Abstract = {{A geophysical survey was carried out on the eastern flank of Piton de la
   Fournaise volcano in the Grand Brule area using combined
   audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) and time domain electromagnetic (TDEM)
   techniques, The aims of the present study were firstly to define the
   shallow geoelectrical structure, and subsequently to locate large bodies
   of ground water with anomalous electrical properties, Most of the AMT
   sites are isotropic across the entire observational bandwidth (7500-10
   Hz), except for a few sites where static-shift effects are present.
   Joint one-dimensional interpretation of the TDEM and AMT data indicates
   basically three-layered structures with the following resistivity zones,
   progressing from the surface downward: (1) a resistive unsaturated
   surface layer of subaerial basaltic flows with a 2000 to 10,000 ohm-m
   resistivity, its base being approximately at mean sea level, (2) an
   intermediate-resistivity layer (100-250 ohm-m) 50-300 m thick,
   interpreted as being fresh-water-saturated basaltic formations, and (3)
   a low-resistivity layer of less than 15 ohm-m probably due to more
   saline water at depth and/or higher clay content in crushed materials,
   In the center of the study area, the results have also shown the
   presence of a prominent boundary dividing the area into a southern zone
   where the aquifer sequence is thin (60-100 m) and a northern zone
   corresponding to a relatively thick aquifer (>150 m), Geoelectrical
   models are compared with the available geological information given by
   two geothermic exploration drillings, The coastal drill hole gives a
   crucial information, i.e. the thick intermediate-resistivity layer in
   the northern part of Grand Brule can be related to water-saturated
   alluvium deposits down to 200 m below sea level, AMT and TDEM soundings
   have revealed a major paleoalluvial drainage system buried under recent
   lava flows. A delimitation of sectors with different hydrogeological
   characteristics can be proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Detail in mapping studies of spatial data results from spatial
   interpolation of field or laboratory measurements. The interpolation
   method used can markedly affect the interpolated estimates and thus the
   appearance of the resulting map. A popular method, oridinary kriging, is
   based on several assumptions, including normally distributed
   observations. For data containing outliers or `'hotspots,'' which are
   common in ground-water monitoring, kriging may not be the most
   appropriate interpolation method. A robust, nonparametric alternative
   was developed, tested, and demonstrated using case-study data from the
   San Luis Valley in Colorado. The method uses a robust measure of spatial
   correlation, called the medogram, as an inverse-distance weight for
   estimates based on LAD (least-absolute-deviation) regression. For both
   synthetic and real case-study data containing a few high values
   (outliers or `'hotspots''), this LAD method showed improved performance
   over ordinary kriging. While performance of the LAD method is slightly
   better than kriging in terms of the mean squared interpolation error for
   the `'contaminated'' data sets studied, the significant advantage of the
   LAD approach is that it does not produce concentric contours around
   observations and thus provides more realistic maps.}},

Abstract = {{Tools for analyzing aquifer test data at the pumping or injection well
   are limited for aquifer conditions that are not axially symmetric about
   the pumping well. Accurate simulations of head change at a pumping well
   can be generated with MODFLOW using a discretization scheme that (1)
   captures steep gradients adjacent to the cell(s) containing the pumping
   or injection well and (2) approximates radial flow despite rectangular
   prism well cell(s). This scheme is based on a very small incremental
   cell width adjacent to the pumping or injection well cell, and then a
   logarithmic increase in cell width outward with the expansion factor,
   alpha, in the range of 1.2 to 1.5. The validity of this scheme has been
   demonstrated by comparing model results with analytical solutions and
   RADMOD (axisymmetric adaptation of MODFLOW) for three radially symmetric
   confined aquifer scenarios, and with the analytical solution for a
   nonaxisymmetric confined aquifer scenario, Utility of this scheme is
   demonstrated with simulation of time-drawdown behavior at the Goddard2
   pumping well in Boise, Idaho where four observation wells did not
   respond during a pumping test and where 28.8 m of drawdown occurred in
   the pumping well during the first 2 min of the test. The hydrogeologic
   setting for the test is interpreted to be a partially penetrating well
   pumping from a sand-stringer aquifer that receives leakage from
   surrounding finer grained sediments, and includes a fault (no-flow
   boundary) truncating the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The Bagnara spring (Central Italy), fed by a fractured, carbonate, and,

   is derived from geological mapping and daily flows over a period of 20
   consecutive years. There are no data on the hydrogeological parameters
   nor on the aquifer hydraulic head, which is known only at the elevation
   of the spring.
   The objective of the work was to construct an appropriate mathematical
   model for the spring despite the scarcity of available information. The
   MODFLOW code was used to simulate the system following the equivalent
   porous media approach. The hydraulic conductivity and the specific yield
   equivalents were estimated by calibrating the model on the master
   depletion curve and taking into consideration the topographic elevation
   of the system's surface. The size of the protection area around the
   spring was investigated on the basis of the isochrons constructed from
   the results of the model.}},

Abstract = {{A single-well, `'push-pull'' test method is proposed for the in situ
   determination of microbial metabolic activities in groundwater aquifers.
   The method consists of the pulse-type injection (''push'') of a test
   solution into the saturated zone of an aquifer through the screen of an
   existing monitoring well followed by the extraction (''pull'') of the
   test solution/ground-water mixture from the same well. The test solution
   contains a tracer and one or more reactive solutes selected to
   investigate specific microbial activities. During the injection phase,
   the test solution flows radially away from the monitoring well into the
   aquifer. Within the aquifer, biologically reactive components of the
   test solution are converted to various products by the indigenous
   microbial community. During the extraction phase, flow is reversed and
   solute concentrations are measured to obtain breakthrough curves, which
   are used to compute the quantities of reactant(s) consumed and/or
   product(s) formed during the test and reaction rates. Tests were
   performed to determine rates of aerobic respiration, denitrification,
   sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis in a petroleum contaminated
   aquifer in western Oregon. High rates of oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, and
   hydrogen utilization and nitrite, and carbon dioxide production support
   the hypothesis that petroleum contamination has resulted in an increase
   in microbial activity in the anaerobic portion of the site, The results
   suggest that the push-pull test method should be useful for obtaining
   quantitative information on a wide range of in situ microbial processes.}},

Abstract = {{Bedrock fractures and results of a 24-well, 21-day pumping test were
   analyzed to characterize a low-yielding fractured gneiss aquifer,
   Several analytical techniques for evaluating aquifer tests in fractured
   bedrock are reviewed and applied. The time-drawdown curve for the
   pumping well and the early time-drawdown responses at several nearby
   observation wells indicate linear flow through a single fracture. In
   contrast, analysis by radial flow techniques of the late time-drawdown
   responses at all observation wells suggests that flow occurs through
   interconnected fractures. Taken together, these time-drawdown responses
   are consistent with a model incorporating linear (single fracture) flow
   at the pumping well and radial (interconnected fracture) flow in an
   outer region.
   The elliptical cone of depression reveals a direction of enhanced
   drawdown which closely parallels one of five observed fracture sets.
   However, this fracture set comprises fewer than 15 percent of all
   fractures present. The drawdown response should not be extrapolated to
   characterize the entire aquifer, because it does not result from an
   overriding structural feature which would influence the aquifer-wide
   hydraulic response.
   The results indicate the advisability of performing structural analysis
   along with aquifer analysis to characterize a bedrock aquifer, Further,
   the results indicate that in an aquifer where the hydraulic response at
   a pumping well suggests linear single fracture flow, if more obsevation
   wells or later time data are available it may be found that the aquifer
   responds with radial flow. The results also suggest that in certain
   bedrock aquifers, the larger the area of investigation, the more likely
   the aquifer will be shown to behave consistently with radial flow
   analytical techniques. In order to obtain the appropriate data, the
   goals of a bedrock pumping test and the structural data should be
   carefully considered before the test duration and observation well
   network are planned.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of parameter uncertainty and overly conservative measures on
   risk assessment has been addressed in numerous researches. Most of the
   work conducted to date is based on the use of the classic Monte Carlo
   simulation method (MCS) as a probabilistic modeling tool. Although the
   MCS is robust and asymptotically convergent, it lacks computational
   efficiency when the simulated probability is small. Furthermore, the
   sensitivity information can only be obtained with additional
   computational effort. First- and second-order reliability methods (FORM
   and SORM) have been developed in the structural analysis field and have
   been recently applied to ground-water contaminant transport and
   remediation problems. In this work, we extend the application of the
   reliability methods to the probabilistic assessment of cancer risk due
   to ground-water contamination. Results of the reliability methods
   compared well with a published case study of PCE contamination of a
   ground-water supply in California. The target risk level is extended
   over a larger range, and the sensitivity of the probability of failure
   to the relevant random variables is analyzed. The application of the
   methods to another case study, cancer risk due to the ingestion of
   benzene contaminated water, further illustrates a systematic way of
   directly accounting for the intrinsic uncertainty of the transport and
   fate model parameters involved in the risk assessment procedure. The
   probability of exceeding the target risk level in this case was found to
   be most sensitive to the uncertainty in the parameters describing the
   ground-water transport process.}},

Abstract = {{Various geologic, hydrologic, and geochemical methods were used to
   assess active ground-water circulation in a brine-filled, deep (> 50 m
   below land surface) aquitard underlying the Oak Ridge Reservation,
   Tennessee. In places, the brine which was presumed to be stagnant in the
   past, contains various contaminants. If ground-water circulation is
   viable in the brine-containing formations, then remediation or
   containment of the deep-seated contaminants should be considered a high
   priority. Data used to determine this included (1) spatial and temporal
   pressures and hydraulic heads measured in the aquitard, (2) hydraulic
   parameters of the formations in question, (3) vertical temperature
   gradients, and (4) spatial and temporal chemical and isotopic
   composition of the saline ground water. Conclusions suggest that the
   saline water contained at depth is not isolated (in terms of recharge
   and discharge) from the overlying active and fresh-water- (< 500 mg/l)
   bearing units, Consequently, influx of young water (and contamination)
   from land surface does occur. Potential discharge into the shallow
   aquifers was assumed where the hydraulic head of the saline water was
   higher than that in the shallow aquifers, accounting for temperature and
   salinity anomalies observed close to land surface. The confined water
   (and dissolved solutes) move along open conduits at relatively high
   velocity into adjacent, more permeable units.}},

Abstract = {{The study of the ancient Inca water supply of Machu Picchu was performed
   by the authors under an archaeological permit issued by the Peruvian
   Government in 1994. The study included an evaluation of the hydrogeology
   of the ancient spring water supply situated on the north slope of the
   mountain of Machu Picchu and its relationship to the Machu Picchu fault.
   Based on field measurements, the yield of the primary spring has a
   seasonal variation of between 25 and 125 liters per minute. This flow
   adequately provided the domestic water requirements of up to 1000
   inhabitants of the mountain top royal retreat of the Inca ruler
   Pachacuti, occupied primarily between 1450 and 1540 AD. The permanent
   population between visits of the Inca ruler was about 300. Final
   abandonment occurred in 1572 AD. The estimated geologic catchment area
   related to the Machu Picchu fault is roughly 50 percent greater than the
   topographic basin area. A 749 meter-long canal delivered the spring flow
   to the center of the community to serve a total of 16 water supply
   fountains.
   A theory that a water shortage caused Machu Picchu to be abandoned
   proved to be unsubstantiated based on a study of the Quelccaya Ice Cap
   corings data that demonstrated that the last decade of the occupation
   was wetter than the previous eight decades. The builders of Machu Picchu
   developed a community domestic water supply using the spring and a
   hydraulic infrastructure in an effective and efficient manner. They
   utilized a gravity flow canal sized to carry the spring flow with a
   suitable safety factor against overtopping.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effect of barometric pressure changes on the water-level
   elevations in wells tapping unconfined aquifers is often ignored or
   considered to be negligibly small. However, under certain circumstances,
   wells in unconfined aquifers can have barometric efficiencies greater
   than those typically observed for wells in confined aquifers. This is
   illustrated by results of a study performed at a federal Superfund site
   where a contaminated portion of the unconfined aquifer is isolated by a
   soil-bentonite cutoff wall and clay cap. A well located within the
   containment system displays water-level fluctuations which mirror
   barometric pressure changes. During the study, water-level elevation
   ranged 36.6 centimeters (cm) {[}1.20 feet (ft)] in response to
   barometric pressure changes of 2.87 centimeters mercury (cm-Hg) {[}1.13
   inches mercury (in-Hg)]-a barometric efficiency of about 94 percent(\%).
   A well screened similarly outside the containment system did not display
   any observable barometric pressure effects. Vertical transmission of
   barometric pressure changes to the water table inside the containment
   system is retarded by the clay cap, and the soil-bentonite cutoff wall
   retards the lateral transmission of barometric pressure changes from the
   unsaturated zone outside the containment system. Water-level
   fluctuations of the magnitude observed during this study may need to be
   considered when developing monitoring programs to assess the performance
   of remedial systems.}},

Abstract = {{Type curves derived from Theis' exact nonequilibrium well function
   solution are proposed for graphical estimation of aquifer hydraulic
   properties, transmissivity (T), and storage coefficient (S), from
   water-level recovery data after cessation of a constant-rate discharge
   test. Drawdown (on log scale) is plotted versus the ratio of time since
   pumping stopped to duration of pumping, a normalized time. Under Theis
   conditions, individual type curves depend on only the dimensionless
   pumping duration, which depends in turn on S and radial distance from
   the pumping well. Type curve matching, in contrast to the Theis
   procedure for pumping data, is performed by shifting only the drawdown
   axis; the time axis is fixed because it is a relative or normalized
   time. The match-point for the drawdown axis is used to compute T, and S
   is determined from matching the curve shape, which depends on early
   dimensionless-time data. Multiple well data can be plotted and matched
   simultaneously (a composite plot), with drawdown at different radial
   distances matching different curves. The ratio of dimensionless pumping
   durations for any two matched curves is equal to one over the squared
   ratio of radial distances. Application to two recovery datasets from the
   literature confirm the utility of these type curves in normalized time
   for composite estimation of T and S.}},

Abstract = {{Herbicide compounds were prevalent in ground water across Iowa, being
   detected in 70\% of the 106 municipal wells sampled during the summer of
   1995, Herbicide degradation products were three of the four most
   frequently detected compounds for this study. The degradation product
   alachlor ethanesulfonic acid was the most frequently detected compound
   (65.1\%), followed by atrazine (40.6\%), and the degradation products
   deethylatrazine (34.9\%), and cyanazine amide (19.8\%). The corn
   herbicide acetochlor, first registered for widespread use in the United
   States in March 1994, was detected in a single water sample, No reported
   herbicide compound concentrations for this study exceeded current U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency's maximum contaminant levels or health
   advisory levels for drinking water, although the herbicide degradation
   products examined have get to have such levels established.
   The occurrence of herbicide compounds had a significant, inverse
   relation to well depth and a significant, positive relation to
   dissolved-oxygen concentration. It is felt that both well depth and
   dissolved oxygen are acting as rough surrogates to ground-water age,
   with younger ground water being more likely to contain herbicide
   compounds. The occurrence of herbicide compounds was substantially
   different among the major aquifer types across Iowa, being detected in
   82.5\% of the alluvial, 81.8\% of the bedrock/ karst region, 40.0\% of
   the glacial-drift, and 25.0\% of the bedrock/nonkarst region aquifers.
   The observed distribution was partially attributed to variations in
   general ground-water age among these aquifer types. A significant,
   inverse relation was determined between total herbicide compound
   concentrations in ground water and the average soil slope within a 2-km
   radius of sampled wens. Steeper soil slopes may increase the likelihood
   of surface runoff occurring rather than ground-water
   infiltration-decreasing the transport of herbicide compounds to ground
   water. As expected, a significant positive relation was determined
   between intensity of herbicide use and herbicide concentrations in
   ground water.}},

Abstract = {{The 1986 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments include provisions for state
   wellhead protection (WHP) programs that address wellhead protection
   areas (WHPAs). In many states, WHPAs are delineated based on
   time-of-travel (TOT) criteria. This study compares 250-day and 15-year
   TOT capture zones computed in a confined to semiconfined aquifer system
   in an alluvial basin rising semianalytical and two- and
   three-dimensional numerical ground-water flow models, and evaluates the
   relative importance df several sources of uncertainty, such as aquifer
   hydraulic conductivity, aquitard leakance, vertical transit time,
   hydraulic gradients, transient pumping effects, well interference, and
   three-dimensional aquifer geometries.
   A numerical model should be used to delineate 15-year TOT capture zones
   for wells in confined to semiconfined aquifers in alluvial basins. A
   semianalytical program may be acceptable for computing the 250-day TOT
   capture zones; however, such codes can be applied only under a very
   narrow range of conditions.
   Hydraulic conductivity plays a critical role in controlling the sizes
   and shapes of capture zones computed in confined to semiconfined
   aquifers. Small, circular capture zones are computed in low hydraulic
   conductivity areas, More complex geometries should be expected where
   hydraulic conductivities are higher and pumping wells are in close
   proximity to each other. Aquifers with horizontal hydraulic
   conductivities that are greater than 1,000 times the vertical hydraulic
   conductivity of the overlying aquitard are effectively fully confined,
   and larger capture zones would be computed for these aquifers than for
   semiconfined aquifers where significant leakage is induced by pumping.
   In addition, relatively large drawdowns are computed in low hydraulic
   conductivity areas, resulting in short vertical transit times. Vertical
   transit times are longer where aquifer hydraulic conductivities are
   higher.}},

Abstract = {{A steady-state test to determine the hydraulic properties of an aquifer
   is presented, The test uses an injection-extraction well-pair to
   establish a two-dimensional, steady-state flow field in the tested
   region. At least one observation well is needed to measure the hydraulic
   head within the flow field, Depending on the number of observation
   wells, a single-observation-well method or a distance-head method is
   used to analyze the head data, Two field examples demonstrate the
   potential application of the test. The field experiments were done at
   the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford site near Richland, Washington.
   The two-well test procedure described in this work provides a useful
   alternative for characterizing aquifers while deploying in situ
   ground-water remediation systems, One of the most attractive features of
   this test, especially at contaminated aquifers, is that there is no
   water to dispose. The test is simple and economical, and it also avoids
   several other limitations associated with typical pumping or slug tests.}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{The present study concerns the application of a new numerical approach
   to describe the fresh-water/sea-water relationships in coastal aquifers.
   Essentially, a solution to the partial differential equation governing
   the regional motion of a phreatic surface and the resulting interface
   between fresh water and salt water is analyzed by a Galerkin
   finite-element formulation. A single-phase steady numerical model was
   applied to approximate, with simple triangular elements, the regional
   behavior of a coastal aquifer under appropriate sinks, sources, Neumann,
   outflow face, and open boundary conditions. On the one hand, outflow
   open boundaries at the coastline were not treated with other classical
   boundary conditions (Dirichlet or the outflow face approach), but
   instead with a formal numerical approach for open boundaries inspired in
   this particular case by the Dupuit approximation of horizontal outflow
   at the boundary. The solution to this numerical model, together with the
   Ghyben-Herzberg principle, allows the correct simulation of fresh-water
   heads and the position of the salt-water interface for a steeply sloping
   coast. Although the solutions were precise and do not present classical
   numerical oscillations, this approach requires a previous solution with
   Dirichlet boundary conditions at the coastline in order to find a good
   convergence of the solution algorithm. On the other hand, the same
   precise results were obtained with a more restrictive open boundary
   condition, similar in a way to the outlow face approach, which required
   less computer time, did not need a prior numerical solution and could be
   extended to different coastline conditions. The steady-state problem was
   solved for different hypothetical coastal aquifers and fresh-water usage
   through three types of numerical tests. calculated fresh-water heads,
   interface positions and discharges show very precise results throughout
   the domain and especially at the coastline when compared to analytical,
   experimental, and numerically correct solutions. Therefore, interface
   positions, fresh-water heads, and discharges originating from the steady
   regional behavior of coastal aquifers can be precisely predicted by
   numerical modeling when open boundaries towards the sea are properly
   treated for the likely conditions of the coastline.}},

Abstract = {{Drive-point ground-water samplers, designed to enable delineation of the
   vertical and areal extent of a contaminant plume, have been modified to
   obtain an in situ measurement of hydraulic conductivity in aquifers. The
   multlevel drive-point sampler (MLDPS) consists of a 30-cm long screen
   pushed to a desired depth within a retractable outer sleeve and a
   pressure transducer to monitor the rate of fill within a sample chamber.
   The accuracy and variability of a MLDPS to measure hydraulic
   conductivity was evaluated in a 50-m(3) laboratory aquifer comprised of
   a uniform medium sand. Twelve measurements were performed using the
   MLDPS followed by duplicate slug tests performed at identical locations
   and depths within the aquifer. MLDPS and slug test data were analyzed
   using the method of Widdowson et al. (1990). The MLDPS provided an
   estimation of hydraulic conductivity at least one order of magnitude
   below slug test-derived hydraulic conductivity and the range of
   hydraulic conductivity associated with a medium sand. MLDPS-derived
   hydraulic conductivity values also show greater variability and range
   relative to the slug test-derived values. Hydraulic conductivity ranges
   from 0.072 to 2.3 m/d using the MLDPS (coefficient of variation = C-v =
   1.3) compared to a range of 10 to 16 m/d (C-v = 0.14) for the slug test
   values. Variability and magnitude of the MLDPS-derived hydraulic
   conductivity is attributed to disturbance of aquifer material and
   experimental factors inherent to the design of the instrument.}},

Abstract = {{A finite-element package has been developed for the U.S. Geological
   Survey Modular Ground-Water Flow Model, MODFLOW (McDonald and Harbaugh,
   1988). The package, entitled the Node Centered Flow (NCF) Package,
   offers alternatives for constructing and solving ground-water flow
   problems. As with MODFLOW's Block Centered Flow (BCF) package, NCF uses
   a finite-difference solution for vertical flow, but unlike BCF it uses a
   2d Galerkin finite-element solution for flow within a layer. The
   algorithm used in NCF is described in Neuman et al. (1982). This
   technique permits simulation within a layer of off-diagonal elements in
   the (2 X 2) transmissivity or hydraulic conductivity tensor. The most
   advantageous feature of the NCF Package is the capability for designing
   a nonrectangular grid. User specification of the horizontal (x, y)
   coordinates of individual nodes allows model features such as meandering
   stream channels, faults, and wells to be more precisely represented. NCF
   uses the same input style as BCF and will be immediately familiar to
   MODFLOW users; BCF input files are also easily converted to NCF input
   files. NCF parameters are input by layer, row, and column, allowing NCF
   and BCF to work with all of the same MODFLOW packages with the exception
   of matrix solving packages.}},

Abstract = {{A fully instrumented physical model was designed and built to reproduce
   development by surging and monitor its effects during surging and after
   development. The model simulates a horizontal layer in a confined
   aquifer with control of vertical overburden pressure. An automatic
   apparatus produced development by surging in successive phases up to 24
   hours. Aquifer tests in steady-state conditions were performed between
   successive phases. The paper reports the main results of three
   experiments performed with Johnson screens 200 mm in diameter; they had
   slot sizes between the D-54 and D-70 of the aquifer soil, This soil was
   placed under controlled conditions, and initial homogeneity was obtained
   as confirmed by initial control tests. Pore pressures (and thus
   hydraulic heads) were continuously monitored during development phases
   and aquifer tests by 22 electronic piezometers at distances between 0
   and 1 m from the screen, These piezometers measured water pressures
   every 0.1 s when required, Solid particles passing through the screen
   were recovered to study the solid yield and the gradation of particles.
   Positive and negative values of local gradients reached values up to 400
   close to the screen at the beginning of development and decreased with
   time of development. These high values produced high seepage forces
   displacing particles in the aquifer. The well yield was increased by a
   factor of 6 after development. These model test results confirmed
   empirical criteria on entrance velocity, internal stability criteria,
   and field values of `'sand'' production by development. In addition,
   they enabled a quantification of skin effects to be considered in
   interpreting an aquifer test.}},

Abstract = {{A sand and gravel quarry was simultaneously operated as a landfill. The
   underlying contaminated aquifer is unconfined at the landfill and
   becomes confined as it dips to the north. A ground-water model based on
   the MODFLOW program was developed to evaluate remediation alternatives
   and provide a basis for modifying the Record of Decision for the site.
   Hydraulic conductivities were contoured and continuously varied across
   the modeled area instead of defining zones of constant hydraulic
   conductivities. The model was calibrated by matching monthly water
   levels and travel times for nonadsorbing contaminants to migrate from
   the landfill to the extent of the contaminant plume. Drawdown data from
   a 72-hour pump test were used to confirm the model's ability to predict
   an accurate response to pumping stresses and to reduce the uncertainty
   of the model.
   Modeling indicated that ground-water recharge was required to prevent
   soil desaturation, minimize recontamination of ground water due to
   rebounding water levels, and to provide continuous flushing of the
   soils. The ground-water extraction system designed for the site,
   consisting of eight extraction wells and one recharge trench, was
   predicted to reverse the natural ground-water gradients observed at the
   edge of the contaminant plume, minimize travel distance for
   contaminants, and reduce contaminated ground-water flow through clean
   aquifer soils. Recharged water was predicted to flow through the most
   heavily contaminated soils and be captured primarily by two extraction
   wells closest to the landfill. Model results were used to successfully
   modify the existing Record of Decision design.}},

Title = {{Delineating the chemical composition of the salinity source for saline

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of significant water-rock interaction, the chemical
   composition of a saline brine polluting a ground-water aquifer can be
   delineated from conservative-mixing relations. An example is the
   Mississippi River Alluvium Aquifer, within Angelina Plantation in
   east-central Concordia Parish, Louisiana, which has high ground-water
   salinities, of unknown origin.
   Chloride concentrations are linearly correlated with concentrations of
   major cations and with bromide and iodide. These relationships are
   consistent with mixing of fresh water with a saline source of either a
   single brine or multiple brines of similar composition and with a lack
   of significant water-rock interactions in the ground water during and
   after mixing.
   The saline source has the following predicted mass ratios for a brine
   containing 80,000 ppm Cl: Na/Cl, 0.58; Br/Cl, 0.0013; I/Cl, 0.00028;
   Sr/Cl, 0.0026; K/Cl, 0.0035; CaCl, 0.035; and Mg/Cl, 0.0080. The
   predicted Sr-87/Sr-86, ratio is 0.70805. The mass ratios fall within the
   range of Tertiary oil-field brines in the Louisiana Gulf Coast. The
   major reservoir for hydrocarbon production in the area is the Wilcox
   Formation; however, the `'predicted'' source brine is unlikely to be a
   `'pure'' Wilcox brine from Concordia Parish. Ratios of Sr-87/Sr-86 are
   usually lower and bromide, iodide, and calcium concentrations are always
   lower in the Wilcox brines than predicted in the saline source.}},

Abstract = {{Recovery of mobile Nonaqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs), referred to as
   `'oil recovery,'' is one of the most common remedial technologies
   currently being implemented at sites where NAPLs have been released. The
   rationale for oil recovery typically includes resource recovery,
   mitigation of further NAPL migration, and compliance with regulatory
   mandates for source reduction. Efficient oil recovery can be achieved by
   optimizing conditions within the oil flow path. This concept is referred
   to as flow path management. Building on this concept, a waterflood oil
   recovery technique utilizing dual recovery and parallel delivery
   drainlines has been developed for recovery of creosote-based
   wood-treating oil, a Dense Nonaqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL). Full-scale
   application of this technique at a contaminated site has yielded 1.5
   million gallons of DNAPL. Furthermore, an operational endpoint of 95
   percent recovery of the mobile oil is being achieved. Building on the
   concept of flow path management and the observed performance of the
   waterflood oil recovery system, a first-order analytical solution for
   DNAPL flow to a drainline has been derived and validated using field
   data. This solution leads to a set of useful design equations and
   further insight into the factors that control oil recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The case study presented in this paper illustrates how statistical

   wells and pollutant sources in alluvial systems. The observation of a
   time series of chloride concentrations in a specific well in Strasbourg,
   France, influenced by the infiltration of chlorinated water from the
   Rhine river, made it possible to derive a two-predictor model of the
   water quality in the well. This model combines a linear dependence upon
   a time-lagged chloride concentration in the river, reflecting the
   steady-state water balance in the well, and a nonlinear dependence upon
   average lagged water output pumped from the well. This simple model
   explains 86\% of the variance in well chloride concentration measured
   weekly over a two year period.}},

   to map the spatial distribution of an electrically conductive zone
   within a hydrologically complex limestone environment. Advantage has
   been taken of a `'natural'' conductive tracer provided by salt-water
   migration resulting from long-term pumping at a `'well'' within the
   fieldsite. The resistivity distribution of 13 between-borehole planes
   has been reconstructed from borehole resistance measurements, and
   comparisons between resistivity images obtained prior to, and during,
   saline migration have been made. The distribution of resistivity
   obtained from the a priori measurements revealed the location of
   electrically conductive pathways between boreholes which correlate with
   cavity features obtained from Borehole Television (BHTV) logging. The
   continuity of these pathways between boreholes suggests the presence of
   a laterally extensive electrically conductive zone. The reconstruction
   of differences in resistivity caused by the salt-water migration
   confirmed the presence of this conductive zone and has shown that the
   saline water passed primarily through this zone. This preferential flow
   illustrates the hydrological importance of this zone and suggests that
   it is not only an electrically conductive, but also a highly
   hydraulically conductive feature.}},

Abstract = {{In many situations, inadequate design or performance of ground-water
   remediation systems is the result of underestimation of aquifer
   hydraulic heterogeneity, and in particular, the vertical variation of
   hydraulic conductivity which plays an important role in contaminant
   migration, Described herein are applications of the electromagnetic (EM)
   borehole flowmeter to fluvial sediments in Louisiana and South Carolina,
   The direction of natural vertical flow in the test aquifers was defined
   easily, and short pumping tests enabled the calculation of hydraulic
   conductivity profiles for each test well, The results correlated well
   with other information obtained independently, including natural gamma
   logs, driller's logs and a hydraulic conductivity profile based on grain
   size analysis, Large variations in hydraulic conductivity over short
   vertical and horizontal distances were documented, Tests in
   gravel-packed wells suggested that flowmeters produce misleading data
   for a variety of reasons in such situations, Among other things, an
   annulus of high permeability around a well screen allows flow to bypass
   the meter, and the phenomenon is amplified by high pumping rates, The
   resulting error is displayed as an erroneous high permeability zone at
   the top of the well screen, This observation deserves further study, In
   its present form the EM flowmeter is awkward to handle on a routine
   basis, However, none of the present design flaws preclude its effective
   use.}},

Abstract = {{Definition of the hydrologic framework in layered sediments of fluvial
   and deltaic origin is a difficult challenge for environmental
   characterization and remediation pro grams due to the lithologic and
   stratigraphic heterogeneities inherent in these settings, We set out to
   use complementary geophysical surveys to determine the nature and extent
   of a deep confining unit at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina,
   Time Domain Electromagnetic (TDEM) soundings were used to define the
   electrical conductance of the clayey confining unit (aquitard), and
   shear-wave reflection seismic was used to define the stratigraphic
   framework, Based on correlations with borehole geophysical logs and
   sieve data, the shear-wave seismic proved capable of defining relatively
   fine layering in the coastal plain sediments, the upper and lower
   surfaces of a critical confining unit, and erosional features on the
   surface of the confining unit. The TDEM surveys defined the presence or
   absence of the clay facies of the confining unit. Moreover, by
   constraining the interpretation of the TDEM data with the thickness of
   the confining unit derived from the seismic data, we mapped the extent
   of the unit, showing where the clay is thicker, where it probably was
   never deposited, and where it was eroded by downcutting channels, These
   results have significant implications on the design and optimization of
   remedial systems.}},

Abstract = {{The theory of ground-water flow in fractured rocks has been used to
   interpret aquifer tests and streamflow data for the Oak Ridge
   Reservation of U.S. Department of Energy. This interpretation has
   resulted in a better understanding of the data needed for ground-water
   models. The hydraulic conductivity values calculated from most aquifer
   tests are meaningless. Slug tests and early data from pumping tests
   measure the total transmissivity of all fractures within the area of
   influence; this value can be used to calculate rates of ground-water
   flow and transport near the well. Larger transmissivity values are
   calculated from late aquifer-test data and from an analysis of
   streamflow hydrographs because most ground-water flow occurs in a thin
   layer at the water table, This layer supplies most ground-water
   discharge to streams and apparently is a late-time water source for
   pumpage from deeper wells.
   The calibration of distributed flow and transport models will be
   difficult, if not impossible, because about 90\% of the ground-water
   flow occurs in only 10\% of the area, and the locations of these flow
   paths are unknown. Also, large changes in transmissivity occur with
   recharge and discharge cycles that change the saturated thickness of the
   permeable layer near the water table.}},

Abstract = {{Upward water flow can arrest the downward migration of dense, nonaqueous
   phase liquids (DNAPLs) through rough-walled fractures provided that a
   sufficient hydraulic gradient exists. An exact analytical solution to
   predict the arresting gradient demonstrates that there is little
   difference between the gradient required to arrest DNAPL migration near
   the top of the fracture, and the gradient required to arrest migration
   once DNAPL has extended to the bottom of the fracture. Laboratory
   experiments involving the migration of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) through
   two samples of fractured limestone demonstrate the ability of upward
   water flow to arrest downward DNAPL migration under both wetting and
   drainage conditions. It is suggested that upward gradients can be
   generated beneath contaminated regions of the subsurface to provide a
   `'hydraulic bottom.'' A hydraulic bottom at a site would protect against
   potential downward mobilization of DNAPL in response to the application
   of aggressive remediation technologies such as surfactant flooding,
   alcohol flooding, and steam flooding. Upward gradients applied during
   drilling may also protect against downward mobilization of DNAPL in the
   formation while drilling through source zones.}},

Abstract = {{Three-hundred eight slug tests were conducted in a 5 x 5 m area in a
   coastal, sandy aquifer at the Georgetown site in South Carolina to
   characterize three-dimensional aquifer heterogeneity. Methods developed
   by Hvorslev, Bouwer and Rice, and Cooper et al. were employed to
   estimate hydraulic conductivity values from the slug test data. These
   three methods produced similar spatial distributions of the hydraulic
   conductivity but quite different values. Overall, the method of Cooper
   et al. produces higher conductivity values in high permeability zones
   but lower values in low permeability areas than the Hvorslev method.
   Variances of the natural log of conductivity values derived from
   Hvorslev's and Bouwer and Rice's methods agree with those in the other
   aquifers under similar depositional environments. However, the variance
   calculated for the data based on the method of Cooper et al. appears
   unreasonably large. Despite these differences, histograms of the three
   sets of conductivity values exhibit bimodal distributions, reflecting
   stratification of the aquifer. Geostatistical analyses show that
   correlation lengths and statistical anisotropy of the hydraulic
   conductivity spatial structure varies with depth.}},

Abstract = {{Failing to account for barometric pressure effects in water level
   measurements can introduce errors by misestimating the total head and by
   adding noise to water level measurements, For determining the total head
   in an aquifer, we assert that the air pressure head at the water surface
   in the well must be added to measured water levels (equivalent to using
   an absolute pressure transducer) even though the resulting values may
   have larger temporal and spatial variability than the original water
   level measurements, At the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the
   average barometric pressure variation is 6 to 7 cm, with a range of over
   30 cm, Failure to account for barometric pressure variability could
   result in misestimation of the direction and magnitude of the hydraulic
   gradient at the site, We also demonstrate procedures for removing
   barometric effects, such as to reduce noise during an aquifer pumping
   test, and to identify mechanisms by which barometric pressure affects
   water levels, Three mechanisms are summarized including: an
   instantaneous response for confined aquifers; a delayed response due to
   borehole storage in confined and unconfined aquifers; and a delayed
   response in unconfined aquifers due to the passage of barometric
   pressure changes through the unsaturated zone, Using data from the
   Savannah River Site, barometric efficiencies are estimated using linear
   regression and a modification of Clark's Method, Delayed responses are
   estimated using regression deconvolution, The type of barometric effect
   provides diagnostic information about whether the aquifer is confined or
   not, the presence of borehole storage or skin effects, and the air
   diffusivity coefficient within the unsaturated zone, We also show how
   removal of barometric pressure effects improves the ability to observe
   otherwise unnoticeable effects.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison between two hypothetical flow models of an unconfined
   aquifer, one saturated and the other variably saturated, indicates that
   the variably saturated model which explicitly models drainage from the
   unsaturated zone provides a better conceptual framework for analyzing
   unconfined aquifer test data and better estimates of the lateral and
   vertical hydraulic conductivity in fine-grained sands, Explicitly
   accounting for multiple aquifers, well-bore storage, and the effects of
   delayed drainage from the unsaturated zone increases confidence in
   aquifer property estimates by removing some assumptions and allowing for
   the inclusion of early time data and water-table observations in an
   aquifer test analysis, The inclusion of the unsaturated zone expands the
   number of parameters to be estimated, but reasonable estimates of
   lateral and vertical hydraulic conductivity and specific storage of the
   unconfined aquifer can be obtained. For the cases examined, only the van
   Genuchten parameter a needed to be determined by the test, because the
   parameters n and theta(r) had a minimal effect on the estimates of
   hydraulic conductivities, and literature values could be used for these
   parameters, Estimates of lateral and vertical hydraulic conductivity
   using MODFLOW were not as good as the VS2DT based estimates and differed
   from the known values by as much as 30 percent.
   The hydraulic properties of a surficial aquifer system were estimated
   through a series of aquifer tests conducted at Cecil Field Naval Air
   Station in Jacksonville, Florida. Aquifer test results were analyzed by
   calibrating a variably saturated, radial flow model to the measured
   drawdowns. Parameter estimation was performed by minimizing the
   difference between simulated and measured drawdowns with an optimization
   routine coupled to VS2DT and was constrained by assuming that the
   hydraulic properties of each aquifer or confining unit were homogeneous,
   Given the hydrogeologic conditions at the field site, estimating the
   hydraulic properties of the aquifers and confining units with
   analytically derived type curves would have been inappropriate,
   Estimates of the lateral hydraulic conductivity from the VS2DT solution
   were more consistent with the observed geology than estimates from Theis
   analyses, which ranged from 20 to 80 percent more than the final
   estimates. The unsaturated zone affected an aquifer test conducted in a
   leaky aquifer about 100 feet below land surface more than the other two
   aquifer tests because about half of the pumped water came from the
   overlying, unconfined aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of ground-water flow in a generic aquifer system were made
   to characterize the topology of ground-water flow in the stream
   subsystem and to evaluate its relation to deeper ground-water flow, The
   flow models are patterned after hydraulic characteristics of aquifers of
   the Atlantic Coastal Plain and are based on numerical solutions to
   three-dimensional, steady-state, unconfined flow, The models were used
   to evaluate the effects of aquifer horizontal-to-vertical hydraulic
   conductivity ratios, aquifer thickness, and areal recharge rates on flow
   in the stream subsystem, A particle tracker was used to determine flow
   paths in a stream subsystem, to establish the relation between
   ground-water seepage to points along a simulated stream and its source
   area of flow, and to determine ground-water residence time in stream
   subsystems. In a geometrically simple aquifer system with accretion, the
   source area of flow to streams resembles an elongated ellipse that
   tapers in the downgradient direction, Increased recharge causes an
   expansion of the stream subsystem, The source area of flow to the stream
   expands predominantly toward the stream headwaters. Baseflow gain is
   also increased along the reach of the stream, A thin aquifer restricts
   ground-water flow and causes the source area of flow to expand near
   stream headwaters and also shifts the start-of-flow to the drainage
   basin divide, Increased aquifer anisotropy causes a lateral expansion of
   the source area of flow to streams.
   Ground-water seepage to the stream channel originates both from near-
   and far-recharge locations. The range in the lengths of flow paths that
   terminate at a point on a stream increase in the downstream direction,
   Consequently, the age distribution of ground water that seeps into the
   stream is skewed progressively older with distance downstream. Base flow
   ia an integration of ground water with varying age and potentially
   different water quality, depending on the source within the drainage
   basin, The quantitative results presented indicate that this integration
   can have a wide and complex residence time range and source
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Boshan is an industrial city in the center of Shandong Province where
   ground water is the only source for the urban water supply. The major
   water resource is fracture-karst water in the middle Ordovician
   carbonate rocks. Based on the hydrogeological investigation and mapping
   in this area we studied the geologic and hydrogeologic settings, the
   major pollution sources and the pathways of contamination, the principal
   contaminants, and their spatial distribution in ground water. The
   ground-water quality has also been estimated by the fuzzy mathematic
   method. The geostatistical method, such as the kriging method, was taken
   to simulate spatial distribution of the contaminants. The grey system
   method was adopted to forecast future contamination. An attempt at the
   remediation of Cr6+ contamination in fracture-karst water was also
   discussed. Finally, some proposals for the protection of the
   ground-water environment in Boshan District are offered.}},

Pages = {{546-550}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Various numerical methods have been developed to solve aquifer tests and
   eliminate the subjectivity of traditional graphical type curve methods.
   The slope-matching method, which matches the slope of the field data to
   the slope of the Theis type curve, can be used to numerically solve pump
   tests for both leaky and nonleaky aquifers.
   The slope-matching method was selected for implementation into a C/C++
   computer program. The computerized version has the following advantages
   over the original hand calculator version: (1) it eliminates human error
   inherent in hand calculations; (2) it has the ability to quickly analyze
   large data sets and large numbers of data sets; and (3) it can be used
   on portable computers to analyze test data in the field,
   When performed by hand, the slope-matching method requires the
   interpolation of values from tables for values of Theis curve slopes and
   the Bessel function Ko. For the computer implementation, an iterative
   `'guess-and-correct'' algorithm was developed to eliminate the need to
   interpolate from tables.
   The computer program shows a good correlation with results obtained by
   hand calculations for both leaky and nonleaky aquifers, using the same
   method, Discrepancies with hand calculations are traced to rounding
   errors in the estimation of W(u) and elimination of the need to
   interpolate values from tables.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{195-204}},

Abstract = {{The prevalent and straightforward routine of impulsively collecting
   masses of new data for studies relating to ground-water contamination
   can be inefficient and costly as it does not provide optimal value from
   existing hydrogeologic and other information. A preliminary guidance
   framework is outlined, for early stage monetary risk assessments prior
   to any new measurements, considering both the probability and the
   economical consequences of contamination. The framework is aimed at
   providing a basis for cost-effective decision-making regarding
   ground-water protection and management actions. It centers on improved
   conceptual hydrogeological site descriptions based on existing
   information and professional judgments prior to any new measurements. A
   key aspect of the framework is to derive maximum possible quantitative
   understanding of risks from limited prior available qualitative
   information. The framework has a dual-site approach, assuming a
   situation of a contaminant source site and a receptor site. A two-step
   procedure leads to the monetary risk assessment with respect to existing
   compliance levels: (1) conceptual model development, and (2)
   quantitative model realization, addressing the probability of
   contaminant release at the contamination source, the hydraulic
   connection between the source and the receptor, and the contaminant
   transport conditions. The purpose of the framework is twofold: (1) to
   provide a risk assessment framework which optimizes use of professional
   judgment for studies where data are limited, and (2) to give synergistic
   interpretive values that complement field measurements and that can be
   used as prior estimates in more detailed studies.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The expense of characterizing aquifer spatial variability often results
   in a lack of available or realistically obtainable direct measurement
   data for ground-water system simulation. As a consequence ground-water
   models that are able to utilize imprecise or `'soft'' information need
   to be developed. In this paper, a methodology based on fuzzy set theory
   is developed to incorporate imprecise data into transient ground-water
   flow simulation. The imprecise model parameters may come from indirect
   measurements, expert judgment, and subjective interpretation of
   available information. Fuzzy numbers are used to represent imprecise
   parameters. They are also used as a measure of the uncertainty
   associated with the hydraulic head due to the imprecision of input data.
   A fuzzy ground-water flow model is developed by linking the
   finite-difference method with fuzzy number representations. Fuzzy number
   operations (cy-level cuts) are used to solve the resulting fuzzy
   ground-water now model and are extended to consider the dependencies
   among hydraulic head coefficients. With the fuzzy number inputs, the
   transient fuzzy ground-water flow model provides a direct measure of
   hydraulic head uncertainties in the time domain. The model outputs can
   be used as the inputs for subsequent risk analysis and decision-making
   processes. The fuzzy modeling technique can handle imprecise information
   directly without generating a large number of realizations. It is also
   flexible as it can handle different types of membership functions
   describing fuzzy input parameters. The methodology can be used to
   combine data with different levels of quality into groundwater flow
   models and provides a realistic method to handle parameter imprecision,
   especially expert judgment and subjective information. A numerical model
   based on the methodology was tested against the Theis analytical
   solution for a homogeneous aquifer with pumping. The tested model was
   also applied to two different heterogeneous flow fields to demonstrate
   the methodology.}},

Abstract = {{A resistivity survey was conducted in the Nile Delta area to delineate
   ground-water contamination caused by an improper sewage and irrigation
   drainage system, leaching from old lagoonal deposits, and salt-water
   intrusion, Existing monitoring wells were used to measure the horizontal
   and vertical variations in water salinity, Vertical electrical sounding
   (VES) data for sounding points located near monitoring wells, together
   with the water salinity data of these wells, were used to obtain an
   empirical relationship between the inferred earth resistivity and the
   amount of total dissolved solids, This relationship was used together
   with the constructed apparent resistivity depth and geoelectric
   longitudinal sections to identify three zones of water-bearing formation
   (fresh-, brackish-, and salt-water zones), Along the studied profile,
   depth to the fresh-brackish interface exceeds 150 m at Tanta City and
   decreases northward to 40 m or less between Qutor and Kafr El-Sheikh,
   Depth to the brackish-saline interface exceeds 180 m south of
   Kafr-El-Sheikh and decreases northward to 70 m near Hadadi village.}},

Abstract = {{Twelve ground-water samples were collected in the Nag Hammadi area, from

   that the main recharge source of the Quaternary aquifer is the recent

   Lake Nasser, Sources of recharge to the Plio-Pleistocene aquifer are:
   (1) Old Nile water depleted in isotope composition, which was trapped in
   the geological formation, characterized by low permeability and clay
   lenses prior to the construction of the Aswan High Dam; and (2) The
   leakage of palaeo water from the deep aquifer system through main faults
   which bisect the study area, The variation in the chemistry of ground

Abstract = {{The ground-water flow model MODFLOW is the most widely used and accepted
   model of its type in the world today. Several modeling runs were
   completed with MODFLOW for relatively simple hydrogeologic conditions to
   evaluate the accuracy of the strongly implicit procedure (SIP), slice
   successive overrelaxation (SSOR) and preconditioned conjugate-gradient 2
   (PCG2) methods for matrix solution. A series of simulations was
   performed with the SIP, SSOR, and PCG2 methods while adjusting the
   matrix solution parameters sequentially one at a time. A wide range of
   converged solutions was generated for identical input data. The
   simulation results show that MODFLOW will produce accurate results for
   the specific conditions simulated with PCG2, or with SIP if the proper
   combination of SIP matrix solution parameters is chosen by the user.
   Accurate results could not be obtained with SSOR for any of the
   combinations of matrix solution parameters used in this investigation.
   The simulation results confirm that model convergence for a small head
   change convergence criterion is not a good indicator of accurate results
   unless water balance error also is small.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model for evaluating mass leaching from contaminated soil
   or soil stabilized waste is presented. The model is based on mass
   transport due to advection, dispersion, and retardation and can be used
   to evaluate the suitability and/or efficiency of soil washing solutions
   based on the results of column leaching studies. The model differs from
   more traditional models for column leaching studies in that the analysis
   is based on the cumulative mass of leachate instead of leachate
   concentration. A cumulative mass basis for leaching eliminates the
   requirement for determination of `'instantaneous'' effluent
   concentrations in the more traditional column leaching approach thereby
   allowing for the collection of relatively large effluent volumes. The
   cumulative masses of three heavy metals-Cd, Pb, and Zn-leached from two
   specimens of soil mixed with fly ash are analyzed with the mass leaching
   model to illustrate application and limitation of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical contamination of ground water is typically associated with
   multicomponent solutions of reactive substances, the mobility of which
   is affected by their reactivity. In predicting geochemical transport, it
   is therefore important that the liquid and solid phase reactions be
   modeled, along with the flow-controlled processes. This demanding task
   is typically carried out on powerful computers. Frequently, however,
   field data are available for a limited number of species, or, a small
   number of species suffices to characterize ground-water quality. In such
   cases it is desirable to be able to model the transport on a widely
   available class of inexpensive computers. We report on the development
   of a 2-D model for the transport of reactive species that runs
   efficiently on PCs. The model follows a modified one-step procedure that
   adopts total (aqueous and adsorbed) concentrations and aqueous
   concentrations of components, and accounts for aqueous complexation and
   for competitive sorption via isotherms or selectivity coefficients. The
   use of principal directions of transport coordinates, dimensional
   splitting, and a specialized algorithm for handling advection-dominated
   transport render it compact and efficient. Mass conservation is
   satisfied with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse models using, for example, nonlinear least-squares regression,
   provide capabilities that help modelers take full advantage of the
   insight available from ground-water models. However, lack of information
   about the requirements and benefits of inverse models is an obstacle to

   problem to illustrate the requirements and benefits of the nonlinear
   least-squares regression method of inverse modeling and discusses how
   these attributes apply to field problems. The benefits of inverse
   modeling include: (1) expedited determination of best fit parameter
   values; (2) quantification of the (a) quality of calibration, (b) data
   shortcomings and needs, and (c) confidence limits on parameter estimates
   and predictions; and (3) identification of issues that are easily
   overlooked during nonautomated calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Four dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs)-bromoform, chlorobenzene,
   tetrachloroethylene, and trichloroethylene-were used to investigate the
   influence of viscous, gravitational, and capillary forces on DNAPL
   saturation in a natural aquifer sand. The relative magnitudes of these
   forces are expressed in terms of two dimensionless groups, the Capillary
   Number (N-Ca), defined as the ratio of the viscous force to capillary
   force, and the Bond Number (N-Bo), defined as the ratio of the
   gravitational force to capillary force.
   Nondimensionalization of the equations governing two-phase flow suggests
   that DNAPL saturation should be a function of a linear combination of
   the Capillary and Bond Numbers (N-Ca/k(IV) - N-Bo), provided the
   permeability to water (k(IV)) in the presence of discontinuous DNAPL is
   considered. Experimental studies in which DNAPL saturations were
   measured over a range of Capillary and Bond Numbers for upward,
   horizontal, and downward displacement of DNAPL by water corroborate the
   results of the nondimensionlization. DNAPL saturations generally
   decreased with increasing Capillary Number and with decreasing Bond
   Number until N-Ca/k(IV) - N-Bo was greater than approximately 1 x
   10(-5), at which point residual saturation was attained. For the DNAPLs
   used in this study, with adhesion tensions on the order of 26 dynes/cm
   and Bond Numbers ranging from 1.3 x 10(-7) to 2.4 x 10(-6), residual
   saturation was attained at Capillary Numbers greater than approximately
   5 x 10(-5). These results provide a means of estimating the system
   conditions under which the DNAPLs studied achieve residual saturation in
   aquifer material.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to predict the transport of dissolved gases in the presence
   of small amounts of trapped gas in an otherwise water-saturated porous
   medium is needed for a variety of applications. However, an existing
   model based on equilibrium partitioning of dissolved gas between aqueous
   and trapped gas phases does not accurately predict the shape of
   experimentally observed breakthrough and elution curves in column
   experiments. The objective of this study was to develop and test a
   kinetic model for dissolved gas transport that combines the
   advection-dispersion equation with diffusion controlled mass transfer of
   dissolved gas between the aqueous and trapped gas phases. The model
   assumes one-dimensional, steady-state ground-water flow, a single
   dissolved gas component, and a stationary trapped gas phase with
   constant volume. The model contains three independent parameters: the
   Peclet number, P, retardation factor, R, and dimensionless mass transfer
   parameter, omega. The model accurately described the shape of
   breakthrough and elution curves for dissolved oxygen in column
   experiments performed with a poorly graded sand and varying amount and
   composition of trapped gas. Estimated values of P for the bromide tracer
   increased from 5.92 to 174, corresponding to a decrease in dispersivity
   from 5.02 to 0.17 cm, as the trapped gas volume increased from ii to
   30\% of the pore space. It is speculated that this effect is due to a
   narrower pore size distribution (and hence more uniform pore scale
   velocity distribution) caused by trapped gas bubbles selectively
   occupying the largest pores. Estimated values of R increased from 1 to
   13.6 as the trapped gas volume increased and confirmed earlier
   observations that even small amounts of trapped gas can significantly
   reduce rates of dissolved oxygen transport. Estimated values of omega
   ranged from 0.3 to 12.1. Although it was not possible to independently
   measure mass transfer coefficients or interfacial areas, values computed
   from flowrates and estimated omega values are consistent with values
   computed by assuming (1) that interfacial area is proportional to
   trapped gas volume, (2) that trapped gas bubbles are spheres with
   diameters the same size as soil particles, and (3) that mass transfer is
   limited by diffusion of dissolved oxygen through water films surrounding
   trapped gas bubbles.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of soil and ground water due to spills of light nonaqueous
   phase liquids (LNAPL or simply oil) is a widespread environmental
   problem. This paper describes the development and testing of a
   semianalytical model that may be used to design LNAPL containment and
   recovery systems at spill sites. The objective of this study was to
   derive an enhanced semianalytical algorithm for calculating recovery and
   trapping of free phase oil. The enhancements were derived and evaluated
   by comparison with an established numerical model that describes
   transient flow of oil and water. The semianalytical model employs an
   analytical solution for steady-state drawdown in an unconfined aquifer
   due to water pumping. When pumping rates are sufficient to contain the
   separate phase plume, the model calculates recoverable and residual oil
   volumes based on the initial free oil distribution. Refinements were
   implemented to calculate the water-table drawdown and the maximum
   unsaturated zone residual saturation (So,) as functions of soil type.
   Also the influence of hysteresis on the oil-water capillary fringe was
   incorporated into the calculation of oil trapping below a rising
   oil-water interface. A method was derived to reduce saturated zone
   trapping to account for oil recovery that occurs while pumping proceeds.
   The above enhancements yielded close agreement between the
   semianalytical model and the transient model predictions of recoverable
   oil and residual oil in the unsaturated and saturated zones. The models
   were compared for hypothetical gasoline spills in a sandy and a silt
   loam soil, using a range of pumping rates and regional water-table
   fluctuations. Field data from a pipeline leak were evaluated by the
   semianalytical model for hypothetical scenarios involving oil recovery
   from three wells and a falling regional water table. Results suggest
   that the semianalytical model captures many of the trends of transient
   oil recovery. Recovery is less accurately predicted when irregular
   water-table fluctuations occur.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrographs of stream discharge were analyzed to determine ground-water
   recharge for two small basins draining into Mirror Lake, New Hampshire.
   Two methods of hydrograph analysis developed for determining
   ground-water recharge were evaluated, the instantaneous recharge method
   and the constant recharge method. For the instantaneous recharge method,
   recharge is assumed to be instantaneous and uniform over the basin. For
   the constant recharge method, recharge is assumed to be constant and
   uniform over the basin for a period of weeks to months. Both methods
   require that a ground-water recession slope be determined. The recession
   slope is used directly in the calculation for the instantaneous recharge
   method, and it is used as a base of reference for fitting a type curve
   in the constant recharge method. Results of the study indicated that the
   estimates of ground-water recharge for both methods agree to within
   about 10 percent. Two approaches to the instantaneous recharge method,
   manual and automated, were also evaluated, and the results were
   statistically similar.
   The baseflow component of streamflow commonly is assumed to be
   equivalent to ground-water recharge; therefore, two methods developed
   for determining the baseflow component of streamflow, graphical
   partitioning and digital filtering, were evaluated also. Baseflow values
   determined by graphical partitioning of hydrographs were about 25
   percent less than the ground-water recharge values. Baseflow values
   determined by two different approaches to the mathematical digital
   filtering method were generally less than baseflow determined by
   graphical partitioning. However, one of the approaches to digital
   filtering agreed reasonably well with graphical partitioning if an
   appropriate filter constant was used. The other approach to digital
   filtering resulted in baseflow values that were much less than the other
   baseflow values and was therefore deemed inappropriate for use on these
   small mountain watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to evaluate the
   feasibility of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-xylene, and o-xylene
   (BTEX) biodegradation under denitrifying conditions. Nine different
   sources of inocula, including contaminated and uncontaminated soil cores
   from four different sites and activated sludge, were used to establish
   microcosms. BTEX was not degraded under denitrifying conditions in
   microcosms inoculated with aquifer material from Rocky Point and
   Traverse City. However, rapid depletion of glucose under denitrifying
   conditions was observed in microcosms containing Rocky Point aquifer
   material. TEX degradation was observed in microcosms containing Rocky
   Point aquifer material. TEX degradation was observed in microcosms
   containing aquifer material from Fort Bragg and Sleeping Bear Dunes and
   sewage sludge. Benzene was recalcitrant in all microcosms tested. The
   degradation of o-xylene ceased after toluene, ethylbenzene, and m-xylene
   were depleted in the Fort Bragg and sludge microcosms, but o-xylene
   continued to degrade in microcosms with contaminated Sleeping Bear Dunes
   soil. The most probable number (MPN) of denitrifiers in these nine
   different inocula were measured using a microtiter technique. There was
   no correlation between the MPN of denitrifiers and the TEX degradation
   rate under denitrifying conditions. Experimental results indicate that
   the degradation sequence and TEX degradation rate under denitrifying
   conditions may differ among sites. Results also indicate that
   denitrification alone may not be a suitable bioremediation technology
   for gasoline-contaminated aquifers because of the inability of
   denitrifiers to degrade benzene.}},

Abstract = {{Superpositioned analytic functions are used to efficiently and
   accurately model ground-water flow fields containing thin barriers such
   as slurry walls and sheet-pile walls. Barriers are modeled as a series
   of straight-line segments strung together to create irregularly shaped
   open or closed boundaries with zero thickness. The complex analytic
   functions employed provide perfect continuity of flow across the
   boundary while approximating normal flux boundary conditions along the
   boundary. Along an impermeable boundary the normal flux is specified as
   zero, and along a resistant (leaky) barrier the normal flux is
   proportional to a specified resistance parameter and the potential
   difference across the boundary. solution of a given flow problem
   requires solving a system of equations with one equation per boundary
   corner. These equations are linear for impermeable boundaries and for
   resistant boundaries in confined aquifers or single-strata unconfined
   aquifers. In other cases, the boundary condition equations associated
   with resistant barriers can be nonlinear and a new technique for
   iterative solution is employed. Implementation of these techniques in a
   computer program is tested and it is demonstrated by modeling various
   configurations of flow funneled into a gap between two barriers.}},

Abstract = {{Bedding-plane partings, particularly those enlarged by stress relief,
   tend to provide principal ground-water flow pathways which are often
   overlooked, In order to identify them, the use of a proper conceptual
   model of the bedrock aquifer system and appropriate methods of
   hydrogeologic characterization are necessary, Several pervasive bedding
   partings were identified at a study site located within a dipping
   sequence of mudstone and shales, typical of the Passaic Formation in the
   Newark Basin of New Jersey, These bedding fractures constitute the
   discrete aquifer units of a multiunit, leaky bedrock aquifer system, One
   such unit of exceptional transmissivity (the `'Raritan unit'') was
   identified and selected for a detailed characterization. Results of
   three short-duration pumping tests verified the continuity and
   relatively uniform transmissivity of the Raritan unit over distances
   exceeding 1,500 feet, Significant hydrochemical differences between the
   various aquifer units at this 100-acre site were found to be consistent
   with the multiunit structure of the bedrock aquifer system, A similar
   pattern can be observed in regional hydrochemical data recently
   published by others, The principal finding, that a few bedding fractures
   dominate ground-water flow at many sites in the region, has a major
   implication on hydrogeologic characterization requirements for the water
   supply, well-head protection, and aquifer remediation projects in the
   Newark Basin and similar areas of sedimentary bedrock.}},

Abstract = {{The Passaic Formation consists of gradational sequences of mudstone,
   siltstone, and sandstone, and is a principal aquifer in central New
   Jersey, Ground-water flow is primarily controlled by fractures
   interspersed throughout these sedimentary rocks and characterizing these
   fractures in terms of type, orientation, spatial distribution,
   frequency, and transmissivity is fundamental towards understanding local
   fluid-transport processes, To obtain this information, a comprehensive
   suite of geophysical logs was collected in 10 wells roughly 46 m in
   depth and located within a.05 km(2) area in Hopewell Township, New
   Jersey, A seemingly complex, heterogeneous network of fractures
   identified with an acoustic televiewer was statistically reduced to two
   principal subsets corresponding to two distinct fracture types: (1)
   bedding-plane partings and (2) high-angle fractures, Bedding-plane
   partings are the most numerous and have an average strike of N84 degrees
   W and dip of 20 degrees N, The high-angle fractures are oriented
   subparallel to these features, with an average strike of N79 degrees E
   and dip of 71 degrees S, making the two fracture types roughly
   orthogonal, Their intersections form linear features that also retain
   this approximately east-west strike, Inspection of fluid temperature and
   conductance logs in conjunction with flowmeter measurements obtained
   during pumping allows the transmissive fractures to be distinguished
   from the general fracture population, These results show that, within
   the resolution capabilities of the logging tools, approximately 51 (or
   18 percent) of the 280 total fractures are water producing, The
   bedding-plane partings exhibit transmissivities that average roughly 5
   m(2)/day and that generally diminish in magnitude and frequency with
   depth, The high-angle fractures have average transmissivities that are
   about half those of the bedding-plane partings and show no apparent
   dependence upon depth, The geophysical logging results allow us to infer
   a distinct hydrogeologic structure within this aquifer that is defined
   by fracture type and orientation, Fluid flow near the surface! is
   controlled primarily by the highly transmissive, subhorizontal
   bedding-plane partings, As depth increases, the high-angle fractures
   apparently become more dominant hydrologically.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical models that simulate common monitoring well sampling
   demonstrate the distortions that vertical concentration averaging causes
   during the mapping and modeling of an idealized, three-dimensional
   contaminant plume emanating from a simple source of constant solute
   concentration, The apparent extent of the plume, mapped using
   simulations of a regular grid of screened monitoring wells, ranged from
   a worst case of 0\% of the original plume area for long screens (4 m) in
   a low-permeability formation to 90\% for short screens (1 m) in a
   high-permeability formation. When well design and purging procedure were
   inconsistent among wells, the mapped plume exhibited spurious
   directional skewing, bifurcation, zones of low concentration,
   intermittent sources, or multiple sources. Although the study plume was
   not retarded, calibrating a transport model to the monitoring well data
   resulted in retardation factors of up to 23. If first-order decay was
   assumed, the apparent decay constant was found to be as much as 1.8 x
   10(-7) sec(-1) (T-1/2 = 45 days), Apparent retardation or decay was
   inconsistent from well to well, depending on the saturated screen
   length, the degree of screen desaturation during purging, and the
   distance from the source. The study indicates that the quantitative
   assessment of contaminant distributions and transport processes requires
   discrete vertical sampling in the common situation where concentrations
   vary sharply with depth, even in the most ideal hydrogeologic
   environment. If screened monitoring wells are used, screen lengths and
   placements should be appropriate to the contamination situation being
   assessed and inherent biases must be considered. Even so, vertical
   concentration averaging biases and the resulting inconsistencies can
   result in highly misleading evaluations of ground-water contamination
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{The earliest quantitative chemical analysis of ground water from the
   United States was probably made during 1807. The largest number of early
   analyses were of water from various mineral springs in and near the
   towns of Ballston and Saratoga Springs, New York. Although most of the
   scientific and economic interest at the time centered on the reported
   health benefits from the water, some of the earliest reports describing
   the springs contained rudimentary yet scientifically based
   hydrogeochemical explanations for the dissolved constitutents in the
   water. One motivation for the early analytical work was the desire to
   concoct a dry mixture of chemicals that would duplicate the mineral
   water when mixed with ordinary drinking water. The use of a powder would
   simplify distribution and bypass dealing with owners of the springs.
   Early analyses of water from Congress Spring published by different
   individuals between 1817 and 1856 are similar, and if allowance is made
   for minor temporal changes in quality, the results would be considered
   useful even by modern standards.}},

Abstract = {{It has generally been recognized that molecular diffusion can be a
   significant process affecting the transport of carbon-14 in the
   subsurface when occurring either from a permeable aquifer into a
   confining layer or from a fracture into a rock matrix. An analytical
   solution that is valid for steady-state radionuclide transport through
   fractured rock is shown to be applicable to many multilayered aquifer
   systems. By plotting the ratio of the rate of difusion to the rate of
   decay of carbon-14 over the length scales representative of several
   common hydrogeologic settings, it is demonstrated that diffusion of
   carbon-14 should often be not only a significant process, but a dominant
   one relative to decay. An age-correction formula is developed and
   applied to the Bangkok Basin of Thailand, where a mean carbon-14-based
   age of 21,000 gears was adjusted to 11,000 years to account for
   diffusion. This formula and its graphical representation should prove
   useful for many studies, for they can be used first to estimate the
   potential role of diffusion and then to make a simple first-order age
   correction if necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The expanded Durov diagram has been widely used to represent the
   dissolved constituents of natural water and to show plausible
   hydrochemical processes occurring within the hydrological systems,
   Because of the time required to calculate Durov diagram coordinates and
   to plot the points, especially when dealing with large numbers of
   chemical analyses, the treatment of such data is often quite a tedious
   process, To alleviate this problem, DurovPlot program is designed to
   help users in calculating and plotting the diagram in a very short time,
   The program is written in BASIC as a special menu-driven hydrochemical
   data analyses code, It was compiled using Microsoft QuickBASIC version
   4.5 compiler, The utilization of this program requires the acquisition
   of an IBM-PC or compatible with at least 512K bytes of memory, one disk
   drive (at least 360K bytes), a graphic card (EGA or VGA), and at least
   DOS version 5.0, DurovPlot possesses several advantages such as the ease
   with which the data can be entered, edited, and retrieved. The results
   of computation and plotting are obtained in seconds, depending on the
   amount of data analyzed and the speed of the computer processor.}},

Abstract = {{U.S. Geological Survey modular ground-water flow model (MODFLOW) allows
   column to row anisotropy to vary only in different layers. Modifications
   to the code were made to allow each grid block in the model to have its
   own anisotropy, and still retain backward compatibility with the
   original formulation. Memory usage increases because of the need to
   allocate storage for every grid block in the model versus a single entry
   for each layer. The example shown requires about 30 percent more memory
   for the spatially variable versus original anisotropy formulations.
   Storing anisotropy for each grid block is the same as specifying both
   column and row components of hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{6-11}},

Abstract = {{The precise determination of total organic carbon (TOC) in aquifer
   materials is important in the estimation of retardation coefficients for
   organic compound transport. Commonly used methods for TOC determination
   after carbonate removal by acidification include: weight loss on
   ignition of solids at 550 degrees C, acid-dichromate oxidation, and
   combustion at 800-950 degrees C. Since carbonate carbon frequently is
   more abundant than organic carbon ail TOC methods depend on efficient
   and complete carbonate removal prior to the TOC quantification step. A
   method for the determination of TO C in aquifer solids involving
   carbonate removal by 0.73 M sulfurous acid and subsequent combustion at
   800 degrees C was tested on solids from three aquifers and on mineral
   standards, The carbon quantification by combustion and infrared
   defection of CO2 was accurate at solid organic carbon contents between
   30 and 10,000 mu gC/g. The acid treatment added small amounts of carbon
   to the sample, and siderite removal was incomplete, For samples without
   siderite or dolomite, the accuracy of TOC determinations was enhanced by
   grinding the solids, Measurement of very low TOC contents (50-100 mu
   gC/g) requires supplementary testing of grinding and acid treatment
   effects.}},

   2,4-dinitrotoluene to (CO2)-C-14 within 28 days under aerobic
   conditions. Approximately 20\% of added 2,4-dinitrotoluene remained
   undegraded at the end of the incubation while approximately 22\% and 6\%
   were transformed to 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene and 2-amino-4-nitrotoluene,
   respectively. In aquifer microcosms containing 2,6-dinitrotoluene,
   approxinately 67\% of the substrate remained undegraded and
   approximately 14\% was transformed to 2-amino-6-nitrotoluene. The
   radiolabeled study indicated that about 8\% of the 2,6-dinotrotoluene
   was mineralized to CO2. The demonstrated degradation and subsequent
   mineralization of dinitrotoluene compounds by aquifer microorganisms are
   consistent with the decline in dissolved dinitrotoluene concentrations
   observed along the general ground-water flowpath Pt the site. The
   results indicate that intrinsic bioremediation may be a viable
   alternative for remediating contaminated ground water at this site.}},

Abstract = {{A linear response model based on daily spring discharges has been
   applied in simulating the response of the karstic aquifer feeding the
   Arteta spring in Navarra (Spain), which is used for the water supply of
   the city of Pamptona. The model is derived from the eigenvalue solution
   of the ground-water flow partial differential equation, a method that
   provides a continuously in time solution of this equation for
   finite-difference or finite-element space discretization. The modeling
   approach explains the recession curves composed by several decreasing
   exponentials observed in many karstic aquifers and differs from the
   classic assumption where the recession coefficients of these
   exponentials are identified with different flow regimes in conduit
   zones. Recharge-discharge transfer has been simulated using a limited
   number of parameters without having to resort to methods where the
   impulse-response function of the system is obtained by deconvolution.}},

Abstract = {{The concepts of two-way coordinates and one-way coordinates are used to
   describe the different characteristics of two key aquifer parameters,
   transmissivity and storativity, under constant-rate pumping conditions.
   A two-way coordinate is such that the conditions at a given location are
   influenced by changes in conditions on either side of that location; a
   one-way coordinate is such that the conditions at a given location are
   influenced by changes in conditions on only one side of that location.
   Results from sensitivity analysis indicate that storativity has the
   characteristics of two-way coordinates, but transmissivity has the
   characteristics of one-way coordinates, i.e., its information can be
   transferred mainly from upstream to downstream. An upstream observation
   well can produce information on storativity both upstream and
   downstream, but it can produce little information on transmissivity
   downstream.
   These characteristics of the aquifer parameters have important
   implications on pumping-test designs and interpretation. For example, to
   estimate the parameters of an anomalous zone in an aquifer, an
   observation well should be located downstream but near the zone. It
   should not be placed upstream if the parameters downstream are to be
   estimated. An observation well which can provide adequate information
   for estimating storativity may not provide adequate information for
   estimating transmissivity, and vice versa. The aquifer area represented
   by estimated storativity may be different from that represented by
   estimated transmissivity.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport simulation using numerical models is an important and
   widespread tool for evaluation of clean-up strategies as well as for
   prediction of future transport. Classical simulation algorithms for
   advective-dispersive transport usually introduce large numerical errors
   where concentrations are lowest. In general, numerical errors tend to
   spread (disperse) the solute more than physical processes alone. For
   simulations where the Peclet number (Re) is greater than about 2,
   numerical dispersion can be very significant and could lead to erroneous
   conclusions. Recent numerical techniques for simulating advective
   transport minimize numerical errors and provide much better solutions.
   One such technique, Flux-Corrected Transport (FCT), can preserve sharp
   concentration fronts by virtually eliminating numerical dispersion. In
   general, it has been observed that as more detailed knowledge of
   subsurface flow fields is obtained, smaller dispersivity values are
   needed to match observed and simulated data. However, for many numerical
   codes the use of small dispersivities is not practical, because it
   requires fine grids to keep the grid Peclet number limited. A general
   purpose transport code, PMFCT-2D, has been developed, including a fast
   and efficient FCT algorithm, to simulate advective-dispersive transport
   in variably saturated, heterogeneous porous media, with nonuniform
   aquifer thickness in the third dimension. PMFCT-2D can be used to
   accurately simulate high Peclet number transport, including purely
   advective transport (Pe = infinity), resulting from transient or
   steady-state flow conditions. The code is easily coupled to any flow
   simulator via generated velocity, saturation, and cell thickness fields.}},

Abstract = {{A six year field experiment has shown that a sand-bentonite mixture used
   to seal monitoring wells in aquitards contributes solutes to the ground
   water sampled from these wells. Monitoring wells were installed at field
   sites with hydraulic conductivity (K) ranging from 5 x 10(-9) m/s to 3 x
   10(-11) m/s. In most cases the boreholes remained dry during
   installation which allowed the placement of a dry powdered
   bentonite/sand mixture tagged with potassium bromide (KBr) to seal and
   separate sampling points. Over six years, wells were sampled
   periodically and ground-water samples were analyzed for Br and Cl and
   other major ions. Typical Br results ranged from 10 mg/l to 35 mg/l in
   the first 700 days, as compared to an estimated initial concentration in
   the seal material of about 75 mg/l. After six years the bromide
   concentrations had decreased to between 3 mg/l and 5 mg/l. The total
   mass of Br removed in six years is less than 50\% of that placed;
   therefore the contamination effects, although considerably diminished,
   persist. The trends of Br, Cl, Na, and SO4 indicate that varying degrees
   of contamination occur. These data show that the materials used to seal
   monitoring wells in aquitards can have a significant and long-lasting
   impact on the chemistry of the water in the wells.}},

Abstract = {{The eidothermometric method consists of the visualization (from the
   Greek word `'eidos'' = image) of the time evolution of thermometry in a
   water column, by reconstruction of the various isotherms. The image thus
   obtained, where basal thermometry is subject to influences of different
   kinds, will show such disturbances through thermometric anomalies.
   The main advantage offered by this method is to obtain, even at those
   wells with no previous information, reliable and useful data on the
   aquifer permeability, the occurrence of preferential discharge levels or
   impervious levels, and water circulation dynamics.
   The use of said method, moreover, proved to be fully satisfactory both
   when used in relation to short-term thermal influences caused by tides
   and when used in relation to long-term influences caused by sea
   conditions. Similar to eidothermometry, eidosalinometry also provided
   useful information not usually obtained by normal saline logs.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface brines in the Sichuan Basin occur within sedimentary rocks
   ranging in age from Sinian to Cretaceous, especially within rocks of

   are derived from waters of different origin. Water in brines from Upper
   Cretaceous elastic reservoirs in Anren, and from basin margin aquifers
   of Lower Jurassic, Triassic, and Cambrian age are modern meteoric in
   origin. Salinity in these brines is from dissolution of salt-bearing
   formations. Lower Jurassic and Upper Triassic elastic aquifers contain a
   mixture of meteoric water and brines from older rocks based on isotopic
   data. Brines in Middle and Lower Triassic carbonate aquifers originated
   from sea water and are residual brines left after evaporite
   precipitation. Brines from the Upper Sinian carbonate aquifer in Weiyuan
   originated from sea water mixed with magmatic waters.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive ground-water flow modeling may be simplified by application
   of superposition when the governing equations are linear. The
   simplification allows evaluation of impacts of individual aquifer
   stresses and minimized model input, output, and interpretation, Modeling
   is performed by using (1) boundary conditions and aquifer properties
   provided by previous calibrations or analytical techniques, (2) setting
   the initial potentiometric surface and prescribed-head boundaries to an
   arbitrary horizontal datum, and (3) simulating a specific recharge or
   discharge stress.
   Superposition was applied to an existing, calibrated model of the Snake
   River Plain aquifer to simplify prediction of changes in interaction
   with the Snake River, Simulations predict the temporal relationships
   between ground-water use at multiple locations within the Snake River
   Plain and surface-water depletion in four hydraulically connected
   reaches of the Snake River. Simulated aquifer water use at a location
   approximately five miles from a hydraulically connected river reach
   results in river depletions greater than 80\% of the pumping rate after
   10 years. Water use further than 50 miles from hydraulically connected
   river reaches results in depletions from 10 to 30\% of the annual
   average pumping rate after 100 years, Results present spatial and
   temporal impacts of water uses on the Plain that are conceptually and
   quantitatively beneficial to water resources planners and water users.}},

   and precipitated species are chosen as the principal dependent

   discretized. The resulting system of equations is solved using the
   Newton-Raphson method and the Jacobian matrix is computed analytically.
   This method is computationally more efficient than sequential iteration
   methods due to its faster convergence rate. It is also computationally
   more efficient than other direct substitution methods which compute the

Abstract = {{The incorporation of auxiliary data into ground-water flow parameter
   estimation is a challenging task which can ultimately result in a better
   site characterization. In this study a maximum likelihood estimation
   procedure has been applied to the joint identification of the parameters
   of the aquifer transmissivity random field, and the parameters of the
   linear regression between the logarithm of transmissivity and the
   logarithm of the electrical transverse formation factor (TF), determined
   from surface geoelectrical methods (Vertical Electrical Sounding or
   V.E.S.). This approach is basically a co-kriging technique applied to
   the transmissivity and transverse formation factor random fields, but it
   avoids the independent estimation of the cross-covariances and the
   secondary variable covariance. The procedure needs some direct well data
   for transmissivity and a (usually larger) number of V.E.S. measurements
   which have to be in part at a distance from the well locations in order
   to provide useful information. The algorithm determines the
   characteristics of the local (site dependent) transmissivity-transverse
   formation factor relationship and utilizes this auxiliary information
   for a geostatistical transmissivity field estimation. The methodology is
   tested on a real field scenario: a fractured aquifer impacted by
   landfill leachate contamination. The use of the formation factor in
   place of the raw resistivity of the subsoil layers accounts for possible
   effects of clay and contaminant concentration on pore-water resistivity.
   The information provided by the V.E.S. can add, to some extent, to the
   understanding of the aquifer characteristics and vulnerability. However,
   tbe specificity of each site has to be fully understood for an effective
   application of the present procedure. It seems unlikely that geoelectric
   data can differentiate between transmissivity values differing by less
   than two or three orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Many piezometers/wells produce at such low rates and frequency that
   their impact on local hydraulics is negligible, e.g. monitoring
   piezometers or homeowner wells installed in highly permeable soils.
   Defining a deterministic capture zone for such wells is often of limited
   utility as the capture zone is effectively a single flow line directed
   upgradient. In order to provide more insight into the capture zone of
   such wells, a statistically based capture zone, termed a `'percentile
   capture contour'' (PCC), is introduced and analyzed. The capture zone is
   defined by quantifying, for a given travel time, the variation of the
   length and orientation of the flow line emanating upgradient from the
   well. Capture zone variation herein depends on second-order stationary
   random hydraulic conductivity fields and is calculated using Monte Carlo
   analysis.
   Monte Carlo analysis yielded increases in mean travel distances as the
   variance and/or Integral scale in log K increased, but decreases as the
   angle between the principal direction of the correlation structure and
   the regional flow increased. The average travel distance exceeded the
   travel distance estimated by a homogeneous solution using the geometric
   mean hydraulic conductivity. Transverse variation depended both on the
   variance and integral scale of log K, but was insensitive to the
   orientation of the principal correlation direction. The mean orientation
   of the flow path varied with the principal direction of the correlation
   structure, deviating up to 20 degrees from the orientation of the
   hydraulic gradient. These observations are consistent with flow
   following preferential pathways and indicate that significant
   uncertainty exists for source prediction of water feeding passive wells.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical simulation study of air sparging for the removal of
   nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) from the subsurface is presented. These
   simulations were performed using the T2VOC integrated finite-difference,
   multiphase-Bow, contaminant transport code. The code is used to model
   two-dimensional air sparging experiments from Ji et al. (1993) which
   include both homogeneous and heterogeneous permeability distributions.
   The model predicts the experimental gas plume shape and behavior very
   well. Field-scale simulations using a radially symmetric, cylindrical
   mesh are then used to model hypothetical DNAPL and LNAPL spills and air
   sparging remediation performance in various hydrogeologic settings. Both
   homogeneous and heterogeneous systems are considered. The results of the
   study indicate that the sparging-induced gas pressure increase, or
   `'positive pressure,'' measured at steady state below the water table,
   closely corresponds to both the subsurface gas distribution and the
   effective zone of contaminant reduction. Because this positive pressure
   is easily measured in the field with a simple monitoring device, it can
   be used to realistically define the sparging radius of influence.}},

Title = {{A framework for assessing risk reduction due to DNAPL mass removal from
   low-permeability soils}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{111-123}},

Abstract = {{Many emerging remediation technologies are designed to remove
   contaminant mass from source zones at DNAPL sites in response to
   regulatory requirements, There is often concern in the regulated
   community as to whether mass removal actually reduces risk, or whether
   the small risk reductions achieved warrant the large costs incurred.
   This paper sets out a proposed framework for quantifying the degree to
   which risk is reduced as mass is removed from DNAPL source areas in
   shallow, saturated, low-permeability media. Risk is defined in terms of
   meeting an alternate concentration limit (ACL) at a compliance well in
   an aquifer underlying the source zone, The ACL is back-calculated from a
   carcinogenic health-risk characterization at a downgradient water-supply
   well, Source-zone mass-removal efficiencies are heavily dependent on the
   distribution of mass between media (fractures, matrix) and phase
   (aqueous, sorbed, NAPL). Due to the uncertainties in currently available
   technology performance data, the scope of the paper is limited to
   developing a framework for generic technologies rather than making
   specific risk-reduction calculations for individual technologies.
   Despite the qualitative nature of the exercise, results imply that very
   high total mass-removal efficiencies are required to achieve significant
   long-term risk reduction with technology applications of finite
   duration. This paper is not an argument for no action at contaminated
   sites, Rather, it provides support for the conclusions of Cherry et al.
   (1992) that the primary goal of current remediation should be short-term
   risk reduction through containment, with the aim to pass on to future
   generations site conditions that are well-suited to the future
   applications of emerging technologies with improved mass-removal
   capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{The relative contributions of organic carbon and mineral matter to
   trichloroethene (TCE) sorption were determined for a natural, clay-rich
   till from Sarnia, Ont. using laboratory batch tests. Linear TCE sorption
   coefficients of the two till samples (approximataely 12 to 15 m depth)
   were 64.2 l/kg and 151 l/kg and the organic carbon contents (f(oc)) were
   0.68\% and 1.95\%, respectively. To ascertain the importance of sorption
   to mineral matter versus organic carbon, till samples were treated by
   baking. The f(oc) was reduced by 44 to 90\% in treated samples compared
   to natural samples. TCE sorption coefficients were also reduced to 0.48
   to 4.64 l/kg in treated samples. Surface area measurements suggested
   that treating the till samples appeared to have little effect on the
   mineral matter. The results indicated that TCE sorption is dominated by
   the naturally occurring organic carbon. The organic carbon normalized
   sorption coefficients (K-oc) for the natural (untreated) samples were 16
   to 500 times greater than those typically reported for sediment and soil
   samples, indicating the more lipophilic character of the organic matter
   in the till. K-oc estimates which accounted for the oxidation state of
   the organic carbon in the till assuming the carbon is primarily from
   Devonian-age shale fragments resulted in values close to (within a
   factor of 2 to 5) these observed. Thus, both tbe nature and amount of
   organic carbon in the till play major roles in controlling the magnitude
   of TCE sorption in this clay-rich deposit.}},

Abstract = {{A case study of a leaky fluvioglacial aquifer concentrates on methods of
   estimating the zonated log(10)-transmissivities of a regional-scale
   ground-water model covering 450 km(2). Mainly three estimation methods
   are discussed: (a) kriging based on local measurements and predictions,
   (b) hydrologic inversion (i.e., nonlinear regression) based on head
   data, and (c) hydrologic inversion based on head data and on prior
   estimates from kriging. (a) Due to the shortage of data which is usual
   in heterogeneous aquifers, the present study questions the practical
   value of forming zonal kriging estimates from local data whenever
   estimates are to be used as an input to ground-water models. In some
   parts of the homogeneous aquifers local data are sufficient to make such
   estimates. (b) In this study zonal hydrogeological parameters can be
   estimated by inversion based on head data. However, inaccuracies in head
   data may seriously damage the reliability of estimated parameters and,
   as a consequence, the ground-water model. (c) Using zonal kriging
   estimates as prior information in the regression reduces the width of
   the confidence intervals of the parameters with prior information by up
   to 75\%. The study indicates, however, that using prior information in
   the estimation of the hydrologic model parameters only minimally reduces
   the uncertainty of the predicted hydraulic heads.
   For this specific case, the results suggest that in order to
   parameterize and identify the parameters of the ground-water model one
   should concentrate on qualitative mapping of the hydrogeology, on
   sampling accurate head data and on subsequent estimation of the zonal

Abstract = {{Monitoring the movement of contaminants throughout tbe vadose zone
   requires the use of wells and the credibility of a monitoring program
   depends on obtaining an adequate seal between the well casing and
   borehole wall, The credibility of monitoring well installation was
   evaluated during the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory's Large Scale
   Pumping and Infiltration Test. Wells were drilled in and around a 6.5
   acre infiltration basin with an air rotary rig using a downhole hammer,
   cased with PVC or steel, and the annular space back-filled with
   alternating layers of bentonite and sand. The purpose of completing the
   wells in this manner was to isolate fractured intervals (subvertical and
   subhorizontal interflow zones) in order to observe water movement during
   the infiltration test, Bentonite was used between sand intervals to
   prevent the borehole (or annular space) from serving as a conduit for
   vertical water flow or tracer migration. Neutron probes were used to
   confirm the presence and locations of each completion interval (sand or
   bentonite) by distinguishing differences in background-water content of
   the back-filling materials. Upon flooding of the infiltration basin with
   water containing radioactive tracers, water flow and tracer transport
   were monitored using neutron probes and an in situ, downhole gamma
   spectroscopy system, respectively. Results confirm that each well was
   installed correctly; water and tracers flowed through natural fractures
   in the subsurface and arrived at the monitoring sites located at sand
   completion zones. Significant water or tracer flow through the annular
   space between the well casing and borehole was not observed.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Differentiation between natural and anthropogenic sources of
   ground-water contamination by petroleum hydrocarbons is necessary in
   areas where natural hydrocarbons may be present in the subsurface.
   Because of the similarity in composition between natural and refined
   petroleum, the use of statistical techniques to discern trends is
   required. In this study, both multivariate plotting techniques and
   principal component analysis were used to investigate the origin of
   hydrocarbons from a variety of study sites. Ground-water and gas samples
   were collected from the Niagara Falls area and from three gasoline
   stations where leaking underground storage tanks had been found.
   Although soil gas surveys are used to indicate the presence of
   hydrocarbons, they were not useful in differentiating between natural
   and anthropogenic sources of contamination in ground water. Propane and
   pentene were found to be the most useful chemical parameters in
   discriminating between the natural and anthropogenic sources. These
   chemicals are not usually measured in investigations of ground-water
   contamination, yet analysis can be conducted by most environmental
   laboratories using conventional methods.}},

Abstract = {{For meeting the growing demand on ground water in hard rock areas of
   India, man-made percolation tanks have become important structures for
   augmenting ground-water recharge. Keeping in view their increasing
   number and cost involved in their construction and their temporal
   variation in percolation due to silting or desilting operations if
   undertaken, it is vital to develop proper methodology to evaluate the
   performance of these structures. A method employing the mass balance of
   environmental chloride in the tank has been developed for this purpose.
   The results obtained using this method at one experimental site indicate
   that an average of 30-35\% of impounded water is recharged through this
   structure situated in granitic gneissic terrain of a semiarid region of
   India. The remainder is lost through evaporation. The method developed
   is simple, inexpensive, and sensitive enough to observe the temporal
   variation in the recharge rate through such tanks.}},

Title = {{Ambiguity in measuring matrix diffusion with single-well
   injection/recovery tracer tests}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{166-176}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Single-well injection/recovery tracer tests are considered for use in
   characterizing and quantifying matrix diffusion in dual-porosity
   aquifers. Numerical modeling indicates that neither regional drift in
   homogeneous aquifers, nor heterogeneity in aquifers having no regional
   drift, nor hydrodynamic dispersion significantly affects these tests.
   However, when drift is coupled simultaneously with heterogeneity, they
   can have significant confounding effects on tracer return. This
   synergistic effect of drift and heterogeneity may help explain
   irreversible flow and inconsistent results sometimes encountered in
   previous single-well injection/recovery tracer tests. Numerical results
   indicate that in a hypothetical single-well injection/recovery tracer
   test designed to demonstrate and measure dual-porosity characteristics
   in a fractured dolomite, the simultaneous effects of drift and
   heterogeneity sometimes yields responses similar to those anticipated in
   a homogeneous dual-porosity formation. In these cases, tracer recovery
   could provide a false indication of the occurrence of matrix diffusion.
   Shortening the shut-in period between injection and recovery periods may
   make the test less sensitive to drift. Using multiple tracers having
   different diffusion characteristics, multiple tests having different
   pumping schedules, and testing the formation at more than one location
   would decrease the ambiguity in the interpretation of test data.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant mobility in unsaturated soil will impact the effectiveness
   and efficiency of using these compounds for in situ environmental
   remediation above the water table. For this reason, transient
   unsaturated column tests were used to study the influence of boundary
   conditions and soil attributes on anionic surfactant transport. In these
   tests, aqueous surfactant solutions were injected into the inlet of
   horizontally mounted soil columns. Two commercial anionic surfactants
   were used, an alkyl ether sulfate (AES) and a linear alkylbenzene
   sulfonate (LAS).
   The overall study was divided into two parts. First, boundary condition
   effects including injected surfactant solution concentration, initial
   moisture content, and surfactant application rate were investigated.
   Increasing the injection solution concentration increased anionic
   surfactant mobility in the column while changes in the initial soil
   moisture content and surfactant application rate had no significant
   impact. Second, the impacts of soil attributes such as texture, dominant
   exchangeable cation, and resident organic matter were measured. With
   respect to texture, mobility was found to be greater in a sandy soil as
   compared with two loamy soils. Both surfactants, especially LAS, were
   found to be more mobile in a Na+ dominated soil rather than one
   dominated by Ca+2. The absence of soil organic matter increased LAS
   mobility.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrogeochemical study in the clay-soil mantled portion of a karst
   terrane in southern Indiana demonstrated preferential flow of soil water
   through macropore structures that are of higher permeability than the
   soil matrix. Variable transport of several inorganic ions, such as Cl-,
   SO4=, Na+, Ca++, and Mg++, through the unsaturated zone was observed
   immediately after a major storm event in April, 1992. A KBr salt spray
   experiment during the storm led to recovery of bromide, a nonreactive,
   conservative ion, at a depth of 10 ft within 24 hours after the storm.
   The observed Br- transport rate (5 in/hr) is approximately six times
   greater than the expected rate of transport in the absence of
   preferential flow. Temporal changes in cation to anion ratios
   demonstrated that anions are more mobile due to the process of anionic
   exclusion which drives more anions out of the clay matrix whereas
   cations are attenuated by adsorption an the clay particles due to their
   charge differences. In the absence of storm-water infiltration, the ion
   transport proceeds largely by matrix flow of soil water.
   The storm event also initiated considerable mixing of ground water
   through lateral flow within the aquifer. The ions, such as Cl-, NO3-,
   Ca++, and Mg++, showed immediate dilution by storm water. Subsequently,
   ion concentrations in the aquifer increased to the initial level because
   of reequilibration with soil matrix water released from the lower part
   of the unsaturated zone.}},

Abstract = {{Many state agencies are currently (1995) developing wellhead protection
   programs. The thrust of some of these programs is to protect water
   supplies by determining the areas contributing recharge to water-supply
   wells and by specifying regulations to minimize the opportunity for
   contamination of the recharge water by activities at the land surface.
   The area contributing recharge to a discharging well is the surface area
   at the water table through which the water flowing to the well entered
   the ground-water system. In the analyses of ground-water flow systems,
   steady-state average conditions are commonly used to simplify the
   problem and make a solution tractable. However, recharge is usually
   cyclic in nature, with seasonal cycles and longer term climatic cycles.
   The effect of these cyclic stresses on the area contributing recharge to
   wells is quantitatively analyzed for a hypothetical alluvial valley
   aquifer system that is representative of a large class of ground-water
   systems that are extensively developed for water supply. The analysis
   shows that, in many cases, these cyclic changes in the recharge rates do
   not significantly affect the location and size of the areas contributing
   recharge to wells. The ratio of the mean travel time to the length of
   the cyclic stress period appears to be an indicator of whether the
   transient effects of the cyclic stress must be explicitly represented in
   the analysis of contributing areas to wells. For the cases examined, if
   the ratio of the mean travel time to the period of the cyclic stress was
   much greater than one, then the transient area contributing recharge to
   wells was similar to the area calculated using an average steady-state
   condition. However, cyclic stresses on systems with ratios less than one
   do have an effect on the location and size of the areas contributing
   recharge to wells.}},

Abstract = {{Industrial waste water has been injected into a permeable part of the
   Upper Miocene injection reservoirs near Geismar, Louisiana since 1971.
   The injection zone is a series of alternating extremely permeable sands
   and impermeable clays, hydraulically isolated from the surficial aquifer
   system by a thick layer of clay, which acts as a confining layer. The
   study area encompasses four industrial facilities and 12 active
   injection wells. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate
   injection-well design and potential for movement of injected waste water
   within the hydrogeologic system. Numerical modeling was conducted in
   both cylindrical coordinates and Cartesian coordinates. A convection
   cell developed around a single prototype injection well in
   cylindrical-coordinate system with a buoyant injection rising to form a
   lens within the injection zone. Around an ideal, fully penetrating well
   cased into the injection sand and open from a depth of 5,056 feet to
   5,456 feet, simulations show the injectant moves upward to a depth of
   4,866 feet, forms a lens about 400 feet thick, and spreads radially
   outward to a distance of 1,670 feet after 10 years. Comparison
   simulations of injection through wells having open depth intervals of
   5,056 to 5,256 feet and 5,256 to 5,456 feet demonstrate that such
   changes in well design have little effect on the areal spread of the
   injectant lens or the rate of upward movement. Multiple injection well
   simulations in Cartesian coordinates indicate that about 5, 10, and 80
   percent of the study area would be underlain by injected waste water
   after 10, 20, and 100 years of injection, respectively. Outward movement
   of waste water proceeds even after injection stops. The rate of outward
   movement under the post-operational period (after injection ceases) is
   much smaller than under the operational period (injection period).}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear regression is useful in ground-water flow parameter
   estimation, but problems of parameter insensitivity and correlation
   often exist given commonly available hydraulic-head and head-dependent
   flow (for example, stream and lake gain or loss) observations. To
   address this problem, advective-transport observations are added to the
   ground-water flow, parameter-estimation model MODFLOWP using
   particle-tracking methods. The resulting model is used to investigate
   the importance of advective-transport observations relative to
   head-dependent now observations when either or both are used in
   conjunction with hydraulic-head observations in a simulation of the
   sewage-discharge plume at Otis Air Force Base, Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
   USA. The analysis procedure for evaluating the probable effect of new
   observations on the regression results consists of two steps: (1)
   parameter sensitivities and correlations calculated at initial parameter
   values are used to assess the model parameterization and expected
   relative contributions of different types of observations to the
   regression; and (2) optimal parameter values are estimated by nonlinear
   regression and evaluated. In the Cape Cod parameter-estimation model,
   advective-transport observations did not significantly increase the
   overall parameter sensitivity; however: (1) inclusion of
   advective-transport observations decreased parameter correlation enough
   for more unique parameter values to be estimated by the regression; (2)
   realistic uncertainties in advective-transport observations had a small
   effect on parameter estimates relative to the precision with which the
   parameters were estimated; and (3) the regression results and
   sensitivity analysis provided insight into the dynamics of the
   ground-water flow system, especially the importance of accurate boundary
   conditions. In this work, advective-transport observations improved the
   calibration of the model and the estimation of ground-water flow
   parameters, and use of regression and related techniques produced
   significant insight into the physical system.}},

Abstract = {{In volcanic areas, when two conditions are satisfied, there is a linear
   correlation between the range of negative self-potential (SP) anomalies

   condition is a high ratio between the resistivity of the unsaturated
   zone, and the resistivities of the substratum and the water-saturated
   zone. The second condition is the homogeneity of the unsaturated zone.
   From this relation, we develop the concept of a geophysical surface (SPS
   surface) calculated from SP and topographic data. Under these
   conditions, the SPS surface is both an equipotential SP surface and the
   interface between the unsaturated zone and the saturated medium below.
   Borehole logs for three field sites show that drainage courses and

Abstract = {{The Var Valley (Southern France) is a typical setting in which alluvial
   water is situated ina fore land area. The alluvial aquifer is recharged
   by seepage from the intake area of the river Var and by subsurface
   infiltration from its fore land area.
   Chemical and isotopic tracing of both sources is well contrasted, in
   accordance with the very different geology and relief in the two places.
   O-18, silica, and sulphate contents were chosen to calculate percentages
   of recharge from the Var river and the embanking Pliocene pudding
   stones. Differences among recharge estimates, calculated from the three
   tracers are low, about 10\%. Ground-water areas where component
   contributions to recharge are maximum (over 70\% for Var inflow and over
   40\% for pudding stone inflow) are considered feeding areas. Discharge
   of leakage from pudding stones was calculated by the use of the Hantush
   formula on the whole surface of these areas: 0.53 +/- 0.2 m(3)/sec,
   which corresponds to 1/5 of the total water budget of the alluvial
   aquifer.
   Chemical surveying of alluvial water, during a water year, displays the
   constancy of ground-water inflows over time, ranging from those when
   inflow surface water is nonexistent in the river Var during low-water
   periods to those when it is massive in spate.
   Thus, during periods without influence from the river Var, the inflows
   from the embanking formation sustain discharge of alluvial water and
   influence its chemical makeup. Taking these results into account, the
   protection area of the lower river Var water resource must be enlarged
   to include a part of the intake area of the adjacent reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{It is not uncommon that hydraulic conductivity data are sparse in an
   area, and that information about subsurface sediment distributions are
   even more sparse or of pear quality. It is therefore desirable to have
   rational ways to estimate conductivity distributions for ground-wafer
   flow modeling. Interpretations of the geologic history of a
   fault-bounded sedimentary basin in south Santa Clara County, California,
   were used to estimate variations in sediment distribution and resulting
   relative hydraulic conductivities. Spatial sediment distributions were
   interpreted from the dominant infilling processes, using standard
   sedimentary facies models for alluvial fans and fluvial deposition.
   These sedimentary facies were categorized into interpreted hydrogeologic
   facies, which were then compared with measured hydraulic conductivity
   data obtained from scattered aquifer pumping tests in the basin. The
   comparison suggests that sedimentary facies models can provide a good
   basis for estimating the distribution of relative hydraulic
   conductivity. Further, the comparison provides a procedure for
   estimating hydraulic conductivities in areas where no measured values
   are available. This procedure provides a better basis for estimating
   hydraulic conductivities than methods which do not consider sedimentary
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to regional hydrological balance where
   the number and integrated discharge of springs are used to estimate
   recharge. This technique is applied to Spain, where approximately
   two-thirds of the country has an inventory of spring lithology and
   discharge (17,000 springs). The data are used to extrapolate results to
   the entire region and are compared to independent methods of estimating
   recharge. This is an informative use of commonly available information
   and it could be applied to other regions with a similar data base.
   From this sample, a distribution of the spring flow volume contribution
   in Spain is estimated (a) according to flow spring discharge, (b) as a
   limit of a lognormal distribution, which in our sample is simplified in
   a potential formula a(x) = 24,101.x(-0.91). In this way it is calculated
   that the total flow volume of the springs is 14,877 hm(3)/yr. The study
   does not take into account seepage (diffuse discharge) draining to seas,
   rivers, or lakes but only water at the spring source. The most permeable
   lithological groups considered are the source of 94.2\% of the total
   flow supplied by the springs. Limestone is especially significant,
   contributing 66.2\%. The net recharge of precipitation to ground water
   varies widely according to lithologies. It reaches to 20.3\% in
   limestones and drops to less than 1\% for quartzites, slates, and
   plutonic rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental assessment, ground-water management, and aquifer
   remediation designs rely on comprehension of the hydraulic parameters of
   aquifers. Because of the heterogeneity of most aquifers, a number of
   pumping tests are commonly required to provide a reasonable hydraulic
   parameter distribution. Data for 11 pumping tests, conducted at the
   Carson County well field, Amarillo, Texas in the 1950s to 1970s were
   analyzed by the Theis solution and the Cooper and Jacob solution to
   provide information for optimal ground-water management. The unconfined
   aquifer at the well field consists of sands, sandstone, gravels, and
   clay. A delayed gravity response was observed in the drawdown curves
   from pumping tests conducted in the unconfined aquifer. Because the
   Theis solution and the Cooper acid Jacob solution do not take this
   delayed response, or other unsaturated effect into account, these two
   solutions may overestimate hydraulic conductivity of an unconfined
   aquifer. Therefore, the Neuman solution which considers the delayed
   gravity response was used to estimate Phe hydraulic parameters using the
   software AQTESOLV (by Geraghty \& Miller, Inc., 1990). This paper
   presents the results of a study of the unconfined aquifer at Carson
   County well field, Amarillo, Texas. The analysis shows that the results
   obtained by the Neuman method are more reasonable than those obtained by
   the Theis solution and the Cooper and Jacob solution. According to
   results from the Neuman solution, the hydraulic conductivity of the
   unconfined aquifer of Carson County well field varies from 2.55 to 5.97
   X 10(-5) m/s (weighted average hydraulic conductivity is 4.13 X 10(-5)
   m/s), The small difference of the estimated hydraulic conductivity
   between wells shows that the unconfined aquifer under Carson County well
   field is relatively uniform. The effects of infinitesimal borehole
   assumption, accuracy of individual parameters, skin effects, and spatial
   distribution of hydraulic conductivity are discussed as well. It is also
   shown that benefits from obtaining accurate results should be weighted
   against budget requirements.}},

Abstract = {{The first paper in this series (Rautman and Istok, 1996) presented a
   geostatistical framework for obtaining a probabilistic assessment of
   ground-water contamination. This paper presents the results of a case
   study that applies this framework to define the spatial extent and
   severity of nitrate and Dacthal (dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate or
   DCPA, a herbicide) contamination in the unsaturated and saturated zones
   for a 150 km(2) site near Ontario, Oregon. Sediment samples collected
   from 35 boreholes were used to compute vertical accumulations of nitrate
   and DCPA in the unsaturated zone. Measured nitrate and DCPA
   concentrations in ground-water samples collected from 42 wells were used
   to compute vertical accumulations of nitrate and DCPA in the saturated
   zone. Sample variograms were fit with nugget and spherical models to
   describe the pattern of spatial continuity of nitrate and DCPA
   concentrations and accumulations. Conditional, sequential Gaussian
   simulation was used to generate 100 simulations for each variable on a
   0.5 X 0.5 km grid. Probabilistic summaries of these simulations were
   used to develop (a) maps showing the probability of contamination
   exceeding specified theshold values, (b) probability distributions for
   contaminant accumulation and concentration at unsampled locations, (c)
   probabilistic descriptions for the location of contaminant-plume
   boundaries, and (d) probability distributions for the total contaminated
   area and tot al contaminant mass. The results demonstrate that
   interpretations of site characterization data to determine the extent
   and magnitude of contamination at a site will vary depending upon the
   level of uncertainty that will be tolerated by the decision maker. This
   case study also illustrates the potential applicability and utility of
   the probabilistic approach for the interpretation of site
   characterization data and the design of future data collection
   activities.}},

Abstract = {{A series of ground-water flow and tracer experiments were performed on
   an undisturbed column of fractured clay-rich till, 0.5 m diameter by 0.5
   m long, in a pressure-controlled cell. The measured hydraulic
   conductivity of the sample was 1.0 to 1.2 X 10(-6) m/sec and the average
   hydraulic gradient during the tracer experiments ranged from 0.45 to
   0.49. The experiments clearly show that ground-water flow and
   contaminant migration through the sample is primarily controlled by
   fractures and root holes. Tracer experiments using a solute (chloride),
   colloid-sized bacteriophage (PRD-1 and MS-2) and uncharged latex
   microspheres, indicated very fast transport rates of 4 to 360 m/day.
   These rates are similar to fracture flow velocities calculated on the
   basis of the measured bulk hydraulic conductivity of the column, and
   measured fracture spacing, using the cubic law for flow through
   parallel-walled fractures. Fracture aperture values calculated from the
   ground-water flow data (35 to 56 mu m) are of the same magnitude as
   values calculated from the breakthrough of tracers (13 to 120 mu m).
   Aperture values calculated for fractures (1 to 94 mu m) and root holes
   (2 to 188 mu m), on the basis of measured immiscible creosote entry
   pressures, are also comparable with these values. The injected creosote,
   a DNAPL, penetrated most of the visible and a few invisible fractures
   and root holes, indicating that, for this till, fractures and root holes
   are important conduits for the transport of DNAPL's.}},

Abstract = {{For a one year period, conductivity and temperature were measured in
   extraction wells situated in two coastal aquifers in the South of Spain.
   Sensors were placed 3 m below water level. Spatial distributions of

   of the marine intrusion. They also permitted analysis of the salt-water
   movement during the entry and recession of the marine intrusion. The
   integration of the condutivity distribution improved the aquifer
   analysis.
   In the studied area, the marine intrusion corresponded to a thermal
   effect.
   Temporal distributions of the parameter, derivated from the temperature,
   advanced the development of the salt-water intrusion by two weeks.
   An effective short-term prediction can be accomplished through analysis
   of the relationship between the temp oral sequence of the conductivity

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1082-1089}},

Abstract = {{Ground-water withdrawal from a confined or semiconfined aquifer causes
   three-dimensional deformation in the pumped aquifer and in adjacent
   layers (overlying and underlying aquifers and aquitards). In response to
   the deformation, hydraulic head in the adjacent layers could rise or
   fall almost immediately after the start of pumping. This
   deformation-induced effect is analyzed by a linear poroelasticity model
   using properties typical of unconsolidated sedimentary materials. Model
   simulations suggest that an adjacent layer undergoes horizontal
   compression and vertical extension when pumping begins. Hydraulic head
   initially drops in a region near the well and close to the pumped
   aquifer, but rises outside this region, Magnitude of head change varies
   from a few centimeters to more than 10 centimeters. Factors that
   influence the development of deformation-induced effects includes matrix
   rigidity (shear modulus), the arrangement of aquifer and aquitards,
   their thicknesses, and proximity to land surface. Induced rise in
   hydraulic head is prominent in an aquitard that extends from land
   surface to a shallow pumped aquifer. Induced drop in hydraulic head is
   likely observed close to the well In an aquifer that is separated from
   the pumped aquifer by a relatively thin aquitard. Induced effects might
   last for hours in an aquifer, but could persist for many days in an
   aquitard. Induced effects are eventually dissipated by fluid flow from
   regions of higher head to regions of lower head, and by propagation of
   drawdown from the pumped aquifer into adjacent layers.}},

Abstract = {{The results of an extended analysis of the chloride breakthrough curves
   (BTCs) obtained from transport experiments on undisturbed soil monoliths
   previously reported by Sassner et al. (1994) are discussed. Parameter
   values for different forms of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE)
   were obtained by curve-fitting using the nonlinear least-squares
   optimization code CXTFIT developed by Parker and van Genuchten (1984).
   Good fits to the experimental BTCs from the individual soil monoliths
   were obtained for three different forms of the ADE, allowing for anion
   exclusion, immobile water, and both of these processes, respectively.
   Although the more complex forms of the ADE possess more flexibility to
   provide a slightly more refined fit to the individual breakthrough
   curves, larger uncertainty is associated with the fitted parameter
   values. Due to the limited amount of information manifested in the BTCs
   it is not possible on the basis of this information to distinguish which
   of the models is physically more meaningful. Furthermore, when more
   parameters are included in the optimization procedure, the resulting
   values are more uncertain. The same ADE models were also fitted with
   equally good results to a hypothetical large-scale BTC derived by
   flux-averaging the responses from the individual monoliths. However,
   regardless of the form of the ADE used, the resulting parameter values
   for the large-scale transport (i.e., not only the dispersivity value
   that is expected to increase) were inconsistent with the corresponding
   parameter values obtained for the individual BTCs. This supports
   previous indications that ADE models may not be accurate for predicting
   large-scale transport: in heterogeneous soil systems corresponding to
   e.g. the scale of an agricultural field or a grid element In a numerical
   catchment model because model parameters are not determinable from
   independent measurements on a scale corresponding to a practical
   manageable core size or to standard intrumentation.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed vertical sampling is useful in aquifers where vertical mixing
   is limited and steep vertical gradients in chemical concentrations are
   expected. Samples can be collected at closely spaced vertical intervals
   from nested wells with short screened intervals. However, this approach
   may not be appropriate in all situations. An easy-to-construct and
   easy-to-install multiport sampling well to collect ground-water samples
   from closely spaced vertical intervals was developed and tested. The
   multiport sampling well was designed to sample ground water from
   surficial sand-and-gravel aquifers. The device consists of multiple
   stainless-steel tubes within a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) protective
   casing. The tubes protrude through the wall of the PVC casing at the
   desired sampling depths. A peristaltic pump is used to collect
   ground-water samples from the sampling ports. The difference in
   hydraulic head between any two sampling ports can be measured with a
   vacuum pump and a modified manometer. The usefulness and versatility of
   this multiport well design was demonstrated at an agricultural research
   site near Princeton, Minnesota where sampling ports were installed to a
   maximum depth of about 12 m below land surface. Tracer experiments were
   conducted using potassium bromide to document the degree between
   sampling ports. Samples were successfully collected for analysis of
   major cations and anions, nutrients, selected herbicides, isotopes,
   dissolved,eases, and chlorofluorcarbon concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Four hundred ground-water sampling points were used to delineate a plume
   in an unconfined sand aquifer at a 44 year old septic system servicing a
   school in Ontario, Canada. A bromide tracer test indicated a residence
   time of one to two weeks for sewage effluent in the 1.6 meter
   unsaturated zone beneath the tile bed. This is sufficient time for the
   oxidation of all nitrogen to nitrate to be complete and for the content
   of dissolved organic carbon to decrease from about 19 mg/l in the septic
   tank to about 1 mg/l at the water table. The 15 m wide plume core
   emanates more than 110 meters downgradient of the tile bed, has
   detectable dissolved oxygen, high nitrate (20-120 mg/l as N), chloride
   (42-209 mg/l), sodium (34-101 mg/l), calcium (120-249 mg/l), and above
   background sulphate, and potassium. Ground-water flow velocity at this
   site is rapid (100 m/yr); thus the mapped extent of the plume (110 m)
   represents about one year effluent loading. Phosphate (PO43-)
   concentrations at the water table (similar to 1-2 mg/l as P) appear to
   have reached steady state at values significantly lower than that of the
   effluent (9 mg/l as P). Steady-state concentrations suggest that mineral
   precipitation reactions control attenuation in the unsaturated zone. A
   comparison of phosphate sorbed (74 mg/kg) and total P in the soil (1000
   mg/kg) suggests that precipitation is a more important process in the
   unsaturated zone than is sorption. PO43- levels in the plume, however,
   remain elevated(0.3-1.8 mg/l as P) relative to background levels in
   ground water (<0.01 mg/l as P) up to 75 meters away from the tile bed.
   This migration distance of PO43- in ground water is greater than that
   observed at other younger septic system sites. The extent of the plume
   at this site suggests that long-term PO43- migration in the ground-water
   zone may be controlled by adsorption processes that allow slow but
   progressive advancement of PO43-.}},

Abstract = {{Shallow low-to-moderate temperature geothermal waters are found in the
   upper part of the Napa Valley near the town of Calistoga, California.
   The geology of the upper Napa Valley is dominated by Jurassic to
   Cretaceous eugosynclinal Franciscan assemblage and the late Tertiary
   (Pliocene) Sonoma Volcanic rocks. Minor post-Pliocene normal faulting is
   evident in the volcanic rocks north and southeast of the study area. The
   thermal waters which have a sodium chloride chemistry with elevated
   concentrations of chloride, boron, and fluoride, are attributed to
   fault-controlled hydrothermal circulation. The cold waters are
   characterized as mixed-cation bicarbonate type with high concentrations
   of calcium, magnesium, and iron. The geothermal aquifer is believed to
   be recharged by the upwelling of thermal water along a linear fault zone
   aligned with the topographic axis of the Napa Valley. Data from 140
   domestic water wells were used to evaluate the chemical character of the
   geothermal resource and to construct maps of chloride and boron
   concentrations. These maps were subsequently used to locate the source
   of the deep thermal water and zones of cold and hot water mixing, and to
   develop a conceptual model of the geothermal system.}},

Abstract = {{At the Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) site in
   southwestern Ohio, sand and gravel lenses within till provide potential
   pathways for the flow of contamination into the underlying aquifer.
   These high-permeability lenses account for 22\% of the volume of the
   till, have a complex arrangement, and are smaller in scale than the
   site. Even the relatively dense subsurface sampling program at the FEMP
   site is not adequate to determine facies interconnections with
   certainty. To delineate probable facies boundaries, a binary indicator
   random variable was used to represent the presence of high or
   low-permeability sediment. The 800 available lithologic logs that
   penetrate the till were coded with the binary system at 2 ft (0.6 m)
   intervals yielding 15,829 observations. These data were used to compute
   the declustered mean of indicator values in horizontal intervals, giving
   an estimate of the proportion of high-permeability sediment in each
   vertical zone. The areal correlation in specific zones was examined
   through indicator variograms, which had pronounced anisotropy.
   Three-dimensional indicator point kriging was used to produce maps of
   the probability of existence of high-permeability sediment. These maps
   were used in a preliminary analysis of sand body interconnectedness.
   Results indicate that portions of sand bodies are interconnected through
   the entire interval studied and that the areal extent of vertical
   interconnection is up to 1000 ft.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{1132-1140}},

Abstract = {{Site selection for ground-water production wells was made easier using a
   microgravity survey technique. The ground-water regime beneath the
   Carleton University campus is dominated by fracture flow associated with
   major faults. These faults are located within buried bedrock valleys
   where preferential erosion of the bedrock has occurred. A series of
   faults is inferred from bedrock topography and hydrogeological testing;
   however, the precise orientation of the faults is to a large extent
   uncertain. The bedrock surface is masked by fluvial, glacial, and
   glaciomarine overburden of variable thickness.
   High precision, small-scale microgravity profiling was carried out to
   identify the bedrock valleys. Gravity anomalies of up to 0.05 mgal
   correspond to valley depths ranging from 5 to 15 meters. The density
   contrast between overburden and limestone bedrock is estimated as 0.3
   g/cm(3). Forward modeling using a polygon technique suggests that the
   observed, corrected gravity profile is a smoothed reflection of the
   bedrock surface at depth.
   Based on the locations of the bedrock valleys, several faults were
   identified and four test wells were drilled as part of the development
   of Phase 2 of the Carleton Groundwater Energy Project. Three of these
   wells produced high yields, exceeding 60 l/sec, when converted to 12
   inch diameter production wells. The fourth well also encountered a
   bedrock valley but with a slightly lower yield of water.
   The favorable drilling results have shown that small-scale microgravity
   profiling, in an area thai is largely unsuitable far the detection of
   subsurface features using other geophysical techniques, is an effective
   method for imaging the bedrock surface, The positions of the faults,
   which are known to exist on the basis of stratigraphy, geophysical well
   log correlations, bedrock topography, and calcite-filled fractures
   exposed in outcrop or core, have been more accurately defined.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},

Abstract = {{A new method is presented to determine the transmissivity and the
   storage coefficient from recovery data measured after a pumping period
   of an aquifer test. Previously available methods can determine the
   storage coefficient during the pumping period only or under restrictive
   conditions. This method requires observations from a minimum of two
   points (e.g., the pumping well and an observation weal. For each time
   during recovery, the drawdowns observed in the two wells are first
   plotted with regard to the distance from the pumping well centrum,
   giving an intercept A and a slope B for each pair of data. The plot of A
   values with regard to time allows to calculate the transmissivity value,
   while the plot of B values versus time gives the storage coefficient
   value. The method is applied to two sets of field data, and the results
   obtained are close to those obtained using the classical methods (Theis
   or Jacob) applied to the drawdown data obtained during the pumping
   period. This method well determines transmissivity and storativity from
   recovery data obtained at short times after the completion of pumping,
   i.e., for times shorter than those which can be used by the Cooper-Jacob
   approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Three sandy subsurface materials and a sandy surface soil (Orangeburg
   Series) from the Upper Coastal Plain, were used to assess the influence
   of mineralogy and surface chemistry on the determination of physical
   transport parameters using ionic tracers, The clay mineralogy of the
   surface soil consisted primarily of kaolinite, hydroxy-interlayered
   vermiculite, and gibbsite, while the dominant clay mineralogy of the
   subsurface materials consisted of kaolinite, goethite, and mica
   (illite), Repacked columns of the four differing strata were leached
   with tritiated (approximate to 200 pCi mL(-1)) Bromide solutions, either
   MgBr2 or KBr, of varying ionic strengths (0.1-0.001 N), Pore-water
   velocities estimated by bulk density and mass flux were consistent with
   those estimated from tritium breakthrough, In contrast, Br- breakthrough
   differed drastically within the four materials and was altered by
   experimental conditions (sample drying, carrier cation, etc.), The
   retardation for 0.001 N KBr varied from 0.94 for the surface soil to
   2.15 for the subsurface materials and increased with increasing Fe oxide
   content, For the subsurface samples, Br- was retarded to a greater
   degree in the presence of Mg2+ compared to K+. In contrast, oven drying
   the sample reduced the degree of Br- retardation observed for the
   subsurface materials, These results indicate that retardation can vary
   dramatically within materials of similar texture, mineralogy, and
   origin. The apparent conservative behavior of an ionic species under a
   given set of conditions (mineralogy, pH, ionic strength, scale size,
   predominant counter ion) does not automatically ensure that transport
   will remain conservative as those conditions are altered by changes in
   experimental design or unforeseen circumstances encountered at the field
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{Pentachlorophenol-acclimated methanogenic consortia were incubated at
   temperatures of 5, 10, 21, and 31 degrees C in physical models of an
   interceptor trench. Four identical 5.4 cm diameter brass columns packed
   with a uniform pea gravel were operated with a 2 day hydraulic retention
   time in a continuous upflow mode. The columns were fed 25 or 50 mg of
   acetate per liter, 0.32 or 4.0 mu M pentachlorophenol, and a dilute
   vitamin and nutrient mixture. In the columns operated at 31 and 21
   degrees C, pentachlorophenol was reductively dechlorinated at the ortho
   positions to form 2,3,4,5-tetrachlorophenol and 3,4,5-trichlorophenol.
   3,4,5-Trichlorophenol was the sole degradation product observed in the
   effluent. The lag period prior to pentachlorophenol biotransformation
   increased with decreasing temperature. At 31 degrees C, a lag of 72
   hours was observed; at 21 degrees C the lag was 120 hours; and at 10
   degrees C the lag was 744 hours. No biodegradation of pentachlorophenol
   was observed at 5 degrees C within an 888 hour period. Conversion of
   pentachlorophenol to 3,4,5-trichlorophenol was complete within the first
   7.6 cm of the column at 31 and 21 degrees C, Loss of 90\% of the
   pentachlorophenol was observed over the 30 cm column at 10 degrees C. An
   interceptor trench inoculated with a temperature- and
   pentachlorophenol-acclimated methanogenic consortia has the potential to
   anaerobically biotransform pentachlorophenol at temperatures as low as
   10 degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) was found to be transformed by microorganisms
   under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 10 degrees C in microcosms
   simulating the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Borden subsurface environment.
   Biotransformation of DBP was observed under aerobic, nitrate-reducing,
   Fe(III)-reducing, and sulfate-reducing conditions. The biotransformation
   of DBP in the microcosms was significantly decreased as the redox
   potential was lowered, especially under sulfate-reducing conditions.
   However, other factors such as nutrient depletion and buildup of toxic
   intermediates could have affected the biotransformation rates. The
   highest DBP biotransformation rate (0.57 mu g DBP.g
   sediment(-1).day(-1)) was observed under aerobic conditions whereas the
   lowest rate (0.05 mu g DBP.g sediment(-1).day(-1)) was under
   sulfate-reducing conditions. Biotransformation of DBP at 10 degrees C
   was significantly enhanced by the addition of 10 mM NaNO3 suggesting
   that both the addition of nitrate and high redox conditions favor its
   biotransformation in subsurface environments.}},

Abstract = {{Approaches to investigate possible recharge during a pumping test period
   are demonstrated by analyzing the pumping test data from the Nottingham
   aquifer, UK. The pumping lasted more than 200 days and the data for
   different observed periods are used to obtain aquifer parameters. If
   recharge is ignored, estimated transmissivities and storativities change
   progressively with the observation time. This indicates that a gradually
   added new source may be involved. Then the observed data in both pumping
   and recovery periods at one of the pumping sites are matched by the data
   calculated from the Theis equation. The match is very good except near
   the end of the recovery period. It shows that the real drawdown
   recovered more quickly than predicted by the model, indicating that the
   aquifer obtained extra recharge from other sources. The match between
   the observation and the model is improved by including a fixed-head
   boundary or leakage in the model. The recharge to the aquifer is
   estimated to be 19\% and 34\% of the pumpage at the end of pumping,
   depending on the method used. The real source of the additional recharge
   is not clear; it could be from the surface water in the unconfined area,
   the storage of the aquitard, the compaction of the aquitard, or a
   combination of the three. This requires further hydrogeological
   investigation.}},

Title = {{Hydrochemical analysis of ground-water flow and saline incursion in the
   Clarendon Basin, Jamaica}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{801-810}},

Abstract = {{The Clarendon Basin of south-central Jamaica has been recognized for its
   productive sugar cane industry since the late 1800s. Much of its success
   is attributed to rich alluvial soils, a year-round tropical climate and
   copious supplies of good quality irrigation water from a karstic
   limestone aquifer of Tertiary age. This aquifer extends throughout the
   northern part of the basin, but ends abruptly at the South Coast Fault,
   an east west feature that forms the northern boundary of a deep graben
   filled with alluvial sediments. These alluvial sediments are the only
   source of water for the area south of the fault (the Vere Plain).
   However, the sediments also lap onto the limestone to the north of the
   fault (the Clarendon Plain) and provide a supplementary ground-water
   source. By the early 1970s nearly 200 wells supplied irrigation water
   for over 20,000 hectares of land. As development increased, the salinity
   of the ground water increased. Consequently, many wells were closed down
   and several sugar plantations were abandoned. In the study presented
   here, major ion (Ca, Mg, Na, K, HCO3, Cl, SO4, and NO3), minor ion (F,
   Br, and I), and environmental isotope (delta(18)O, delta D)
   hydrochemistry is used to resolve the hydrodynamics of ground-water flow
   in the basin and identify the source and mode of emplacement of the
   saline water.
   Oxygen and hydrogen isotope data confirm that while the major well
   production areas are located in lowland coastal areas, recharge
   originates almost exclusively as rainfall in the cooler elevated parts
   of the basin above 750 m (asl). Subsurface conduit flow brings this
   water to the limestone well fields, and any excess water is able to
   cross the South Coast Fault to feed the alluvial aquifer of the Vere
   Plain. The thin alluvial aquifer of the Clarendon Plain also receives
   limestone water but this water does not enter entirely by subsurface
   means. Instead data suggest that while some of the water can be
   attributed to natural upward vertical leakage in the northwest of the
   Clarendon Plain, the remainder can be attributed to the seepage of
   irrigation water drawn, at least in part, from wells developed in the
   underlying limestone.
   Saline ground waters affect all the aquifers of the basin and several
   potential sources have been proposed. Major and minor ion data point to
   a sea-water source, and a sea-water wedge extending beneath the thick
   alluvial aquifer of the Vere Plain is an obvious candidate for the
   source of salinity observed in wells from this aquifer. Closer
   examination of the chemical data reveals, however, that wells in the
   limestone and alluvial aquifers to the north of the South Coast Fault do
   not derive their salinity from this source location, and instead draw
   sea water from the east and west along the relatively permeable South
   Coast Fault zone. This water can move tee limestone wells directly;
   wells in the alluvium of the Clarendon Plain, however, receive most of
   the saline water indirectly via leakage of irrigation water pumped
   initially from the limestone. Sea water drawn along the fault may also
   be the primary source of salinity in the aquifer of the Vere Plain but
   this cannot be confirmed on the basis of hydrochemical evidence alone.}},

Abstract = {{During storm events, the shallow disposal facilities at Oak Ridge
   National Laboratory become inundated, and subsurface stormflow may
   intermittently extract radionuclides from the surrounding soils and the
   wastes themselves, It is estimated that 90\% of the rain water
   infiltrating the soil horizons becomes subsurface stormflow, yet
   stormflow is a poorly understood process, The objectives of this
   research are to model stormflow: (1) to identify important parameters
   for waste site monitoring and data collections; (2) to evaluate
   remediation designs; and (3) to investigate the effect of local
   heterogeneities on stormflow paths, Numerical models of a proposed waste
   disposal site were developed, and a Latin-hypercube simulation technique
   was used to study the uncertainty of model parameters, Sensitivity
   analyses of model parameters suggested that hydraulic conductivity was
   the most influential parameter. However, local heterogeneities may alter
   flow patterns and result in complex recharge and discharge processes.
   Hydraulic conductivity, therefore, may not be used as the only reference
   for subsurface flow monitoring and engineering designs. Neither of two
   engineering designs, capping and French drains, was found to be
   effective in hydrologically Isolating downslope waste trenches. However,
   combinations of both designs may prove more effective than either one
   alone.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Chad, a closed basin]lake, is the only large surface-water body in
   the African Sah el. Future water resource development in the Chad Basin
   requires an understanding of the hydrogeology of the basin. In this
   paper we examine the hydraulic relationship between the lake and the
   phreatic aquifer of the Chad Formation. Electrical resistivity data from
   30 surveys were combined with over 60 open well measurements to
   construct a water-table map of the southwestern quadrant of the lake.
   The map indicates that the Lake Chad water level is at a higher
   hydraulic level than the phreatic aquifer and that the ground-water flow
   is southwest, away from the lake. The average measured seepage rate into
   the phreatic aquifer in the southwestern and southern parts of the lake
   was 7.1 X 10(-3) m/d (median = 1.3 X 10(-3) m/d) which is about 21\% of
   the annual water input to the lake. This measured seepage flux (9.96 X
   10(9) m(3)/yr) can account for about 107\% of the annual solute input to
   the lake. Solute transport model simulations indicate about 32\% (15.3 X
   10(9) m(3)/yr) of the input water and 152\% (2.87 X 10(12) g/yr) of the
   total solute input can be removed by ground-water recharge (seepage)
   from the lake. These results provide an explanation to account for the
   freshness of Lake Chad's water despite its surficial closed basin
   geologic setting: solutes delivered to the lake via surface-water inflow
   leave the lake via ground-water recharge. These results also indicate
   recharge from the lake (similar to 10(10) m(3)/yr) represents an
   enormous amount of water available as a ground-water resource in the
   African Sahel.}},

Abstract = {{The isotopic characteristics of municipal landfill leachate and gases
   (carbon dioxide and methane) are unique relative to the aqueous and
   gaseous media in most other natural geologic environments. The
   delta(13)C of the CO2 in landfills is significantly enriched C-13, with
   values as high as +20 parts per thousand reported, The delta(13)C and
   delta D values of the methane fall within a range of values
   representative of microbial methane produced primarily by the
   acetate-fermentation process. The delta D of landfill leachate is
   strongly enriched in deuterium, by approximately 30 parts per thousand,
   to nearly 60 parts per thousand relative to local average precipitation
   values. This deuterium enrichment is undoubtedly due to the extensive
   production of microbial methane within the limited reservoir of a
   landfill, The concentration of the radiogenic isotopes, C-14 and H-3,
   are significantly elevated in both landfill leachate and methane, The
   C-14 values range between approximately 120 and 170 pMC and can be
   explained by the input of organic material that was affected by the
   increased C-14 content of atmospheric CO2 caused by atmospheric testing
   of nuclear devices, The tritium measured in leachate, however is often
   too high to be explained by previous atmospheric levels and must come
   from material buried within the landfill. The unique isotopic
   characteristics observed in landfill leachates and gases provide a very
   useful technique for confirming whether contamination is from a
   municipal landfill or some other local source.}},

Abstract = {{A theory is developed to describe the geometry of nonwetting or
   nonaqueous phase liquids in moist unsaturated media. This theory
   predicts that liquids with positive values of the classical
   two-dimensional spreading coefficient form pendular rings. Liquids with
   negative values form pendular rings in regions of high-water tension or
   in regions of relatively high concentration of the nonwetting fluid, but
   they form insular lenses in regions of low-water tension or regions of
   low concentration of the nonwetting fluid. A three-dimensional spreading
   coefficient was developed to predict this behavior. Infiltrating water
   can cause transitions by breaking the pendular rings of nonwetting
   liquids in the unsaturated zone, and forming larger insular blobs as
   these rings coalesce. These blobs may drain downward due to gravity.
   These conditions may contribute to the mobility of nonwetting liquids
   due to percolation of water through the unsaturated zone.}},

Title = {{Variations in capture-zone geometry of a partially penetrating pumping
   well in an unconfined aquifer}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{842-852}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Design of effective and efficient pump-and-treat systems requires
   capture zones of recovery wells to closely circumscribe the contaminant
   plume, Overestimation of capture zones incurs the undesired expense of
   treating clean water, Underestimation of capture zones enables
   contaminants to escape downgradient. Recovery wells in unconfined
   aquifers commonly penetrate only part of the aquifer either because of
   its large saturated thickness or the shallow vertical extent of
   contamination. The capture-zone geometry of a partially penetrating
   pumping well can differ greatly from that of a fully penetrating one
   because of vertical flow components near the well. The differences in
   geometry are far greater if the medium is anisotropic (K-h not equal
   K-v).
   To estimate the capture-zone geometry of a partially penetrating pumping
   well, a steady-state, finite-difference model was constructed to
   simulate flow to a well in a regional flow system, The model was used to
   simulate differences in the velocity field created by changes in (1) the
   depth of well penetration, (2) the magnitude of the regional hydraulic
   gradient, and (3) the degree of anisotropy. Following each simulation
   particle tracking was performed to determine the maximum width, depth,
   and distance to the stagnation point of the capture zone, Graphs were
   developed between capture-zone width, relative capture-zone depth,
   distance to the stagnation point, versus the ratio of Q/q (pumping
   rate/specific discharge), The graphs enable estimates to be made of
   these geometric parameters for a variety of pumping rates, regional
   hydraulic gradients, hydraulic conductivities, anisotropy ratios, and
   degrees of partial penetration. The results show that for isotropic
   conditions, particularly for small ratios of Q/q and wells that
   penetrate less than 40 percent of the aquifer, the shape of a capture
   zone can deviate significantly from that of a fully penetrating well.
   For anisotropic conditions, these differences are more pronounced and
   apply to a wider range of Q/q ratios and well penetration depths.
   In sequences of sediment, anisotropy is produced by textural,
   architectural, and stratigraphic elements that occur at different
   scales, Capture zones should be estimated using K-h:K-v ratios
   determined from pumping tests, This assures that the measured degree of
   anisotropy is commensurate with the scale of elements encountered by the
   stress created by a pumping well, Tabulated K-h:K-v ratios from analysis
   of pumping tests in unconfined aquifers suggest there are few isotropic
   sand and gravel aquifers, Recognition of this characteristic and
   consideration of the effects of partial penetration and regional
   hydraulic gradient ran the geometry of capture zones may lead to the
   design of more efficient and effective pump-and-treat systems.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous geochemical data from unconfined sand aquifers beneath two
   operating domestic septic systems are used to illustrate and evaluate a
   conceptual model of septic-system geochemistry, This model emphasizes
   the changing redox and alkalinity conditions in the septic system and
   the subsurface, The septic-tank effluents flow as distinct plumes
   downward through the unsaturated zones and then primarily laterally in
   the ground-water zones, The composition of the effluent was measured at
   several points in each system. At each site, the septic-tank effluent
   underwent aerobic oxidation in the unsaturated zone, which caused
   conversion of NH4+ to NO3-, organic C to CO2 and organic S to SO42-. At
   the first site, calcium carbonate dissolution in the unsaturated zone
   buffered the acidity released by the redox reactions, In contrast, the
   second system was poorly buffered and the pH dropped from 6.7 to 4.9 as
   aerobic oxidation occurred, Below the water table a small amount of
   aerobic oxidation occurred at each site, Nitrate-N concentrations in the
   cores of both plumes were above 25 mg/l as the plumes traveled from the
   septic systems, At the second site, the ground-water plume discharges to
   a river at the edge of the property, As the effluent flowed through the
   organic C-rich sediments of the river bed, NO3- disappeared and
   alkalinity increased, presumably due to denitrification. Differences in
   sediment composition at the two sites also led to different behaviors of
   Fe, Al, and possibly PO43-. The conceptual model offers an organized
   approach to interpreting the major geochemical trends observed in the
   two systems, which are determined mostly by the well-aerated unsaturated
   zones below the drain fields and the amount of buffering material
   present in the sediments.}},

Abstract = {{A geostatistical methodology based on Markov-chain analysis and Bayesian
   statistics was developed for probability estimations of hydrogeological
   and geological properties in the siting process of a nuclear waste
   repository. The probability estimates have practical use in
   decision-making on issues such as siting, investigation programs, and
   construction design. The methodology is nonparametric which makes it
   possible to handle information that does not exhibit standard
   statistical distributions, as is often the case for classified
   information. Data do not need to meet the requirements on additivity and
   normality as with the geostatistical methods based on regionalized
   variable theory, e.g. kriging. The methodology also has a formal way for
   incorporating professional judgments through the use of Bayesian
   statistics, which allows for updating of prior estimates to posterior
   probabilities each time new information becomes available. A Bayesian
   Markov Geostatistical Model (BayMar) software was developed for
   implementation of the methodology in two and three dimensions. This
   paper gives (1) a theoretical description of the Bayesian Markov
   Geostatistical Model; (2) a short description of the BayMar software;
   and (3) an example of application of the model for estimating the
   suitability for repository establishment with respect to the three
   parameters of lithology, hydraulic conductivity, and rock quality
   designation index (RQD) at 400-500 meters below ground surface in an
   area around the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory in southeastern Sweden.}},

Title = {{A generalized approach for the interpretation of geophysical well logs

Abstract = {{Quantitative analysis of geophysical logs in ground-water studies often
   involves at least as broad a range of applications and variation in
   lithology as is typically encountered in petroleum exploration, making
   such logs difficult to calibrate and complicating inversion problem
   formulation, At the same time, data inversion and analysis depend on
   inversion model formulation and refinement, so that log interpretation
   cannot be deferred to a geophysical log specialist unless active
   involvement with interpretation can be maintained by such an expert over
   the lifetime of the project. We propose a generalized log-interpretation
   procedure designed to guide hydrogeologists in the interpretation of
   geophysical logs, and in the integration of log data into ground-water
   models that may be systematically refined and improved in an iterative
   way. The procedure is designed to maximize the effective use of three
   primary contributions from geophysical logs:(1) The continuous depth
   scale of the measurements along the well bore; (2) The in situ
   measurement of lithologic properties and the correlation with hydraulic
   properties of the formations over a finite sample volume; and (3)
   Multiple independent measurements that can potentially be inverted for
   multiple physical or hydraulic properties of interest, The approach is
   formulated in the context of geophysical inversion theory, and is
   designed to be interfaced with surface geophysical soundings and
   conventional hydraulic testing, The step-by-step procedures given in our
   generalized interpretation and inversion technique are based on both
   qualitative analysis designed to assist formulation of the
   interpretation model, and quantitative analysis used to assign numerical
   values to model parameters, The approach bases a decision as to whether
   quantitative inversion is statistically warranted by formulating an
   over-determined inversion, If no such inversion is consistent with the
   inversion model, quantitative inversion is judged not possible with the
   given data set, Additional statistical criteria such as the statistical
   significance of regressions are used to guide the subsequent calibration
   of geophysical data in terms of hydraulic variables in those situations
   where quantitative data inversion is considered appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{Characterizing the extent and severity of ground-water contamination at
   waste sites is expensive and time-consuming. A probabilistic approach,
   based on the acceptance of uncertainty and a finite probability of
   making classification errors (contaminated relative to a regulatory
   threshold vs, uncontaminated), is presented as an alternative to
   traditional site characterization methodology, The approach utilizes
   geostatistical techniques to identify and model the spatial continuity
   of contamination at a site (variography) and to develop alternate
   plausible simulations of contamination fields (conditional simulation).
   Probabilistic summaries of many simulations provide tools for (a)
   estimating the range of plausible contaminant concentrations at
   unsampled locations, (b) identifying the locations of boundaries between
   contaminated and uncontaminated portions of the site and the degree of
   certainty in those locations, and (c) estimating the range of plausible
   values for total contaminant mass. The first paper in the series
   presents the geostatistical framework and illustrates the approach using
   synthetic data for a hypothetical site. The second paper presents an
   application of the proposed methodology to the probabilistic assessment
   of ground-water contamination at a site involving ground-water
   contamination by nitrate and herbicide in a shallow, unconfined alluvial
   aquifer in an agricultural area in eastern Oregon.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of dense nonaqueous phase liquids is one of the principal
   problems associated with current ground-water remediation efforts.
   Standard pump-and-treat methods are ineffective largely because of the
   low aqueous solubilities of DNAPL components. Surfactants can increase
   DNAPL solubility and hence have the potential for increasing the rate of
   DNAPL dissolution in pump-and-treat systems. To test the effectiveness
   of surfactants under field conditions, a controlled field test at
   Canadian Forces Base Borden was undertaken. Results indicate
   surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation can rapidly remove the majority
   of DNAPL using simple modifications of a pump-and-treat system, As in
   all pump-and-treat systems, the efficiency is a function of the
   hydraulic conductivity. The persistence of high DNAPL concentrations at
   specific elevations within the aquifer throughout the test indicates
   that little vertical movement of DNAPL occurred as a result of the
   introduction of the surfactant, Since the test was stopped when small
   amounts of DNAPL still remained, the limit of removal was not
   investigated.}},

Abstract = {{A late-winter cyclone classified as one of the most intense of the 20th
   century moved across the Southeastern states of Georgia and South
   Carolina and onto the Northeast during March 12-14, 1993, Record low
   barometric pressures were recorded in Augusta, Georgia (28.93 inches of
   mercury) and Columbia, South Carolina (28.63 inches of mercury) on March
   13, 1993, and pressures returned to normal values (near 30 inches of
   mercury) within one day following these record lows, This relatively
   unusual event provided an opportunity to examine the attendant
   water-level response in continuously monitored ground-water wells in
   regional Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Blue Ridge aquifers in
   the Southeast, Water levels in all wells examined responded inversely to
   the short duration, extreme drop in barometric pressure, Barometric
   efficiencies (Delta ground-water level/Delta barometric-pressure level)
   calculated were dependent on depth to screened- or open-interval
   midpoint (highest correlation coefficient, r(2) = 0.89) and, to a lesser
   extent, total thickness of confining material above the aquifer tapped
   (highest r(2) = 0.65), Wells in crystalline-rock aquifers had a
   correlation with depth to open-interval midpoint (r(2) = 0.89) similar
   to the sedimentary aquifers examined, The magnitude of barometric
   efficiency was also strongly related to a well's increased distance from
   aquifer outcrop areas in the Cretaceous aquifers in South Carolina (r(2)
   = 0.95) and the upper Brunswick aquifer in Georgia (r(2) = 0.90),
   because these aquifers are more deeply buried toward the coast, This
   relation between barometric efficiency, well depth, and extent of
   confinement suggests that barometric efficiency determinations can
   provide useful information to hydrologists concerned with examining an
   aquifer's degree of confinement and corresponding isolation from land
   surface, particularly when the aquifer is used as a source for public
   supply.}},

Abstract = {{Slug interference testing may be particularly useful for characterizing
   hydraulic properties of aquifer sites where disposal of contaminated
   ground water makes pumping tests undesirable, The design, performance,
   and analysis of slug interference tests for two field test examples are
   presented, Results were compared with standard constant-rate pumping
   tests, The comparison indicates that slug interference tests provide
   estimates comparable to those obtained from short duration pumping tests
   for the determination of transmissivity, storativity, and vertical
   anisotropy.
   The close agreement in hydraulic property values obtained using the two
   test methods suggests that slug interference testing, under favorable
   test conditions (for example, observation well distances less than or
   equal to 30 m), can provide representative aquifer characterization
   results. The quality and extent of test data obtained also indicate the
   potential use of slug interference testing for three-dimensional
   hydrologic characterization investigations, when conducted using
   multilevel monitoring facilities.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical equations are developed to model changes in porosity,
   specific surface area, and permeability caused by biomass accumulation
   in porous media. The proposed equations do not assume any specific
   pattern for microbial growth but instead are based on macroscopic
   estimates of average biomass concentrations. For porous media with a
   pore-size distribution index value (lambda) equal to 3, the macroscopic
   model predictions of porosity, specific surface area, and permeability
   changes are in exact agreement with biofilm-model predictions, At other
   values of lambda between 2 and 5, simulated porosity profiles are
   identical and relative specific surface area and permeability profiles
   show minor deviations, In comparison to biofilm-based models, the
   macroscopic models are relatively simple to implement and are
   computationally more efficient. Simulations of biologically reactive
   flow in a one-dimensional column shaw that the macroscopic and biofilm
   approach based transport codes predict almost identical porosity and
   permeability profiles, The macroscopic models are simple and useful
   tools for estimating changes in various porous media properties during
   bioremediation of contaminated aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{In the Data Quality Objectives (DQO) process, statistical methods are
   used to determine an optimal sampling and analysis plan, When the DQO
   decision rule for instituting remedial actions is based on a critical
   change in water quality, the monitoring program design must ensure that
   this change can be detected and measured with a specified confidence,
   Usually the focus is on the change at a single monitoring location and
   the process is limited to addressing the uncertainty inherent in the
   analytical methods and the variability at that location, However, new
   strategies that permit ranking the waste sites and prioritizing remedial
   activities require the means for assessing overall changes for small
   regions over time, where both spatial and temporal variability exist and
   where the uncertainty associated with these variations far exceeds
   measurement error, Two new methods for assessing these overall changes
   have been developed and are demonstrated by application to a waste
   disposal site in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. These methods incorporate
   historical data where available and allow the user to either test the
   statistical significance of a linear trend or of an annual change
   compared to a baseline year for a group of water quality wells.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative Laplace transform solution for the problem, originally
   solved by Neuman, of constant discharge from a partially penetrating
   well in a water-table aquifer was obtained. The solution differs from
   existing solutions in that it is simpler in form and can be numerically
   inverted without the need for time-consuming numerical integration. The
   derivation involves the use of the Laplace transform and a finite
   Fourier cosine series and avoids the Hankel transform used in prior
   derivations. The solution allows for water in the overlying unsaturated
   zone eo be released either instantaneously in response to a declining
   water table as assumed by Neuman, or gradually as approximated by
   Boulton's convolution integral. Numerical evaluation yields results
   identical with results obtained by previously published methods with the
   advantage, under most well-aquifer configurations, Of much reduced
   computation time.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{605-609}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{For compound mixtures or compounds with two or more differently sorbing
   isomers which are not analytically distinguished, combined sorption
   parameters determined in the laboratory are dependent upon the ratio of
   different compounds or isomers and upon experimental methods and
   conditions. The purpose of this paper is to mathematically examine the
   effects of these factors on sorption parameters calculated from batch
   (shake-flask) and continuous flow column sorption studies of compound or
   isomer mixtures. The analysis in this paper helps explain the apparent
   anomalies between batch and column sorption results in previously
   published studies of Rhodamine WT (RWT). In batch reactors, the
   solid:liquid ratio, Rs, has a major effect on batch sorption results. As
   Rs decreases, partitioning coefficients determined from batch results
   approach those determined from column results, which is contrary to the
   trend that may be anticipated for single component analytes, A single
   column sorption coefficient or retardation factor for multiple
   constituents does not accurately describe the transport of the
   individual compounds, The implications of the effects of experimental
   methods suggest that sorption parameters determined from batch studies
   for compound or isomer mixtures (e.g., BTEX, combined xylenes, and
   others) should be interpreted with care. Significant errors in
   prediction and description of contaminant transport can result if the
   presence of multiple compounds or isomers is not recognized or if batch
   or column data for compound or isomer mixtures are misinterpreted.}},

   identifying boundaries of landfill to be constructed on a real site. The
   neural network, as a simple technique, was found to be able to logically
   predict the variation. The sensitivity of the produced permeability maps
   to both the quality and number of observations was also studied to
   investigate the accuracy of the proposed mapping methodology. The use of

Title = {{Interactive modeling of ground-water vulnerability within a geographic

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{During the last several years, the geographic information system (GIS)
   technology has emerged as an extremely effective tool for analyzing and
   prioritizing natural resource management alternatives. Because natural
   resource management problems are spatial in nature, the GIS technology
   provides a tool for defining the extent of the problem, and facilitates
   the design and implementation of alternative management strategies. The
   flexible design of a GIS coupled with the ability to integrate models
   with spatial data gives resource managers and planners the tools to
   effectively manage natural resources and to assess the implementation of
   regulatory policies before they are implemented.
   This paper describes an interactive modeling system developed within a
   GIS environment to facilitate rapid appraisal of the susceptibility of
   ground water to contamination by pesticides. The interactive system
   combines three widely used screening models with the ARC/INFO GIS
   software and a graphical user interface. Implemented on a color-graphic
   engineering workstation, the interactive modeling system can be used to
   visualize the spatial distribution of model inputs and outputs. The
   advantage of this system is that instead of ad-hoc linkage between GIS
   software and a simulation model, a fully integrated and interactive
   system in which the model equations are programmed within the GIS was
   developed. The impetus for developing the interactive ground-water
   modeling system was the relative lack of tools that fully integrate
   models with GIS and the potential benefits to the resource manager in
   developing such integrated environmental modeling systems. There is an
   increasing demand, from the GIS perspective, for tools that perform
   functions other than organization and display of spatial data. From the
   ground-water modeling perspective, several advantages can be derived
   from fully integrating process-based models with the data management,
   analysis, and display capabilities of the GIS.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for determining steady-state capture zones in
   three dimensions around horizontal drains and vertical wells in
   homogeneous, anisotropic aquifers in a uniform flow field. Equations are
   presented for determining drawdown and velocity vector components in
   three dimensions around drains and wells. Using these equations, a
   second-order Runge-Kutta particle tracking algorithm is applied to trace
   streamlines in three dimensions. By tracking a large number of
   particles, it is possible to determine areas where capture occurs and
   areas where particles escape capture. The resulting 3D capture zones are
   diagrammed as both 2D (section view) plots and 3D plots.}},

Abstract = {{Eight Schlumberger soundings and four Wenner anisotropy measurements
   were conducted in the northwestern section of the Yucatan Peninsula for
   hydrogeological investigations of a karst aquifer. This system is
   influenced by a circular high permeability zone (Ring of Cenotes)
   probably related to the Chicxulub Impact Crater. Schlumberger soundings
   and Wenner anisotropy measurements show that the karst aquifer can be
   modeled as an electrically anisotropic medium. Anisotropy is related to
   preferential permeability directions channeling ground-water flow within
   the aquifer. Directions of maximum permeability were determined using
   Wenner anisotropy measurements. Electrical soundings were conducted at
   different sites near the Ring of Cenotes. Resistivity values decrease
   toward the Ring of Cenotes supporting the hypothesis that selected
   segments of the Ring have high permeability. Several soundings were
   conducted in order to study lateral permeability variations along the
   Ring. A high permeability section can be identified by low resistivity
   models and is related to a zone of high cenote density. A low
   permeability section of the Ring was found showing high resistivity
   models. This zone overlaps with an area of low cenote density.
   Electrical soundings were used to determine the depth of the fresh-water
   lens; the interface was detected along two profiles perpendicular and
   parallel to the Ring of Cenotes resulting in a depth that ranged from 18
   m near the coast up to 110 m in the southeastern part of the study area.
   The predicted depths of the interface using electrical methods showed a
   good correlation with Ghyben-Herzberg and measured interface depths at
   some sites. Discrepancies between calculated and interpreted interface
   depths at two sites may be explained by horizontal-to-vertical
   permeability anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{A nonparametric statistical methodology based on kernel function
   estimation is developed for assessing the probability that a particular
   location in the aquifer has high or low conductivity using borehole
   information. The approach presented is an alternative to indicator
   Kriging, Soils are classified through a binary indicator function
   defined as 0 for low and as 1 for a high conductivity soil. Estimates of
   the probability of occurrence of a high or low conductivity soil are
   made on a three-dimensional grid. Each such estimate is formed as a
   local weighted average of the indicator function values that lie within
   an averaging interval or bandwidth of the point of estimate. A different
   vertical bandwidth is chosen at each borehole log. Horizontal bandwidths
   are selected independently at each horizontal level. These bandwidths
   are chosen by cross validation. Observations closer to the point of
   estimate are weighted higher using a kernel or weight function. Unlike
   Kriging, the underlying stochastic process is not assumed to be
   stationary. An application using data from Lake Bonneville deposits in
   Davis County, Utah is presented.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis was conducted of multidimensional subsurface moisture flow
   in a hypothetical low-level radioactive waste disposal facility, The key
   design feature examined in the analysis was a sloping sand/gravel
   capillary barrier designed to route natural infiltration around a
   concrete vault, Three barrier slopes (1:25, 1:10, and 1:5) and three
   sand/gravel property combinations were considered, The slopes and
   material property combinations were selected to represent a range in
   barrier effectiveness. The porous media flow code used for this analysis
   was VAM3DCG, a three-dimensional, finite-element code which was able to
   use nonorthogonal grid discretizations and employed robust, efficient
   numerical techniques, Three-dimensional modeling demonstrated that flow
   in the hypothetical design exhibited cross-slope flow because of the
   pressure gradient produced in the third, cross-slope dimension, Barrier
   effectiveness was shown to be highly sensitive to the sand/gravel
   material properties, Barrier slope was less important, especially for
   the effective material combinations, The presence of three-dimensional
   flow could be important in a performance assessment if the quantity of
   water predicted to breach the capillary barrier by a tie-dimensional
   model were different from that predicted by a three-dimensional model,
   Comparative modeling demonstrated that a two-dimensional analysis
   resulted in underestimation of barrier effectiveness, For the considered
   design, two-dimensional modeling is a conservative, yet reasonable,
   approach in a performance assessment application.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical procedure based on the MacCormack method was used for the
   simulation of one-dimensional isothermal transient movement of liquid
   phase water in an unsaturated soil including precipitation, evaporation,
   and moisture removal from soil by the roots of transpiring plants. The
   numerical model utilized finite-difference explicit predictor-corrector
   equations and it was applied to a few flow problems. Comparison between
   the numerical results and laboratory or field experimental values was
   very promising. Our predicted values also agreed reasonably well with
   previously published numerical solutions. The proposed procedure was
   found to be easily adapted for solving the nonlinear soil-water flow
   equation. However, it required only a knowledge of soil hydraulic
   conductivity and its water potential or diffusivity as functions of
   moisture content.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical profiles of tritium and nitrate pore-water concentrations were
   determined to similar to 8 m depth across two loess hillslopes. Mean
   recharge fluxes, estimated from chloride mass balance, are 5-10 times
   larger at the mid- and toe-slope positions than at the top-slope; the
   magnitudes of the values compare reasonably with results from other
   methods. The tritium and nitrate profiles exhibit multiple peaks which
   indicate that piston flow is not the sole flow process in this system.
   Results of a simple I-D mixing model suggest that
   infiltration-exfiltration cycles in zones of plant root activity explain
   the shallow tritium peaks. Deeper peaks result from preferential
   vertical and/or lateral flow. The importance of these dispersive
   processes is underlined by great dilution of observed tritium
   concentrations, relative to expected concentrations assuming piston
   flow. In this setting, chloride is useful as a recharge estimator while
   tritium and nitrate serve as tracers of landscape-scale water movement.}},

Abstract = {{The `'pore tree'' model of pore structure was originally developed for
   catalyst and sorbent grains to allow coupled reactions and diffusion
   into and out of nonpermeable porous media in the absence of convection
   through the media. The pore tree model is extended herein to describe
   the permeable pore structure which characterizes the subsurface
   transport of gas and water in soil, the dispersion of contaminants, and
   in situ remediation. The interconnectivity of the pore structure is
   obtained via a statistical determination of the `'branches'' that are
   common to several trees to allow convection and diffusion through the
   large scale (permeable) structure in addition to diffusion and reactions
   in the smaller scale (nonpermeable) structure. The extended pore tree
   model has successfully explained measurement errors in the permeability
   of soil due to the measurement scale size and has successfully predicted
   the bulk gaseous diffusivity in partially saturated soil as a function
   of a saturation scale size. The extended pore tree model provides an
   analytic: description of the pore structure of soil upon which bulk
   transport, small scale diffusion, and coupled chemical reactions may be
   added to accurately describe contaminant transport and in situ
   remediation.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of biodegradation were measured in a petroleum
   hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifer using a combination of field and
   laboratory methods. These methods are based on tracking concentration
   changes of substrates (both electron donors and accepters) or final
   products of microbial metabolism over time. Ground water at the study
   site (Hanahan, South Carolina) is anoxic, and sulfate reduction is the
   predominant terminal electron accepting process. Laboratory studies
   conducted with sediment cored from the site showed that C-14-toluene was
   mineralized to (CO2)-C-14 with a first-order degradation rate constant
   (k(tol)) of -0.01 d(-1) under sulfate-reducing conditions, Under
   nitrate-amended, Fe(III)-amended, or nonamended (methanogenic)
   conditions, toluene was not significantly mineralized, C-14-Benzene was
   degraded at low but measurable rates (k(ben) = -0.003 d(-1)) under
   sulfate-reducing conditions whereas degradation under methanogenic
   conditions was negligible, These results illustrate the extreme
   sensitivity of laboratory-measured biodegradation rates to terminal
   electron-accepting conditions, and show the necessity of carefully
   matching experimental conditions to in situ conditions. Concentration
   decreases of toluene along aquifer flowpaths, when the uncertainty of
   ground-water Bow velocities was considered, indicated k(tol) values
   ranging from -0.0075 to -0.03 d(-1). Concentration decreases of sulfate
   and concentration increases of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), when
   normalized for assumed stoichiometric oxidation of toluene coupled to
   sulfate reduction, yielded a k(SO4) range of -0.005 to -0.02 d(-1), and
   a k(DIC) value range of +0.00075 to +0.003 d(-1). Because both
   laboratory and field methods have numerous sources of uncertainty, a
   combination of these methods is the most appropriate procedure for
   evaluating biodegradation rate constants in contaminated ground-water
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Laguna Asososca, a large ground-water-fed volcanic crater, is an
   important source of municipal water supply for the city of Managua. In
   1990, after 65 years of pumping at increasing rates from the crater, the
   gradient between the Laguna and the highly contaminated Lake Managua had
   potentially reversed, leading to a scenario where the Laguna was
   possibly drawing in contaminated ground water from Lake Managua and/or a
   highly contaminated aquifer below an industrial area located between the
   Laguna and Lake Managua, A drilling and sampling program undertaken
   between 1990 and 1992 found: (1) four synthetic organic chemicals in the
   Laguna (methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,3-dichlorobenzene and
   1,4-dichlorobenzene), (2) numerous other synthetic organic chemicals
   near Laguna Asososca in the ground water below the industrial area, and
   (3) no evidence of Laguna Asososca drawing water from Lake Managua,It
   appears that the Laguna Asososca capture zone extended into the
   industrial area but not as far as Lake Managua, Ground-water flow
   modeling of the regional ground-water flow system was consistent with
   the field interpretation, Estimates of the relative mobilities of the
   synthetic organic chemicals indicated that the chemicals found in the
   water of Laguna Asososca likely represented the mobile leading edge of
   al contaminant plume emanating from the industrial area, The simplest
   and most effective solution to mitigate contamination of Laguna Asososca
   is to maintain its water level above that of Lake Managua by reducing
   its pumpage to about 50\% of the 1990 rate.}},

Abstract = {{Enthalpy and entropy of volatilization from dilute aqueous solutions for
   26 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been determined using Henry's
   Law values reported in published literature. Based on the linearity of
   van't Hoff plots, for the temperature ranges common in soils, the
   differences in heat capacities of volatilization for reactants and
   products are very small for the VOCs studied.
   When volatile solutes such as VOCs are present in soil water, soil-gas
   concentration often nearly is in equilibrium with the dissolved solute.
   Setchinow salting coefficients are linearly related to dissolved partial
   molar volumes for halogenated aliphatic compounds. Based in part on
   approximations from this linear relationship, equilibrium deviations
   from Henry's Law behavior for dilute VOC concentrations due to capillary
   tension or the presence of ionic solutes are small for common soil
   conditions.
   Since gas/water partitioning of VOCs if temperature-sensitive and since
   annual soil moisture and temperature patterns vary geographically in
   documented fashion, geographically specific temporal patterns in
   soil-gas VOC concentrations are predictable in vadose zones containing
   dissolved VOCs. A U.S. map depicting these general soil-moisture and
   temperature patterns is provided. Gas concentrations in vadose zones
   containing dissolved VOCs tend to increase with increasing temperature
   and decreasing moisture content due to equilibrium partitioning effects.
   Diagrams useful for understanding the results of soil-gas surveys and
   the efficacy of various remediation options are provided. The effect of
   bubbles in VOC water-sample vials on aqueous concentrations is shown to
   be very small. The effect of head-space volume of soil samples on
   estimated soil-gas concentrations can be large.}},

Title = {{Optimum hydraulic conductivity to limit contaminant flux through cutoff
   walls}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{719-726}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Cutoff walls are becoming increasingly attractive options for the
   control of solute migration from long-term sources of contamination. The
   main advantage of low permeability enclosures is that they restrict
   advective transport of solutes away from the source. However, with high
   concentration source zones surrounded by cutoff walls, there exists the
   potential for notable mass fluxes outward due to diffusive transport.
   This paper shows, through the use of the steady-state flux equations,
   that there is an optimal range of hydraulic conductivities for barrier
   materials which permit the outward diffusive flux to be counter balanced
   by an inward advective and dispersive flux. This concept of designing
   optimum contaminant containment using an inward advective flux to
   counter the outward diffusive flux is valid for sealable joint sheet
   pile walls, bentonite-slurry walls and clay liners, but not synthetic
   membrane materials with extremely low hydraulic conductivities. The
   effective diffusion coefficient for the common chlorinated organic
   solvents such as TCE in water-saturated clayey materials is
   approximately 1 x 10(-6) cm(2)/sec, resulting in an optimum hydraulic
   conductivity ranging from 1 x 10(-6) to 1 x 10(-8) cm/sec. This,range in
   hydraulic conductivity is within the range of common barrier materials
   but not the lowest achievable. The steady-state concentration profile in
   a slurry cutoff wall can result in a substantial amount of contaminant
   mass stored within the wall which will need to be considered over the
   long term or dealt with during site remediation. Large inward advective
   fluxes reduce the total chemical mass stored within the low permeability
   barrier material.}},

   surfactants}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{734-744}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Batch sorption and column transport laboratory experiments were
   performed to investigate the use of cationic surfactants to enhance
   sorption of dissolved organic contaminants in aquifer material with low
   organic carbon content. The experiments used sand from the Borden
   aquifer in Ontario, Canada, treated with hexadecyltrimethylammonium
   (HDTMA(+)) surfactant. Test results indicate that organic cations are
   strongly adsorbed by cation exchange reactions on the solid surface.
   Further adsorption occurs in admicelles, which form by hydrophobic
   interactions between adsorbed and mobile HDTMA monomers. The nonlinear
   adsorption Isotherm may be described by Langmuir adsorption theory. The
   retardation factor for HDTMA(+) on Borden aquifer material is
   approximately 460 when aqueous surfactant concentrations are less than
   100 mg/l, while HDTMA(+) is relatively mobile at higher concentrations.
   Column experiments suggest that tbe adsorption reaction is very rapid,
   and thus independent of ground-water flow velocity. A column treated
   with HDTMA(+) equivalent to 33\% of CEC and flushed with 325 pore
   volumes of surfactant-free water showed that although the HDTMA(+)
   modified zone was smeared downgradient, all HDTMA(+) mass remained
   adsorbed within the column. The results indicate that an essentially
   stationary surfactant-modified zone can be created.
   Adsorbed HDTMA(+) mass increased f(oc) from 0.02 wt\% on natural Borden
   aquifer material to 0.18 wt\% on the treated sediments. Organic matter
   derived from the adsorbed HDTMA(+) is an effective partitioning medium
   for dissolved HOC, and results indicate that it may sorb HOC more
   efficiently than natural f(oc) on a unit weight basis. Batch sorption
   tests showed that sorption coefficients (K-d) for trichloroethylene
   (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) were 13
   times higher on HDTMA(+) treated Borden aquifer material compared to the
   natural sediments. Retardation factors estimated from column transport
   tests confirmed these results, and suggested that sorption of moderately
   hydrophobic organic contaminants on the HDTMA(+) modified sediments was
   a rapid and reversible process. Data from these laboratory-scale
   experiments indicate that it may be feasible to develop an enhanced
   sorption zone in situ in a low f(oc) aquifer as part of a ground-water
   remediation scheme for dissolved organic pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Samana Cay, Bahamas, is a leading candidate among the sites proposed as
   the first landfall of Columbus in the New World. One main point of
   contention against this identification is that Samana lacks a feature
   matching the laguna observed by Columbus in the middle of his landfall
   island. However, this argument has failed to consider the
   paleogeographic aspects of the problem. A hydrogeologic computer model
   suggests the existence of a sizable surface-water feature in the medial
   interior of Samana Cay under conditions theorized to have been present
   when Columbus arrived in the Bahamas. This feature may correspond to the
   laguna described by Columbus.}},

Abstract = {{Soil gas pump tests are commonly performed to identify important
   unsaturated zone parameters such as the effective gas permeability
   tensor and the influence of tight or leaky confining units. An
   interactive FORTRAN computer program called GASSOLVE has been developed
   for analyzing these tests under both transient and steady-state
   conditions. The code uses one of two general analytical solutions for
   radially symmetric gas flow to a well: the solution for transient
   compressible gas flow to a partially penetrating well in which the
   ground surface is open to the atmosphere; and the solution for transient
   compressible gas flow to a partially penetrating well bounded above by a
   leaky confining layer. Pump tests involving steady-state conditions,
   fully penetrating wells, or tight confining layers are considered as
   special cases of these solutions. The field gas pressure data from
   multiple observation wells are inverted using a multidimensional
   nonlinear optimization routine to provide ii best fit of the data with
   the selected analytical solution.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-through microcosms were constructed to conduct ecological
   experiments on aquifer organisms. The two 5-channel microcosms were
   simple to construct, were fed by an artesian spring, and maintained
   close to in situ temperature and O-2 concentrations, They were used to
   test relative microbial colonization of three substrate sizes: silt
   (0.063 mm), sand (0.9 mm), and gravel (3 mm). After 96 days of
   incubation, O-2 microelectrode measurements revealed the lowest Oz
   tension in the silt, the highest in the gravel, and intermediate values
   in the sand. Microbial activity ((3){[}H]-thymidine incorporation) was
   greatest in the gravel, followed by sand and then silt. Denitrification
   was greatest in the silt, followed by sand and then gravel. Microbial
   activity may be greatest with the largest particle size because of
   increased water exchange through pores, and denitrification may be
   greatest with the smallest particle sizes because of the occurrence of
   anaerobic microzones.}},

Abstract = {{A test of the In Situ Permeable Flow Sensor was conducted in which
   ground-water flow velocity measurements made by the flow sensors were
   directly compared to velocity estimates obtained using standard
   hydrologic techniques, Two flow sensors were deployed in a confined
   aquifer in close proximity to a well which was screened over the entire
   vertical extent of the aquifer, When the well was pumped at four
   different pumping rates, the horizontal component of the flow velocity
   measured by the flow sensors was directed toward the pumping well,
   within the uncertainty in the measurements, and the magnitude of the
   horizontal component of the velocity increased linearly with pumping
   rate, as predicted by theoretical considerations. The measured
   magnitudes differed from predicted values, calculated with the
   assumption that the hydraulic properties of the aquifer were homogeneous
   and isotropic, by less than a factor of two, Vertical components of
   ground-water flow observed with. the flow sensors are qualitatively
   consistent with the vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity
   estimated from grain-size analysis but are significantly larger in
   magnitude than predicted, This is likely due to the creation of a
   vertical conduit of increased hydraulic conductivity during emplacement
   of the probes, The results suggest that while the flow sensors measured
   the local ground-water flow velocity vector during the test quite
   accurately, care must be exercised to disturb the formation as little as
   possible during emplacement. The technology has many potential uses,
   particularly in the area of environmental site characterization and
   remediation process monitoring.}},

   have seriously impacted residential areas and prime agricultural land.
   The Arizona Department of Water Resources in conjunction with Yuma
   County Flood Control District developed a regional three-dimensional
   ground-water flow model of the Yuma area, The purpose of the model is to
   assist local agencies in evaluating remedial water management
   alternatives to mitigate the shallow ground-water level problems.
   The model domain incorporates over 900 ml(-2) of Arizona, California,
   and Mexico and simulates ground-water pumpage, deep percolation from
   agricultural irrigation, evapotranspiration from phreatophytes and flow
   in 12 canals, 16 drains, and the Colorado and Gila Rivers, The model
   contains four layers with over 30,000 model cells ranging in size from
   40 acres to 640 acres.
   Different model scenario simulations were conducted to evaluate the
   effectiveness of proposed water management alternatives on lowering
   ground-water levels within the northern portion of Yuma Valley, These
   scenarios include lining a portion of the East Main canal and pumping
   two drainage wells, lining the All-American canal, and simulating a
   decrease in deep percolation from agricultural irrigation on the Yuma
   Mesa and northern portion of Yuma Valley.}},

Abstract = {{Case histories of LNAPL contaminated sites indicate that LNAPL
   thicknesses in monitoring wells exhibit certain characteristic behaviors
   when related to water-table fluctuations. This paper investigates these
   behaviors using established theories for fluid saturations in
   three-phase (air-LNAPL-water) porous media systems. A semianalytical
   model is developed to predict the LNAPL thickness in a monitoring well
   considering the effects of saturation hysteresis and air/LNAPL
   entrapment. Given the total LNAPL volume in the soil profile and the
   historical sequence of water-table elevations, the model predicts LNAPL
   thicknesses, based on the assumption of a succession of hydrostatic
   pressure distributions. For example simulations, the model indicates
   that the LNAPL thickness in a monitoring well can exhibit complex
   behaviors that are strongly dependent on the previous saturation
   history. While many of these predicted behaviors are consistent with
   field observations, some are not. This suggests that certain aspects of
   current theories pertaining to three-phase fluid saturations warrant
   further technical evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{An artificial fen environment was constructed near the municipality of
   Beavercreek, Ohio, The constructed wetland environment utilizes local
   ground-water flow patterns to maintain a high degree of water
   saturation. Chemical reactions driven by the activity of plant roots and
   soil microorganisms affect the spatial distribution and magnitude of
   hydrogeochemical parameters, including alkalinity, pH, redox potential,
   and concentrations of Ca+2, Mg+2, total iron, NO3-, and SO4-2. The
   purpose of this study is to investigate the chemical interactions
   between wetland plants and ground water by means of characterizing the
   spatial variation in hydrogeochemical parameters, Nested piezometers
   within the artificial fen are used to monitor ground-water chemistry
   within, and immediately adjacent to, the rhizosphere of cultivated plant
   species, The major reactions at the site include oxidation of organic
   matter by Fe(OH)(3) and dissolution of carbonate minerals driven by high
   CO2 production in the root zone, The relationship between alkalinity and
   dissolved concentrations of Ca+2 and Mg+2 suggests that organic anions
   could also be major alkalinity contributors, Redox potential is buffered
   by the reduction of Fe(OH)(3) and is typically maintained in the range
   of 100-200 mV. This buffering effect prevents the formation of sulfide
   and methane commonly found in similar wetland environments, This finding
   suggests that methane production associated with rice cultivation can be
   prevented by the addition of Fe(OH)(3) to rice fields.}},

Abstract = {{Combined optimization-simulation models for designing ground-water
   remediation systems generally focus on design strategies that use only
   one remedial technology, typically pumping. In practice, many field
   remediation programs use pumping along with one or more additional
   ground-water control technologies, such as drains, trenches, slurry
   walls, and low permeability caps, Simulated annealing provides a
   flexible optimization framework that can incorporate a number of
   different remedial technologies into the design process, Using simulated
   annealing, additional remedial technologies can be added to or
   subtracted from the optimization at any time. This flexibility can
   provide for remedial design evaluations that are more consistent with
   current field implementations. The use of simulated annealing is
   demonstrated by a series of hypothetical remediation design problems
   that incorporate four different remedial technologies. The computed
   optimal design solution depends on the relative costs of the remedial
   tools as specified by the cost function and on the effects that each
   tool has on the system behavior. A sensitivity analysis can reveal which
   costs are critical to the outcome of the optimization.}},

Abstract = {{On March 8 and 9, 1992, a thermal-infrared-multispectral scanner (TIMS)
   was flown over two military ordnance disposal facilities at the Edgewood
   Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, The data, collected by the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in cooperation with the
   U.S. Army and the U.S. Geological Survey, were used to locate
   ground-water discharge zones in surface water, The images from the
   flight show areas where ground-water discharge is concentrated, as well
   as areas of diffuse discharge, Concentrated discharge is predominant in
   isolated or nearly isolated ponds and creeks in the study area, Diffuse
   discharge is found near parts of the shoreline where the study area
   meets the surrounding estuaries of the Chesapeake Bay and the Gunpowder
   River, The average temperature for surface water, measured directly in
   the field, and the average temperature, calculated from atmospherically
   corrected TIMS images, was 10.6 degrees C (Celsius) at the first of two
   sites.
   Potentiometric surface maps of both field sites show discharge toward
   the nontidal marshes, the estuaries which surround the field sites, and
   creeks which drain into the estuaries, The average measured temperature
   of ground water at both sites was 10.7 degrees C. The calculated
   temperature from the TIMS imagery at both sites where ground-water
   discharge is concentrated within a surface-water body is 10.4 degrees C,
   In the estuaries which surround the field sites, field measurements of
   temperature were made resulting in an average temperature of 9.0 degrees
   C, The average calculated TIMS temperature from the estuaries was 9.3
   degrees C. Along the shoreline at the first site and within 40 to 80
   meters of the western and southern shores of the second site, water was
   1 degrees to 2 degrees C warmer than water more than 80 meters away,
   This pattern of warmer water grading to cooler water in an offshore
   direction could result from diffuse ground-water discharge, Tonal
   differences in the TIMS imagery could indicate changes in surface-water
   temperatures, These tonal differences can be interpreted to delineate
   the location and extent of ground-water discharge to bodies of surface
   water.}},

Abstract = {{A structured approach for calibrating two-dimensional, steady-state

   boundary conditions are adjusted with the aid of a scattergram to reduce
   bias of the simulated hydraulic head distribution of the equivalent
   homogeneous aquifer. After the bias is removed, the differences between
   the simulated mean hydraulic head and the observed hydraulic head,
   resulting from small-scale heterogeneities, are then reduced by
   adjustment of local transmissivity values based on hydrological and
   geological information. The validity of the proposed procedure was
   tested for a hypothetical aquifer under idealized conditions and it was
   then applied to the Avra Valley in southern Arizona to demonstrate its

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The performance of air sparging systems, as measured by the predicted
   region of airflow, was investigated by conducting numerical simulations
   with a multiphase modeling program (TETRAD), The simulations employed
   standard two-phase flow theory, and included pressure-dependent
   calculations of the compressibility of water and air, Simulations tested
   the response of air sparging systems to variations in geological
   properties (intrinsic permeability and anisotropy of permeability) as
   well as different injection scenarios (depth, pressure, and rate of
   injection).
   Three stages of flow behavior are predicted following initiation of air
   injection, These are: (1) an initial transient period of growth in the
   lateral and vertical limits of airflow (expansion stage); (2) a second
   transient period of reduction in the lateral limits of airflow (collapse
   stage); and (3) a steady-state stage, during which the system remains
   static as long as injection parameters do not change, In homogeneous
   media the geometry of the region of airflow changes from a teardrop- or
   bell-shaped configuration to a shape that is roughly conical during the
   expansion stage, During the collapse stage, air is preferentially
   diverted to established regions of high effective air permeability, and
   ground water resaturates the remainder of the original region of
   influence, For pilot testing it is important to realize that
   measurements of the lateral extent of airflow expansion and collapse
   stages can be misleading because they will differ from the limits
   established at steady-state, The time required for a particular system
   to progress through the transient stages and establish steady-slate
   behavior can vary from hours to years, and is dependent on the
   permeability structure of the aquifer, injection depth, and injection
   rate, Under homogeneous conditions the maximum width of the region of
   airflow attained during the transient expansion stage was substantially
   greater than the width attained at steady-state.
   The width of the steady-state region of airflow is significantly
   affected by all the variables investigated, except injection depth,
   which appears to primarily influence the transient behavior, The
   simulations further show that the vertical permeability and anisotropy
   of the aquifer are very important variables, and warrant routine
   assessment during design of sparge systems, Simulation of heterogeneous
   media demonstrate that complex airflow patterns will occur as a result
   of air pending beneath, and flow around, zones of low air permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Because geologic settings are not fully known (data are sparse) and
   because geologic properties vary spatially, flow modelers resort to
   simplifying conceptualization (simplified geological models) of the
   settings to perform modeling. But as results of identification of a
   simplified model depend on identification problem formulation,
   simplification poses two issues: (1) Since coupled identification and
   prediction problems are differently formulated problems, successful
   identification (calibration) of a model does not mean that the model
   will be good in prediction, so the goal of model identification should
   be the model's parameters effective in an intended application. (2)
   Since the identification results are problem-dependent, they may be
   deprived of geological meaning. Therefore, they should be interpreted in
   the terms of their relation to the real world: To use them without
   understanding their meanings is potentially damaging. The key to both
   issues is explicit mathematical presentation of the spatially variable
   geologic properties transformations to the ground-water model
   parameters. Canonical forms of the transformations, displaying readily
   inherent features of those transformations, are introduced. Two-level
   modeling, exploiting the canonical forms, is suggested as an approach to
   address the above-mentioned issues. The higher level models represent
   real geologic settings. The lower level model presents a conventional
   geological model. Comparison of responses to the same impact between the
   higher level models and the geological model should permit inference of
   the canonical forms for the given geological model. The forms can be
   used to choose predictive model effective parameters, interpret observed
   data, and optimize field investigation. Two simple examples illustrate
   the main notions of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticide transport from the soil surface to the ground-water table was
   modeled by means of an analytical solution of the convection-dispersion
   equation, assuming steady water flow, a linear sorption isotherm and
   first-order transformation kinetics. Pesticide transport in the
   saturated zone to a well was described by means of an analytical
   solution of the conservation equation for a cylindrical flow system,
   assuming steady flow, no dispersion, linear sorption, and first-order
   transformation. We derived an analytical solution for this coupled
   unsaturated-saturated system. We limited our analysis to systems that
   are difficult to protect with a protection zone. The strongest
   fluctuations in the pesticide concentration in the well were calculated
   for the lowest frequency of application, shortest characteristic travel
   time in the saturated zone and shortest half-life in the saturated zone,
   A simplified model, ignoring the variation of travel times in the
   unsaturated zone, resulted in concentration fluctuations in the well,
   The peak concentrations differed less than two times from those
   calculated with the analytical coupled unsaturated-saturated model,
   except for cases with the combination of a short characteristic travel
   time and a short half-life in the saturated zone.}},

Title = {{Improving the quality of parameter estimates obtained from slug tests}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{480-490}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{The slug test is one of the most commonly used field methods for
   obtaining in situ estimates of hydraulic conductivity. Despite its
   prevalence, this method has received criticism from many quarters in the
   ground-water community. This criticism emphasizes the poor quality of
   the estimated parameters, a condition that is primarily a product of the
   somewhat casual approach that is often employed in slug tests. Recently,
   the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS) has pursued research directed at
   improving methods for the performance and analysis of slug tests. Based
   on extensive theoretical and field research, a series of guidelines have
   been proposed that should enable the quality of parameter estimates to
   be improved. The most significant of these guidelines are: (1) three or
   more slug tests should be performed at each well during a given test
   period;(2) two or more different initial displacements (He) should be
   used at each well during a test period; (3) the method used to initiate
   a test should enable the slug to be introduced in a near-instantaneous
   manner and should allow a good estimate of Ho to be obtained; (4)
   data-acquisition equipment that enables a large quantity of high quality
   data to be collected should be employed; (5) if an estimate of the
   storage parameter is needed, an observation well other than the test
   well should be employed; (6) the method chosen for analysis of the
   slug-test data should be appropriate for site conditions; (7) use of
   pre- and post-analysis plots should be an integral component of the
   analysis procedure, and (8) appropriate well construction parameters
   should be employed. Data from slug tests performed at a number of KGS
   field sites demonstrate the importance of these guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{The Prairie Ronde fan, a discrete glaciofluvial deposit in southwestern
   Michigan, contains a productive but highly vulnerable unconfined aquifer
   used for irrigation, municipal, and domestic supply, A comprehensive
   hydrogeological study of the aquifer delineated shallow, local flow
   systems that interact with ponds and wetlands on the fan surface,
   overlying a deeper intermediate/regional flow system extending to the
   base of the glacial drift, Ground water within the shallow flow systems
   contains tritium concentrations indicative of a post-bomb age and is
   heavily impacted by nonpoint source contamination, Nitrate commonly
   exceeds drinking water standards in the shallow flow system, Although no
   continuous physical barrier separates the two flow systems, the deeper
   flow system is generally lacking in tritium as well as nonpoint source
   contaminants derived from surface land uses, High capacity pumping from
   the deeper flow system, however, will likely draw contaminants downward
   from the shallow flow system, Background-water quality in the aquifer is
   controlled by equilibrium with calcite and slight undersaturation with
   respect to dolomite, No spatial trends in major ions were observed,
   suggesting that carbonate mineral equilibrium is achieved rapidly in the
   vadose zone and further chemical evolution along ground-water flow paths
   is minimal, Iron concentrations are highly variable in the aquifer and
   not correlated with depth, Recharge from lakes and wetlands is a
   significant cause of elevated iron concentrations in the shallow flow
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogeological decision analysis is applied to the design of a
   performance monitoring network at a waste management facility overlying
   fractured bedrock. The objective of the monitoring system is to detect
   contaminants before they reach a regulatory compliance boundary in order
   to enable early and less costly on-site remediation, and avoid the
   potentially more costly consequences of failure. Features in the design
   of the monitoring network include the number of monitoring wells to be
   installed and their locations, where in each borehole to position
   discrete monitoring zones, and how often to take water samples. The
   decision model identifies the preferred monitoring strategy as the
   design alternative, among all those considered, that minimizes the sum
   of the monitoring costs and the expected costs of failure and on-site
   remediation. At a given distance from the facility, the highest
   probabilities of plume detection are obtained when the fractures
   intersecting the borehole wall that carry the largest flows are
   monitored. Monitoring intervals centered on fractures with highest
   aperture, or regions of highest fracture density, yield intermediate
   values, while intervals located at predetermined depths yield the lowest
   probabilities of detection. The monitoring scheme with the highest
   probability of detection is not necessarily the preferred monitoring
   strategy. For monitoring options that have a higher probability of
   detection than the preferred monitoring strategy, the higher expected
   cost of on-site remediation, when combined with the increased cost of
   monitoring required to provide the higher probability of detection, can
   outweigh the reduction in the expected cost of failure brought about by
   a higher probability of detection. When the probability of contaminants
   migrating to the compliance boundary is small during the compliance
   period, changes in the probability of detection brought about by a more
   intense monitoring effort do not affect the expected cost of failure
   much; in these instances, the decision model may point to a reduced
   effort in performance monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{It is a general belief that useful estimates of total dissolved solids
   concentrations of ground water cannot be made from borehole geophysical
   logs, A case study of estimating total dissolved solids concentration of
   ground water in the local area using the ratio method yielded estimates
   with an average error of less than 25 percent, The results do not
   support the hypothesis that useful estimates of total dissolved solids
   concentration cannot be made from borehole geophysical logs.
   The case study included a comparison of estimates of total dissolved
   solids concentration utilizing a resistivity of the mud input versus
   using resistivity of the mud filtrate input, Estimates made using
   resistivity of mud had a correlation coefficient of 0.97 whereas
   estimates using resistivity of mud filtrate had a correlation
   coefficient of only 0.27, The results from the case study suggest that
   at least in some cases the resistivity of the mud (R(m)) may produce a
   better estimate of the resistivity of water (R(W)) in the fully flushed
   zone than an estimate using the resistivity of the mud filtrate R(mf).
   The ratio method can be easily used to estimate ground-water resistivity
   and total dissolved solids concentration of the formation water based
   only on data from resistivity logs, The advantage of the method is that
   data on porosity, cementation exponent, temperature, and volume of clay
   are not required, The method, which has been used by the oil industry to
   crudely estimate water resistivity, is based in part on the ratio of the
   resistivity of a fully water-saturated formation to the resistivity of
   the fully flushed zone adjacent to the annulus in a mud-filled borehole,
   The method, which is very robust, requires only an estimate of the
   resistivity of a fully water-saturated formation from a deep looking
   induction or resistivity log, an estimate of the resistivity of the
   fully flushed zone from a microresistivity or short normal log, and a
   measurement of resistivity of the mud or mud filtrate and its
   temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The Hilton Head Island Test Well \#1 was drilled to a depth of 3833 feet
   to evaluate the upper Cretaceous section as a potential ground-water
   source for Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The initial plan was to
   analyze continuous conventional cores. The interval to be analyzed
   extended from the top of the Eocene to the base of the Cretaceous
   (approximately 3500 feet). However, due to the high cost (\$400,000),
   the decision was made to evaluate aquifer potential using advanced
   geophysical logs with sidewall cores for calibration.
   The logging suite consisted of a dual induction resistivity, spontaneous
   potential, compensated neutron, density log, gamma ray, spectral gamma,
   multipole array acoustic log, caliper, high resolution dipmeter, and a
   circumferential borehole imaging log. In addition to the wireline logs,
   239 sidewall cores and 12 Formation Multi-Test samples were obtained.
   The log, sidewall core, and FMT information were integrated into an
   interpretive package using computer generated logs and simple
   spreadsheets to calculate aquifer properties. Porosity, hydraulic
   conductivity, transmissivity, and lithologic data derived from this
   integrated analysis were then used to select screen zones. Water quality
   in relation to drinking water standards exceeded expectations. The
   information obtained from the integrated program allowed estimates to be
   made about the well's productivity without the expense of conventional
   coring, flow testing, and completion of the well.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to assess how ion exchange
   processes, which occur during subsurface transport of oilfield brines,
   manifest themselves on graphical water quality diagrams. Concentrated
   brine soil column studies indicated sodium in the brine solution is able
   to exchange for calcium and magnesium on the soil, thereby retarding
   transport of sodium relative to the average ground-water velocity and
   resulting in the development of a `'hardness halo'' at the leading edge
   of the brine plume. In this zone, calcium and magnesium concentrations
   exceed the values for both the brine and the fresh ground water. The
   hardness halo manifests itself as a characteristic deviation away from
   the mixing lines on the Piper diagram. Initially, the hardness halo
   causes concentrations to plot left of the fresh-water end member in the
   cationic triangle. Chloride domination in oilfield brine causes
   concentrations to plot in the lower right corner of the anionic triangle
   almost immediately. After the hardness halo passes through the column,
   the sampling results show a characteristic pattern of movement parallel
   to the mixing line in the cation triangle or along the (decreasing)
   hardness axis of the upper diamond of the Piper diagram. The laboratory
   results were similar to those exhibited by monitoring well samples taken
   at a field site involving oilfield brine contamination. The results of
   this study show the Piper diagram to be potentially useful for early
   detection of brine contamination episodes.}},

Abstract = {{Two aquifer pumping tests (13 and 24 hours) and a tracer injection test
   were performed on shallow (7.5 m) clay and silty-clay sediments of the
   fluvial-deltaic Beaumont Formation from the U.S. Gulf Coast. The in situ
   horizontal hydraulic conductivity determined from these tests is found
   to be approximately 10(-3) cm/sec. This value is one to three orders of
   magnitude larger than that of typical silts and clays, and two to four
   orders of magnitude larger than the vertical hydraulic conductivity
   measured on core in laboratory permeameter experiments. A uniformity of
   the drawdown curves from different observation wells strongly suggests
   that hydraulic conductivity is relatively homogeneous and isotropic in
   the horizontal plane at the scale of the test. This relatively large in
   situ horizontal hydraulic conductivity for these clay-rich sediments is
   attributed to macroporosity rather than matrix porosity.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The potential for bioremediation of ground water polluted with various
   alkylpyridines was investigated. Aerobic bacteria, indigenous to the
   ground-water aquifer, were utilized for biodegradation of the various
   contaminants. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that biodegradation
   occurred only under aerobic and not under anaerobic conditions. Analysis
   of the ground water in the site indicated that levels of oxygen were
   below 1 mg/l. Thus, it is suggested that oxygen limitation prevented the
   biodegradation of pollutants in the aquifer. Phosphate amendment (5
   mg/l) into slurries of contaminated sediment and ground water resulted
   in enhanced degradation rates. Columns filled with aquifer material and
   leached with contaminated ground water were used to simulate possible in
   situ bioremediation. Reduction in concentration of the different
   compounds in column effluents ranged between 40 and 80\%, with 2,3-,
   2,6-, and 3,5-lutidine degrading at lower rates than other contaminants.
   In addition to in situ treatment, the potential of using aboveground
   systems for treatment was explored. A mixed culture capable of degrading
   14 different alkylpyridines was isolated from the subsurface sediment.
   This culture was used to seed a two-stage fixed film reactor, The
   reactor was fed with a mixture of organic acids and alkylpyridines that
   simulated the ground-water composition. The reactors were very effective
   in removing the pollutants from the waste stream. The efficiency of
   alkylpyridine removal was between 98 and 100\% and overall COD removal
   was 97\%, when operating at a loading rate of 4.32 g COD/L-h and
   hydraulic retention time of 3 h, These results imply that a combined
   approach which utilizes both in situ and aboveground treatments should
   be used for the bioremediation of polluted ground water.}},

Title = {{Effect of trapped gas on dissolved oxygen transport - Implications for

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Abstract = {{In situ bioremediation of contaminated aquifers is often limited by the
   concentration of dissolved oxygen in the ground water. Various methods
   have been used to increase dissolved oxygen concentrations in ground
   water, but the effect of a trapped gas phase on the distribution and
   transport of dissolved oxygen needs to be understood. The
   two-dimensional transport of dissolved oxygen is investigated in
   experiments conducted in a large-scale physical aquifer model (2 m X 4 m
   X 0.2 m) where a gas phase is trapped in the pore spaces of an
   otherwise-saturated porous medium. The transport of dissolved oxygen is
   shown to be retarded up to 11.2 times the transport of the bulk water
   due to the mass transfer of oxygen between the aqueous phase and the
   trapped gas phase. The theoretical model for dissolved gas transport in
   the presence of a trapped gas phase is evaluated in a two-dimensional
   ground-water flow field using the U.S.G.S. numerical model MOC. The
   results show that dissolved oxygen transport can be modeled with the
   advection-dispersion equation with linear equilibrium mass transfer but
   only when the longitudinal dispersion is increased compared to the value
   determined using a bromide tracer of the water flow. Increased
   longitudinal dispersion of the dissolved oxygen plume may be due to a
   temporally or spatially varying retardation factor or rate-limited mass
   transfer. The presence of even a small amount of a trapped gas phase in
   an aquifer will significantly affect the distribution and transport of
   dissolved oxygen (trapped gas filling only 5\% of the pore space will
   cause a retardation factor for oxygen of 2.6 at T = 15 degrees C) and
   thus should be considered when designing ways to increase the dissolved
   oxygen concentration in ground water for in situ bioremediation.}},

Abstract = {{Surface application offers an inexpensive, noninvasive alternative to
   injection wells and infiltration galleries for in situ ground-water
   bioremediation applications. The technology employs artificial recharge
   to create favorable hydraulic conditions for mixing and vertical
   transport of supplemental electron acceptor and nutrients. A test plot
   infiltration test and a conservative tracer test at Eglin Air Force
   Base, FL confirmed the potential for transporting solutes to the
   subsurface via recharging water. These experiments demonstrated both the
   mounding hydraulics and vertical solute transport that occurs in
   response to surface application. Modeling provided quantitative
   estimates of site-specific hydrogeologic and transport parameters.
   Experimental results also indicated that dilution may be a dominant
   attenuation mechanism associated with high surface application rates.
   The tests also served as the basis for the design of a pilot scale
   surface application system for delivery of nitrate to bioremediate a
   JP-4 contaminated aquifer at the Eglin site. Models calibrated to data
   from the infiltration experiment were scaled up for design of the pilot
   scale surface application system. Preliminary tracer results from the
   pilot scale experiment confirm that surface application can adequately
   deliver chemicals to the subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{A new technology called the In Situ Permeable Flow Sensor has been
   developed at Sandia National Laboratories. These sensors use a thermal
   perturbation technique to directly measure the direction and magnitude
   of the full three-dimensional ground-water flow velocity vector in
   unconsolidated, saturated, porous media. The velocity measured is an
   average value characteristic of an approximately 1 cubic meter volume of
   the subsurface. The sensors are permanently buried in direct contact
   with the formation at the point where the velocity measurement is to be
   made. While this deployment strategy means that the approximately \$2500
   instruments are not recovered, borehole effects which can negatively
   influence the quality of the measurement are avoided. The sensors can be
   connected to a data acquisition system which can be monitored remotely,
   via modem and telephone connection, for extended periods of time. The
   technology is able to measure flow velocities in the range of 5 X 10(-6)
   to 1 X 10(-3) cm/s, depending on the thermal properties of the medium in
   which it is buried.}},

Abstract = {{The application of dissolved stable gases as injected ground-water
   tracers is a relatively new area of study, and the transport behavior of
   dissolved gases in a comprehensive range of saturated porous media types
   is poorly understood. Gas tracers, and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) in
   particular, possess many of the characteristics of an ideal
   conservative, nonreactive tracer. SF6 is a volatile, nontoxic, inorganic
   gas that, when dissolved in water, behaved similarly to bromide in an
   idealized highly uniform saturated medium, exhibiting little physical
   nonequilibrium. For sand possessing significant intragranular porosity,
   SF6 did not show persistent tailing as a result of physical
   nonequilibrium transport to the same degree as bromide. This is
   consistent with less mass transfer of SF6 to immobile porosity due to
   its lower diffusion coefficient. This nonequilibrium is enhanced by the
   high pore-water velocities employed. SF6 is slightly hydrophobic, with a
   measured octanol-water partitioning coefficient of 13.8. This raises the
   question of whether SF6 would be slightly retarded in media with
   significant organic carbon, but no evidence of retardation was seen in
   sand with f(oc) as high as 2.5 wt\%.}},

Title = {{Controls on Rn-222 variations in a fractured crystalline rock aquifer
   evaluated using aquifer tests and geophysical logging}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{250-261}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of Rn-222 in ground water may vary considerably within
   megascopically homogeneous rocks over relatively short distances.
   Calculations indicate that different hydraulic apertures of
   water-bearing fractures may account for variations in dissolved Rn-222
   concentration measured in domestic water wells completed in fractured
   Pikes Peak Granite, assuming that all other factors influencing
   dissolved Rn-222 concentrations are constant. Concentrations of
   dissolved Rn-222 range from 124 to 840 kBq m(-3) {[}3,360 to 22,700
   picocuries per liter (pCi L(-1))] within a 2.5 km(2) well field, Aquifer
   tests show that transmissivities range from 0.072 to 160 m(2) day(-1)
   within the well field, Acoustic televiewer and heat-pulse now meter
   logging of four wells reveals that, despite tens to hundreds of
   fractures that intersect each well, a single fracture supplies all the
   flow to three wells, and one fracture provides 65\% of the flow to the
   fourth well, Aquifer tests indicate that two pairs of the four wells are
   hydraulically connected, Type-curve interpretation of early-time data
   from aquifer tests reveals classic half-slope behavior on log-log plots
   of drawdown versus time for two wells, suggesting linear flow to a
   single fracture, Drawdown versus time for the other two wells indicates
   radial or pseudo-radial flow, which suggests a higher degree of fracture
   interconnectivity near those boreholes.
   Hydraulic apertures calculated using the cubic law are 0.024 and 0.038
   cm for producing fractures in the first hydraulically connected well
   pair and 0.011 and 0.020 cm for flowing fractures in the second well
   pair, Assuming uniform distribution of Ra-226 along fracture walls and
   long residence time of water relative to Rn-222 decay, the ratio of
   fracture apertures should equal the inverse ratio of Rn-222
   concentration in each well, Assuming 50\% error in hydraulic aperture
   estimation and 10\% analytical uncertainty in Rn-222 measurement,
   differences in 222Rn concentration between wells in the hydraulically
   connected pairs can be attributed solely to differences in hydraulic
   aperture. Different hydraulic apertures, however, do not explain
   different Rn-222 concentrations between well pairs, Allowing for
   measurement error, a cubic meter of rock transfers from 1.3 to 20 times
   more Rn-222 to ground water in the first pair of wells than in the
   second pair, Nonuniform distribution of Ra-226 along fracture walls,
   heterogeneous emanating power in the rock-water system, or short
   ground-water residence time along the transmissive fracture network may
   account for the difference between well pairs.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a field experiment comparing water-quality constituents,
   specific conductance, geophysical measurements, and well-bore hydraulics
   in two long-screen wells and adjacent vertical clusters of short-screen
   wells show bias in ground-water data caused by well-bore flow in
   long-screen wells, The well screen acts as a conduit for vertical flow
   because it connects zones of different head and transmissivity, even in
   a relatively homogeneous, unconfined, sand and gravel aquifer where such
   zones are almost indistinguishable. Flow in the well bore redistributes
   water and solutes in the aquifer adjacent to the well, increasing the
   risk of bias in water-quality samples, failure of plume detection, and
   cross-contamination of the aquifer, At one site, downward flow from a
   contaminated zone redistributes solutes over the entire length of the
   long-screen well, At another site, upward flow from an uncontaminated
   zone masks the presence of a road salt plume,
   Borehole induction logs, conducted in a fully penetrating short-screen
   well, can provide a profile of solutes in the aquifer that is not
   attainable in long-screen wells, In this study, the induction-log
   profiles show close correlation with data from analyses of water-quality
   samples from the short-screen wells; however, both of these data sets
   differ markedly from the biased water-quality samples from the
   long-screen wells, Therefore, use of induction logs in fully cased wells
   for plume detection and accurate placement of short-screen wells is a
   viable alternative to use of long screen wells for water-quality
   sampling.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory and field experiments have shown that cationic surfactants
   can be used to modify aquifer materials, and thereby form zones of
   enhanced sorption for hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOC's) migrating
   in ground water. Coupled to a contaminant degradation or removal
   process, this concept has potential as a remediation technology,In order
   to apply enhanced sorption in a remediation scheme, an ability to
   predict the transport and partitioning behavior of cationic surfactants
   in the subsurface is necessary, In this paper we present the results of
   a numerical modeling study in which the transport and partitioning
   behavior of the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride
   (HDTMA) in porous media is investigated. Modeling of previously
   published batch and column HDTMA sorption experimental results for
   Columbus Air Force Base aquifer material indicates that, under certain
   conditions, kinetic effects will dominate the transport process with
   slow desorption of HDTMA being the likely rate-controlling step. The
   results suggest that a significant departure from equilibrium will exist
   under natural gradient conditions for the Columbus aquifer material, Low
   aqueous surfactant concentrations can be expected to persist within a
   surfactant-enhanced sorption zone, even after considerable flushing with
   surfactant-free ground water. The low aqueous concentration may have
   implications in terms of toxicity to microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal neutron logging is used to determine water content by measuring
   the elastic scattering due to hydrogen present in rocks and soils. The
   response of a thermal neutron device is also affected by the radiative
   capture of thermal neutrons by all elements. Chlorine has a large
   capture cross section in comparison to other elements usually found in
   aquifers; therefore, theory predicts that thermal neutron devices should
   respond to the presence of chlorinated solvents. Thermal neutron logging
   performed during a controlled release of perchloroethylene (PCE)
   confirmed that these methods can be used successfully to detect and
   monitor chlorinated solvents in the subsurface. To quantify the field
   results, a series of laboratory tests assessed the response of a neutron
   moisture probe used in the field experiments. These tests show that this
   device is very sensitive to the presence of chlorine and provide a basis
   for converting its response into an apparent PCE saturation. These
   saturation values compare favorably with PCE saturations obtained from
   core samples.}},

Abstract = {{A model of the nitrogen cycle and nitrate leaching in soil, called
   MORELN, was developed to calculate the nitrate flux percolating from
   soils into aquifers, It uses a `'coupled model,'' which simulates both
   surface and subsurface flows, A third model, NEWSAM, is linked to the
   above models to simulate nitrate migration in an aquifer system, This
   methodology gives a quantitative global description of nitrate transfer,
   taking into account both leaching in soils and migration in aquifers,
   Three examples of application tested this methodology (especially the
   nitrate leaching code, MORELN) at different scales and with different
   emphases: (1) in a soil plot of several square meters; (2) in a small
   experimental basin of several square kilometers; and (3) in a regional
   hydrogeologic system of several hundred square kilometers. Satisfactory
   results were obtained for the simulation of nitrate leaching at the
   small scale, Major differences between the measured and simulated
   nitrate concentrations were observed in a regional aquifer, where the
   measured concentration does not spatially correlate and the larger
   spatial variability of the input data were averaged in the model.}},

Abstract = {{The simulation-optimization approach is used to identify ground-water
   pumping strategies for control of the shallow water table in the western
   San Joaquin Valley, California, where shallow ground water threatens
   continued agricultural productivity. The approach combines the use of
   ground-water flow simulation with optimization techniques to build on
   and refine pumping strategies identified in previous research that used
   flow simulation alone. Use of the combined simulation-optimization model
   resulted in a 20 percent reduction in the area subject to a shallow
   water table over that identified by use of the simulation model alone.
   The simulation-optimization model identifies increasingly more effective
   pumping strategies for control of the water table as the complexity of
   the problem increases; that is, as the number of subareas in which
   pumping is to be managed increases, the simulation-optimization model is
   better able to discriminate areally among subareas to determine optimal
   pumping locations.
   The simulation-optimization approach provides an improved understanding
   of controls on the ground-water flow system and management alternatives
   that can be implemented in the valley. In particular, results of the
   simulation-optimization model indicate that optimal pumping strategies
   are constrained by the existing distribution of wells between the
   semiconfined and confined zones of the aquifer, by the distribution of
   sediment types (and associated hydraulic conductivities) in the western
   valley, and by the historical distribution of pumping throughout the
   western valley.}},

Abstract = {{Voluminous geoscientific data related to various ground-water parameters
   provide enormous scope for using the Geographic Information System (GIS)
   to draw meaningful conclusions on the ground-water propsects of an area.
   To demonstrate the efficacy of the GIS for ground-water studies,
   information on the parameters controlling ground water such as
   lithology, geomorphology, structure, and recharge condition of West
   Godavari district were analyzed using ARC/INFO GIS, Existing maps and
   records were used as data, An evaluation of ground-water potential and
   generation of a map showing three major hydrogeological conditions with
   distinct ground-water prospects which would serve as a basic tool in the
   exploitation of ground-water resources of the district has resulted, The
   study has also revealed that the GIS techniques are time/cost-effective
   and can be employed successfully in the planning stages of a
   ground-water exploration programme. In addition, the GIS data generated
   for the study of ground-water prospects can be updated and used for the
   planning and management of ground-water resources of the district.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study using various geophysical techniques in
   unconsolidated sediments where shallow faulting is probable and most
   likely affects ground-water flow. Wenner and dipole-dipole resistivity,
   ground penetrating radar (GPR), and high resolution reflection seismic
   data are compared with cone penetrometer (CPT) information, existing
   monitoring well data and models of anticipated fault styles, The results
   of this study suggest that (1) the CPT study, combined with monitoring
   well data may suggest that discontinuities in corrrelatable zones
   indicate that faulting is present; (2) the addition of Wenner and
   dipole-dipole data may further suggest that offset zones exist in the
   shallow subsurface but make it difficult to map specific faults; (3) the
   high resolution seismic data will image faults to within a few meters of
   the surface but cannot identify faulting on the scale of our models; (4)
   offset 100 MHz and 200 MHz common mid-point (CMP) GPR will image
   features that may be fault planes and strands similar to the models; and
   (5) the combination of all the tools in this study, particularly the GPR
   and seismic, may allow for the mapping of small-scale, shallow faults in
   unconsolidated sediments that affect ground-water flow.}},

Abstract = {{Cavity wells are shallow wells without strainers and are installed in
   confined aquifers. These wells are commonly installed in alluvial tracts
   in the Indian subcontinent, and can be used as discharge as well as
   recharge wells. However, during recharge, the value of aquifer
   parameters may change, This study was undertaken to address these
   changes. A cavity well was developed in a simulated circular sand tank
   model of a confined aquifer. The cavity thus developed was observed to
   be a part of a hemisphere, An analytical solution of the hydraulics of
   this cavity well was developed. The well was initially discharged and
   then recharged at various rates, and experimental data on drawdown and
   rise of head were collected. Aquifer parameters were calculated by
   substituting these data in the analytical solution. It was observed that
   during recharge through the well, the hydraulic conductivity and
   specific storage coefficient of the aquifer decreased by 15\% and 13\%,
   respectively in relation to those of discharge. Also, the aquifer
   parameters were found to be least affected with the change in rate of
   recharge or discharge.}},

Abstract = {{The specific criteria for design of systems for the remediation of
   contaminated ground water can affect the cost, configuration, and
   feasibility of the remedial system. Two important design criteria are
   the degree of remediation required, as measured by water concentration,
   and the time by which compliance must be achieved, In this paper the
   impact of these criteria on remedial design is studied for a
   hypothetical pump-and-treat remedial system applied to a simplified
   model of a large organic solvents plume in Tucson, Arizona. The analysis
   is performed by combining two-dimensional numerical flow and transport
   modeling with nonlinear optimization, The use of optimization provides a
   means of systematically varying design criteria in an experimental
   framework, Based on the data for this site? variation of the
   concentration standard over one order of magnitude can affect the
   optimal cost by as much as 220\%. Change in the time to achieve
   compliance over less than one order of magnitude can affect optimal cost
   by as much as 175\% and in some cases can produce problems which are
   infeasible due to physical or technical limitations, Under some
   conditions, a time to achieve compliance can be identified which has
   minimum cost, Changes in the design criteria are also shown to have
   significant impact on the distribution of steady pumping rates among the
   individual wells.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas sp, strain KC is a denitrifying bacterium that, under
   iron-limited conditions and in the presence of sufficient quantities of
   growth substrate, rapidly transforms carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) to
   carbon dioxide and nonvolatile products without production of
   chloroform, Bench-scale laboratory methods were used to evaluate the
   feasibility of bioaugmentation with strain KC to remediate aquifer
   materials from an aquifer of documented CCl4 contamination at
   Schoolcraft, Michigan. Nine glass columns packed with uncontaminated
   aquifer materials from the site were used to simulate aquifer
   conditions, Columns were alternately exchanged with ground water from
   the site in a rapid (20-30 minute) displacement of the pore fluid, then
   incubated under static conditions for a period of days to weeks, The
   exchange and incubation procedure continued until CCl4 removal began to
   plateau, indicating equilibration of the sorbed CCl4 with CCl4 in the
   pore fluid, Information obtained during this period was used to evaluate
   porosity (total and effective) and CCl4 sorption, In subsequent
   exchanges, base, acetate, and phosphorus were added to the exchange
   fluids to create conditions favorable for growth of strain KC and
   expression of its CCl4 transformation activity (niche adjustment). Three
   columns were inoculated with strain KC; three were not inoculated; and
   three were chemically disinfected with thimersol. Strain KC was
   transported more rapidly than the average linear velocity of the
   exchange fluids in the inoculated columns, Protein levels measured in
   the effluent of the inoculated columns during subsequent exchanges
   indicated that niche adjustment enabled rapid growth and colonization of
   the aquifer solids by strain KC. Little or no protein was detected in
   the effluent of uninoculated columns. CCl4 mass balances on the
   inoculated, noninoculated, and chemically disinfected columns indicated
   that niche adjustment and inoculation with strain KC created conditions
   favorable for CCl4 removal from the aquifer solids, Up to 70\% removal
   of soluble CCl4 (30-50 mu g/l) occurred in inoculated columns over a
   period of seven to nine days.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents mr optimization analysis of the remedial pumping
   design for a contaminated aquifer located in Elmira Ontario, Canada. The
   remediation task presented in the paper is to remove two ground-writer
   contaminant species, NDMA (N-nitrosodimethylamine) and chlorobenzene to
   such extent that the specified ground-water quality standards are met.
   The contaminants, NDMA and chlorobenzene, have different initial plume
   configurations and retardation characteristics. The required quality
   standard for NDMA is five orders of magnitude smaller than the initial
   peak concentration. The objective is to minimize total pumping and the
   constraints incorporate ground-water quality requirements on the maximum
   and the spatially averaged residual concentrations, with contaminant
   source control being considered. On the combination of simulation and
   optimization, the results of this study indicate that the performance of
   an optimization algorithm based on gradient search is controled by the
   specified cleanup levels, and that contaminant concentrations can be
   nonconvex and nonsmooth for some pumping schemes.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{12-18}},

Abstract = {{Use of the specific capacity of a pumping well to predict aquifer
   transmissivity is desirable due to the cost of pumping tests and the
   availability of specific capacity measurements. The geostatistical
   technique of cokriging is a method of incorporating the spatial
   variability of a correlated variable (e.g., specific capacity) in
   estimating: or related undersampled variable (e.g., transmissivity).
   This study examines the reliability of cokriging transmissivity
   estimates using a data set of 215 pairs Of transmissivity and specific
   capacity. Subsets of pairs of transmissivity and specific capacity were
   selected and cokriged to estimate transmissivity at the remaining well
   locations. The estimates of transmissivity were then compared to actual
   measurements of transmissivity. The same subsets of pairs were used to
   estimate transmissivity with loglinear regression of transmissivity on
   specific capacity and ordinary kriging of transmissivity done.
   Comparison of these three methods indicates the number of wells with
   both transmissivity and specific capacity data necessary to obtain
   improvement in transmissivity estimates with cokriging over the simpler
   regression and kriging methods. The results show that significant
   improvement in the transmissivity estimate is obtained by cokriging with
   50 or more pairs of transmissivity and specific capacity, and that
   loglinear regression is superior when less than 30 pairs are available.
   With between 30 and 50 pairs of available data measurements, cokriging
   does not reliably improve the estimate over loglinear regression.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-22}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to briefly outline and evaluate simple
   methods used for estimating the volume of water and the time required to
   remove contaminants from the subsurface by pushing (e.g.,
   `'pump-and-treat,'' `'soil washing''). The methods are based on three
   general approaches to treating flow and transport: perfectly mixed flow,
   hydraulic, and advective-dispersive. Data obtained from a small field
   experiment designed to evaluate aquifer pushing was used to illustrate
   the performance of the estimation methods. The methods based on the
   hydraulic and ideal advective-dispersive transport approaches will
   generally provide estimates that underpredict the actual time. The
   magnitude of the underprediction will depend, in part, on the degree of
   nonideal behavior influencing contaminant removal (e.g., heterogeneity,
   rate-limited mass transfer) and on the ratio of target to initial
   contaminant concentration. The perfectly mixed flow reactor approach,
   because of its asymptotic removal curve, may be useful in providing
   rough approximations of required pore volumes and times. However, it
   cannot be overemphasized that all estimation techniques are prone to
   failure as long as the conceptual models upon which they are based do
   not accurately represent field-scale contaminant transport.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality at many karst springs undergoes very high amplitude but
   relatively brief degradation following influxes of runoff. Accurately
   recording transient variations requires more rigorous sampling
   strategies than traditional methods, A pilot study to determine the
   usefulness of high-frequency, flow-dependent sampling strategies,
   combined with coincidental quantitative dye tracer tests, was
   implemented in the Big Spring Ground-Water Basin in Mammoth Cave
   National Park, Kentucky.
   Data recorded following two separate runoff events showed that the
   concentrations of two nonpoint source pollutants, fecal coliform
   bacteria and suspended sediment, greatly exceeded prerunoff event values
   for very short periods of time, A phreatic conduit segment, calculated
   at 17 million liters in volume, instantaneously propagated head changes,
   caused by direct runoff entering the aquifer, from the ground-water
   inputs to Big Spring, A significant delay between the initial increases
   in discharge and the arrival of direct runoff, as indicated by a steady
   decrease in specific conductance, represented the time required to
   displace this volume of phreatic water, The delay showed that sampling a
   karst spring only during peak discharge would be an unreliable sampling
   method.
   Runoff from two different subcatchments was tagged with tracer dye and
   the timing of the passage of the resultant dye clouds through Big Spring
   were compared to water quality variations, Distinct lag times between
   the arrival of direct runoff at Big Spring and the bacteria and
   suspended sediment waveforms were shown through the concurrent
   quantitative tracer tests to be related to the areal distribution of
   land-cover type within the basin.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon concentrations in soil water and vapor are generally used to
   evaluate the progress of biodegradation and vapor extraction of
   petroleum contamination in the unsaturated zone. This study shows that
   changes in the inorganic composition of vadose zone water samples can be
   used to evaluate the reactions that occur in the unsaturated zone during
   such a remediation effort. Chemical analyses were completed on water
   samples collected from alluvial sediments contaminated with diesel fuel
   and gasoline at the Gallatin Farmers Cenex, Belgrade, Montana. The
   samples were collected from 7 suction lysimeters for 3 months after
   fertilization, but before vapor extraction, and then for 6 months
   following the start of vapor extraction, The geochemical reaction
   progress code SOLMINEQ.88 is used to calculate the aqueous equilibria in
   the samples and to simulate possible reaction pathways.
   Reduction in TPH and BTEX concentrations indicated that biodegadation of
   the petroleum began after fertilization, prior to vapor extraction, and
   continued after the start of vapor extraction, SO4=, HCO3-, pH, and
   P-CO2 show large systematic variations with both time and depth. These
   variations are independent of evaporation, mixing, sample extraction
   time, and soil moisture content and thus appear to be a direct
   consequence of bioremediation and vapor extraction. P-CO2 is found to be
   a measure of the effectiveness of vapor extraction. The chemical mass
   transfer calculations also show that if vapor extraction occurs alone
   removing CO2 from solution without coupling of a process to buffer the
   solution pH, large amounts of carbonate minerals could precipitate,
   significantly reducing sediment permeability. These data suggest that
   analyses of inorganic compounds in lysimeter samples can be used to
   evaluate geochemical changes during vadose zone remediation and can be
   used to improve remediation design.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory column experiments were performed to evaluate the fate of a
   series of chlorinated and nonchlorinated organic contaminants in Rhine
   sediment and in sediment from the infiltration area of the Municipal
   Water Works of Amsterdam, near Zandvoort, The Netherlands, Columns were
   operated under aerobic, denitrifying, and methanogenic conditions. All
   nonchlorinated and few chlorinated compounds were aerobically
   transformed. Of the compounds tested under denitrifying conditions, only
   1,2-dichloro-4-nitrobenzene was partially transformed. Methanogenic
   conditions favored the transformation of chlorinated substances by
   reductive dechlorination. Toluene was the only nonhalogenated compound
   that was transformed under methanogenic conditions. Steady-state
   effluent concentrations after biotransformation were at least 10 times
   lower than the drinking water limit of 1 mu g/l, except in the case of
   1,2,4-trichlorobenzene which had a steady-state effluent concentration
   of 2.6 mu g/l. Steady-state effluent concentrations did not depend on
   the influent concentration applied. Most transformations proceeded at
   the same steady-state rates at a temperature of 4 degrees C, although
   the process of reductive dechlorination was slower at 4 degrees C than
   at 20 degrees C. Hydrological calculations revealed that the combined
   action of hydrology and sorption to organic matter in the infiltration
   system can reduce the concentrations of 2 week pulses of polar and
   nonpolar contaminants by at least 80 and 95\%, respectively. There was a
   good qualitative agreement between removals observed in column
   experiments and in the dune infiltration area.}},

Abstract = {{A method for monitoring water flow and solute transport through the
   unsaturated zone is of crucial necessity for early detection of threats
   to ground water. A method developed by Ukrainian hydrogeologists in the
   1970s involves a borehole of a large enough diameter for a person to
   enter, that provides the possibility of installing monitoring equipment,
   and enables collecting undisturbed sediment blocks and samples of pore
   water and gas. Practically, tensiometers and vacuum lysimeters are
   installed at various levels in the borehole walls. They provide high
   quality sampling and measurements, and enable determining parameters of
   unsaturated water flow and solute transport and their temporal and
   spatial variability.
   The method was tested at several locations. Selected results from two
   sites, showing the temporal and spatial distributions of capillary
   pressure and solute concentrations, are presented. The results exhibit
   the difference between lateral variation in water flow and solute
   transport characteristics. The accuracy and representativeness of the
   measurements were tested against the mutual interaction between the
   various instruments installed in the borehole walls. Monitoring using
   the large-diameter boreholes provides the possibility of early detection
   of threats to ground water under areal contamination inputs, and of
   quantitative prediction of its future trends.}},

Abstract = {{Slug interference responses within unconfined aquifers are characterized
   by an initial wave or `'hump,'' which is followed by a fiat transitional
   plateau region and then by a declining, recessional limb, segment. The
   shape and amplitude of the initial wave are primarily controlled by the
   elastic characteristics (i.e., S) and degree of anisotropy within the
   aquifer, while transmissivity is the principal parameter affecting the
   transmission (i.e., arrival time) of the slug interference response.
   Wellbore storage and delayed-yield effects tend to attenuate the test
   response. The transitional and late-time recessional segments are
   significantly influenced by the aquifer's specific yield. In addition,
   test well/aquifer relationships, e.g., observation well distance,
   aquifer thickness, and wed depth/aquifer penetration, also strongly
   affect slug interference characteristics. The sensitivity of the
   propagated response to test well/aquifer relationships indicates that
   slug interference tests can be designed to maximize the expected
   response for aquifer property characterization.}},

Abstract = {{A chemical barrier is a permeable zone of reactive materials emplaced in
   the subsurface to remove ground-water contaminants while allowing clean
   ground water to pass through, Because dissolved ferric chloride
   hydrolyzes to amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide when it contacts calcite
   (CaCO3), it may be viable to emplace a zone of amorphous amorphous
   ferric oxyhydroxide (an absorbent for U, Mo, and other inorganic
   contaminants) into calcite-bearing geologic units by injecting ferric
   chloride through wells. For a chemical barrier to be successful, it must
   remain permeable and must be immobile.
   This investigation monitored chemical compositions, hydraulic:
   conductivity, and iron mobility in laboratory columns and in a
   two-dimensional tank to determine the viability of injecting ferric
   chloride to form an amorphous ferric: oxyhydroxide chemical barrier, We
   introduced a ferric chloride solution (1,345 mg/l {[}0.024 m] Fe) to
   calcite-bearing alluvial gravel to form a chemical barrier of amorphous
   ferric oxyhydroxide, followed by solutions contaminated with U and Mo.
   The simulated chemical barriers decreased U and Mo concentrations to
   less than 0.05 mg/l(2.1 X 10(-7) m) and 0.01 (1.0 X 10(-7) m),
   respectively; however, the breakthrough front is spread out with
   concentrations increasing to more than regulatory guideline values
   sooner than predicted. The hydraulic conductivity of calcite-bearing
   alluvial gravel decreased substantially during ferric chloride
   introduction because of the formation of carbon dioxide but increased to
   within factors of 1 to 5 of the original value as synthetic ground water
   flowed through the system, Amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide that formed in
   these experiments remained immobile at flow rates exceeding those
   typical of ground water, These laboratory results, in conjunction with
   site-specific characterization data, can be used to design chemical
   barriers emplaced by injection of ferric chloride.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity in layered aquifer
   systems commonly is needed for model simulations of ground-water flow
   and transport. In previous studies, time-drawdown data or flowmeter data
   were used individually, but not in combination, to estimate hydraulic
   conductivity. In this study, flowmeter data and time-drawdown data
   collected from al long-screened production well and nearby monitoring
   wens are combined to estimate the vertical distribution of hydraulic
   conductivity in a complex multilayer coastal aquifer system. Flowmeter
   measurements recorded as a function of depth delineate nonuniform inflow
   to the wellbore, and this information is used to better discretize the
   vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity using analytical and
   numerical methods. The tine-drawdown data complement the flowmeter data
   by giving insight into the hydraulic response of aquitards when now
   rates within the wellbore are below the detection limit of the
   flowmeter. The combination of these field data allows for the testing of
   alternative conceptual model of radial flow to the wellbore.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of 40 trace elements and other constituents in ground
   water from springs in Death Valley National Park were measured to
   investigate whether trace element composition of the ground water can be
   related to the aquifer materials. Samples from these springs were
   analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for
   the trace elements and by ion chromatography (IC) for the major anions.
   A Principal Component Analysis was performed on the data set. Surprise
   and Scotty's Springs formed one group; Texas, Nevares, and Travertine
   Springs formed another group; and Mesquite Springs did not group with
   any of tbe others, Scotty's and Surprise Spring issued from volcanic
   rocks; Texas, Nevares, and Travertine discharge from carbonate rocks;
   and Mesquite Spring is located in alluvial basin-fill deposits. The
   first three components in each Principal Component Analysis accounted
   for approximately 95\% of the variance in the data set. The Principal
   Component Analysis suggests that ground water inherits its trace element
   composition from the rocks or aquifer material with which it has
   interacted and may be used for the purpose of identifying ground-water
   movement and source.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated ground-water management model is formulated as a
   multivariable constrained nonlinear optimization problem. To simulate
   the physical and chemical processes occurring within a leaky confined
   aquifer system, the finite-difference forms of the now and transport
   equations are embedded in the management model. The Hooke-Jeeves method,
   a nonlinear programming technique, in conjunction with the exterior
   penalty function method is used to solve this management model. The
   suitability and capability of this method to solve the management
   problems for study areas of different sizes and different numbers of
   management periods are demonstrated. The performance evaluation of this
   proposed methodology establishes its potential applicability for the
   solutions of different kinds of ground-water management problems. The
   developed methodology also demonstrates the suitability of the embedding
   technique to solve a dimensionally large nonlinear ground-water
   management problem. The proposed methodology does not require the
   linking of simulation and optimization models externally. It is shown
   that global optimality of obtained solutions is dependent on the
   extensive identification of local optimal solutions and the accuracy in
   prescribed aquifer characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Boreholes in an interbedded mad fractured sandstone/mudstone Karoo
   aquifer were classified according to their position relative to
   structural features identified on a photogeologic map. The yields of
   boreholes located adjacent to dolerite intrusions, or on the limbs of
   folds where changes in bedding dip occur, were found to he significantly
   higher than the yields of boreholes located where no structural
   deformation could be observed. No statistical difference was found
   between the yields of boreholes located adjacent to faults or along fold
   axes and those in undeformed sections. No significant correlation exists
   between yield and saturated depth penetrated, suggesting that borehole
   productivity is primarily dependent on the permeability of intercepted
   fractures rather than on borehole depth. Yields from boreholes located
   in higher order catchments were also considerably greater than yields in
   first and second order catchments. Yield probability curves halve been
   derived for the different structural features identified. These shaw
   that locating boreholes adjacent to dolerite intrusions or changes in
   bedding dip significantly increases the probability of obtaining a high
   yielding borehole. The identification of these features ham air photos,
   therefore provides an economical means of locating boreholes without
   expensive geophysical surveys.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed hydrologic and water-chemistry data were collected that
   document the movement of bank-storage water during March 7-April 17,
   1990, in an alluvial aquifer adjacent to the Cedar River, Iowa.
   Hydrologic data included 745 daily ground-water-level measurements from
   27 observation wells. Water-chemistry data indicate that bank-storage
   water had smaller specific conductance and larger concentration of
   atrazine than ambient ground water, To quantify the movement of the
   bank-storage water, a two-dimensional ground-water flow model was
   constructed, and the resulting calibrated model accurately simulated
   observed conditions. Analysis of water chemistry and model results
   indicate that a 2-meter rise in the river stage caused bank-storage
   water to move horizontally at least 30 meters into the aquifer and
   vertically about 4 meters below the river bottom, whereas the remaining
   30 percent moved laterally through the riverbank. The model also showed
   that bank storage caused the ground-water flux to the river to increase
   by a factor of five during the first three weeks of base flow after
   runoff and that it required about five weeks for bank-storage water to
   discharge from the alluvial aquifer after the peak river stage. These
   results quantitatively demonstrate the importance of bank storage as a
   source of recharge to the alluvial aquifer and as a source of water to
   the river during early base-flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Phase diagrams can be used to select surfactant solutions for diesel
   dissolution and extraction in contaminated aquifers. They indicate the
   active matter concentrations which can be injected into an aquifer, Due
   to surfactant precipitation or fine particles dispersion in sediments,
   surfactant solutions concentration greater than 5\% and less than their
   solubility limit can be used for injections, Surfactant solution effects
   on interfacial tension (IFT) are consistent with predictions from phase
   diagrams, For similar active matter concentrations, IFT are lower for
   surfactant solutions that dissolve more diesel, IFT values between
   equilibrated diesel and surfactant solutions and observation of the
   oil-in-water microemulsions in column effluents confirm that
   solubilization of oil can occur in a Winsor type I system without oil
   mobilization. More than 50 sand column experiments were done for this
   study and a good agreement is observed between diesel dissolved in sand
   column experiments (with downward injection) and diesel dissolution
   predicted from phase diagrams. However, sand columns experiments showed
   significant decrease in efficiency with a drop in temperature from 25
   degrees C to 8 degrees C (phase diagrams predict no change) and they are
   essential to check efficiencies of washing solution selected by phase
   diagrams. Optimal injection concentration of solutions decreases as the
   alcohols ratio (n-AmOH:n-BuOH) increases and as the temperature
   decreases, In columns, optimal concentration of surfactant solutions has
   a maximum efficiency of 0.4 (dissolved diesel/active matter). This
   limited performance is explained by: (1) the use of water to push a slug
   of washing solution creates dilution and thus demixing of the
   oil-in-water microemulsion in the column; (2) the limited interfacial
   area between diesel and washing solution in the porous media; (3)
   surface effects on the solid phase. Diesel extraction in sand columns is
   strongly influenced by the flow direction (up/down), the volume of the
   solution, and to a lesser extent by water salinity. Small modifications
   of flow velocity (three times faster) do not have a significant effect
   on diesel dissolution. Efficiency of diesel dissolution by surfactant
   solutions decreases as washing progresses because interfacial area
   (diesel/surfactant solution) decreases. The selection of a surfactant
   for diesel recovery is not based on efficiency alone but must also
   consider the costs of the ingredients.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of cultivation (strawberries and citrus fruits) in the
   coastal region of the Huelva province of Spain in the last 10 years has
   meant an increase in the demand of water from the Ayamonte-Huelva
   aquifer system, It has also meant the introduction of an excess of
   nitrogen via fertilizers from farming.
   The system now has two problems: salt-water intrusion in the southern
   sector (Gonzalez and Romero, 1991; Gonzalez, 1992); and a general
   increase in the nitrate content in the saturated zone, This second
   problem has led to average concentrations of nitrates in the aquifer
   above potable limits (50 ppm), reaching local values near to 400 ppm of
   NO3- (Gonzalez and Romero, 1991; Grande et al., 1993).
   This paper delineates the sphere of influence of the two factors being
   considered (salt-water intrusion and agricultural contamination) on the
   different variables studied, The proximity between both factors is
   justified for each of the contaminating processes.}},

Abstract = {{A new simple gravimetric technique has been designed to determine
   residual oil saturation of complex hydrocarbon mixtures (e.g., diesel)
   in sand column experiments because reliable methods are lacking. The
   He/N-2 technique is based on drying of sand columns by circulating
   helium gas to drag oil droplets in a cold trap (liquid nitrogen). With
   this technique, residual diesel measurement can be performed easily
   immediately after alcohol/surfactant washing and in the same lab. For
   high residual diesel content in Ottawa sand (25 to 30 g/kg) the
   technique is much more accurate (+/- 2\% or 600 mg/kg) than the standard
   analytical methods for the determination of mineral oh and grease. The
   average relative error on partial diesel dissolution in sand column
   estimated after alcohol/surfactant flooding (residual saturation of 10
   to 15 g/kg) is as low as 5\%. The precision of the He/N-2 technique is
   adequate to compare relative efficiency of washing: solutions when
   partial extraction of residual oil in Ottawa sand columns is performed.
   However, this technique is not adapted for determination of traces of
   oil in sediment or for environmental central of contaminated soils. Each
   diesel determination by the He/N-2 technique costs less than 8 SUS in
   chemical products (helium and liquid nitrogen). A sample laboratory
   drying setup can be built for less than 400 SUS which makes this
   technique valuable for diesel analyses when a large number of tests are
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-water wells are frequently used to intercept contaminant plumes.
   The conventional design procedure is to plot the steady-state capture

   method to analyze the transient performance of a single well that
   combines the analytical solutions for the steady-state capture zones md
   transient velocity held with particle tracking. Using tbe particle
   trajectories, an effective capture zone can be estimated. No contaminant
   which is outside of this zone at the start of pumping can be captured by
   the well. The use of this method is illustrated by a hypothetical
   example.}},

Abstract = {{Various lab and held experiments were conducted to determine the

   On a field scale, six different methods were tested: (1) evaluation of

   aquitard reaction test; (3) evaluation of aquifer drawdown; (4) slug
   test; (5) evaluation of vertical profiles of measured organic
   contaminant concentrations in the silts; (6) evaluation of benzene
   concentrations measured in aquifer wells. Porous cup pressure cells
   instead of piezometers must be used to measure relatively fast changes

Abstract = {{A model for delineating the relative importance of particle size,
   particle shape, and porosity, (and their interactions), in explaining
   the variability of hydraulic conductivity of a granular porous medium is
   developed and tested. Three types of porous media are considered in this
   work: spherical glass beads; granular sand; and irregularly shaped,
   shredded glass particles. A reliable method for quantifying the
   three-dimensional shape and packing of large samples of irregular
   particles based on their angle of repose is presented. The results of
   column experiments indicate that in the size range examined (i.e., 149
   mu m to 2380 mu m), the single most important predictor of hydraulic
   conductivity is seen to be particle size, explaining 69\% of the
   variability. Porous media comprising irregular particles exhibit lower
   hydraulic conductivity only for the larger (707 to 841 mu m) particles.
   For the smaller (149 to 177 mu m) particles, particle shape has no
   observable influence on hydraulic conductivity. The results of the
   regression analysis reveal the importance of the interaction between
   particle size and porosity, indicating that similar pore configurations
   for a given type of particle are not achieved at different sizes. This
   empirical model seems to provide better estimates of the hydraulic
   conductivity of granular porous media comprising irregular particles
   than selected models based solely on grain size, including Hazen,
   Kozeny-Carman, and more recently Alyamani and Sen.}},

Abstract = {{Effective evaluation of ground-water flow and transport problems
   requires consideration of the range of possible interpretations of the
   subsurface given the available, disparate types of data, Geostatistical
   simulation (using a modified version of ISIM3D) of hydrofacies units
   produces many realizations that honor the available geologic data and
   represent the range of subsurface interpretations of unit geometry.
   Hydraulic observations are utilized to accept or reject the geometric
   configurations of hydrofacies units and to estimate ground-water now
   parameters for the units (using MODFLOWP), These realizations are
   employed to evaluate the uncertainty of the resulting value of the
   response function (ground-water now velocity and contaminant
   concentration) using MT3D. The process is illustrated with a synthetic
   data set for which the `'truth'' is known, and produces a striking
   reduction in the distribution of predicted contaminant concentrations.
   The same system is evaluated three times: first with only hard data,
   then with both hard and soft data, and finally with only the
   realizations that honor the hydraulic data (i.e., those accepted after
   parameter estimation via inverse flow modeling), Using only hard data,
   the mean concentration predicted for all realizations at the point of
   interest is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than the true value and
   the standard deviation of the log of concentration is two. The addition
   of soft data brings the mean concentration within one order of magnitude
   of the true value and reduces the standard deviation of the log of
   concentration to one. After eliminating realizations using inverse flow
   modeling, the mean concentration is one-third of the true value and the
   standard deviation of the log of concentration less than 0.5.}},

   of a data point, Neuman (1990), using conventional statistics, discarded
   the low reliability data obtained by calibrating numerical grid models
   against solute concentrations of large-scale plumes. Although the
   numerical modeling data are bf low reliability, they are important to
   consider because of the very limited overall availability of the data,

   versus log(10) L for large values of L, where L is the field scale, and
   alpha(L) is the longitudinal dispersivity, Neuman (1990) used a
   different line of best fit with a reduced slope for L greater than or
   equal to 100 m. Fitting two straight lines on a logarithmic scale, one
   for L less than or equal to 100 m and another one for L greater than or
   equal to 100 m, takes care of the slope change to some extent, but
   results in loss of data points for both statistical groups. In order to
   provide a better statistical model using the available data with varying
   reliabilities, a weighted least-squares data fitting method was used to
   define a relationship between dispersivity and field scale, By using
   this technique, less reliable data points were not simply ignored, but
   rather assigned a lower weight. The linear model is further improved by
   fitting a curve through the data drawn on a log(10) alpha(L) versus
   log(10)L diagram, The analysis shows a significant difference between
   the weighted and the unweighted curves. Further analysis indicated that
   the increase in longitudinal dispersivity is practically negligible when
   the scale of flow exceeds 1 km.}},

Abstract = {{Free-product recovery system designs for light hydrocarbon recovery were
   investigated to evaluate the effects of multiple-stage pumping, delayed
   startup, and uncertainty of key residual oil saturation input data using
   a vertically integrated three-phase flow model, ARMOS. The results
   obtained from a single well recovery system subjected to a given well
   location and uniform soil properties suggested that multiple-stage water
   pumping can enhance the recovery and provide optimal design conditions
   if cost and recovery oil volume are the targets. However, if containment
   of the spill area with simultaneous recovery is the target, then
   single-stage pumping still provides the optimal design. Delayed startup
   of the operation from the initial site characterization can cause
   substantial plume movement during the lag period making predictions made
   with zero time lag invalid. Allowance should be made in the design to
   account for this time delay. Uncertainty of maximum residual oil
   saturations in both saturated and unsaturated zones may cause
   considerable differences in predicted results. Careful attention should
   be paid to obtaining these data for accurate remediation design.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Water levels measured in tests on pumped or flowing wells tapping
   confined aquifers are generally affected by temperature changes in the
   water column. This temperature effect becomes significant in deep wells,
   making direct hydraulic analysis of test data meaningless. The problem
   can be avoided by using an observation well or by monitoring bottom-hole
   pressure in the test well, but both these options are costly and
   consequently not always available. Therefore, a temperature correction
   method is proposed based on a simple model assumed to describe the
   cooling in the test well during recovery. The method is designed to
   determine the aquifer transmissivity from recovery data and to calculate
   the true drawdown during pumping. The only additional test data
   requirements are measurements of the initial and stabilized discharge
   temperatures. Despite several approximating assumptions in the cooling
   model, the method has given apparently successful results in a number of
   case studies, Although further testing of its effectiveness is still
   required, the method may prove to be a useful secondary alternative in
   many cases if observation wells and bottom-hole pressure monitoring
   facilities are not available.}},

Abstract = {{Concentration ratios of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes
   (BTEX) in ground water can be used for ground-water contaminant plume
   differentiation and source determination. Computer modeling utilizing
   BTEX soil-water partitioning coefficients and biodegradation rates shows
   that hydraulic dispersion, retardation, and biodegradation do not
   significantly modify the BTEX concentration ratios in ground water,
   particularly those of ethylbenzene and xylenes, Therefore, the BTEX
   concentration ratios are similar in the contaminant plumes that are
   derived from a common source or sources of similar BTEX compositions. In
   the vadose zone, the BTEX concentration ratios in downward-migrating
   contaminant free-product remain essentially unchanged because of the
   dynamic nature of soil adsorption and restricted natural soil
   ventilation, The only significant change in the BTEX concentration
   ratios occurs in the partitioning between ground water and contaminant
   free-product as the result of differential BTEX solubilities in water,
   In the partitioning, benzene/toluene and toluene/ethylbenzene
   concentration ratios of ground water are 3.6 and 3.3 times greater
   respectively than the ratios at the source, while the ratios of
   ethylbenzene and xylenes remain unchanged.
   The geochemical methods were successfully applied and tested at two
   sites where multiple ground-water contaminant plumes from different
   sources were superimposed. The conclusions of geochemical analysis are
   consistent with the site-specific hydraulic characteristics and facility
   operation histories.}},

Title = {{A METHOD FOR PASSIVE RELEASE OF SOLUTES FROM AN UNPUMPED WELL}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{936-945}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A new method was developed for releasing dissolved solutes into ground
   water which has application in both academic studies and practical
   efforts to stimulate in situ bioremediation, introduce chemical
   reactants, or understand Row and transport properties. The method
   involves the diffusion of solutes out of inexpensive, simple emitter
   devices which are installed in large diameter wells. Mass nux from an
   emitter depends on the geometry of the emitter, ground-water now rate,
   the imposed concentration gradient from the stock solution inside the
   emitter, and the diffusion coefficient of the solute through the emitter
   material. Diffusion coefficients are constants of a solute/tubing pair,
   and are established in simple experiments. If ground-water Row rates and
   diffusion coefficients are known, emitter geometry and stock solution
   concentration can be tailored for a wide range of performance
   requirements.
   In laboratory experiments, benzene was released at or near 1.3 mg/l for
   a total of 31 days, TCE for 17 days at approximately 4.5 mg/l, and
   bromide for 23 days at 667 mg/l. The emitted concentration of a wide
   range of solutes can be stabilized for much longer periods of time once
   the mass flux in the Row-through system reaches steady-state, provided
   the concentration gradient is maintained.
   A simple computer model was written to aid in the design of source
   emitters. The model was used to match diffusion coefficients to data for
   three solute-tubing combinations. Once the diffusion coefficient of a
   given solute in a given type of tubing is determined from experimental
   data by curve-matching, the model can be used in a predictive capacity.
   A second TCE release test showed that the diffusion coefficient
   calibrated from the model can be used to predict the steady-state
   release concentration of TCE under different conditions.
   Simple two-dimensional transport modeling suggests that a relatively
   uniform plume of solutes may be generated by emitters placed in wells
   spaced close together. The uniform introduction of nutrients and oxygen
   by this passive method may encourage more efficient in situ remediation,
   and in some situations, save time and money.}},

   landscape consists of a flat hilltop, a hillside that has a slope of
   0.17 ft/ft, and a net river valley. It includes three hydrogeologic
   units, stratified drift in the river valley, glacial till, and
   underlying crystalline rock.
   Distribution of recharge to and discharge from bedrock is affected by
   the presence of small topographic features, such as terraces on the
   hillside. Most of these terraces consist partly or entirely of sand, and
   they create localized areas of recharge to and discharge from bedrock,
   Maximum recharge to bedrock commonly occurs at downward inflections of
   the water table, and discharge occurs at upward inflections of the water
   table. These inflections of the water table are associated with
   inflections in topography because the shallow depth of water on hilltops
   and hillsides resemble the configuration of the land surface.
   Regional ground-water flow in crystalline rock and distribution of
   bedrock recharge and discharge are also affected by heterogeneities in
   hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock. Vertical heterogeneity creates
   short, shallow flow paths in high-relief terrain. Horizontal
   heterogeneity causes large variations in the size of bedrock recharge
   areas; in some cases the difference from homogeneous conditions is more
   than 50 percent.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses borehole geophysical data to calculate the total
   dissolved solids (TDS) concentration of ground water in Devonian and
   Silurian carbonate aquifers in northern and southwestern Indiana and
   specifically, to delineate the 10,000 mg/l (milligrams per liter) TDS
   boundary, The 10,000 mg/l TDS boundary as used here refers to the
   transitional zone in the Devonian rocks where the TDS concentration of
   saline ground water changes from less than 10,000 mg/l to 10,000 mg/l or
   greater, The 10,000 mg/l boundary not only defines the maximum allowable
   TDS concentration recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency for potentially potable water, but also establishes an internal
   `'limit'' for the Silurian and Devonian carbonate aquifers in Indiana
   where density differences may be important for ground-water flow
   modeling. The study demonstrated that geophysical log data can provide a
   useful means of estimating TDS concentration in areas where
   water-quality data are lacking, found an excellent correlation between
   the resistivity-porosity method and measured TDS concentrations, and
   found several anomalous areas in Indiana where TDS concentration in
   Devonian and Silurian aquifers were higher or lower than expected.
   The TDS content of ground water in Devonian and some Silurian units was
   estimated by using three independent geophysical methods: static
   spontaneous-potential, mud-filtrate-resistivity, and
   resistivity-porosity. Each method yields values for formation-water
   resistivity (R(w)), from which TDS concentrations can be estimated.
   Calculated concentrations from each method were compared to available
   water-quality analyses. Use of the resistivity-porosity method produced
   the most accurate results, To help quantify the values used in the
   resistivity-porosity method, 19 samples cut from cores were evaluated by
   laboratory analyses. The static spontaneous-potential method was used
   only where data were not available for the resistivity-porosity method.
   The mud-filtrate-resistivity method yielded poor results and was not
   used, Chemical analyses of ground water and TDS concentrations estimated
   from borehole geophysical log data (resistivity-porosity and static
   spontaneous potential methods) were used to establish areas where TDS
   concentrations in ground water are less than or greater than 10,000
   mg/l.
   The concentrations of TDS of water from the Silurian and Devonian
   carbonates were generally found to increase in a consistent trend
   downdip with depth into the Illinois and Michigan Basins; however, this
   trend was not observed in several anomalous areas where the 10,000 mg/l
   TDS boundary becomes more irregular in shape, There are also areas where
   the underlying Silurian carbonates have TDS concentrations that are less
   saline than the overlying Devonian carbonates. These anomalous areas may
   be the result of nonuniform recharge during Pleistocene time or more
   recent times, or from differences in permeability that control flow
   paths and rates.}},

Abstract = {{Seven hundred seventy liters of a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL),
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE), were released into an isolated volume of a
   completely saturated natural sandy aquifer. The release was monitored
   over a period of 984 hours with a variety of geophysical methods
   including ground penetrating radar, time domain reflectometry, in situ
   resistivity, and a neutron soil moisture probe. The PCE formed a pool on
   a low permeability layer at approximately 1 m depth and spread over an
   area exceeding 32 m(2). In its course of downward migration, the PCE
   subsequently formed eight smaller pools. At the end of the experiment an
   estimated 41 percent of the total PCE volume remained trapped in the
   upper pool.
   The PCE mass and its spatial moments were calculated from radar
   reflection amplitudes. Between 48 and 100 percent of the PCE mass was
   accounted for by radar measurements. The center of mass moved a total of
   0.5 m south southeast and 1.3 m downward. Spatial variances showed that
   the greatest lateral spreading occurred in the east-west direction. The
   results demonstrate that natural heterogeneities, even in a relatively
   homogeneous aquifer, can cause DNAPLs to spread laterally over large
   areas in the subsurface. This experiment also demonstrated that while
   the ability of geophysics to uniquely measure the presence of DNAPL is
   limited, certain techniques are well-suited to monitoring changes in
   DNAPL saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Exploratory drilling to locate new water-supply wells on Cape Cod,
   Massachusetts encountered fuel-related organic contaminants in a shallow
   unconfined aquifer. However, the plume could not be traced back to the
   water table and estimates of ground-water velocities were not consistent
   with plausible contaminant releases, and thus the source of
   contamination was not located. In conjunction with an expanded
   hydrogeologic investigation, tritium and helium isotope analyses were
   performed to delineate ground-water ages and now rates. Vertical
   profiles of ground-water age were used to determine recharge rates that
   range from 70 to 115 cm/yr. The age of water near the leading edge of
   the contaminant plume along with estimates of dispersion were used to
   estimate when the contaminant release occurred (1975 +/- 3 years).
   Recharge estimates, the geometry of the aquifer, and contaminant data
   were used in a simple mass balance model to determine both the location
   of the contaminant source and the horizontal ground-water velocity
   (ranging from 20 +/- 12 m/y to 90 +/- 20 m/y across the site).
   Concurrent site investigations revealed fuel floating on the water table
   within the area (+/- 250 m) determined by the model. The configuration
   of the water table and recharge estimates were used to estimate a
   horizontal hydraulic conductivity of 130 +/- 30 m/d. The mean hydraulic
   conductivity from a subsequent 72 hr, 12 well pumping test was 100 m/d.}},

Abstract = {{A general method for estimating ground-water solute mass transfer rate
   parameters from field test data is presented. The method entails
   matching solute concentration and hydraulic head data collected during
   the recovery phase of a pumping test through application of a
   simulation-regression technique. Estimation of hydraulic conductivity
   and mass transfer rate parameter values is performed by fitting model
   simulations to the data. Parameter estimates are utilized to assess
   cleanup times for pump-and-treat aquifer remediation scenarios.
   Uncertainty in the cleanup time estimate is evaluated using statistical
   information obtained with the parameter estimation technique.
   Application of the method is demonstrated using a hypothetical
   ground-water now and solute transport system. Simulations of field
   testing, parameter estimation, and remedial time frames are performed to
   evaluate the usefulness of the method. Sets of random noise that signify
   potential field and laboratory measurement errors are combined with the
   hypothetical data to provide rigorous testing of the method. Field tests
   are simulated using ranges of values for data noise, the mass transfer
   rate parameters, the test pumping rates, and the duration of recovery
   monitoring to evaluate their respective influence on parameter and
   cleanup time estimates. The demonstration indicates the method is
   capable of yielding accurate estimates of the solute mass transfer rate
   parameters. When the parameter values for the hypothetical system are
   well estimated, cleanup time predictions are shown to be more accurate
   than when calculated using the local equilibrium assumption.}},

Abstract = {{An automated base now separation technique has been developed and
   tested. Base flow is considered to be the ground-water contribution to
   stream now. Estimates of the amount of base flow can be derived from
   stream flow records. Such estimates are critical in the assessment of
   low flow characteristics of streams for use in water supply, water
   management, and pollution assessment. An automated base flow separation
   technique using a digital filter has been tested against three other
   automated techniques and manual separation methods. The filter appears
   to be comparable to other automated techniques in its ability to
   reproduce the results produced from graphical separation techiques. The
   filter technique is easy to use and has the added advantage in that it
   can be adjusted by the user to take into account personnel preferences
   in separation of stream now into surface flow and base flow.
   The slope of the base flow recession has been used to estimate the
   volume of water in storage in the basin above the level of the stream
   channel, the amount of recharge to the shallow aquifer, and as an input
   into water budget models. A second automated technique was developed to
   calculate the slope of the base flow recession curve from stream flow
   record. This technique is an adaptation of the Master Recession Curve
   procedure. The results of this method were compared to manual estimates
   with an efficiency of 74 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Water-quality data from 90 monitoring wells screened within 50 feet of
   the water table in the unconfined upper glacial aquifer beneath five
   areas of differing land use in Nassau and Suffolk Counties, Long Island,
   were compared to assess the effects of land use on ground-water quality.
   The areas, which range from 22 to 44 square miles, represent suburban
   land sewered more than 22 years at the time of the study (long-term
   sewered), suburban land sewered less than 8 years (recently sewered),
   suburban land without a regional sewer system, agricultural land, and
   undeveloped (forested) land. Comparison of water-quality data from the
   90 wells indicated that samples from the undeveloped area had the lowest
   and smallest range in concentrations of several human-derived
   constituents, such as nitrate, alkalinity, boron, synthetic solvents,
   and pesticides. Concentrations of these constituents in samples from the
   three suburban areas and the agricultural area generally were
   intermediate to high and had the widest variation.
   Maximum-likelihood logistic regression analysis of explanatory variables
   that characterize the type of land use and population density within a
   1/2-mile radius of each of the 90 wells was used to develop predictive
   equations for contaminant occurrence in ground water within 50 feet of
   the water table. Two logistic regression equations for the 90 monitoring
   wells were compared with equations developed independently from
   ground-water quality data at more than 240 other wells throughout Nassau
   and Suffolk Counties to evaluate the predictive value of the land-use
   variables at the larger two-county scale. The results demonstrate that
   the population density and amount of agricultural, commercial, and high-
   and medium-density residential land within specified areas around wells
   can be reliable predictors of contaminant presence. The strength of the
   correlations supports the premise that land use affects the quality of
   water in water-table aquifers overlain by highly permeable material
   because land use commonly determines the types and amounts of chemicals
   introduced at land surface. When coupled with GIS technology and
   accurate, detailed land-use and water-quality information, the methods
   and results of this study can be useful to local planning boards in
   evaluation of potential effects of development on ground-water quality.
   The methods can also be useful to hydrologists in the analysis and
   design of ground-water-monitoring networks.}},

Abstract = {{A highly acidic aqueous waste containing metals was released into
   unlined seepage basins between 1955 and 1988 resulting in the
   contamination of the underlying aquifer. To provide insight about the
   mechanism(s) responsible for the facilitated movement of several of
   these contaminant metals, ground-water samples were recovered from the
   aquifer along a 1.02-km transect at approximately the rate of
   ground-water flow. Facilitated contaminant transport was attributed
   primarily to the poor cation-sorbing capacity of the aquifer matrix and
   the soluble nature of the metals in the acidic plume. Based on chemical
   equilibrium calculations of ground-water ultrafiltrates which agreed
   with results from cationic and anionic resin-exchange experiments, over
   90\% of each contaminant metal (Cr, Ni, Cu, Cd, Pb, and U) existed in
   cationic forms in the aquifer: either as soluble metals or as sorbates
   associated with positively charged ground-water colloids. These cationic
   species were not retained by the aquifer because the pH of the aquifer
   matrix was slightly below the measured point-of-zero charge, indicating
   the variable charge sites on the mineral surfaces within the aquifer
   likely had a net positive charge. Contaminants were associated with
   recovered ground-water colloids and this association increased with the
   pH of the system. However, mobile colloids would likely play only a
   small role in the transport of contaminants through this aquifer because
   of their relatively low concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Disparities between organic solute concentration in the aquifer and that
   in monitoring wells have been observed; an order of magnitude disparity
   had been recorded in some cases. Therefore, it is important to be able
   to relate concentrations between the two media for design of remediation
   systems. More significantly, to assess the impact of leachate from a
   landfill on a downgradient drinking water well, it is important to
   correlate aquifer concentration with that in a drinking water well such
   that the true risk is properly estimated. A three-dimensional
   finite-difference flow and transport model has been applied to
   demonstrate that the disparity between aquifer and well concentrations
   results primarily from advective flow phenomena and can be quantified.
   The modeling shows that the concentration in the well is a function of
   the initial vertical concentration profile in the aquifer, the
   volumetric flow rate from below the partially penetrated well, the
   penetration fraction, and the amount of water purged before sampling.
   Under steady-state conditions, the dilution of concentrations in
   monitoring wells mag be expressed as a simple analytic function of the
   above parameters. The result from this analytic function agrees web with
   numerical solutions and field sampling data.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the risk assessment approaches being applied at hazardous waste
   sites fail to adequately account for the ground-water flow and solute
   transport processes (and their uncertainties) that move the contaminant
   from the source to the receptor. For example, one recommended model
   assumes the contaminant concentration at the source is equal to the
   contaminant concentration at the receptor. A more realistic way to
   estimate receptor concentrations for risk assessment would be to use
   technically accepted ground-water flow equations coupled with the
   advection-dispersion equation and use Monte Carlo techniques to address
   parameter uncertainty. A complex numerical model and a simple analytical
   model were used to simulate ground-water flow and solute transport from
   a hypothetical waste site to a subsurface drain using both small and
   larger scale hydraulic properties. Results indicate that the predicted
   receptor concentration is considerably lower than the source
   concentration when knowledge of the local hydrogeology is considered in
   the transport simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal karst aquifers have highly variable distributions of porosity
   and permeability. The ability to assess the volume of aquifer occupied
   by freshwater in coastal karst aquifers is limited by both the lack of
   understanding of the effect that regions of cavernous porosity and
   permeability have on the configuration of the saline-freshwater mixing
   zone and by the limited knowledge of the location of the cavernous
   regions. A dual-density ground-water flow and solute transport model was
   used to explore the effect that the depth, lateral extent, and proximity
   to the coast of zones of high porosity and permeability has on the
   configuration of the saline-freshwater mixing zone. These aquifer
   heterogeneities tend to shift the mixing zone upward relative to the
   position it would have in aquifers with homogeneous porosity and
   permeability, Zones of high porosity and permeability located at
   positions shallow in the aquifer or nearer to the coast had the greatest
   effect. In fact, for the conditions modeled, position was more important
   in modifying the configuration of the mixing zone than was changing the
   ratio of the intrinsic permeability of the cavernous zone to the aquifer
   matrix from 100 to 1000. Modeling results show that ground-water flow is
   concentrated into the zones of high porosity and permeability and that
   flow configuration results in steep salinity gradients with depth, Field
   observations of the location of the halocline and of step changes in
   ground-water composition coincident with regions of cavernous porosity
   in coastal karst aquifers corroborate the model results, In a coastal
   setting with saline water intruding into an aquifer, the effect of
   cavernous porosity and associated high permeability is to decrease the
   volume of aquifer in which freshwater occurs by a greater degree than
   would occur in an aquifer with homogeneous porosity and permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The State of North Carolina designated a portion of the North Carolina
   Coastal Plain as its first and only Capacity Use Area in 1969 in
   response to large-scale withdrawals from the Castle Hayne aquifer system
   for phosphate mining operations. Withdrawals from this regulated aquifer
   require water-use permits. Applications for water-use permits require
   information on the use of the water, including an assessment of the
   impacts on the source aquifer(s). The U.S. Geological Survey
   finite-difference model MODFLOW was used to simulate ground-water flow
   in a 1,300 square mile area in the Capacity Use Area to estimate the
   effects of a proposed mine advance anticipated to require more extensive
   pumping from the aquifer. In addition, the model was used to evaluate
   the effects of a proposed municipal wellfield also to be located in the
   Capacity Use Area. The model provided estimates of required pumping
   rates for the mining activities. Simulated potentiometric surfaces and
   hydrographs for the Castle Hayne aquifer resulting from both the mining
   and the wellfield operations indicated that the Castle Hayne aquifer
   achieves steady state relatively rapidly and is impacted over a large
   area as a result of the depressurization pumping. Wellfield pumping has
   a relatively minor effect. Impacts on ground-water levels in the Castle
   Hayne aquifer at nearby communities are mainly dependent on the location
   of the active mining center. Regional-scale ground-water flow models can
   provide information on the potential effects on the flow system of
   significant hydrologic stresses and could therefore be useful in
   assessing the impacts of the stresses as required in the permitting
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Formal optimization techniques, of the kind developed in operations
   research to aid business decision-making, show promise as tools for
   controlling the high costs of ground-water remediation. A major barrier
   to the adoption of these tools in the industry, however, is the burden
   they place on the computational resources of an organization, Whenever a
   new pumping strategy is considered, a flow and transport model must be
   called to evaluate its effectiveness, Since it is common for
   optimization techniques to examine hundreds of strategies, at the very
   least, the bottleneck caused by the modeling step quickly becomes
   prohibitive, A method has been developed which uses artificial neural
   networks to substitute for the full model, permitting millions of
   strategies to be evaluated within reasonable time-frames on conventional
   computer equipment, This method was applied to a 28-location
   pump-and-treat problem at a western Superfund site. Networks were first
   trained to predict mass-extraction and containment information normally
   generated by the 2-D model SUTRA, They were then used in an optimization
   procedure to identify 250 (out of over 4 million) pumping patterns which
   met restoration goals at minimum cost. Analyses of the winning patterns
   classified individual locations as popular vs, unpopular, Sensitivity
   analyses on each location further distinguished: (1) locations which
   were strong performers under most circumstances from those which
   depended on other locations, and (2) locations which didn't aid the
   cleanup from those which were actually detrimental to it. All these
   analyses were made possible by the rapid evaluation of patterns provided
   by the neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{From a human health perspective, knowledge of Cr speciation in soils is
   important in assessing risk related to ingestion of Cr-contaminated
   soils, and in selecting appropriate remedial alternatives that are
   protective of ground-water quality. In this study, good agreement was
   found between Cr(VI) soil concentrations and the mass of Cr(VI) leached
   from columns over a range of Cr(III):Cr(VI) soil ratios (0.2-28) and
   Sigma Cr concentrations (27-290 mg/kg). In batch tests, adsorption of
   Cr(VI) to sandy soils was rapid and linear, with a Kd(Cr(VI)) of 0.2
   liters/kg, suggesting Cr(VI)-contaminated vadose- and saturated-zone
   materials may be remediated by soil flushing or pump-and-treat methods.
   In column tests, soil flushing removed 85\% of the soil-Cr(VI), while
   pump-and-treat leached only 17\% of Cr attributable to aquifer
   contamination. Use of oxidizing agents increased Cr released from Cr
   (III)-contaminated soils, but only from 1.3\% to 2.3\% of Sigma Cr mass.
   Based on Cr speciation in soils, Cr(VI) was mobile, while Cr(III)was
   retained in the soil column, indicating that reduction of Cr(VI) to
   Cr(III), and the proportion of Cr(III) in the soil, will constrain
   remedial efficiency. Reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and subsequent
   precipitation of CrxFe1-x(OH)(3), occurred in a Cr(VI)-contaminated soil
   augmented with Fe+2, resulting in < 0.01 mg/l Cr in the supernatant,
   suggesting that in situ Cr fixation may mitigate Cr-contaminated ground
   water.}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic conductivity of five stratigraphic units in a carbonate
   aquifer has been measured with slug, pressure, and pumping tests, and
   with two calibrated digital models. The effective test radii range from
   less than one to greater than 10,000 meters. On log-log plots hydraulic
   conductivity increases approximately linearly with test radius to a
   range between 20 and 220 meters, but thereafter, it is constant with
   scale.
   The increase ire magnitude of hydraulic conductivity is similar to
   scaling effects reported at seven additional sites in a variety of
   geologic media. Moreover, the increase in magnitude correlates with an
   increase in variance of log-hydraulic conductivity measured at
   successively greater separation distances.
   The rate of increase in both parameters, and particularly the range,
   have characteristic values for different pore systems. The larger ranges
   are consistently present in units with greater secondary porosity.
   Therefore, scaling effects provide a qualitative measure of the relative
   importance of secondary and primary permeability, and they can
   potentially be used to distinguish the dominant type of pore system.}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification can be confirmed by the presence of excess N-2 as
   indicated by measurement of argon and nitrogen. Previously reported
   Ar/N-2 ratios in ground water have been measured by static gas mass
   spectrometry, quadrupole mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography. The
   detector geometry and flared flight tube of the VG Optima isotope ratio
   mass spectrometer (IRMS) were determined to be fortuitously engineered
   for the simultaneous and highly precise measurement of Ar+ (mass 40) and
   N-2(+) (mass 28). Certified gas mixtures containing known Ar/N-2 ratios
   were analyzed to assess instrument accuracy. A preparation system for
   the extraction and purification of Ar and N-2 from water samples was
   developed and tested. delta(Ar/N-2) values for prepared air-saturated
   water (ASW) samples (24 degrees C) averaged +1149 + 8 parts per thousand
   and did not significantly differ from the predicted value relative to
   atmospheric Ar/N-2 of +1144 parts per thousand (p < 0.001). The
   delta(Ar/N-2) from in situ microcosms averaged +1280 +/- 22 parts per
   thousand versus atmospheric Ar/N-2 and approximated the expected level
   for ASW of +1218 at 12 degrees C. Much lower delta(Ar/N-2) values were
   measured in 18 ground-water samples collected from a site where
   denitrification had previously been documented. Samples collected from a
   site where conditions indicate little or no denitrification have
   delta(Ar/N-2) values close to those for ASW.}},

Abstract = {{The extent of potential aquifer dewatering resulting from underground
   longwall mining is determined through application of a nonlinear
   finite-element model. The model represents the form of the body strain
   field that accompanies mining-induced subsidence, and uses strain
   magnitudes to define the modified hydraulic conductivity field. The
   model is applied to test the sensitivity of the induced strain field to
   ground surface topography. The location and extent of three
   characteristic zones of conductivity enhancement are defined,
   representing gravitational detachment above the panel, shear failure
   above the abutment, and extensile deformation at the ground surface.
   Correspondingly, well completion locations are ranked with their
   potential for dewatering representing relatively high potential in
   upland areas and relatively low potential in valley base locations.
   These results amplify and offer a phenomenological explanation of
   observational data. Modeling results are compared with several
   documented studies in the Appalachian coal fields and favorable
   agreement achieved.}},

   investigated in terms of pumping tests conducted in a large-diameter
   well. It is concluded that the well storage reduces the sensitivities of
   drawdown to transmissivity and storativity, and increases the
   correlation between them. This leads to uncertainties in estimating the

Abstract = {{The transmissivity (T) distribution in the Dammam Formation aquifer
   within the State of Kuwait was investigated. It was found that up to
   29\% of the spatial variation in the log(10) to T values could be
   explained by a multiple linear relation with the coordinates of the
   observation site, whereby the log(10) to T showed a decreasing trend
   towards north and east. The deviations of the log(10) T from the first
   degree trend were kriged using the semivariogram constructed on the
   basis of the available T data. The resulting values were added to the
   log(10) T values estimated from the linear relation with the
   coordinates, to derive the most likely values of log(10) to T at
   prespecified points. The technique provides estimates of transmissivity
   in areas away from the existing water fields. The T distribution with
   respect to the structure of the Dammam Formation was also investigated.
   The hypothesis that the transmissivity of the Dammam Formation was
   higher on the structural highs could not be substantiated, mostly
   because not enough data were available from such areas.}},

Abstract = {{Maps of cave passageways in the outcrop area of the uplifted Madison
   Limestone in the Black Hills, South Dakota, show that principal cavern
   development is oriented in the major direction of ground-water flow,
   roughly radial to the Black Hills, Fracture-trace analysis and
   measuremnt of joints in the Wind Cave area show that these orientations
   coincide with cave passageways. Aquifer testing at Rapid City indicates
   that a local principal transmissivity tenser is oriented in the
   direction of cave development and along the strikes of bedding-plane
   fractures, This indicates that much of the permeability of the Madison
   aquifer is modern karst (post-Laramide-Orogeny).
   From the above, we conclude that a localized anisotropic permeability
   (principal direction of transmissivity) is developed by ground water
   flowing through fractures, dissolving the rock, and producing
   dissolution-enhanced conduits along the direction of ground-water flow,
   This localized principal direction of transmissivity can be deduced from
   analysis of the potentiometric surface, stream-aquifer hydrographs,
   mapped cave passageways, aquifer tests, fracture traces, and
   measurements of joints in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Regional and national ground-water monitoring networks are used to
   inventory and to monitor diffusive (nonpoint) sources of ground-water
   contamination. The Dutch National Ground Water Quality Monitoring
   Network (LMG) is an example of such a network, and monitors the shallow
   ground water of The Netherlands at two depths (10 and 25 m below land
   surface) in 350 wells, giving an average density of one monitoring well
   per 100 km(2), Once water-quality changes have been observed in time and
   space, the regional network is less suited to the study of the detailed
   chemistry, dynamics, and scale of the observed changes, because of the
   low density of sampling points.
   Two important threats to the quality of ground water that were
   identified by the regional network were studied in greater detail by use
   of multilevel observation wells along cross sections parallel to the
   direction of ground-water flow, The first detailed study evaluates the
   fate of nitrate and other agricultural contaminants in a sandy aquifer
   recharged by precipitation, The second detailed study evaluates the
   effects of recharge from IJssel river water in a sandy aquifer.
   The precipitation-recharged section consists of two
   hierarchically-related ground-water flow systems, A regional-scale,
   relatively unpolluted system, recharged within an ice-pushed ridge by
   rain water, is overlain by several local-scale, agriculturally
   contaminated flow systems, that extend from the water table to 25 m
   below land surface, Locally, denitrification by organic carbon occurs in
   or near the unsaturated tome, Within the regional system, ground-water
   composition changes over a distance of 5-6 km from aerobic infiltrating
   rain water to sulphate-reduced, calcite-saturated rain water, In the
   river-water infiltration section IJssel river recharges the aquifer
   within a distance of much less than 1 km from the river, The main part
   of the section consists of local-scale agriculturally contaminated flow
   systems.
   The varying compositions of ground water are controlled by the
   hydrological blow patterns, the composition of the aquifer sediments
   (e.g., presence of carbonate, clay minerals, and organic matter) and the
   composition of the source water (river water, rain water, agriculturally
   polluted), These controlling factors locally lead to relatively rapid
   transitions and heterogeneity of ground-water compositions, The
   transition zones are considerably smaller than the density of
   observation wells in the Dutch ground-water monitoring network, which
   limits the usefulness of regional monitoring networks for identifying
   chemically similar hydrologic zones or for effectively evaluating
   physical and chemical processes that affect the water quality, Regional
   patterns may evolve as a result of selective placement of monitoring
   wells, which show a specific facet of the ground-water quality of that
   region.
   To evaluate and optimize monitoring site information and to study
   geochemical processes in the ground water, it is recommended that
   local-scale sections be added to the national monitoring network
   program.}},

Abstract = {{The major obstruction to the effective use of probabilistic models is
   the determination of the statistical properties of unknown model
   parameters, In this paper we use the principle of minimum relative
   entropy (MRE) to determine the prior pdf, p(m) of a set of model
   parameters, (m) based on limited information. The pdf is of the form of
   a multivariate truncated exponential distribution, In this paper we use
   p(m) in Monte Carlo simulations to provide expected values in field
   variables such as drawdowns, pumping rates, and confidence limits, The
   examples presented illustrate some dangers associated with the practice
   in probabilistic modeling of assigning Gaussian pdf's as priors. First,
   such an assumption for the input parameters actually injects more
   information into the problem than may actually exist, whether
   consciously or unconsciously, This fact is born out by comparison with
   minimum relative entropy theory. Second, the output parameters as
   suggested from the Monte Carlo analysis cannot be assumed to be Gaussian
   distributed even when the prior pdf is in Gaussian form. In a practical
   setting, the significance of this result and the approximation of
   Gaussian form would depend on the cost, risk, and consequences of the
   decision being made.}},

Abstract = {{Air-pressurized slug tests offer a means of estimating formation
   transmissivity and storativity without extensive downhole equipment and
   in situations where contact with formation fluids may pose a health
   concern. An air-pressurized slug test, as discussed in this paper,
   consists of applying a constant pressure to the column of air in a well,
   monitoring the declining water level, and then releasing the air
   pressure and monitoring the recovering water level. If the maximum
   declining (or new equilibrium) water level is achieved for a constant
   applied air pressure, the slug-test solution of Cooper ct al. (1967) can
   be used to interpret the water-level recovery data and estimate the
   formation properties. In low-permeability terranes, the time required to
   achieve the equilibrium water level during the pressurized part of the
   test may be too long for practical purposes, and it may be necessary to
   terminate the applied air pressure prior to establishing a new
   equilibrium. To analyze data from such tests, a solution to the
   boundary-value problem for the declining and recovering water level
   during an air-pressurized slug test is developed for an arbitrary
   time-dependent air pressure applied to the well. For the special case of
   applying a constant air pressure and then reducing it instantaneously to
   atmospheric pressure at a prescribed time, the general solution reduces
   to the superposition of the solution of Cooper et al. (1967) at two
   displaced times. Type curves are generated to estimate formation
   transmissivity and storativity from the recovering water level
   associated with prematurely terminated air-pressurized slug tests. The
   application of the type curves is illustrated in tests conducted in
   wells completed in the Minnelusa and Madison aquifers near Rapid City
   and Spearfish, South Dakota.}},

Abstract = {{Electric logs provide a means of estimating ground-water quality in

   resistivity-porosity and spontaneous-potential methods were evaluated to
   determine if they could be applied to identify zones of fresh water
   (concentration of dissolved solids as sodium chloride less than 1,000
   mg/l) in three potential aquifers in central Wyoming. The potential
   aquifers have different lithologies-sandstone, clayey sandstone, and
   carbonate. The two methods generally were reliable predictors of water
   quality in the sandstone and carbonate potential aquifers. In the clayey
   sandstone potential aquifer, predictions of the dissolved-solids
   concentration using the two methods differed by more than an order of
   magnitude in several cases. When the resistivity values are corrected

Abstract = {{Historic topographic maps are reviewed to locate landfills constructed
   within New York City during four time intervals between 1844 and 1994. A
   total of 184.75 km(2) (45,650 acres) of landfill are identified
   (approximately 20\% of the study area). Data are not available to
   determine the fill composition at most sites but literature sources
   indicate that municipal solid waste (MSW) has been an important source
   of fill since at least 1891. Qualitative temporal trends in the spatial
   distribution of landfills and the composition and thickness of MSW
   landfills are observed. The oldest landfills are clustered in the
   vicinity of the early urban center (southern New York County) but expand
   in spatial distribution after the turn of this century. Logs of borings
   through 10 MSW landfills show that waste landfills built prior to the
   mid-1950s contain abundant ash (coal ash is common in the oldest
   landfills) and are relatively thin (3-7 m) with no topographic mounding.
   In MSW landfills built since that time, uncombusted organic matter is
   abundant, thicknesses increase greatly (16-27 m), and pronounced
   topographic mounding is observed. Most landfills identified in this
   study were built on tidal wetlands. Fine-grained wetland deposits
   underlying the landfills and close proximity to large surface-water
   bodies favor lateral transport of leachate from MSW landfills in shallow
   ground water and local discharge to surface water. The wide distribution
   of historic landfills and common use of MSW for fill indicates that
   these sites should be considered in investigations of ground water,
   surface water, and sediment quality in New York City and other urban
   areas where extensive historic landfilling has occurred.}},

Abstract = {{The impact that created Upheaval crater in Canyonlands National Park,
   Utah, is invoked here as the source for energy that simultaneously
   caused Roberts rift. However, no temporal linkage has been proven
   between the impact and rifting events.
   Roberts rift lies between 22 and 32 km northeast of the Upheaval impact
   crater on a subradial trend. The fissure contains clasts that were
   carried as much as 1,000 m upward from Paleozoic sources into the
   Mesozoic section.
   A plausible model for both the rifting and clast movement involves
   incremental loading of overpressured fluid compartments in the
   Pennsylvanian Paradox section and attendant hydraulic fracturing of the
   overlying confining strata during the impact event. The clasts were
   proppants entrained in upward moving fluids that originated from
   overpressured aquifers in the Pennsylvanian section or materials eroded
   from the fissure walls.
   Alteration halos and mineralization along the fissure reveal that there
   was upward leakage of reducing fluids from the overpressured zones
   following opening of the fissure. The fissure infillings became cemented
   with time, thus reducing fissure permeabilities to negligible.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of constitutive data has impeded efforts to model the subsurface
   transport of organic-liquid contaminants. To help fill this need,
   functional relationships between fluid saturations and capillary
   pressures were obtained using a unique fluid-retention cell. The
   functional relationships between water saturations and NAPL-water
   capillary pressures, and between total-liquid saturations and air-NAPL
   capillary presures in two- and three-fluid phase systems were measured
   directly during monotonic drainage of a fine quartz sand and a
   nonswelling loam soil. Additionally, measurements were made between
   water saturations and air-water capillary pressures for an air-water
   fluid system in both porous media. The NAPLs investigated were Soltrol
   170(R), toluene, and trichloroethylene (TCE). Following
   the:measurements, the two- and three-fluid retention relations were
   compared to test the validity of extending two-phase saturation-pressure
   (S-P) relations to three-fluid systems. Good agreement was observed
   between the two- and three-fluid data for Soltrol 170(R), toluene, and
   TCE in both porous media. An S-P scaling format for two- and three-phase
   systems was also evaluated. Results indicate that a single multiphase
   retention function is suitable for describing two- and three-phase S-P
   relations in similar porous media; however, it is unclear whether the
   scaling factors can be predicted a priori from ratios of interfacial

Abstract = {{We assess the predictive accuracy of Glover's (1974) stream-aquifer
   analytical solutions, which are commonly used in administering water
   rights, and evaluate the impact of the assumed idealizations on
   administrative and management decisions. To achieve these objectives, we
   evaluate the predictive capabilities of the Clover stream-aquifer
   depletion model against the MODFLOW numerical standard, which, unlike
   the analytical model, can handle increasing hydrogeologic complexity. We
   rank-order and quantify the relative importance of the various
   assumptions on which the analytical model is based, the three most
   important being: (1) streambed clogging as quantified by
   streambed-aquifer hydraulic conductivity contrast; (2) degree of stream
   partial penetration; and (3) aquifer heterogeneity. These three factors
   relate directly to the multidimensional nature of the aquifer Bow
   conditions. From these considerations, future efforts to reduce the
   uncertainty in stream depletion-related administrative decisions should
   primarily address these three factors in characterizing the
   stream-aquifer process. We also investigate the impact of progressively
   coarser model grid size on numerically estimating stream leakage and
   conclude that grid size effects are relatively minor. Therefore, when
   modeling is required, coarser model grids could be used thus minimizing
   the input data requirements.}},

Abstract = {{A research borehole-geophysical logging program was implemented to
   assess specific yield, aquifer mineralogy, and water resistivity more
   accurately and economically than can be done using conventional aquifer
   testing and coring procedures. The logging program was part of the
   Ground-Water Research Project for Abu Dhabi Emirate.
   A method of determining specific yield using data from a thermal
   decay-time (TDT) log was developed and tested. This technique relates
   the capture cross section of the fluid in the invaded zone to specific
   yield. A second new method uses data from density and neutron logs in a
   program `'LOGAN2'' to determine specific yield. Results from both
   methods were compared to the specific yield derived from the neutron log
   as well as a specific yield determined by a complex analysis of data
   from a set of research borehole-geophysical logs, including a
   gamma-gamma log for density, neutron, sonic, gamma-ray, induction,
   microresistivity, photoelectric, caliper, and spontaneous-potential
   logs. The agreement was good.
   A method of computer-assisted interpretation of mineralogy was developed
   by correlating results of direct examination of the mineralogy of
   sidewall cores with data from a nuclear activated spectral-gamma log
   (GLT). The GLT log allows the mineralogy to be assessed in a
   comprehensive manner. These computer interpreted results were used to
   develop another method of computer-assisted interpretation of holes
   logged not using the GLT. The second method was applied to the more than
   50 other test holes that did not include GLT and TDT logs.
   Resistivity of the water in the formation was conceptualized using a
   dual-water model, which is especially suited for clayey aquifers. Water
   resistivities were calculated by two methods-first using data from the
   suite of logs without the GLT and again using the data from the research
   suite of logs, which included the GLT The agreement of calculated water
   resistivities was excellent.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of buoyancy-induced vertical flow (sinking) of a bromide
   (Br-) tracer plume at small injection concentrations is investigated in
   transport experiments conducted in a large-scale physical aquifer model
   containing a homogeneous and isotropic sand pack. Two-well tracer tests
   are conducted using Br- at concentrations ranging from 50 to 1000 mg/l,
   corresponding to relative densities between 7.5 X 10(-5) and 1.5 X
   10(-3). Analysis of three-dimensional solute concentration data
   indicates that the center of mass of the Br- plume was displaced
   downward as the denser tracer solution sank through the sand pack. Plume
   sinking occurred at all solute concentrations investigated; the
   magnitude of the vertical displacement increased with increasing Br-
   concentration of the injected tracer solution. The dynamic collapse of
   the Br- plume caused by buoyancy forces resulted in increased apparent
   transverse and longitudinal dispersivities. The results suggest that the
   possibility of buoyancy-induced flow must be considered when
   interpreting tracer tests conducted with anion concentrations as low as
   50 mg/l. The occurrence of buoyancy-induced flows at such low relative
   densities also suggest that the phenomenon may be more widespread than

Abstract = {{Although hot springs have been used and enjoyed for thousands of years,
   it was not until the late 1700s that they changed the course of world
   civilization by being the motivation for development of the science of
   chemistry. The pioneers of chemistry such as Priestley, Cavendish,
   Lavoisier, and Henry were working to identify and generate gases, in
   part, to determine their role in carbonated beverages. In the 18th
   century, spas in America were developed to follow the traditional
   activities of popular European spas. However, they were to become a
   dominant political and economic force in American history on three major
   points: (1) By far the most important was to provide a place for the
   leaders of individual colonies to meet and discuss the need for
   separation from England and the necessity for the Revolutionary War; (2)
   the westward expansion of the United States was facilitated by the
   presence of hot springs in many locations that provided the economic
   justification for railroads and settlement; and (3) the desire for the
   preservation of hot springs led to the establishment of the National
   Park Service. Although mineral springs have maintained their therapeutic
   credibility in many parts of the world, they have not done so in the
   United States. We suggest that the American decline was prompted by: (1)
   the establishment of The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in 1893; (2)
   enactment of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1907; and (3) the remarkable
   achievement of providing safe water supplies for American cities by the
   end of the 1920s. The current expanding market for bottled water is
   based in part on bottled water being an alternative beverage to alcohol
   and sweetened drinks and the inconsistent palatability and perceived
   health hazards of some tap waters.}},

Abstract = {{The North Fork of Long Island is a peninsula whose freshwater supply
   consists of several lenses of fresh ground water that are surrounded by
   saline ground water. A study to determine the thickness of one
   freshwater lens near the Village of Greenport used two
   surface-geophysical techniques at several sites to provide
   ground-conductivity data that were, in turn, used to estimate the depth
   to the freshwater-saltwater interface. Surveys were made during the
   spring and fall of 1989. Wells drilled during 1989 provided some
   verification of geophysical interpretations.
   Geophysical-data interpretations were based on conceptual models with
   two, three, and four conductivity layers; the three-layer concept
   produced interpretations that best matched geophysical measurements at
   all sites. The surface geophysical techniques were successful in
   interpreting depth to saline ground water. Interpreted depths to the
   freshwater-saltwater interface were compared to assess seasonal changes;
   the interpreted differences were small and within the range of error of
   the survey techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Free-product hydrocarbon which floats on the water table may be
   recovered using single-pump and dual-pump systems. The factors that
   affect the long-term free-product recovery using dual-pump systems
   include the free-product thickness as measured in monitoring wells, the
   ground-water pumping rate, hydrocarbon density and viscosity, and the
   soil permeability. This paper presents a simple model for prediction of
   free-product recovery using dual-pump systems. The model predicts the
   long-term rather than short-term recovery rates, and lends itself to
   spreadsheet calculations on microcomputers. A particularly simple form
   arises for cases where the drawdown is small. An application for
   estimating recovery from a dual-pump system is presented, and
   limitations of the model are summarized.}},

   to nine hydrogeological settings determined by rock type, and into five
   hydrogeological settings according to their topographic position.
   Statistical tests were performed to determine whether the median well
   yields of these groups were significantly different. Boreholes in valley

   that the lithologic effect on well yield may be of less importance than

Abstract = {{Time-series analyses were made of environmental tritium (H-3)
   concentrations, the stable oxygen isotopic (delta(18)O) and major-ion
   composition of natural waters from the southeastern Piedmont Province of
   Geor gia. The sampling network consisted of four fractured rock
   production wells (utilized at variable rates), one regolith monitoring
   well, two streams, and rainfall. Although the isotopic composition of
   rainfall was highly variable (-11.8 parts per thousand less than or
   equal to delta(18)O less than or equal to -1.1 parts per thousand and
   2.3 less than or equal to TU less than or equal to 125), only minor
   isotopic variation (delta(18)O generally less than or equal to 1.0 parts
   per thousand and H-3 generally less than or equal to 2 TU) was observed
   during the sampling period (similar to year) within ground water at a
   given well site. The coefficients of isotopic variation for ground water
   within the bedrock aquifers (delta(18)O(cv) and H-3(cv) < 10\%) were
   similar to those of ground water within the shallow regolith
   (delta(18)O(cv) = 5.6\% and H-3(cv) = 3.3\%).
   Ground water from the most extensively used production well was nearly
   isotopically and geochemically invariant throughout most of the year.
   Other than a 0.3-0.5 parts per thousand delta(18)O depletion observed
   during the late spring and early summer, there were few temporal trends
   and little to suggest the presence of a seasonal component of recharge
   within ground water extracted from the fractured bedrock aquifers. This
   is consistent with the H-3-modeled mean residence time of this ground
   water which is similar to 20-40 years. The isotopic composition becomes
   well-homogenized by the time ground water infiltrates a few meters below
   the water table, and ground-water pumping does little to alter these

Abstract = {{Transport of the bacteriophage PRD-1, bacteria, and latex microspheres
   was studied in a sandy aquifer under natural-gradient conditions. The
   field injection was carried out at the U.S. Geological Survey's Toxic
   Substances Hydrology research site on Cape God. The three colloids and a
   salt tracer (Br-) moved along the same path. There was significant
   attenuation of the phage, with PRD-1 peak concentrations less than 0.001
   percent of Br- peaks 6 m from the source; but the low detection limit
   (one per mi) enabled tracking movement of the PRD-1 plume for 12 m
   downgradient over the 25-day experiment. Attenuation of phage was
   apparently due to retention on soil particles (adsorption). Attenuation
   of bacteria and microspheres was less, with peak concentrations 6 m from
   the source on the order of 10 and 0.4 percent of Br, respectively.
   Injection of a high-pa pulse of water 20 days into the experiment
   resulted in significant remobilization of retained phage, demonstrating
   that attached phage remained viable, and that PRD-1 attachment to and
   detachment from the sandy soil particles was highly pH dependent. Phage
   behavior in this experiment, i.e. attenuation at pH 5.7 and rapid
   resuspension at pH 6-8, was consistent with that observed previously in
   laboratory column studies. Results illustrate that biocolloids travel in
   a fairly narrow plume in sandy (relatively homogeneous) media, with
   virus concentrations dropping below detection limit several meters away
   from the source; bacteria concentrations above detection limits can
   persist over longer distances.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of parameter estimation procedures is evaluated for a
   modified Gauss-Newton method applied to transient ground-water flow.
   Three different approaches of evaluating the sensitivity coefficient
   matrix are examined, including influence coefficient, sensitivity
   equation, and variational approaches. The performance of each of the
   techniques is evaluated by applying a common synthetic data set. The
   latter two techniques are shown to perform with least sensitivity to
   starting parameters and extraneous sampling noise. Where either random
   or systematic noise is added to the time-series data set, the resulting
   predictions become increasingly more sensitive to the form of the
   starting transmissivity vector. It is concluded that the modified
   Gauss-Newton method is attractive because of its simplicity, high rate
   of convergence, and modest computational demands, especially when the
   number of the parameters to be identified is not large.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution for the radial mass flux in a stratified aquifer
   is presented. The solution refers to a simple case of aquifer
   remediation by the pump-and-treat method using one extraction well.
   Initially, the contaminant mass is distributed between the mobile phase
   and `'subsurface sources,'' from which mass is transferred to the ground
   water by a rate-limited process. The transport of the dissolved
   contaminants is assumed to be by advection only. The results show that
   both the heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity and the mass transfer
   process have impact on the predicted cleanup times. The rate of mass
   transfer and the mass distribution are concluded to be the most
   important parameters and, therefore, the mass transfer process should be
   the prime subject of further investigations.}},

Abstract = {{In many countries a substantial part of the drinking-water supply comes
   from subsurface-water resources. During the last several decades an
   increasing extent of diffuse pollution has endangered these water
   resources. Knowledge of the changes in ground-water quality is necessary
   in order to know if, and to what extent, ground-water quality is
   endangered.
   Changes in ground-water quality can be predicted by means of models
   describing both the ground-water flow and the transport of contaminants.
   A Geographic Information System is an efficient tool to handle the
   storage and manipulation of the large amount of data needed for the
   description of diffuse pollution. A methodology to predict changes in
   ground-water quality, which is called FLUNIT, has been built around the
   programs FLUZO, NITRON, ARC/INFO, dBASE, and WELCON, and the
   ground-water flow package TRIWACO. The method runs on a PC (with 386
   processor).
   The system has been applied to a well field on Csepel Sziget (near
   Budapest, Hungary). The purpose was not so much the prediction of the
   ground-water quality, but much more the evaluation of ground-water
   protection strategies based on risk analysis and effectivity of possible
   measures. The system has been designed in such a way that the important
   information can be used with the available resolution, and that new and
   more detailed data can be added efficiently.
   Change of the nitrogen concentrations in the extracted water can be
   predicted. The resolution is sufficient for the evaluation of
   alternative ground-water protection strategies. Moreover, detailed
   insight into changes in ground-water quality can be obtained quickly.}},

Abstract = {{A range of hydrodynamic dispersion coefficients was estimated for
   fracture-fluid and combined fracture and pore-fluid now within the
   halocline of the limestone aquifer forming the surface of the northern
   Yucatan Peninsula. The coefficients are fit parameters in a model
   reproducing observed halocline profiles in a sinkhole and in a borehole
   near the northeastern coast. Fitted coefficients range from 10(-7) to
   10(-4) cm(2)/sec, of which molecular diffusion, without transverse
   (vertical) dispersion, can account for 10(-7) to 10(-5) cm(2)/sec. The
   mechanical stability of the vertical density gradient in the halocline
   dampens transverse dispersion in pore fluids and in fracture fluids that
   are transitional between laminar and turbulent flow. The dampening is
   proportional to the ratio of the energy needed for the fluid to rise and
   displace a less dense fluid to the vertical component of the kinetic
   energy of the fluid. The ratio of these two energies is at a maximum
   during the initial stage of development of a halocline and decreases as
   the halocline widens.}},

Abstract = {{Sheet piles are used to lower the water table that exists downstream of
   a sheet pile. Under certain conditions of the upstream water heads and
   sheet pile embedment depths, a free boundary in the form of the water
   table may occur on the downstream. This free boundary is not known a
   priori and must be determined as a part of the solution; to make this
   possible, additional boundary conditions need to be satisfied on the
   free boundary. Analytical solutions are readily available for the
   location of such water tables, but with the impervious bottom located at
   infinite depth and for rectilinear boundary geometry. In the present
   study, the location of the water table downstream of a sheet pile with
   the impervious bottom located at finite depth is obtained using
   Finite-Element Method (FEM). An experimental solution using electrical
   analogy is attempted to validate the solution obtained using FEM.
   Parametric studies are also carried out to study the various parameters
   affecting the location of the water table.}},

Abstract = {{A Laplace transform solution is presented for flow to a well in a
   homogeneous, water-table aquifer with noninstantaneous drainage of water
   from the zone above the water table. The Boulton convolution integral is
   combined with Darcy's law and used as an upper boundary condition to
   replace the condition used by Neuman. Boulton's integral derives from
   the assumption that water drained from the unsaturated zone is released
   gradually in a manner that varies exponentially with time in response to
   a unit decline in hydraulic head, whereas the condition used by Newman
   assumes that the water is released instantaneously. The result is a
   solution that reduces to the solution obtained by Neuman as the rate of
   release of water from the zone above the water table increases. A
   dimensionless fitting parameter, gamma, is introduced that incorporates
   vertical hydraulic conductivity, saturated thickness, specific yield,
   and an empirical constant alpha(1), similar to Boulton's alpha. Results
   show that theoretical drawdown in water-table piezometers is amplified
   by noninstantaneous drainage from the unsaturated zone to a greater
   extent than drawdown in piezometers located at depth in the saturated
   zone. This difference provides a basis for evaluating gamma by
   type-curve matching in addition to the other dimensionless parameters.
   Analysis of drawdown in selected piezometers from the published results
   of two aquifer tests conducted in relatively homogeneous glacial outwash
   deposits but with significantly different hydraulic conductivities
   reveals improved comparison between the theoretical type curves and the
   hydraulic head measured in water-table piezometers.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{The true Darcian interblock conductivity mean for vertical unsaturated
   flow, Ky, is derived from Darcy's law, q/Ks = Kv (dH/dx), and the
   assumption that flow is constant between grid centers. It can be
   expressed as Kv = (Delta x Kx - Delta p Kh)/(Delta x - Delta p), where
   Kx is the gravity flow mean, Kh is the capillary flow mean, and H = x -
   p (total head = elevation - matric suction). Plotting contours of Kx,
   Kh, and Kv in the plane of adjacent grid center conductivities, (kr1,
   kr2), shows that a component of Kx behaves like a simple weighted mean,
   Kw = w kr2 + (1 - w) kr1, where w is a nonlinear, monotonic function of
   the grid separation, Delta x. Results from a mass-conservative model of
   infiltration into dry sand are compared for substituting:(1) the
   arithmetic mean, Ka = (kr1 + kr2)/2, for Kv,(2) Kw for Kv,(3) Ka for Kx
   in Kv (called Km), and (4) Kw for Kx in Kv (called Kmw), over a range of
   the ratio of Delta x to the conductivity displacement pressure, pk, from
   0.01 to 1.6. The simulation for Delta x/pk = 0.002 is taken to be the
   exact solution. Kw and Kmw reduce the gross cumulative net inflow error
   generated with Ka and Km from 3.84 to 8.84 times. Kmw performs
   consistently better in terms of gross water content distribution error
   by up to a factor of three.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the transport of dissolved gases in ground water is
   needed to design ways to increase dissolved gas concentrations in ground
   water for use in in situ bioremediation (e.g., O-2 and CH4) and to
   determine if dissolved gases are conservative tracers of ground-water
   flow (e.g., He). A theoretical model was developed to describe the
   effect of small quantities of trapped gas bubbles on the transport of
   dissolved gases in otherwise saturated porous media. Dissolved gas
   transport in porous media can be retarded by gas partitioning between
   the mobile aqueous phase and a stationary trapped gas phase. The model
   assumes equilibrium partitioning where the retardation factor is defined
   as R = 1 + H'(V-g/V-w) where H' is the dimensionless Henry's Law
   constant for the dissolved gas, and V-g and V-w are the volumes of the
   trapped gas and water phases, respectively. At 15 degrees C and with
   V-g/V-w = 0.05, the predicted retardation factors for He, O-2, and CH4
   are 5.8, 2.4, and 2.3, respectively. The validity of the model was
   tested for dissolved oxygen in small-scale column experiments over a
   range of trapped gas volumes. Retardation factors of dissolved oxygen
   increased from 1 to 6.6 as V-g/V-w increased from 0 to 0.123 and are in
   general agreement with model predictions except for the larger values of
   V-g/V-w. The theoretical and experimental results suggest that gas
   partitioning between the aqueous phase and a trapped gas phase can
   greatly influence rates of dissolved gas transport in ground water.}},

Abstract = {{Much consideration has been given to the use of surfactants to clean up
   nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) from contaminated soil and ground
   water, Although this emulsification technique has shown significant
   potential for application in environmental remediation practices, a
   major obstacle leading to low washing efficiency is the potential
   formation of macroemulsions with unfavorable flow characteristics in
   porous media. This study investigated influences of the flow of
   leaded-gasoline-in-water (LG/W) microemulsion upon the transport of
   gasoline and lead (Pb) species in water-saturated soil columns. Two
   experiments were performed: (1) the immiscible displacement of leaded
   gasoline and (2) the miscible displacement of LG/W microemulsion through
   soil columns, followed by sequentially flushing with NaCl solution and a
   water/surfactant/cosurfactant (W/S/CoS) mixture. Comparison of
   breakthrough curves (BTC) for gasoline between the two experiments shows
   that about 90\% of gasoline and total Pb were removed from the soil
   columns by NaCl solution in the LG/W microemulsion experiment as
   compared to 40\% removal of gasoline and 10\% removal of total Pb at the
   same process in the leaded gasoline experiment. Results indicate that
   gasoline and Pb species moved much more effectively through soil during
   miscible flow of LG/W microemulsion than during immiscible flow of
   leaded gasoline. In contrast to the adverse effects of macroemulsion on
   the transport of NAPLs, microemulsion was found to enhance the transport
   of gasoline through water-saturated soil. Mass balance analysis shows
   that the W/S/CoS mixture had a high capacity for removing residual
   gasoline and Pb species from contaminated soil. Comparison of
   water-pressure differences across the soil columns for the two
   experiments indicates that pore clogging by gasoline droplets was
   greatly minimized in the LG/W microemulsion experiment.}},

Abstract = {{Field data from a large-scale ground-water extraction system at the
   Savannah River Site in South Carolina indicate that considerable
   dilution of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) occurs at extraction wells
   when compared with the effective solubilities of the VOC components (TCE
   and PCE) in the dense, nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone. This
   dilution is believed to be due to the convergence of both contaminated
   and uncontaminated streamtubes on the extraction wells studied. Thus,
   the measured concentrations of dissolved VOCs in extraction wells appear
   to be principally functions of (1) the effective solubilities of the
   DNAPL components, and (2) the dilution due to streamtube convergence on
   the extraction wells. A simple method for computing DNAPL composition
   and the dilution factor from extraction well data is presented for the
   case when dilution is the dominant mechanism that causes the measured
   ground-water concentrations of dissolved VOC components to be
   significantly less than their respective effective solubilities relative
   to the DNAPL mixture. This method successfully computes the molar
   composition of a PCE/TCE DNAPL, bailed from a pair of monitor wells at
   the Savannah River Site, using the measured concentrations of PCE and
   TCE in ground waters from the same pair of wells. The method is then
   used to predict the variation of DNAPL composition within the aquifer
   from VOC data sampled at all 11 extraction wells. Such information is of
   considerable use in choosing solvent-specific surfactants for enhanced
   remediation operations.}},

Abstract = {{Arrhenius parameters, 25 degrees and 10 degrees C rate constants for
   hydrolysis of most EPA 601/602 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), their
   hydrolytic progeny, and selected other VOCs are tabulated. Data include
   Arrhenius parameters for base-mediated hydrolysis of
   bromodichloromethane, bromoform, dibromochloromethane, and the
   acid-mediated hydrolysis of ethylene oxide which have not been published
   before. The average activation energy of the tabulated values, excepting
   epoxides, is 110,100 joules per mole, which exceeds values reported
   previously as typical for VOCs. As a result of this high activation
   energy, the half-lives of VOCs typically are more than an order of
   magnitude longer at 10 degrees than 25 degrees C.
   These data are necessary for calculating hydrolysis rates accurately
   and, thus, for estimating remediation effectiveness when hydrolysis is
   being considered for remediation. Other things being equal, hydrolysis
   rates become much faster with increasing temperature and, for some VOCs,
   with increasing pH. The hydrolysis half-lives at 25 degrees C and pH = 7
   of many haloalkanes and halogenated alcohols are less than 100 years
   (yr), many halomethanes (freon-like compounds), and halogenated
   aldehydes are less than 1000 yr, and many haloalkenes and aromatic VOCs
   tend to exceed 1000 yr.
   These data can be used to select temperature and pH conditions to impose
   on water to favor fast hydrolysis or, for branching degradation schemes,
   select the shorter lived or less toxic progeny. Moreover, these data are
   necessary to calculate the major hydrolysis progeny for any conditions.
   Also, these data can be used in forensic geochemical applications such
   as estimating original contamination composition, time since
   contamination occurred, distance to source, and whether nonaqueous-phase
   liquids persist.
   The main base-mediated hydrolytic degradation route of haloalkanes is
   induced to be dehydrohalogenation and the main progeny of these
   reactions are ethenes. Another degradation phenomenon for chlorinated
   hydrocarbons in aquifers, chemical reductive dehalogenation by low
   concentrations of natural organic carbon, is proposed and shown to be
   consistent with published literature.}},

Abstract = {{Final Creek is an intermittent stream that drains a 200-square-mile
   alluvial basin in central Arizona. Large changes in water levels and
   aquifer storage occur in an alluvial aquifer near the stream in response
   to periodic recharge and ground-water withdrawals. Outflow components of
   the ground-water budget and hydraulic properties of the alluvium are
   well-defined by field measurements; however, data are insufficient to
   adequately describe recharge, aquifer-storage change, and specific-yield
   values, An investigation was begun to assess the utility of
   temporal-gravity surveys to directly measure aquifer-storage change and
   estimate values of specific yield.
   The temporal-gravity surveys measured changes in the differences in
   gravity between two reference stations on bedrock and six stations at
   wells; changes are caused by variations in aquifer storage. Specific
   yield was estimated by dividing storage change by water-level change.
   Four surveys were done between February 21, 1991, and March 31, 1993.
   Gravity increased as much as 158 microGal +/- 1 to 6 microGal, and water
   levels rose as much as 58 feet. Average specific yield at wells ranged
   from 0.16 to 0.21, and variations in specific yield with depth correlate
   with lithologic variations. Results indicate that temporal-gravity
   surveys can be used to estimate aquifer-storage change and specific
   yield of water-table aquifers where significant variations in water
   levels occur. Direct measurement of aquifer-storage change can eliminate
   a major unknown from the ground-water budget of arid basins and improve
   residual estimates of recharge.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional air flow model provides a practical tool to evaluate
   pilot test data and estimate remediation rates for soil vapor extraction
   systems. The model predictions of soil vacuum versus distance are
   statistically compared to pilot test data for 65 SVE wells at 44 sites.
   For 17 of 21 sites where there was asphalt paving, the best agreement
   was obtained for boundary conditions with no barrier to air flow at the
   surface. The model predictions of air flow rates and stream lines around
   the well allow an estimate of the gasoline removal rates by both
   evaporation and bioremediation. The model can be used to quickly
   estimate the effective radius of influence, defined here as the maximum
   distance from the well where there is enough air flow to remove the
   contaminant present within the allowable time. The effective radius of
   influence is smaller than a radius of influence defined by soil vacuum
   only. For a case study, in situ bioremediation rates were estimated
   using the air now model and compared to independent estimates based on
   changes in soil temperature. These estimated bioremediation rates for
   heavy fuel oil ranged from 2.5 to 11 mg oil degraded per kg soil per
   day, in agreement with values in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments and numerical modeling showed that vertical placement
   of a pumping-well screen in an appropriate location could enhance the
   recovery of dissolved contaminants from a distinct depth interval of an
   unconfined aquifer. Two single-well contaminant recovery tests were
   performed for 72 hours each at Borden, Ontario in a thin, fine-grained
   sand aquifer. A zone 1.5 m thick at the bottom of the aquifer was
   contaminated by landfill leachate, One screen was located entirely
   within the contaminated zone and the other had only half its length
   placed in the zone of contamination, In both tests, concentrations in
   the effluent were initially high, but asymptotically declined and
   approached the vertically averaged concentration of the aquifer. The
   decline in concentration occurred because converging flow in the
   vertical plane caused a reduction in the thickness of the plume near the
   well; that in turn decreased the ratio of contaminated to clean waters
   entering the well screen. The field results were simulated using
   SUNFLOWPT, a saturated-unsaturated flow model with particle tracking.
   Predictions of the model successfully matched the observed drawdown and
   effluent concentration data. Propagation of simulated capture zones into
   the overlying uncontaminated aquifer waters are consistent with the
   observed declines in effluent concentrations. Two-dimensional plan-view
   modeling is unable to accurately simulate observed data at early times
   of pumping, In aquifers having stratified contamination, only models
   that incorporate vertical flow should be used to interpret or predict
   effluent concentrations from short-duration tests conducted for the
   purpose of designing pump-and-treat remediation schemes. The results
   suggest that in some cases of long-term cleanup, two screens that
   separately capture the clean and contaminated waters of the aquifer
   could significantly reduce the volume of water requiring treatment.}},

Abstract = {{The High Plains aquifer underlying the semiarid Southern High Plains of
   Texas and New Mexico, USA was used to illustrate solute and isotopic
   methods for evaluating recharge fluxes, runoff, and spatial and temporal
   distribution of recharge. The chloride mass-balance method can provide,
   under certain conditions, a time-integrated technique for evaluation of
   recharge flux to regional aquifers that is independent of physical
   parameters. Applying this method to the High Plains aquifer of the
   Southern High Plains suggests that recharge flux is approximately 2\% of
   precipitation, or approximately 11 +/- 2 mm/y, consistent with previous
   estimates based on a variety of physically based measurements. The
   method is useful because long-term average precipitation and chloride
   concentrations in rain and ground water have less uncertainty and are
   generally less expensive to acquire than physically based parameters
   commonly used in analyzing recharge. Spatial and temporal distribution
   of recharge was evaluated by use of delta(2)H, delta(18)O, and tritium
   concentrations in both ground water and the unsaturated zone. Analyses
   suggest that nearly half of the recharge to the Southern High Plains
   occurs as piston now through plays basin floors that occupy
   approximately 6\% of the area, and that macropore recharge may be
   important in the remaining recharge. Tritium and chloride concentrations
   in the unsaturated zone were used in a new equation developed to
   quantify runoff. Using this equation and data from a representative
   basin, runoff was found to be 24 +/- 3 mm/y; that is in close agreement
   with values obtained from water-balance measurements on experimental
   watersheds in the area. Such geochemical estimates are possible because
   tritium is used to calculate a recharge flux that is independent of
   precipitation and runoff, whereas recharge nux based on chloride
   concentration in the unsaturated zone is dependent upon the amount of
   runoff. The difference between these two estimates yields the amount of
   runoff to the basin.}},

Abstract = {{Azimuthal square-array direct-current (dc) resistivity soundings were
   used to detect fractures in bedrock in the Mirror Lake watershed in
   Grafton County, New Hampshire. Soundings were conducted at a site where
   crystalline bedrock underlies approximately 7 m (meters) of glacial
   drift. Measured apparent resistivities changed with the orientation of
   the array. Graphical interpretation of the square-array data indicates
   that a dominant fracture set and (or) foliation in the bedrock is
   oriented at 030 degrees (degrees). Interpretation of crossed
   square-array data indicates an orientation of 027 degrees and an
   anisotropy factor of 1.31. Assuming that anisotropy is due to fractures,
   the secondary porosity is estimated to range from 0.01 to 0.10.
   Interpretations of azimuthal square-array data are supported by other
   geophysical data, including azimuthal seismic-refraction surveys and
   azimuthal Schlumberger de-resistivity soundings at the Camp Osceola well
   field. Dominant fracture trends indicated by these geophysical methods
   are 022 degrees (seismic-refraction) and 037 degrees (dc-resistivity).
   Fracture mapping of bedrock outcrops at a site within 250 m indicates
   that the maximum fracture-strike frequency is oriented at 030 degrees.
   The square-array dc-resistivity sounding method is more sensitive to a
   given rock anisotropy than the more commonly used Schlumberger and
   Wenner arrays. An additional advantage of the square-array method is
   that it requires about 65 percent less surface area than an equivalent
   survey using a Schlumberger or Wenner array.}},

Abstract = {{A finite-element method which incorporates mesh adaptation is used to
   calculate ground-water flow and pollutant transport. The formulation is
   based on the equations for conservation of mass, Darcy's law for an
   anisotropic medium, and the time-dependent species transport equation.
   Modifications have been implemented to the finite-element formulation to
   enhance computational speed and reduce storage; Petrov-Galerkin
   weighting of the advection terms provides numerical stability. An
   explicit time marching scheme is used to solve the transient equations.
   By utilizing unstructured adaptive meshing, species concentration and
   location of steep fronts are accurately resolved, even though one begins
   with a coarse mesh. The algorithm currently runs on PC and workstation
   class computers.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed field investigation has been completed at a
   gasoline-contaminated aquifer near Rocky Point, NC, to examine possible
   indicators of intrinsic bioremediation and identify factors that may
   significantly influence the rate and extent of bioremediation, The
   dissolved plume of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) in
   ground water is naturally degrading, Toluene and o-xylene are most
   rapidly degraded followed by m-, p-xylene, and benzene, Ethylbenzene
   appears to degrade very slowly under anaerobic conditions present in the
   center of the plume, The rate and extent of biodegradation appears to be
   strongly influenced by the type and quantity of electron accepters
   present in the aquifer, At the upgradient edge of the plume, nitrate,
   ferric iron, and oxygen are used as terminal electron accepters during
   hydrocarbon biodegradation, The equivalent of 40 to 50 mg/l of
   hydrocarbon is degraded based on the increase in dissolved CO2 relative
   to background ground water, Immediately downgradient of the source area,
   sulfate and iron are the dominant electron accepters, Toluene and
   o-xylene are rapidly removed in this region, Once the available oxygen,
   nitrate, and sulfate are consumed, biodegradation is limited and appears
   to be controlled by mixing and aerobic biodegradation at the plume
   fringes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the distribution of water-bearing fractures in crystalline
   rock is an important component in evaluating the availability and
   vulnerability of water resources throughout the northeastern U.S. The
   State of Maine requests well drillers to report estimates of fracture
   depths and fracture yields for all bedrock wells drilled in the state.
   Using these data we analyze fracture-depth and fracture-yield data from
   227 bedrock wells in coastal Maine in order to understand how fracture
   locations and yields are distributed with depth. Numerical simulations
   and statistical tests show that it is not possible to infer how
   fractures are distributed with depth:fracture depths are consistent with
   several distributions, including uniform fracture density with depth. In
   order to understand how fracture yield varies with depth, we group yield
   data into 50 foot depth intervals and compare distributions in each
   interval using nonparametric statistical tests. These tests show that
   the distribution of fracture yield in different depth intervals are
   statistically equivalent. These results imply that there is no empirical
   justification for Limiting well depth when drilling for water resources
   in fractured bedrock in coastal Maine.}},

Abstract = {{Two hypotheses have previously been proposed for the source of elevated
   radon in ground water of southwestern Ohio: (1) penecontemporaneous
   uranium at the Silurian-Ordovician unconformity, and/or (2) parent
   radionuclides transported from fragments of uranium-rich Ohio Shale
   within the glacial drift above the aquifer. To further test the first
   hypothesis, vertical profiles of dissolved radon in ground water and
   uranium in rock cores were obtained at two locations immediately
   underlain by the Silurian/Ordovician unconformity, Radon concentrations
   exceeding 1000 pCi/l occurred in zones where the bedrock had uranium
   concentrations greater than 1.5 ppm, Radon concentrations of less than
   500 pCi/l occurred in zones where the rock had uranium concentrations
   below 0.25 ppm. A log-linear regression model between uranium and radon
   had a correlation coefficient of 0.82. Three aspects of the results
   support the hypothesis that tbe source is transported, although not
   necessarily from fragments of Ohio Shale, First, the high uranium-radon
   zones did not occur consistently or exclusively at the
   Silurian/Ordovician unconformity, Second, the high uranium-radon zones
   are correlated to fracture zones having a higher hydraulic conductivity
   and thus appear to be related to the zones of greater flow and
   transport, Third, the amount of uranium-radon disequilibrium increases
   exponentially with increasing hydraulic conductivity, The hypothesis of
   a penecontemporaneous source, not supported by our study, arose,when
   previous investigators conducted regional surveys of domestic wells and
   springs and found a correspondence between elevated radon and the
   location of the Silurian-Ordovician unconformity, The observations of
   the previous investigators can be explained by the fact that the basal
   Silurian is in some places a horizon of higher hydraulic conductivity
   that facilitates transport, The two most probable external sources of
   uranium would be uranium-containing detritus in the glacial drift or
   uranium-containing phosphate fertilizers spread on the surface, Given
   that the uranium was transported into the aquifer during the Holocene,
   it could not have generated enough radium in the time elapsed since
   entering the aquifer to produce the radon levels that were measured,
   This observation indicates that radium was cotransported with uranium
   into the zones of high radon.}},

Abstract = {{Total concentrations of formate, acetate, and isobutyrate varied from
   less than 5 to greater than 9,000 mu mol/l over distances of <3 m in
   ground water from a shallow hydrocarbon contaminated aquifer. Laboratory
   incubations of aquifer material indicate that organic acid
   concentrations were dependent on the amount of hydrocarbon loading in
   the sediment and the relative rates of microbial organic acid production
   and consumption. In heavily contaminated sediments, production greatly
   exceeded consumption and organic acid concentrations increased. In
   lightly contaminated sediments rates were essentially equal and organic
   acid concentrations remained low, Concentrations of dissolved calcium,
   magnesium, and iron generally were one to two orders of magnitude higher
   in organic acid-rich ground water than in ground water having low
   organic acid concentrations. Carbonate and Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide minerals
   were the likely sources of these elements. Similarly, concentrations of
   dissolved silica, derived from quartz and k-feldspar, were higher in
   organic acid-rich ground water than in other waters, The positive
   relation (r = 0.60, p<.05, n = 16) between concentrations of silica and
   organic acids suggests that the microbially mediated buildup of organic
   acids in ground water enhanced quartz/k-feldspar dissolution in the
   aquifer, although it was not the only factor influencing their
   dissolution. A model that included organic acid microequivalents
   normalized by cation microequivalents significantly strengthened the
   correlation (r = 0.79, p<.001, n = 16) between dissolved silica and
   organic acid concentrations, indicating that competition between silica
   and cations for complexation sites on organic acids also influenced
   quartz/k-feldspar dissolution. Physical evidence for enhanced mineral
   dissolution in organic acid-rich waters included scanning electron
   microscopy images of highly corroded quartz and k-feldspar grains from
   portions of the aquifer containing organic acid-rich ground water.
   Microporosity generated in hydrocarbon contaminated sediments may
   adversely affect remediation efforts that depend on the efficient
   injection of electron accepters into an aquifer or on the recovery of
   solutes from an aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Water-quality conditions in surficial unconsolidated aquifers were
   assessed in five agricultural regions in the United States. The
   assessment covers the Delmarva Peninsula, and parts of Long Island,
   Connecticut, Kansas, and Nebraska, and is based on water-quality and
   ancillary data collected during the 1980s. Concentrations of nitrate in
   ground water in these areas have increased because of applications of
   commercial fertilizers and manure. Nitrate concentrations exceed the
   maximum contaminant level (MCL) for drinking water of 10 milligrams per
   liter as nitrogen established by the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency in 12 to 46 percent of the wells sampled in the agricultural
   regions. Concentrations of nitrate are elevated within the upper 100 to
   200 feet of the surficial aquifers. Permeable and sandy deposits that
   generally underlie the agricultural areas provide favorable conditions
   for vertical leaching of nitrate to relatively deep parts of the
   aquifers, The persistence of nitrate at such depths is attributed to
   aerobic conditions along ground-water-now paths. Concentrations of
   nitrate are greatest in areas that are heavily irrigated or areas that
   are underlain by well-drained sediments; more fertilizer is typically
   applied on land with well-drained sediments than on poorly drained
   sediments because web-drained sediments have a low organic-matter
   content and low moisture capacity. Concentrations of other inorganic
   constituents related to agriculture, such as potassium and chloride from
   potash fertilizers, and calcium and magnesium from liming, also are
   significantly elevated in ground water beneath the agricultural areas.
   These constituents together impart a distinctive agricultural-chemical
   trademark to the ground water, different from natural water.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-water levels in the Upper Floridan aquifer beneath the
   southeastern coast of South Carolina have undergone pumpage-induced
   declines approaching 20 ft below sea level at the southern end of Hilton
   Head Island. This scenario suggests the potential exists for the
   inducement of recharge to the Upper Floridan aquifer across the island,
   which could affect the quality of water being pumped by wells, However,
   low radiocarbon concentrations in ground-water samples (0.5 to 1.4 +/-
   0.1 PMC) indicate that most of the water is relict ground water
   reflecting prepumpage ground-water now conditions in the Upper Floridan
   aquifer. The isotopic data indicate long residence times and
   water-chemistry evolution more characteristic of ground-water recharge
   occurring farther inland prior to the commencement of pumpage in the
   late 1800s.
   Radiocarbon concentrations (as Percent Modem Carbon) and stable carbon
   isotope ratios (as delta(13)C in dissolved inorganic carbon) determined
   during this study and reported in other studies on and around Hilton
   Head Island varied in a systematic manner, Heavier delta(13)C values
   (-2.8 to -1.6 per mil) in ground water beneath southern Hilton Head
   Island reflect ground-water discharge from prepumpage flowpaths
   originating over 100 miles away, hence a depletion in radiocarbon
   concentration with corrected ground-water ages no younger than 16,000
   yrs BP. In contrast, lighter delta(13)C values (-13.9 to -8.67 per mil)
   beneath the northern part of the island indicate recent recharge as a
   result of water-level declines, and recharge in areas off the island
   that have not changed as a result of pumpage (evidenced by enrichment in
   radiocarbon with corrected ground-water ages no older than 4,000 yrs
   BP), This suggests that the delta(13)C composition of ground water in
   the Upper Floridan aquifer is a useful indicator of mixing between
   ground waters from different sources, and can be used to delineate
   recharge-discharge patterns. This approach may be applicable to other
   aquifers of highly evolved ground-water chemistry in regional carbonate
   aquifer systems that may be receiving recent recharge. Moreover, this
   approach could prove useful in delineating the contribution of recent
   water being captured by pumped wells as part of wellhead protection
   programs designed to assess aquifer vulnerability from surficial
   contaminant sources.}},

Abstract = {{The process of attempting to model ground-water systems requires a good
   understanding of the spatial variation of aquifer hydraulic properties.
   The capabilities of the more recent innovative flowmeters such as the
   electromagnetic and heat pulse flowmeters provide the sensitivity to
   measure ambient flows and pump-induced flows. These flowmeters provide
   the measurements of pump-induced vertical flows which are analyzed to
   obtain vertical variations in horizontal hydraulic conductivity, K(z).
   With discrete areal K-values, K(x, y), and vertical profiles of K,
   provided by multiwell testing, the essential elements are present to
   produce a three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity field, The advent of
   these new flow measuring devices has contributed much to the motivation
   behind this paper.
   This paper presents the results of applying deterministic and stochastic
   methodology to the three-dimensional interpolation of hydraulic
   properties, specifically, hydraulic conductivity, K. Three of the
   approaches applied in this paper are deterministic in nature,
   inverse-distance weighting, inverse-distance-squared weighting, and
   ordinary kriging, while the fourth is a stochastic approach based on
   self-affine fractals, All of the methods are applied to measured data
   collected from 14 wells at a site in the United States near Mobile,
   Alabama, The three-dimensional K-distributions generated by each of the
   methods are used as inputs to an advective based transport model with
   the resulting model output compared to a two-well tracer study run
   previously at the same site.}},

Abstract = {{A transient axisymmetric saturated-unsaturated numerical flow model was
   coupled with a particle tracking model to investigate the movement of
   contaminants when a shallow unconfined aquifer is pumped at a constant
   rate, The particle tracking model keeps track of locations and masses of
   solutes in the aquifer, and the time of capture by the well, At the end
   of each time-step the flow model solves the Richard's equation for the
   hydraulic head distribution from which elemental velocities are
   calculated, Solutes are then displaced for a period equivalent to the
   time-step using both the magnitude and direction of the elemental
   velocities, Numerical experiments were performed to investigate effluent
   concentrations in wells with screens of different length and in
   different positions relative to zones of stratified contamination, At
   early times of pumping the effluent concentrations were similar to the
   concentrations adjacent to the well screen, but at late times, the
   concentrations approached the vertically averaged concentration in the
   aquifer, Time to attain the vertically averaged concentration was
   determined by the well geometry, initial location of the contaminant
   plume in relation to the well screen, and hydraulic properties of the
   aquifer, The results are consistent with the hydraulics of now to a
   pumping well and of particular importance, they demonstrate that
   short-term pump tests could give erroneous design concentrations for
   pump-and-treat systems. The model provides a means of quantifying
   arrival times and mixing ratios, It could therefore provide a useful
   means of designing production wells in aquifers with stratified
   contamination and more efficient recovery systems for aquifer
   remediation.}},

Abstract = {{Four years of detailed ground-water monitoring at a newly installed,
   seasonal-use, domestic septic system located on poorly buffered (CaCO3
   equivalent content (1.6 wt.\%) lacustrine silt, has revealed the
   development of an acidic goundwater plume, Acid, generated by the
   partial oxidation of effluent NH4+, dissolved organic carbon (DOG), and
   possibly sulfide minerals present in the sediment, has resulted in a
   distal plume core zone with pH values in the range of 4.4 to 5.0. The
   acidic zone, where NH4+ does, however, persist (> 2 mg/l, as N) and
   where DOC remains elevated (6-13 mg/l), is associated with high average
   concentrations of the trace metals Fe (4.7 mg/l), Al (1.9 mg/l), and Mn
   (3.6 mg/l), Attenuation of nitrogen along the plume core flowpath is
   indicated by a decrease in the N/Cl- ratio from an effluent value of
   1.7, to a plume value of only 0.5 after 4 m of subsurface flow.
   Increased SO42- levels observed in the zone of N depletion suggest that
   attenuation can be at least partly attributed to reduction of plume NO3-
   by oxidation of reduced S present in the sediment. PO43- has not
   migrated significantly beyond the infiltration bed gravel layer,
   demonstrating that PO43- mobility is limited in these sediments
   (retardation factor > 10).}},

Abstract = {{Beginning in 1990, 2,588 wells were sampled within the Inner Coastal
   Plain of Georgia in an effort to assess the quality of ground water in
   this major farm belt. The project was one aspect of an EPA-sponsored
   program to assess ground-water quality statewide. Several variables were
   measured, including pit, specific conductivity, dissolved oxygen,
   temperature, nitrate, nitrite, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, and
   bicarbonate. In some wells sulfate, chloride, potassium, iron, and
   manganese contents were also determined. Particular emphasis was placed,
   however, on pH, specific conductivity, temperature, and nitrite/nitrate
   content. Generally, pH was between 6 and 8, and temperatures were within
   a range of 18 degrees and 24 degrees Celsius. Measurements of specific
   conductivity varied, but averaged 250-275 microsiemens/cm. Nitrite
   contamination was negligible, and nitrate contamination of the ground
   water within the shallow aquifers did not appear to be significant. In
   fact, 56\% of the wells sampled showed no detectable signs of nitrate or
   nitrite contamination. There were, however, a few isolated wells where
   nitrate as nitrogen measurements exceeded the EPA's Safe Drinking Water
   Standard of 10 ppm. The general lack of contamination may be the result
   of the nature of the agricultural practices used in this region and/or
   the effect of natural denitrification.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic dry wells are reported by some homeowners in Knox and Lincoln

   which is intermixed with the granitoids of the Waldoboro Pluton Complex,
   Previous remote sensing and geologic mapping delineated marked
   northeast-trending structures in the WPC which were initially suspected
   as influencing ground-water flow for sustainable well yields, A sample
   area, Pemaquid Pond, in the WPC was studied in more detail including
   preliminary hydraulic testing of homeowner wells and ground-water flow
   modeling.
   Wells with sustainable and greater yields appear to be associated
   instead with zones of northwest-trending structures in granitoids not
   intermixed with the Bucksport Fm. Dry wells appear to be more prevalent
   amongst northeast-trending structures in areas where the migmatitic
   metamorphic rocks outcrop, Hydraulic studies, including pumping, slug,
   pressure, and borehole dilution testing, resulted in a wide range of
   calculated hydraulic conductivities, Dual-porosity flow modeling and
   geostatistical parameterization of the flow conditions suggest that the
   anisotropic hydraulic conductivity is near E-9 m/d.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions for the water flow and solute transport equations
   in the unsaturated zone are presented. We use the Broadbridge and White
   nonlinear mode) to solve the Richards' equation for vertical flow under
   a constant infiltration rate. Then we extend the water flow solution and
   develop an exact parametric solution for the advection-dispersion
   equation. The method of characteristics is adopted to determine the
   location of a solute front in the unsaturated zone. The dispersion
   component is incorporated into the final solution using a singular
   perturbation method. The formulation of the analytical solutions is
   simple, and a complete solution is generated without resorting to
   computationally demanding numerical schemes, Indeed, the simple
   analytical solutions can be used as tools to verify the accuracy of
   numerical models of water flow and solute transport. Comparison with a
   finite-element numerical solution indicates that a good match for the
   predicted water content is achieved when the mesh grid is one-fourth the
   capillary length scale of the porous medium. However, when numerically
   solving the solute transport equation at this level of discretization,
   numerical dispersion and spatial oscillations were significant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews different borehole flowmeter analysis methods and
   evaluates their applicability to a test site composed of fluvial
   deposits. Results from tracer and aquifer tests indicate that the
   aquifer is highly heterogeneous and that low-K skin effects exist at the
   wells. Borehole flowmeter tests were performed at 37 wells. An
   appropriate method for calculating borehole flowmeter K values was
   developed based on results from multiwell pumping tests, single-wed
   pumping tests, and slug tests. The flowmeter data produced 881 K values.
   The trends and the magnitude of the K values are consistent with results
   from geologic investigations, recirculating tracer tests, and
   large-scale multiwell pumping tests. The field tests illustrate that
   high-K deposits can significantly affect ground-water flows in some
   heterogeneous fluvial aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{The state-space estimation technique presented herein provides a method
   for obtaining optimal estimates of concentrations for two-dimensional
   plumes in ground water. The concentration of a plume was defined as the
   state variable. The technique uses the Kalman Biter and involves
   combining two independent estimates of plume concentrations. One
   estimate is called the process modeling data and the other is called the
   `'measurement'' data. The process modeling data is obtained from a
   numerical model. The `'measurement'' data is obtained from field
   measurements; however, for illustration in this paper it was generated
   by a different numerical model than the one used to obtain the process
   modeling data. The state-space technique produces a distribution of
   contaminant concentrations that is more accurate than either of the
   distributions generated by the process modeling or the `'measurement''
   data. An example is presented to show that the technique produces
   significant improvements in the prediction of plume concentration
   distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Specific yield is the principal aquifer characteristic needed to
   estimate the volume of recoverable ground water in storage in an
   aquifer.  Determination of specific yield can be difficult and costly,
   particularly in deep, confined aquifers where core drilling and core
   analyses may be needed to define specific yield.  A method has been
   developed for preparation of specific-yield geophysical logs that could
   greatly ease the determination of specific yields in such aquifers.
   Three geophysical logs that were investigated as potential indicators of
   specific yield were the free fluid index log, the effective-porosity
   log, and the apparent grain-density log.  The free fluid index log did
   not accurately represent conditions at the test site in central Colorado
   and may not be suitable for application in other shallow and permeable
   aquifers.  The effective-porosity and apparent grain-density logs were
   each used in least-squares linear regressions to correlate log response
   to specific yield measured in core samples.  The resulting regression
   equations have coefficients of correlation (R) of 0.84 and 0.90, and
   were used to successfully prepare specific-yield logs from the
   effective-porosity and apparent grain-density logs.}},

Abstract = {{The slug test is one of the most common techniques for the in situ
   estimation of hydraulic conductivity in unconfined flow systems. 
   Recently, a mathematical model describing the flow of ground water in
   response to a slug test in an unconfined flow system has been proposed. 
   This model incorporates the effects of partial penetration, anisotropy,
   an upper constant-head boundary, and, in its most complete form, well
   skins of either higher or lower permeability than the formation itself. 
   This model is useful in identifying conditions when conventional
   approaches (i.e., the Bouwer and Rice model) introduce large errors into
   parameter estimates.  For slug tests performed in homogeneous, isotropic
   formations that would be classified as aquifers, the Bouwer and Rice
   model provides estimates within 30\% of actual field values.  In
   less-permeable, clay-rich formations, however, estimates may overpredict
   formation conductivity by more than 100\%.  The Bouwer and Rice model
   introduces the largest error (can easily exceed an order of magnitude)
   in the presence of a low-permeability skin.  Uncertainty about
   anisotropy can also be the source of considerable error.  The
   semianalytical solution to the mathematical model described here can be
   employed for parameter estimation under conditions when the Bouwer and
   Rice model introduces unacceptably large errors into parameter
   estimates.  This solution can be rapidly evaluated, allowing easy
   incorporation into an automated well-test analysis package and/or ready
   generation of type curves.}},

Abstract = {{From a critical review of literature it is concluded that the available
   methods of analyzing step-drawdown tests produce information which can
   be misleading, inaccurate, or meaningless.  Calculation of the total
   well loss from step-drawdown tests, on the other hand, provides a
   meaningful evaluation of well performance but is not explicitly
   described in literature.  Therefore, a method is presented for
   determining the total well loss as a function of discharge with linear
   and nonlinear components.  The method is restricted to confined
   aquifers, but an observation well is not required because any reasonable
   estimate of the storage coefficient is usually adequate.  An advantage
   of the method is that it is valid for any stepped pumping pattern and
   any observed fluctuations in discharge during a step are simply
   accommodated as additional steps.  Field examples show that the method
   can be very successful and useful.  Other specific conclusions are that
   well efficiency should not be calculated because it is misleading, and
   that aquifer transmissivity should be determined in step-drawdown tests
   from recovery data in the pumped well, not pumping data, to improve
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of field heterogeneities in ground-water pollution
   problems has been widely recognized during the last few decades.  To
   address the impact of field heterogeneities on ground-water flow and
   solute transport, many different stochastic methods have been developed.
   Among all these stochastic methods kriging is the most popular one used
   by many practitioners to interpolate and extrapolate measured
   transmissivity data.  However, hydraulic head measurements are generally
   more abundant than transmissivity data.  Therefore, the cokriging
   technique which utilizes both the head and transmissivity measurements
   to estimate transmissivity and/or hydraulic head distributions has also
   received much attention in recent years.
   Classical cokriging relies on a linear predictor approach and uses
   covariance and cross covariance functions derived from a first-order
   approximation.  Consequently, it often results in head and
   transmissivity fields that can produce unacceptable velocity
   distributions.  In this paper, we develop an iterative method which
   combines classical cokriging and a numerical flow model to obtain
   optimum estimates of transmissivity and head distributions and to
   alleviate the limitations of classical cokriging.  Through several
   numerical examples, we demonstrate that this method is superior to the
   classical cokriging method in terms of producing mass conservative
   velocity fields.  In addition, results of the study also indicate that
   hydraulic head measurements can improve for our prediction of
   ground-water flow directions and paths in aquifers significantly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows that the Levenberg-Marquardt method, modified to limit
   the parameter update steps to within a specified range, effectively
   optimizes a set of parameters in a ground-water model.  In doing so it
   performs better than more complicated conjugate gradient algorithms.
   The method has been applied to the synthetic ground-water problem of
   Carrera and Neuman (1986b), which has been used previously to test
   calibration method performance.  The descent of the error criterion and
   the simultaneous approach of the parameters to their optimum values are
   smooth, both with perfect and erroneous head observation data.
   It is shown that least-squares optimization can be done effectively in a
   simple manner and that it can be easily integrated with practical
   ground-water modeling.  No changes have to be made to the model code. 
   This ease of implementation is emphasized by the fact that all modeling
   presented here was done using an ordinary spreadsheet program on a PC.}},

Abstract = {{Five methods (tidal damping, tracer, slug, permeameter, and grain-size
   analysis) for the determination of hydraulic conductivity (K) were
   compared in both upland and shoreline regions of a sandy outwash aquifer
   adjacent to a shallow coastal embayment.  The 7 m tracer test and tidal
   damping methods appeared to determine in situ K over sufficient
   horizontal scales to integrate the spatial variability of K within the
   aquifer, with the tracer test giving the most reproducible K estimates
   for the upland, 109 m/d.  The tidal K measurements were similar to the
   tracer results, 106 m/d, integrating K over greater distances (30 to 85
   m), but were highly variable due to the large aquifer storativity, small
   tidal amplitude, and irregular tides.
   The smaller scale methods yielded lower upland K estimates with the
   lowest value from permeameters, 29 m/d, only about one-third of the
   other four methods.  Estimates of upland K by both grain-size and slug
   tests were comparable, 86 m/d and 71 m/d, respectively.  However, the K
   derived from grain-size methods was dependent not only upon the sediment
   but on the method selected, with consistently higher values of K
   generated by the Hazen equation than the Krumbein and Monk equation. 
   Verification by in situ tests may be useful in removing this bias.
   Significant differences in K were found between shoreline and upland
   regions, though the relative magnitude of the difference was not
   constant:  among the four methods where comparative measurements were
   possible, shoreline K ranged from 42\% to 75\% of upland values.  Slug
   tests yielded the largest differences, 30 m/d and 71 m/d, with
   permeameter, 18 m/d and 24 m/d, the lowest.  The lower K of shoreline
   sediments appears to be the result of processes associated with coastal
   embayments and should be addressed in the measurement and modeling of
   coastal ground-water discharge.}},

Abstract = {{A hydraulic control optimization model is applied to the conceptual and
   implementation analysis of a ground-water remediation system in coastal
   New Jersey. The site is modeled using a distributed parameter
   finite-difference model containing 36,000 nodes within five layers. The
   conceptual problem is to determine the feasibility of producing a
   capture zone which encompasses the entire existing plume while
   recharging all extracted water within property boundaries in such a way
   that the recharged water satisfies criteria on its fate. The conceptual
   analysis problem is formulated as a linear program in which the total
   extraction pumping is minimized, and requirements are placed on
   hydraulic heads and gradients in both horizontal and vertical
   directions. A requirement is also made that all extracted water be
   recharged to the subsurface. The model is used for determination of the
   feasibility of the remediation concept. Details of constructing
   constraints for a large-scale formulation are presented. The concept of
   constraint calibration, using particle tracking to insure that
   constraints are producing desired results, is introduced and
   demonstrated. The optimization formulation is used for detailed
   implementation analysis of the remediation system. A number of
   techniques for modifying elements of the conceptual model results, such
   as unrealistically small pump rates, are described. The optimization
   approach is found to be useful for determining the feasibility of the
   remedial strategy at this site and for producing results which can be
   used as a starting point for detailed analysis of the remediation
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{The Analytic Element Method (AEM) of ground-water modeling was used to
   delineate wellhead protection areas (WHPAs) for existing and proposed
   wells in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota by simulating steady-state flow in two
   aquifers:  the water-table aquifer (in glacial outwash) and the
   Franconia-Ironton-Galesville bedrock aquifer.  Ground-water
   time-of-travel was used as the delineation criterion.  Ground-water flow
   is significantly affected by a buried bedrock valley underneath the
   City.  Transmissivity values for the water-table aquifer are much higher
   in the buried bedrock valley and the hydraulic connection between the
   water-table and the Franconia-Ironton-Galesville aquifers is more
   pronounced.  The Analytic Element Method does not utilize a grid mesh
   and incorporates both regional-scale and more detailed, local-scale
   features in the same solution.  This feature of AEM provided for the
   simulation of the city wells in the context of the regional flow field. 
   Separate models, encompassing an area of approximately 500 square miles,
   were developed and calibrated for each aquifer using the Single Layer
   Analytic Element Model (SLAEM) and then linked together using the
   Multi-Layer Analytic Element Model (MLAEM).  Ground-water travel-time
   zones and WHPAs were delineated for the existing wells using reverse
   particle tracking.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments have been conducted at the Borden research site to
   evaluate the widely applied soil-gas survey method.  In particular, the
   ability of surveys to delineate DNAPL chlorinated solvent sources and
   associated ground-water plumes has been investigated.  Field experiments
   indicated that dissolved-phase plumes from DNAPL pools or residual
   located about a meter or more below the water table are unlikely to be
   directly detected by soil-gas surveys.  Soil-gas plumes observed at real
   sites are attributed to volatilization of source material in the vadose
   zone and consequent formation of very shallow interface zone
   ground-water contamination that is able to partition to the soil gas as
   it transports downgradient.  The distribution of DNAPL sources and
   dissolved-phase plumes deeper in the ground-water zone may often bear
   little resemblance to the shallow interface zone ground-water plume
   above, and hence the location of this deeper contamination will remain
   highly difficult to identify by soil-gas surveys.  Field observations
   are confirmed with simple analytical 1-D diffusion modeling and the
   implications of the results to the practice of soil-gas surveys at
   contaminated sites indicated.}},

Abstract = {{A new alternative septic-system design is presented utilizing reactive
   porous media barriers for passive in situ attentuation of NO3-.  The
   reactive material consists of solid organic carbon (sawdust) which
   promotes NO3 attentuation by heterotrophic denitrification.  Four field
   trials are discussed demonstrating two barrier configurations:  as a
   horizontal layer positioned in the vadose zone below a conventional
   septic-system infiltration bed and as a vertical wall intercepting a
   horizontally flowing downgradient plume.  During one year of operation
   both barrier configurations have been successful in substantial
   attentuation (60 to 100\%) of input NO3- levels of up to 125 mg/l as N. 
   The horizontal layer configuration can be readily installed during the
   construction of new filtration beds, whereas the vertical wall
   configuration may be more appropriate for retrofitting existing septic
   systems where NO3- contamination has already occurred.  The layer
   configuration allows the flexibility of constructing the barrier in the
   vadose zone by using coarse silt or fine sand matrix material that has
   the ability to remain tension-saturated, and thus anaerobic, even when
   positioned above the water table.
   Advantages of the barrier system are that it is simple to construct, no
   surface structures or additional plumbing are necessary, and treatment
   is passive requiring no energy consumption and little or no maintenance.
   Mass balance calculations and preliminary results suggest that
   conventiently sized barriers have the potential to last for decades
   without replenishment of the reactive material.}},

Abstract = {{The Surdulica-Bujanovac geothermal region of southeastern Serbia, with
   granodiorite (Surdulica) and granite (Bujanovac) aquifers (water
   temperatures of 125-degrees-C and 46-degrees-C, respectively) was
   hydrogeologically and geochemically studied using environmental isotopes
   from 1986 to 1990. In the Surdulica system, water, rock, and vegetation
   samples from 35 locations (springs, rivers, and boreholes) representing
   all parts of the hydrogeological system (recharge area, transition zone,
   and terminus with hot deep-circulated waters) were collected for
   geochemical and isotope analyses (D, O-18, H-3, C-13, C-14). From the
   recharge area to the terminus of the system, ground-water temperatures
   and ionic concentrations increase two to three orders of magnitude:
   temperature from 3-126-degrees-C, Na+ 2.3-1127 mg/l; HCO3- 30.5-2989
   mg/I; SO4(2-) 4.8-480 mg/l; SiO2 3-90 mg/l. The hot waters, appearing at
   the terminus of the system (Vranjska and Bujanovac Spas locations) are
   the oldest, based on C-14 and H-3. The delta C-13 attains the low
   negative value of-0.4 parts per thousand for hot waters, approaching
   those in the aquifer matrix, which are in the range between-8.4 and +2
   parts per thousand. The delta O-18 and delta D values in precipitation
   and ground water indicate that recharge takes place predominantly at the
   higher elevations (more than 500 m asl) and in the cold seasons. A
   dual-porosity system comprised of fissures and intergranular storage
   controls fluid transport. The deepest flows are hydraulically isolated
   from fresh waters. Low C-14 contents (1-6 pMC) and the absence of H-3
   suggest the mean residence times for the older water up to 20,000 years.
   A O-18 shift and chemical geothermometers suggest that their base
   temperatures of more than 200-degrees-C are not likely.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the second part of a two-part series concerned with
   assessing the potential for organic chemical leaching to a ground-water
   skimming tunnel in the Pearl Harbor Basin, Oahu, Hawaii, as a direct
   result of proposed urban development.  The Pesticide Root Zone Model
   (PRZM) was used, after testing with field and laboratory data described
   in the companion paper, to make long-term predictions of the movement of
   chlorpyrifos, diazinon, metribuzin, and nitrate under various recharge
   scenarios.  The PRZM simulations revealed that, with the exception of
   chlorpyrifos, detectable levels of all the chemicals considered in this
   study may leach through the unsaturated zone to the water table from
   where they may eventually migrate to the skimming tunnel.  The simulated
   concentrations in leachate reaching the water table were sufficiently
   low, considering subsequent mixing in the ground water, to suggest no
   adverse health effects.  The reliability of the simulated results are
   laced with enough uncertainty, however, to suggest the need for
   monitoring for diazinon, metribuzin, and nitrate, if development does
   proceed.  The methodology presented in this series is a first attempt at
   establishing a protocol for using numerical modeling, supported by field
   and laboratory measurements to aid in land-use change consideration in
   Hawaii when nonpoint ground-water contamination from organic chemicals
   is of concern.}},

Abstract = {{Mounding of the ground-water table beneath recharge sources may be of
   concern where the raised water table approaches too closely to
   near-surface facilities or features.  Because of its high accuracy and
   wide range of applicability, the method of Hantush is probably the most
   widely used to calculate the time-varying heights of ground-water mounds
   on extensive and near-horizontal saturated zones.  Use of that method
   entails a number of inconveniences, however, including function
   evaluations and two-dimensional interpolations between tabulated values,
   which must be performed iteratively.  A FORTRAN computer program was
   developed to rapidly perform the necessary iterations and to evaluate
   some rather long and complex equations.  These equations avoid the need
   for interpolation or other approximation procedures, and they provide
   accurate calculations for all conditions.  Comparison of results from
   the computer program with results from approximation procedures
   indicates the areas and extents of the unreliability of the
   approximation procedures.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is proposed for collecting and reducing large collections
   of lineament data. The method consists of three steps: (1) collection of
   lineament data using multiple observers, multiple observation trials,
   and several types of imagery; (2) reproducibility tests; and (3) domain
   overlap analysis. Collection of lineament data and reproducibility tests
   are performed by overlaying lineament maps drawn by several observers or
   by superimposing multiple maps prepared by a single observer and
   identifying lineaments which are coincident (coincident lineaments =
   lineaments that have azimuths within +/- 5-degrees and separation
   distances are within 1-2 mm at the scale of drawing). Domain overlap
   analysis is accomplished by measuring the trends of near-vertical
   fractures at outcrops distributed over the study region and comparing
   the spatial distribution of these trends with similar-trending
   coincident lineaments. Lineaments that are not reproducible and are not
   geographically correlative with fractures are considered unimportant and
   removed from the data base. The method was applied to a 44 km2 study
   area in Maine and resulted in a reduction in the lineament data base
   from 6500 to 217. Transmissivities determined for bedrock wells located
   within 30 meters of lineaments that are both reproducible and
   geographically correlative with outcrop-scale fractures are generally
   higher than the transmissivities of wells located near lineaments that
   are not separated on the basis of these criteria. Application of the
   method serves as an important filter by providing a more manageable
   lineament data base from which to begin detailed field checking and/or
   geophysical surveys directed toward specific lineaments.}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The bedrock surface beneath unconsolidated eolian sand and garbage at
   the active Casper, Wyoming landfill was successfully imaged using a
   refraction statics method.  The method employed the summation of
   common-detector refraction seismic traces in a manner analogous to
   common midpoint (CMP) reflection seismic methods.  The method produces a
   seismic time section that is interpreted in much the same way as
   reflection seismeic time sections.  The method was very robust in
   imaging the bedrock surface, even when the refractions were poorly
   defined on both unprocessed and filtered shot records.  Processing of a
   refraction statics data set is less expensive than CMP high-resolution
   reflection processing and does not rely on the detailed graphical
   constructs of the more commonly used refraction seismic analysis
   methods.  This alternative to more commonly used refraction and
   reflection seismic methods should be applicable in noisy and otherwise
   difficult data acquisition areas where the resolution of first breaks
   and/or reflections is difficult.  The summation of data traces enhances
   the signal to noise ratio allowing direct observation of the bedrock
   image on the time section.  A depth section can be calculated from the
   final time section.  In poor data quality settings, the enhancement of
   the refraction signal by summation of multiple, common-detector data
   traces is the significant advantage of the refraction statics method
   over other refraction seismic interpretation methods which are dependent
   on accurately picking refracted arrivals on individual data traces.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a conceptual model, developed by synthesizing the
   results of many researchers, which describes the geochemical evolution
   of domestic waste water in conventional on-site septic systems as the
   result of the interactions of a few major constituents.  As described by
   the model, the evolution of waste water is driven by the microbially
   catalyzed redox reactions involving organic C and N in waste water and
   occurs in as many as three different redox zones.  Anaerobic digestion
   of organic matter and production of CO2, CH4, and NH4+ predominate in
   the first zone, which consists mainly of the septic tank.  In the second
   zone, gaseous diffusion through the unsaturated sediments of the drain
   field supplies O2 for aerobic oxidation of organic C and NH4+ and a
   consequent decrease in waste-water alkalinity.  The NO3- formed by NH4+
   oxidation in this zone is the primary adverse impact of septic systems
   at most sites and is generally an unavoidable consequence of the proper
   functioning of conventional septic systems.  If adequate O2 is not
   available in the drain field, aerobic digestion is incomplete, and the
   accumulation of organic matter may cause septic-system failure.  In the
   third redox zone, NO3- is reduced to N2 by the anaerobic process of
   denitrification.  However, this setting is rarely found below septic
   systems due to a lack of labile organic C in the natural setting. 
   Consideration of the changing redox and pH conditions in each zone aids

Abstract = {{Kuwait is an arid country with no surface water and very limited
   resources of unseable ground water.  These ground-water reserves have
   been heavily exploited since the 1960s, which has led to substantial
   decline in the potentiometric surface of the aquifers.  A regional
   numerical model, calibrated under both steady and unsteady-state
   conditions, has been used to investigate the hydrodynamic impacts of
   different ground-water management options on the potentiometry of the
   aquifers.  The results indicate that there is a real danger of either
   dewatering the aquifers, or deteriorating water quality by upconing and
   sea-water intrusion, if the present trend of increasing withdrawal rates
   continues unchecked.  In fact, the study suggests that even if the
   withdrawals are completely stopped in the near future, the aquifers will
   not be restored to their pre-1960 conditions by the year 2010. 
   Artificial recharge of the aquifers will have, however, beneficial
   effects on the potentiometric surfaces and should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{A refined Monte Carlo (MC) simulation procedure an an Effective Medium
   Approximation (EMA) are presented for solving the stochastic subsurface
   flow problem.  The refined MC simulation procedure uses analytical means
   to estimate the sample size by controlling the error incurred in using
   the sample average in place of its population mean at a chosen
   confidence level for the pressure head.  Also, an unbiased estimator of
   the pressure head that takes advantage of its correlation with the
   saturated conductivity to reduce its variance is proposed.  This reduced
   variance results in a smaller width of uncertainty about the predicted
   pressure head thereby improving the precision.  The EMA permits one to
   solve the stochastic subsurface flow problem in a single run to generate
   the expected pressure head field with the aid of a field-scale effective
   hydraulic conductivity that has a form similar to the Gardner equation. 
   Both the MC and the EMA approaches perform well when applied to example
   problems taken from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Two forced-gradient ground-water transport tests were conducted in the
   Summers of 1989 and 1990 at Borden, Ontario.  The tests were nearly
   identical in several respects and allow an assessment of the
   reproducibility of such efforts.  In both experiments, carbon
   tetrachloride, tetrachloroethene, and a conservative tracer were
   injected as a pulse into the aquifer and monitored as they migrated
   towards an extraction well.  Data were analyzed using moment techniques
   and fitted with a 1-D transport model accounting for physical
   nonequilibrium conditions for the sorbing solutes.  Visual inspection
   and simulations of the results indicate that the tests are reproducible.
   However, results from the moment analyses are less conclusive, perhaps
   due to data truncation.  The differences in the modeling results or the
   parameter estimates derived from them are likely to have resulted from
   differences in the experimental conditions or duration.  Simulations
   conducted using either year's fitted parameters are essentially
   indistinguishable from a practical point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Type-curve analysis of water-table aquifer pumping-test data has often
   resulted in values of specific yield that are unrealistically low when
   compared with values obtained by volume-balance calculations. It has
   been suggested that such values are the result of inadequate
   representation of drainage processes in the unsaturated zone. The
   commonly used analytical solution developed by Neuman for a homogeneous,
   water-table aquifer assumes that the drainage of pores in the zone above
   the water table due to lowering of the water table occurs
   instantaneously. Published pumping-test data from three relatively
   homogeneous, unconsolidated, granular aquifers with significantly
   different hydraulic conductivities are used to show that type-curve
   analysis based on the Neuman model will result in estimates of specific
   yield that agree with volume-balance calculations, provided that
   established procedures are followed. These involve the use of composite
   plots of drawdown observed at more than one location and inclusion of
   effects of partial penetration. Noninstantaneous drainage of pores in
   the unsaturated zone accounts for the finding that both type-curve
   analysis and volume-balance calculations yield values of specific yield
   that are slightly less than those obtained from laboratory
   column-drainage experiments. It may also account for a slight
   underestimation of vertical hydraulic conductivity as obtained by
   type-curve analysis.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{958-967}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory tests were conducted to examine zero-valent iron as an
   enhancing agent in the dehalogenation of 14 chlorinated methanes,
   ethanes, and ethenes.  All compounds were tested by batch procedures in
   which 10 g of 100-mesh electrolytic iron was added to 40 ml hypovials. 
   Aqueous solutions of the respective compounds were added to the
   hypovials, and the decline in concentration was monitored over time. 
   Substantial rates of degradation were observed for all compounds tested
   with the exception of dichloromethane.  The degradation process appeared
   to be pseudo first-order with respect to the organic compound, with the
   rate constant appearing to be directly proportional to the surface area
   to volume ratio and increasing with increasing degree of chlorination. 
   Column tests showed the process to proceed under flow conditions with
   degradation rates independent of velocity and consistent with those
   measured in the batch tests.  When normalized to 1 m2/ml, the t50 values
   ranged from 0.013 to 20 hr, and were about 5 to 15 orders of magnitude
   lower than values reported for natural rates of abiotic degradation. 
   The results indicate abiotic reductive dechlorination, with iron serving
   as the source of electrons; the mechanism is, however, uncertain.  Based
   on the rapid rates of degradation, both in situ and aboveground
   applications for remediation of contaminated ground water are proposed.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Multicomponent transport with cation exchange induces a separation of
   cations during displacement of waters in aquifers.  The spatial
   separation is due to different retardations of the various cations which
   originate from differences in selectivity of the exchange complex.  The
   composition patterns are complex, and calculated mostly with numerical
   models.  However, a basic notion of features such as salinity fronts,
   chromatographic sequence, and front type is useful for general
   understanding of the processes.  These aspects have not obtained the
   level of generality in hydrochemical studies that they deserve, and are
   introduced and applied in the paper.  Demonstrated are:  (1) the
   calculation of a multicomponent exchange complex from solution
   composition with the law of mass action; (2) the front type (broadening,
   indifferent, sharpening) that develops in relation to the slope of the
   sorption isotherm; (3) the calculation of a chromatographic pattern for
   the case of sharp fronts; (4) the effects of salinity changes on
   solution composition.  All these features are illustrated with examples
   and then applied to calculate and compare water compositions in an
   observation well from two field studies, one of a salt-water injection
   which displays the salinity effects very clearly in accordance with
   theory, and one of a fresh-water injection for which the complete
   sequence of three ions Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ can be calculated simply with
   a quadratic equation.}},

Abstract = {{An ICP-MS, equipped with an ultrasonic nebulizer and active-film
   multiplier detector, is used to attempt to determine 54 trace elements
   directly in ground water. Lithium, arsenic, rubidium, strontium, barium,

   ppb) range. Most of the other elements are present at nanogram-per-liter
   (part-per-trillion = ppt) concentrations. Ion exchange preconcentration
   is utilized in order to improve the sensitivity for measuring the rare
   earth elements that exist at concentrations as low as 0.05 ppt for
   lutetium, thulium, and terbium. The formation of molecular species in
   the plasma produces false positive results for some of the elements. The
   presence of silicon or carbon dioxide interferes with the measurement of
   scandium, strontium interferes with rhodium and palladium, and barium
   interferes with europium. Correction procedures for these interferences
   are discussed. All together, the concentrations of the 54 elements in
   water from four Nevada springs span almost seven orders of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the first paper of a two-part series concerned with
   assessing the potential for organic chemical leaching to a ground-water
   skimming tunnel in the Pearl Harbor Basin, Oahu, Hawaii as a direct
   result of a proposed urban development.  The objective of our
   simulation-based assessment was to provide insight into the potential
   for chemicals, that may be introduced to the recharge areas of the
   Waiawa Shaft as a result of the proposed developments, to subsequently
   leach through the unsaturated zone to ground water.  In this paper field
   and laboratory results are presented for experiments designed to support
   the modeling effort reported in the second paper of this series.  The
   chemical leaching experiments were conducted at two field locations. 
   The chemicals which were applied and then monitored for their downward
   movement in the near-surface unsaturated zone are bromide, chlorpyrifos
   and fenamiphos.  We found (1) good mass balance for bromide at both
   sites, (2) limited mobility of chlorpyrifos and fenamiphos at the field
   plots, and (3) good agreement between field and laboratory measured
   degradation rates.}},

Abstract = {{The intensive use of the Coastal Plain aquifer, Israel, as well as its
   ongoing contamination by domestic and industrial waste and agrichemicals
   has resulted in the deterioration of its water quality.  The Coastal
   Plain aquifer is divided into a number of calcareous sandstone units,
   separated by silt and shale lenses.  Whereas the shallow, uppermost
   units are unconfined, the lowermost aquifers are partly confined. 
   Although the presence of hydrological subunits is geologically
   well-documented, the aquifer has been traditionally managed by the
   Israel Water Authority as a single water system.  This study focused on
   the deeper units of the Coastal Plain aquifer where contamination may be
   less significant.  The hydraulic connections between the overlying
   shallow units and the deep units were examined along two regions
   parallel to the main ground-water flow direction, from east-southeast to
   west-northwest.  The working hypothesis was that if hydraulic separation
   by the silt and shale lenses is effective, chemical and isotopic
   variations can be traced, and ground-water-level variations in each unit
   are likely to be different.  The observed difference in hydraulic heads,
   distinct patterns of temporal water-level variations, different C-14 and
   tritium activities, and diverse chemical compositions suggest that the
   silt and shale lenses form an effective hydraulic partition between the
   shallow and deep sand units, both in the western and eastern parts of
   the aquifer.  Our limited observations indicate that although the nature
   of the hydraulic separation and its effects are spatially variable, the
   prevailing conceptualization of the aquifer as one water body lacking
   vertical separation is incorrect.}},

Abstract = {{A contaminant plume more than 7,700 meters long and a few hundred meters
   wide has been delineated using a network of bundle piezometers.  The
   location, concentration, and starting time of the source are
   well-defined.  The plume occurs in a stratified, highly permeable, sand
   and gravel aquifer in which the ground-water flow is unusually steady in
   direction and magnitude.  A ground-water velocity of 380 meters per
   annum and a longitudinal dispersivity of 60 to 120 meters are obtained
   by simulating chloride breakthrough data at 7,700 meters from the
   source.  Simulation of the cross-sectional distribution of chloride
   concentrations at 5,500 meters shows the horizontal transverse
   dispersivity to be at most 0.10 meters.  This very small maximum value
   for horizontal transverse dispersivity is two to four orders of
   magnitude smaller than values reported in the literature for plumes of
   similar lengths.  It is postulated that the very weak lateral dispersion
   is due primarily to the steadiness of the ground-water flow.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is presented to estimate the relationship between
   unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil-water pressure using tension
   infiltrometer data.  In this method, both the early transient and the
   subsequent quasi-steady stages of the infiltration process underneath a
   tension infiltrometer disc are analyzed.  Our investigation indicates
   that the infiltration rate at early times closely follows the
   aquare-root-of-time relationship (Philip, 1969).  This behavior permits
   the evaluation of the sorptivity, which is an integrated measure of soil
   diffusivity.  At later times, three-dimensional quasi-steady flow
   beneath the infiltrometer disc develops, and the Wooding equation for
   from a circular pond is used to evaluate the sorptive number and the
   saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Simple algebraic expressions are
   introduced to relate the sorptivity and sorptive number to the
   parameters of the Brooks and Corey model of unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity.  The method described here extends the utility of tension
   infiltrometer data to a large class of hydraulic conductivity models and
   provides an in situ technique to determine suitable parameters values
   for these models.}},

Abstract = {{As suggested in the computer note printed in this journal in March-April
   1993 and titled `'United Nations Ground-Water Software,'' to which this
   note is a sequel, the Windows version is completed and ready for
   distribution.  The software, known as Ground Water for Windows (GWW), is
   the United Nations contribution to the ground-water data information
   processing and management.  GWW is flexible, user-controlled,
   sophisticated, and versatile.  It is an object oriented, relational data
   base and tailored for use as a ground-water information system (GWIS). 
   The software integrates classical ground-water information (lithology,
   hydrographs, chemistry, pumping tests, etc.) with geographic displays. 
   The software is programmed as a Windows application, and it uses all
   Windows resources:  memory management, fonts, colors, screen, printer,
   and plotter drivers, etc.  It is input and output device independen, and
   has no memory limitations except for the ones that are intrinsic to any
   Windows application.  The data base can be filtered; that is, a large
   set of information can be reduced to subset having user-selected
   attributes on any part of the data.  The user designs the structure of
   the data base and creates entry and reporting forms.  The software is
   primarily intended for the creation of large relational data bases on a
   site, region, province, county, or country wide basis.
   In addition to ground-water data processing, GWW has its own powerful
   mapping utility.  Various location and thematic content maps become and
   integral part of the ground-water base.  The exchange of information
   with other software packages is enabled via import and export of
   AutoCad's DXF and ASCII files.
   Following the philosophy that a picture is worth a thousand words, GWW
   emphasizes graphics on screen and printed in:  maps, logs, cross
   sections, hydrographs, various chemical diagrams, etc.  The current
   version of this software is in the public domain and is available
   through the United Nations for the developing world or through
   educational courses for the developed world.}},

Abstract = {{A computer model, named DNAPMIG (DNAPL Potential Migration), was
   developed to calculate the dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)
   critical length required to initiate movement and direction of potential
   migration at locations within an area of interest.  The model takes into
   consideration the potentiometric gradient, bottom structure elevation,
   DNAPL density, interfacial tension, contact angle, soil grain size,
   partitioning coefficient, effective solubility, and water saturation. 
   The model is interfaced with SURFER graphics software to use vectors to
   indicate the DNAPL critical length and the potential migration
   direction.  The potential for DNAPL existence and migration at a
   specific site can be estimated by relating chemical concentration in the
   ground water to its solubility limit and the DNAPL critical length.  The
   possibility of vertical migration can also be determined.
   This model can be used to determine and compare the effectiveness of
   existing or alternative recovery well systems to capture a DNAPL plume
   or arrest its movement; to help determine optimum locations and pumping
   rates of recovery wells; and to help determine the optimum location of
   environmental borings to locate DNAPL.  This paper presents two
   hypothetical examples and two site applications in south Louisiana.}},

   GASOLINE THICKNESS IN A UNIFORM SAND AQUIFER}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{708-718}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{A common effort involved in the remediation of contamination by
   petroleum hydrocarbons in porous media is the monitoring and volume
   estimation of the immiscible hydrocarbon fluid. The apparent free
   product thickness indicated by a standard monitoring well is typically
   much greater than the actual free product thickness in the surrounding
   soil. This results in significant errors in estimates of drainable fluid
   (product) volume, which in turn leads to inaccuracies (i.e., over
   design, improper pump sizing, etc.) with remediation system design.
   An equation to predict actual thickness was developed using
   heterogeneous fluid flow mechanics and hydrostatics. This equation is:
   t(g) = t(1 - S-g)- h(a), where t(g) = actual formation free product
   thickness, t = apparent(well bore product) thickness, S-g = specific
   gravity of petroleum hydrocarbon (gasoline in this research), and h(a) =
   distance between the ground-water table and the free product in the
   formation.
   The developed theory was compared to data collected from a physical
   model which simulated field conditions. The theory was used to estimate
   product thickness in the model, and then these estimates were
   statistically tested far accuracy. The theoretical slope, (1 - S-g), was
   not statistically different from the regression slope at test levels of
   alpha = 0.05 and alpha = 0.01, while the theoretical intercept (h(a))
   was statistically different at alpha = 0.05 and alpha = 0.01. The
   discrepancy between the theoretical intercept and the regression
   intercept was probably due to either an incorrect assumption that h(a) =
   (h) over bar(c)((h) over bar(c) = average wetting capillary rise), or an
   incorrect laboratory measurement of (h) over bar(c).
   The effects of water-table fluctuations were also studied. A rising
   water table caused a decrease in apparent thickness and an increase in
   actual thickness, and vice versa. No theoretical equation was developed
   for the effects of water-table fluctuations, but it was reasoned that
   hysteresis of the saturation curve and adsorption were the primary
   factors in the observed trends.
   Finally, the developed theoretical equation was compared to the results
   of previously published predictive methods and experiments. The
   comparison was made by calculating percent error and using a chi-square
   statistic. The developed theory was found to be the best predictor of
   actual product thickness for both laboratory data sets used.}},

   pathline counting method using the semianalytical module RESSQC,
   contained within the WHPA model, was compared to MT3D, a numerical mass
   transport code, for a simple hypothetical problem. Results from the
   comparison indicate that results from the pathline counting approach
   were in reasonable agreement with the MT3D results. This approach was
   then applied to a field study, the Park City Bioremediation Project. The
   migration of a conservative tracer injected into three upgradient cells
   was simulated to estimate the concentration of solute at two pumping
   wells. The calculated concentrations compared favorably with measured

Abstract = {{An in situ surfactant washing process was previously developed and

   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and oils (Abdul et al., 1992). A second
   phase of the pilot study, conducted the following year at the same site,
   confirmed the technical viability of this process. The results of the
   phase II study surpassed the predictions of the long-term performance of
   this technology based on the phase I results. Soil cores taken from the
   plot before the phase I and phase II studies and after the phase II
   study showed mass reduction and redistribution of the contaminants.
   A continuous column washing study using the same contaminated soil
   showed consistency with field results. The amounts of PCBs removed in
   the laboratory and field studies, respectively, are 7\% and 10\% after
   5.7 pore volume (PV) washings (phase I) acid 19\% and 24\% after 8 PV
   washings (phase II). More than 85\% of the PCBs were removed from the
   laboratory soil column after 105 PV washings. This study supports the
   phase I study which indicates that the in situ surfactant washing
   process is a viable remediation technology for hydrophobic contaminants.}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{735-742}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{The vertical component of specific discharge was estimated across
   several depth zones in the aquifer system at Canutillo, Texas. The
   specific discharge was estimated using temperature and thermal
   conductivity data from four observation wells bottoming near the base of
   the aquifer system.
   Specific discharge was first calculated (using a steady-state model)
   from the slopes of conductive heat flow versus temperature plots. The
   heat flow plots for all four wells suggested a zone of downward
   ground-water flow from similar to 70 to similar to 220 feet depth and
   one or two zones of upward flow from similar to 800 to similar to 220
   feet depth. Head data from observation wells did support the conclusion
   of an upper zone of downflow as indicated by the temperature data;
   however, the head data suggested that ground water should presently be
   moving downward from similar to 220 to similar to 800 feet.
   A computer model was developed to determine if the temperatures may be
   remanent and therefore reflect prepumping ground-water flow,
   particularly in the deep flow zone. Computer model estimates were made
   of during-pumping downflow in the upper flow zone. For the deep flow
   zone computer model estimates were made of prepumping upflow, The
   computer model estimates and steady-state vertical specific discharge
   estimates were similar for the upper zone having downward flow. In the
   deep zone prepumping upflow estimates modeled on the computer were the
   same order of magnitude as steady-state heat flow specific discharge
   estimates. Hence, present temperature data may demonstrate a significant
   remanent groundwater flow component and therefore might be used to
   estimate past vertical ground-water flow.}},

Abstract = {{Under many circumstances during an RCRA investigation, the EPA will not
   allow intrusive sampling of an SWMU (Solid Waste Management Unit, or
   `'waste dump''). This presented difficulties in characterizing the waste
   within a closed landfill identified as an SWMU located on land owned by
   Purdue University, 3 kilometers northwest of the West Lafayette
   (Indiana) campus because there were few records of what was discarded
   into this public dump during its operation from 1958-87. Chemical and
   isotopic data of shallow ground water and surface runoff provided a
   realistic means to infer movement of contaminants away from the
   landfill.
   Leachate is characterized by high concentrations of Na+ and Cl- (similar
   to 4mN), sulfate (similar to 8 mN), total hardness (Ca+2 + Mg+2 similar
   to 19 mN), and alkalinity (similar to 12mN). Disposal of road salt is
   responsible for the NaCl concentrations, while dissolution of concrete
   explains the high Ca+2, Mg+2 and alkalinity values for waters having a
   pCO(2) only slightly above the regional level for ground waters
   (10(-1.82)atm).
   Deep and shallow uncontaminated ground waters in the vicinity of the
   SWMU have an average delta(34)S value of 0.5 per mil 34 (CDT). Since the
   delta(34)S of leachate lies between + 10 and + 17 per mil (CDT), the
   high sulfate concentrations are most likely due to dissolution of
   interred plasterboard consisting primarily of gypsum.
   Tritium activities for the leachate in two shallow well emplaced 15
   meters from the toe of the SWMU ranged from 55 to 85 TU. Correcting for
   half-lives and correlating these activities to historical records of
   tritium in rainfall as measured at Chicago, these H-3 activities suggest
   that the travel time between the SWMU interior and these wells is

Abstract = {{Spatial variability of hydrologic properties was quantified for a
   nonwelded-to-welded ash flow tuff at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, the
   potential site of a high-level, nuclear waste repository. Bulk density,
   porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and sorptivity were measured
   on core specimens collected from outcrops on a grid that extended
   vertically through the entire unit thickness and horizontally 1.3 km in
   the direction of ash transport from the volcanic vent, A strong,
   geologically determined (deterministic) vertical trend in properties was
   apparent that correlated with visual trends in degree of welding
   observed in the outcrop. The trend was accurately described by simple
   regression models based on stratigraphic elevation (vertical distance
   from the base of the unit divided by unit thickness). No significant
   horizontal trends in properties were detected along the length of the
   transect. The validity of the developed model was tested by comparing
   model predictions with measured porosity values from additional outcrop
   sections and boreholes that extended 3000 m north, 1500 m northeast, and
   6000 m south of the study area. The model accurately described vertical
   porosity variations except for locations very close to the source
   caldera, where the model underpredicted porosity in the upper half of
   the section. The presence of deterministic geologic trends, such as
   those demonstrated for an ash flow unit in this study, can simplify the
   collection of site characterization data and the development of
   site-scale models.}},

Abstract = {{Slug and packer tests provide data for determining the local value of
   hydraulic conductivity in aquifers. However, most techniques commonly
   used for test interpretation disregard any anisotropy of the tested
   formation. Using dimensional analysis, an extension of available methods
   for interpretation of slug and packer tests to anisotropic conditions is
   developed. The technique is a transformation of the radial dimension via
   the well radius, and involves dividing the true well radius by the
   square root of the anisotropy ratio which must be specified a priori,
   This technique can be applied to formulae, computer programs, graphs, or
   tabulated data available for confined or unconfined isotropic
   conditions. It also reduces the number of computer computations. As an
   example, the technique is used to extend the Bouwer and Rice (1976)
   method, which was developed for isotropic conditions, to anisotropic
   conditions. A comparison of the Bouwer and Rice (1976) method corrected
   for anisotropy, with the Widdowson et al. (1990) method, yields
   horizontal hydraulic conductivities differing by 8\% (in one typical
   case). Ignoring anisotropy for the same case results in a 44\%
   underestimation of horizontal conductivity.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The contamination by salt-water intrusion affecting the coastal aquifer
   at Castell de Ferro (Granada, Spain) is especially influenced by the
   coexistence of two coastline lithological formations with highly
   differing transmissivity (highly karstified limestones and detrital
   sediments). Despite not having a very high intrusion volume (0.1-0.2
   hm(3)/year), the aquifer does have a high saline content. In order to
   explain this phenomenon, we first of all modeled the ground-water flow
   (MODFLOW) in the aquifer. Two models were then used for the
   fresh-water/salt-water contact: one assuming a sharp interface (BADON2)
   and the other taking into account density-dependent mass transport
   (MOCDENSE). Our conclusion is that the high saline content of the
   aquifer is due to the existence of a preferential route for ground-water
   now through the karstified materials in contact with the detrital
   materials and the sea. The detrital materials located beside the
   karstified massif therefore constitute the route for only 10\%-20\% of
   the system's total outlet to the sea, which is not enough water to wash
   the salts resulting from salt-water intrusion. We also find that in this
   type of aquifer two-dimensional transport models do not provide the most
   realistic results, since the effect in a direction transverse to the
   ground-water flow of very transmissive material cannot be simulated in
   this type of profile. In this case, and despite its limitations, better
   results are obtained using the sharp interface model.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{The exaggeration of light nonaqueous phase liquids (LNAPL), typically
   hydrocarbon, by monitoring wells is a well-known problem that introduces
   significant errors in the estimation of recoverable hydrocarbon. Farr et
   al. (1990) and Lenhard and Parker (1990) show that significantly
   different volumes of hydrocarbon may produce the same thickness of
   hydrocarbon in a monitoring well, due to differences in the capillary
   characteristics between soil types. The purpose of our investigation was
   to evaluate the influence of local sediment variability on estimation of
   hydrocarbon volumes. Sediment samples from two sites underlain by a
   relatively homogeneous sandy deposit were collected within a small area.
   Capillary characteristic curves were determined for 10 samples from one
   site and 41 samples from the second site using a pressure plate.
   Grain-size analysis was performed on all samples for which pressure
   plate data were available.
   The results show significant variability, even for small sites. For
   example, a hydrocarbon volume of three cm(3)/cm(2) could produce
   anywhere between 45 and 200 cm of hydrocarbon within an observation
   well. This suggests that use of an `'average'' soil sample to
   characterize hydrocarbon exaggeration, within even a very small site,
   can lead to substantial errors. It also suggests that maps of apparent
   hydrocarbon thickness can be extremely misleading, leading hydrologists
   to place remediation wells in areas of greatly exaggerated thicknesses
   produced by fine-grained materials.
   Comparison between characteristic curves calculated from grain-size
   analysis using the approach of Mishra et al. (1989) to those measured
   using the pressure plate shows poor correlation that introduces large
   errors into the estimated hydrocarbon volumes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper, the second in a two-part series, examines the applicability
   of the sharp-interface approach to modeling initial accumulation and
   spreading of a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) in the ground-water
   aquifer. The sharp-interface approach models NAPL transport by
   developing a time-distance profile from Darcy's law by assuming a piston
   or plug flow. The approach is tested here against an immiscible-phase
   model that includes capillarity effects in the formulation. Although
   significant assumptions are included in the sharp-interface model, it
   may be useful for initial screening, in obtaining an order-of-magnitude
   estimate of travel times, and in describing the approximate extent of
   the free and dissolved NAPL contamination. In the absence of data for
   calibration, the paper introduces guidelines for estimating the
   parameters of the model. By integrating the formulation in Part 1 and
   this part, a practical approach for analysis of NAPL contamination is
   defined; the underlying assumptions and simplifications have to be
   recognized, however.}},

Abstract = {{Many analytical methods use radial and rectangular systems to interpret
   unsteady-state reservoir flow problems. However, there is no information
   currently available for irregularly shaped aquifers. For many practical
   cases the aquifer drainage shape is too complicated to be approximated
   by a circular or rectangular shape. This paper develops an image-well
   method for predicting drawdown transient in an aquifer with irregularly
   shaped boundaries. Previously, the use of the image-well method to
   predict drawdown transient was only possible for aquifer boundaries of
   regular shape.
   In this paper, the well function is obtained by superposing the Theis
   solution of image wells in time. The image-well method is first applied
   to regularly shaped aquifers. The validity of the approach is then
   proved by comparison of the calculated well functions with literature
   values for various regular drainage shapes. The proven method was
   applied to interpret a field pumping test and to characterize the
   reservoir boundaries with irregular shape.}},

Title = {{DIFFUSIVE DISAPPEARANCE OF IMMISCIBLE-PHASE ORGANIC LIQUIDS IN FRACTURED

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{In a new conceptual model for immiscible-phase organic liquids in
   fractured porous media that specifically includes the effect of
   molecular diffusion on the persistence of organic liquid in fractures,
   dissolved contaminant mass from the liquid in fractures is test by
   diffusion from the fractures into the porous matrix between the
   fractures. Theoretical calculations for one-dimensional diffusive fluxes
   from single, parallel-plate fractures using parameter values typical of
   fractured porous geologic media establishes the concept of
   immiscible-phase disappearance time, which is the time required for a
   given volume of immiscible liquid in a specified aperture to disappear
   following its arrival in the fracture. Nonlithified surficial clayey
   deposits with matrix porosities ranging from 25 to 70\% are extensive
   across many regions of North America and Europe, and at shallow depth,
   typically have fractures with apertures in the range of 1 to 100
   microns. The common chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane (DCM),
   trichloroethene (TCE), and tetrachloroethene (PCE) are expected to
   completely disappear in these deposits within a few days to weeks. For
   fractured sedimentary rocks with much lower matrix porosities (5-15\%),
   disappearance times for these solvents are generally less than several
   years for fracture apertures ranging from 10 to 200 microns typical for
   shales, siltstones, sandstones, and carbonate rocks. This is sufficient
   time for the immiscible phase of chlorinated solvent contamination to
   have disappeared at many industrial sites. This conceptual model has
   important implications with respect to ground-water monitoring,
   diagnosis of the nature and degree of contamination, and expectations
   for ground-water remediation at many contaminated sites. Proposed
   methods for enhancing immiscible-phase mass removal using hydraulic
   manipulation, surfactants, or alcohols will be futile where the
   immiscible phase has disappeared into the clay or rock matrix, and
   reverse diffusion and desorption wilt control clean-up time frames.
   Therefore, prospects for permanent restoration of many DNAPL and LNAPL
   sites in fractured porous media are more limited than previously
   thought.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses two particular problems which arise in particle
   tracking calculations because of the spatial discretization used in the
   block-centered finite-difference flow model. These two problems are: (1)
   the presence of a `'weak'' sink or source (i.e., a sink or source that
   does not result in complete inward or outward gradients on all
   interfaces of the cell containing the sink or source); and (2) the use
   of a model grid with varying vertical cell dimensions within an
   individual layer. While these problems can be mitigated by using a
   sufficiently fine spatial discretization, there are always computational
   and practical limitations on the number of model nodes. Two procedures
   are presented in this paper which minimize particle tracking errors
   associated with weak sinks/sources or vertically distorted grids. The
   first procedure uses an approximate analytical solution to define the
   velocity distribution inside a model cell containing a weak sink/source
   so that the capture of the particles entering the cell can be determined
   accurately. The second procedure establishes an automatic adjustment of
   the particle vertical coordinate according to the degree of vertical
   grid distortion. These procedures are shown to be effective, and improve
   the accuracy of particle tracking results under nonideal spatial
   discretizations.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation of ground-water now and transport is often impeded
   by a lack of information regarding the conceptual model and properties
   that best represent the water-bearing formation. Inverse analysis
   assists in the estimation of the properties of the formation once a
   defensible form of the conceptual model is defined. In essence, inverse
   analysis reverses the direction of model application to determine the
   properties that best match data collected from the formation under
   investigation. This paper describes the development of an inverse
   analysis implementation of the well-known and versatile SUTRA model of
   ground-water flow and transport. The inverse analysis algorithm retains
   the extensive functionality of SUTRA in forward simulation and allows
   various forms of parameter constraints to be stipulated. Addition of
   inverse analysis functionality to an existing ground-water model
   circumvents the development of redundant models, reduces development
   time, and ensures the consistent and concurrent development of
   predictive and interpretive capabilities. Two example analyses are
   presented to demonstrate a portion of the functionality of the novel
   inverse analysis algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of several conservative, noninteracting tracers is
   desirable for the study of water movement in porous media. Recent
   studies have identified a family of fluorinated benzoic acid derivatives
   as having transport properties similar to Br-. The transport properties
   of 2,6-difluorobenzoate (2,6-DFBA), 2,5-difluorobenzoate (2,5-DFBA),
   3,4-difluorobenzoate (3,4-DFBA), 3,5-difluorobenzoate (3,5-DFBA),
   o-(trifluoromethyl)benzoate (o-TFMBA), m-(trifluoromethyl)benzoate
   (m-TFMBA), and pentafluorobenzoate (PFBA) were compared to Br in two
   neutral pH, high organic soils from Iowa. Batch equilibrium studies and
   column transport studies showed that 2,6-DFBA, PFBA, and o-TFMBA have
   transport properties very similar to Br-, although their behavior may
   deviate slightly as the organic carbon and clay fractions of the soil
   increase. 2,5-DFBA is retarded less and dispersed slightly more than the
   above tracers in these soils, but may be a useful tracer since it is
   still conservative. The other fluorobenzoates showed greater degrees of
   interaction with the soil matrix and were not conservative precluding
   their use as acceptable tracers. Plant growth studies using corn (Zea
   mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max {[}L] Merr.) showed significantly (P =
   0.05) decreased growth for treatments using 3,4-DFBA and 3,5-DFBA,
   precluding their use in agronomic settings. Given the variation shown
   here and in earlier studies, the transport behavior of any of the
   fluorobenzoates should be evaluated prior to use in new environments.}},

Title = {{A SURVEY OF CHARGE-BALANCE ERRORS ON PUBLISHED ANALYSES OF POTABLE
   GROUND AND SURFACE WATERS}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},

Abstract = {{Although the charge balance for a single chemical analysis of a water's
   electrolytes is not a reliable gauge for the accuracy of that analysis,
   the percent charge-balance error (\%CBE) becomes more credible as a
   means for evaluating analytical technique when applied to groups of
   analyses.
   Just how good are charge balances for chemical analyses of potable
   ground and stream waters in mainline geological journals? Starting with
   each journal's first volume, a search found 68 articles in six journals
   (Appl. Geochem., Chem. Geol., Geochim. Cos. A cta., Ground Water, J.
   Hydrol., and Water Resources Res.) that had what was deemed to be
   `'complete'' analyses of individual samples' major ions. Analyses of
   brines and hydrothermal solutions were excluded as were `'composite''
   averages. A total of 1,062 \%CBEs were computed and tabulated, and the
   average was 3.99\% +/- 6.56 (1sigma).
   The average \%CBE (by journals) ranges from 1.55\% to 9.34\%. Quality of
   \%CBE is slightly better for articles published after 1970. Not
   surprisingly, low ionic strength samples are prone to charge-balance
   errors > 10\%. Of the 1,062 charge balances calculated, 612 were
   positive and 450 were negative. Eight of the 68 articles had analyses
   that were evenly balanced between positive and negative CB errors. There
   are 21 articles in which the majority of analyses had negative
   charge-balance errors. Thus a clear majority (39) of articles had
   analyses in which there were more positive than negative charge-balance
   errors.
   Systematic error is likely for situations where the analyses in an
   article are predominantly positive or predominantly negative. The likely
   reason for the former occurrence is lab determination of alkalinity from
   the nonacidified field aliquot. Failure to filter samples may cause the
   latter situation-especially in carbonate terranes. Systematic laboratory
   errors involving salt standards and dilutions can also yield
   charge-balance errors for a suite of analyses that are skewed to either
   positive or negative errors. The care with which the analyst did his/her
   job may also impact charge-balance errors.}},

Abstract = {{Using superpositioned analytic functions (elements), it is possible to
   directly solve the following well discharge optimization problems in
   general flow models: 1. Determine the discharge of well A which will
   produce a certain head or drawdown at location B. 2. Determine the
   discharge of well A which will produce a specified component of aquifer
   discharge at location B. These problems often arise while designing
   contamination remediation systems, designing dewatering systems, or
   making ground-water resource allocation decisions. Such problems are
   solved by trial and error with nonoptimized models, or solved
   iteratively with standard optimizing methods. With this analytic
   formulation, they can be solved directly. This approach can be used to
   optimize the performance of a single well or to simultaneously optimize
   the performance of numerous wells. For example, it is possible to solve
   directly for the combination of discharges at wells A, B, C, D, and E
   that will produce specified heads at locations F and G while producing
   specified aquifer discharges at locations H, I, and J. Applications of
   the method are demonstrated using TWODAN, a program for analytic
   two-dimensional flow modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional physical modeling of diesel fuel leaks was conducted in
   sand tanks to determine liquid and vapor migration characteristics.
   Mathematical modeling provided estimation of vapor concentrations at
   discrete times and distances from the vapor source and was compared to
   the physical experiment. The mathematical gaseous diffusion model was
   analogous to the Theis equation for ground-water flow, accounted for
   sorptive effects of the media, and was calibrated using measured
   concentrations from the sand tank. Mathematically different positions of
   the vapor source were tested to better relate observed liquid flow rates
   and media configuration to gaseous concentrations. The calculated
   diffusion parameters were then used to estimate theoretical,
   three-dimensional vapor transport from a hypothetical liquid leak of 2.0
   1/hr for 30 days. The associated three-dimensional vapor plume, which
   would be reasonably detectable by commercially available vadose zone
   monitors, was estimated to have a diameter of 8 m with a vapor
   concentration of 50 ppm at the outside edge of the vapor plume. A
   careful application of the method and values can be used to give a first
   approximation to the number of vapor monitors required at a field site
   as well as the optimal locations for the monitors.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant enhanced subsurface remediation is being evaluated as an
   innovative technology to expedite contaminant extraction from the
   subsurface. Regulatory approval of this technology will likely be
   enhanced by use of surfactants with FDA direct food additive status
   (''edible'' surfactants). This research establishes edible surfactant
   systems capable of solubilizing (via micellar partitioning) and
   microemulsifying (via middle phase microemulsions) chlorinated solvents
   (PCE, TCE, and trans 1,2-DCE). Micellar partition coefficients with
   edible surfactants are observed to be comparable to values previously
   reported for other surfactants, with solubilization increasing aqueous
   concentrations by one to two orders of magnitude for the chlorinated
   organics. Middle phase microemulsion formation is dependent on
   surfactant structure and cosurfactant concentration. Solubility
   enhancement in the middle phase systems (microemulsification) is at
   least one to two orders of magnitude higher than solubilization for the
   same surfactant concentration, but is much more sensitive to the
   surfactant system and the contaminant. In addition, successful
   microemulsion formation is seen to be a function of ground-water
   temperature and hardness, indicating the need to consider these and
   additional factors for successful design and implementation of
   surfactant enhanced subsurface remediation. This research thus
   establishes a variety of edible surfactant systems that can
   significantly expedite subsurface remediation of chlorinated solvents,
   and illustrates the importance of proper selection and design of
   surfactant systems.}},

Abstract = {{Various methods for numerical determination of aquifer transmissivity
   and storage coefficients from a single observation well data have
   recently been proposed. Most of these methods involve reading the slope
   values from a table or providing an initial estimate for iterative
   solution. A different formulation of the slope-matching technique has
   been suggested in the field of petroleum engineering which obtains the
   parameter values without using any tables or iterative procedures. In
   this study we adopt a similar approach and compare the prediction of
   various techniques. The modification of the approach to include cases
   with time-varying parameters is examined. Numerical experiments are
   performed first on synthetic data to ascertain the relative accuracy of
   different slope evaluation techniques. It is shown that the slope of the
   drawdown with respect to the logarithm of time results in the most
   accurate prediction of aquifer parameters. The inaccuracy involved in
   application of the slope-matching methods to cases involving
   time-varying parameters is analyzed. The methods are then applied to
   some field data and the results are compared with published data. All
   the methods are found to work reasonably well for the field application.}},

Abstract = {{A straight impervious boundary within an ideal confined aquifer may be
   detected in the semilog drawdown graph of an observation well. This
   paper gives and assesses two known and one proposed equations that may
   help to determine the location and orientation of an impervious
   boundary. Then the two conditions for an adequate detection are
   established. First, if the distance of the pumping well to the boundary
   is called `'a,'' only those observation wells at a distance smaller than
   a/5 from the pumping well can detect the boundary. Second, data must be
   collected for approximately two time log cycles after the slope has
   changed in the drawdown graph. Similar equations, and time or distance
   conditions, are given for the case of two intersecting straight
   impervious boundaries. Frequently, the two conditions are not met. In
   this case, the drawdown graphs give incorrect estimates of aquifer
   parameters. In most field conditions, a combination of drawdown data,
   geophysical surveys, and exploratory boreholes is mandatory to locate
   one or two impervious boundaries. Available methods and a proposed one
   for recharge boundaries are assessed in a companion paper.}},

Abstract = {{A straight recharge boundary in an ideal aquifer is easily detected in
   the drawdown graph of an observation well. Two known and one proposed
   methods can be used to find the location and orientation of the recharge
   boundary. This paper assesses their performance. Both the law of times
   and the method of inflection point overestimate the distance r(i) to the
   imaginary well when the ratio beta = r(i)/r(r) is smaller than 20. In
   this case, known methods also give incorrect estimates of aquifer
   parameters. The proposed method gives directly the beta-value when it is
   higher than 20. For lower beta-values, a correction factor transforms
   the apparent beta-value into the correct beta-value. Two examples
   illustrate the quality of predictions by the known and proposed methods.
   Two known and one proposed methods relative to impervious boundaries are
   assessed in a companion paper.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model of the ground-water flow and recharge to the Mahomet
   Bedrock Valley Aquifer (MVA), east-central Illinois, was developed using
   major ion chemistry and isotope geochemistry. The MVA is a `'basal''
   fill in the east-west trending buried bedrock valley composed of clean,
   permeable sand and gravel to thicknesses of up to 61 m. It is covered by
   a thick sequence of glacial till containing thinner bodies of
   interbedded sand and gravel. Ground water from the MVA was found to be
   characterized by clearly defined geochemical regions with three distinct
   ground-water types. A fourth ground-water type was found at the
   confluence of the MVA and the Mackinaw Bedrock Valley Aquifer (MAK) to
   the west.
   Ground water in the Onarga Valley, a northeastern tributary of the MVA,
   is of two types, a mixed cation-SO42- type and a mixed cation-HCO3-
   type. The ground water is enriched in Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42- which
   appears to be the result of an upward hydraulic gradient and interaction
   of deeper ground water with oxidized pyritic coals and shale. We suggest
   that recharge to the Onarga Valley and overlying aquifers is 100\% from
   bedrock (leakage) and lateral flow from the MVA to the south.
   The central MVA (south of the Onarga Valley) is composed of relatively
   dilute ground water of a mixed cation-HCO3- type, with low total
   dissolved solids, and very low concentrations of Cl- and SO42-    .
   Stratigraphic relationships of overlying aquifers and ground-water
   chemistry of these and the MVA suggest recharge to this region of the
   MVA (predominantly in Champaign County) is relatively rapid and
   primarily from the surface.
   Midway along the westerly flow path of the MVA (western MVA), ground
   water is a mixed cation-HCO3 type with relatively high Cl-, where Cl
   increases abruptly by one to greater-than-or-equal-to two orders of
   magnitude. Data suggest that the increase in Cl- is the result of
   leakage of saline ground water from bedrock into the MVA. Mass-balance
   calculations indicate that approximately 9.5\% of recharge in this area
   is from bedrock. Concentrations of Na+, HCO3 , As, and TDS also increase
   in the western MVA.
   Ground water in the MAK is of a Ca2+-HCO3 type. Mass-balance
   calculations, using Cl- as a natural, conservative tracer, indicate that
   approximately 17\% of the ground water flowing from the confluence area
   is derived from the MVA.}},

Abstract = {{Nonpoint source ground-water contamination, resulting from regional
   scale applications of agrichemicals, is a major environmental issue.
   Several federal and state government funded modeling efforts were
   undertaken in the 1980s to assess ground-water vulnerability from past
   and current chemical use and to potentially aid in the regulation of new
   chemicals. This paper is concerned with the impact of data uncertainties
   in regional scale pesticide leaching assessments for the chemical diuron
   in the Pearl Harbor Basin on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. in the first
   part of the paper uncertainties in soil, recharge, and chemical data are
   artificially reduced to study the impact of reduced data uncertainties
   on ground-water vulnerability assessments made with simple mobility
   indices; the greatest improvements were realized for improvements in the
   chemical data. In the second part of the paper the impact of
   improvements to the Hawaii soil data, in the form of new soil organic
   carbon information, is characterized relative to changes in ground-water
   vulnerability assessments made with a simple index. The additional soil
   organic carbon data does not yield improvements to the original
   vulnerability assessment that would be considered justifiable. The best
   use of regional scale chemical leaching assessments based upon modeling
   approaches as simple as index methods is for guiding data collection
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-water modeling is hindered, in general, by the lack of adequate
   information about the ground-water system and hence the need for an
   interactive and efficient system for data preparation and results
   analysis. Such a lack of information usually necessitates the use of a
   tedious iterative methodology within a sensitivity analysis scheme. This
   study facilitates modeling efforts by using the data-handling and
   graphical capabilities of a geographic information system in
   site-specific, numerical modeling of ground-water resources. Data for
   the island of Oahu, Hawaii, are given to illustrate the approach. The
   modeling procedure is integrated within the GIS as an item in the main
   menu. A USGS model, known as MOC, is linked into the system and applied
   to a case study to illustrate the procedure. The linkage is generic in
   nature and can be extended to other models as well. The availability of
   a programming language in the GIS package facilitates pre- and
   post-processing efforts within custom-made dialogue boxes and pull-down
   menus. On-line help screens for modeling as well as data handling can
   also be designed.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and mobility of light, nonaqueous phase hydrocarbons in
   the subsurface is poorly understood, particularly in relation to
   observations of hydrocarbons in monitoring wells. Recent work by Lenhard
   and Parker (1990) and Farr et al. (1990) resulted in an equilibrium
   model in which the degree of hydrocarbon saturation was shown to be a
   function of the apparent thickness of hydrocarbon in a monitoring well,
   the height above the oil/water interface, and the capillary
   pressure/saturation characteristics of the soil. The current
   investigation compared measured hydrocarbon saturations, hydrocarbon
   volumes, and hydrocarbon mobility to those predicted by the capillary
   characteristic model of Farr et al. (1990) and Lenhard and Parker
   (1990). Five monitoring wells were completed in boreholes drilled in a
   hydrocarbon-contaminated area of downtown San Diego, where apparent
   hydrocarbon thickness varied from zero to over 1.5 meters. Up to 2.5
   meters of continuous core was obtained from each of the boreholes and
   split into 3 cm intervals. Alternating 3 cm samples were analyzed for
   total petroleum hydrocarbon, and the remaining samples were used for
   grain-size analysis and measurement of capillary characteristic curves.
   Slug-withdrawal tests were conducted on the hydrocarbon intervals, and
   constant-rate discharge tests were conducted on the water-saturated
   intervals of the monitoring wells.
   The results show typical hydrocarbon saturations of 5\% to 20\%, with
   one borehole showing a limited zone of up to 50\% saturation.
   Hydrocarbon mobility (relative permeability) is greatly reduced due to
   the low saturations, as predicted by capillary theory. These
   observations are consistent with both the capillary model of hydrocarbon
   distribution and with the very low recoveries achieved using hydrocarbon
   skimming systems.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport problems with sharp transitions or high advection are
   difficult to solve with traditional finite-difference (FD) and
   finite-element (FE) techniques. When advection dominates, the solutions
   obtained by these traditional methods typically suffer numerical
   smearing or oscillations. In these cases, acceptable numerical solutions
   of the classical advection-dispersion equation by FE and FD techniques
   can be obtained only by using a fine discretization on space and time
   that allows the stability requirements expressed by the Courant and
   Peclet numbers to be satisfied. This leads to large computer times. A
   way for overcoming this problem is to use a moving-grid method. The
   dynamically self-adaptive moving finite-element (MFE) grid method, used
   in this work, obtains accurate and efficient solutions of the
   advection-dispersion equation in a very wide range of Courant and Peclet
   numbers. The MFE method accurately simulates, with no oscillations, very
   steep fronts using space and time step sizes well beyond conventional
   constraints of the Peclet and Courant numbers. To demonstrate the
   accuracy and efficiency of the MFE method, some test cases are presented
   where the MFE, FD, and analytical solutions are compared.}},

Abstract = {{A geochemical field study was conducted on the municipal aquifer in
   Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada to determine the cause of increased
   manganese levels, from 0.02 mg/l to about 1.0 mg/l over a 34-year
   period, in three of five production wells. The source of water for each
   of the five production wells has been determined to be infiltrated river
   water or precipitation, or a mixture of these sources. Wells that are
   predominately withdrawing infiltrated river water have corresponding
   high manganese concentrations, and redox potential data indicate that
   manganese tends to be in the aqueous form Mn2+. Geochemical modeling
   further suggests that the ground water is undersaturated with several
   common manganese minerals, while remaining supersaturated with iron
   oxide-hydroxide minerals. The primary cause of the temporal increase in
   manganese concentrations is attributed to increased dissolved organic
   carbon introduced to the aquifer as a result of the escalating
   contribution of river water to the aquifer with time. Oxidation of
   organic matter proceeds in a ground-water environment, as dissolved
   oxygen is depleted, by utilizing manganese oxides as electron acceptors.}},

Abstract = {{Anomalously warm water in shallow wells and surface springs is found in
   and around the town of Wells, Nevada. The geology of the Wells area is
   dominated by Paleozoic and Miocene sedimentary rocks which are cut by
   high angle normal faults. Thermal springs are associated with the normal
   faults, whereas thermal water from wells is the result of upward
   vertical fluid infiltration through the porous, Miocene lacustrine
   sedimentary rocks and Quaternary alluvium. Temperature logs from a
   nearby oil exploration well show locally high geothermal gradients (>
   50-degrees-C/km). Analysis of static water heads indicates that vertical
   flow is greater than or equal to horizontal flow in low-lying areas near
   the town of Wells. Solution of the advection-diffusion equation using
   temperature data from the upper portion of the oil well suggests upward
   flow velocities of approximately 2-10 m/yr. Cold waters have a mixed
   cation-bicarbonate chemistry whereas thermal waters are dominantly (Na +
   K)-bicarbonate. Chemical geothermometers indicate fluid circulation to
   depths between 1-2 km. Deuterium and oxygen-18 analyses have
   considerable variability, with modest deviations from the global
   meteoric water line. The occurrence of deuterium as light as - 145 part
   per thousand suggests significant recharge to the hydrothermal system
   from very high elevations or water which has had a long subsurface
   residence time and is recording the signal of a cooler climate.}},

Abstract = {{In the buried-valley aquifers of the western and central glaciated
   plains of North America, assemblages of permeable outwash facies may
   form large and productive regional aquifer systems. In glacially derived
   aquifers it is common to have low-permeability facies (e.g., till or
   lacustrine clay)juxtaposed with high-permeability facies (e.g., sand and
   gravel outwash). The heterogeneity in the Miami buried-valley aquifer
   system in southwestern Ohio was examined as an example. Practical
   approaches for evaluating the lithological uncertainty were explored in
   the areas lacking data. The facies types were represented by an
   indicator random function, which exhibited an isotropic, exponential
   covariance structure. A comparative, quantitative analysis of the facies
   boundaries was accomplished using three different indicator
   geostatistical methodologies: (1) hydrostratigraphic analysis with
   indicator point kriging and probability cutoff, (2) hydrostratigraphic
   analysis with conditional indicator simulation, and (3) leakance
   zonation with indicator block kriging and grid-cell averaging. With the
   first method, it was shown in a theoretical analysis that the 0.5
   probability level computed by indicator point kriging may or may not
   coffespond to the boundary between high- and low-permeability facies,
   depending upon the level of data support. With the data support for the
   Miami aquifer system, the 0.65 probability contour gave an areal
   distribution of low-permeability facies that honored both the original
   data and the declustered global mean of the original indicator data. The
   first and third methods gave rise to a single model, in which the facies
   distribution was best in some local accuracy sense. The second method
   gave rise to many alternative models, in which the global texture of the
   facies distribution took precedence over local estimation of the
   expected value. The first two methods involved evaluating the geometry
   of the boundaries between the facies types in advance of creating the
   grid of the numerical ground-water model, so that grid cell boundaries
   could be made to correspond to facies boundaries. The third method was
   useful when updating an existing ground-water model that has grid cell
   boundaries not necessarily corresponding to facies boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{In the agglomeration of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), South Viet Nam, located
   near the eastern edge of the Mekong Delta, both superficial Quaternary
   and deep Tertiary Alluvium may contain brackish or saline water from
   ground surface to great depths. The combination of two complementary
   geophysical methods, the Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) for shallow
   investigation, and the Magnetotelluric Sounding (MTS) for deep
   investigation, gives a more complete electrical image of the sedimentary
   series from the surface to the deep crystalline basement. It turned out
   to be very efficient in delineating the ground-water contamination in
   both superficial and deep aquifers. The combined results reveal a close
   correlation of the extent of the contamination with the
   paleo-geomorphology of laterites, and subsequently with the paleorelief
   during the Tertiary and Quaternary periods. A simple guide for
   hydrogeological investigation is proposed in connection with the present
   topography and the Tertiary tectonics.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Soil solution samples are often collected and analyzed without
   consideration for either the drainage period or changes in solution or
   solute flux. A sampling method to assess the vertical flux of solution
   and solute in the unsaturated zone was evaluated. Potassium bromide
   (KBr) solution and distilled water were applied to the surface of a
   soil. Estimated and measured solution and solute discharge through the
   soil column were compared. The column consisted of Plainfield sand
   (mixed, mesic, Typic Udipsamments) packed in a 208-liter cylinder.
   Following solution application, discrete samples were collected at one-
   to two-hour intervals with a ceramic soil solution sampler centrally
   located in the column. In each test, the Br concentrations of discrete
   samples were measured, and the Br concentration of a time-integrated
   composite sample was calculated. Solution flux was estimated by
   monitoring vertical soil-water tension and content gradients with
   tensiometers and time domain reflectometry probes, respectively, and
   applying the unsaturated form of Darcy's equation. In three of four
   tests, differences between measured and estimated solution discharge
   were less-than-or-equal-to 20\%. Differences in measured and estimated
   Br mass discharge ranged from 1 to 37\%. Correlation coefficients
   between estimated and measured Br mass discharge based on discrete and
   composite sample concentrations were 0.905 (p = 0.095) and 0.70 (p =
   0.30), respectively.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{363-366}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{A more general solution to the step-drawdown test, called the General
   Well Function, GWF, is proposed to replace the classic Jacob's
   step-drawdown equation for situations when the time that wells are
   continuously pumped varies greatly. Jacob's equation requires a
   preselected discharge duration and does not incorporate time as an
   independent variable. Jacob's equation has been criticized for that
   shortcoming since drawdown is obviously dependent on time as well as
   discharge. The General Well Function, GWF, not only corrects for this
   weakness but appears to better predict drawdowns that extend beyond the
   test data than, for example, the FASTEP code based on Jacob's equation.
   The GWF assumes that both formation and well losses increase over time.}},

Abstract = {{A permeable wall injection system is capable of introducing dissolved
   substances into an aquifer in a manner which minimizes the displacement
   of naturally present ground water, and maximizes the potential for
   dispersive mixing. The system operates predominantly in a passive mode,
   and should require relatively little power and small amounts of
   chemicals. The injection wall is a permeable cutoff wall installed
   across the path of a contaminant plume. The ground water can be amended
   with the desired nutrient solution using pumping and injecting wells
   within the wall. The high permeability of the wall ensures that the
   injection-withdrawal operation causes flow which is primarily confined
   to the wall itself. Thus, only a minimal disruption of the ambient flow
   need result from a nutrient injection. After the nutrients have been
   introduced to the wall, the pulse is permitted to drift into the aquifer
   under natural gradient conditions, spreading longitudinally as it goes.
   Theoretical calculations and preliminary results of a field trial
   indicate that if this pulsing cycle is repeated at intervals of weeks to
   months (site-specific), a stable microbial population can be supported
   at some distance downgradient from the wall.
   The advantages of this system include the predominantly passive nature
   of its operation, the effective use of longitudinal dispersion to
   maximize the mixing of added substances with contaminated ground water,
   and the flexibility of the system with regard to the types of
   biodegradation reactions which it can promote.}},

Abstract = {{Macropores play an important role in many soils in relation to
   ground-water contamination by providing preferential pathways from the
   root zone to the water table. Surface-applied agrochemicals may hereby
   be carried quickly to the shallow ground water. The reduced retention
   combined with a small contact area between the flowing water and the
   soil implies that little removal from physical, chemical, and
   microbiological processes may take place, thus increasing the risk of
   groundwater contamination.
   A laboratory procedure for evaluating the effect of macropores in a
   given soil is proposed and tested. The procedure involves the following
   sequence of experiments on two undisturbed soil monoliths: (1)
   measurements of the distribution of outflow, (2) measurements of
   breakthrough curves, (3) dye application for visual observation of
   macropores; and (4) horizontal slicing of the monoliths to measure
   macropore distribution and continuity of macropores. The experimental
   procedure is based on well-documented techniques that combined will
   provide evidence on the significance of macropores in relation to
   ground-water contamination and guidance for selecting the appropriate
   model for simulating flow and transport at the field in question.
   The laboratory procedure was tested on two large, undisturbed soil
   monoliths (30 cm in diameter) removed from the unsaturated zone at a
   clayey moraine agricultural field in Denmark. This soil was known to
   have many macropores. The investigations documented the strong influence
   of these structures on flow and transport suggesting that a traditional
   flow and transport model would be inadequate for simulating the
   processes occurring in the field.}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state two- and three-dimensional ground-water-flow models coupled
   with particle tracking (fluid-particle pathline analysis) have been
   evaluated to determine their relative effectiveness in delineating
   contributing areas and particle traveltimes to public-supply wells in
   two contrasting stratified-drift aquifers of Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
   Several contributing areas delineated by the three-dimensional pathline
   analysis do not conform to simple ellipsoidal shapes that are typically
   delineated by use of two-dimensional analytical and numerical modeling
   techniques. They also include discontinuous areas of the water table and
   do not surround the supply wells. Because two-dimensional areal models
   do not account for vertical flow, they cannot adequately represent many
   of the hydrogeologic and well-design variables that complicate the
   delineation of contributing areas in three-dimensional flow systems on
   Cape Cod, including the presence and continuity of discrete zones of low
   hydraulic conductivity, large anisotropic ratios of horizontal to
   vertical hydraulic conductivity, partially penetrating supply wells,
   shallow streams and lakes, and low (less than about 0.1 million gallons
   per day) pumping rates.
   Particle traveltimes calculated by the two-dimensional models are longer
   than those calculated by the three-dimensional models, and time-related
   capture zones determined by the two-dimensional models underpredict the
   size of the land area contributing water to simulated wells. It appears
   that the two-dimensional models do not accurately represent shallow,
   partially penetrating wells, or heterogeneous and anisotropic sediments
   for the purposes of simulating contributing areas and traveltimes in
   complex ground-water systems.}},

Abstract = {{The magnitude of water-table drawdown achievable by a fully penetrating
   pumping well in an unconfined aquifer commonly is limited to a small
   fraction of the initial aquifer thickness. The maximum potential
   water-table drawdown can be estimated based on the aquifer thickness,
   the pumping well effective radius, and the estimated radius of influence
   in the aquifer during maximum steady-state pumping (Kozeny, 1953). The
   maximum steady-state flow rate into a well can be predicted if the
   aquifer hydraulic conductivity is known based on observed water-table
   drawdown during a pumping period.
   To achieve the maximum potential pumping rate from a fully penetrating
   well in an unconfined aquifer, the water level inside the well must be
   maintained at the bottom (Kozeny, 1953; this paper). This condition
   creates a seepage face along the inside of the well screen. The
   hydraulics of the seepage face control the removal of water from the
   aquifer and the size of the resulting cone of depression. The area of
   the seepage face, which is a direct function of the effective radius of
   the pumping well, strongly influences the maximum potential water-table
   drawdown and the maximum steady-state pumping rate.
   The vertical component of the hydraulic gradient in the formation is
   downward and increases toward the pumping well. The hydraulic potential,
   therefore, decreases with increasing depth below the water table. Only
   shallow observation wells that are screened across the uppermost
   fraction of the saturated zone are adequate for delineating the actual
   water-table position during pumping. Observation wells screened across
   deeper portions of the aquifer, including fully penetrating, fully
   screened observation wells, exhibit potentiometric drawdown in excess of
   true water-table drawdown.}},

Abstract = {{Linear sorption coefficients and first-order biotransformation rates for
   para-dichlorobenzene (pDCB) and naphthalene are fit to data from a
   three-well forced-gradient (injection-production) field test performed
   at the site of an abandoned creosoting facility in Conroe, Texas. The
   breakthrough curve of an injected inert tracer, chloride, is used to
   describe the hydraulics of the field test. Along each streamline, the
   movement of a reactive solute is described by a one-dimensional
   transport equation. The hydraulic and streamline transport models are
   coupled through a combination integral, the evaluation of which yields
   the effluent concentration (at the production well) of that reactive
   solute as a function of time. Transport parameters for the field site,
   sorption coefficients and biotransformation rates for pDCB and
   naphthalene, are obtained through inverse analysis of effluent data
   obtained at one of the production wells. The method is formulated such
   that no formal treatment of dispersion is required.}},

Abstract = {{The experimental identification of transversal dispersivity in the
   laboratory is not a very developed subject; the authors herein propose
   two methods for identifying transversal dispersivity in laboratory
   experiments, based on the analytical solution of a continuous,
   point-like, injection of a nonreactive solute in a flow tank packed with
   a homogeneous porous medium. The solute transport is supposedly
   two-dimensional, whereas the hydraulic flow is monodimensional with a
   uniform velocity.
   Each identification method is based on the measurement of concentration
   in pairs of points. In the first method the points are taken along lines
   normal to the direction of the fluid flow, with one of the two points
   set on the central axis of the flow tank. In the second method the two
   measurement points are placed on lines passing through the solute
   injection point.
   The stability of the two methods, with respect to concentration
   measurement errors, is analyzed to assess the reliability of the
   transversal dispersivity estimate. Furthermore, the two methods are
   found to be sensitive to variations of the concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A multiple indicator conditional simulation technique is used to

   Two conceptual geologic models are considered and evaluated for spatial

   of occurrence for three `'families'' of simulations with distinct styles
   of connectivity. Critical ground-water flow paths of each simulated
   section are evaluated as the paths with the highest percent of high
   hydraulic conductivity hydrofacies. The effective hydraulic conductivity
   of these critical paths is evaluated analytically by computing harmonic
   averages. Estimated groundwater travel times are consistent with the
   observed rate of plume migration in the field. This procedure can be
   used to evaluate the probability of occurrence of alternative paths for
   contaminant transport as input to risk assessments, and design of

Abstract = {{Ground-water monitoring to delineate contaminant plumes in complex
   hydrogeologic settings often is uncertain. This uncertainty is
   manifested by the fact that ground-water contaminants often migrate
   along preferred pathways formed by lateral and vertical heterogeneity
   within definable stratigraphic units. A somewhat obscure surface,
   electrical geophysical method first suggested in 1920 holds great
   promise as a tool to help delineate conductive contaminant plumes in
   suitable hydrogeologic environments. This tool known as the
   mise-a'-la-masse method has been used with success by other
   investigators to map conductive orebodies.
   A modified mise-a'-la-masse method was used with great success in this
   investigation during a controlled field experiment. The method was used
   to track the evolution of a conductive tracer plume migrating through
   fluvial sands and gravels under a forced hydraulic gradient. Voltage
   differences between 171 stationary, surface electrodes and a reference
   electrode were monitored over time to map an evolving tracer plume. For
   this particular experiment, the method proved to be sensitive to changes
   in the specific electrical conductance of the ground water of less than
   10\% above the baseline values. Data derived by the modified
   mise-a'-la-masse method show close agreement to specific electrical
   conductance measurements of ground-water samples collected from wells
   during the tracer experiment. However, uncertainty in the significance
   of the variable specific electrical conductance data, especially at
   early times during the experiment, is reduced greatly by comparison with
   the plume maps generated by the modified mise-a'-la-masse method.}},

Abstract = {{A Galerkin finite-element model is developed to solve axisymmetric flow
   problems in confined aquifers subjected to pumping by a single well. The
   model can be used to analyze axisymmetric problems involving pumping
   from multiaquifer systems by wells which are partially screened, fully
   screened, or have multiple screens. A simplified boundary condition at
   the well bore produces results that match analytical solutions. The
   location of the zero-drawdown boundary is determined by using the
   concept of effective radius of influence. This concept is also.used to
   generate a mesh that automatically expands radially in time. The
   expanding mesh feature may lead to savings in computational time since
   it uses relatively few elements and nodes for simulations at small times
   and progressively adds elements and nodes to the mesh for simulations at
   higher times.}},

Abstract = {{The funnel-and-gate system for in situ treatment of contaminant plumes
   consists of low hydraulic conductivity cutoff walls with gaps that
   contain in situ reactors, such as reactive porous media, that remove
   contaminants by abiotic or biological processes. Funnel-and-gate systems
   can be installed at the front of plumes to prevent further plume growth,
   or immediately downgradient of contaminant source zones to prevent
   contaminants from moving into plumes. Cutoff walls (the funnel) modify
   flow patterns so that ground water flows primarily through high
   conductivity gaps (the gates). This approach is largely passive in that
   after installation, in situ reactors are intended to function with
   little or no maintenance for long periods. This approach contrasts with
   the energy and maintenance-intensive character of pump-and-treat
   systems. This paper describes the funnel-and-gate concept, and uses
   two-dimensional computer simulations to illustrate the effects of cutoff
   wall and gate configuration on capture zone size and shape and on the
   residence time for reaction of contaminants in gates.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{477-486}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Ground water of the Trinity Sand aquifer at the Odessa I site has become
   contaminated with hexavalent chromium due to release of plating wastes
   during the 1970s. Measured hexavalent chromium partition coefficients
   for Trinity Sand aquifer sediments compare favorably with values derived
   from the literature, and with retardation factors calculated from
   observed plume migration rates between 1986 and 1991. Dissolved and
   adsorbed masses of hexavalent chromium were calculated from contoured
   plume maps using ground-water data collected between 1986 and 1991 to
   estimate the total mass of hexavalent chromium in the aquifer.
   Comparison of the calculations from each year indicated that only 30
   percent of the hexavalent chromium present in the aquifer in 1986
   remained in 1991.
   Decreasing hexavalent chromium mass in the Trinity Sand aquifer at the
   Odessa I site indicates that natural geochemical reactions are occurring
   to reduce mobile hexavalent chromium to the insoluble trivalent form.
   Thermodynamic calculations based on platinum electrode redox and pH
   measurements indicate that solid trivalent chromium hydroxide species
   are the stable phase in these ground waters. Reduction of hexavalent
   chromium to the trivalent state results in precipitation from solution
   of a solid chromium (III) hydroxide, probably in association with iron
   oxyhydroxides present in the aquifer. Two possible reducing agents in
   the Trinity Sand aquifer are naturally occurring organic carbon and
   ferrous iron.
   Laboratory measurements of the rate of hexavalent chromium reduction
   indicate that the reaction proceeds slowly at near-neutral pH values
   representative of the Odessa I site. Assuming first-order reaction
   kinetics, these laboratory reduction rates are consistent with the rate
   of hexavalent chromium loss at the Odessa I site between 1986 and 1991,
   and indicate a hexavalent chromium half-life of approximately 2.5 years.
   An analytical contaminant transport model was calibrated to simulate
   historical chromium concentrations for the aquifer, and then used to
   predict that hexavalent chromium will naturally decrease below the
   drinking water standard within approximately 10 years.}},

Abstract = {{The EXPRES expert system (EXpert system for Pesticide Regulatory
   Evaluations and Simulations) has been developed to assist those who are
   knowledgeable, but not proficient, in the theory of pesticide transport
   in the subsurface or in the use of pesticide assessment models with a
   means of assessing the potential for pesticides to contaminate ground
   water. EXPRES is not intended to replace expert opinion but rather
   EXPRES is intended to be used as a screening tool by nonexperts who need
   to evaluate the potential for pesticides to contaminate ground water.
   EXPRES combines a knowledge-based system, a graphically based
   user-system interface, extensive geographical and pesticide data bases,
   and three existing pesticide assessment models (LP/LI, PRZM, and
   LEACHM). Based on the user's available data, objectives of the
   assessment and time constraints, EXPRES selects the most appropriate
   model, assists the user in the construction of an input data set,
   initiates an assessment, and aids in the interpretation of the results
   of an assessment model. Specific assistance in the construction of the
   input data set includes providing pertinent data for characterizing a
   site or a pesticide from its data bases, assisting the user to respond
   to a prompt from EXPRES, aiding the user in estimating missing values
   for pesticide or site parameters, and ensuring the integrity of the
   input data set. The inclusion of three models allows EXPRES to select
   the model which is most applicable for the objectives on the
   investigation, including: (1) a review of pesticide properties and site
   characteristics that influence the fate of pesticides in the subsurface,
   (2) a relative assessment, with respect to other pesticides, of the
   potential for a pesticide to leach to the water table, (3) a
   quantitative prediction of the distribution and migration rates of the
   pesticide with both time and depth, and (4) an evaluation of the
   processes and factors controlling the fate of the pesticides in the
   subsurface.}},

   be exactly the same as that in the input file, and the number of nearest
   points for searching should be set to 1. If these procedures are not
   followed, contour lines are often not smooth. Consequently, the plots
   can introduce bias that appears as though there is numerical dispersion.
   For cases where calculated data have a nonuniform grid size, we
   recommend using Quadrant as the search method and setting the number of

Abstract = {{The computer program, RORA, allows automated analysis of streamflow
   hydrographs to estimate ground-water recharge. Output from the program,
   which is based on the recession-curve-displacement method (often
   referred to as the Rorabaugh method, for whom the program is named), was
   compared to estimates of recharge obtained from a manual analysis of 156
   years of streamflow record from 15 streamflow-gaging stations in the
   eastern United States. Statistical tests showed that there was no
   significant difference between paired estimates of annual recharge by
   the two methods. Tests of the slopes of best-fit lines through paired
   estimates showed that the slopes were not significantly different from
   unity. Tests of results produced by the four workers who performed the
   manual method showed that results can differ significantly between
   workers. Twenty-two percent of the variation between manual and
   automated estimates could be attributed to having different workers
   perform the manual method. The program RORA will produce estimates of
   recharge equivalent to estimates produced manually, greatly increase the
   speed of analysis, and reduce the subjectivity inherent in manual
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional environmental investigations at tidally influenced hazardous
   waste sites such as marine fuel storage terminals have generally failed
   to characterize ground-water flow and chemical transport because they
   have been based on only a cursory knowledge of plume geometry, chemicals
   encountered, and hydrogeologic setting and synoptic ground-water-level
   measurements. Single-time observations cannot be used to accurately
   determine flow direction and gradient in tidally fluctuating aquifers
   since these measurements delineate hydraulic head at only one point in
   time during a tidal cycle, not the net effect of the fluctuations. In
   this study, a more rigorous approach was used to characterize flow and
   chemical transport in a tidally influenced aquifer at a marine fuel
   storage terminal using: (1) ground-water-level monitoring over three
   tidal cycles (72 hours), (2) geostatistical filtering of
   ground-water-level data using 25-hour and 71-hour filtering methods, and
   (3) hydrocarbon fingerprinting analysis.
   The results from the study indicate that naphtha released from one of
   the on-site naphtha tanks has been the predominant contributor to the
   hydrocarbon plume both on-site and downgradient off-site and that net
   ground-water and hydrocarbon movement has been to the southeast away
   from the tank since 1989. These conclusions are supported by: (1) the
   elongate configuration of the hydrocarbon plume parallel to the mean
   ground-water flow directions determined using the 25-hour and 71-hour
   filtering methods; and (2) the occurrence of free-naphtha-product and
   elevated levels of BTXE and TPH in the naphtha range (C7 to C14)
   downgradient, but not upgradient, of the naphtha tank. The results also
   indicate that ground water containing 2.1 to 3.6 ppm TPH in the motor
   oil range (C22 to C32) is migrating onto the site from an upgradient
   source area to the north and/or northwest. Therefore, the background
   concentration or cleanup level of TPH for the facility is 2.1 ppm or
   greater. This study provides a more quantitative approach than
   traditional approaches for characterizing flow, assessing chemical
   transport and upgradient impacts, determining site-specific ground-water
   cleanup levels, and optimally locating ground-water monitor wells and
   extraction wells or trenches at tidally influenced hazardous waste
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{The most extensive data base for fractured bedrock aquifers consists of
   drilling reports maintained by various state agencies. We investigated
   the accuracy and reliability of such reports by comparing a
   representative set of reports for nine wells drilled by conventional air
   percussion methods in granite with a suite of geophysical logs for the
   same wells designed to identify the depths of fractures intersecting the
   well bore which may have produced water during aquifer tests. Production
   estimates reported by the driller ranged from less than 1 to almost 10
   gallons per minute. The moderate drawdowns maintained during subsequent
   production tests were associated with approximately the same flows as
   those measured when boreholes were dewatered during air percussion
   drilling. We believe the estimates of production during drilling and
   drawdown tests were similar because partial fracture zone dewatering
   during drilling prevented larger inflows otherwise expected from the
   steeper drawdowns during drilling. The fractures and fracture zones
   indicated on the drilling report and the amounts of water produced by
   these fractures during drilling generally agree with those identified
   from the geophysical log analysis. Most water production occurred from
   two fractured and weathered zones which are separated by an interval of
   unweathered granite. The fractures identified in the drilling reports
   show various depth discrepancies in comparison to the geophysical logs,
   which are subject to much better depth control. However, the depths of
   the fractures associated with water production on the drilling report
   are comparable to the depths of the fractures shown to be the source of
   water inflow in the geophysical log analysis. Other differences in the
   relative contribution of flow from fracture zones may by attributed to
   the differences between the hydraulic conditions during drilling, which
   represent large, prolonged drawdowns, and pumping tests, which consisted
   of smaller drawdowns maintained over shorter periods. We conclude that
   drilling reports riled by experienced well drillers contain useful
   information about the depth, thickness, degree of weathering, and
   production capacity of fracture zones supplying typical domestic water
   wells. The accuracy of this information could be improved if relatively
   simple and inexpensive geophysical well logs such as gamma, caliper, and
   normal resistivity logs were routinely run in conjunction with bedrock
   drilling projects.}},

Abstract = {{Multiport ground-water sampling systems in five deep core holes near
   DOE's Y-12 facility at Oak Ridge, Tennessee provide data on the
   three-dimensional distribution of ground-water types and chemical
   evolution processes. Interpretation of ground-water chemistry, coupled
   with data on the primary and authigenic mineralogy from drill core,
   indicates the ground water evolves chemically by three main processes:
   (1) open system dissolution of calcite and dolomite at shallow depths to
   produce Ca-Mg-HCO3 waters; (2) irreversible dissolution of gypsum, which
   causes dedolomitization and leads to the formation of Ca-Mg-SO4 Waters
   at deeper levels; and (3) mixing with deep brines to form saline
   Na-Ca-Cl waters. Evidence for dedolomitization included the
   precipitation of authigenic calcite in gypsum dissolution cavities,
   decrease in ground-water pH, and increases in dissolved Ca, Mg, and SO4.
   In this study, we document the dedolomitization process along a
   relatively short (< 2000 ft) flow path in low permeability Paleozoic
   carbonates. Mixing of the shallower ground water with an Na-Ca-Cl brine
   thought to be present at depth can account for the progressive increase
   in salinity of ground water with depth and the precipitation of
   authigenic barite and celestite. The mixing process could be a
   combination of diffusion from below, diffusion from older matrix water
   into fractures, or advective mixing.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface unsaturated soils and ground water directly beneath a
   manufacturing site have been shown to contain benzene. The vadose zone
   appears to be the current source for benzene to the aquifer. Although
   the ground water contains several mg/l of contamination in the area
   immediately beneath the source, benzene was not detected in monitoring
   wells approximately 400 feet downgradient. Based upon the length of time
   benzene has been present in the ground water, as well as the
   permeability of the aquifer, physical processes alone such as adsorption
   and advection/dispersion are unlikely to account for the observed
   attenuation. Results from this investigation indicated the attenuation
   was primarily due to the natural biological processes occurring within
   the aquifer.
   Evidence for the natural bioremediation of benzene from the ground water
   included: (1) analysis of ground-water chemistry, (2) laboratory studies
   demonstrating benzene biodegradation in aquifer samples, and (3)
   computer simulations examining contaminant transport. Laboratory studies
   indicated that under conditions similar to those encountered in the
   ground water, benzene was degraded to carbon dioxide by the naturally
   occurring microorganisms. The aerobic degradation of benzene in aquifer
   samples was quite rapid, with the time for 50\% disappearance of the
   parent compound ranging from 4 to 14 days. In situ analyses of the
   ground water indicated significant levels of dissolved oxygen throughout
   the aquifer. Thus, the availability of oxygen should not limit the
   aerobic biodegradation of benzene. However, benzene was also shown to
   degrade under anaerobic conditions in microcosms prepared with aquifer
   material. Computer model simulations were also conducted to examine the
   processes influencing the transport of benzene in the aquifer. Results
   from the model simulations indicated biodegradation was the dominant
   process influencing attenuation of the contaminant.}},

Abstract = {{In the dolomite aquifer of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, stratigraphic
   units deposited as mudstones have little or no visible macroporosity
   and, based on injection-pressure tests, have average horizontal
   hydraulic conductivities of approximately 10(-6) cm/sec, controlled by
   jointing. Coarse-grained units (packstones and grainstones), however,
   have horizontal hydraulic conductivities of 10(-4) cm/sec and greater,
   argued to be controlled by granularity, not jointing. Using this
   relationship between texture and hydraulic conductivity in Milwaukee
   County and a sedimentary facies analysis, trends in hydraulic
   conductivity values are predicted for five stratigraphic units over an
   area of approximately 3500 km2. The predictions are tested qualitatively
   with sets of specific capacity values within the various stratigraphic
   units, and quantitatively with injection-pressure test values from five
   additional locations. Seven of eight qualitative and four of six
   quantitative predictions are judged to be successful. Therefore, trends
   in hydraulic conductivity, and to some extent local values, in this
   carbonate aquifer are predictable over areas of thousands of square
   kilometers without any site-specific data on jointing.
   The success rate could not have been this high if hydraulic conductivity
   were not controlled by the granularity of the lithologic units. It is
   argued, therefore, that the local bulk hydraulic conductivity of this
   carbonate aquifer is controlled by the granular porosity, and the
   aquifer will generally behave as a porous medium, even at the small
   scale of a typical pumping test.}},

Abstract = {{Soil parameters controlling vapor flow in the subsurface are necessary
   to design soil vapor extraction (SVE) cleanup systems. Previous work
   assumes a confined flow model, with concrete and asphalt surface covers
   providing the confining layer and preventing air leakage into the zone
   of vapor transmission. SVE field tests conducted as part of this
   investigation, however, exhibited responses that are inconsistent with a
   confined flow model; it appears that the real world leaks. This paper
   develops a transient soil vapor extraction (SVE) testing method that
   considers the effects of vertical leakage. Analytic methodologies are
   developed that allow use of commonly available ground-water flow type
   curves to evaluate SVE test data. The key implications of leaky compared
   to confined flow are (1) smaller values of derived vapor permeability,
   and (2) decreased radial cleanup efficacy, both with time and distance.}},

Abstract = {{This communication describes novel methods to measure site-specific
   sorption data, and to determine if biodegradation of pentachlorophenol
   (PCP) in complex technical-grade formulations occurs at industrial
   facilities. Ground-water slurry samples containing between 0.012 and 230
   mg/l PCP were collected from a former wood treating site, the liquid and
   solid fractions separated, and both fractions analyzed for PCP using
   selective ion monitoring to determine sorption coefficients (K(d(PCP))).
   Although field sorption coefficients could not be represented by simple
   Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms, an empirical hyperbolic function
   (K(d(PCP)) 0.054 + 0.086/C(aq)) fit the isotherm (r > 0.99),
   demonstrating that for PCP > 10 mg/l, no measurable retardation occurred
   in the aquifer. Biodegradation of PCP in ground water was apparent when
   PCP concentrations were < 20 mg/l, while at higher concentrations, PCP
   in the technical-grade formulation appeared to break down less readily.
   The results imply that, at the plume periphery, PCP in the subsurface
   will be attenuated and degrade, while at higher concentrations (i.e., at
   the source), PCP is mobile, and more recalcitrant to degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of air-permeability in outcrops provide a means of
   obtaining numerous spatially distributed measurements for statistical
   analysis and subsequent parameterization of ground-water flow and
   transport modeling. The air-minipermeameters previously used for such
   studies generally consist of a compressed air source, rotameters, and
   diaphragm gauges. We present a lightweight syringe-based
   air-minipermeameter (LSAMP) design that is significantly more portable
   than previous instruments. The prototype model is contained in a 12.7 X
   15.2 X 23 centimeter (5 X 6 X 9 inch) electrical box and weighs
   approximately 2 kilograms. The prototype LSAMP has a sampling range of
   0.5 to 200 darcys. Individual measurements in this range require less
   than one minute. Permeability measured with the LSAMP closely correspond
   to permeability measured with a traditional minipermeameter and those
   measured on cores. Measurement error caused by soil moisture is less
   than 5 percent for volumetric water contents less than 5 percent. An
   analysis of variance on 38 triplicate measurements indicates that the
   variability associated with measurement error is much less than the
   range of measured values. Repeated permeability measurements under field
   conditions on two standard cores indicate that while the measurement
   error is greater under field conditions, the prototype device field
   performance is consistent with laboratory calibration results.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of recession hydrographs, from four karst springs in Europe,
   provides important information concerning the flow process operating in
   karst aquifer systems. Three analytic equations are used to evaluate the
   hydrographs: Mangin's equation, that assumes the recession is composed
   of both quickflow and baseflow; Coutagne's equation which considers the
   recession to be the response of a single reservoir; and a new function,
   H(t) (which is derived from Coutagne's equation), that refers to the
   whole recession curve. Using Mangin's equation it is apparent that the
   saturated zone and thus baseflow exerts nearly complete control over the
   discharge of La Villa spring and is fairly important at Fuente Mayor and
   Baget springs, but is much less significant at Aliou spring. The
   saturated zone accounts for 100\%, 90\%, 91\%, and 40\% respectively for
   these springs. Using Coutagne's equation and H(t) it is concluded that
   for Aliou and Baget springs, water flows freely in the high transmissive
   zones, but in the poorly transmissive zones, there is little continuity
   of connection in the system. At Fuente Mayor spring the differences in
   these zones are not so apparent and a gradual transition occurs.
   However, at La Villa spring, the karst aquifer is evidently much more
   homogeneous and the discharge is similar to that of a porous
   intergranular aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the DRASTIC classification methodology, with special emphasis
   on Swedish conditions, indicated both favorable and unfavorable
   properties of the system. The study showed that the fairly large number
   of parameters (seven) and the correlations between these parameters give
   DRASTIC some advantageous statistical properties. A comparison of the
   DRASTIC parameters with parameters found to determine the effects on
   ground-water quality in surficial aquifers in southwestern Sweden from
   acid deposition showed a good agreement between these two parameter
   sets; the study thus indicated that the selection of parameters is
   relevant for general ground-water vulnerability assessments in Sweden.
   The concept of hydrogeologic settings and the possibility to trace
   results backwards in the system is excellent, but the qualitative weight
   functions in DRASTIC result in a simplistic index of unclear meaning
   that is less useful and less distinctive than desired. The system tends
   to overestimate the vulnerability of porous media aquifers compared to
   aquifers in fractured media; the rating tables need to be revised so
   that more weight is given to specific surface and effective porosity,
   and less to hydraulic conductivity. The applicability of the results
   would be enhanced and the risk of misuse reduced if the results were
   more clearly directed toward scientifically defined factors, e.g.
   sorption capacity, travel time, and dilution.}},

Title = {{A REWETTING APPROXIMATION FOR A SIMULATOR OF FLOW IN A SURFICIAL AQUIFER
   OVERLAIN BY SEASONALLY INUNDATED WETLANDS}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{An approximation is presented to rectify situations occurring as part of
   the three-dimensional simulation of surficial aquifer flows in which
   surface grid cells become dry (zero saturated thickness) and then cannot
   readily receive flows that would again partially saturate them. The
   approximation permits the cells to be rewetted by adjusting dry cell
   pressures by the same amount as the pressure change computed for the
   uppermost nondry cells in the vertical column. This is continued in
   successive timesteps until the dry cells once again become partially or
   fully saturated.
   The rewetting procedure was tested in a recent transient simulation of
   flows in the surficial Biscayne aquifer of Dade County, Florida, which
   is partly covered by seasonally inundated wetlands. The uppermost layer
   of the model (layer 1) was used to represent overland sheetflow and grid
   cells of high equivalent hydraulic conductivity in this layer became dry
   and were rewetted seasonally, requiring a relatively robust
   representation of rewetting. The rewetting procedure made possible a
   simulation of overland sheetflow stages and aquifer water-table
   altitudes between 1945 and 1989 that was generally correct to within
   about 1 foot in inundated and noninundated regions.
   In a 6-year time period (1962-67) in which the behavior of the rewetting
   procedure was studied in detail, there were 4,723 simulated cell
   rewettings, of which 3,172 were in the overland sheetflow layer and
   1,551 were in the uppermost aquifer layer (layer 2). The average head
   adjustment in a cell rewetting was 0.10 foot in layer 1 and 0.15 foot in
   layer 2. This study demonstrates an empirical approach to the problem of
   cell rewetting that might prove useful in other models of flow in
   surficial aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with establishing the breakthrough time for
   leachate to migrate out of waste facilities containing large quantities
   of low-level, radioactive uranium. The impoundments have clay liners
   which adsorb uranyl cations dissolved in the leachate. A nonlinear
   isotherm, derived from a consideration of the phenomenological basis and
   chemical kinetics of the adsorption process, is used in conjunction with
   a time-dependent, one-dimensional species transport equation to develop
   a mathematical expression for the retarded migration time interval. The
   nonlinear transport equation is identical to one occurring in
   theoretical gas dynamics for the description of shock waves, and whose
   solution is well-known. Results indicate that large breakthrough
   time-interval errors can arise if a linear isotherm is used to model the
   adsorption process, particularly if leachate concentrations along the
   floor of the pit are near saturation. Conversely, at dilute
   concentrations, computations based on the linear isotherm underpredict
   the time interval required for the onset of leakage. The underprediction
   is acceptable from an engineering viewpoint because environmental
   protection afforded by the liner is not overstated.}},

Abstract = {{Factors affecting the dissolution of a toluene pool floating at the
   water table were investigated using an experimental aquifer 85 cm long,
   30 cm high, and 20 cm wide. Under conditions of steady, uniform flow,
   the dissolved toluene concentration decreased with increasing vertical
   distance from the free phase pool, resulting in steep concentration
   gradients. The concentration gradient steepened with increasing
   ground-water velocity. The thickness of the dissolved plume increased
   with increasing distance along the pool and decreasing ground-water
   velocity. In all cases, measured concentrations were a small fraction of
   toluene solubility.
   In pulsed pumping experiments, dissolved toluene concentrations in all
   sampling ports increased significantly during zero flow conditions and,
   when the flow was resumed, they gradually decreased to the same levels
   as before the flow was stopped. Under the experimental conditions used,
   comparison between the pulsed and continuous pumping showed that the
   total mass removal would be higher for continuous pumping and would
   result in shorter toluene removal times. However, the total volume of
   water pumped and needed to be treated would be lower by 50\% for pulsed
   pumping. The latter would result in a higher by approximately 20\% mass
   removed per volume of water pumped, suggesting that pulsed pumping would
   be a more efficient operation compared to continuous pumping, when
   considering removal of dissolved toluene from the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Recent interest in ground-water contamination problems has led to a
   renewed interest in the development of accurate procedures for the
   analysis of in situ permeability tests. The present study involves the
   derivation of analytical procedures for slug tests and constant head
   tests performed in wells with casings open at the bottom and installed
   flush with the upper confining boundary of a finite-depth, anisotropic,
   homogeneous aquifer; the analysis takes into account the effects of a
   finite-thickness skin located at the casing bottom. The Laplace
   transform is used on the governing ground-water flow equations to derive
   the transform of time-dependent water levels measured in the casing. The
   expression is numerically inverted back into the real time domain to
   obtain (1) a set of dimensionless type curves for analyzing slug test
   data, and (2) a relation between the inflow rate, the head maintained in
   the well, the hydraulic conductivity, and a shape factor expression for
   the analysis of constant head data. Existing methods of analysis are
   reviewed and compared with the presently derived analytical procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations were carried out to investigate the capillary
   barrier effect and the wicking ability of multilayer earth liner
   systems. Two specific cases were studied: a two-layer liner composed of
   a fine- over a coarse-textured material, and a three-layer liner
   composed of a medium-textured material in between a fine- and a
   coarse-textured material. Results of the simulations show that a
   quadratic relationship exists between the thickness of the fine-textured
   material and the arrival time of the wetting front to the interface. At
   the time the wetting front reaches the interface, the width of the
   lateral spreading within the fine material is smaller than the thickness
   of this material. The lateral spreading and thickness are linearly
   related. The wicking ability of the different materials is more
   significant under relatively smaller infiltration rates and is
   controlled by the magnitude of the hydraulic diffusivity. For the
   two-layer liner the criteria of minimizing the vertical movement and
   maximizing the wicking effect within the fine-textured material
   conflict. A three-layer liner satisfies both of these criteria. The
   results for the three-layer system show that the medium-textured
   material has more superior wicking properties than the fine material
   does.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has confirmed that low flow rate purging (i.e.,
   approximately 11/min) is a valid technique for 2'' (5 cm) diameter
   monitoring wells with short screened intervals. The use of low flow,
   dedicated pumping devices for purging and sampling minimizes both the
   disturbance of stagnant water in the well casing and the potential for
   mobilization of particulate or colloidal matter which could lead to
   sampling artifacts. In addition, these techniques allow the use of
   purging indicator parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen and specific
   conductance) to determine when to collect a sample for volatile organic
   compound (VOC) determinations. Detailed results from a monitoring
   network in a sand and gravel aquifer contaminated by organochlorine
   solvents support these findings. Recent publications on monitoring well
   hydraulic behavior and considerations of mass averaging effects due to
   pumping also support the use of low flow rate, minimal drawdown purging
   procedures to achieve reproducible sampling results. The suggested
   procedure includes documenting purging indicator parameters while
   purging with dedicated devices at low flow rates with minimal drawdown.
   This sampling method is less time-consuming and reduces the need to
   handle large volumes of purge water since VOC concentrations, O2, and
   specific conductance values stabilized consistently in less than one
   bore volume.}},

Abstract = {{The life and career of Henry Darcy are intimately connected with the
   city of Dijon. He was born there; he died there; and it was there that
   he carried out the experiments that have brought him lasting fame. Darcy
   was not an obscure scientist; he was a well-known and respected public
   figure. His efforts as an engineer and advocate put Dijon on the main
   line of the Paris-Lyon railway, and brought a modern water-distribution
   system to Dijon some 25 years before such a system was put in place in
   Paris. During his life he received great honors, suffered political
   persecution, and carried out his most productive research in his later
   years despite ill health. He died at the relatively young age of 55. The
   main square in the city of Dijon is named Place Darcy in his honor.}},

Abstract = {{Because ft considers basic hydrogeologic variables believed to influence
   contaminant transport from surface sources to ground water, the DRASTIC
   method can be a valuable tool for identifying ground-water supplies that
   are vulnerable to contamination. Theoretically, areas with high DRASTIC
   scores should have more frequent occurrences of ground-water
   contamination events than areas with low scores given similar land use,
   well construction, and well densities. Relationships between DRASTIC
   scores and incidents of contamination, however, have not been
   extensively documented. In Nebraska, significant positive correlation
   appears to exist between incidents of VOC contamination of ground-water
   supplied community water systems and the relative hydrogeologic
   vulnerability of surficial aquifers as quantified with the DRASTIC
   method. These results provide a means of verifying the usefulness of
   planning tools such as DRASTIC for identifying areas where water
   supplies are most vulnerable to contamination from surface sources.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-40}},

Abstract = {{`'No Migration'' Petitions must be submitted by operators of Class I
   hazardous disposal wells to apply for an exemption from the federal land
   ban restrictions on the disposal of hazardous waste. In many Class I
   disposal well operations, the injectate density can vary daily and
   usually has a different density than the native formation brine. The
   influence of the density contrast on the fluid potential must be
   included in a `'No Migration'' Petition modeling demonstration. After
   the model wells(s) is shut-in, the density contrast results in a net
   updip (lower density injectate) or downdip (higher density injectate)
   component of flow near the center of mass of the calculated plume
   (neglecting regional flow). In many cases, two model runs are required:
   one using the lowest anticipated injectate density and one using the
   highest anticipated injectate density for the entire modeled operational
   period. This was intended to provide adequate plume delineation over the
   injectate density range and implies that buoyancy effects on the plume
   position are not related to the average density. Three separate cases of
   a two-dimensional generic numerical model were used to examine buoyancy
   effects using constant and variable injectate density input values. Case
   1 used a random selection of the daily variation about the mean density,
   and case 2 used correlated daily injectate densities over a five day
   period. The model calculated concentrations from cases 1 and 2 were
   compared to the results from a third case that used the mean density
   input value for the entire operational period. The calculated plume
   extent for all three cases is virtually identical for simulation times
   up to 10,000 years. The modeling results demonstrate that using a
   long-term average injectate density in `'No Migration'' Petition
   modeling rather than the range of extreme values may be justifiable by
   operators of Class I injection well facilities.}},

Abstract = {{The quantification of permeability and geostatistical scaling from

   problems common to minipermeameters. In particular, errors in
   measurement of gas flow rate, calibration of flow rate meters, and
   countering pressure and temperature effects were reduced by using
   electronic mass-flow transducers. Problems of sealing the injector
   (probe) tips and of measuring the permeability of weathering rinds and
   fracture `'skins'' were remedied with a sample chamber capable of
   handling thin wafers or rock cores of arbitrary dimensions. Calibrations
   with samples of known permeability were excellent. It is now possible to
   measure permeability very accurately on weathering rinds, fracture
   surfaces, outcrops, and large hand samples.}},

Abstract = {{An approximation of the drawdown function developed by Hantush (1964)
   for late times was used to estimate the aquifer diffusivity directly
   from measured data from a constant-head pumping test. This method of
   evaluation is especially useful in cases where early time data are
   absent or are obscured by other phenomena. The use of the constant-head
   time type curves allows ambiguity in the choice of the time match point
   because of the shallow slopes of the type curves for later times.
   Using the described approximation, constant-head time type curves
   specific to the dimensionless distance from the pumping well may be
   compared with the measured data to find anomalies and bias in the
   measured data. A case study is presented to compare the results of the
   analyses with the constant-head time type curves and with the
   approximation of the drawdown function. The results show that the
   approximation is valid after the first 100 minutes of measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Based on analysis of over 300 injection-pressure tests and their
   assignment to logged stratigraphic intervals, it is argued that the
   Silurian dolomite aquifer in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, behaves as
   both a fractured and porous medium. This paradox is resolved\_by
   examining the aquifer's individual stratigraphic units and their
   respective sedimentologic characteristics. Like many carbonates, the
   aquifer contains shoaling upward sequences and cycling through a variety
   of depositional environments and textures. Most of the stratigraphic
   units are fine-grained mudstones, but interbeds with porous
   coarse-grained packstones and grainstones are also present.
   The packstone and grainstone units have unimodal distributions of
   hydraulic conductivity with geometric means between 10(-4) and 10(-3)
   cm/sec. The high matrix porosity masks any effects of jointing in these
   deposits, and they behave as porous high conductivity media. In
   contrast, hydraulic conductivities within the mudstones are bimodal,
   with one mode of very low matrix conductivities and a second higher mode
   controlled by jointing. Mudstone conductivities increase logarithmically
   with joint frequency, but never attain the magnitude of the values for
   the coarse-grained units. Because the geometric mean hydraulic
   conductivities of the porous units are up to 1000 times greater than the
   thicker mudstones, the aquifer's bulk hydraulic conductivity is
   controlled by the thinner porous zones. Therefore, as a whole, the
   aquifer behaves as a porous medium even though most of the section is
   fracture-dominated.
   Only the large number of hydraulic conductivity measurements isolated
   within specific stratigraphic units has allowed recognition of the
   importance of porous medium conditions in this aquifer. Because upward
   shoaling sequences are common within carbonates, a similar combination
   of porous and fractured medium conditions may be present, but unnoticed,
   in other carbonate aquifers. Investigators working in dolomites with
   minimal tectonic deformation should be particularly alert for porous
   medium effects.}},

Abstract = {{The salinity in the Breede River in the Robertson area (S.W. Cape, South
   Africa) has increased at an alarming rate over the past two decades.
   Water analyses have shown that a few tributary streams which drain
   Bokkeveld Shale catchments are responsible for the high salinity in this
   agriculturally important river. Research carried out to investigate the
   sources of salinity in one such catchment, the Poesjesnels River Valley,
   found that heavy salt loads were contributed by return flow seepages
   after irrigation of deeply ripped, thin soils which overlie decomposed
   shale. A smaller contribution was coming from ground water which had
   leached out some salt from these shales while moving through bedrock
   fractures under pressure from the head in the encircling mountains, and
   eventually seeped into the river; evidence for this was provided by
   comparison of the oxygen isotope ratios of the various water bodies in
   the valley with that of the river water. A salt balance model drawn up
   to differentiate between the sources of salinity gave an indication of
   the systems which need management in future hydrological and
   agricultural development in this and similar valleys.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water at many sites is contaminated by chlorinated solvents which
   are of relatively low solubility and denser than water, as well as other
   contaminants of similar properties. The presence of a dense nonaqueous
   phase liquid (DNAPL) in an aquifer can provide continued flux to the
   dissolved phase long after the initial discharge. The flux may be
   significant even when the nonaqueous phase has dispersed to a state of
   residual saturation, in which little or no free product can be detected
   or recovered. At an industrial site we required an estimate of the
   magnitude of a DNAPL source without undertaking invasive exploration. In
   theory, the presence and magnitude of a residual DNAPL source can be
   inferred from observations of downgradient concentrations by (1)
   developing an inverse modeling solution to estimate flux, and (2)
   matching estimated flux to a conceptual model of NAPL dissolution, which
   yields an estimate of residual mass. Such a method can provide a
   qualitative indication of the presence of a residual DNAPL source.
   However, the sensitivity of the solution to assumptions regarding
   physical characteristics of the source medium are such that a useful
   quantitative estimate cannot be made without observations over long
   periods of time.}},

Abstract = {{A ground-water study carried out in the Serowe area of eastern Botswana
   between 1985-1988 has provided the opportunity to evaluate the role of a
   multiparameter low-level airborne geophysical survey in a
   hydrogeological investigation. The survey included magnetic, VLF (very
   low frequency), and coaxial EM (electromagnetic) measurements. In total,
   7,500 line kilometers were flown over an area of 3,300 km2 with a
   nominal ground clearance of 20 m and a line spacing of 400 M.
   The main aquifer, the Ntane Sandstone Formation (Karoo age), is confined
   between mudstones below and basalt above, and is broken into a series of
   graben and horst structures by numerous E-W striking faults. All
   bedrock, however, is completely masked by a 20-60 m thick overburden of
   sands, calcretes, silcretes, and sandstones known collectively as the
   Kalahari beds.
   Airborne magnetic and VLF geophysical surveys have been used to
   penetrate this masking cover. Images and stacked profiles obtained from
   the survey revealed structural and geological features of major
   hydrogeological significance. This provided the information necessary
   for the formulation of a conceptual model.
   The results helped guide the subsequent exploration drilling program in
   an efficient and effective manner, cutting down the need for extensive
   ground surveys. The investigation confirmed the availability of a 35,000
   m3/day resource, sustainable for a 25-year period. Highest yields were
   obtained from fracture zones associated with VLF anomalies. Potential
   wellfields were identified in confined sections of the aquifer, with
   production boreholes to be sited, where possible, on fractures
   associated with VLF anomalies.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The formation parameters commonly determined by slug-testing a well can
   also be derived from the time-rate of recovery of the water level in the
   well following purging for a known period of time but at an unknown
   discharge rate, as is routinely done in preparation for obtaining water
   samples for laboratory analysis. By applying principles of
   superposition, recovery of a well when well-bore storage is important
   can be expressed in terms of the published large-diameter well function.
   Expressing recovery in a dimensionless form negates the need for the
   discharge rate. Using a microcomputer and simple extrapolation between
   the published solutions for the well function, type curves can be
   quickly calculated, plotted, and modified for fitting to the field data.
   Testing the formation in this manner eliminates the high gradients
   associated with slug-testing and permits maximum control over hydraulic
   stresses so that mobilization of colloids can be minimized. Also, by
   combining formation hydraulic testing with the sampling routine, a
   saving in effort and time should be realized over the traditional
   slug-test, wait-for-stabilization, purge and sample procedure. Accuracy
   of the method is at least comparable to that of a slug-test analysis for
   practical purging times.}},

   through the quartz glass into an evacuated space) was developed and used
   for the experiments.
   Results of our studies demonstrated that breakthrough curves of specific

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{108-118}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Two nuclear methods were used to quantify hydrogeologic parameters in
   the unsaturated zone of a reclaimed and revegetated coal strip mine in
   Clarion, Pennsylvania. Am-Be (neutron) and Cs-137 (gamma-gamma)
   geophysical logging tools were used to quantify volumetric moisture
   content, bulk density, total porosity, and unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity. An additional study at the same site used postsampling
   neutron activation analysis to determine concentrations of a bromide
   tracer in unsaturated zone water samples. Those additional data were
   used to independently calculate unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.
   Geophysical logging of six boreholes at the site was conducted on seven
   different dates. Temporal variations in volumetric moisture content
   versus depth were observed to be short-lived, with the general shape of
   the volumetric moisture content profiles remaining spatially stable over
   the eight month period of investigation. Bulk density values ranged from
   less than 1.14 to 1.86 g/cm3, corresponding to total porosities of
   greater than 57\% to 30.1\%. Large void spaces were encountered during
   past and present drilling and observed at a measurement point.
   Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities were calculated using draining
   profile volumetric moisture content data as input to an explicit
   numerical solution of the unsaturated flow equation. Calculated values
   ranged from 2.4 X 10(-7) to 1.5 X 10(-3) cm/s. Examination of all of the
   geophysical log data together showed sharp increases in volumetric
   moisture content spatially coincident with zones where bulk density
   increases (and porosity decreases). The bulk density contrast appears to
   be of more influence than the magnitude of the material property.
   Increased unsaturated hydraulic conductivity associated with increased
   volumetric moisture content was seen in several boreholes.
   Bromide tracer-labeled waters were collected from pressure-suction
   lysimeters installed at depths of up to 18.1 m for a period of 16
   months. Unsaturated hydraulic conductivities, calculated by interpreting
   concentration peaks as average arrival times of steadily infiltrating
   water through a uniformly porous media, ranged from 2.8 X 10(-6) to 7.2
   X 10(-5) cm/s. However, a dual-permeability mechanism is suggested by
   the observed behavior of the tracer. Analysis of the data suggests that
   fluid flow in this hydrogeologic setting is dominantly transient.
   Ground-water recharge occurs in short-lived pulses. The periodicity of
   acid mine drainage formation and flushing to the water table is expected
   to correspond to infiltration and recharge events.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical model ARMOS, which simulates areal flow of water and light
   hydrocarbon in an unconfined aquifer, is described. Based on the
   assumption of local vertical equilibrium, areal flow equations for water
   and hydrocarbon are derived which exhibit reduced dimensionality and
   nonlinearity. A finite-element method is used to solve the water and oil
   equations using an efficient semidecoupled approach. Input required by
   the model includes areal boundaries, elevations of the aquifer lower
   boundary, and initial water and hydrocarbon levels in monitoring wells.
   Soil and fluid properties include hydrocarbon density, viscosity and
   surface tension, saturated hydraulic conductivity, van Genuchten
   air-water capillary pressure curve parameters, and the maximum residual
   hydrocarbon saturations in the saturated and unsaturated zones. Fluid
   heads or fluxes may be specified on the domain perimeter and pumping
   rates are prescribed at recovery wells. The water pumping rate is
   automatically limited when drawdown reaches a pump-off set point (or the
   screen bottom), and hydrocarbon recovery is limited when well
   hydrocarbon thickness becomes zero. Model output includes water and
   hydrocarbon levels in monitoring wells, cumulative product recovery, and
   free and residual hydrocarbon volumes in the soil. A hypothetical
   problem involving optimization of free product recovery and a field
   application of the model to a large pipeline leak are described.}},

Abstract = {{The Princeton Transport Code (PTC), a three-dimensional finite-element
   flow and transport model, was used to evaluate contaminant movement and
   recovery in the vicinity of a manufacturing facility in western
   Nebraska. The modeling was complicated by seasonal recharge from a
   nearby irrigation canal, a drainage ditch flowing across the site,
   municipal wells pumping at variable rates and screened at different
   levels in the underlying semiconfined aquifer, and the pumping of the
   three high-capacity wells being used to recover contaminated ground
   water. The flow model was calibrated in several steps: steady-state
   calibration using the unstressed (no pumping) conditions; steady-state
   calibration using the prerecovery pumping conditions; and finally,
   transient calibration using results obtained for the early recovery
   pumping period-first for the nonirrigation season and then for the
   irrigation season. The calibrated flow model was further tested by
   simulating transport during the early stages of the recovery pumping.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Geological Survey's MODFLOW finite-difference ground-water flow
   model has been coupled with three surface-water packages-the MODBRANCH,
   River, and Stream packages-to simulate surface water and its interaction
   with ground water. Prior to the development of the coupling packages,
   the only interaction between these modeling packages was that leakage
   values could be passed between MODFLOW and the three surface-water
   packages. To facilitate wider and more flexible uses of the models, a
   computer program was developed and added to MODFLOW to allow direct
   flows or stages to be passed between any of the packages and MODFLOW.
   The flows or stages calculated in one package can be set as boundary
   discharges or stages to be used in another package. Several modeling
   packages can be used in the same simulation depending upon the level of
   sophistication needed in the various reaches being modeled. This
   computer program is especially useful when any of the River, Stream, or
   MODBRANCH packages are used to model a river flowing directly into or
   out of wetlands in direct connection with the aquifer and represented in
   the model as an aquifer block. A field case study is shown to illustrate
   an application.}},

Abstract = {{Localized ground-water mounding beneath larger on-site sewage disposal
   fields (septic drain fields) can reduce and even eliminate the
   waste-water treatment that occurs in the unsaturated soil zone. Such
   mounding was previously predicted for longer times by a procedure of
   uncertain accuracy and having a number of limitations. In this paper, a
   new procedure is developed on a stronger theoretical basis. The
   governing equation may be solved by four different methods. The new
   procedure considerably extends the time range of applicability, and no
   longer restricts the proportions of the rectangular disposal field.
   Errors in the previous methods approached 20\% in some cases.
   Comparisons of different methods to reduce mound heights where they are
   critical indicate that the most effective method is to subdivide the
   disposal field into separated subareas.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{890-895}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a subset of the family of diagonally implicit
   Runge-Kutta (DIRK) time-stepping methods for finite-difference models of
   parabolic (diffusion-like) equations. It includes the
   first-order-accurate Euler implicit (backward in time, DIRK1) and the
   second-order Crank-Nicolson (DIRK2) methods as special cases. It
   combines a series of DIRK1 partial time steps so as to eliminate
   additional power terms of the time step DELTAt, in the local error, by
   the number of partial steps used. This offers a large increase in
   computational efficiency, going from a DIRK1 to a DIRK2 method, and
   improves on the Crank-Nicolson method with a better choice of
   Runge-Kutta parameters. For a linear diffusion example, an
   optimal-parameter DIRK2 method offers the same accuracy as the Euler
   implicit method at two orders of magnitude larger time step, with an
   order of magnitude better accuracy than the Crank-Nicholson method. In a
   highly nonlinear horizontal unsaturated water flow example, using eight
   simulated medium to coarse soils, a DIRK2 method produces either an
   average maximum accuracy improvement of 4.7 times over the Euler
   implicit method, without Newton or Picard iteration, or from 3.8 to 48
   times faster computer run times for the same accuracy.}},

   CONDUCTIVITY OF UNWEATHERED WISCONSIAN AGE TILL IN IOWA}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{896-904}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The low conductivity of glacial till is usually thought to preclude
   pumping tests, which has led to the predominate use of laboratory
   permeameter and single well response (slug) tests for estimating
   hydraulic conductivity. Slug tests only sample a small region around the
   well and may be more representative of the disturbance of well
   installation or development than in situ conductivity. To provide a
   larger scale comparison to slug test estimates of hydraulic conductivity
   for unweathered Wisconsin age till in Iowa, a pumping test was
   performed, with both the pumping and monitoring wells placed in
   unweathered till. Maintaining a constant drawdown of 439 cm in the
   pumping well for over five days yielded an average flowrate of only 26.3
   ml/min, but produced a maximum drawdown of 104 cm at a radial distance
   of 178 cm. Assuming radial and vertical flow, least-squares parameter
   estimation yielded a hydraulic conductivity estimate of 7.5 . 10(-7)
   cm/s and a specific storage estimate of 6.6 . 10(-6) CM-1. SlUg test
   results compared favorably, with geometric mean hydraulic conductivity
   estimates of 4.9 . 10(-7) cm/s from a Cooper et al. (1967) analysis and
   7.1 - 10(-7) cm/s from a Hvorslev (1951) analysis. For this relatively
   low clay till (20\% clay fraction), borehole smearing does not appear to
   have a significant impact on slug tests. The results indicate pumping
   tests can be performed, on an appropriate scale, in some unweathered
   tills.}},

Abstract = {{Cokriging and ordinary kriging of geoelectric and well data are used to
   determine the thickness, lateral extent, and spatial variability of a
   naturally occurring clay layer near Ashland, Nebraska. The clay layer
   that protects the underlying ground water from contaminant sources is
   defined by mapping the estimated clay thickness; variance maps provide
   an assessment of the uncertainty of the thickness estimates. Two types
   of information are combined in the cokriging procedure: clay thickness
   data estimated from drillers' logs of 128 irrigation and municipal
   supply wells, and thicknesses estimated from interpretation of 44
   vertical electrical soundings (VES); for the ordinary kriging, well data
   are used alone. Both types of maps demonstrate the existence of a
   continuous near-surface clay layer extending over much of the Ashland
   wellfield; however, the cokriged map shows much more detail in the
   central part of the study area, where the well data are undersampled.
   The relatively dense VES network in the central area provides an
   important information bridge between the northern and southern areas
   making the cokriged map more continuous and accurate than the map
   prepared using the well data alone and ordinary kriging.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory batch and column studies with two subsurface media
   demonstrated that structural isomers of rhodamine WT (RWT) are
   responsible for the observed two-step sigmoidal breakthrough curve. A
   linear isotherm was observed at RWT concentrations < 100 mug/l and a
   Freundlich isotherm was observed at concentrations > 100 mug/l. In
   column studies, the breakthrough curve for RWT was observed to exhibit a
   plateau at values of C/Co around 0.43 to 0.49. Titration curves for RWT
   indicated a single pK(a) value of 5.1. The pH effects on the
   breakthrough curve for RWT were evaluated and showed no evidences
   related to the observed two-step breakthrough curve. Sorption of RWT was
   observed to be much more significant at low values of pH (e.g., 3.0),
   and to decrease at elevated values of pH (e.g., 11.3); both observations
   are consistent with the ionogenic nature of RWT and the surface charge
   of the media. Chromatographic separation of RWT resulted in two UV
   spectrophotoscopically distinct peaks indicating two structural isomers.
   Combination of the individual breakthrough curves for each of the two
   RWT isomers resulted in a two-step breakthrough curve similar to that
   observed for the original RWT solution. The distinct sorptive
   characteristic of the different isomers is explained by the relative
   positions of two carboxyl groups (COO-) attached to the phenyl ring of
   RWT.}},

Abstract = {{The yield characteristics in clusters of closely spaced and sparsely
   spaced wells in a typical granitic environment in South India are
   analyzed. Contrary to the belief of earlier workers, the analysis shows
   that the yield of the wells is not directly influenced by depth,
   topography, number of fractures, or the thickness of weathered zones. In
   a few cases, reduction of discharges were observed at certain depths,
   and in general, ground-water yield was contributed by shallow fractured
   zones. The data were statistically processed further to quantify the
   observed relationships among these parameters. The analysis of the
   results indicated similar trends regardless of whether the wells are
   closely spaced or otherwise throughout the basin area.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate is one of the most common ground-water contaminants, and
   denitrification, the bacterially mediated conversion of nitrate into
   molecular nitrogen, is the only geochemical process that contributes
   significantly to the renovation of nitrate-contaminated aquifers.
   Previous workers have shown that denitrification occurs in some, but not
   all, nitrate-contaminated unconfined aquifers in southern Ontario,
   Canada. Denitrification tends to occur in aquifers that have a very
   shallow water table, but not in aquifers whose water table is deeper
   than about two to three meters.
   This paper describes an investigation of the importance of organic
   carbon in controlling the occurrence of denitrification in two shallow
   sandy aquifers in southern Ontario, Canada. In situ and laboratory
   measurements of denitrification rates using the acetylene block
   technique show that: (1) organic carbon availability decreases with
   depth below the ground surface; (2) denitrification occurs in an aquifer
   with a very shallow water table, but organic carbon availability limits
   the denitrification rate; and (3) denitrification does not occur in an
   aquifer with a deeper water table because there is insufficient labile
   organic carbon present.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we apply the Bayesian decision analysis to the engineering
   design of a ground-water interception well whose purpose is to capture a
   contaminant plume. Two decision variables are considered: (1) pumping
   rate of an interception well when the desired width of interception zone
   is known, and (2) optimal number of slug tests needed to estimate the
   statistics of mean log-conductivity. The optimal number of slug tests is
   calculated for the case when no prior information regarding the mean of
   log-conductivity is available. The analysis is performed for
   steady-state ground-water flow in a linear-type aquifer. Two utility
   functions are considered. The utility functions account for the risk
   associated with not capturing the contaminant plume, cost of pumping,
   and cost of aquifer testing.}},

Title = {{STOCHASTIC SIMULATION OF SOLUTE TRANSPORT IN HETEROGENEOUS FORMATIONS -
   A COMPARISON OF PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC GEOSTATISTICAL APPROACHES}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Abstract = {{The Monte Carlo simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous
   formations generates equally likely realizations of hydraulic
   conductivity using geostatistical approaches. The available field data
   on hydraulic conductivity can be classified as hard data (i.e.,
   measurements with a low degree of uncertainty) and soft data (i.e.,
   measurements with a greater degree of uncertainty). Information on
   hydraulic conductivity should be honored in the generated realizations
   in order to reduce uncertainty in the simulation. The traditional
   parametric approaches, such as the Turning Bands (TUBA) method, are
   multi-Gaussian and make it difficult (if not impossible) to include the
   use of soft data. A recently developed nonparametric geostatistical
   approach, the Sequential Indicator Simulation (SIS) method, can
   incorporate soft data easily and generate any distribution functions not
   limited by multi-Gaussian. The main goal of this paper is to investigate
   the effects of incorporating soft data on solute transport simulations
   by using SIS. Two synthetic 2-D heterogeneous reference hydraulic
   conductivity fields, one with an isotropic multi-Gaussian underlying
   model and the other with an anisotropic non-Gaussian model, are sampled
   to obtain limited hard hydraulic conductivity data and a relatively
   large number of soft data. Based on the sampled data, realizations of
   simulated hydraulic conductivity fields are generated by using SIS for
   different cases depending on whether or not the soft data are used. TUBA
   is also used to generate realizations when only the hard data are used
   for the comparisons. Solute transport results are calculated by the
   Monte Carlo method. It is shown that when only limited hard data are
   available, SIS and TUBA provide similar simulation results which in
   these cases deviate from the results of the reference fields. The main
   conclusion of this study is that, by adding a relatively large number of
   soft data, the statistical features of the reference hydraulic
   conductivity fields are better characterized and transport simulation
   results are improved significantly. The uncertainties in predictions of
   both solute arrival time and arrival position are reduced when soft data
   are included. More investigations are needed to study the effects on
   solute transport of high continuity at extreme hydraulic conductivity
   values and the effects of incorporating large amounts of soft data with
   larger degrees of uncertainty, e.g., the soft data interpreted from
   seismic lines.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of Neuman's analytical solution for flow to a well in a
   homogeneous, anisotropic, water-table aquifer commonly requires large
   amounts of computation time and can produce inaccurate results for
   selected combinations of parameters. Large computation times occur
   because the integrand of a semi-infinite integral involves the summation
   of an infinite series. Each term of the series requires evaluation of
   the roots of equations, and the series itself is sometimes slowly
   convergent. Inaccuracies can result from lack of computer precision or
   from the use of improper methods of numerical integration. In this paper
   it is proposed to use a method of numerical inversion of the Laplace
   transform solution, provided by Neuman, to overcome these difficulties.
   The solution in Laplace space is simpler in form than the real-time
   solution; that is, the integrand of the semi-infinite integral does not
   involve an infinite series or the need to evaluate roots of equations.
   Because the integrand is evaluated rapidly, advanced methods of
   numerical integration can be used to improve accuracy with an overall
   reduction in computation time. The proposed method of computing type
   curves, for which a partially documented computer program (WTAQ1) was
   written, was found to reduce computation time by factors of 2 to 20 over
   the time needed to evaluate the closed-form, real-time solution.}},

Abstract = {{In the Upper Colorado River Basin, irrigated agriculture is associated
   with increasing stream salinity. In areas targeted for control of
   salinity transport to streams, as much as 90\% of stream salinity has
   been estimated to originate from ground water flowing through
   salt-bearing stratum. Primary salt sources are the marine shales and the
   shale residuum that underlie the soils throughout much of the basin.
   Shallow subsurface flow systems, created by seepage from canals and deep
   percolation of irrigation water, are believed to be the primary agents
   leaching the salts from underlying shale deposits and carrying them to
   streams. This study attempts to determine the relative importance of
   advective, dispersive, and diffusive salt transport processes from the
   alluvium covered, shale hillslopes of the region. The results of various
   irrigation management schemes for appraising the possibility of
   controlling salt loading to streams are presented.}},

Abstract = {{A flow-cell assembly was constructed to collect biofilm samples on glass
   slides in an effort to monitor Fe-precipitating microorganisms in water
   wells. The flow-cell was used with a once-flow-through connection to
   municipal-water wells which had previous histories of Fe-related
   precipitation and biofouling problems. Microscopic observations of
   biofilms attached to glass slides confirmed the presence of stalked and
   sheathed bacteria believed to be involved in Fe(III)-precipitation.
   Scanning electron microscopy confirmed that biofilm samples contained
   Gallionella-type morphological features composed of helical,
   intertwisted stalks. Attempts to recover these organisms with cultural
   methods were unsuccessful. For monitoring Fe-precipitating
   microorganisms, a differential solid medium was developed from the
   general-purpose heterotrophic platecount medium (R2A) by incorporating
   ferric ammonium citrate in the formulation. Organisms capable of using
   citrate in the modified medium yielded rust-colored colonies due to the
   formation of Fe(III)-precipitates. These Fe-precipitating bacteria did
   not possess stalks, sheaths, or other appendages, and their presence
   could not be predicted from microscopic examination of the sample
   materials. Optical measurement of biofilm thickness was deemed
   unreliable because of large variation in the thickness of
   Fe(III)-precipitation and associated bacterial attachment.
   Fe(III)-precipitates were identified as ferrihydrite, a poorly
   crystalline Fe(III)-oxide. Laboratory studies with amended well-water
   samples recirculating through a flow-cell were used to enrich for
   organisms involved in biofouling communities. These experiments yielded
   methylotrophic organisms capable of growing with methanol and
   methylamine, and they were classified as Hyphomicrobium spp.}},
