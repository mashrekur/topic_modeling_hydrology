Abstract = {{Concentrations of the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) CFC-11 and CFC-12 were
   determined in groundwater from coastal plain sediments of the Delmarva
   Peninsula. CFC-modeled ages were calculated independently for CFC-11 and
   CFC-12, and agreed to within 2-3 years in the majority of the waters.
   Recharge temperatures, determined from dissolved nitrogen and argon
   concentrations, varied from 9 +/- 2-degrees-C over most of the peninsula
   to 14 +/- 2-degrees-C at the southernmost tip of the peninsula in
   Virginia. The CFC-modeled ages were examined in relation to the known
   hydrogeologic environment, both on regional scales and in more
   intensively sampled local scale networks. The CFC-modeled recharge years
   and measured tritium concentrations were used to reconstruct a tritium
   input function that was compared to the modeled tritiUM plus He-3
   distribution. Most of the present distribution of tritium in Delmarva
   groundwater is consistent with low dispersivities. The results of the
   study strongly support the use of CFCs for dating shallow, aerobic
   groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation measurements were used to identify
   different characteristic porosity domains in soil and aquifer materials.
   The porosity distribution can be inferred from these measurements by a
   regularization method applicable to any nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   relaxation, or by an analytic method applicable only to multiexponential
   relaxations (D'Orazio et al., 1989). The porosity distribution obtained
   from NMR relaxation measurements strongly depends on the pore shape
   factor. For the Borden aquifer material, both the regularized and the
   analytic pore size distribution obtained from NMR relaxation
   measurements are consistent with those obtained by Ball et al. (1990)
   using Hg porosimetry and N2 adsorption. For the Eustis and the Webster
   soils, the measured porosity domains are qualitatively consistent with
   those expected based on their respective composition. Our findings
   suggest that due to the long time required to saturate fine pores, NMR
   measurements of porosity distribution that are collected at short
   saturation times are biased toward larger pore sizes.}},

Abstract = {{The water flow mte and tracer distribution has been studied in a
   fracture zone and averagely fractured rock in the Stripa underground
   research laboratory. The experimental site is located in granitic rock
   at a depth of 385 m below the ground surface. A 50-m-long drift with a
   diameter of 3 m was excavated. The drift was intersected by a 6-m-wide
   fracture zone. The upper part of the drift was covered by 150 plastic
   sheets in which water was collected. The water in the lower part of the
   drift was collected in sump holes. Different tracers were injected in
   seven locations at distances between 9.5 and 25 m from the drift. More
   than 50\% of the water was found in one sampling area in the drift, and
   more than 90\% in only eight sampling areas. The recovery of the tracers
   was also concentrated in a few sheets. Most of the flow preferentially
   takes place in a few paths. Two sets of tracers were used in tandem; one
   set of dyes which had previously been used in Stripa and one set of
   lanthanide-DTPA complexes. Although shown to be nonsorbing in long-time
   high-sensitivity laboratory tests, the dyes were found to have a
   somewhat smaller recovery than the metal tracers. This observation was
   used in an attempt to estimate the flow-wetted surface into which the
   dyes can diffuse and sorb. The flow porosity was estimated from the
   tracer residence times for all injection points. The flow in the
   intersected fracture zone is not like that in a porous medium; it is
   highly channeled.}},

Abstract = {{A field tracer experiment was conducted in a lateral flow field in the
   weathered and highly fractured upper 6 m of a 40-m-thick clay-rich till
   plain in southwestern Ontario. In the upper 3 m where fractures are
   closely spaced (<0.13 m) the advancing front (C/C0 = 0.01) of the
   nonreactive solute tracers, bromide and O-18, migrated at rates of 0.01
   to 0.07 m/d, over distances of 4 and 6 m and under a lateral hydraulic
   gradient of 0.24. In this same zone, two strains of colloid-sized
   bacteriophage tracers migrated at rates of 2 to > 5 m/d. Simulations
   with a discrete fracture/porous matrix flow and transport model, which
   used the cubic law for flow in fractures, showed that diffusion of the
   solutes, but not the much larger colloids, into the matrix pore water
   between fractures is sufficient to cause the observed difference in
   solute and colloid transport rates. Transport-derived and hydraulic
   conductivity-derived fracture aperture values were similar, within a
   factor of 3 and falling mainly within a range of 5-40 mum. In the upper
   3 m the solute tracers were evenly distributed between pore water in the
   fractures and the matrix, and as a result, solute transport can be
   closely approximated with an equivalent porous medium (EPM) approach.
   Below this depth, fractures are more widely spaced (0.13 to > 1 m) with
   concentration peaks tending to occur near visible fractures, and solute
   transport cannot be adequately described with an EPM approach.}},

Abstract = {{Catchments are more spatially variable than catchment models assume them
   to be. Does spatial heterogeneity undermine the validity of spatially
   aggregated catchment geochemical models? Here we test whether catchment
   spatial heterogeneity invalidates a recently proposed technique that
   uses the bulk chemistry of runoff to predict how key water quality
   variables (e.g., titratable alkalinity and concentrations of base
   cations, hydrogen ions, and inorganic aluminum) will respond to changes
   in stream water in acid anion concentrations. We show that these
   predictions are valid for hypothetical heterogeneous catchments, created
   by mathematically `'mixing'' measured runoff chemistry data from
   chemically diverse streams. The chemical information in the combined
   runoff yields reliable acidification predictions, without any direct
   information concerning either the runoff chemistries of the individual
   source streams or the geochemical properties of their catchments. These
   results show that catchment acid buffering can be predicted directly
   from runoff chemistry in spatially heterogeneous catchments, even if the
   individual source regions cannot be identified and their geochemical
   characteristics are unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Geochemical reactions and hydrologic regime both affect runoff chemistry
   in many catchments. Each factor can obscure the effects of the other.
   This complicates efforts to interpret and predict catchments'
   geochemical and hydrological behavior. Here we present simple empirical
   techniques for separating effects of discharge fluctuations and effects
   of changes in acid anion concentrations in catchment monitoring data. We
   illustrate these techniques with data from central Ontario.
   Statistically subtracting acid anion effects reveals that important
   water quality variables (e.g., sum of base cations, acid neutralizing
   capacity, H+, Al(i)) are simple functions of the logarithm of catchment
   discharge. Likewise, correcting for discharge effects reveals that these
   water quality variables are roughly linear functions of runoff acid
   anion concentrations. The linear functions linking acid anion
   concentrations to water quality can be reliably predicted from bulk
   catchment runoff chemistry. Therefore acid anions' effects on water
   quality can be reliably predicted, even if they are obscured by
   discharge fluctuations in catchment monitoring data.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for identifying the size, or scale, of hillslopes and the extent
   of channel networks from digital elevation models (DEMs) are examined
   critically. We show that a constant critical support area, the method
   most commonly used at present for channel network extraction from DEMs,
   is more appropriate for depicting the hillslope/valley transition than
   for identifying channel heads. Analysis of high-resolution DEMs confirms
   that a constant contributing area per unit contour length defines the
   extent of divergent topography, or the hillslope scale, although there
   is considerable variance about the average value. In even moderately
   steep topography, however, a DEM resolution finer than the typical 30 m
   by 30 m grid size is required to accurately resolve the hillslope/valley
   transition. For many soil-mantled landscapes, a slope-dependent critical
   support area is both theoretically and empirically more appropriate for
   defining the extent of channel networks. Implementing this method for
   overland flow erosion requires knowledge of an appropriate
   proportionality constant for the drainage area-slope threshold
   controlling channel initiation. Several methods for estimating this
   constant from DEM data are examined, but acquisition of even limited
   field data is recommended. Finally, the hypothesis is proposed that an
   inflection in the drainage area-slope relation for mountain drainage
   basins reflects a transition from steep debris flow-dominated channels
   to lower-gradient alluvial channels.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed laser-Doppler velocity and Reynolds stress measurements over
   fixed two-dimensional bed forms are used to investigate the coupling
   between the mean flow and turbulence and to examine effects that play a
   role in producing the bed form instability and finite amplitude
   stability. The coupling between the mean flow and the turbulence is
   explored in both a spatially averaged sense, by determining the
   structure of spatially averaged velocity and Reynolds stress profiles,
   and a local sense, through computation of eddy viscosities and length
   scales. The measurements show that there is significant interaction
   between the internal boundary layer and the overlying wake turbulence
   produced by separation at the bed form crest. The interaction produces
   relatively low correlation coefficients in the internal boundary layer,
   which suggests that using local bottom stress to predict bed load flux
   may not only be erroneous, it may also disregard the essence of the bed
   form instability mechanism. The measurements also indicate that
   topographically induced acceleration over the bed form stoss slope has a
   more significant effect in damping the turbulence over bed forms than
   was previously supposed, which is hypothesized to play a role in the
   stabilization of fully developed bed forms.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic approach is developed to estimate the probability of wet
   days, and the mean and standard deviation of local daily nonzero
   precipitation reflecting global climate change scenarios. The approach
   is based on the analysis of daily atmospheric circulation patterns (CPs)
   and the linkage between types of CPs and daily precipitation. Three CP
   data sets are used for the 500-hPa pressure field: 40-year historical,
   10-year 1 X CO2, and 10-year 2 X CO2 scenarios obtained from the
   atmospheric general circulation model of the Canadian Climate Centre. CP
   types obtained by clustering techniques and their frequency distribution
   are similar for the three data sets. The linkage between CP types and
   precipitation considers an additional variable, the spatial average
   pressure height within each CP type. The difference in pressure heights
   among the three CP data sets makes it possible to estimate the effect of
   global change on local precipitation statistics. Under the dry
   continental climate of eastern Nebraska the effect of 2 X CO2 scenario
   on local precipitation regime is spatially variable and significant: the
   number of wet days slightly decreases but both the mean and variance of
   daily precipitation increase resulting in a more variable precipitation
   regime.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares two approaches for implementing reservoir operating
   policies derived using stochastic dynamic Programming (SDP) models. In
   particular, operating policies for the Shasta-Trinity system in Northern
   California are generated using SDP algorithms that employ either
   multilinear or multidimensional piecewise cubic functions to approximate
   the cost-to-go function. Release decisions in the simulations are then
   determined by either (1) interpolating in the policy tables or (2)
   reoptimizing the policy within the simulation, using the cost-to-go
   function generated by the SDP. The impact on simulated system
   performance of several discretization and interpolation schemes in the
   SDP is also evaluated. Reoptimizing the policy when a decision is made
   within the simulation resulted in better system performance,
   particularly when severe penalties were incurred for water and power
   shortages and coarse discretizations were employed in the SDP.}},

Abstract = {{A local flood warning system typically serves a small community situated
   in a headwater area and exposed to flash floods or rapid riverine
   floods. Forecasts of such flood events are characterized by short lead
   times and large uncertainties, A Bayesian theory is formulated for a
   local flood warning system built of three functional components:
   monitor, forecaster, and decider. The theory offers a modeling framework
   and mathematical concepts necessary for (1) developing optimal decision
   rules for issuing warnings based on imperfect forecasts, (2) evaluating
   system performance statistically, and (3) computing the ex ante economic
   benefits from a system.}},

Abstract = {{After more than 40 years the so-called Hurst effect remains an open
   problem in stochastic hydrology. Historically, its existence has been
   explained either by preasymptotic behavior of the rescaled adjusted
   range R(n){*}, certain classes of nonstationarity in time series,
   infinite memory, or erroneous estimation of the Hurst exponent. Various
   statistical tests to determine whether an observed time series exhibits
   the Hurst effect are presented. The tests are based on the fact that for
   the family of processes in the Brownian domain of attraction,
   R(n){*}/((thetan))1/2 converges in distribution to a nondegenerate
   random variable with known distribution (functional central limit
   theorem). The scale of fluctuation theta, defined as the sum of the
   correlation function, plays a key role. Application of the tests to
   several geophysical time series seems to indicate that they do not
   exhibit the Hurst effect, although those series have been used as
   examples of its existence, and furthermore the traditional pox diagram
   method to estimate the Hurst exponent gives values larger than 0.5. It
   turned out that the coefficient in the relation of R(n){*} versus n,
   which is directly proportional to the scale of fluctuation, was more
   important than the exponent. The Hurst effect motivated the
   popularization of 1/f noises and related ideas of fractals and scaling.
   This work illustrates how delicate the procedures to deal with infinity
   must be.}},

Abstract = {{Perceptions of drinking water quality were measured for residents at
   four locations in Western Australia. The total dissolved solid levels
   for the locations varied. Four scales of drinking water satisfaction
   were measured: acceptability of water quality; water quality risk
   judgment; perception of neighborhood water quality; and attitudes toward
   fluoride as an additive. Responses to each of these scales did not
   appear to be highly related to total dissolved solids. The relationship
   between attitudes toward water quality and a variety of psychological,
   attitudinal, experiential, and demographic variables was investigated.
   It was found that responses to the acceptability of water quality and
   water quality risk judgment scales related to perceived credibility of
   societal institutions and feelings of control over water quality and
   environmental problems. For the remaining two scales few significant
   correlations were found. The results support those who advocate
   localized information and involvement campaigns on drinking water
   quality issues.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive estimation scheme is used to obtain the integral scale and
   variance of the log-fluctuating conductivity at the Cape Cod site based
   on the fast Fourier transform/stochastic model of Deng et al. (1993) and
   a Kalmanlike filter. The Iter incorporates prior estimates of the unkown
   parameters with tracer moment data to adaptively obtain improved
   estimates as the tracer evolves.  The results show that significant
   improvement in the prior estimates of the conductivity can lead to
   substantial improvement in the ability to predict plume movement. The
   structure of the covariance function of the log-fluctuating conductivity
   can be identified from the robustness of the estimation. Both the
   longitudinal and transverse spatial moment data are important to the
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{A first-order analytical solution for the transport of reactive solutes
   in physically and chemically heterogeneous porous media is derived and
   discussed. The solution relies on the assumption of chemical activity
   described by the local linear equilibrium assumption postulating the
   existence of a (spatially variable) retardation factor.  Retardation
   factors and log permeabilities modeling heterogeneities are described
   statistically by random space functions with assigned correlation
   structure. Correlated as well as uncorrelated physical and chemical
   heterogeneities are studied. The analytical expressions derived reduce
   to Dagan's classic solution for the case of nonreactive solute transport
   and obey asymptotic limits already known from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to assess dispersion of
   reactive solutes in two-dimensional physically and chemically
   heterogeneous porous media, using random fields with assigned
   correlation structure for hydraulic conductivity and linear adsorption
   coefficient. Conditions under which linearization of adsorption is valid
   are discussed. Lognormal distributions of hydraulic conductivity and
   adsorption coefficient were assumed. Calculations have been performed
   for positive and negative correlation between hydraulic conductivity and
   adsorption coefficient, and for uncorrelated cases. Effects of varying
   different properties including mean and average sorption coefficient,
   physical and chemical integral scale, and variance of hydraulic
   conductivity on dispersive behavior are shown. A larger mean sorption
   coefficient enhances plume spreading in uncorrelated and in negatively
   correlated cases. In positively correlated cases, counteracting effects
   of physical and chemical heterogeneity play an important role. The
   outcome of these counteracting effects depends on the mean, variance,
   and integral scales of the spatially variable properties. The analytical
   solutions, derived in paper 1 (Bellin et al., this issue), reveal a good
   agreement with the numerical results in a significant range of
   heterogeneities. The generally surprisingly good agreement of the
   analytical solutions with the numerically obtained results can possibly
   be attributed to opposing effects of nonlinearities neglected in the
   derivation of the analytical solutions. In the case of strong physical
   heterogeneity the analytical solutions perform slightly better than in
   the case of strong chemical heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation rates of benzene, p-xylene, naphthalene, and
   o-dichlorobenzene have been measured in a heterogeneous, unconfined
   aquifer during a pulse injection experiment at Columbus Air Force Base,
   Columbus, Mississippi. Dissolved oxygen in the pulse plume maintained
   aerobic conditions. Degradation kinetics calculated from the complete
   field data set were approximately first order with the following rate
   constants: benzene, 0.0070 d-1; p-xylene, 0.0107 d-1; naphthalene,
   0.0064 d-1; and o-dichlorobenzene, 0.0046 d-1. Reaction rates were also
   calculated from a near-field subset of the data using a model based on
   the hydrologic characteristics of the aquifer. Shapes of the degradation
   rate curves were consistent with microbial degradation processes.
   Maximum degradation rates obtained are presumed to be characteristic of
   the microbial population metabolism. Carbon 14-labeled p-xylene was
   included in the injection solution to permit detection of degradation
   products. This technique is suggested for future field experiments,

Abstract = {{Steady water flow takes place in a heterogeneous aquifer of a
   three-dimensional random stationary log conductivity of anisotropic,
   axisymmetric covariance. The latter has different vertical and
   horizontal integral scales of anisotropy ratio e. The mean flow is
   uniform in the horizontal plane. A solute plume of constant
   concentration is injected instantaneously in the formation. The plume is
   characterized by the expected values of its spatial moments: mass,
   centroid coordinates, and tensor of second spatial moment. Under ergodic
   conditions, assumed to prevail, the one-realization spatial moments are
   approximately equal to their ensemble means. By adopting a first-order
   approximation in the log conductivity variance and with neglect of
   pore-scale dispersion, the spatial moments of a plume of a conservative
   solute were evaluated in the past as functions of the transport time or
   distance from the input zone (Dagan, 1988) by a Lagrangian approach. The
   moments were expressed in terms of a quadrature that had to be evaluated
   numerically. The present study generalizes these results to a reactive
   solute which undergoes kinetically controlled sorption, according to a
   linear relationship. The reaction depends on two coefficients: a
   reaction time t(r) and an equilibrium partition coefficient K(d), which
   are assumed to be constant. The solution of the transport problem is
   obtained by the Lagrangian approach, generalizing the one applied
   previously to conservative solutes. In the latter case, solute particles
   follow those of the fluid, whereas a wake of solute is left behind in
   the case of sorption. The zero-order spatial moment, the plume mass, the
   first-order approximation, and the centroid coordinates are determined
   in an analytical form. They depend only on the mean velocity and on the
   reaction coefficients. The second-order longitudinal moment,
   characterizing dispersion with respect to the centroid, is made up from
   terms depending only on the reaction and on an interactive term which
   depends also on heterogeneity. The latter is effectively derived by a
   double quadrature as well as by an analytical approximate expression,
   presented here for the first time. The transverse spatial moments
   contain only interaction terms. The third spatial moment, characterizing
   the asymmetry of the plume, is also evaluated. Simple asymptotic results
   are presented for the cases of (1) large transport time reaction time
   ratio, resulting in retardation, (2) large transport time heterogeneity
   characteristic time ratio, for which the longitudinal transport of the
   conservative solute is `'Fickian,'' and (3) the joint limit, resulting
   also in a `'Fickian'' regime.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic method for sampling spatially distributed contaminant level
   is presented. The purpose of sampling is to partition the contaminated
   region into zones of high and low pollutant concentration levels.  In
   particular, given an initial set of observations of a contaminant within
   a site, it is desired to find a set of additional sampling locations in
   a way that takes into consideration the spatial variability
   characteristics of the site and optimizes certain objective functions
   emerging from the physical, regulatory and monetary considerations of
   the specific site cleanup process. Since the interest is in classifying
   the domain into zones above and below a pollutant threshold level, a
   natural criterion is the cost of misclassification. The resulting
   objective function is the expected value of a spatial loss function
   associated with sampling. Stochastic expectation involves the joint
   probability distribution of the pollutant level and its estimate, where
   the latter is calculated by means of spatial estimation techniques.
   Actual computation requires the discretization of the contaminated
   domain. As a consequence, any reasonably sized problem results in
   combinatorics precluding an exhaustive search. The use of an annealing
   algorithm, although suboptimal, can find a good set of future sampling
   locations quickly and efficiently. In order to obtain insight about the
   parameters and the computational requirements of the method, an example
   is discussed in detail. The implementation of spatial sampling design in
   practice will provide the model inputs necessary for waste site
   remediation, groundwater management, and environmental decision making.}},

   provide justification for the use of a fractal scaling law to

   discussed is applied to experimental data to generate a `'fractal porous
   medium'' and to solve the associated flow and tracer transport problems.
   Tracer breakthrough curves are computed for three different breakthrough
   distances. An advection-dispersion matrix diffusion model, a channeling
   model, and a channel-network model are used to assess objectively the
   relative contributions of Fickian dispersal processes and channeling
   within simulated tracer transport through the fractal medium. The
   results reveal early breakthrough is fast-channel dominated, while later

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation was used to study steady liquid water movement in a
   5-m by 5-m vertical section containing a hypothetical fracture network
   under conditions of variable saturation. The fracture network was
   assumed to be embedded within an impermeable rock matrix. Three
   variations of a network were considered. The `'mixed'' network consisted
   of two fracture sets, a subvertical set containing five 125 mum average
   aperture fractures and a subhorizontal set containing four 25 mum
   average aperture fractures. The other two networks had identical
   fracture orientation and contained either all 125 mum or all 25 mum
   average aperture fractures. The TOUGH simulator was used to calculate
   the total steady liquid water flux through the network, the flux through
   individual fracture segments, and the pressure head at each fracture
   segment. A unit hydraulic gradient was imposed on the network by
   applying fixed pressure head boundaries (ranging from -0.25 to 0.0 m of
   water) of equal value to the top and bottom. Saturation and permeability
   versus pressure head relations for the two sets of fractures were
   determined with the VSFRAC model, which assumed that aperture was
   variable within an individual fracture. Results showed that the spatial
   distributions of pressure head and flux within the network, as well as
   the location of the dominant pathways, depended strongly on the
   prescribed boundary pressure head. For the mixed network, both pressure
   head and flux tended to become more spatially uniform when the boundary
   pressure head approached the pressure head at which the permeability
   thickness products of the large- and small-aperture fractures are equal
   (the crossover pressure head). These results imply that for systems
   similar to the one considered here, interpretation of actual
   measurements of pressure head and flux may be quite complex, and that
   representation of variably saturated fracture networks as an equivalent
   continuum may be more valid for some ranges in pressure head than for
   others. Equivalent permeability as a function of pressure head was
   calculated for the fracture network, illustrating how information
   collected on individual fractures may be used to estimate the flow
   properties of rock at larger scales.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivity values were compared based on alternative
   analyses of data from disc tension infiltrometers. The first method was
   based on a single disc and tension and depends on the estimate of
   sorptivity and steady state flow. A second method used steady state flow
   measurements for two different disc radii, 52 and 118 mm. A third method
   used a single disc with multiple tensions from which steady state flow
   was obtained at three or more tensions which could be at the same
   location. A fourth method used a single disc with two tensions from
   which steady state flow was obtained at two tensions, Finally, values
   based on soil cores were compared. The results show reasonable agreement
   between methods for the hydraulic conductivity with the largest
   differences for data collected for zero tension. For the most part,
   there were no significant differences in hydraulic conductivity due to
   the disc infiltrometer radius. A single-disc method with multiple
   tensions (more than 3 points) and large disc radius gave results which
   were the most stable, accurate, and repeatable.}},

Abstract = {{In the first paper of this series (Rubin and Or, 1993) we developed a
   stochastic model predicting spatial moments of soil water matric
   potential psi and saturation S under conditions of unsaturated steady
   state flow as function of the spatial moments of log saturated hydraulic
   conductivity Y, capillarity index alpha, and plant rooting depth delta.
   In this study, we investigate the ability of the proposed parallel
   columns model to reconstruct two-dimensional flow solutions, and apply
   the model to spatial estimation using the geostatistical formalism. A
   finite difference numerical scheme was developed to solve the
   two-dimensional Richards equation in heterogeneous flow domain and
   obtain detailed images of the spatial distribution of psi and S and
   their moments. Two-dimensionally-based images representing `'true''
   distributions of psi and S in a vertical cross section (x-z plane) of
   laterally heterogeneous soil were used in a synthetic spatial estimation
   problem for comparison with the one-dimensionally-based solution and
   with kriging estimates. The results show that (1) the means of psi and S
   were practically identical for the one- and two-dimensional solutions;
   (2) psi variance obtained from the two-dimensional solution was smaller
   than the one-dimensional, whereas S variance was larger in the
   two-dimensional case; (3) a smoothing of psi under two-dimensional flow
   regime resulted in spatial covariance function of a Bessel type, whereas
   two-dimensional spatial covariance of S exhibited a steep decay near its
   origin denoting spatial discontinuity; (4) the least smoothing of psi
   was observed near the surface where nearly one-dimensional conditions
   exist; (5) during transient flow, spatial covariances assume their
   steady state form quite rapidly; (6) spatial covariances predicted by
   the parallel columns model provided good estimates at unmeasured
   locations with conservative confidence regions for psi estimation and
   less conservative for S estimation; and (7) analytically predicted
   spatial covariances provide a means for network design.}},

Abstract = {{In the analytic element method, regional groundwater flow is modeled by
   superposition of particular solutions to the governing differential
   equation. The domain of the solutions is the x, y plane with the
   possible exception of isolated points. The solutions are referred to as
   analytic elements and represent a feature of flow in the aquifer, such
   as a well or the leakage through an aquitard. The analytic element
   method was originally developed for regional steady groundwater flow. In
   this paper the method is extended to transient flow. Several transient
   analytic elements and a method of determining a transient solution are
   presented. The governing differential equation that is used is the heat
   equation in two spatial dimensions with a sink term. Solutions for a
   transient well and a transient line sink are available in the
   literature. Both have a discharge that is equal to zero before the
   starting time and has a constant value after the starting time. A
   solution for a transient area sink is presented that also has a constant
   strength after the starting time. The area sink is a polygon with an
   extraction inside that is constant in space. A validation of the
   approach presented here is obtained by comparison with an exact solution
   for a case of one-dimensional transient groundwater flow. The domain is
   semi-infinite with a prescribed head at one side. Initially, the water
   is at rest, and then the head is suddenly raised at the boundary. The
   use of the transient analytic element method is illustrated by an
   example model with analytic elements both for steady and for transient
   flow. The former elements represent the initial steady state. The
   transient elements simulate variations of the groundwater flow due to
   seasonal variations in recharge and pumping.}},

Abstract = {{A computationally efficient, yet relatively simple Eulerian-Lagrangian
   method is proposed for solving the one-dimensional convection-dispersion
   solute transport equation assuming a steady or transient velocity field.
   The method uses a modified single-step reverse particle tracking (MSRPT)
   technique to handle steep concentration fronts. The scheme utilizes two
   weighting factors to control the movement of particles during a backward
   tracking step. One weighting factor greater than unity is used in the
   upstream region of the convection front, while another weighting factor
   less than unity is taken in the downstream region. The two factors were
   related empirically to the grid Peclet and Courant numbers. The MSRPT
   technique is carried out only within the concentration plume at each
   time step. For transient flow fields, the weighting factors were
   determined using an automatically adjustable procedure based on mass
   balance errors. The MSRPT method maintains the advantages of the
   traditional single-step reverse particle tracking (SRPT) procedure,
   i.e., producing efficient and oscillation-free calculations, but
   circumvents numerical dispersion introduced by SRPT. A large number of
   tests against analytical solutions for one-dimensional transport in
   uniform flow fields indicate that the proposed method can handle the
   entire range of Peclet numbers from zero to infinity. Numerical tests
   also show that the MSRPT method is a relatively accurate, efficient and
   mass-conservative algorithm for solute transport in transient flow
   fields. The Courant number at present cannot exceed 1. The MSRPT
   approach was found especially useful for convection-dominated problems;

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation of flow through multidimensional heterogeneous
   soils under unsaturated conditions is a computationally intensive task.
   The governing unsaturated flow equation is nonlinear. The degree of
   nonlinearity depends on the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the soil
   and the degree of heterogeneity. In this paper, we present a highly
   efficient method to simulate unsaturated steady state flow through
   random porous media. Our method utilizes the analytical (approximate)
   solution derived by a perturbation-spectral method as an initial guess
   solution for a numerical model to simulate two-dimensional vertical
   infiltration problems. It is found that this approach, which we call
   `'ASIGNing,'' reduces the required CPU time by one to two orders of
   magnitude. ASIGNing is demonstrated to operate successfully under a wide
   variety of boundary conditions which may substantially deviate from
   those imposed on the initial guess solution. A large range of mean and
   variances in the independent variables ln K(s) and alpha or
   alternatively ln alpha has been tested and it is shown that the method
   works well for variances of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity
   sigma(ln K')2 less-than-or-equal-to 5 and average {[}alpha]
   less-than-or-equal-to 0.1 {[}cm-1].}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivities of a portion of the Twin Lake aquifer are
   derived from grain size analyses performed at 3-cm vertical sampling
   intervals in four boreholes, spaced 1 m apart. Correlation of
   conductivity logs between four boreholes leads to a geometrical model
   which corresponds closely to the spatial structure derived from the
   velocity field of previous tracer tests. Histogram and correlogram
   analyses of conductivities agree closely with those of velocities, and
   the two data sets appear equally useful for characterizing the aquifer
   and its spatial variability. Using Darcy's law, flow velocities and
   conductivities are combined to calculate a theoretical, hydraulic
   gradient. Comparison to gradients observed at the site reveals agreement
   on a large scale. However, differences exist in detail because observed
   piezometric heads fail to reflect small-scale heterogeneity. Since these
   differences are significant for contaminant transport prediction, it is
   recommended for future studies to directly measure flow velocities from
   a tracer experiment, rather than to reply on head measurements and on
   Darcy's law for the calculation of transport parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of monthly temperature (T) and
   precipitation (P) time series at 28 climatologic stations on the
   storm-facing slope of the Wasatch Range, Utah. The goal is to examine
   the space-time structure of T and P and to develop an empirical model
   incorporating both seasonal and elevation effects. Each time series (T
   or P) is decomposed into the sum of a long-term mean, a seasonal cycle,
   and a residual random process. The seasonal cycle is well determined by
   the amplitude and phase of a few harmonics, and the residual noise is
   approximated by a power law form of the variance spectrum. Empirical
   correlations are found relating the temporal moments of altitude,
   allowing the construction of a parametric T-P model as a function of
   altitude and season. The observed correlations are discussed within the
   context of the region's synoptic weather patterns. When combined with
   digital elevation data, the model can be used to estimate seasonal
   temperature and precipitation fields as input to mountain front
   hydrologic studies.}},

Abstract = {{Large amplitude river meanders have been observed to contain multiple
   bars within a single loop and to exhibit planforms that are asymmetric
   or have subsidiary bends. Here we report experiments conducted in
   symmetric sine-generated meanders of large amplitude which document the
   bed topography, flow patterns, and sediment transport fields in such
   bends. Multiple pools spaced at a distance of 3-4 widths develop
   successively along the outer concave bank. Downstream of each pool a
   distinct bar lies along the inside convex bank. The series of bars
   overlap and appear shingled downstream; the leading edge of each bar is
   oblique to the channel trace and curves toward the inside bank. The
   first and most pronounced pool, opposite the first inner bank bar, is
   consistently positioned where the projection of the inner bank tangent
   at the upstream crossing intersects the outer bank. Successive shingled
   bars in the bend migrate downstream if bars arriving at the persistent
   first pool deliver large enough pulses of sediment to the pool to form
   new bars. In experiments with an erodible bank, the banks near pools are
   sites of accelerated retreat. This suggests that the shear stress fields
   engendered by these multiple features may cause the planimetric
   distortion seen in larger rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Large-amplitude river meanders develop multiple scour holes within a
   single bend that are observed to be part of overlapping shingle bars
   (Whiting and Dietrich, this issue). These bars, having wavelengths near
   4 channel widths, consist of a pool along the outer concave bank and a
   depositional lobe along the inner convex bank. The development of
   multiple pools and lobes within a bend has been shown to cause localized
   bank erosion and channel trace distortion expressed as planform
   asymmetry and compound heads. In this second paper we describe
   experiments designed specifically to test hypotheses that propose
   multiple pools to be the result of an overshoot phenomenon, to be a
   consequence of an alternate bar-like instability, or to develop from a
   flow/planform instability. Although our experiments favor the hypothesis
   that multiple bars in bends of large amplitude arise from an alternate
   bar-like instability, experiments conducted over an immobile flat bed
   also reveal longitudinal oscillations in flow that may arise in these
   long bends. This secondary effect interacts with shingle bars to amplify
   pool expression at particular points along the channel.}},

   under equilibrium sediment transport, feed rate was reduced in two steps
   to one third and one tenth the initial rate as discharge was held
   constant. The primary response following both reductions was an increase
   in bed surface particle size as a corridor of intensive bed load
   transport contracted and local transport rates decreased. After the
   first feed rate reduction, the channel incised by twice the mean water
   depth, on average, and caused distal bar surfaces to emerge as

Abstract = {{The grain roughness of stable armored beds that formed in a laboratory
   flume under a range of steady flow conditions on rounded, flat and
   angular gravel is analyzed. Gravel roughness geometry is determined from
   bed surface profiles and vertical photographs. These techniques have
   been employed in field situations. Thus the methodology is potentially
   applicable to the analysis of grain roughness in natural gravel bed
   channels. The description of representative roughness geometry is also
   analogous to that used to characterize artificial roughness arrays.
   Armor roughness increases with increasing flow. Armored surfaces
   composed of angular gravel are roughest, and surfaces formed of flat
   gravel offer least resistance to the flow. Stable armored beds may
   exhibit a tendency to maximize the ratio of the shear due to drag on
   representative roughness elements to total shear. Roughness
   concentration is strongly correlated with the energy slope, and there is
   a linear increase in equivalent roughness height with increasing
   roughness concentration. The friction factor for an armored surface
   varies in a linear manner with representative roughness geometry. The
   equation defining this relation is probably similar to that used to
   characterize variations in the friction factor with artificial roughness
   geometry at low roughness concentrations. However, to reconcile the
   relations for artificial and natural roughness completely, it may be
   necessary to explicitly consider the contribution to flow resistance
   made by roughness shape, background roughness, and blocking in shallow
   flows.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrogeology and redox geochemistry of CH4 in two hydrogeological
   settings within a late Wisconsinan till and loess sequence in central
   Iowa were investigated using CH4, Eh, dissolved O2, NO3-N, NH4-N,
   dissolved Fe, SO4, H2S, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), particulate
   organic carbon (POC), deltaC-13-CH4, deltaH-2-CH4, deltaC-13 of
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and C-14-CH4. Depleted deltaC-13-CH4
   and deltaH-2-CH4 Values, enriched deltaC-13-DIC values, and the lack of
   higher hydrocarbons suggest that the CH4 is Microbial and is formed by
   CO2 reduction. Carbon 14 dates of CH4 indicate that 14,000- to
   17,000-year-old POC and DOC in the loess and till compose the substrate
   for methanogenesis. Production of CH4 probably began after deglaciation
   at about 12,000 years B.P. and has continued to the present. Groundwater
   recharge, particularly in the upland topographic position at the site,
   has decreased CH4 concentrations in the upper part of the till.}},

   THE NEW ALBANY SHALE OF THE ILLINOIS BASIN}},

Abstract = {{Much controversy centers on whether groundwater flow velocities in
   basin-scale circulation are large (tens of centimeters per year or more)
   or small (a few millimeters per year or less). Resolution of the
   controversy is particularly important in sedimentary basins in which
   salt beds are unknown but interstitial brines are pervasive. An example
   of one such basin is the Illinois Basin. The total dissolved solids
   (TDS) content of interstitial waters above the Upper Devonian New Albany
   Shale in the Illinois Basin increases with depth at an average rate of
   15 wt\% km 1. Mass transport calculations show that if no salt dissolved
   above the New Albany, upward diffusion alone should have lowered the
   salinity gradient over a 200 m.y. time span (i.e., since the
   Mid-Triassic) to between 10 and 30\% of the present value. The high
   salinity gradient found today requires either that halite dissolved
   slowly in rocks above the New Albany Shale over the past 200 m.y. or
   that the paleosalinity gradient, say, 200 m.y. B.P., was much greater
   than the value today. The flushing out of brines by meteoric water was
   simulated in a rectangular cross section of a generic basin 500 km wide
   and 1.5 km deep with a freshwater head gradient of 0.06\% across the
   top. Simulations were run using the computer code PORFLOW (Runchal,
   1987) which models coupled transport of fluid, heat, and dissolved salt.
   The simulations of brine flushing suggest that if topography-driven flow
   occurred for time spans of several million years, then the preservation
   of brines in rocks above the New Albany shale could only have been
   possible if macroscopic flow rates (flow rates averaged over large rock
   volumes) were very small, on the order of 10(-3) m yr-1 or less. When
   the horizontal permeability was 10(-13) m2 (10(-1) darcy) and the
   vertical permeability 10(-14) m2, brines that initially filled the basin
   were flushed out and replaced by fresh water in less than 5 m.y.,
   despite the fact that the initial concentration gradient assumed was
   almost twice the present day value. For such high permeabilities, even
   very high salt dissolution rates equivalent to the removal of 4.7 m of
   halite column per million years were insufficient to maintain high
   concentrations. When the permeabilities were lower, 10(-15) m2 along the
   horizontal and 10(-16) m2 along the vertical, high dissolved salt
   concentrations were maintained for longer times. Even so, about half of
   the dissolved salt initially in the pore waters was removed after 50
   m.y.}},

Abstract = {{Annual natural discharge (Q) of the River Murray and its most extensive
   tributary, the Darling River system, is often inversely related to sea
   surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific
   Ocean. These SST variations are components of a planetary-scale
   phenomenon referred to as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Darling
   and Murray river historical values of Q indicate that annual surface
   runoff from regions dominated by subtropical summer monsoon
   precipitation and annual surface runoff primarily responding to
   temperate winter storms are both strongly influenced by ENSO cycles.
   Forecasting, approximately 1 year in advance, of ENSO-related SST from
   geophysical model calculations thus provides a mechanism for estimating
   probabilities of annual river discharge amount. Contingency tables
   relating annual Q to SST, based on combining observed data for 95 years
   and forecast SST over a period of 15 years, provide probabilities of
   expected annual Q as a function of forecast SST. The SST of the eastern
   tropical Pacific was successfully forecast to be appreciably warmer than
   long-term mean conditions for much of the year beginning in mid 1991.
   Precipitation data through 1991 indicated that annual natural Q for the
   Darling River was probably substantially below the mean. However, winter
   precipitation in higher-runoff portions of the Murray Basin was above
   average during this El Nino episode, contrary to the trend for most such
   events over the past century.}},

Abstract = {{The evaporative fraction is a ratio of latent heat flux to the sum of
   latent and sensible heat fluxes. It has been used to characterize the
   energy partition over land surfaces and has potential for inferring
   daily energy balance information based on midday remote sensing
   measurements. The HAPEX-MOBILHY program SAMER system provided surface
   energy balance data over a range of agricultural crops and soil types.
   Data from this large-scale field experiment was analyzed to study the
   behavior and daylight stability of the evaporative fraction in both
   ideal and general meteorological conditions. Strong linear relations
   were found to exist between the midday evaporative fraction and the
   daylight evaporative fraction. Statistical tests, however, rejected the
   hypothesis that the two quantities were equal. Relations between the
   evaporative fraction and surface soil moisture as well as soil moisture
   over the complete root zone were explored, but no correlation was
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{Installation of surface levees and subsurface slurry walls around a
   1600-m by 950-m hazardous waste landfill in southeastern Louisiana has
   inadvertently converted the site into a large-scale permeameter.
   Differences in water levels in wells screened above and below a
   15-m-thick clay `'confining layer'' define a vertical hydraulic gradient
   of +0.1. Basic climatological data permit calculation of a complete
   water budget for the site, including vertical recharge q(z) down through
   the clay. Cumulative precipitation over a 44-month period was 5.5 m, and
   recharge was over 1.0 m. The calculated vertical hydraulic conductivity
   of the clay sequence is approximately 10(-5) cm s-1, up to 4 orders of
   magnitude higher than laboratory values for the same sediment.
   Intercalated sands and zones of pedogenic secondary porosity and
   fracturing developed during periods of subaerial weathering are
   apparently the dominant controls on vertical permeability, not the
   matrix properties of the clay.}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase (air-water) flow experiments were conducted in horizontal
   artificial fractures. The fractures were between glass plates that were
   either smooth or artificially roughened by gluing a layer of glass beads
   to them. One smooth fracture with an aperture of 1 mm and three rough
   fractures, one with the two surfaces in contact and two without contact,
   were studied. For both types of fractures, the flow structures are
   similar to those observed in two-phase flow in a pipe, with structures
   (bubbles, fingering bubbles, films, and drops) depending on the gas and
   liquid flow rates. The pressure gradients measured for different liquid
   and gas velocities were interpreted by three models. First, using
   Darcy's law leads to relative permeability curves similar to
   conventional ones for porous media. However, these curves depend not
   only on saturation but also on flow rates. This effect is caused by
   inertial forces which are not included in this approach. Second, the
   standard approach for two-phase flow in pipes (Lockhart and Martinelli's
   equation) agrees with experimental results, at least for small pressure
   gradients. Finally, the best fit was obtained by treating the two phases
   as one homogeneous phase. All the properties are averaged, and the
   pressure drop is deduced from an empirical correlation between the

Abstract = {{A series of chemical transport simulations in saturated porous media are
   conducted to examine the coupled impacts on chemical mobility induced by
   nonuniform sorption reactions and heterogeneous flow fields. The
   simulations involve the calculation of fluid flow and chemical migration
   within highly resolved, three-dimensional cubic regions with
   synthetically derived material properties. Nonuniformities in subsurface
   materials are represented as randomly correlated hydraulic conductivity
   and sorption partition coefficient fields. Transport computations are
   based upon a random walk particle model, appropriately modified to treat
   equilibrium sorption reactions. Current experiments focus on four
   hypothetical constituents, one being inert, and the other three
   independently obeying linear, Freundlich, and Langmuir partitioning
   relationships. Results show distinct effects of the nonuniform flow and
   sorption processes on the overall displacement, dispersion, and
   partitioning/retardation and the breakthrough behavior of the
   constituent plumes, as well as on the sharpening fronts and skewed
   concentration profiles associated with nonlinear partitioning models.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical compositional simulator (Multiphase Multicomponent
   Nonisothermal Organics Transport Simulator (M2NOTS)) has been developed
   for modeling transient, three-dimensional, nonisothermal, and multiphase
   transport of multicomponent organic contaminants in the subsurface. The
   governing equations include (1) advection of all three phases in
   response to pressure, capillary, and gravity forces; (2) interphase mass
   transfer that allows every component to partition into each phase
   present; (3) diffusion; and (4) transport of sensible and latent heat
   energy. Two other features distinguish M2 NOTS from other simulators
   reported in the groundwater literature: (1) the simulator allows for any
   number of chemical components and every component is allowed to
   partition into all fluid phases present, and (2) each phase is allowed
   to completely disappear from, or appear in, any region of the domain
   during a simulation. These features are required to model realistic
   field problems involving transport of mixtures of nonaqueous phase
   liquid contaminants, and to quantify performance of existing and
   emerging remediation methods such as vacuum extraction and steam
   injection.}},

Abstract = {{Water temperature records at the outlet of a fractured carbonate system
   during an annual cycle show two types of variation, slow variations over
   a small range, resulting from the thermal equilibrium between water and
   rock in the aquifer, and more rapid variations over a wider range,
   transmitted more quickly due to the inflow of water through fractures or
   karstic pipes. Starting at the outlet we present first a model of
   thermal exchange for flow in a conduit, then a model of thermal exchange
   in a porous medium between the surface and the reservoir. The comparison
   with the data recorded at Guichy (Nievre, France) allows us to establish
   the fact that on this site the vertical flow between the surface and the
   reservoir is rapid through a fracture network as is the case for the
   flow at the outlet.}},

   tension head is given in the form K(PSI) = A(B + PSI(n))-1. The solution
   expresses the depth from the water table as a function of the capillary
   tension for a given rate of percolation or capillary rise. It is easily
   inverted to obtain explicit expressions both for the capillary tension
   as a function of depth and flow rate, and for the steady flow rate in
   terms of the capillary tension at a given depth. The latter is shown to
   compare favorably both to existing limiting case solutions of
   percolation to a water table at infinite depth, and to capillary rise
   from a shallow water table to an infinitely dry surface. More
   importantly, this solution applies to the intermediate condition where
   the magnitude and direction of flow are sensitive to both the
   near-surface capillary tension and the water table depth.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of soil water during rainfall events and the subsequent
   depletion of soil water by evaporation between storms can be described,
   to first order, by simple accounting models. When the alternating
   supplies (precipitation) and demands (potential evaporation) are viewed
   as random variables, it follows that soil-water storage, evaporation,
   and runoff are also random variables. If the forcing (supply and demand)
   processes are stationary for a sufficiently long period of time, an
   asymptotic regime should eventually be reached where the probability
   distribution functions of storage, evaporation, and runoff are
   stationary and uniquely determined by the distribution functions of the
   forcing. Under the assumptions that the potential evaporation rate is
   constant, storm arrivals are Poisson-distributed, rainfall is
   instantaneous, and storm depth follows an exponential distribution, it
   is possible to derive the asymptotic distributions of storage,
   evaporation, and runoff analytically for a simple balance model. A
   particular result is that the fraction of rainfall converted to runoff
   is given by (1 - R-1)/(e(alpha(1-R-1)) - R-1), in which R is the ratio
   of mean potential evaporation to mean rainfall and alpha is the ratio of
   soil water-holding capacity to mean storm depth. The problem considered
   here is analogous to the well-known problem of storage in a reservoir
   behind a dam, for which the present work offers a new solution for
   reservoirs of finite capacity. A simple application of the results of
   this analysis suggests that random, intraseasonal fluctuations of
   precipitation cannot by themselves explain the observed dependence of
   the annual water balance on annual totals of precipitation and potential
   evaporation.}},

Abstract = {{The need for a realistic and rational method for interpolating sparse
   data sets is widespread. Real porosity and hydraulic conductivity data
   do not vary smoothly over space, so an interpolation scheme that
   preserves irregularity is desirable. Such a scheme based on the
   properties of fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and fractional Gaussian
   noise (fGn) is presented. Following the methodology of Hewett (1986),
   the authors test for the presence of fGn in a set of 459 hydraulic
   conductivity (K) measurements. The use of rescaled-range analysis
   strongly indicated the presence of fGn when applied to the natural logs
   of the K data, and the resulting Hurst coefficient (H) was determined to
   be 0.82. This H value was then used along with the methodology of
   successive random additions to generate a fBm K interpolation
   (realization) in the vertical cross section between two wells. The
   results appeared realistic, and the overall methodology presented herein
   may serve as an improved basis for a conditional simulation approach to
   the study of various transport processes in porous media. It is now
   known that fGn- and fBm-related processes are among the most common
   spatial and temporal variations found in nature, although a common
   physical origin, if any, remains obscure,}},

Abstract = {{One of the characteristics of flow and transport in fractured rock is
   that the flow may be largely confined to a poorly connected network of
   fractures. In order to represent this condition, Lawrence Berkeley
   Laboratory has been developing a new type of fracture hydrology model
   called an `'equivalent discontinuum'' model. In this model we represent
   the discontinuous nature of the problem through flow on a partially
   filled lattice. This is done through a statistical inverse technique
   called `'simulated annealing.'' The fracture network model is
   `'annealed'' by continually modifying a base model, or `'template,'' so
   that with each modification, the model behaves more and more like the
   observed system. This template is constructed using geological and
   geophysical data to identify the regions that possibly conduct fluid and
   the probable orientations of channels that conduct fluid. In order to
   see how the simulated annealing algorithm works, we have developed a
   synthetic case. In this case, the geometry of the fracture network is
   completely known, so that the results of annealing to steady state data
   can be evaluated absolutely. We also analyze field data from the
   Migration Experiment at the Grimsel Rock Laboratory in Switzerland.}},

   Management District (SJRWMD) in Florida. The algorithm processes
   historic and currently available head measurements to make optimal
   predictions of future head levels over a grid of 554 wells spanning the
   SJRWMD. Measurements are obtained monthly from a subset of 20 wells and
   semiannually from the remaining wells. The Kalman filter incorporates an
   empirical spatiotemporal model of regional groundwater fluctuations
   derived from long-term historical data records at the 20 monthly
   measured wells. The algorithm (1) extrapolates the measurements provided
   by the 20 monthly measured wells to estimate monthly head levels at all
   554 wells in the grid and (2) predicts future head levels at each well
   in the absence of measurements. The performance of the Kalman filtering
   algorithm is assessed by examining its ability to forecast piezometric
   head behavior at the 534 well locations where historic data were not
   used to estimate either the system model or the spatiotemporal
   correlation structure of the model residuals.}},

Abstract = {{Reservoir operation decisions require constant reevaluation in the face
   of conflicting objectives, varying hydrologic conditions. and frequent
   operational policy changes. Optimality is a relative concept very much
   dependent on the circumstances under which a decision is made. More than
   anything else, reservoir management authorities need the means to assess
   the impacts of various operational options. It is their responsibility
   to define what is desirable after a thorough evaluation of the existing
   circumstances. This article presents a model designed to generate
   operational trade-offs common among reservoir systems. The model avoids
   an all-encompassing problem formulation and distinguishes three
   operational modes (levels) corresponding to normal, drought, and flood
   operations. Each level addresses only relevant system elements and uses
   a static and a dynamic control module to optimize turbine performance
   within each planning period and temporally. The model is used for
   planning the operation of the Savannah River System.}},

Abstract = {{We present a statistical model relating measurements of water quality to
   associated errors in laboratory methods. Estimation of the model allows
   us to correct trends in water quality for long-term and short-term
   variations in laboratory measurement errors. An illustration of the bias
   correction method for a large national set of stream water quality and
   quality assurance data shows that reductions in the bias of estimates of
   water quality trend slopes are achieved at the expense of increases in
   the variance of these estimates. Slight improvements occur in the
   precision of estimates of trend in bias by using correlative information
   on bias and water quality to estimate random variations in measurement
   bias. The results of this investigation stress the need for reliable,
   long-term quality assurance data and efficient statistical methods to
   assess the effects of measurement errors on the detection of water
   quality trends.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic model is described that allows transfer of information from
   general circulation models to precipitation gauge locations using a
   weather state classification scheme. The weather states, which are based
   on present and previous day's sea level pressure, are related
   stochastically to gauge daily precipitation and temperature. Weather
   states are defined to give maximal separation of test station
   precipitation distributions using the Classification and Regression
   Trees procedure. Precipitation amounts are resampled from historical
   observations, conditional on the weather state and the previous day's
   rain state. Daily temperature maxima and minima are simulated by
   conditioning on the present and previous day's rain state, with the
   residual modeled as a first-order autoregressive process. The model
   parameters are estimated using 9 years (1965-1973) of concurrent U.S.
   National Meteorological Center (NMC) gridded observations and four
   precipitation stations in the Columbia River Basin. The model is
   illustrated using both historical NMC gridded observations of sea level
   pressure and lower atmosphere temperature, as well as the same variables
   from the General Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model for
   present climate and CO2 doubling. A 40-year sequence of simulated
   precipitation and temperature is used to estimate seasonal streamflows
   and flood frequency distributions under present and doubled CO2
   climates.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes laboratory and field experiments which were
   conducted to study the dynamics of trichloroethylene (TCE) as it
   volatilized from contaminated groundwater and diffused in the presence
   of infiltrating water through the unsaturated soil zone to the land
   surface. The field experiments were conducted at the Picatinny Arsenal,
   which is part of the United States Geological Survey Toxic Substances
   Hydrology Program. In both laboratory and field settings the gas and
   water phase concentrations of TCE were not in equilibrium during
   infiltration. Gas-water mass transfer rate constants were calibrated to
   the experimental data using a model in which the water phase was treated
   as two phases: a mobile water phase and an immobile water phase. The
   mass transfer limitations of a volatile organic compound between the gas
   and liquid phases were described explicitly in the model. In the
   laboratory experiment the porous medium was nonsorbing, and water
   infiltration rates ranged from 0.076 to 0.28 cm h-1. In the field
   experiment the water infiltration rate was 0.34 cm h-1, and sorption
   onto the soil matrix was significant. The laboratory-calibrated
   gas-water mass transfer rate constant is 3.3 x 10(-4) h-1 for an
   infiltration rate of 0.076 cm h-1 and 1.4 x 10(-3) h-1 for an
   infiltration rate of 0.28 cm h-1. The overall mass transfer rate
   coefficients, incorporating the contribution of mass transfer between
   mobile and immobile water phases and the variation of interfacial area
   with moisture content, range from 3 x 10(-4) h-1 to 1 x 10(-2) h-1. A
   power law model relates the gas-water mass transfer rate constant to the
   infiltration rate and the fraction of the water phase which is mobile.
   It was found that the results from the laboratory experiments could not
   be extrapolated to the field. In order to simulate the field experiment
   the very slow desorption of TCE from the soil matrix was incorporated
   into the mathematical model. When desorption from the soil matrix was
   added to the model, the calibrated gas-water mass transfer rate constant
   is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that predicted using the power law
   model developed for the nonsorbing laboratory soil.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetically controlled volatilization and dissolution of nonaqueous
   phase liquids (NAPLs) may play an important role in the transport of
   volatile compounds in the unsaturated (vadose) zone. In this study, some
   one- and two-dimensional steady state transport problems are solved
   analytically. The one-dimensional case is pertinent to pollution by a
   relatively long, mainly horizontally spread leak of NAPL. The
   two-dimensional case corresponds to situations in which the pollution
   spreads primarily vertically, originating at the ground surface and
   migrating to the top of the capillary fringe, and in which the solution
   domain may be represented by a cross-sectional model. Solutions of the
   steady state transport problems are used to investigate effects of
   several parameters, characterizing the advective-dispersive and purely
   diffusive transport regimes, on the NAPL concentration distribution for
   the one- and two-dimensional cases, respectively. Results of this
   analysis indicate that the mass exchange between NAPL and other phases
   may not reach equilibrium, even for relatively large mass transfer rate
   coefficients and small water infiltration rates, if this zone has
   relatively small vertical or horizontal extent and is located close to
   the fully open ground surface. Analysis of local volatilization and
   dissolution fluxes shows that, under equilibrium conditions, the main
   losses of the organic phase take place at the upper part of the NAPL
   zone.}},

Abstract = {{Many researchers have used freezing as an effective, short-term, water
   sample preservation method for subsequent nutrient analysis. In this
   study, filtered samples held at -16 +/- 2-degrees-C for 4-8 years were

   Orthophosphate and ammonia concentrations decreased by 0.2 mug P/L and 5
   mug N/L, respectively, at mean concentrations of 69.4 mug P/L and 246
   mug N/L. Nitrate plus nitrite increased by 1.1 mug N/L at a mean
   concentration of 139.1 mug N/L. An anaerobic well sample proved to be
   unsuitable for freezing because it lost significant amounts of
   orthophosphate during the freezing process. None of the differences
   observed over long periods of frozen storage were more than twice the
   estimated standard deviation of the analytical methods used in the
   study. The small changes observed demonstrate the effectiveness of
   frozen storage as a means of nutrient preservation in water samples that

Abstract = {{This study has two objectives: (1) to compare the attitudes of the
   water-using public, water officials, and elected officials toward the
   risk of water supply shortage; and (2) to develop a methodology for
   incorporating water users' valuation of reliability in system design.
   Using contingent valuation techniques, we have measured the benefits and
   costs of different reliability levels in terms of water users'
   willingness to pay (WTP) for increases in reliability and in terms of
   their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation in the form of lower
   water bills for lower levels of reliability. Three cities in northern
   Colorado with diverse baseline levels of water supply reliability
   (Aurora, Boulder, and Longmont) are the study sites. Contrary to our
   hypothesis that water managers are unjustifiably risk averse, we find
   that water managers' preferences are consistent with customer WTP (WTA)
   values associated with the risk of water shortages and the system costs
   associated with reliability. Water managers in Boulder (high
   reliability) were willing to consider reductions in the level of system
   reliability while water managers in Aurora and Longmont (low
   reliability) favored the status quo or increased reliability. While
   these attitudes were sometimes contrary to a majority of customers'
   expressed interests in change, they were shown to be justified by
   comparison of supply system costs (savings) with aggregate WTP for
   additional reliability (WTA for less reliability).}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater quantity management problems with fixed charges have been
   formulated in the past as mixed integer and linear programming problems.
   In this paper a new methodology is presented where the fixed charges are
   incorporated into the objective function in an exponential form and the
   problem is solved as a concave minimization problem. The principal
   difficulty in the minimization of a concave function over a linear or
   nonlinear set of constraints is that the local minima which are
   determined by the classical minimization algorithms may not be global.
   In an effort to circumvent this problem the outer approximation method
   is introduced. This method is applicable to the global minimization of a
   concave function over a compact set of constraints. In the present work
   the outer approximation is applied to concave minimization problems over
   a convex compact set of constraints. Two applications of the method to
   groundwater management problems are presented herein, and the results
   are compared with an existing solution obtained using a different
   optimization approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the outline of an approximate mathematical
   technique capable of including stochastic components in environmental
   models based on ordinary differential equations. The technique is based
   on the decomposition of the solution into additive components, with the
   first component being the solution of a simplified deterministic
   equation and each of the other components being found in terms of those
   preceding it. Moments of the solution process can then be calculated by
   performing appropriate averaging. The method provides natural
   statistical separability, that is, no truncations in the derivation
   stage or closure approximations are necessary. The random quantities
   involved can be either random variables or stochastic processes. No
   unrealistic assumptions, like white noise behavior or small randomness,
   are necessary. Solutions, which are in the form of infinite but
   convergent series, can be easily implemented into computer programs,
   providing convenient support in management and decision analysis. A
   demonstration application of a simple biochemical oxygen demand model
   for river waters illustrates the usefulness of the technique in
   environmental modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Important features of multiphase flow in porous media that distinguish
   it from single-phase flow are the presence of interfaces between the
   fluid phases and of common lines where three phases come in contact.
   Despite this fact, mathematical descriptions of these flows have been
   lacking in rigor, consisting primarily of heuristic extensions of
   Darcy's law that include a hysteretic relation between capillary
   pressure and saturation and a relative permeability coefficient. As a
   result, the standard capillary pressure concept appears to have
   physically unrealistic properties. The present paper employs microscopic
   mass and momentum balance equations for phases and interfaces to develop
   an understanding of capillary pressure at the microscale. Next, the
   standard theories and approaches that define capillary pressure at the
   macroscale are described and their shortcomings are discussed. Finally,
   an approach is presented whereby capillary pressure is shown to be an
   intrinsic property of the system under study. In particular, the
   presence of interfaces and their distribution within a multiphase system
   are shown to be essential to describing the state of the system. A
   thermodynamic approach to the definition of capillary pressure provides
   a theoretically sound alternative to the definition of capillary
   pressure as a simple hysteretic function of saturation.}},

Abstract = {{In situ sensing technology, used in a series of natural-gradient tracer
   tests at the Chalk River Laboratories in Ontario, leads to the
   introduction of a conceptually new approach to the study of groundwater
   motion in porous media. As opposed to the conventional approach, based
   on the consideration of a fictitious fluid continuum with fluid
   properties distributed over both voids and solids, in the new approach
   the actual groundwater motion in the void space of a porous medium is
   considered and described at the local scale by the statistical
   characterization of the propagation of gamma-radiation energy associated
   with the moving water as a tracer. The essential feature of the new
   approach is that the mean free path of a gamma-energy photon instead of
   the porosity is used as a scaling factor in transferring information
   associated with pore-scale fluid motion to the local scale. This scaling
   factor is employed for reintroducing the familiar particle model of
   fluid motion but at the local scale. It is shown that when the
   local-scale dispersion is neglected, the evolution of local-scale fluid
   particles making up the tracer plume can be described by the advection
   equation; its equation of characteristics describes trajectories of
   local-scale particles. A simple analytical solution to the advection
   equation is then used to produce three-dimensional images of the spatial
   distribution of local-scale particles observed in the Twin Lake test. It
   is also shown that the spatial averaging procedure with regard to the
   weighting function for a spherical averaging volume of one mean free
   path radius may be used to introduce the three-dimensional field of
   local-scale concentration. The averaging procedure is then used to
   illustrate that the concept of the three-dimensional field of
   plume-scale concentration does not make physical sense and only the
   one-dimensional plume-scale concentration field may be introduced in
   shallow aquifers.}},

   of spatial variability in the concentration field generated in a
   natural-gradient tracer test with a high-energy gamma-emitting
   radiotracer. In situ sensing technology is used for mapping the
   concentration distribution, and collected concentration-versus-depth
   profiles are correlated to produce the local-scale geometric model of
   aquifer heterogeneities for further numerical groundwater flow and mass
   transport modeling. In the second parametric approach, heterogeneity is
   characterized in terms of spatial variability of the groundwater
   velocity rather than in terms of spatial variability of the hydraulic
   conductivity. Geostatistics is used to characterize the local-scale
   velocity variation in terms of velocity integral scales in three
   orthogonal directions, in the longitudinal (along the mean flow) and two
   transverse (across the flow) directions. The velocity correlation volume
   is estimated as 16.68 x 2 x 0.22 m. It defines the characteristic volume
   for the `'field-scale'' groundwater flow and mass transport modeling. It
   was concluded that the field mapping of aquifer structure by measuring
   concentrations and travel times of a radiotracer leads to a
   fundamentally new approach to the characterization of geologic
   heterogeneity and offers a reliable means for solving this complex
   problem of contemporary hydrogeology in quantitative terms.}},

Abstract = {{The primary objectives of the Twin Lake experiments have been to study
   geologic heterogencities and field-scale dispersion and to provide data
   for developing and evaluating groundwater flow and transport models. The
   experiment reported here was undertaken in 1987-1988 to expand the
   studies of heterogeneity and dispersion from a 40-m scale investigated
   in 1983 to a full 270-m scale from the point of tracer injection to the
   groundwater discharge zone. The hydrogeologic setting, the experimental
   and analytical methods, and the interpretation of experimental data are
   the topics of discussion in this paper. The 1983 and 1987-1988 tracer
   tests were used to evaluate the predictive abilities of various
   numerical groundwater flow and transport models. The modeling is done
   along the mean flow direction in the vertical plane. The two-dimensional
   finite-element modeling was successful in simulating the hydraulic head
   distribution but not the groundwater motion or the tracer transport. In
   addition, owing to the advection-dominated nature of the groundwater
   flow, the transport simulation suffered from numerical dispersion.
   Significant improvements in simulations were obtained using
   method-of-characteristics- and random-walk-based computer models. The
   influence of dimensionality on the transport simulation was evaluated by
   comparing the two- and three-dimensional random-walk simulations. It was
   found that over the first 40 m along the mean flow path, the
   three-dimensional simulation does not reproduce the plume migration any
   better than the two-dimensional simulation does. Random-walk simulations
   of the transport observed in the 1983 and 1987-1988 tests are also done
   on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and tracer
   test-derived velocities without invoking the concept of hydraulic
   conductivity and Darcy's law. These simulations were found to be
   superior to simulations based on the coupled flow and transport models.
   It was also found that the simulated hydraulic head distribution is
   insensitive to spatial variations in hydraulic conductivity and the
   simulated groundwater velocity distribution is inappropriate for
   transport modeling. It was concluded that the advection-dispersion
   models of the local-scale transport perform better in predicting the
   tracer migration at the Twin Lake aquifer using measured velocities
   rather than velocities simulated by a flow model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a dynamic two-dimensional two-phase flow model for a
   single variable aperture fracture is developed. The model is based on a
   finite volume implementation of the cubic law and the conservation of
   mass for each liquid. The two-phase fracture flow system is represented
   by incompressible parallel plate flow within two-dimensional subregions
   of constant aperture. The fluid phase distribution is represented by an
   explicit definition of the phase presence at each location within the
   domain. To achieve this definition, a phase distribution is assigned to
   each fracture subregion. Knowledge of the phase distribution allows
   calculation of interface capillary pressure based on the fracture
   aperture. One-dimensional analytic solutions for two-phase flow are
   developed and used to verify the model's behavior in one dimension. The
   model is verified against the Sandia Waste-Isolation Flow and Transport
   III model for the case of two-dimensional single-phase flow.
   Two-dimensional two-phase flow verification is performed qualitatively
   because no suitable analytic or physical model is currently available.
   Two-dimensional flow phenomena are investigated for variable aperture
   fractures generated using geostatistical methods. Results from these
   simulations illustrate the flow processes of phase isolation, pinching
   off of nonwetting phase globules, nonwetting phase refusal at the edges
   of tight regions, and downslope migration of a fluid countercurrent to
   flow of a less dense fluid.}},

Abstract = {{Several authors have recently expressed interest in chemical transport
   within fractured media. The majority of these efforts have been based on
   a linear relationship between the dispersion coefficient and the average
   fluid velocity within the fracture. It is not apparent that this
   relationship is fully justified in all applications. For the present
   study, it is assumed (as suggested by authors working in porous media)
   that the dispersion coefficient is proportional to the velocity raised
   to a power, n. Further, it is assumed that transport within the fracture
   follows classic advection-dispersion behavior (e.g., Fickian
   dispersion). The present study focuses on the value of the power n in a
   series of artificial fractures. In particular, an experimental apparatus
   is utilized to run controlled tracer experiments through a single
   fracture. When the fracture consists of smooth parallel plates, the
   results from the experiments indicate that the dispersion coefficient is
   proportional to the velocity squared (consistent with the early work by
   Taylor (1953) for transport dominated by transverse diffusion). As the
   fracture roughness is increased through use of blockages within the
   fracture and/or addition of surface roughness along the fracture walls,
   the relationship between dispersion and velocity varied. For each
   fracture roughness, the results followed the general relationship in
   which dispersion is proportional to velocity raised to the power n. The
   power n, however, was strongly dependent on the fracture roughness,
   taking on a value of 2.0 for smooth parallel plates and decreasing to a
   value of approximately 1.3 for rough plates.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that inaccuracies exist in the numerical
   solutions of the Richards equation. A need exists to examine such
   inaccuracies and to correlate them, formally, to the soil hydraulic
   properties and the size of the spatial and temporal mesh. In the absence
   of criteria for mesh design, mass conservation and the rate of
   convergence are usually used as bases for acceptance of the solution. It
   is well documented, however, that neither can guarantee an accurate
   solution. This paper proposes the Courant and Peclet numbers as criteria
   for estimating spatial and temporal increments. The study defines upper
   limits of these numbers for acceptable accuracy of the numerical
   solutions. For cases that are characterized by decreasing pressure head
   gradients, although the initial size of the time step may be extremely
   small, efficient solutions are possible through a careful choice of an
   expansion factor for such a step.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow in hydrocarbon reservoirs and groundwater aquifers is
   traditionally studied by assuming that the formation permeability is
   constant. Such an assumption can, however, result in significant errors
   in the estimation of temporal and spatial variation of pressure when the
   formation permeability is pressure sensitive. In the present study a
   simple technique is proposed to obtain approximate analytical solutions
   to the diffusive problem with pressure-dependent formation permeability.
   A constant pressure test in an infinitely large system is considered.
   Solutions to the flow problem in linear, cylindrical, and spherical
   systems are derived. These solutions are then compared with the
   corresponding constant permeability solutions and are related to a
   dimensionless parameter alpha(D) which is a measure of the pressure
   sensitivity of the formation permeability. In the present analysis the
   parameter alpha(D) is used to define a simple relationship between the
   pressure-sensitive and constant permeability solutions for all three
   geometries. It is shown that the constant permeability solutions may
   underestimate the pressure distribution by approximately 10\% or more
   for a spherical system for alpha(D) = 0.2. Moreover, it is demonstrated
   that the pressure difference between the two solutions would be most
   significant within a distance of a few well bore radii around the well
   bore and at large times. For a cylindrical system the maximum pressure
   difference is located at the well bore and is approximately 10\% for
   alpha(D) = 0.2.}},

Abstract = {{Well water quality depends on the relative amounts of water drawn from
   the pumped aquifer and nearby surface water bodies, such as streams,
   lakes, and wetlands. Although a surface water body may normally gain
   water from the aquifer, pumping can reverse gradients, causing it to
   lose water near the well. Surface water then enters the well by induced
   infiltration. Two-dimensional vertically integrated models of induced
   infiltration are developed for various combinations of aquifer geometry
   and sources of recharge. The models, which have applications in wellhead
   protection. aquifer pollution characterization, and aquifer remediation,
   are presented graphically. They show that the propensity for and rate of
   induced infiltration are enhanced by higher pumping rates, proximity of
   the well to the stream, and the presence of nearby barrier boundaries.
   The propensity and rate are reduced by the presence of other surface
   water bodies. Ambient groundwater discharge rate to the surface water
   body also plays a role, but not its source, whether it is from local
   vertical recharge, lateral inflow, or both. The results are also largely
   indifferent to whether the aquifer transmissivity is assumed to be a
   constant, or a function of water table elevation. Finally, if the well
   is close enough to the surface water body, say, less than 5\% of the
   aquifer width, then the aquifer acts as if it were semi-infinite.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) univariate
   models and single input-single output transfer function (SARIMA with
   externalities or SARIMAX) models of groundwater head fluctuations are
   developed for 21 Upper Floridan aquifer observation wells in northeast
   Florida. These models incorporate empirical relationships between
   rainfall input and head response based on historical correlations and
   cross correlations between these two time series. The magnitude of the
   forecast error terms indicates that the SARIMA and SARIMAX models
   explain an average of 84-87\% of the variation observed in the monthly
   piezometric head levels for 1-month lead forecasts. Thus the models
   account for the dominant processes which affect temporal groundwater
   fluctuations. Both the SARIMA and SARIMAX models provide unbiased
   forecasts of piezometric head levels; however, the SARIMAX models
   produce more accurate forecasts (i.e., smaller forecast probability
   limits) than the SARIMA models, particularly as lead time increases.
   Modeling efforts reveal consistent model structures over the study
   region, with local hydrologic and geologic conditions causing
   site-specific variability in the time series model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of flow quantiles is a major focus of current hydrologic
   research. Probabilistic representations of a few individual quantiles,
   notably the annual flood and low flow, have been devised, and recently a
   few of the larger quantiles have been modeled. This research describes
   and demonstrates the use of a probability model for all flow quantiles
   in a river. A flow duration curve represents the annual flow frequency
   characteristics of rivers by depicting the cumulative frequencies for
   average ranked flows in a river. A model requiring only five parameters
   is developed, by combining the principles of order statistics and
   traditional flow frequency analyses, and applied to flow duration curves
   for rivers in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Streamflows in
   British Columbia are generated from a number of distinct physical
   processes operating in highly variable environments. The model presented
   incorporates the physical generating processes of streamflow in both the
   statistical representation of flow duration curves and their
   interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of 8 three-parameter probability distributions for
   representing annual extreme and partial duration precipitation data at
   stations in the northeastern and southeastern United States is
   investigated. Particular attention is paid to fidelity on the right
   tail, through use of a bootstrap procedure simulating extrapolation on
   the right tail beyond the data. It is found that the beta-kappa
   distribution best describes the extreme right tail of annual extreme
   series, and the beta-P distribution is best for the partial duration
   data. The conventionally employed two-parameter Gumbel distribution is
   found to substantially underestimate probabilities associated with the
   larger precipitation amounts for both annual extreme and partial
   duration data. Fitting the distributions using left-censored data did
   not result in improved fits to the right tail.}},

Abstract = {{This work reports on the practical usage of the four stochastic
   rainfall-runoff models introduced by Bierkens and Puente (1990). These
   models, which are lumped in space, were analytically derived combining
   two rainfall point process models with two simple runoff
   parameterizations. The rainfall models employ rectangular pulses with
   Poisson (PRP) and Neyman-Scott (NSRP) arrivals, respectively. The runoff
   models route individual rainfall pulses via linear reservoirs. One
   runoff parameterization accounts for surface runoff by using a single
   linear reservoir (SLR). The other model considers both surface and
   groundwater runoff employing two linear reservoirs in parallel (PLR).
   All four representations were tested on two catchments located in the
   Netherlands and Colombia. Emphasis was placed on the models' ability to
   (1) give stable parameter values for data sets at alternative averaging
   (aggregation) lengths (consistency) and (2) preserve historical
   statistics at alternative averaging lengths when using parameters found
   from data at other averaging scales (robustness). Results show that the
   use of alternative rainfall models may have little effect on runoff
   performance. Specifically, the NSRP model resulted in more robust runoff
   behavior than the PRP model only when combined to the SLR
   parameterization. The type of model used to route individual rainfall
   pulses was found to be important. Runoff representations containing the
   PLR component were found more robust than those having the SLR model.}},

   Based upon the application of this method to the Dniester and Pruth
   rivers we established the self-similarity of the river pattern on small
   scales and the self-affinity on large scales. For these rivers we
   obtained the fractal scaling exponents, the characteristic scales, and
   the anisotropy parameters. A computer model has been developed which
   simulates river patterns whose fractal properties are close to the
   properties of natural objects. A generalized model of fractal behavior
   of natural rivers is proposed. On the basis of self-affinity of natural
   and simulated rivers on large scales, a hypothesis has been formulated
   which explains the violation of the dimension principle in the
   well-known relation between the river length and the catchment area,}},

Abstract = {{The hierarchical ordinal and statistical models of river networks are
   proposed. Their investigation has been carried out on the basis of river
   networks computer simulation as well as on empirical data analysis. The
   simulated river networks display self-similar behavior on small scales
   (the fractal dimension D almost-equal-to 1.52 and Hurst's exponent H =
   1.0) and self-affine behavior on large scales (the lacunary dimension
   D(G) almost-equal-to 1.71, H almost-equal-to 0. 58). Similar behavior is
   also qualitatively characteristic for natural river networks (for
   catchment areas from 142 to 63,700 km2 we obtained D(G) almost-equal-to
   1.87 and H almost-equal-to 0.73). Thus in both cases one finds a region
   of scales with self-affine behavior (H < 1) and with D(G) < 2.
   Proceeding from fractal properties of the river networks, the
   theoretical basis of scaling relationships L approximately A(beta) and L
   approximately A(epsilon), widely used in hydrology, are given (L, L, and
   A denote the main river length, the total length of the river network,
   and catchment area, respectively); beta = 1/(1 + H) and epsilon =
   D(G)/2.}},

Abstract = {{A recurring problem in watershed hydrology is the identification of flow
   paths along which water is routed in both surface and subsurface
   environments. In particular, the question of whether storm flow is
   composed primarily of water flowing over the land surface (overland
   flow) or beneath the land surface (subsurface flow) is significant,
   because the former flow path provides for little soil contact, while the
   latter allows for extensive interaction with subsurface materials. The
   Reedy Creek watershed (45.1 km2) in the Virginia Coastal Plain has been
   the subject of field hydrogeological, hydrochemical, and hydrological
   studies since 1989. Results from chemical separation of six storm flow
   hydrographs indicate that saturation overland flow (including both
   direct precipitation onto and return flow to the surface) from saturated
   contributing areas is the dominant storm flow generation mechanism in
   the watershed; new water composed 11-38\% of creek discharge at the
   hydrograph peaks, and maximum 24-hour rainfall intensity explained 96\%
   of the total variation in the peak new water contribution among the six
   events. Estimates of new water-contributing areas determined from the
   chemical separations were found to vary as a function of antecedent
   conditions and were also found to be consistent with estimates of areas
   of likely surface saturation (e.g., perennial channels, open water, and
   riparian wetland areas) based on field observations and topographic
   maps.}},

Abstract = {{Tritium and He isotopes have been measured at a site where groundwater
   flow is nearly vertical for a travel time of 100 years and where
   recharge rates are spatially variable. Because the mid-1960s H-3 peak
   (arising from aboveground testing of thermonuclear devices) is
   well-defined, the vertical groundwater velocity is known with unusual
   accuracy at this site. Utilizing H-3 and its stable daughter He-3 to
   determine groundwater ages, we compute a recharge rate of 0.16 m/yr,
   which agrees to within about 5\% of the value based on the depth of the
   H-3 peak (measured both in 1986 and 1991) and two-dimensional modeling
   in an area of high recharge. Zero H-3/He-3 age occurs at a depth that is
   approximately equal to the average depth of the annual low water table,
   even though the capillary fringe extends to land surface during most of
   the year at the study site. In an area of low recharge (0.05 m/yr) where
   the H-3 peak (and hence the vertical velocity) is also well-defined, the
   H-3/He-3 results could not be used to compute recharge because samples
   were not collected sufficiently far above the 3H peak; however, modeling
   indicates that the H-3/He-3 age gradient near the water table is an
   accurate measure of vertical velocities in the low-recharge area.
   Because H-3 and He-3 have different diffusion coefficients, and because
   the amount of mechanical mixing is different in the area of high
   recharge than in the low-recharge area, we have separated the dispersive
   effects of mechanical mixing from molecular diffusion. We estimate a
   longitudinal dispersivity of 0.07 m and effective diffusion coefficients
   for H-3 ((HHO)-H-3)) and He-3 of 2.4 x 10(-5) and 1.3 x 10(-4) m/day,
   respectively. Although the 3H/3He age gradient is an excellent indicator
   of vertical groundwater velocities above the mid-1960s 3H peak,
   dispersive mixing and diffusive loss of He-3 perturb the age gradient
   near and below the H-3 peak.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental approach to study physical processes affecting fluid
   behavior in three-fluid porous media systems was designed and
   implemented. These experiments were designed to provide quantitative
   evidence of important pore-scale displacement processes. A unique
   experimental approach using a two-dimensional synthetic porous medium
   (micromodel) and digital image analysis (DIA) enabled both measurement
   of three-fluid capillary pressure-saturation relationships and analysis
   of fluid behavior at the pore level. Experiments were pressure
   controlled, and were designed to mimic measurements typically performed
   on laboratory cores. Only quasi-static measurements were made, with a
   focus on capillary pressure-saturation relations. Different orders of
   fluid infiltration with respect to wettability were studied. DIA made it
   possible to obtain quantitative information about the experiments,
   including fluid saturations, saturation changes between pressure steps,
   and movement of apparently isolated fluids through films. The results
   provide insights into important pore-scale mechanisms and provide a
   basis for three-fluid pore-scale computations.}},

Abstract = {{Previous theoretical discussion of flow and transport in a single
   fracture has led to a difference of opinion as to whether the aperture
   estimated from a tracer test need always be less than (or greater than)
   the aperture estimated from a concurrent hydraulic test. Interpretation
   of previously published field results has, to our knowledge, not
   provided a defensible example where the ratio of these two aperture
   estimates has varied from less than 1.0 to greater than 1.0 in the same
   fracture using the same analysis techniques. In the present paper, field
   experiments involving concurrent hydraulic and tracer tests have been
   run in two different directions within an isolated fracture. Aperture
   estimates were derived from both the hydraulic and tracer tests. The
   ratio of the aperture estimated from the tracer test to the aperture
   estimated from the hydraulic test is shown to be greater than 1.0 in the
   first experiment and less than 1.0 in the second experiment. Despite
   noise in the hydraulic test of the first experiment, it is argued that
   our interpretation is reasonable. As such, this represents the first set
   of experimental results known to us in which a defensible interpretation
   leads to the conclusion that the aperture ratio varies from greater than
   1.0 to less than 1.0 within the same fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Porous media are considered to be composed of spatial distributions of
   particles, which individually follow Langmuir sorption isotherms (with
   their own distinct, randomly sampled sorption capacities and selectivity
   coefficients). Analyses of batch and column methods for determining the
   sorptive parameters of these porous media reveal that batch-derived
   estimates of retardation based upon Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms
   systematically underestimate and overestimate that observed at low
   concentrations, respectively, when local equilibrium conditions are met
   in the columns. These results, derived by stochastically analyzing the
   sorptive behavior expected during batch and column experiments, follow
   from the failure of the homogeneous-based Langmuir and Freundlich models
   to properly describe sorptive behavior in the ensembles of particles
   composing the media. As the variability in the underlying sorptive
   properties increases, the Langmuir isotherm ceases to describe well the
   behavior of the aggregate of (individually Langmuir) particles both
   under static (batch) and dynamic (column) conditions. In such composite
   porous media there tends to be an inherent uncertainty involved with
   characterizing sorptive behavior at lower concentrations.}},

Title = {{HYDROGEOCHEMISTRY OF THE SHALLOW DUTCH GROUNDWATER - INTERPRETATION OF
   THE NATIONAL GROUNDWATER QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2993-3004}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Since 1979 the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and
   Environmental Protection (RIVM) has been developing the Dutch
   Groundwater Quality Monitoring Network (LMG). This network presently
   consists of about 350 monitoring sites. At each site, well screens are
   placed at two depths: 10 and 25 m below surface level. Samples are
   collected every year and are analyzed for all macrochemical parameters
   and some trace elements. Tritium contents were measured in the first
   sampling round. The geochemistry of Dutch groundwater is complex, due to
   the different sources (seawater, surface water and rainwater),
   complicated hydrogeology, and human impact on flow systems and
   pollution. Structuring or data analysis is required for the
   interpretation of the large number of hydrogeochemical data from such a
   monitoring network. An exploratory approach is to look within the data
   set for homogeneous groups, each with a typical (macro)chemistry. The
   selection criteria for the location of the monitoring sites of the LMG
   are mainly based on soil type and land use, and to some extent on the
   hydrogeological situation. However, a classification based on the two
   most reliable criteria, soil type and land use, does not result in
   chemically distinguishable homogeneous groups or water types. Fuzzy c
   means clustering was successfully used to discern structure and natural
   groups in the LMG data for 1 year. A seven-cluster model was adopted.
   The number of clusters was decided heuristically with the aid of
   nonlinear mapping, on the basis of the geographic distribution, the
   hydrogeochemical interpretability, and the unimodality of the
   distribution of the parameters per cluster. The consistency of the model
   is illustrated by the reproducibility of the clusters in different
   years. The clusters are related to geochemical processes, natural
   sources, and anthropogenic input and are designated as follows: (1)
   `'seawater'' in coastal areas, (2) `'desalinization'' in organic-rich
   Holocene marine and peat deposits, (3) `'surface water'' for downward
   seeping river water or surface water near the main rivers, (4)
   `'carbonate/reduction'' in peat areas or old groundwater in seepage
   zones, (5) `'carbonate'' for carbonate-dissolving `'precipitation,'' (6)
   acid `'precipitation'' water in sandy topographic highs, and (7) a
   `'polluted'' cluster characterized by agricultural contaminants.
   Although the influence of soil type and land use is noticeable in some
   of the clusters, the geochemical controls, which characterize the
   different clusters, appear to outweigh their anticipated influence on
   the hydrogeochemistry on the scale of the national groundwater network.
   Consequently, the homogeneous groups, obtained through the cluster
   analysis, present a better base for further statistical and
   hydrogeochemical evaluation than, e.g., a stratification of the data
   based on soil type and land use.}},

Abstract = {{Cation exchange associated with displacement of aqueous solutions is a
   complex physicochemical process. In this study column experiments were
   combined with numerical modeling to determine the controlling chemical
   processes for natural systems at near-neutral pH. The experimental
   results showed the importance of two processes in addition to exchange
   between free cations: exchange of monovalent metal-bicarbonate complexes
   and proton buffering. The former primarily results from changes in CO2
   pressure, whereas the latter results from changes in aqueous pH.
   Neglecting these two processes had little effect when modeling the
   cation elution curves. However, the pH and alkalinity breakthrough
   curves were poorly fit, since nonreactive behavior of these variables
   was assumed. Inclusion of either specific sorption of Ca and Mg hydroxy
   complexes or transfer of Al hydroxy species to or from the exchanger
   sites resulted in a better fit. It is shown theoretically that the two
   additional processes have a major impact on calcite equilibria when
   considering calcareous systems.}},

Abstract = {{Previous flume studies of the velocity of saltating grains have almost
   all measured single grains traveling in otherwise clear water. However,
   such measurements disregard the likelihood that grain velocities are
   affected by the presence of other grains. In this laboratory study of
   overland flow we show that grain velocity is negatively related to
   sediment concentration. This negative relation is attributed to two
   mechanisms. The first mechanism is a decrease in water velocity as
   sediment concentration increases. Water velocity decreases because an
   increasing proportion of potential energy is dissipated in transporting
   sediment rather than being converted to kinetic energy. The second
   mechanism is an increase in the dispersion of the normal component of
   grain momentum as grain collisions increase with sediment concentration.
   The dispersive stress so created opposes bed load movement and causes
   grain velocity to decrease. Multiple regression analyses reveal
   relations in the experimental data that are consistent with these two
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Episodic acidification was examined in five mid-Atlantic watersheds
   representing three physiographic provinces: Coastal Plain, Valley and
   Ridge, and Blue Ridge. Each of the watersheds receives a similar loading
   of atmospheric pollutants (SO42- and NO3-) and is underlain by different
   bedrock type. The purpose of this research was to quantify and compare
   the episodic variability in storm flow chemistry in Reedy Creek,
   Virginia (Coastal Plain), Mill Run and Shelter Run, Virginia (Valley and
   Ridge), and Fishing Creek Tributary and Hunting Creek, Maryland (Blue
   Ridge). Because episodic responses were similar from storm to storm in
   each of the watersheds, a representative storm from each watershed was
   discussed. Acidification, defined as the loss of acid-neutralizing
   capacity (ANC), was observed in all streams except Mill Run. Mill Run
   chemistry showed little episodic variability. During storms in the other
   streams, pH decreased while SO42-, NO3-, and K+ concentrations
   increased. Concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ increased in Reedy Creek and
   Fishing Creek Tributary, but decreased in Shelter Run and Hunting Creek.
   Therefore the net effect of episodic changes on the acid-base status
   differed among the streams. In general, greater losses of ANC were
   observed during storms at Shelter Run and Hunting Creek, watersheds
   underlain by reactive bedrock (carbonate, metabasalt); comparatively
   smaller losses in ANC were observed at Reedy Creek and Fishing Creek
   Tributary, watersheds underlain by quartzites and unconsolidated quartz
   sands and cobbles. Increased SO42- concentrations were most important
   during storms at Reedy Creek and Fishing Creek Tributary, but organic
   anions (inferred by anion deficit) were also a factor in causing the
   loss of ANC. Dilution of base cations was the most important factor in
   the loss of ANC at Shelter Run. Both increased sulfate and dilution of
   base flow were important in causing the episodic acidification at
   Hunting Creek. The role of SO42- in contributing to episodic
   acidification in these watersheds is similar to that documented in
   studies conducted in other regions of the United States, Scandinavia,
   Canada, and the United Kingdom. The importance of SO42- in mid-Atlantic
   United States streams contrasts with northeastern United States streams,
   in which increased NO3- derived from snowpack is more important in
   causing episodic acidification. Results support the importance of
   shallow subsurface processes in determining storm flow chemistry,
   regional climatic characteristics in determining the different sources
   of acidity during episodes, and the importance of bedrock geology in
   determining the amount of ANC loss.}},

Title = {{ESTIMATION OF LAKE HYDROLOGIC BUDGET TERMS USING THE SIMULTANEOUS
   SOLUTION OF WATER, HEAT, AND SALT BALANCES AND A KALMAN FILTERING
   APPROACH - APPLICATION TO LAKE KINNERET}},

Abstract = {{The Lake Kinneret hydrologic budget includes two unknown terms:
   evaporation losses Q(e), and inflow from hot saline springs which
   represent the groundwater component, Q(s). This last term affects also
   the salt budget as well as the energy budget of the lake, which is, in
   turn, the basis for evaporation estimates. A new approach consisting of
   the simultaneous solution of the water, heat, and salt balance equations
   is presented to evaluate Q(e) and Q(s). This approach gives a better
   estimation of evaporation, since it accounts for the net energy advected
   to the lake. Neglecting this term led to overestimation of evaporation
   during the dry winter of 1991 and to underestimation during the whole
   year of 1992, which was particularly rainy. The maximal monthly error
   occurred for both years in February: +55\% for 1991, and -29\% for 1992.
   The application of the approach to the period of 1988-1991 shows that
   the annual hydrograph of the saline springs system is characterized by
   two distinct periods of high discharge during each year. The first
   period, in winter, seems to be related to the structure and timing of
   the rainfall season. The second occurs generally at the beginning of the
   summer, after the rainfall season has ended. The overall trend for the
   period is declining peaks and annual discharges, which is consistent
   with the hydrologic impact of a 3-year drought since 1989. The measured,
   as well as the estimated, components of the water balance equation are
   subject to uncertainty. The formulation of the balance equation in terms
   of a state-space system and the application of the Kalman filter (KF)
   allows quantifying the effect of this uncertainty on the different
   components. Therefore for given noise statistics and a priori data, it
   is possible to determine the optimal linear estimates of the estimated
   components and to compare them to the values resulting from the
   simultaneous solution approach. The method was applied on monthly water
   budgets for a period of 60 months. The effect on evaporation varies
   within a range of +/-5\%. The estimate of runoff from the ungauged part
   of the direct watershed was generally increased by the KF, especially
   during the rainy winter of 1988. The effect on this estimate varies
   within a range of +/-12\%. The component that was affected the most is
   the estimated discharge from the saline springs system (+/-15\%). The KF
   increases by 15\% the winter peak of 1988 and decreases all the
   discharges estimates for the dry years, especially those of 1990.
   Therefore the stochastic approach strengthens the agreement between the
   trends in the estimated values and in the climatic conditions during the

Abstract = {{A review of a calibration method developed earlier (Ibrahim and Liong,
   1992) is presented. The method generates optimal values for single
   events. It entails randomizing the calibration parameters over bounds
   such that a system response under consideration is bounded. Within the
   bounds, which are narrow and generated automatically, explicit response
   surface representation of the response is obtained using experimental
   design techniques and regression analysis. The optimal values are
   obtained by searching on the response surface for a point at which the
   predicted response is equal to the measured response and the value of
   the joint probability density function at that point in a transformed
   space is the highest. The method is demonstrated on a catchment in
   Singapore. The issue of global optimal values is addressed by applying
   the method on wider bounds. The results indicate that the optimal values
   arising from the narrow set of bounds are, indeed, global. Improvements
   which are designed to achieve comparably accurate estimates but with
   less expense are introduced. A linear response surface model is used.
   Two approximations of the model are studied. The first is to fit the
   model using data points generated from simple Monte Carlo simulation;
   the second is to approximate the model by a Taylor series expansion.
   Very good results are obtained from both approximations. Two methods of
   obtaining a single estimate from the individual event's estimates of the
   parameters are presented. The simulated and measured hydrographs of four
   verification storms using these estimates compare quite well.}},

   THE CASE OF THE NEGEV DESERT, ISRAEL}},

Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{A management model is presented for the optimal development of marginal
   water sources in arid zones in conjunction with minimizing the
   dependence on high-quality water. These marginal sources, which may
   include among others saline groundwater, treated wastewater, and runoff
   water, are required to augment a limited supply from regional sources.
   The objective is to minimize operational and capital costs while
   simultaneously allocating a conventional regional supply in a best way
   among a set of local sites. A novel aspect is the consideration of water
   quality as an additional constraint in the decision model. In this way
   an optimal investment strategy for marginal water source development and
   use is obtained while satisfying quality requirements at the individual
   sites. The model formulated takes the form of a mixed binary integer
   linear problem. The main purpose of the presented model is to delineate
   a methodology for marginal water considerations and development in arid
   zones. Water qualities, supply and demand for diverse uses, and related
   costs are of primary importance. Several simplifying assumptions are
   made, such as aggregation on an annual basis, in order to cope with the
   essential features of the problem at a reasonable level of complexity.
   These assumptions may be relaxed at a later, more detailed stage of
   analysis. A case study of the Negev Desert in southern Israel is shown.
   An important conclusion is that saline groundwater production at local
   demand sites should be increased dramatically. The usefulness of
   sensitivity analysis in the decision process is also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural production systems provide some unique challenges for
   assessing the regional impacts of water quality protection policies. A
   modeling framework is proposed for assessing the environmental and
   economic consequences of groundwater quality protection policies at the
   regional level. The model consists of three components: (1) a crop
   simulation/chemical transport model, (2) a regional economic
   optimization model, and (3) an aquifer groundwater flow model. The three
   submodels are linked and run recursively to simulate producer response
   to alternative water quality policies over a multiple-year time horizon.
   Model solutions provide projections of production practices employed on
   various resource situations across the region. Economic evaluation of
   alternative policies may he based upon regional agricultural income,
   crop production levels, input use, and changes in aquifer water levels
   over time. Measures of agricultural nonpoint source pollution provided
   by the model include nitrate, phosphorus and pesticide loadings in deep
   percolation and runoff water, as well as sediment losses.}},

Abstract = {{A three-stage modeling framework is applied to evaluate the potential
   economic and environmental impacts of agricultural groundwater
   protection policies in the Central High Plains Region. Three alternative
   policies (limitations on total nitrogen applications, limitations on
   unit-area nitrogen applications, and restrictions on the use of selected
   herbicides) are compared to a baseline scenario that reflects the
   absence of any form of groundwater quality protection measures. In
   general, nitrogen restrictions are more effective in reducing nitrate
   loadings in percolation water if implemented on a unit-area basis rather
   than as a total (farm level) restriction. In contrast, the total
   restriction is more effective in controlling runoff losses of nitrogen.
   Both nitrogen restrictions have significant impacts on crop production
   levels and regional agricultural income, while the economic consequences
   of the pesticide restriction are much less pronounced. The proposed
   regional modeling framework provides critical information necessary to
   assess the economic and environmental tradeoffs of policy alternatives
   aimed at controlling agricultural nonpoint source pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Previously developed suites of models integrate irrigation water supply
   and demand management for simplified surface reservoir supply systems, A
   central stochastic dynamic programming model is supported by simulation
   models, including a soil water-plant growth model. That modeling is
   extended herein to include decisions about timing and quantity of
   reservoir water releases into the delivery system, resulting in the
   integration of supply, demand, and delivery management. Irrigators have
   rights to percentages of reservoir capacity, reservoir inflows, and
   downstream tributary flows. Natural rivers are the supply channels in
   the study area. Large on-farm water storages exist for storing regulated
   and unregulated river flows available to the irrigators. Farms can be
   many days flow from the reservoir, requiring orders for reservoir
   releases to be lodged before the arrival of a previous order. The
   probability of unregulated flows from tributaries downstream of the
   reservoir further complicates ordering decisions. Abandonment of
   irrigated area to rain-fed status occurs at two levels, forced
   abandonment if insufficient water is available at the farm when the
   irrigation-trigger soil water deficit is reached, and planned
   abandonment to save water for possible later use. The need for forced
   abandonment is determined by simulation models; planned abandonment
   decisions are derived by stochastic dynamic programming. Results show
   annual net revenue means and standard deviations as functions of
   different capacities of the on-farm storages and water supplies from
   either regulated or unregulated flows, or both}},

Abstract = {{Transaction cost has been a frequent topic in theoretical and practical
   discussions of water transfers. However, the risk or probability that a
   transfer effort will be unsuccessful should also have a significant
   effect on the decision by potential water purchasers to seek water
   transfers in lieu of seeking water by conventional means (source
   capacity expansion or water conservation). The importance of the
   uncertainty of transfer completion is examined analytically under a
   decision theory framework. Some implications of uncertain transaction
   completion for water transfer policy are discussed. In general, seeking
   water transfers becomes more attractive to potential water purchasers if
   the probability of a successful transfer is increased, if more of the
   transaction costs for water transfers are incurred after a transfer has
   been approved, and if the costs of delaying implementation of
   alternative water supplies are small.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional model for water transport and ice lensing in
   incompressible saturated and solute-free soil specimens is proposed for
   the simulation of small-scale frost heave tests in the laboratory. The
   model considers (1) open-system freezing in which the variables T and
   P(w) are independent, (2) an ice lens that continues to grow as long as
   enough energy is available in the frozen fringe to produce the work
   required for mass transfer to the ice lens, and (3) a new ice lens that
   forms when the vertical strain in the frozen soil reaches the
   instantaneous tensile failure strain. The proposed frost heave model is
   amenable to computer simulation procedures which provide predictions of
   rate of frost heave and rate of pore freezing front penetration as
   functions of applied load, thermal and water flow regimes, and soil
   properties. Position, time of initiation, and ultimate thickness of
   individual ice lenses emerge also as a part of the solution. A
   quantitative comparison of observed and simulated responses for various
   boundary conditions is shown for a reference soil known as Devon silt.
   The model was found to exhibit many of the characteristics observed in
   frost heave tests on Devon silt and predicted the effects of overburden
   pressure on frost heave rate.}},

Abstract = {{Development of the partial differential equation of stream function psi
   in two-dimensional groundwater flow is based on the assumption that the
   curl of hydraulic gradient vector (del x delphi) is equal to zero. The
   equation of psi is expressed in terms of hydraulic conductivity. This
   equation is valid for steady state groundwater flow only. In this paper,
   two partial differential equations of stream functions X and A in
   three-dimensional groundwater flow are developed. In development of
   these equations, it is assumed that the curl of pseudopotential gradient
   (del x delbeta) is equal to zero. Pseudopotential gradient is the
   hydraulic gradient in the direction of flow. The equations of chi and
   lambda are expressed in terms of pseudopotential conductivity.
   Pseudopotential conductivity is the hydraulic conductivity in the
   direction of flow. It is a scalar function and can be defined in terms
   of hydraulic gradient and hydraulic conductivity. Therefore besides
   being valid for steady state flow, the equations of chi and lambda can
   be applied to evaluate stream functions in anisotropic porous media at a
   given point in time. provided that the hydraulic gradient field is known
   at the point in time. Application of the chi and lambda equations is
   demonstrated by considering steady state groundwater flow under the
   Borden landfill in Ontario, Canada. The two equations will be valuable
   in visualization of groundwater flow and contaminant transport, design
   of numerical solution grids for contaminant transport modeling, and
   design of contaminant remediation well systems.}},

Abstract = {{A new numerical approach is proposed to solve the equations of flow and

   formulation using basis functions of arbitrary order (spectral
   elements). An appropriate choice of the nodal points and the integration

   The transport equation is solved by combining a spectral approximation

   term. which is aided by the most precise interpolation possible with the
   spectral method. The formulation is shown to yield an accurate
   description of very steep fronts with reasonable computer resources.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic containment of a groundwater plume is modeled as a
   pump-and-treat system of extraction wells in a confined aquifer with
   uncertain transmissivity. The transmissivity is modeled as a random
   field with a specified covariance structure, conditioned at measurement
   locations. The response matrix method is used to form a linear program
   to obtain the optimal pumping strategy. High reliability is achieved by
   employing a multiple realization or `'stacking'' method which requires
   the solution to simultaneously satisfy a number of reaiizations of the
   random field. Empirical tests indicate that this reliability is a
   monotonically increasing function of the number of stacked realizations
   and appears to be relatively insensitive to moderate changes in the
   variance, correlation length, and covariance structure of the stochastic
   transmissivity and to changes in the boundary conditions and measurement
   data. Two simple statistical models based on Bayesian analysis and order
   statistics are formulated, leading to predicted reliabilities of (N +
   1)/(N + 2) and N/(N + 1), respectively, where N is the number of stacked
   realizations. These simple curves are shown to compare quite well with
   the empirical findings. These results indicate that it may be possible
   to determine the stack size necessary to achieve a prespecified
   reliability. The robustness of the reliability curve indicates that it
   may be useful as a preliminary design tool for aquifer management.}},

Abstract = {{Many models for calculating hydraulic conductivity assume that the pore
   size distribution of a medium can be uniquely derived from the water
   retention curve. We examine this assumption by comparing water retention
   curves from simulations of drainage and imbibition of a domain network
   model to curves derived solely from the input pore size distribution. We
   use domain networks rather than the more usual oil reservoir pore scale
   networks to account for features of soils not commonly found in oil
   reservoirs. Simulated drainage and imbibition curves are substantially
   different from the input curve due to (1) the presence of a threshold in
   both the simulated drainage and imbibition curves and (2) the presence
   of entrapped air during imbibition. Differences between the simulated
   and input curves increase or decrease depending upon the network size,
   the type of percolation mechanism considered for drainage and
   imbibition, the aspect ratio of the pores, and the coordination number
   of the medium.}},

Abstract = {{Structure, meaning a nonrandom arrangement of pores or pore domains, is
   present in many geologic porous media. We examined the effects of
   different nonrandom arrangements of the pore domains containing the
   largest pores on the percolation and flow properties of a simulated
   porous medium. Increasing the length of clusters (structural elements),
   or the fraction of the pore space occupied by them, decreases the
   percolation threshold (air entry value) and increases the permeability.
   Decreasing the internal homogeneity of clusters decreases the extent of
   their effects on percolation and permeability. Percolation threshold is
   not affected by the ratio between cluster length and network size as
   long as the cluster length is less than two thirds the network size. All
   cluster shapes display a similar relationship between percolation
   threshold and permeability, seen also in geologic porous media. The air
   entry value is a parameter that could potentially quantify both the
   degree of structure of a medium and its saturated permeability.}},

   approximate method of localization is used to convert to with the same
   order of approximation differential equations of transport. Exact
   averaged equations for one-dimensional transport are examined, and the
   question of the consistency and asymptotic behavior for approximate
   averaged equations is discussed. A detailed investigation of transport
   in a stratified system has been carried out. The second moment of
   concentration is examined, the variance of the concentration is
   computed, and cross-correlation moments are obtained for fields of

Abstract = {{An analytical solution is derived for the advection-dispersion equation
   with rate-limited desorption and first-order decay, using an
   eigenfunction integral equations method. The model equations represent
   one-dimensional solute transport in a homogeneous isotropic porous
   medium where the porous medium is saturated with the aqueous solution.
   The flow field is uniform. Rate-limited desorption is described as a
   first-order process where the rate is proportional to the difference in
   concentration between the sorbed phase and the aqueous phase. The
   solution was verified for the limiting case of equilibrium desorption
   using the solution of van Genuchten and Alves (1982). Example
   calculations are presented to show the effect of the desorption rate,
   decay rate, and distribution coefficient on the rate of contaminant
   removal from both the aqueous and sorbed phases of a groundwater
   aquifer. The solution quantifies the expected results, where the larger
   the desorption and decay rate and the smaller the distribution
   coefficient, the faster the rate of contaminant removal from the aqueous

Abstract = {{An analytical model which provides an approximate description of
   scale-dependent transport is presented. The model is based on the
   advection-dispersion equation but with the dispersion coefficient
   dependent on the travel time of the solute from a single input source.
   The time dependence of the dispersion coefficient can assume arbitrary
   functional forms. The governing equation, which includes a time-varying
   dispersion coefficient, linear equilibrium adsorption, and first-order
   reaction. is reduced to the heat diffusion equation after a series of
   transformations. Analytical solutions pertaining to a time-varying mass
   injection in an infinite medium with arbitrary initial distribution of
   concentration and functional dependence of the dispersion coefficient
   can be easily derived from the model. Since the analytical solution is
   in an integral form, different temporal variation of the dispersion
   coefficient over different time intervals can also be incorporated. It
   is shown that the solution reduces to the well-known result for the case
   of constant dispersion and mass injection. In this study, particular
   solutions for various dispersion functions and mass injection scenarios
   are presented. These include linear, exponential, and asymptotic
   variation of the dispersion functions and instantaneous as well as
   continuous mass injection. The analytical results could model the
   transport of solute in a hydrogeologic system characterized by a
   dispersion coefficient that varies as a function of travel time from the
   input source. It could provide a modeling solution to solute transport
   problems in heterogeneous media and be used as a suitable model for the
   inversion problem, especially since more than one fitting parameter is
   available to fit the field tracer data which exhibit a scale effect.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions for the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) usually
   assume that boundary and initial conditions are orthogonal to the
   principal axes of the dispersion tensor. However, this is not always the
   case in field studies or modeling scenarios. Using the method of Green's
   functions, a generalized analytical solution of the three-dimensional
   ADE set in an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system (i.e., not
   orthogonal to the principal flow direction) is given for the solute
   resident concentration in a semi-infinite porous medium with an
   arbitrary initial condition, surface boundary condition, and sink/source
   terms. Two particular solutions for a rectangular surface flux boundary
   condition and a buried parallelopiped, respectively, are derived from
   the general solution. The corresponding frequency domain solutions are
   also given which provide a more efficient method of computation for
   generating two-and three-dimensional grids via use of a two-dimensional
   fast Fourier transform algorithm (as an alternative to the
   two-dimensional numerical integration required to calculate the
   concentration using the real space solution). When the arbitrary
   coordinate system is orthogonal to the principal axes, It is shown that
   these particular solutions are the same as previously published results.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most promising approaches for modeling solute transport in
   heterogeneous aquifers describes the natural variability in hydraulic
   conductivity by means of a stationary random field. Therefore the solute
   concentration distribution at a given time also becomes a random field.
   For the case of an inert solute, Dagan (1982, 1984) found a solution for
   the temporal evolution of the spatial moments of the ensemble average
   concentration random field; this solution describes the impact of
   small-scale heterogeneity upon large-scale spreading of the plume (the
   so-called macrodispersion phenomenon). In this paper we extend Dagan's
   (1982, 1984) results to the case of a reactive solute undergoing linear
   reversible adsorption. We assume spatially uniform kinetic rate
   coefficients. The solution obtained explicitly quantifies the combined
   effect of nonequilibrium adsorption reactions and macrodispersion, for a
   range of possible time scales of both processes. We show that for very
   large times the effects of macrodispersion and kinetics are additive,
   while for shorter times they are related in a nonlinear fashion. As a
   particular application of our solution, we demonstrate that the
   conditions necessary for the existence of local equilibrium depend not
   only on the kinetic rate coefficients but also upon the spatial
   structure of the conductivity field. The observed behavior of an organic
   solute used in the Borden field experiment appears to be consistent with
   the predictions of the new model.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical approach is developed for describing the ensemble average
   of the second moment of a solute plume in heterogeneous porous media.
   The growth of the ensemble average second moment is related to the
   growth of the mean square separation of a pair of particles. Exact
   Lagrangian expressions are developed for the growth of the mean square
   separation in a perfectly stratified aquifer. These exact expressions
   are made possible by an exact relation between the Lagrangian and
   Eulerian velocity covariances in the perfectly stratified aquifer. The
   ensemble average second moment is shown to depend on the initial
   vertical dimensions of the concentration distribution. As the vertical
   size increases, the second moment growth rate is larger. The second
   moment expressions are contrasted with the expressions for the mean
   square displacement of a single particle. While all scales of
   heterogeneity contribute to the mean square displacement of a single
   particle, only scales of heterogeneity smaller than the plume size
   contribute to the second moment. Asymptotic large displacement
   expressions for the case of a Gaussian covariance function describing
   the hydraulic conductivity variations are derived. These expressions
   indicate that at large displacement, the second moment grows as the 3/2
   power of displacement. However, for any finite source size no matter how
   large, the second moment growth rate approaches a different asymptote
   from the rate of growth of the mean square displacement of a single
   particle. This is in conflict with the traditional notion of ergodicity
   which leads to the expectation that for large source sizes, the
   dispersivity approaches the rate of growth of the mean square
   displacement of a single particle.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical approach is developed for describing the ensemble average
   of the second moment of a solute plume in three-dimensional
   heterogeneous porous media. While existing approaches describe
   scale-dependent dispersion in terms of a single scale, the plume
   displacement, the approach developed here presents an enhanced picture
   of scale-dependent dispersion involving two scales: the plume
   displacement and the plume scale. The plume scale arises naturally in
   the formulation, permitting a distinction between the dispersive role of
   heterogeneity at scales smaller than the plume size and the variability
   in the plume location caused by larger scale heterogeneity. A physically
   consistent description of scale-dependent dispersion is thus achieved.
   The growth of the ensemble average second moment is related to the
   product of concentration values at two points. The concept of the
   separation distribution function related to the latter is introduced.
   The separation distribution function physically describes the fraction
   of solute particles which have another solute particle at a given
   separation. An Eulerian partial differential equation based on a small
   perturbation approach is developed to describe the evolution of the
   separation distribution function. Simple analytical expressions for the
   second moment growth rates are presented. These expressions incorporate
   the influence of the plume size through a low wavenumber filter
   depending of the plume second moment. Asymptotic expressions for the
   second moment growth rate are presented which apply at large
   displacement. These expressions indicate that the longitudinal second
   moment growth rate depends on the transverse second moments of the
   plume. Comparison of predicted second moment evolution with results from
   earlier numerical simulations indicates excellent agreement. Application
   to the Borden tracer test indicates a significant reduction in the
   longitudinal second moment from that predicted by existing
   three-dimensional theories and better agreement with the measured second
   moments.}},

Abstract = {{Differential dynamic programming is used to compute optimal time-varying
   pumping policies for a pump and treat strategy for groundwater
   remediation. The feedback law generated by a constrained differential
   dynamic programming algorithm with penalty functions is used as the
   basis of feedback laws tested in cases where there is uncertainty in the
   hydraulic conductivity. Confined transient aquifer flow and transport
   are modeled using a two-dimensional Galerkin finite element scheme with
   implicit time differencing. Optimal policies are calculated using a
   given or `'measured'' set of hydraulic conductivities and initial
   conditions. The optimal policies (with and without feedback) are applied
   using the same finite element model with a second or `'true'' set of
   conductivities. The `'true'' sets of conductivities are generated
   randomly from an autocorrelated lognormal distribution by the spectral
   method. The approach used here has an advantage over other uncertainty
   approaches because it is not necessary to specify precisely which
   parameters are considered uncertain and which are certain. Also no
   single probability distribution need be assumed for each uncertain
   parameter. By adjusting the relative weight assigned each penalty
   function, robust feedback laws were obtained that perform equally well
   under nine different assumed error distributions. In our examples,
   well-designed feedback policies cost between 4\% and 51\% less than the
   cost of applying the calculated optimal policies without using a
   feedback law.}},

Abstract = {{A stability analysis of the classical Crank-Nicolson-Galerkin (CNG)
   scheme applied to the one-dimensional solute transport equation is
   proposed on the basis of two fairly different approaches. Using a
   space-time eigenvalue analysis, it is shown, al least for subsurface
   hydrology applications, that the CNG scheme is theoretically stable
   under the condition PeCr less-than-or-equal-to 2, where Pe and Cr are
   the mesh Peclet and Courant numbers. Then, to assess the computational
   stability of the scheme, the amplification matrix is constructed, and
   its norm is displayed in the (Pe, Cr) space. The results indicate that
   the norm of the amplification matrix is never smaller than unity and
   exhibits a hyperbolic nature analogous to the above theoretical
   condition.}},

Abstract = {{Best estimates of evaporation at Williams Lake, north central Minnesota,
   were determined by the energy budget method using optimum sensors and
   optimum placement of sensors. These best estimates are compared with
   estimates derived from using substitute data to determine the effect of
   using less accurate sensors, simpler methods, or remotely measured data.
   Calculations were made for approximately biweekly periods during five
   open water seasons. For most of the data substitutions that affected the
   Bowen ratio, new values of evaporation differed little from best
   estimates. The three data substitution methods that caused the largest
   deviations from the best evaporation estimates were (1) using changes in
   the daily average surface water temperature as an indicator of the lake
   heat storage term, (2) using shortwave radiation, air temperature, and
   atmospheric vapor pressure data from a site 110 km away, and (3) using
   an analog surface water temperature probe. Recalculations based on these
   data substitutions resulted in differences from the best estimates as
   much as 89\%, 21\%, and 10\%, respectively. The data substitution method
   that provided evaporation values that most closely matched the best
   estimates was measurement of the lake heat storage term at one location
   in the lake, rather than at 16 locations. Evaporation values resulting
   from this substitution method usually were within 2\% of the best
   estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the air permeability were performed on snow from six
   horizons within a snowpack at the Glacier Lakes Ecosystems Experiment
   Site in southeastern Wyoming. The snow was new or equitemperature snow,
   with densities (rho(s)) ranging between 0.134 and 0.367 Mg m-3. The
   specific surface area of ice in each sample was measured
   stereologically. Intrinsic permeabilities (K0) calculated from these
   data ranged from 3.0 x 10(-10) to 3.1 x 10(-9) m2. The data fitted the
   equation K0 = 1.096 x 10(-8)e9.57rho(s), with a standard deviation of
   2.8 x 10(-10) m2 . A dimensionally correct relationship between
   permeability and specific surface area did not fit our data as well as a
   simple density relationship. The small scatter reported is attributed to
   careful selection of undamaged samples and the prevention of sample
   sublimation during the measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and
   unimpaired streamflow over the contiguous United States is studied. The
   extreme phases of the Southern Oscillation have been linked to fairly
   persistent classes of atmospheric anomalies over the low and middle
   latitudes at regional and global scales. Of particular interest in this
   investigation is the identification of regions of land that appear to
   have strong and consistent ENSO-related streamflow signals. The first
   harmonic extracted from a 24-month ENSO composite at each station is
   assumed to be the ENSO-related signal appearing in streamflow anomalies.
   These regions were identified by the similarity in phase of the harmonic
   vectors. The vectorial display of these harmonics over a map of the
   United States provides the areal extents of ENSO influence on
   streamflow. Coherent and significant streamflow responses to
   hypothesized ENSO forcing are found in four regions of the United

Abstract = {{Power law models that relate rainfall rate and radar reflectivity factor
   are the principal topic of this paper. Two interrelated problems
   associated with these models are examined: (1) estimation of parameters
   of power law models, and (2) assessment of the accuracy of rainfall rate
   estimates derived from power law models. A statistical model of raindrop
   processes is used for analysis of both problems. The model provides
   explicit representations of power law model parameter estimates and the
   error of rainfall rate-reflectivity relationships in terms of simple
   representations of raindrop processes. These results are used to examine
   issues related to parameterization of algorithms for radar rainfall
   estimation including (1) bounds on power law model parameter estimates,
   (2) climatological variability of power law model parameters, (3)
   seasonal variability of power law model parameters, and (4)
   multiplicative bias in radar rainfall estimates. Empirical analyses are
   carried out using drop size data from a number of sites. Detailed
   analyses are carried out for a data set from North Carolina.}},

Abstract = {{Issues of scaling characteristics in spatial rainfall have attracted
   increasing attention over the last decade. Several methods based on
   simple and multiscaling and multifractal ideas have been proposed and
   parameter estimation techniques developed for the hypothesized models.
   Simulations based on these models have realistic resemblance to
   `'generic rainfall fields.'' In this research we analyze rainfall data
   for scaling characteristics without an a priori assumed model. We look
   at the behavior of rainfall fluctuations obtained at several scales, via
   orthogonal wavelet transform of the data, to infer the precise nature of
   scaling exhibited by spatial rainfall. The essential idea behind the
   analysis is to segregate large-scale (long wavelength) features from
   small-scale features and study each of them independently. The
   hypothesis is set forward that rainfall might exhibit scaling in
   small-scale fluctuations, if at all, and at large scale this behavior
   will break down to accommodate the effects of external factors affecting
   the particular rain-producing mechanism. The validity of this hypothesis
   is examined. In the first of these papers we develop the methodology for
   the segregation of large- and small-scale features and apply it to a
   severe spring time midlatitude squall line storm. The second paper
   (Kumar and Foufoula-Georgiou, this issue) develops a framework for
   testing the presence and studying the nature of self-similarity in the
   fluctuations.}},

Abstract = {{In the first paper (Kumar and Foufoula-Georgiou, this issue) we
   developed a methodology for the segregation of large- and small-scale
   features (fluctuations) of spatial rainfall fields. In this paper we
   develop a framework for testing the presence and studying the nature of
   self-similarity in the fluctuations. It is found that rainfall
   fluctuations may be approximated by stable distributions and show
   scaling up to a certain scale. We define and estimate parameters that
   characterize the scaling and spatial dependence of the rainfall
   fluctuations and we use these parameters, estimated for several radar
   rainfall frames (in time), to relate to and identify the evolutionary
   nature of rainfall. Two radar depicted rainfall fields have been
   extensively analyzed: a severe spring time midlatitude squall line storm
   and a mild midlatitude winter type storm. The type of scaling in
   rainfall fluctuations shows significant variation from one rainfall
   field to another.}},

Abstract = {{The statistical and phenomenological aspects of the runoff process
   observed on different scales of aggregation are taken as a priori
   information for the conceptually based stochastic modeling of seasonal
   runoff. Runoff is considered as the sum of two groundwater components,
   with over-year and subannual response lag, and of a purely random
   component representing the direct runoff. This scheme is equivalent to a
   linear system, with two parallel linear reservoirs plus a zero lag
   linear channel. The system output is the runoff, and the input is the
   effective rainfall, considered proportional to the direct runoff.
   Assuming the effective rainfall as a non-Gaussian periodic independent
   process and considering nonseasonal groundwater parameters, this
   conceptualization leads to an autoregressive and moving average (2, 2)
   stochastic process with periodic independent residual. Stochastic model
   parameters are directly related to the linear system coefficients, and
   the effective rainfall structure can be determined from the estimated
   model residual. In order to obtain parameter estimates consistent with
   the conceptual constraints, two estimation stages, on an annual and a
   seasonal basis, and an iterative procedure are needed. The model was
   applied to a number of time series of monthly streamflows in the
   Apennine regions of Italy with promising results.}},

Abstract = {{The adaptive use of a conceptual model for real-time flow forecasting is
   investigated. Maximum likelihood and ordinary least squares estimation

   techniques for autocorrelated (AMLE) and heteroscedastic (HMLE) errors
   is analyzed jointly with that provided by the commonly used ordinary
   least squares estimation (OLSE) technique. Streamflow forecasts are
   compared for three rivers in central Italy, obtained by AMLE, HMLE, and
   OLSE adaptive calibration of a simple conceptual model describing the
   rainfall-runoff transformation by accounting for Hortonian infiltration
   and linear basin response to rainfall excess. Although model residuals
   display both autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, OLSE is found to
   provide a rather satisfactory performance. Because the OLSE technique
   also requires less computational effort compared to that for AMLE and
   HMLE, one could consider OLSE as a suitable option for real-time model

Abstract = {{The analysis and modeling of streamflow processes has attracted the
   attention of water resources specialists for several decades. A number
   of models have been suggested in the past for representing seasonal and
   annual streamflow processes. The topic addressed in this paper centers
   around the compatibility of stochastic models of streamflow at different
   time scales. More specifically, given a model for monthly flows, the
   models for the processes obtained by aggregation, i.e., models for
   bimonthly, quarterly, etc., time scales, are derived. Likewise,
   parameter space and covariance properties of such derived processes as
   well as the relationship of such properties of different time scales are
   given. These concepts are applied to modeling streamflow of the Niger
   River. The developments are restricted to the family of periodic
   autoregressive moving average (PARMA) processes. For instance, it was
   found that monthly flows based on the PARMA(2, 1) process leads to
   PARMA(2, 2) bimonthly flows and stationary ARMA(2, 2) annual flows.
   Furthermore, applications to modeling the Niger River flows suggest that
   one can reproduce the seasonal and annual second-order statistics
   without using disaggregation if PARMA models are used for modeling the
   seasonal flows.}},

Abstract = {{Surface runoff sensitivity to spatial and temporal variability of
   rainfall is examined using physically based numerical runoff models.
   Rainfall duration t(r) and temporal sampling interval deltat are varied
   systematically, and normalized by the time to equilibrium t(e). The
   relative sensitivity R(s) is defined as the total volume of outflow
   variability over 50 Monte Carlo simulations normalized by the rainfall
   volume and the coefficient of variation of rainfall. Relative
   sensitivity to temporal rainfall variability increases with both t(r)
   and deltat. An asymptotic R(s) value proportional to (deltat/t(e))1/2 is
   approached as t(r) >> t(e). Two-dimensional surface runoff simulations
   with spatially variable rainfall, without temporal variability, on two
   watersheds indicate that R(s) decreases as t(r)/t(e) increases.
   Normalized R(s) versus t(r)/t(e) curves are identical for two watersheds
   and a one-dimensional overland flow plane. These findings indicate that
   spatial variability is dominant when t(r) < t(e), while temporal
   variability dominates when t(r) > t(e), particularly for larger values
   of deltat/t(e).}},

Abstract = {{A common method of channel network extraction from digital elevation
   model (DEM) data is based on specification of a threshold area A(th),
   that is, the minimum support area required to drain to a point for a
   channel to form. Current efforts to predict A(th) from DEM data are
   inconclusive, and usually an arbitrary constant A(th) value is chosen
   for channel network extraction. In this paper, we study the effects of
   threshold area selection on the morphometric properties (such as
   drainage density, length of drainage paths, and external and internal
   links) and scaling properties (such as Horton's laws and fractal
   dimension) of a channel network. We also study the related problem of
   DEM data resolution and its effect on estimation of scaling properties.
   The results indicate that morphometric properties vary considerably with
   A(th), and thus values reported without their associated A(th) are
   meaningless and should be used in hydrologic analysis with caution.
   Also, the `'completeness'' of a channel network (in terms of having the
   outlet stream flowing directly into a higher-order stream) is found to
   depend on A(th) in a random unpredictable way. Even if only the complete
   channel networks are used in the analysis, the statistical variability
   of scaling properties estimates due to A(th) selection is significant
   and can be of comparable size to the variability due to DEM resolution
   and variability between estimates of different river networks. Our
   analysis highlights the need to carefully study the problem of network
   source representation or channel initiation scale from DEMs which will
   point to an appropriate A(th) for channel network extraction and
   estimation of morphometric properties.}},

Abstract = {{A Petrov-Galerkin (PG) finite element method was developed to solve the
   kinematic wave formulation of the overland flow equations. The resultant
   model uses quadratic basis functions and test functions that are
   modified by polynomials of cubic and quartic order, yielding a
   formulation that includes four PH parameters. The PG model was found to
   reduce the mean sum of square error of the solution compared to a
   conventional Bubnov-Galerkin finite element solution by about a factor
   of 3 as the Courant number (Cr) approached one. Good results were also
   achieved with the PG method for problems that resulted in shock
   formation, which are typical of many applied problems of concern. PG
   parameters were found to depend strongly upon the Courant number and
   weakly upon the number of nodes in the system. Polynomial expressions
   were derived to approximate the PG parameters over the range 0 < Cr < 1.
   As the number of nodes in the system increased, a single-parameter
   version of the model yielded solutions approaching the accuracy of the
   four-parameter model.}},

Abstract = {{For a rainfall-runoff event, quadratic programming is particularly
   suited to the estimation of unit graph as linear and positivity
   constraints on unit graph ordinates can be naturally implemented. In
   this paper, the quadratic programming framework is invoked in a novel
   way to stabilize the unit graph estimation procedure via the use of
   difference norms. The advantage of the latter over standard ridge
   regression is that penalties are placed on oscillations of the unit
   graph rather than on the size of its ordinates. Application of the
   methodology to real rainfall-runoff data is provided and comparisons
   with existing approaches are made. The latter indicate that our approach
   generally yields unit graph estimates of more realistic shape and
   smaller variance resulting in a better fit to the runoff data.}},

Abstract = {{Development of mathematical models relating the precipitation incident
   upon a catchment to the streamflow emanating from the catchment has been
   a major focus of surface water hydrology for decades. Generally, values
   for parameters in such models must be selected so that runoff calculated
   from the model `'matches'' recorded runoff from some historical period.
   Despite the fact that the physics governing the path of a drop of water
   through a catchment to the stream involves complex relationships,
   evidence indicates that the information content in a rainfall-runoff
   record is sufficient to support models of only very limited complexity.
   This begs the question of what limits the observed data place on the
   allowable complexity of rainfall-runoff models. Time series techniques
   are applied for estimating transfer functions to determine how many
   parameters are appropriate to describe the relationship between
   precipitation and streamflow in the case where data on only
   precipitation, air temperature, and streamflow are available. Statistics
   from an `'information matrix'' provide the clues necessary for
   determining allowable model complexity. Time series models are developed
   for seven catchments with widely varying physical characteristics in
   different temperate climatic regimes to demonstrate the method. It is
   found that after modulating the measured rainfall using a nonlinear loss
   function, the rainfall-runoff response of all catchments is well
   represented using a linear model. Also, for all catchments a
   two-component linear model with four parameters is the model of choice.
   The two components can be interpreted as defining a `'quick flow'' and
   `'slow flow'' response of the given catchment. The method therefore
   provides a statistically rigorous way to separate hydrographs and
   parameterize their response behavior. The ability to construct reliable
   transfer function models for describing the rainfall-runoff process
   offers a new approach to investigate empirically the controls of
   physical catchment descriptors, land use change, climate change, etc.,
   on the dynamic response of catchments through the extensive analysis of
   historical data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Trends in Pamlico River estuary ammonia nitrogen (NH4), nitrate nitrogen
   (NO3), phosphate phosphorus (PO4), chlorophyll a (chl a) and dissolved
   oxygen (DO) during the past 20-24 years were analyzed, and estimates of
   annual N and P production in the watershed over the past century were
   computed. The goal of the study was to determine whether or not the
   estuary is becoming more eutrophic. NO3 has decreased in the upper and
   middle regions of the estuary by 3-6\% yr-1 since 1970, and NH4 has
   decreased throughout the estuary at an annual rate of 5.5-7.7\% yr-1.
   Since 1967 PO4 has increased by 2\% yr-1 in the lower two thirds of the
   estuary due to discharges from a phosphate mining facility. Thus the
   inorganic N:P ratio has decreased, which suggests that N is now
   potentially more limiting than in the past. In the upper estuary, chl a
   increased at a rate of 6.6\% yr-1 since 1970, and bottom water DO
   decreased very slightly; neither showed trends in the middle and lower
   estuary regions. The weight of the evidence is that the Pamlico has not
   become more eutrophic during the past two decades. This finding is
   corroborated by the lack of a trend since 1970 in calculated N and P
   production from point and nonpoint sources in the watershed. Watershed
   nutrient production is estimated to have increased severalfold between
   1880 and 1970, but appears to have stabilized after 1970, due primarily
   to decreased application of fertilizer on croplands.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic data were combined with analysis of a natural isotope, oxygen
   18, and solutes (Ca, Mg, K, Na) to examine saturation overland flow and
   stream base cation dynamics during storms in a headwater swamp.
   Laboratory experiments were also used to study the interaction of
   mixtures of throughfall and groundwater with swamp substrates in zones
   of saturation overland flow. Increased streamflow was associated with
   decreased concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Na, whereas K concentrations
   remained constant, or increased in some storms. A comparison of chemical
   and isotopic hydrograph separation indicated that Ca, Mg, and Na were
   conservative in storms with instantaneous event water contributions
   <25\% and were reactive in storms with a larger event water component.
   Laboratory data suggested that these cations were only released rapidly
   from swamp substrates when mixed with water containing >40\% throughfall
   (event water). Stream K concentrations appear to be controlled by the
   mixture of throughfall and groundwater in saturation overland flow
   during occasional storms with high throughfall K concentrations.
   Laboratory data suggested that for most storms which have throughfall K
   concentrations of <1 mg L-1, K was released as overland flow interacts
   with swamp substrates, resulting in constant stream K concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A mass balance approach was used to determine the factors influencing
   phosphorus and nitrogen dynamics in wetlands common to headwater
   catchments of the Precambrian Shield. The relationships of runoff, water
   level, water temperature, and anoxia to the annual and seasonal total
   phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) retentions of a headwater
   Sphagnum-conifer swamp during 1987-1988 were examined. Annual retentions
   of TP (4\%) and TN (10\%) were low in the swamp. On an annual basis,
   inputs exceeded outputs of total reactive P, NO3-N, and NH4-N and
   outputs exceeded inputs of total unreactive P and total organic N.
   Seasonal trends in P and N retention were inversely correlated with
   runoff. Positive monthly retention coincided with low runoff and
   increased biotic assimilation during the growing season. Water table
   drawdown during the summer was associated with peat aeration and
   increased levels of P and N in surface and pore water. High levels of P
   and N in the swamp surface water during the fall and winter were coupled
   with increased runoff, saturated overland flow, and potentially low
   biotic assimilation resulting in a net release of TP and TN. Large flow
   through of waterborne inputs and flushing of regenerated P and N
   occurred during peak snowmelt runoff resulting in low annual retention.}},

Abstract = {{Streams in the Appalachian Mountain area of the mid-Atlantic receive
   some of the largest acidic deposition loadings of any region of the
   United States. A synthesis of the survey data from the mid-Appalachians
   yields a consistent picture of the acid base status of streams. Acidic
   streams, and streams with very low acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), are
   almost all located in small (<20 km2), upland, forested catchments in
   areas of base-poor bedrock. In the subpopulation of upland forested
   systems, which comprises about half the total stream population in the
   mid-Appalachian area, data from various local surveys show that 6-27\%
   of the streams are acidic, and about 25-50\% have ANC less than 50 mueq
   L-1. After excluding streams with acid mine drainage, National Stream
   Survey estimates for the whole region show that there are 2330 km of
   acidic streams and 7500 km of streams with ANC less than 50 mueq L-1.
   Many of the streams with base flow ANC less than 50 mueq L-1 become
   acidic during storm or snowmelt episodes. Sulfate from atmospheric
   deposition is the dominant source of strong acid anions in acidic
   mid-Appalachian streams. Their low pH (median, 4.9) and high levels of
   inorganic monomeric aluminum (median, 129 mug L-1) leached through soils
   by acidic deposition are causing damage to aquatic biota. Quantification
   of the extent of biological effects, however, is not possible with
   available data. Localized studies have shown that stream water ANC is
   closely related to bedrock mineralogy. Attempts to quantify this
   relationship across the mid-Appalachians, however, were frustrated by
   the lack of adequate scale geologic mapping throughout the region.
   Sulfate mass balance analyses indicate that soils and surface waters of
   the region have not yet realized the full effects of elevated sulfur
   deposition due to watershed sulfate retention. Sulfur retention is
   likely to decrease in the future, resulting in further losses of stream
   ANC.}},

   multivariate distributions is used to model the data. The procedure
   assumes that the measurements made on several independent

   both estimate the parameters of the models and perform the cluster

Abstract = {{The effect of physical variability upon the relative transport behavior
   of microbial-sized microspheres, indigenous bacteria, and bromide was
   examined in field and flow-through column studies for a layered, but
   relatively well sorted, sandy glaciofluvial aquifer. These
   investigations involved repacked, sieved, and undisturbed aquifer
   sediments. In the field, peak abundance of labeled bacteria traveling
   laterally with groundwater flow 6 m downgradient from point of injection
   was coincident with the retarded peak of carboxylated microspheres
   (retardation factor, RF = 1.7) at the 8.8 m depth, but preceded the
   bromide peak and the retarded microsphere peak (RF = 1.5) at the 9.0 m
   depth. At the 9.5 m depth, the bacterial peak was coincident with both
   the bromide and the microsphere peaks. Although sorption appeared to be
   a predominant mechanism responsible for immobilization of
   microbial-sized microspheres in the aquifer, straining appeared to be
   primarily responsible for their removal in 0.6-m-long columns of
   repacked, unsieved aquifer sediments. The manner in which the columns
   were packed also affected optimal size for microsphere transport, which
   in one experiment was near the size of the small (approximately 2 mum)
   groundwater protozoa (flagellates). These data suggest that variability
   in aquifer sediment structure can be important in interpretation of both
   small-scale field and laboratory experiments examining microbial
   transport behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Several published tracer tests are reexamined using the single fracture
   dispersion model (SFDM), i.e., a solution to the transport equation in
   which fractured rock is represented by a single fracture and the tracer
   is allowed to diffuse into the matrix. The model has three fitting
   parameters, i.e., the mean time of flow, dispersivity, and a diffusion
   parameter which combines such physical parameters as matrix porosity,
   coefficient of matrix diffusion. and adjusted fracture aperture. The
   model is easily calibrated yielding as good, or better, fits as did the
   models applied in original works, which were based on an assumption of
   negligible matrix diffusion and were characterized by larger numbers of
   fitting parameters. The SFDM better describes the short-term transport
   in investigated systems and/or their parameters than models applied so
   far. Validation of the model was obtained by showing that the values of
   its physical parameters either agree with those known from other methods
   or are within expected ranges. Another validation was achieved for tests
   performed in the same pair of wells with two tracers characterized by
   distinctly different coefficients of molecular diffusion. In spite of
   distinct differences in the shapes of the experimental curves, the SFDM
   yielded the same values of the fracture aperture, matrix porosity, and
   intrinsic dispersivity. The ratio of the diffusion coefficients in the
   matrix was close to that known from the diffusion coefficients in free
   water.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal distribution of solutes in groundwater is
   controlled by several physical and chemical processes. Among the
   chemical processes, sequential degradation phenomena play an important
   role in determining the fate of radioactive materials and certain types
   of organic compounds. We present a numerical model designed to evaluate
   the simultaneous transport and kinetically controlled sequential
   degradation (straight and branched chains) of several dissolved
   components in groundwater systems. The model utilizes a two-step
   quasi-linearization algorithm to solve the equations of chemical
   transport and transformation. The transport equations are solved
   explicitly using the integral finite difference method. The chemical
   transformation equations are solved using an implicit finite difference
   (in time) algorithm for each volume element in the discretized flow
   domain. Although this algorithm is designed to solve problems involving
   first-order kinetics, it may be modified in certain instances to
   accommodate rate mechanisms other than first order. The chemical
   transformation module and the transport module are coupled via a
   source/sink term in the transport equation. This combination results in
   a numerical code that is computationally efficient. We have found that
   the model yields solutions which are in excellent agreement with
   available analytical solutions. Solution of a test problem based on the
   sequential degradation of the pesticide aldicarb demonstrates that the
   model can provide useful insights into the fate of solutes subject to
   certain degradation regimes in heterogeneous groundwater systems.
   Although the illustrative examples presented are one dimensional, the
   model itself is capable of handling two- and three-dimensional problems.
   In addition, the modular structure of the model is built upon
   user-specified chemical reactions. This allows for flexibility in
   problem definition, which may accommodate both reversible and
   irreversible reactions.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model that simulates groundwater flow and solute transport
   for cases in which fluid properties are variable was applied in one
   dimension (vertical) to the shallow, low-permeability, clayey, confining
   layer in Donana National Park in southwestern Spain. The salinity in the
   80-m-thick confining layer decreases from a brine near the land surface
   to fresh water near its base. Results of model simulations indicate that
   the system could be in or close to a steady state condition. The model
   calibration was very sensitive to small variations in individual model
   parameters and was nonunique in the sense that equally good calibrations
   could be achieved by compensatory joint perturbations in the
   permeability, diffusion coefficient, and overall governing hydraulic
   gradient. At present, there is probably an upward flow of the order of 1
   mm yr-1 to 1 cm yr-1 and a balance in the solute flux between upward
   advection and downward diffusion. The time scale of calculated responses
   to changes in boundary conditions in this low-permeability system ranges
   from thousands to hundreds of thousands of years when considering
   extremes within the range of uncertainty of values of the evaluated
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is often the single most important
   soil property in vadose zone flow and transport. However, at depths
   below the root zone there is no field method available to determine it.
   The proposed method is directed toward developing a practical field tool
   to determine unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in discrete intervals
   over any depth. The basic idea is to inject water at a point and monitor
   the steady state pressure distribution surrounding the source. We have
   developed an analytical solution to use either the observed steady state
   pressure heads at several points due to a single injection, or steady
   pressure heads at a single point due to multiple injections, to
   determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The approach is based
   on a linearization of the unsaturated flow equation which uses the
   piecewise exponential model of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.
   Examples of hydraulic conductivity calculations for three different
   soils give excellent results.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration from bare soil and phreatophytes is a principal
   mechanism of groundwater discharge in arid and semiarid regions of the
   midwestern and western United States including the Great Basin. The
   imbalance between independent estimates of groundwater recharge from
   precipitation and of groundwater discharge based on estimates of
   groundwater evapotranspiration leads to large uncertainties in
   groundwater budgets. Few studies have addressed this problem. Energy
   budget micrometeorological field studies were conducted in a stand of
   sparse-canopy greasewood growing in an area of shallow groundwater in
   the western Great Basin during the summer of 1989. The data were used to
   calculate above-canopy fluxes of sensible and latent heat using the
   energy budget-Bowen ratio method. The calculated energy budget fluxes
   were used, with soil surface and plant canopy temperature measurements,
   to calibrate and apply a two-component, energy-combination model that
   partitions the energy and heat fluxes between bare soil and the canopy.
   This permitted the separation of evaporation from the soil and
   transpiration from greasewood. The calibrated model was used to estimate
   daily transpiration of groundwater by greasewood growing in an area with
   a depth to water of about 2 m. The daily rate of groundwater discharge
   by transpiration during July and August was estimated to be 2.4 mm. A
   period of 100 days for groundwater discharge at this rate was assumed to
   estimate an annual discharge of groundwater of 24 cm at the study site.}},

Abstract = {{Four infiltration models for disc tension permeameters were compared to
   field and simulated data. Comparisons were made in order to assess the
   alternative values of sorptivity and steady state flow rates. Model 1
   was the conventional analysis with assumptions of one-dimensional flow
   at small times and Wooding's steady state flow rate at large times.
   Model 2 was a modified Horton equation defined to fit one-dimensional
   infiltration at small times with an exponential decay to a steady state
   value for large times. Model 3 assumed linear diffusion for a soil with
   constant diffusivity ignoring gravity. Model 4 was based on
   `'linearized'' flow with gravity. The number of unknown parameters to be
   estimated ranged from one to four. Sorptivity data using models 2 and 3
   generally agreed with the conventional method (model 1) both for the
   field and simulated data. For the steady state infiltration rate, all of
   the models gave generally consistent results. Model 2 with four
   parameters was the best fitting model to field and simulated data. The
   simulated data allowed comparisons of results based on the total time
   over which the parameters were evaluated. Results were sensitive to the
   time of evaluation up to 0.3-1.3 hours for the sandy loam soil.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical solution of a radial flow to a pumping
   well at constant discharge located in a multilayered leaky aquifer
   system. The aquifer system is composed of alternating layer of aquifers
   and aquitards and is modeled after the theory of Neuman-Witherspoon and
   Herrera. The resulting coupled integrodifferential equation system is
   handled by the Laplace transform technique which removes not only the
   time variable but also the convolutional integral. Green's functions for
   the coupled elliptic partial differential equations are then sought.
   Utilizing a numerical Laplace inversion algorithm, the drawdown at any
   given time and location in any layer can be evaluated. Several examples
   are given for validation and exploration purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary element algorithm for the multilayered leaky aquifer system
   of Neuman-Witherspoon and Herrera is presented. By applying the Laplace
   transform to the integrodifferential equations of Herrera, a set of
   coupled two-dimensional elliptic equations results. The boundary
   integral representation is derived from Green's theorem. Green's
   functions governed by an adjoint system of the original governing
   equations are found from the pumping well solutions given in part 1 by a
   coefficient exchange. The resultant numerical system requires a
   discretization only at the boundaries of the planar aquifers and is free
   from aquitard unknowns. Several numerical examples, including
   one-dimensional flow, pumping well problems, and two-dimensional
   problems are provided for the purpose of validation and demonstration.}},

Abstract = {{A new Bayesian method is developed to identify the spatial distribution
   of permeabilities. In addition to sparsely sampled permeability and
   pressure data, this approach incorporates densely sampled seismic
   velocity data along with semiempirical relationships between seismic and
   hydraulic soil properties. The procedure consists first of performing a
   hydrological inversion based solely on the permeability and pressure
   data. In light of the available seismic data, the
   velocity-permeability-pressure relationships are then used to update, in
   a Bayesian sense, the image of the permeability field. To investigate
   the usefulness of this approach, synthetic case studies are performed.
   These studies demonstrate that, even when the seismic data are corrupted
   by a significant level of error, a joint geophysical-hydrological
   inversion can produce improved images of permeability. Moreover, this
   paper derives rigorously the bounds on the error that can be tolerated
   in seismic velocities such that they are still useful for hydrological
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional solutions for the hydraulic head and velocity
   components for transient ground-water flow in an unconfined compressible
   aquifer of finite thickness with a rectangular areal recharge source are
   analyzed using a linearized mathematical model. The solution generalizes
   Dagan's (1967) results, which were obtained for an idealized aquifer of
   infinite thickness, and Hantush's (1967) results, which were derived
   using the Dupuit assumptions. Hydraulic head and velocity components are
   estimated by asymptotic methods for large times, which are most
   appropriate for contaminant transport problems. Numerical analysis of
   the solution demonstrates spatial features of the velocity components in
   general and a transient effect of upward flow in particular, similar to
   that found for circular sources (Zlotnik and Ledder, 1992). Obtained
   formulas show that applicability of the Dupuit assumption for
   computation of velocity components in an unconfined aquifer is limited
   to a far-field zone given approximately by Absolute value of x > 1.5X,
   Absolute value of y > 1.5Y, where X and Y are the half width and
   half-length, respectively, of the contaminant source.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple migration pathways and the need to consider several potential
   siting horizons render the problem of groundwater monitoring network
   design a difficult task for three-dimensional systems. While the
   application of quantitative simulation-based approaches for this problem
   is often impractical due to computational requirements, qualitative
   approaches can be ineffective because they are highly subjective and
   typically lack a set of well-defined criteria for locating sampling
   sites. An analytically based methodology developed in this paper
   integrates the practical implementation aspects of a qualitative
   approach with a quantitative analysis in deriving groundwater monitoring
   networks geared toward early detection of migrating contaminant.
   Monitoring wells are located among sets of candidate nodes in each of
   several hydrostratigraphic intervals on the basis of contamination
   susceptibility. Susceptibility is defined by nodal weights, which are
   derived on the basis of the locations of sites relative to contaminant
   source boundaries and potential contaminant plumes. As is illustrated
   from the results of a case study application, derived monitoring network
   configurations exhibit two key characteristics: (1) clustering of wells
   around outlets at contaminant source boundaries and (2) coverage of
   vacant areas in multiple siting horizons that are susceptible to
   contamination.}},

Abstract = {{The pioneering work of Jaynes in Bayesian/maximum entropy methods has
   been successfully explored in many disciplines. The principle of maximum
   entropy (PME) is a powerful and versatile tool of inferring a
   probability distribution from constraints that do not completely
   characterize that distribution. Minimum relative entropy (MRE) is a
   method which has all the important attributes of the maximum entropy
   approach with the advantage that prior information may be easily
   included. In this paper we use MRE to determine the prior probability
   density function (pdf) of a set of model parameters based on limited
   information. The resulting pdf is used in Monte Carlo simulations to
   provide expected values in field variables such as concentration, and
   confidence limits. We compare the probabilistic results from a
   traditional advection-dispersion (ADE) model based on volumetric
   averaging concepts with that of a model based on the assumption that the
   hydraulic conductivity is a stationary stochastic process. The results
   suggest that although Naff's (1990) model satisfies the observed data to
   a better degree than ADE model, the upper and lower confidence bands
   about the mean value are larger than the ADE results. This result we
   attribute to the fact that Naff's (1990) model simply contains more
   parameters, each of which is unknown and has to be estimated. There is
   no statistical difference between the expected values of second-spatial
   moments for the two models. The examples presented in this paper
   illustrate problems associated with assigning Gaussian pdfs as priors in
   a probabilistic model. First, such an assumption for the input
   parameters actually injects more information into the problem than may
   actually exist, whether consciously or unconsciously. This fact is borne
   out by comparison with minimum relative entropy theory. Second, the
   output parameters as suggested from the Monte Carlo analysis cannot be
   assumed to be Gaussian distributed even when the prior pdf is Gaussian
   in form. In a practical setting, the significance of this result and the
   approximation of Gaussian form would depend on the toxicity and
   environmental standards that apply to the problem.}},

Abstract = {{To generate multidimensional Gaussian random fields over a regular
   sampling grid, hydrogeologists can call upon essentially two approaches.
   The first approach covers methods that are exact but computationally
   expensive, e.g., matrix factorization. The second covers methods that
   are approximate but that have only modest computational requirements,
   e.g., the spectral and turning bands methods. In this paper, we present
   a new approach that is both exact and computationally very efficient.
   The approach is based on embedding the random field correlation matrix R
   in a matrix S that has a circulant/block circulant structure. We then
   construct products of the square root S1/2 with white noise random
   vectors. Appropriate subvectors of this product have correlation matrix
   R, and so are realizations of the desired random field. The only
   conditions that must be satisfied for the method to be valid are that
   (1) the mesh of the sampling grid be rectangular, (2) the correlation
   function be invariant under translation, and (3) the embedding matrix S
   be nonnegative definite. These conditions are mild and turn out to be
   satisfied in most practical hydrogeological problems. Implementation of
   the method requires only knowledge of the desired correlation function.
   Furthermore, if the sampling grid is a d-dimensional rectangular mesh
   containing n points in total and the correlation between points on
   opposite sides of the rectangle is vanishingly small, the computational
   requirements are only those of a fast Fourier transform (FFT) of a
   vector of dimension 2(d)n per realization. Thus the cost of our approach
   is comparable with that of a spectral method also implemented using the
   FFT. In summary, the method is simple to understand, easy to implement,
   and is fast.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of seepage through hillsides is important to the
   understanding of landscape hydrology, run-off generation, erosion
   processes, and the transport of solutes. For complicated flow domains,
   numerical solutions have the propensity to be computationally expensive
   and inaccurate. Analytical solutions are therefore inherently valuable;
   they also provide a means of checking the accuracy of numerical
   solutions and, because they provide continuous velocity fields, are
   extremely useful in generating descriptions of solute transport. This
   paper presents a method for obtaining analytical solutions for seepage
   in the saturated zone of homogeneous hillsides with arbitrary surface
   geometry, using a least squares method to determine the coefficients in
   a series expansion of the Laplace equation. It determines the (initially
   unknown) water table location and accommodates arbitrary shapes of the
   lower impermeable boundary. Flow solutions for a variety of flow domain
   geometries are provided, with the upper and lower boundaries expressed
   as cubic splines and piecewise linear polynomials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a generalized two-dimensional analytical solute
   transport model with unidirectional flow field from time- and
   space-dependent sources in a bounded homogeneous medium using the
   flux-type (or third-type or Cauchy) boundary condition at the inlet
   location of the medium. The solute transport equation incorporates terms
   accounting for advection, dispersion, linear equilibrium sorption, and
   first-order decay. General solutions were determined for arbitrary input
   boundary conditions with the help of Fourier analysis and Laplace
   transform techniques. After presenting a generally applicable solution,
   special solutions are given for a single and two finite sources having
   different inlet solute flux distributions. The expressions for
   convective-dispersive flux components are also derived. Expressions for
   concentration distribution and convective-dispersive flux components for
   steady state transport case are also presented. Comparison of the
   results of this analytical model and a finite difference numerical model
   showed very good agreement. The solutions may be used for predicting
   solute concentrations in a unidirectional porous media flow field as
   well as in rivers and canals. The solutions may also be used for
   verification of more comprehensive numerical models, and laboratory or
   field determination of solute transport parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper continues the development of boundary integral equation
   technique for solving stochastic groundwater flow problems. The case of
   aquifers under deterministic hydraulic conductivity, but subject to
   random boundary condition and domain recharge has been investigated in

   equation. In the current paper the governing equation is transient, but

Abstract = {{From the perspective of water supply managers, supply reliability can be
   more important than economic benefit. This study uses four alternative
   models of water supply allocation to examine issues of reliability and
   welfare maximization arising from short-run inter-city water transfers.
   The results of this work show that the economic gain from water
   transfers may be relatively small. However, water transfers can
   significantly improve system reliability, thus providing strong
   incentives for transfer arrangements among water authorities. We apply
   the models in a case study on the island of Cyprus.}},

Abstract = {{The water supply system studied in this paper consists of a water
   treatment plant, a ground-level storage, a pumping station, and a
   distribution network in series. Expected served demand is employed to
   measure reliability taking into account both insufficient heads and
   flows at individual nodes in the network since it is the most important
   service level index provided to individual users. A basic method
   proposed is to assume that the insufficient nodal head reduces the
   effectiveness of flow supplied at the node and that the authority
   provides the maximum service to customers so that the real-time pump and
   network flow operations maximize the effective served system demand. The
   average value of the maximum effective served system demand relative to
   the total system demand over all system states is defined as system
   reliability, and the nodal reliability for each demand node is similarly
   defined. The Markov chain method introduced by Beim and Hobbs (1988) is
   employed to describe the evolution of the storage level over time so
   that the real-time pump and network flow operations can be accurately
   implemented by solving a nonlinear programming model. Two example
   systems are presented to demonstrate numerically the advantage of the
   method proposed in its consideration of the distribution network and
   nodal reliabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted in a 4-m-wide flume to simulate recirculating
   flow and sedimentation in a lateral eddy within a channel expansion. The
   percentage of main stem sediment that was captured by the eddy decreased
   from 37\% (when the eddy was empty) to 24\% (when sand filled
   approximately 32\% of the eddy volume). The reattachment bar within the
   eddy grew in an upstream direction, and the finest size sediment was
   deposited in the lee of the obstruction; both observations are
   consistent with field observations. Measurements of reattachment length
   during sediment transport (0.5-1.0 kg/s) at constant discharge (0.60
   m3/s) show that reattachment length depends not only on characteristics
   of the expanding jet, but also on the topography of the channel bed
   downstream; reattachment length decreased when part of the channel
   expansion was filled by an aggrading midchannel bar. Comparison of these
   results with measurements in the Colorado River in Grand Canyon suggests
   that downstream channel irregularities play a large role in controlling
   the length of eddies in natural rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Clay particles in drilling muds can form a filter cake (skin) on the
   walls of the well and migrate into the adjacent formation. In general,
   filter cakes are formed when a liquid phase containing solid particles
   is forced through a pervious surface which allows liquid transport,
   while retaining solid particles. Following a literature survey, the
   governing equations for the concentration of suspended solid particles
   in the pore fluid, cake permeability, and solid velocity are obtained by
   considering the mass balance equations for the fluid phase and suspended
   and captured solid particles. The capture mechanism is represented by a
   kinetic equation with rate constants for particle trapping and cake
   erosion. Numerical solutions for the cake permeability, cake resistance,
   solid particle velocity (cake compression rate), and concentration of
   suspended particles are obtained by utilizing experimentally available
   porosity and pressure variations along the dimensionless cake thickness.
   The results compared for a simplified experimental case, show excellent
   match. A sensitivity analysis shows that cake permeability and cake
   resistance are more sensitive to the rate constant of cake erosion than
   they are to the rate constant of particle capture. It was also
   determined that the permeability has larger values along the entire cake
   thickness when the rate constant of particle capture is zero in
   comparison to values obtained with a nonzero rate constant. Cake
   permeability is small when the rate constant of cake erosion is large.}},

   water development in developing countries. A significant number of the
   populations in developing countries do not have access to satisfactory
   water supplies. This problem is especially acute in the rural areas. The
   planning process has routinely failed to lead to successful projects.
   Often the projects do not pass the simplest of benefit-cost analyses.
   Further, the institutional framework that is developed for the
   administration of the projects is often flawed. The papers in this

Abstract = {{Water projects in less developed countries (LDCs) frequently are poorly
   operated and maintained. As a result, project benefits and development
   impacts fall short of plans. The problems begin in the project
   identification, design, and construction stages: donor and host country
   biases lead to inappropriate projects, unsustainable technologies, and
   shoddy construction. Later operation and maintenance are then difficult
   or impossible. Causal factors include donor desire to build monuments
   and sell technology, provision of excessive capital to favored sectors
   or institutions, and an unwillingness to require a reasonable quid pro
   quo from the host country. Host country factors include excessive
   administrative centralization, lack of rewards for good operation and
   maintenance, and widespread corruption in forms that seriously distort
   allocative efficiency. Until individual actors on both sides can be
   motivated to pursue the long-run good of the LDC, Third World water
   projects will continue to have low or negative net payoffs.}},

Abstract = {{In many parts of the developing world investment in water resources
   takes a large proportion of the available public investment funds. As
   the conflicts for funds between the water and other sectors become more
   severe the traditional ways of analyzing and planning water investments
   has to move way from project-by-project (or even a river basin-by-river
   basin) approaches to include the relationships of water investments to
   other sectors and to overall national development policies. Current
   approaches to water resources investments are too narrow. There is a
   need for ways to expand the strategic thinking of water sector managers.
   This paper develops a water resources planning methodology with the
   primary objective of giving insights into the linking of water sector
   investments and macroeconomic policies. The model optimizes the present
   value of investments for water resources development, while embedding a
   macroeconomic model into the framework to allow for an examination of
   the interactions between water investments, the growth in the
   agricultural sector, and the performance of the overall economy. A case
   study of Bangladesh is presented which shows how strategic thinking
   could lead to widely differing implications for water investments than
   would conventional water resources systems planning models.}},

Abstract = {{Crafting institutions related to the supply and use of irrigation
   systems require skills in understanding how rules, combined with
   particular physical, economic, and cultural environments, produce
   incentives and outcomes. If the users and suppliers of irrigation
   systems design their own institutional arrangements to cope with the
   physical, economic, social, and cultural features of each system, the
   variety of institutional arrangements could be immense. Examining
   specific rules of particular systems, however, is like focusing on
   specific blueprints of successful irrigation projects around the world.
   Recent theoretical and empirical work on institutional design has
   attempted to elucidate the core design principles used in long-enduring,
   self-organized irrigation institutions throughout the world. By `'design
   principle'' is meant a characteristic that helps to account for the
   success of these institutions in sustaining the physical works and
   gaining the compliance of generations of users to the rules in use. By
   `'long enduring'' is meant that the irrigation system has been in
   operation for at least several generations. Eight design principles
   identified in prior research are discussed and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Using data from a large representative sample of rural households in one
   region of the Philippines, we estimate the determinants of the rental
   value of dwellings using the bid-rent approach to the hedonic price
   model. Our particular interest is in the relative valuation these
   households place on owning a private source of water and distance to a
   public or communal source. We find that low-, middle-, and high-income
   households value an in-house piped water source highly relative to other
   characteristics of their homes. Middle- and high-income households value
   a deep well or piped water in the yard, although at a substantially
   lower level than piped water in the house. It is somewhat surprising to
   find that, except in the case of high-income families, households appear
   to gain little or no utility from having a communal source of water,
   such as a river, lake, or public tap, closer to their homes. As a
   consequence, public water policies that emphasize improving the quality
   and proximity of communal sources would be inappropriate for the region
   represented by this sample.}},

Abstract = {{Large quantities of financial and human resources have been devoted to
   improving rural water supplies in developing countries over the past two
   decades. Many projects have been successful, but many have failed to
   meet the needs of the intended beneficiaries. Evidence of the failures
   lies in the unused and poorly maintained systems that are scattered
   throughout rural areas of the developing world. The current situation in
   water supply in rural Kerala, India, reflects this general observation
   and can be described as a `'low-level equilibrium trap.'' Water systems
   provide a low level of service with few yard taps. The monthly tariff
   for water from household connections is low. With few connectors and low
   tariffs, little revenue is generated beyond subsidies provided by the
   government. The water authority can afford to maintain the system up to
   a level at which the reliability of service is low, forcing consumers to
   supplement piped water from traditional sources. This study analyzes
   contingent valuation data collected in three areas of Kerala to evaluate
   the possibility of lifting the system out of this trap. The analysis
   shows that by making a few critical policy changes, encouraging private
   connections and financing those connections through higher tariffs, the
   system can ratchet up to a `'high-level equilibrium'' in which there are
   many connectors, monthly revenues are greatly increased, and consumer
   welfare improves. Such a system would be better financed, making it
   possible to improve the reliability and quality of the service.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides an analysis of public policy relating to the rural
   water supply sector in the Punjab, Pakistan. Based on household survey
   data, it shows that rural water policies have not kept pace with the
   rapid economic development in this region and that in the absence of
   adequate public investment households find private sector alternatives
   to meet their water needs, often at high economic and environmental
   cost. Using the contingent valuation method for benefit estimation, it
   is also shown that household willingness to pay for reliable improved
   services is much higher than assumed. In fact, full cost recovery is
   quite feasible in many areas of the Punjab. It is recommended that rural
   water sector strategy be changed from a centralized, supply-oriented
   focus to a decentralized, demand-oriented policy.}},

Abstract = {{A framework is presented for the analysis of rent-extracting behavior by
   multiple agents involved in the provision of municipal water supplies in
   Jakarta, Indonesia. It is shown that such behavior can dramatically
   affect the terms and conditions under which water service is offered to
   the public. A water supply system based on limited numbers of public
   taps, relatively few house connections, and water vendors can generate
   substantial monopoly rents that can be appropriated by both public and
   private agents. Most professionals involved with water supply projects
   in developing countries typically assume that the objective of municipal
   water authorities is to serve the public interest. In fact, agents
   involved in the water delivery system may pursue strategies designed for
   private gain, which can have important and pervasive implications for
   how a water system is actually designed and operated. Proposals to
   change the technical, engineering aspects of a water distribution system
   can thus threaten the interests of powerful groups. Effective public
   policy and donor involvement in the water sector must be based on an
   understanding of the structure of water markets and the political power
   supporting existing institutional arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{Storing drinking water in the home is common in the developing world.
   Several studies have documented increased concentrations of fecal
   coliforms during household storage. This has led to the belief that
   in-house water contamination is an important transmission route for
   enteric pathogens and, moreover, that improving water source quality is
   not warranted until that quality can be maintained in the home. We
   contend that in-house water contamination does not pose a serious risk
   of diarrhea because family members would likely develop some level of
   immunity to pathogens commonly encountered in the household environment.
   Even when there is no such immunity, transmission of these pathogens via
   stored water may be inefficient relative to other household transmission
   routes, such as person-to-person contact or food contamination. A
   contaminated water source poses much more of a risk since it may
   introduce new pathogens into the household. The effects of water source
   and in-house contamination on diarrheal disease are estimated for 2355
   Filipino infants. The results confirm our hypothesis: contaminated water
   sources pose a serious risk of diarrhea while contamination of drinking
   water in the home does not. Water boiling is shown to eliminate the risk
   of diarrhea due to water source contamination. The results imply that
   improvements in water source quality are more important than improving
   water storage practices.}},

Abstract = {{Field and laboratory methods for estimating and interpreting parameters
   obtained from field borehole and laboratory core experiments are
   examined using permeability data interpreted from air and water
   injection tests in variably saturated fractured tuff at the Apache Leap
   Tuff Site in central Arizona. The tuff at the field site has a matrix
   porosity of approximately 17.5\% and contains numerous near-vertical
   fractures at an average spacing of 1.3 m. More than 270 m of
   6.4-cm-diameter oriented core were collected from boreholes drilled to a
   maximum depth below the surface of 30 m and at a vertical angle of
   45-degrees. Laboratory estimates of absolute permeabilities using air
   and water as the test fluids were acquired at a range of matric
   potentials for 105, 5-cm-long core segments extracted at approximately
   3-m intervals containing no obvious fractures. Field scale estimates of
   fractured rock permeabilities using air and water as test fluids were
   obtained at ambient matric suctions and water saturated conditions,
   respectively. The field tests were conducted along 3-m intervals within
   boreholes with the intervals centered on core sampling positions.
   Borehole and core permeabilities demonstrate substantial spatial
   variability, with variations exceeding three orders of magnitude.
   Laboratory core data show a strong relationship between permeabilities
   using saturated water and oven-dry air injection tests with the latter
   demonstrating the Klinkenberg effect. The influence of matric suction on
   permeabilities is used to demonstrate that relative permeabilities do
   not sum to a constant for a wide range of matric suction. Only weak
   relationships exist between permeabilities measured in boreholes versus
   cores for both water and air. Permeabilities measured in boreholes using
   air are shown to provide good estimates of permeabilities measured using
   water into initially unsaturated, fractured rock at the Apache Leap Tuff
   Site.}},

Abstract = {{Naturally transient flow (NTF) occurs when a groundwater regime fails to
   accommodate geologic changes. This paper describes a conspicuous NTF
   signature entirely within a low-permeability shale in an eroded basin.
   Flow in the shale appears to be a lagging hydrodynamic response to
   mechanical rebound and cooling from erosion; careful, long-term pressure
   measurements revealed a consistent pattern of low hydraulic head with
   the minimum within the shale. Available data are sufficient to rule out
   alternate causes of the pressure regime, and to construct a meaningful
   quantitative model of the effects of erosion. The shale behaves as a
   Kelvin substance in tests, but theoretical considerations suggest that
   its deformation during erosion mimics elastic behavior, permitting the
   model to be based on poroelasticity. Pressure patterns similar to that
   observed can be produced by incorporating into the model independent
   estimates of the shale's hydraulic, mechanical, and thermal properties
   and a reconstruction of the area's erosion history. The results confirm
   that local permeability is between 10(-21) and 10(-20) m2 (hydraulic
   conductivity between 10(-14) and 10(-13) m/s), in contrast to the higher
   regional permeability of 2 x 10(-16) m2 (hydraulic conductivity of 2 x
   10(-9) m/s) determined in an earlier study. Exploration techniques
   employed in this study could reveal similar NTF regimes in the future.}},

Abstract = {{A series of type curves is presented for estimating vertical groundwater
   flaxes in relatively shallow aquifers by using seasonal changes in

   estimated by fitting a dimensionless parameter to the type curves when
   the amplitude of annual variations of groundwater temperature at several
   depths and the thermal diffusivity of the aquifer are known or measured.
   Both upward and downward groundwater fluxes estimated by fitting
   temperatures observed in Nagaoka plain, Japan to the type curves agree
   well with the fluxes calculated from hydraulic conductivity and
   hydraulic gradient data. Measurements of seasonal changes in groundwater
   temperature and hydraulic gradients were analyzed to estimate the

Abstract = {{Theoretical calculations together with a review of data from Sweden,
   Switzerland and Canada indicate that given sufficient isolation time and
   U and Th in the aquifer matrix, deep subsurface production of H-3, He-4,
   Cl-36, Ar-37, Ar-39, Ar-40, Kr-85, I-129, and Rn-222 can overshadow the
   normal atmospheric component of these nuclides in recharging
   groundwater. Although direct evidence is lacking, calculations suggest
   that small but measurable subsurface production  of H-3 and C-14 could
   also take place in aquifers having high U and Th concentrations. Some
   groundwater which has been recharged during the past 40 years will have
   H-3, He-3, Cl-36, Kr-85, and I-129 concentrations which are dominantly
   anthropogenic. Dating methods with the least complications in
   interpretation appear to be H-3-He-3 for postbomb waters and Kr-81 for
   waters in the range of 5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) a.}},

Abstract = {{Springwater samples were collected at Aguas da Prata, an important spa
   in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The U-238 and U-234 isotopes were evaluated
   for Platina, Paiol, Villela, Prata-Radioativa, Prata-Nova, Boi, Vitoria,
   and Prata-Antiga springs. An inverse logarithmic correlation was found
   between U-234/U-238 activity ratio and Rn-222 content of the studied
   waters, which was related to different solution mechanisms of Rn-222 and
   U-234 nuclides at the rock-water interface. A linear correlation also
   exists between the U-234/U-238 activity ratios of the studied waters and
   total dissolved solids, ionic strength, CO2 partial pressure, and index
   of base exchange, which indicates that the enhancement of U-234 in
   solution increases with the degree of weathering in the aquifers, A
   higher U-234/U-238 activity ratio was found to be directly related to a
   higher value of dissolution rate.}},

Abstract = {{A Bayesian decision framework is developed for addressing questions of
   hydrogeological data worth associated with engineering design at sites
   in heterogeneous geological environments. The specific case investigated
   is one of remedial contaminant containment in an aquifer underlain by an
   aquitard of uncertain continuity. The framework is used to evaluate the
   worth of hard and soft data in investigating the aquitard's continuity.
   The analysis consists of four modules: (1) an aquitard realization
   generator based on indicator kriging, (2) a procedure for the Bayesian
   updating of the uncertainty with respect to aquitard windows, (3) a
   Monte Carlo simulation model for advective contaminant transport, and
   (4) an economic decision model. A sensitivity analysis for a generic
   design example involving a design decision between a no-action
   alternative and a containment alternative indicates that the data worth
   of a single borehole providing a hard point datum was more sensitive to
   economic parameters than to hydrogeological or geostatistical
   parameters. For this case, data worth is very sensitive to the projected
   cost of containment, the discount rate, and the estimated cost of
   failure. When it comes to hydrogeological parameters, such as the
   representative hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard or underlying
   aquifer, the sensitivity analysis indicates that it is more important to
   know whether the field value is above or below some threshold value than
   it is to know its actual numerical value. A good conceptual
   understanding of the site geology is important in estimating prior
   uncertainties. The framework was applied in a retrospective fashion to
   the design of a remediation program for soil contaminated by radioactive
   waste disposal at the Savannah River site in South Carolina. The
   cost-effectiveness of different patterns of boreholes was studied. A
   contour map is presented for the net expected value of sample
   information (EVSI) for a single borehole. The net EVSI of patterns of
   precise point measurements is also compared to that of an imprecise
   seismic survey.}},

Abstract = {{The mobility and ecology of viruses in natural environments is strongly
   influenced by the adsorption of virus particles to sand or soil
   surfaces. This binding process is frequently studied by conducting batch
   experiments in which fluid suspensions of virus particles are contacted
   with the adsorbent of interest. In this report, a simple first-order
   kinetic theory is presented which accounts for many of the complicated
   interactions that can occur when viruses contact an adsorbent in a batch
   system. Closed-form solutions and numerical simulations of the model
   indicate that four classes of virus-surface interactions can be
   identified, including quasi-equilibrium adsorption, quasi-equilibrium
   adsorption with surface sinks, quasi-equilibrium adsorption with reduced
   inactivation, and direct irreversible adsorption. Based on these
   results, a new experimental approach for studying virus-surface
   interactions is proposed and tested using a model system consisting of
   bacteriophage lambda and Ottawa sand. Fluid samples were collected from
   sand-containing and sand-free virus suspensions over the course of 5-6
   days and analyzed for plaque forming units (PFU). These experiments were
   repeated using three different pH values and six different electrolyte
   compositions. Nondimensionalization of the PFU data from the sand-free
   suspension collapsed all of the data onto a single fine, as predicted by
   the kinetic model. When plotted in a nondimensional format, data from
   the sand-containing suspensions exhibited behavior which could readily
   be interpreted within the context of the kinetic model. These results
   suggest that the proposed approach offers a powerful alternative to
   conventional methods for studying virus adsorption at the solid-liquid
   interface, and for predicting the potential mobility and fate of viruses
   in porous media.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the procedures used in common methods for field
   measurement of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in heterogeneous soil
   were simulated through numerical experiments. It was assumed that the
   heterogeneity of the field soil can be described by a scaling factor 8
   which is treated as a lognormally distributed, second-order stationary
   random variable in space. After the hypothetical random field was
   generated using property variability and correlation length scales
   typical of those observed in field measurements, it was used to test
   various field measurement methods currently in practice. One detailed
   and three simplified unsteady drainage flux methods were used to
   estimate the hydraulic conductivity under plausible field measurement
   conditions. In addition, the soil water retention data were used to
   predict hydraulic conductivity from a pore-size distribution model. It
   was found that even under the assumption that there were no reading or
   instrument errors, other sources of errors can still be created due to
   the limitations of the observation techniques. These error sources
   include limited number of readings in space and time, separation
   distances between the readings of water content and pressure head, and
   volume-averaged readings rather than point estimates with common
   instrumentation. Under the conditions studied in the simulations, the
   detailed method of estimation produced reasonable estimates of hydraulic
   conductivity, but only when very dense measurements of water content and
   matric potential were used in the estimation. None of the approximate
   methods yielded accurate measurements of the true hydraulic conductivity
   of the field region measured.}},

Abstract = {{Flow in fractures is traditionally modeled by characterizing the
   aperture distribution with some deterministic function or set of
   stochastic parameters. Other models generate the aperture distribution
   by the closure of two stochastic surfaces. The objective of this
   research is to develop a model where the aperture distribution is
   determined during the closure of two random elastic surfaces with
   complete hydromechanical interaction. Because stress and strain
   conditions required to generate a given aperture distribution are
   calculated during closure, the model is used to couple the mechanical
   and hydraulic characteristics of the fracture. Stochastic realizations
   of clay fracture surfaces are generated by measuring one-dimensional
   profiles of a fracture surface. Next, the spectral representation of the
   profile is related to the fractal dimension of the fracture, Using the
   fractal dimension determined from one-dimensional clay profiles, an
   equivalent two-dimensional fractal surface is generated. Conceptually,
   each surface consists of linear elastic rectangular asperities resting
   upon a linear elastic half-space. During closure, asperities that come
   into contact deform and punch into the half space creating mechanical
   interaction between all the asperities on the grid. Once we determine
   the aperture distribution at an applied stress level, a hydraulic
   gradient is applied across the fracture and fluid flow is determined.
   Nodal pressures created by flow deform the aperture distribution
   coupling hydraulic to mechanical behavior. Stress versus relative
   closure results indicate that stress increases nonlinearly with relative
   closure. Fluid pressures in the aperture distribution exert a
   significant influence on the mechanical characteristics of a fracture.
   Fluid discharge through the fracture decreases exponentially with an
   increase in relative closure. Flow calculated in the rough walled
   aperture distribution deviates increasingly from the parallel plate
   model with the geometric mean aperture as the percent contact area
   increases. The deviation results from an increase in tortuosity and
   channelling of the flow field in the aperture distribution. We can use
   this model to develop stress and flow versus relative closure
   constitutive relationships for a single fracture as a function of
   fracture surface geometry.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a geostatistical method, known as factorial kriging
   analysis, which is well suited for analyzing multivariate spatial
   information. The method involves multivariate variogram modeling,
   principal component analysis, and cokriging. It uses several separate
   correlation structures, each corresponding to a specific spatial scale,
   and yields a set of regionalized factors summarizing the main features
   of the data for each spatial scale. The method is applied to springwater
   solute contents (Ca, Sr, Mg, K, Na, SO4, NO3 Cl, pH, electrical
   conductivity, alkalinity) measured in 86 springs situated in the Dyle
   River catchment area, Belgium. Two scales of spatial variation (1 and 9
   km) are identified and interpreted. These correspond to local sources of
   contaminants due to human activities and regional changes in the
   geologic characteristics of the aquifer. At each scale, the correlation
   structure is analyzed and the regionalized factors are estimated by
   cokriging and then mapped. The results are compared with those of a
   classical multivariate approach, i.e., principal component analysis of
   the correlation matrix, which takes no account of the spatial location
   of the observations.}},

Abstract = {{A new dual-porosity model is developed for single-phase fluid flow in
   fractured/porous media. Flow is assumed to take place through the
   fracture network and between the fractures and matrix blocks. The matrix
   blocks are treated in a lumped parameter manner, with a single average
   pressure used for each matrix block. Rather than assuming that
   fracture/matrix flux is proportional to the difference between the
   fracture pressure and matrix pressure at each point, as is done in the
   Warren-Root model, we use a nonlinear equation which more accurately
   models the flux over all time regimes, including both early and late
   times. This flux equation is compared with analytical solutions for
   spherical blocks with prescribed pressure variations on their
   boundaries. The nonlinear flux equation is also used as a source/sink
   term in the numerical simulator TOUGH. The modified code allows more
   accurate simulations than the conventional Warren-Root method, with a
   large savings (about 90\%) in computational time compared to methods
   which explicitly discretize the matrix blocks.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional groundwater management model is developed for a
   shallow, unconfined sandy aquifer at a Superfund site at which a vinyl
   chloride plume is migrating toward Lake Michigan. We use nonlinear
   simulation-regression applied to a transient groundwater flow model to
   estimate parameter values and their uncertainties and use steady state
   flow path analyses to confirm the model's consistency with the location
   of contaminants. Parameter uncertainty is translated into flow model
   prediction uncertainty using a first-order Taylor series approximation.
   Optimal minimum-pumping strategies for steady state hydraulic
   containment of the plume are designed, and model prediction uncertainty
   is accounted for with stochastic programming. It is impossible to
   achieve a reliability level higher than 60\% using only two pumping
   wells. For the 10-well case, pumping rates must increase about 40\% to
   extend reliability from 50 to 90\%. Monte Carlo analyses indicate that
   for the 10-well 90\% reliability formulation, the first-order method of
   propagating uncertainty results in a solution with accurate performance
   reliabilities. We find that the coefficient of variation in hydraulic
   gradient dictates whether the probabilistic constraints are obeyed.
   Comparison of the probabilistic constraint and `'safety factor''
   approaches to overcoming model uncertainty reveals that the ability of
   probabilistic constraints to accommodate local variations in model
   prediction uncertainty is highly important. Postoptimization solute
   transport studies show that increased reliability levels for hydraulic
   containment do not necessarily translate into faster plume cleanup
   times.}},

Abstract = {{This study of the effect of excess rainfall, ponded without runoff, on
   the dynamics of infiltration into a deep homogeneous soil uses the
   Green-Ampt, or delta function, approximation. Exact solutions are given
   for constant and for piecewise constant rainfall. An inverse method
   yields solutions for arbitrary hyetographs. Ponding can increase
   markedly both the total duration of the infiltration event and the total
   amount infiltrated. The analysis suggests that capillary hysteresis
   emerges during the ponding recession phase toward the end of a storm. In
   long-duration heavy rainstorms infiltration rate may increase with time,
   contrary to the classical picture. The asymptotic large time
   infiltration rate under continuous constant rainfall at rate R, with R
   greater-than-or-equal-to KBAR (the conductivity parameter in the
   Green-Ampt formulation) is an increasing function of both KBAR and R.
   (With ponding neglected, it is simply KBAR). An appendix gives some
   exact results on the influence of hyetograph shape on time to ponding.}},

   TRANSPORT WITH 1ST-ORDER DECAY AND ZERO-ORDER PRODUCTION}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport in the subsurface is often considered to be a
   nonequilibrium process. Predictive models for nonequilibrium transport
   may be based either on chemical considerations by assuming the presence
   of a kinetic sorption process, or on physical considerations by assuming
   two-region (dual-porosity) type formulations which partition the liquid
   phase into mobile and immobile regions. For certain simplifying
   conditions, including steady state flow and linear sorption, the
   chemical and physical nonequilibrium transport models can be cast in the
   same dimensionless form. This paper presents a comprehensive set of
   analytical solutions for one-dimensional nonequilibrium solute transport
   through semi-infinite soil systems. The models involve the one-site,
   two-site, and two-region transport models, and include provisions for
   first-order decay and zero-order production. General solutions are
   derived for the volume-averaged (or resident) solute concentration using
   Laplace transforms assuming both first- and third-type inlet conditions,
   and arbitrary initial conditions, input solute concentrations, and
   solute production profiles. The solutions extend and generalize existing
   solutions for equilibrium and nonequilibrium solute transport. The
   general solutions are evaluated for some commonly used input and initial
   conditions, and zero-order production profiles. Expressions for the
   flux-averaged concentration are derived from the general and specific
   solutions assuming a third-type inlet condition. Typical examples of
   calculated concentration distributions resulting from several sets of
   initial and input conditions and zero-order production functions are
   also presented and briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dry water repellent soils are difficult to wet, forcing water and
   solutes to flow via preferential paths through the unsaturated zone. A
   tracer field experiment was used to investigate the mechanism of
   preferential flow and transport in a water repellent sandy soit. Water
   and solutes are distributed by lateral flow within the, relatively wet,
   thin humose topsoil toward preferential flow paths below this zone. This
   flow in the upper layer, which is of major importance in the spatial
   distribution of water and solutes in field soils, is generally not
   considered, and is introduced here as `'distribution flow.'' The
   preferential flow paths are separated by dry soil bodies, which are
   highly persistent due to their extremely water repellent character and
   their low hydraulic conductivity. In the wettable zone, below 45 cm
   depth, water and solutes diverge toward areas below dry soil bodies.
   Despite this process, the spatial variation in solute concentrations in
   this zone remained relatively high.}},

Abstract = {{The recent literature contains conflicting claims about the
   characteristics of attached bacteria in subsurface porous media and how
   these characteristics affect permeability reduction. Some claim that the
   bacteria form continuous biofilms that restrict the pore size, while
   others claim that bacteria are attached in patchy aggregates that
   accumulate in pore throats. This contribution applies a recently
   developed tool from biofilm kinetics, the normalized surface loading, to
   interpret a wide range of experimental data from porous media
   experiments and biological filtration. The normalized surface loading is
   the actual substrate flux (i.e., rate of removal per unit surface area)
   divided by the minimum flux capable of supporting a deep biofilm. The
   analyses show that biofilms are continuous for normalized surface
   loadings greater than 1.0, but appear to become discontinuous for values
   less than about 0.25. For the low-load situation, distinguishing between
   continuous and discontinuous biofilms is not important when the modeling
   goal is prediction of substrate removal. However, the distinction is
   more critical when the modeling goal is to describe the spatial
   distribution of attached biomass and permeability loss.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional numerical model is presented for simulating the
   enhanced biorestoration of aquifer material contaminated with residual
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) hydrocarbon. The model simulates the
   simultaneous dissolution, transport, and biodegradation of individual
   hydrocarbons under oxygen-limiting conditions. Partitioning between the
   NAPL and aqueous phase is modeled as a linear first-order process where
   the NAPL is composed of two fractions, a fast oil fraction with a high
   mass transfer rate and a slow oil fraction with a much lower mass
   transfer rate. Microorganisms are assumed to be present attached to the
   soil grains and are assumed to be immobile. Biodegradation of the
   problem compounds is simulated as a multistep process where the parent
   compounds are first biotransformed to oxygenated intermediates. These
   intermediates may then be mineralized to CO2 and H2O. Comparison of
   model simulations with experimental results from soil columns containing
   residual hydrocarbon and an active microbial population indicate that
   the model is capable of simulating the extent of hydrocarbon
   biodegradation using reasonable model parameters. Model simulations
   indicate that if benzene, toluene, and xylene are assumed to be
   completely mineralized, the model will greatly underestimate the extent
   of biotransformation. The model overestimated the extent of hydrocarbon
   biotransformation at low substrate concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal particles or dissolved organic matter (DOM) can act as
   carriers to enhance the transport of contaminants in groundwater by
   reducing retardation effects. When either of these materials is present,
   the system can be treated as consisting of three phases: an aqueous
   phase, a carrier phase, and the stationary solid matrix phase. The
   contaminant may be present in either or all of these phases. In the work
   reported, a mathematical model was developed to describe the transport
   and fate of the contaminant and carrier material in a porous medium. The
   model is based on mass balance equations describing the transport and
   fate of the contaminant and carrier in a three-phase medium.
   Colloid/contaminant and colloid/matrix mass transfer mechanisms are
   represented by first-order kinetics. Equilibrium partitioning of DOM
   acting as a carrier of the contaminant introduces a significant
   simplification in the model formulation, For a constant DOM
   concentration a much smaller retardation coefficient can be obtained in
   the three-phase system than the coefficient obtained in a conventional
   advective/dispersive transport equation for a two-phase system. The
   modified retardation coefficient reflects the presence of the mobile
   carrier by incorporating both the sorption of the contaminant and
   capture of the carrier on the solid matrix. Numerical solutions for the
   model were obtained by using a finite difference scheme to provide
   estimates of contaminant and carrier concentrations. Significant
   sensitivities to model parameters, particularly the rate constants of
   carrier capture and sorption were discovered. The numerical results of
   the DOM carrier effect matched favorably with experimental data reported
   in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The rate at which contaminants in groundwater undergo sorption and
   desorption is routinely described using diffusion models. Such
   approaches, when incorporated into transport models, lead to large
   systems of coupled equations, often nonlinear. This has restricted
   applications of coupled transport and diffusion models to
   one-dimensional systems. Further, numerical difficulties inherent in
   many common solution formulations to coupled transport and diffusion
   problems result in inaccurate and unreliable solutions to problems of
   common interest. The objective of this work was to develop methods that
   provide accurate and robust solutions to coupled transport and diffusion
   problems for single and multicomponent solute systems in both one and
   two spatial dimensions. Problems involving pore, surface, and combined
   pore and surface diffusion into spherical particles are considered. A
   split-operator formulation is proposed in which the reaction operator is
   separated from the transport operator and solved independently. Models
   derived from such split-operator formulations to selected coupled
   transport and diffusion problems are shown to be robust, accurate, and
   computationally efficient. The developed split-operator approaches are
   also amenable to solution using parallel, or for some problems massively
   parallel, processing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical contamination of groundwater is typically associated with
   multicomponent solutions, the migration of which is affected by
   preferential adsorption and solution reactions. Transport models should,
   therefore, account for advection and dispersion and for the reactions in
   the solution and on the solid phase. The two-dimensional model METLI has
   been developed for the personal computer (PC) simulation of groundwater
   transport with competitive adsorption of a three-species system
   consisting of a metal, a ligand, and their dominant complex at a given
   pH. The model structure, which employs spatial and process splitting
   algorithms, is described. One- and two-dimensional application examples
   are used to demonstrate how chemical reactivity and affinity for
   adsorption of a species, adsorption capacity of soil, and the number of
   the adsorbing species affect pollutant plumes in groundwater. The model
   executes rapidly on PCs using grids of several hundred nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Bouldery, mountain streams often possess highly irregular banks and beds
   composed of bedrock outcrops and immobile clasts mingled with alluvial
   bed forms. This complex morphology can induce locally strong flow
   accelerations and distortions of the water surface. Despite the
   complexity of flow at a scale of one or two channel widths and smaller,
   it is possible to identify a filament of high streamwise velocity that
   exhibits a near-oscillatory structure, albeit noisy, as it threads back
   and forth across the channel over tens of channel widths; and transverse
   water surface slopes locally mimic transverse bed slopes. These features
   are responses to shoaling of flow over an irregular, nearly random, bed
   topography. To clarify the mechanisms leading to this structure,
   linearized forms of the depth-averaged equations of momentum and
   continuity are solved in the wavenumber domain, for the case of a
   straight channel with uniform width, using a doubly periodic description
   of bed topography as a forcing term. Systematic changes in the strength
   and phase of velocity and water surface responses with varying
   wavenumber of bed undulations reflect mutual interaction of streamwise
   and transverse flow accelerations and transverse water surface slopes.
   These results are cast in terms of spectral responses to a bed composed
   of many superimposed waveforms. Then the shapes of spectra describing
   transverse water surface slopes and the transverse coordinate of the
   high-velocity filament, as measured from 100 equally spaced sections
   along North Boulder Creek, Colorado, are predicted by the analysis. The
   levels of the spectra are underestimated, however, due to factors not
   taken into account by the linear analysis, notably variations in width,
   and form drag associated with coarse roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Salmonids (salmon and trout) winnow fine sediment from streambed gravels
   during construction of the nest or `'redd'' used for spawning and
   incubation of fertilized eggs. The gravels and interstitial fine
   sediments excavated during this process are exposed to currents and
   differentially transported: gravels move a short distance, while the
   fine sediments are swept further downstream from the redd. To quantify
   the resultant modification of particle size distributions in redds, we
   sampled redds and adjacent undisturbed gravels to document changes in
   size distributions. These data were compiled with previously published
   observations to analyze the general nature of size modification during
   spawning. The final percentage finer than 1 mm in the gravels, P1f, is
   related to the initial percentage finer than 1 mm, P1i, by the equation
   P1f = 0.63 P1i. Hydraulic variables (water surface slope, mean column
   velocity, depth, shear stress, unit stream power) explained little of
   the variance and did not appear in the optimal models. Because fisheries
   biologists are called upon to evaluate gravels as potential spawning
   sites, these findings should prove useful in such evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of suitably sized spawning gravels limits salmonid
   (salmon and trout) populations in many streams. We compiled published
   and original size distribution data to determine distinguishing
   characteristics of spawning gravels and how gravel size varies with size
   of the spawning fish. Median diameters of 135 size distributions ranged
   from 5.4 to 78 mm, with 50\% falling between 14.5 and 35 mm. All but
   three spawning gravel size distributions were negatively skewed (on a
   log-transformed basis), with 50\% of the skewness coefficients falling
   between -0.24 and -0.39. Fewer than 20\% of the distributions were
   bimodal. Although tending to be coarser, spawning gravels had sorting
   and skewness values similar to other fluvial gravels reported in the
   literature. The range of gravel sizes used by fish of a given species or
   length is great, but the relation between fish size and size of gravel
   can be described by an envelope curve. In general, fish can spawn in
   gravels with a median diameter up to about 10\% of their body length.}},

Abstract = {{The existence of an upper limit to the magnitude of floods in a region
   is a long-standing and controversial hypothesis in flood hydrology.
   Regional envelope curves encompassing maximum flood magnitudes stabilize
   with progressive increases in the areal coverage and period of
   observation (Wolman and Costa, 1984). However, the short lengths of
   conventional gaging records limit substantial advances in testing
   whether this stabilization is evidence of an upper limit. In the
   Colorado River basin there are 32,120 station years of pge data, but the
   average period at a gaging station is only 20 years, with most stations
   having less than 70 years of observation. Paleoflood magnitudes derived
   from sediments of large prehistoric floods from 25 sites on rivers in
   Arizona and Utah provide additional data to extend the records of the
   largest floods. The paleoflood data identify the maximum flood
   discharges that have occurred on individual rivers over the last several
   hundred to several thousand years. Even with this increase in the
   observational period, the largest paleoflood discharges do not exceed
   the upper bound of maximum peak discharges delineated by the envelope
   curve derived from the available gaged and historical records. This
   result accords with the hypothesis of an upper physical limit for flood
   magnitudes and suggests that, for the Colorado River basin, the upper
   limit can be approximated by existing systematic and historical data for
   large floods. Similar relationships also hold when paleofloods and gaged
   records are presented for the subregion of southern Arizona.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model based on a finite difference solution of the unsteady
   heat advection-dispersion equation is formulated to predict water
   temperatures in streams at time increments of 1 hour. An energy balance
   accounts for the effects of air temperature, solar radiation, relative
   humidity, cloud cover, and wind speed on the net rate of heat exchange
   through the water surface, and heat conduction between water and
   streambed. Continuous stream temperature recordings in shallow streams
   show strong dynamic behavior including diurnal variations of several
   degrees Celsius which are lost in the standard daily records. These
   measured water temperatures are used to calibrate the model for the
   optimum percentages of Sun shading and wind sheltering. Stream exposure
   to solar radiation is shown to vary from 30 to 100\% and wind exposure
   from 10 to 30\% depending on the character of the stream. Values are
   related to stream width and season because of variable leaf cover of
   trees on stream banks. After calibration, accuracies of hourly and daily
   water temperature predictions over periods of several weeks are of the
   order of 0.2-degrees to 1-degrees-C. Solar (shortwave) radiation is
   shown to be the most important component of the heat flux across the
   stream water surface, but none of the other components, i.e., long-wave
   radiation, evaporation, and convection to the atmosphere, are
   negligible. Conductive heat exchange between the streambed and the water
   is a significant heat balance component in shallow streams.}},

Abstract = {{Theory is developed for hillslope drainage and is applied to the
   condition of sudden drawdown at the aquifer outlet. The equations for
   prediction of cumulative outflow volume, flow rate, and water table
   profile are based on the Boussinesq approximation for subsurface water
   flow above a sloping impermeable. layer. The advantages of the theory
   presented here am that the assumption of a long, thin aquifer is
   unnecessary; the same equations apply to both sloping and horizontal
   aquifers; and the equations contain only parameters that are easily
   measured or estimated: slope, drainable porosity, saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, and layer thickness. The accuracy of the outflow equations
   is illustrated by a series of laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The percolation of water through snow is shown to be detectable with
   heat flux transducers (HFTs) at the base of, or embedded within, the
   snow. Theory indicates that the arrival of water at a HFT will result in
   a rapid drop in heat flow to negative values, followed by an exponential
   rise. Laboratory and field tests verify that the theory correctly
   predicts the form of the signal, and consideration of conditions in a
   snow cover suggest that it is unlikely the signal can be generated in
   any other way. Large (15 x 15 cm) HFTs were installed at the snow/ground
   interface at three locations in Alaska where rain on snow is common.
   During three winters, heat flux signals indicative of water percolating
   to the base of the snow were detected 23 times, often simultaneously at
   two or more sites. All signals were coincident with rain-on-snow events,
   though not all rain-on-snow events (there were a total of 27) were
   associated with distinctive heat flux signals. Signals were observed
   only when rainfall rates exceeded 1.5 cm d-1, and the character of the
   signal differed if the snow/ground interface was at or lower than
   0-degrees-C. Observed delays between the start of rain and the arrival
   of water at the base of the snow ranged between 2 and 40 hours. A
   geometric analysis was used to calculate the spacing of percolation
   fingers or columns necessary to produce the observed number of times
   that water percolated onto the HFTs. The number of times there were
   abrupt changes in the temperature of thermistors installed in the snow
   adjacent to the HFTs was used in a similar manner. Results from both
   analyses suggest percolation columns with a mean spacing of about 25 cm,
   which is consistent with observations of these features in snow
   trenches.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical evidence suggests that statistical properties of storm
   rainfall at a location and within a homogeneous season have a
   well-structured dependence on storm duration. To explain this
   dependence, a simple scaling model for rainfall intensity within a storm
   was hypothesized. It was shown both analytically and empirically that
   such a model can explain reasonably well the observed statistical
   structure in the interior of storms, thus providing an efficient
   parametrization of storms of varying durations and total depths. This
   simple scaling model is also consistent with, and provides a theoretical
   basis for, the concept of mass curves (normalized cumulative storm depth
   versus normalized cumulative time since the beginning of a storm) which
   are extensively used in hydrologic design. In contrast, popular
   stationary models of rainfall intensity are shown unable to capture the
   duration dependent statistical structure of storm depths and are also
   inconsistent with the concept of mass curves.}},

Abstract = {{A very simple statistical model is proposed to describe the time
   distribution of rainfall within a rainy event. The modeled process is
   the dimensionless hyetograph H(t(j)) that represents the fraction of
   rainfall accumulated over the time interval (0, t(j)), where t(j) is a
   fraction of the total duration. In any rainy episode lasting n + 1 units
   of time, the sequence H(t1), ..., H(t(n)) is described as an ordered
   sample from the beta distribution. Dimensionless rainfall from hourly
   data at three stations in Southern Spain show little dependence on
   rainfall duration, amount of precipitation, or period of the year. These
   results, though not essential to the model structure, simplify its
   formulation, reducing the number of parameters. Other features of the
   historical records, such as correlations, maximum dimensionless hourly
   precipitation, or frequency curves, are reasonably well reproduced by
   the model.}},

Abstract = {{Many climatologists predict major changes in the earth's climate due to
   an expected doubling of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Global circulation
   models have been used to derive alternate climate scenarios under such
   conditions and the effects on water resources have been estimated with
   hydrological models. The hydrological models have generally assumed that
   the watershed itself would remain unchanged. However, it is more likely
   that a changing climate would alter the distribution and the
   transpiration efficiency of vegetation types within a watershed. A new
   hydrological model in which the parameters are based on land use class
   (effectively, vegetation type) was calibrated and verified for a
   watershed in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia. The changes in
   land use associated with a doubled carbon dioxide scenario were
   estimated, and the model was rerun incorporating the changed climate and
   the changed land use. Details of the effects of this scenario on the
   hydrology of the watershed are given, but it is emphasized that the
   purpose of the paper is to develop the methodology and not to endorse
   any particular scenario of climatic change.}},

Title = {{CROSS-CORRELATED RANDOM-FIELD GENERATION WITH THE DIRECT

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computer algorithm that is capable of cogenerating
   pairs of three-dimensional, cross-correlated random fields. The
   algorithm produces random fields of real variables by the inverse
   Fourier transform of a randomized, discrete three-dimensional spectral
   representations of the variables. The randomization is done in the
   spectral domain in a way that preserves the direct power and
   cross-spectral density structure. Two types of cross spectra were
   examined. One type specifies a linear relationship between the two
   fields, which produces the same correlation scales for both variables
   but different variances. The second cross spectrum is obtained from a
   specified transfer function and the two power spectra, and it produces
   fields with different correlation scales. For both models the degree of
   correlation is specified by the coherency. A delay vector can also be
   specified to produce an out-of-phase correlation between the two fields.
   The algorithm is very efficient computationally, is relatively easy to
   use, and does not produce the lineation problems that can be encountered
   with the turning bands method. Perhaps most important, this random field
   generator is capable of co-generating cross-correlated random fields.}},

Abstract = {{A new mass-conservative method for solution of the one-dimensional
   advection-dispersion equation is derived and discussed. Test results
   demonstrate that the finite-volume Eulerian-Lagrangian localized adjoint
   method (FVELLAM) outperforms standard finite-difference methods, in
   terms of accuracy and efficiency, for solute transport problems that are
   dominated by advection. For dispersion-dominated problems, the
   performance of the method is similar to that of standard methods. Like
   previous ELLAM formulations, FVELLAM systematically conserves mass
   globally with all types of boundary conditions. FVELLAM differs from
   other ELLAM approaches in that integrated finite differences, instead of
   finite elements, are used to approximate the governing equation. This
   approach, in conjunction with a forward tracking scheme, greatly
   facilitates mass conservation. The mass storage integral is numerically
   evaluated at the current time level, and quadrature points are then
   tracked forward in time to the next level. Forward tracking permits
   straightforward treatment of inflow boundaries, thus avoiding the
   inherent problem in backtracking, as used by most characteristic
   methods, of characteristic lines intersecting inflow boundaries. FVELLAM
   extends previous ELLAM results by obtaining mass conservation locally on
   Lagrangian space-time elements. Details of the integration, tracking,
   and boundary algorithms are presented. Test results are given for
   problems in Cartesian and radial coordinates.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the problem of programming the optimal operation of an
   aquifer system hydraulically linked to a river, using a set of
   predesigned hydraulic structures, in order to meet agricultural
   requirements. The focus is on two fundamental aspects: (1) the choice of
   a model that adequately reflects the physical, dynamic behavior of such
   a system and possesses characteristics allowing for the treatment of the
   problem through optimization techniques, and (2) the formulation of the
   problem as an optimization program. The model includes a physical
   component, based on the influence coefficient (impulsional response)
   concept and the principle of superposition, and an agricultural
   production function, elaborated in such a way as to reflect the dynamic
   process of plant development, that is, the seasonal life cycle of the
   crops and the effect of changing hydrological conditions on the latter.
   Results obtained on a test scenario illustrate the approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach to streamflow forecasting, based on a
   Markov chain model for estimating the probabilities that the one-step
   ahead streamflow forecast will be within specified flow ranges. With the
   new approach, flood forecasting is possible by focusing on a preselected
   range of streamflows. In addition, the approach introduces a
   multiobjective (two-criterion) function for the assessment of model
   performance. The two criteria are (1) the probability of issuing a false
   alarm and (2) the probability of failing to predict a flood event. The
   goal is to minimize both criteria simultaneously. Three versions of the
   model are presented: a first-order Markov chain model, a second-order
   Markov chain model, and a first-order Markov chain with rainfall as
   exogenous input model. These models compared favorably to time series
   models, using data from two watersheds (a semiarid watershed and a
   temperate watershed), when evaluated in terms of the multiobjective
   performance criterion.}},

Title = {{GLOBAL OPTIMUM TREE SOLUTION FOR SINGLE-SOURCE LOOPED WATER DISTRIBUTION
   NETWORKS SUBJECTED TO A SINGLE LOADING PATTERN}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{A methodology, based on linear programming (LP) is developed for
   obtaining the global optimum tree solution for single-source looped
   water distribution networks (WDNs) subjected to a single loading
   pattern. Initially, a multiple-link loop is considered, and it is shown
   that the cost-discharge curve is concavoconvex: convex for local minima
   corresponding to trees and concave for discharges in between. The logic
   is then extended to P loop networks for which the cost-discharge surface
   is a (P + 1)-dimensional hypersurface. A tree of the looped WDN is
   initially selected, optimized by LP, and successively modified,
   considering one loop at a time, so that the solution jumps on the
   hypersurface, from one local minimum to a better one. The procedure is
   continued until no further improvement in local optimum solution occurs;
   thus the final solution is the global optimum tree solution. The
   optimization procedure is illustrated through a one-source, 31-demand
   node, three-loop WDN, for which only 23 trees, out of possible 1048
   trees, were required to be optimized for obtaining the global optimum
   tree solution. Since each link had to carry a minimum specified flow,
   one more iteration was carried out in the end to satisfy the
   minimum-flow constraint. Even though the tree solution is global
   optimum, the final solution satisfying the minimum-flow constraint
   cannot be claimed to be necessarily the global optimum.}},

   national benefits of freshwater pollution control. By using data from a
   national contingent valuation survey, we estimate the aggregate benefits
   of meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act. A valuation function is
   estimated which depicts willingness to pay as a function of water
   quality, income, and other variables. Several validation checks and
   tests for specific biases are performed, and the benefit estimates are
   corrected for missing and invalid responses. The two major policy
   implications from our work are that the benefits and costs of water
   pollution control efforts are roughly equal and that many of the new
   policy actions necessary to ensure that all water bodies reach at least
   a swimmable quality level will not have positive net benefits.}},

Abstract = {{An empirical equation, giving cumulative soil water infiltration as a
   power function of time, has come to be associated with A. N. Kostiakov.
   Reconsideration shows, however, that instead of the cumulative
   infiltration it was the hydraulic conductivity which he postulated to be
   a power function of time. Furthermore, within the setting he posed,
   there is no rational way of converting the hydraulic conductivity form
   to the cumulative infiltration form. It is therefore recommended that
   the cumulative infiltration form be attributed to M. R. Lewis, who made
   direct and unequivocal use of the cumulative form and appears to have
   been the first to do so.}},

   realizations, stochastic methods are inadequate. This article presents a
   control approach where input variables are only expected to belong in
   certain sets. The objective is to determine sets of admissible control
   actions guaranteeing that the system will remain within desirable
   bounds. The solution is based on dynamic programming and derived for the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a dynamic model of irrigated agriculture that
   accounts for drainage generation and salinity accumulation. Critical
   model relationships involving crop production, soil salinity, and
   irrigation drainage are based on newly estimated functions derived from
   lysimeter field tests. The model allocates land and water inputs over
   time based on an intertemporal profit maximization objective function
   and soil salinity accumulation process. The model is applied to
   conditions in the San Joaquin Valley of California, where environmental
   degradation from irrigation drainage has become a policy issue. Findings
   indicate that in the absence of regulation, drainage volumes increase
   over time before reaching a steady state as increased quantities of
   water are allocated to leaching soil salts. The model is used to
   evaluate alternative drainage abatement scenarios involving drainage
   quotas and taxes, water supply quotas and taxes, and irrigation
   technology subsidies. In our example, direct drainage policies are more
   cost-effective in reducing drainage than policies operating indirectly
   through surface water use, although differences in cost efficiency are
   relatively small. In some cases, efforts to control drainage may result
   in increased soil salinity accumulation, with implications for long-term
   cropland productivity. While policy adjustments may alter the direction
   and duration of convergence to a steady state, findings suggest that a
   dynamic model specification may not be necessary due to rapid
   convergence to a comon steady state under selected scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{A contingent valuation survey was conducted in Kumasi, Ghana, to
   estimate households' willingness to pay for two types of improved
   sanitation services: improved ventilated pit latrines and water closets
   connected to a sewer system. Over 1200 randomly selected households
   throughout the city were interviewed. Most households were willing to
   pay more for improved sanitation service than they were currently paying
   for their existing sanitation system (mostly public and bucket
   latrines), but in absolute terms the potential revenues from households
   are not large, of the order of US\$1.40 per household per month (about
   1-2\% of household income). The results of the study confirm the
   conventional wisdom that conventional sewerage is not affordable to the
   vast majority of households without massive government subsidies. On the
   other hand, it appears that only modest subsidies are required to
   achieve relatively high levels of coverage with on-site sanitation
   (improved ventilated pit latrines). This is because improved ventilated
   pit latrines are much cheaper than conventional sewerage and because
   most households are willing to pay about as much for a ventilated pit
   latrine as for a water closet connected to a sewer. Several tests were
   conducted to check the accuracy of respondents' answers to contingent
   valuation questions. The findings indicate that contingent valuation
   surveys can be successfully carried out in cities in developing
   countries for public services such as sanitation and that reasonably
   reliable information can be obtained on household demand for different
   sanitation technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The growing interest in water market transactions among policymakers and

   within regional markets. Based on econometric analysis of market data,
   water commodity and transaction characteristics are shown to be
   significantly related to market prices. Price dispersion that is
   unexplained by commodity attributes is related to characteristics of the
   regional market, including the number and size distribution of potential

   water commodities traded.}},

Abstract = {{The relative efficiency of service provision by publicly versus

   theoretical debate and empirical investigation for at least the last
   hundred years. This research investigates the relative efficiencies of
   publicly versus privately owned water utilities. The publicly owned
   enterprises are found to be more efficient overall, as well as in the
   technical efficiency associated with the employment of labor, capital,
   energy, and material inputs. No significant differences are found in
   scale efficiencies between the two classes of enterprise. The greatest
   level of inefficiency results from the overuse of capital relative to
   the most efficient firms in the sample, while discrepancies in labor use
   was the least among the four inputs considered.}},

Abstract = {{Complex mathematical simulation models are generally used for
   quantitative measurement of the fate of agricultural chemicals in soil.
   But it is less efficient to use them directly for regional water quality
   assessments because of the large number of simulations required to cover
   the entire region and because the entire set of simulation runs must be
   repeated for each new policy. To make regional water quality impact
   assessment on a timely basis, a simplified technique called metamodeling
   is suggested. A metamodel summarizes the input-output relationships in a
   complex simulation model designed to mimic actual processes such as
   groundwater leaching. Metamodels are constructed and validated to
   predict groundwater and surface water concentrations of major corn and
   sorghum herbicides in the Corn Belt and Lake States regions of the
   United States. The usefulness of metamodeling in the evaluation of
   agricultural nonpoint pollution policies is illustrated using an
   integrated environmental economic modeling system. For the baseline
   scenario, we estimate that 1.2\% of the regional soils will lead to
   groundwater detection of atrazine exceeding 0.12 mug/L, which compares
   well with the finding of an Environmental Protection Agency monitoring
   survey. The results suggest no-till practices could significantly reduce
   surface water concentration and a water quality policy, such as an
   atrazine ban, could increase soil erosion despite the conservation
   compliance provisions.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater treatment plant effluent can be a major contributor to water
   pollution in the United States, yet we know little about how actual
   effluent quality is determined. Although Federal government regulations
   specify uniform minimum treatment levels for these plants, actual
   treatment levels vary considerably from this standard. In addition,
   there is evidence of substantial excess capacity at treatment plants.
   This paper examines the economic and technical relations between actual
   operating and design characteristics of plants. We specify and test
   among alternative models of what determines actual plant performance
   relative to design performance, including one in which plants have the
   incentive to `'overinvest'' and operate with permanent excess capacity
   due to large Federal subsidies on capital costs. The paper then explores
   the determinants of actual effluent quality using a supply and demand
   model in which effluent quality is fully endogenous, allowing treatment
   levels to be a function of both the costs of control, water quality
   characteristics, and other regional or regulatory preferences for
   control. Finally, the model with fully endogenous effluent quality is
   compared to one in which actual levels of plant effluent quality are
   technologically determined by the design characteristics of the plant
   and the exogenous properties of the incoming waste stream.}},

Abstract = {{A catchment scale numerical model is developed based on the
   three-dimensional transient Richards equation describing fluid flow in
   variably saturated porous media. The model is designed to take advantage
   of digital elevation data bases and of information extracted from these
   data bases by topographic analysis. The practical application of the
   model is demonstrated in simulations of a small subcatchment of the
   Konza Prairie reserve near Manhattan, Kansas. In a preliminary
   investigation of computational issues related to model resolution, we
   obtain satisfactory numerical results using large aspect ratios,
   suggesting that horizontal grid dimensions may not be unreasonably
   constrained by the typically much smaller vertical length scale of a
   catchment and by vertical discretization requirements. Additional tests
   are needed to examine the effects of numerical constraints and parameter
   heterogeneity in determining acceptable grid aspect ratios. In other
   simulations we attempt to match the observed streamflow response of the
   catchment, and we point out the small contribution of the streamflow
   component to the overall water balance of the catchment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an array of deformation-dependent flow models of
   various porosities and permeabilities relevant to the characterization
   of naturally fractured reservoirs. A unified multiporosity
   multipermeability formulation is proposed as a generalization of the
   porosity- or permeability-oriented models of specific degree. Some new
   relationships are identified in the parametric investigation for both
   single-porosity and dual-porosity models. A formula is derived to
   express Skempton's constant B by Biot's coefficient H and relative
   compressibility phi{*}. It is found that the recovery of the original
   expression for Skempton's constant B is largely dependent on the choice
   of phi{*}, representing relative compressibility. The
   dual-porosity/dual-permeability model is evaluated through an
   alternative finite element approximation. The deformation-dependent
   fracture flow mechanism is introduced where the rock matrix possesses
   low permeability and fracture flow is dominant. A preliminary study of
   the reservoir simulation identifies the strong coupling between the
   fluid flow and solid deformation.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal channel networks (OCNs) are dendritic structures obtained by
   minimizing the local and global rates of energy dissipation in a
   continuously fed (in space and time) plane aggregation system
   reminiscent, and based on the properties, of the planform of
   three-dimensional natural drainage networks. Geomorphological and
   fractal properties of OCNs are known from earlier studies by the
   authors. This paper explores further the structures derived by
   optimization of energy dissipation rates. Optimality of subnetworks and
   of basin shapes is investigated as a by-product of competition for
   drainage. A new perspective on the possible prediction of the width
   function of a basin network, and hence of its hydrologic response, is
   obtained by exploiting OCN techniques, requiring only the definition of
   the outer boundaries of the basin. The interplay between hillslope
   processes and the development of drainage networks is addressed, aiming
   at the relative role and the mutual interrelations of geology and
   optimal organization in the structure of mature river basins. Also
   addressed is the issue of multiscaling and multifractality in the
   spatial organization of the network. It is concluded that OCN approaches
   provide a comprehensive framework for the study of the morphology of
   geophysical structures.}},

Abstract = {{The field-saturated hydraulic conductivity K(fs) can be obtained from
   measurements of the long-time steady flow rates from ring infiltrometers
   by assuming either that the soil is a `'Green and Ampt'' soil that has a
   relationship between hydraulic conductivity K and soil water pressure
   psi, such that K = K(fs), 0 > psi > psi(f); K --> 0, psi < psi(f), or
   that the soil is a `'Gardner'' soil with an exponential relationship K =
   K(fs) exp(alphapsi), where a is a constant. It is shown that
   infiltration into a Green and Ampt soil from a surface source with zero
   head is the same as that for a Gardner soil with alpha --> infinity
   (gravity dominant) and with a surface source at a head
   \textbackslash{}psi(fs)\textbackslash{}. The shape factor G calculated
   for Gardner soils using a numerical solution of Richards's equation is
   used to calculate K(fs) and alpha from ring infiltrometer tests based on
   Q = {[}aH/G + a/(alphaG) + pia2]K(fs), where Q is the steady state flow
   rate, H is the constant ponded head, and a is the ring radius. The
   equivalent G factor for Green and Ampt soils calculated using electric
   analogue solutions of Laplace's equation is shown to agree very well
   with the numerical solution. The slope of the linear relationship
   between the shape factor and the depth of insertion of the ring divided
   by the radius of the ring is shown to have a slope approximately equal
   to 1/pi.}},

Title = {{EFFECT OF RAINFALL-INDUCED SOIL SEALS ON SOIL-WATER REGIME - WETTING
   PROCESSES}},

Abstract = {{The effects of a rainfall-induced soil seal on wetting processes are
   studied in the cases of two different soils: Hamra (sandy loam) and
   loess (loam). The soil seal is identified as the disturbed upper layer
   where the average hydraulic properties have been changed during rainfall
   from the initial properties that were identical to those of the
   undisturbed soil bed. These properties are derived by applying the seal
   model of Mualem and Assouline (1989), calibrated for the two soils.
   Determination of the seal thickness, bulk density, retention curve, and
   hydraulic conductivity function made it possible to solve systematically
   the flow equation for different boundary conditions, allowing the
   simulation of the wetting processes within the seal layer as well as the
   undisturbed profile underneath. The infiltration curves and the water
   content profiles during and after rainfall are derived for three
   rainfall intensities. The water content and the capillary head profiles,
   as well as the variation of these variables with time, at different
   depths under the soil surface, were also calculated. Smaller amounts of
   the rainfall infiltrate as the rainfall intensity increases. The
   infiltration rate diminishes faster as the rainfall intensity increases.
   The idea of a single infiltration curve as a function of the cumulative
   rainfall seems to be invalid. Each rainfall intensity yields a different
   infiltration curve. A rough validation test of the model yielded
   predicted infiltration curves closely bounded by the experimental
   results. The final infiltration rate after 50 mm of rainfall also seems
   to be a function of the rainfall intensity, with the higher rate
   obtained for the higher rainfall intensity as experimentally observed in
   other studies. Unlike the explanations found in literature, this study
   suggests that a shallower saturated zone within the seal layer is the
   reason for this phenomenon. This study points out that the disturbed
   layer which forms the surface seal is not saturated from the very
   beginning of rainfall. It has a significant water-holding capacity and,
   thus, takes time to reach saturation. Furthermore, under rainfall of
   high intensity, the seal layer reaches saturation only at its upper zone
   close to the soil surface. The lower part may remain unsaturated even
   after 50 mm rainfall and is larger for the soil of coarser texture.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a composite L1 parameter estimator to solve the
   inverse problems in groundwater flow and solute transport modeling. The
   estimator is formulated using a weighted L1 norm as the error measure
   between the vector of the observed hydraulic heads and solute
   concentrations and the corresponding vector of the heads and
   concentrations computed from a finite element model for steady state
   groundwater flow and solute transport in a two-dimensional areal
   confined aquifer system. The parameters currently considered are the
   hydraulic conductivities, the dispersivities, the porosities of the
   aquifer system, and the solute source concentration(s). The gradients of
   the state variables with respect to the parameters are computed
   analytically using a formulation stemming from the finite element model
   for the state variables. The solutions to two hypothetical groundwater
   parameter estimation problems are presented to illustrate that the
   proposed estimator does have the property of being fairly accurate and,
   more significantly, being robust in handling observation data containing
   certain outliers.}},

Abstract = {{Physical experiments were conducted to investigate the transport of a
   dissolved volatile organic compound (trichloroethylene, TCE) from
   shallow groundwater to the unsaturated zone under a variety of
   conditions including changes in the soil moisture profile and water
   table position. Experimental data indicated that at moderate groundwater
   velocities (0.1 m/d), vertical mechanical dispersion was negligible and
   molecular diffusion was the dominant vertical transport mechanism. Under
   these conditions, TCE concentrations decreased nearly 3 orders of
   magnitude across the capillary fringe and soil ps concentrations
   remained low relative to those of underlying groundwater. Data collected
   during a water table drop showed a short-term increase in concentrations
   throughout most of the unsaturated zone, but these concentrations
   quickly declined and approached initial values after the water table was
   returned to its original level. In the deep part of the unsaturated
   zone, the water table drop resulted in a long-term decrease in
   concentrations, illustrating the effects of hysteresis in the soil
   moisture profile. A two-dimensional random walk advection-diffusion
   model was developed to simulate the experimental conditions, and
   numerical simulations agreed well with experimental data. A simpler,
   one-dimensional finite-difference diffusion-dispersion model was also
   developed. One-dimensional simulations based on molecular diffusion also
   agreed well with experimental data. Simulations which incorporated
   mechanical dispersion tended to overestimate flux across the capillary
   fringe. Good agreement between the one- and two-dimensional models
   suggested that a simple, one-dimensional approximation of vertical
   transport across the capillary fringe can be useful when conditions are
   appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the feasibility of coupling regional
   climate models (RCMs) with landscape-scale hydrologic models (LSHMs) for
   studies of the effects of climate on hydrologic systems. The RCM used is
   the National Center for Atmospheric Research/Pennsylvania State
   University mesoscale model (MM4). Output from two year-round simulations
   (1983 and 1988) over the western United States is used to drive a lake
   model for Pyramid Lake in Nevada and a streamflow model for Steamboat
   Creek in Oregon. Comparisons with observed data indicate that MM4 is
   able to produce meteorologic data sets that can be used to drive
   hydrologic models. Results from the lake model simulations indicate that
   the use of MM4 output produces reasonably good predictions of surface
   temperature and evaporation. Results from the streamflow simulations
   indicate that the use of MM4 output results in good simulations of the
   seasonal cycle of streamflow, but deficiencies in simulated wintertime
   precipitation resulted in underestimates of streamflow and soil
   moisture. Further work with climate (multiyear) simulations is necessary
   to achieve a complete analysis, but the results from this study indicate
   that coupling of LSHMs and RCMs may be a useful approach for evaluating
   the effects of climate change on hydrologic systems.}},

   flow of three fluid phases (water, gas, and organic) is modeled.
   Interphase partitioning and transport of an arbitrary number of organic

   of pressure and phase composition. The model includes several numerical
   options, ranging from fully implicit with first-order upstream weighting
   to implicit in pressure, explicit in saturations and concentration with

Abstract = {{Alluvial groundwater adjacent to the main stem river is the principal
   nonpoint source of atrazine and deethylatrazine in the Cedar River of
   Iowa after the river has been in base flow conditions for 5 days.
   Between two sites along a 116-km reach of the Cedar River, tributaries
   contributed about 25\% of the increase in the atrazine and
   deethylatrazine load, whereas groundwater from the alluvial aquifer
   contributed at least 75\% of the increase in load. Within the study
   area, tributaries aggregate almost all of the discharge from tile
   drains, and yet the tributaries still only contribute 25\% of the
   increase in loads in the main stem river. At an unfarmed study site
   adjacent to the Cedar River, the sources of atrazine and deethylatrazine
   in the alluvial groundwater are bank storage of river water and
   groundwater recharge from areas distant from the river. Atrazine and
   deethylatrazine associated with bank storage water will provide larger
   concentrations to the river during early base flow conditions. After the
   depletion of bank storage, stable and smaller concentrations of atrazine
   and deethylatrazine, originating from groundwater recharge, continue to
   be discharged from the alluvial aquifer to the river; thus these results
   indicate that alluvial aquifers are an important nonpoint source of
   atrazine and deethylatrazine in rivers during base flow.}},

Abstract = {{A framework for the modeling of solute flux and related entities in
   partially saturated, heterogeneous porous formations was presented by
   combining a general Lagrangian formulation (Dagan et al., 1992),
   relating the travel time moments of the solute pulse to the velocity
   field, with the stochastic theory of Yeh et al. (1985a, b) for steady,
   unsaturated flow, relating the statistical moments of the velocity field
   to properties of the heterogeneous formation. First-order approximations
   of the travel time covariance were derived for unidirectional, vertical
   mean flow in partially saturated, heterogeneous porous formations of
   three-dimensional structures. Hypothesizing lognormal distribution for
   the one- and two-particle travel time probability density functions, the
   effect of mean water saturation and statistical parameters of the porous
   formation properties on expected values, and variances of the solute
   discharge S and accumulated mass M passing through a given horizontal
   control plane located at an arbitrary vertical distance from the solute
   source, as a function of time were evaluated. Assessment of the
   uncertainty in the predictions of S and M and possible application of
   the results of this investigation to assessment of groundwater
   contamination hazards were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that product moment ratio estimators of the coefficient
   of variation C(upsilon) skewness gamma, and kurtosis kappa exhibit
   substantial bias and variance for the small (n less-than-or-equal-to
   100) samples normally encountered in hydrologic applications.
   Consequently, L moment ratio estimators, termed L coefficient of
   variation tau2, L skewness tau3, and L kurtosis tau4 are now advocated
   because they are nearly unbiased for all underlying distributions. The
   advantages of L moment ratio estimators over product moment ratio
   estimators are not limited to small samples. Monte Carlo experiments
   reveal that product moment estimators of C(upsilon) and gamma are also
   remarkably biased for extremely large samples (n
   greater-than-or-equal-to 1000) from highly skewed distributions. A case
   study using large samples (n greater-than-or-equal-to 5000) of average
   daily streamflow in Massachusetts reveals that conventional moment
   diagrams based on estimates of product moments C(upsilon), gamma, and
   kappa reveal almost no information about the distributional properties
   of daily streamflow, whereas L moment diagrams based on estimators of
   tau2, tau3, and tau4 enabled us to discriminate among alternate
   distributional hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface oil, water, and air saturation distributions were determined
   using 146 samples collected from seven boreholes along a 120-m transect
   at a crude oil spill site near Bemidji, Minnesota. The field data,
   collected 10 years after the spill, show a clearly defined oil body that
   has an oil saturation distribution that appears to be influenced by
   sediment heterogeneities and water table fluctuations. The center of the
   oil body has depressed the water-saturated zone boundary and the oil
   appears to have migrated laterally within the capillary fringe. A
   multiphase cross-sectional flow model was developed and used to simulate
   the movement of oil and water at the spill site. Comparisons between
   observed and simulated oil saturation distributions serve as an
   indicator of the appropriateness of using such models to predict the
   actual spread of organic immiscible liquids at spill sites. Sediment
   hydraulic properties used in the model were estimated from particle size
   data. The general large-scale features of the observed oil body were
   reproduced only when hysteresis with oil entrapment and representations
   of observed spatial variability of hydraulic properties were
   incorporated into the model. The small-scale details of the observed
   subsurface oil distribution were not reproduced in the simulations. The
   discrepancy between observed and simulated oil distributions reflects
   the considerable uncertainty in model parameter estimates and boundary
   conditions, three-phase capillary pressure-saturation-relative
   permeability functions, representations of spatial variability of
   hydraulic properties, and hydrodynamics of the groundwater flow system
   at the study site.}},

Abstract = {{Single-site and multisite periodic autoregressive and moving average
   (PARMA) processes have been suggested for modeling and simulation of
   hydrologic processes. Generation of synthetic samples based on such
   models requires knowledge of the initial conditions, i.e., the values of
   the process at times prior to t = 1. In this paper an initialization
   procedure for generating univariate and multivariate PAR (1), PAR (2),
   and PARMA (1, 1) processes is described. The procedure is based on
   generating the initial values of the process in such a way that the
   variance-covariance structure of the process is preserved. The
   initialization procedure introduced herein is exact and easy to use.
   Examples are included to explain the applicability of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Percolation theory is used in this paper to study the general
   accessibility characteristics of bond site correlated networks in the
   presence or absence of spatial correlations among the sites. Spectral
   methods are employed to generate networks in which the sites are
   spatially correlated according to exponential or Gaussian autocovariance
   functions. Monte Carlo simulations are performed for bond-correlated
   site percolation with and without trapping, as related to drainage-type
   displacements of water by oil (or air) and air by mercury, respectively.
   For the correlation modes studied, it is found that spatial correlations
   result in significant reduction of the site percolation threshold with a
   concomitant modification of the site accessibility. However, the bond
   accessibility characteristics and the bond percolation threshold are not
   significantly affected. The simulated drainage capillary pressure curves
   become more gradual and the residual wetting phase saturation associated
   with oil (or air)-water displacements is significantly decreased when
   spatial correlations among the pore bodies exist.}},

Abstract = {{Several long sediment cores from the Cheyenne River Embayment of Lake
   Oahe, a 250-km-long Missouri River reservoir in South Dakota, have been
   analyzed for radionuclides and stable elements. The combination of
   fine-scale sampling and rapid sedimentation produces radionuclide
   distributions that can be used to estimate the detailed chronology of
   particle transport processes in the Oahe reservoir system. A
   self-consistent and quantitative treatment of the Cs-137 data suggests
   processes to which characteristic times may be associated. Times that
   characterize system-wide processes include (1) an integration time of
   several years reflecting retention of the sediment-bound tracer in
   regions within or external to the reservoir, (2) a relaxation time of
   approximately 15 years reflecting a decreasing rate of sediment
   accumulation ascribed to shoreline stabilization, (3) a time of a few
   months characterizing the breadth of riverine signatures in cores due to
   integration effects in the Cheyenne River system and deltaic deposits,
   and (4) times of a few years associated with propagation of riverine
   load signatures along the embayment. The distribution of total
   sedimentary arsenic confirms the validity of the variable sedimentation
   model. In 1977, a tailings retention facility was built at the Homestake
   Mine site, and the unrestricted input of As ceased. As a result of this
   remedial action, the concentration of sedimentary As decreased
   dramatically. In the upper section of the core, above the depth
   represented by the year 1976, the concentration of As decreases tenfold.
   In this same core the distribution of lithologically discriminating
   chemical elements, calcium and vanadium, relate to major flow events in
   the Cheyenne River basin. Because there is minimal diagenesis of
   chemical constituents in these rapidly accumulating sediments, stable
   element signatures, in addition to radiotracers, may be used to
   reconstruct hydrologic events in drainage basins that contribute
   sediment to lakes and reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The validity of some of the simplifying assumptions in a conceptual
   water balance model is investigated by comparing simulation results from
   the conceptual model with simulation results from a three-dimensional
   physically based numerical model and with field observations. We
   examine, in particular, assumptions and simplifications related to water
   table dynamics, vertical soil moisture and pressure head distributions,
   and subsurface flow contributions to stream discharge. The conceptual
   model relies on a topographic index to predict saturation excess runoff
   and on Philip's infiltration equation to predict infiltration excess
   runoff. The numerical model solves the three-dimensional Richards
   equation describing flow in variably saturated porous media, and handles
   seepage face boundaries, infiltration excess and saturation excess
   runoff production, and soil driven and atmosphere driven surface fluxes.
   The study catchments (a 7.2-km2 catchment and a 0.64-km2 subcatchment)
   are located in the North Appalachian ridge and valley region of eastern
   Pennsylvania. Hydrologic data collected during the MACHYDRO 90 field
   experiment are used to calibrate the models and to evaluate simulation
   results. It is found that water table dynamics as predicted by the
   conceptual model are close to the observations in a shallow water well
   and therefore, that a linear relationship between a topographic index
   and the local water table depth is found to be a reasonable assumption
   for catchment scale modeling. However, the hydraulic equilibrium
   assumption is not valid for the upper 100 cm layer of the unsaturated
   zone and a conceptual model that incorporates a root zone is suggested.
   Furthermore, theoretical subsurface flow characteristics from the
   conceptual model are found to be different from field observations,
   numerical simulation results, and theoretical base recession
   characteristics based on Boussinesq's groundwater equation.}},

Abstract = {{Sophisticated and highly computation-intensive models of transport of
   reactive contaminants in groundwater have been developed in recent
   years. Application of such models to real-world contaminant transport
   problems, e.g., simulation of groundwater transport of 10-15 chemically
   reactive elements (e.g., toxic metals) and relevant complexes and
   minerals in two and three dimensions over a distance of several hundred
   meters, requires high-performance computers including supercomputers.
   Although not widely recognized as such, the computational complexity and
   demand of these models compare with well-known computation-intensive
   applications including weather forecasting and quantum chemical
   calculations. A survey of the performance of a variety of available
   hardware, as measured by the run times for a reactive transport model
   HYDROGEOCHEM, showed that while supercomputers provide the fastest
   execution times for such problems, relatively low-cost reduced
   instruction set computer (RISC) based scalar computers provide the best
   performance-to-price ratio. Because supercomputers like the Cray X-MP
   are inherently multiuser resources, often the RISC computers also
   provide much better turnaround times. Furthermore, RISC-based
   workstations provide the best platforms for `'visualization'' of
   groundwater flow and contaminant plumes. The most notable result,
   however, is that current workstations costing less than \$10,000 provide
   performance within a factor of 5 of a Cray X-MP.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport concepts in soil are based on speculation that solutes
   are distributed nonuniformly within large and small pores. Solute
   concentrations have not previously been measured across a range of pore
   sizes and examined in relation to soil hydrological properties. For this
   study, modified pressure cells were used to measure variation in
   concentration of a solute tracer across a range of pore sizes. Intact
   cores were removed from the site of a field tracer experiment, and soil
   water was eluted from 10 or more discrete classes of pore size.
   Simultaneous changes in water content and unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity were determined on cores using standard pressure cell
   techniques. Bromide tracer concentration varied by as much as 100\%
   across the range of pore sizes sampled. Immediately following
   application of the bromide tracer on field plots, bromide was most
   concentrated in the largest pores; concentrations were lower in pores of
   progressively smaller sizes. After 27 days, bromide was most dilute in
   the largest pores and concentrations were higher in the smaller pores. A
   sharp, threefold decrease in specific water capacity during elution
   indicated separation of two major pore size classes at a pressure of 47
   cm H2O and a corresponding effective pore diameter of 70 mum. Variation
   in tracer concentration, on the other hand, was spread across the entire
   range of pore sizes investigated in this study. A two-porosity
   characterization of the transport domain, based on water retention
   criteria, only broadly characterized the pattern of variation in tracer
   concentration across pore size classes during transport through a
   macroporous soil.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative assessment of water levels and river discharge is often
   made difficult by large distances, limited access, and low population
   densities in remote areas. Satellite altimetry provides a repetitive
   remote sensing approach to determining river levels at a number of
   locations within a river system, providing the orbital repeat cycle is
   short enough in time, the ground track maintains a stable repeat over
   previous locations, and the return power of the altimeter signal can be
   readily identified and located. The U.S. Navy's Geosat radar altimeter
   mission between 1985 and 1989 provided the first altimeter measurements
   with sufficient precision and extended duration to examine the utility
   of such measurements for long-term monitoring of inland waters. These
   measurements have been examined over the Amazon basin. Satellite
   observations are retrieved at four locations that overlap with river
   gauge measurements. A technique is developed to isolate radar return
   signals from the river. Two years of satellite measurements are compared
   with the river gauge retrievals. The overall level of comparison is 0.7
   m rms when the technique is applied manually, and 1.2 m rms when an
   automated version of the method is applied. At one location the average
   difference is 0.2 m rms. This level of accuracy may not be useful for
   routine hydrological measurements. However, there are a variety of
   difficulties that are specific to the Geosat altimeter measurement over
   rough terrain. Present altimeter satellites, ERS 1 (launched June 1991)
   and TOPEX/Poseidon (launched August 1992), correct many of these
   problems. This study suggests that the prospect for obtaining useful
   measurements of river level from space is promising.}},

Abstract = {{An estimate of barometric efficiency, often necessary for aquifer pump
   test interpretation, is difficult to obtain when there is a trend in
   water levels over time. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression methods
   can be used to determine both the barometric efficiency and a trend
   function when the form of the trend is known. Clark's (1967) procedure,
   which does not require specification of the trend functional form, is
   shown to provide an unbiased and consistent estimate of barometric
   efficiency. OLS is only advantageous for a short data record providing
   the form of the trend is known. Clark's method may still be used with
   short data records with a linear trend when augmented by a recursive
   correction procedure. Both methods work best with constant barometric
   efficiency and rapid aquifer-borehole water level equilibration.}},

Abstract = {{The empirical Rothmund-Kornfeld equation was used to describe a
   collection of cation exchange isotherms for K and Ca in Brucedale soil
   over a range of total solution concentrations (C(T)). A comparison of
   variable binary exchange selectivity coefficients (K(KCa)) which vary
   with C(T) and solution phase ion concentrations (C(K), C(Ca)) With
   constant K(KCa) values was thus possible. Percent differences between
   sorbed equilibrium concentrations calculated using variable and constant
   K(KCa) over a range of C(T) and C(K) were arranged into a contour map.
   Zones of potentially observable difference were limited, implying that
   simulations of cation transport using variable and constant K(KCa)
   values would be essentially identical. The predicted effect was examined
   using a numerical model for cation transport. The model successfully
   described observed spatial distributions for cation concentrations
   following constant-flux infiltration of electrolyte solution into soil
   columns. Simulations using variable K(KCa) values provided only a slight
   improvement over simulations using constant K(KCa) values, thus
   validating the use of the contour map as a convenient method to evaluate
   the need to use variable selectivities in simulations of cation
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{Water was applied uniformly as a fine spray onto the surface of beds of
   nonabsorbing particles. The outflow at the base of the bed was collected
   separately from 74 equal, small collecting areas. The spatial
   heterogeneity of the outflow was determined as a function of bed height,
   particle diameter, and the size of the collection areas. The results
   show that spatial heterogeneity develops with increasing bed depth and
   decreases with increasing area of the collectors. Particle diameter has
   only a small effect on flow heterogeneity. It is hypothesized that
   spatial heterogeneity develops because individual flow pathways, or
   rivulets, take a `'random walk'' downward through the particles in the
   bed. When two flows meet by chance, they combine and stay combined. In
   this way, the number of rivulets per unit cross-sectional area of bed
   decreases with increasing depth, and the spatial flow heterogeneity
   increases. It is proposed that this process may occur in the tilled
   layer of soil.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of pipe water demand in developing countries have traditionally
   analyzed household connection decisions to the pipe water system. On the
   other hand, empirical observations have revealed that often, after
   connecting, households do not use their pipe water supply, or augment it
   with alternative sources. Due to deficiencies in pipe water quality,
   pressure, or availability, households invest in coping strategies in the
   form of alternative supplies and storage facilities. Because these
   strategies have important economic implications, there is a need to
   develop an understanding of households' water demand that goes beyond
   connection decisions. This paper presents a model system of household
   water supply choices. The system accounts for the fact that households
   may use different supply systems for different uses of water. Moreover,
   the relation between households' choices of water supply and their
   connection decisions is explicitly modeled. The approach is illustrated
   using data from Faisalabad, Pakistan.}},

Abstract = {{The Massachusetts Water Management Act was enacted in 1986 to preserve
   the State's water resources. The intent of the Act was to allow for
   sustained economic growth while protecting the natural environment by
   minimizing the occurrence of low stream flows. As a result of the act, a
   permit must be obtained for new water withdrawals (including increases
   on existing withdrawals) of more than 0. 1 million gallons per day
   (0.00438 m3/s). The permits specify the degree to which applicants may
   withdraw water, and reserve the right to curtail use during low flow
   seasons. A linear programming model is presented that is capable of
   assisting regulatory agencies in specifying details of permits for
   groundwater use. The model links groundwater withdrawals with surface
   streamflow, considering consumptive use and interbasin transfers, The
   optimization minimizes the depletion of streamflow below a standard
   while honoring the statistical distribution of allowed withdrawals
   permitted each applicant. The results specify the amount and timing of
   allowed withdrawals throughout the year.}},

Abstract = {{This research develops a dynamic model of input regulation in the
   presence of externalities that do not occur simultaneously with input
   use. The model is formulated to study the regulation of firms that apply
   fertilizer, where leachate from the application of fertilizer
   accumulates in groundwater over time. In the model we show the
   derivation of an optimal nitrogen user fee and the consequences of
   regulatory design when time lags between nitrogen application and
   nitrate contamination are present. This research also responds to the
   need of developing a general solution algorithm for an optimal control
   model when the control variable exhibits a delayed response. A
   multistage solution algorithm presented in this paper is different from
   other studies in that a typical relationship is not assumed for the
   state and adjoint variables.}},

Abstract = {{Eddy correlation measurements of sensible and latent heat flux are used
   with measurements of net radiation, soil heat flux, and other
   micrometeorological variables to develop the Penman-Monteith,
   Shuttleworth-Wallace, and modified Priestley-Taylor evapotranspiration
   models for use in a sparsely vegetated, semiarid rangeland. The
   Penman-Monteith model, a one-component model designed for use with dense
   crops, is not sufficiently accurate (r2 = 0.56 for hourly data and r2 =
   0. 60 for daily data). The Shuttleworth-Wallace model, a two-component
   logical extension of the Penman-Monteith model for use with sparse
   crops, performs significantly better (r2 = 0. 7 8 for hourly data and r2
   = 0. 85 for daily data). The modified Priestley-Taylor model, a
   one-component simplified form of the Penman potential evapotranspiration
   model, surprisingly performs as well as the Shuttleworth-Wallace model.
   The rigorous Shuttleworth-Wallace model predicts that about one quarter
   of the vapor flux to the atmosphere is from bare-soil evaporation.
   Further, during daylight hours, the small leaves are sinks for sensible
   heat produced at the hot soil surface.}},

Abstract = {{Three equilibrium sand transport formulae were tested for prediction of
   the suspended bed material transport rate in the silt-laden Huanghe
   (Yellow River): Ackers and White (1973), Engelund and Hansen (1967), and
   Van Rijn (1984b). The best results were obtained with the Van Rijn
   function. However, at low flow stages better results were produced by
   the Engelund-Hansen equation. The Ackers-White formula seriously
   overpredicted the measured values. Some modifications of the Van Rijn
   formula were proposed for application in flows over very fine sand and
   silt. In a verification analysis it was demonstrated that these
   modifications slightly improve its predictive strength. Also, attention
   was paid to the effect of turbulence damping by sediment particles at
   high concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The oft-used `'standard'' mixing cell model describing reactive solute
   transport is extended to cater for nonequilibrium reactions. For tracer
   transport, the standard model is second-order accurate in the space and
   time discretization used. However, an error analysis of the standard
   model reveals that its accuracy is degraded when reactions are included.
   An `'improved'' model which maintains second-order accuracy is
   developed. The improved mixing cell model is demonstrated to be more
   accurate than the standard model. The solution obtained from the
   improved model is found to agree very well with the results of a
   numerical Crank-Nicolson solution for various isotherms. The improved
   mixing cell predictions are also shown to agree very well with the exact
   solution for the two-site adsorption model, where a linear isotherm is
   considered. Application of the improved model was illustrated by
   simulating the experimental data from a laboratory Ca-K exchange
   experiment in which a solution containing Ca was passed through a column
   filled with K-saturated soil. The model was used in conjunction with the
   experimentally determined nonlinear adsorption isotherm to predict the
   experimental breakthrough data. By changing the value of kinetic
   coefficient, it was demonstrated that the predictions varied markedly.
   However, the simulations suggest that the equilibrium model is more
   appropriate than the assumption of nonequilibrium.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Rock fragments on soil surfaces can have a variety of contrasting
   effects on the hydraulics of overland flow and soil erosion. This makes
   modeling soil erosion difficult. Systematic studies are needed to assess
   the effects of rock fragments on the hydraulics of overland flow and to
   specifically relate these hydraulics to sediment yield. Therefore flume
   experiments were conducted in which overland flow was applied to a
   highly erodible sediment surface covered by various percentages of rock
   fragments. High local turbulence was caused by horseshoe vortex erosion
   around individual rock fragments. For a given discharge and slope, the
   dimension of the scour was affected by the space between the rock
   fragments. For low cover percentages the scour can develop undisturbed,
   and sediment yield increases with percent of rock fragment cover up to
   about 20\%. Sediment yield then declines as percent cover increases
   above 20\%. Beyond a cover threshold value of 20\%, the larger
   opportunity for scour hole development is counteracted by limited
   inter-rock fragment space that does not allow scour holes to develop to
   their full extent. As sediment yield varies nonmonotonically with rock
   fragment cover percent, sediment yield cannot be predicted by spatially
   averaged flow hydraulics.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary integral equation method is formulated for problems
   concerning unsaturated moisture flow in porous media. The boundary
   integral formulation presented here is derived using the time-dependent
   fundamental solution of the governing partial differential equation. Two
   boundary integral approaches are presented. The first approach solves
   the unsaturated moisture flow problem by directly applying the
   time-dependent Green's function. The second method is based on the
   expansion of moisture content into a perturbation series. The governing
   equation is decomposed into a moisture flow equation without a known
   gravity term on the right-hand side. The perturbation equations are then
   solved in succession by evaluating the gravity term of the unsaturated
   leachate flow equation from the preceding solution level. The two
   boundary integral approaches, the direct Green's function and the
   perturbation Green's function, are closely related because the same
   time-dependent fundamental solution is used to formulate the boundary
   integral expressions. The direct Green's function formulation solves the
   boundary integral expression in one step. However, the perturbation
   Green's function approach requires solution of the integral expression
   for homogeneous boundary conditions. The solutions obtained by both
   methods are compared with the exact solution. A close agreement of the
   internal fluxes between boundary integral methods and the exact
   solution, for an unsaturated portion of a landfill, shows the stability
   of the boundary integral methods to compute accurate recharge from the
   unsaturated zone to the saturated leachate mound.}},

Abstract = {{A management concern with waste dumps is the movement of leachate into
   local groundwater systems. This paper presents a model to predict the
   saturated-unsaturated flow of water within such waste dumps. The model
   predicts moisture movement when the surface of the dump is bare and when
   it has revegetated. For the bare state, the evaporation rate is related
   to a number of complex processes, including atmospheric transport,
   radiation balance, and subsurface water supply in either liquid or vapor
   forms. Transpiration from the revegetated heap is related to the leaf
   area index and rooting depth, both of which change as plants grow.
   Mechanisms influencing vapor transport are considered in some detail,
   and a nonequilibrium approach employed to explain combined liquid and
   vapor movement. The mathematical problem consists of solving a system of
   coupled, nonlinear, partial differential equations which are related
   dynamically to the surface boundary conditions. The boundary conditions
   are determined by a combination of meteorological variables as well as
   the type and amount of plant cover. A moving node finite element method
   is presented which has the capability of automatically relocating nodes
   to areas of numerical difficulty. This method is validated through
   comparison with a proven solution to the unsaturated flow equation. The
   next paper in this series presents the application of the model to oil
   shale waste dumps.}},

Abstract = {{The application of a model for the movement of water within waste dumps,
   described in a previous paper, requires the estimation of a range of
   physical characteristics. Parameters relating to the transfer of liquid
   water, water vapor, heat, and air within the waste dump must be
   estimated in addition to surface parameters which determine the
   interaction between subsurface processs and the atmospheric boundary
   layer. Three different methods are used to estimate the hydraulic
   conductivity and moisture retentivity: an inverse analysis based on
   field measurements of moisture movement; an application of the
   instantaneous profile method; and the Haverkamp-Parlange method. The
   water vapor-air diffusivity and intrinsic permeability of air are
   estimated, as well as the thermal properties of the various waste
   materials. The model presented previously is refined through a series of
   sensitivity analyses and applied to simulate the water movement observed
   within a lysimeter. Model predictions were particularly sensitive to the
   surface roughness. Evaporation from a bare surface was found to be
   related primarily to the surface moisture content, most evaporation
   occurring directly after rainfall. The contribution of vapor transport
   to cumulative evaporation was not significant in comparison to the
   contribution of liquid flow, even for long periods of dry surface
   conditions. Finally, the model is applied to predict the moisture
   movement within waste dumps that could be expected from an oil
   shale-mining operation.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic state space model for the estimation of river temperature
   is presented, setting the stage for its implementation in optimal
   control algorithms. Physical processes modeled include advection,
   diffusion, and environmental heat exchange; the mathematical formulation
   is one dimensional. The deterministic formulation uses a hybrid
   characteristics-finite differences numerical scheme for the solution of
   the governing equations. The stochastic formulation accounts for
   uncertainty due to model assumptions, errors in the model inputs and
   parameters, and river temperature measurements. Model use is
   demonstrated by the estimation of temperatures in a 5-mile (8 km) reach
   of the Des Plaines River, Illinois, below the Joliet power station.
   River temperature measurements and hydrological and meteorological data
   are used to estimate the model parameters; model formulation and
   limitations are assessed based on the model application results. The
   stochastic formulation improves river temperature estimation, as
   measured by the mean, variance-covariance, correlation, and range of the

Abstract = {{Two mass balance equations were used to model the transfer of dissolved
   chemicals from the soil solution to the surface runoff water and the
   transport of these chemicals to the field outlet. One mass balance
   equation was written for chemicals dissolved in the overland water, the
   other for chemicals within the soil profile. Chemical input into the
   surface water (upper boundary condition) was expressed as a rate-limited
   convective mass transfer, depending on both soil surface and runoff
   concentrations. Isolating a slow and fast time scale and scaling the
   mass balance equations to the slow one yielded a parameter, epsilon,
   which multiplies the time derivative of the mass balance equation
   written for overland flow. In most cases epsilon much less than 1,
   providing a singular perturbation problem that was solved by using the
   method of matched asymptotic expansion. The approximate solution,
   uniformly valid over the entire domain, was made up of two terms: a
   leading-order solution and a first-order solution, the latter of which
   was relatively small, even for epsilon = O(1). The leading-order
   solution was compared with that for a simpler case, in which the
   convective mass transfer (upper boundary condition) depends only on the
   soil surface concentration. The comparison indicated those limited cases
   to which the simpler boundary condition can be applied resulting in a
   very small error. Although it is not possible to get a strictly
   analytical solution for a problem involving a modified upper boundary
   condition, the approximate analytical solution is easily obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Stream networks and catchment basins are characterized by numerous
   fractal dimensions, the traditional one being the mainstream length as a
   function of length scale which we denote by d. We consider an ideal
   Horton system and define fractal dimensions based on (1) the
   subcatchment length-area relationship, which gives D1 ; (2) the total
   length of streams as a function of scale, which gives a network
   similarity dimension D2; (3) the mainstream length-area relationship
   (D3), and (4) the total area of streams as a function of areal scale
   (D4). These fractal dimensions are related to the values of the
   bifurcation ratio, the stream length ratio, and the stream area ratio.
   Their value should be indirectly estimated from these Horton parameters.
   An improved understanding of the relationships between the fractal
   dimension and Horton's laws is obtained by defining an eigenarea of a
   stream of a particular Horton order. This is the area of the drainage
   basin which is not drained by streams of immediately lower order. The
   variation of eigenareas with scale controls the value of D1 , which
   equals D3 for hydrologically realistic systems. In such cases D4 = 2.
   This paper assumes that river systems are Hortonian in nature and that
   measured departures from Hortonianity are due to statistical
   variability. Estimates of the Horton parameters and of the fractal
   dimensions are therefore subject to uncertainty. Two sources of
   statistical variability are considered herein: The first source of
   statistical variability is due to the fluctuations in stream numbers,
   stream lengths, and stream areas. These fluctuations affect the values
   of the Horton parameters, which are traditionally estimated using a
   graphical technique. We show that an analytical technique (which
   corresponds to a constrained graphical technique) is preferable. The
   second source of variability that we consider arises from the fact that
   estimates of Horton's parameters and fractal dimensions are always made
   on truncated systems because the particular scales of measurement
   determine the order of the catchment. In a Horton system it is
   straightforward to estimate D1, which is defined exactly at all scales.
   Direct attempts to estimate D2 and D3 (as opposed to indirect attempts
   via the Horton parameters) are difficult because their true value is
   approached asymptotically in the limit of infinite-order catchments.}},

Abstract = {{A model based on the two-dimensional stochastic advection-diffusion
   equation is developed to forecast properties of individual rain cells in
   urban areas such as speed and spatial rainfall intensity. Two different
   modeling approaches are employed, and examples of the results are given.
   The first approach involves a Gaussian distribution as an analytic
   solution to the advection-diffusion equation, whereas the second one
   entails a double Fourier series expansion of the rainfall intensity
   field. Both modeling approaches are used to predict the rainfall
   intensity field over a small 12-gage urban catchment in southern Sweden.
   The model parameters are continuously updated by extended Kalman
   filtering. The Fourier series approach is shown to be the most flexible
   for practical applications and to give the most accurate forecasts. This
   model approach gives acceptable forecasts for a lead time of 1-5 min. It
   gives consistently smaller prediction errors compared to both the
   Gaussian solution and simple extrapolation calculations. The effect of
   system noise level on the forecast accuracy and model performance is
   discussed. The model can be used not only to predict in real time the
   spatial rainfall, but also to parameterize the variability pattern of
   small-scale spatial rainfall into a set of physically based parameters,
   thus separating the effects of advective velocity, turbulent diffusion,
   and development/decay.}},

Abstract = {{Lakeshore erosion, characterized as a reduction in distance between
   property improvements and the lake, will eventually threaten
   improvements. An option price model suggests that erosion-prone
   lakeshore property will be discounted and this discount may be measured
   by hedonic price analysis. We discuss the conditions that permit benefit
   estimation from the hedonic regression. Analysis of mail survey returns
   estimates willingness to pay for erosion protection, as measured by the
   number of years remaining until property improvements are endangered.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents optimization models for waste load allocation from
   multiple point sources which include both parameter (Type II) and model
   (Type I) uncertainty. These optimization models employ more
   sophisticated water quality simulation models, for example, in the case
   of dissolved oxygen modeling, QUAL2E and WASP4, than is typically the
   norm in studies on the optimization of waste load allocation.
   Variability in selected input parameters to the water quality simulation
   models gives rise to stochastic dynamic programming approaches. Two
   types of reliability and feasibility attributes are highlighted,
   associated with the management options that are generated. Several
   dissolved oxygen simulation models are incorporated into the
   optimization procedures to explore the effects of Type I uncertainty on
   control decisions. Information from simultaneous consideration of
   multiple simulation models is aggregated in the dynamic programming
   framework through two regret-based formulations. By accommodating both
   model and parameter uncertainty in the modeling framework, trade-offs
   can be generated between the two so as to assess their influence on
   control decisions. The models are applied to a waste load allocation
   problem for the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania.}},

Abstract = {{Institutional economics provides an alternative framework for analyzing
   existing and proposed water policies. This approach differs from
   conventional economics in both normative and positive aspects. The
   normative model employs the concept of instrumental value, rather than
   efficiency. Water policies are judged based on whether they foster the
   long-run viability of economic and ecological systems, not on whether
   they maximize net present value. The positive model is holistic and more
   inclusive than standard market models. The role of technical
   circumstances, nonmonetary goals, interest groups, and power are
   discussed. The implications of both positive and normative models for
   water policy are discussed. A set of questions useful in understanding
   or predicting the prospects for change in water policy is provided. and
   an institutionalist perspective is offered on water markets.}},

Abstract = {{Differential dynamic programming with quasi-Newton approximations
   (QNDDP) is combined with a finite element groundwater quality simulation
   model to determine optimal time-varying pumping policies for reclamation
   of a contaminated aquifer. The purpose of the QNDDP model is to
   significantly reduce the large computational effort associated with
   calculation of optimal time-varying policies. A Broyden rank-one
   quasi-Newton technique is developed to approximate the second
   derivatives of the groundwater quality model; these second derivatives
   are difficult to calculate directly. The performance of the QNDDP
   algorithm is compared to the successive approximation linear quadratic
   regulator (SALQR) technique, which sets the complicated second
   derivatives to 0. QNDDP converged to the optimal pumping policy in
   approximately half the time that the SALQR technique required. The QNDDP
   algorithm thus shows great promise for the management of complex,
   time-varying systems.}},

Abstract = {{Results of dissolution experiments with trapped nonaqueous phase liquids
   (NAPLs) are modeled by a mass transfer analysis. The model represents
   the NAPL as isolated spheres that shrink with dissolution and uses a
   mass transfer coefficient correlation reported in the literature for
   dissolving spherical solids. The model accounts for the reduced
   permeability of a region of residual NAPL relative to the permeability
   of the surrounding clean media that causes the flowing water to
   partially bypass the residual NAPL. The dissolution experiments with
   toluene alone and a benzene-toluene mixture were conducted in a
   water-saturated column of homogeneous glass beads over a range of Darcy
   velocities from 0.5 to 10 m d-1. The model could represent the observed
   effluent concentrations as the NAPL underwent complete dissolution. The
   changing pressure drop across the column was predicted following an
   initial period of NAPL reconfiguration. The fitted NAPL sphere diameters
   of 0.15 to 0.40 cm are consistent with the size of NAPL ganglia observed
   by others and are the smallest at the largest flow velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Simulated annealing is used to analyze alternate design strategies for
   groundwater remediation at a contaminated field site. The simulated
   annealing optimization algorithm is combined with a field-scale flow and
   transport simulation model for an unconfined aquifer to determine nearly
   optimal pumping schedules for a pump-and-treat remediation system at a
   proposed Superfund site in central California. A series of demonstration
   problems is presented using two different optimization formulations. The
   results of these experiments indicate that the method can be applied to
   realistic groundwater management problems. The computational expense of
   simulated annealing is large yet comparable to other nonlinear
   optimization techniques. A practical empirically based strategy is
   provided for selecting and adjusting the parameters necessary for
   successful optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Changes over time in the species composition of fish communities in
   Adirondack lakes were assessed to determine (1) the approximate numbers
   of fish populations that have been lost and (2) the degree to which fish
   population losses may have resulted from surface water acidification and
   acidic deposition. Information on the present-day status of fish
   communities was obtained by the Adirondack Lakes Survey Corporation,
   which surveyed 1469 Adirondack lakes in 1984-1987 (53\% of the total
   ponded waters in the Adirondack ecological zone). Two hundred and
   ninety-five of these lakes had been surveyed in 1929-1934 during the
   first statewide biological survey; 720 had been surveyed in one or more
   years prior to 1970. Sixteen to 19\% of the lakes with adequate
   historical data appeared to have lost one or more fish populations as a
   result of acidification. Brook trout and acid-sensitive minnow species
   had experienced the most widespread effects. Populations of brook trout
   and acid-sensitive minnows had been lost apparently as a result of
   acidification from 11\% and 19\%, respectively, of the lakes with
   confirmed historical occurrence of these taxa. By contrast, fish species
   that tend to occur primarily in lower elevation and larger lakes, such
   as largemouth and smallmouth bass and brown trout, have experienced
   little to no documented adverse effects. Lakes that were judged to have
   lost fish populations as a result of acidification had significantly
   lower pH and, in most cases, also had higher estimated concentrations of
   inorganic aluminum and occurred at higher elevations than did lakes with
   the fish species still present. No other lake characteristics were
   consistently associated with fish population losses attributed to
   acidification. The exact numbers and proportions of fish populations
   affected could not be determined because of limitations on the quantity
   and quality of historical data. Lakes for which we had adequate
   historical data to assess long-term trends in fish communities were
   significantly larger and deeper and have higher pH than do Adirondack
   lakes in general; thus, fish communities adversely affected by
   acidification and acidic deposition may be underrepresented in this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between habitat characteristics and reproductive
   status of Adirondack brook trout populations were examined utilizing the
   Adirondack Lake Survey Corporation data base, which includes physical,
   chemical. and biological data for 1469 lakes. The only variables
   strongly related to brook trout natural reproduction were indices of
   groundwater influence on surface water chemistry, specifically silica
   and sodium concentrations. This finding supports the hypothesis that
   lake spawning populations of brook trout are strongly dependent on
   groundwater seepage for successful reproduction. Spawning habitat in
   small headwater lakes impounded by beaver activity may be degraded as a
   result of siltation of nearshore zones and diminished groundwater
   seepage. Adirondack lakes situated in thick-till basins receive
   proportionally greater groundwater input than thin-till lake types and
   thick-till lakes also had the highest proportion of self-sustaining
   brook trout populations. Acidification is most pronounced in thin-till
   basins, which also exhibited a low frequency of self-sustaining brook
   trout populations. Although brook trout fisheries may be maintained in
   acidic lakes by liming and stocking, the establishment of
   self-sustaining brook trout populations is not a likely outcome of these
   management practices. Additionally, there appears to be limited
   potential for restoration of lake spawning brook trout populations in
   currently acidic, fishless lakes should acidic inputs decline as a
   result of reductions in acid-forming emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Mineral acids and bases influence pH largely through their effects on
   acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). This influence becomes particularly
   significant as ANC approaches zero. Analysis of data collected by the
   Adirondack Lakes Survey Corporation (ALSC) from 1469 lakes throughout
   the Adirondack region indicates that variations in ANC in these lakes
   correlate well with base cation concentrations (C(B)), but not with the
   sum of mineral acid anion concentrations (C(A)). This is because (C(A))
   is relatively constant across the Adirondacks, whereas C(B) varies
   widely. Processes that supply base cations to solution are ion-specific.
   Sodium and silica concentrations are well correlated, indicating a
   common source, mineral weathering. Calcium and magnesium also covary but
   do not correlate well with silica. This indicates that ion exchange is a
   significant source of these cations in the absence of carbonate
   minerals. Iron and manganese concentrations are elevated in the lower
   waters of some lakes due to reducing conditions. This leads to an
   ephemeral increase in C(B) and ANC. When the lakes mix and oxic
   conditions are restored, these ions largely precipitate from solution.
   Sulfate is the dominant mineral acid anion in ALSC lakes. Sulfate
   concentrations are lowest in seepage lakes, commonly about 40 mueq/L
   less than in drainage lakes. This is due in part to the longer hydraulic
   detention time in seepage lakes, which allows slow sulfate reduction
   reactions more time to decrease lake sulfate concentration. Nitrate
   typically influences ANC during events such as snowmelt. Chloride
   concentrations are generally low, except in lakes impacted by road salt.}},

Abstract = {{Past approaches for evaluating the effects of organic acids on the
   acid-base characteristics of surface waters have typically treated them
   solely as weak acids. Analysis of data collected by the Adirondack Lakes
   Survey Corporation (ALSC) from 1469 lakes throughout the Adirondack
   region shows that this approach is not valid. While the data indicate
   that natural organics contain a continuum of acid functional groups.
   many of which display weak acid characteristics, a significant fraction
   of the organic acid is strong (pK(a) < 3). Dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) contributes 4.5-5 mueq/mg DOC of strong acid to solution. The
   associated anions make a negative contribution to Gran acid-neutralizing
   capacity (ANC). Because organic anions can produce negative Gran ANC
   values, the common practice of considering negative values of Gran ANC
   evidence of acidification solely by mineral acids is not valid. The
   strength of organic acids also influences the observed deviation between
   Gran ANC values and ANC values calculated as the difference between base
   cation and mineral acid anion concentrations (C(B) - C(A)). Ninety
   percent of the deviation is due to the presence of strong organics while
   the remaining 10\% is due to DOC-induced curvature in the F1 Gran
   function. Organic acids can also strongly influence pH. Their largest
   effects were found in the 0-50 mueq/L Gran ANC range where they
   depressed pH by up to 1.5 units. In addition. a method for predicting
   changes in pH in response to changes in mineral acidity, DOC. or both
   without having to rely on inferred thermodynamic constants and the
   uncertainties associated with them has been developed. Using the
   predictive method, the response of representative lakes from four
   sensitive lake classes to a 15-mueq/L decrease in mineral acidity ranged
   from +0.17 to +0.38 pH units. If concurrent increases in DOC are
   considered, the pH changes would be even smaller.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation rates over Lake Kinneret were directly and continuously
   measured by means of the eddy correlation system (ECS) for the
   relatively long periods of 20 and 44 days at the beginning and end of
   the summer (first and second periods), respectively. Results clearly
   show that wind speed and stability of thermal stratification over the
   water surface strongly affect evaporation from the lake. Consequently,
   large differences in measured daily evaporation rates were apparent
   during both periods. Evaporation rates, estimated by the energy budget
   method (EBM) were compared with the corresponding values measured
   directly by the ECS. Large differences were found between the estimated
   hourly evaporation rates and the measured ones, in both the values and
   the timing of maximal rates. In addition, the EBM calculated negative
   nocturnal evaporation rates, while the ECS measured positive values.
   Differences between estimated and measured evaporation rates monitored
   on a daily basis were also noted. The differences were larger for the
   first period, characterized by sharav events denoting climatic
   instability. High evaporation rates resulting from strong winds were not
   depicted by EBM estimates. The distributions of hourly evaporation rates
   over a 24 hour period or of the daily rates over an entire period as
   estimated by the EBM were very similar to those of net radiation, while
   corresponding distributions resulting from ECS measurements were very
   similar to those of wind speed. The daily average evaporation rate for
   the first period, calculated by the EBM, was smaller than the
   corresponding value resulting from ECS measurements. When applied on a
   hourly basis, the EBM gave a much more similar estimate. For the second
   period, there were no significant differences between the daily average
   based on the computed values (for both daily and hourly intervals) and
   the corresponding average based on the measured ones.}},

Abstract = {{The horizontal distribution of evaporation over a small lake surrounded
   by heterogeneous terrain is quite complex. It is therefore usually not
   possible to provide accurate evaporation estimates for the whole lake
   based upon a single observational site, even if this site is located
   offshore. In the present study, a numerical two-dimensional
   terrain-following mesometeorological model is applied to Lake Kinneret
   (area of 170 km2, located in northern Israel) to obtain appropriate
   spatial and temporal resolution of the climatic parameters needed to
   estimate evaporation. The model is verified by comparing its calculated
   evaporation rates with those measured at an offshore site by the eddy
   correlation system and by its ability to reproduce well-established
   characteristics of the microclimate over the lake. Results indicate
   that, for the typical meteorological conditions characterizing the
   experimental period, a concave horizontal distribution of evaporation
   rate is predicted across the lake. Consequently, the assumption of a
   uniform evaporation rate over the whole lake equal to that at the
   measuring site could lead to a misestimation of the amount of water lost
   through the evaporative process.}},

Abstract = {{In numerical simulations of flow through heterogeneous formations, the
   domain is partitioned into numerical elements. The solution requires
   assigning physical properties to each numerical block. The process of
   transferring information from the scale of actual heterogeneity to that
   of the numerical elements is known as upscaling. We consider steady,
   one-phase flow and the only property of interest is the permeability,
   which is regarded as a random space function, and the same is true for
   the upscaled conductivity. In this paper we establish the necessary and
   sufficient conditions to be satisfied by upscaling. The necessary
   conditions are expressed with the aid of the global response of the
   formation, e.g., the total flux caused by a constant pressure head drop
   applied on the boundaries. The requirement is that the expected value
   and the variance of the total flux are the same in the actual and
   upscaled domains. These are supplemented by local conditions which
   stipulate that space averages of flow variables over the numerical
   blocks in the upscaled domain tend to those in the actual formation when
   the elements size tends to 0. The result of this analysis is that the
   upscaled permeability must be such as to ensure the equality. in a
   statistical sense, between the space averaged dissipation in the two
   media. By assuming an unbounded domain, average uniform flow and
   stationarity, simplified relationships between the moments of the
   dissipation in the upscaled and actual media are derived. It is shown
   that the effective permeability of the two media is the same, The
   approach is illustrated for stratified formations for which exact
   composition rules are possible. Even in this simple case the upscaled
   permeability is a tensor, characterized at second order by two mean
   components and three covariance functions.}},

Abstract = {{The general methodology developed in part 1 (Indelman and Dagan, this
   issue) of this study is applied to the detailed analysis of upscaled
   permeability. First, the structure of the dissipation function for the
   general conductivity, a tensor of stationary random components, is
   examined with the aid of dimensional analysis. It is shown that for
   arbitrary shapes of the numerical elements, the upscaled permeability
   has also this general structure, and the numbers of unknown parameters
   and equations match. This result suggests that the upscaling problem has
   an unique solution. In the particular case of scalar permeability of
   isotropic covariance of the actual formation, it is shown that a similar
   upscaled permeability is possible only for spherical (circular)
   numerical elements. Otherwise, the upscaled permeability has to be a
   tensor of anisotropic covariance. If the actual formation has a scalar
   permeability of axisymmetric covariance, upscaling preserves the last
   property only for axisymmetric partition elements. i.e., for a sphere,
   cylinder, and ellipsoid. Explicit expressions for the first moments of
   the upscaled permeability (mean, covariance) are derived at first order
   in the log permeability variance. The detailed computations for a scalar
   permeability of axisymmetric covariance and for axisymmetric numerical
   elements lead to simple results. The upscaled permeability expected
   values are components of an axisymmetric tensor, whereas the
   fluctuations are determined by a scalar random space function of
   anisotropic covariance. The general case of upscaling by a first-order
   approximation is examined in Appendix B. These results will be applied
   to a few particular cases in part 3 (Indelman, this issue).}},

Abstract = {{The general results of Indelman and Dagan (this issue (a), (b)) are
   applied to some cases of interest in applications. The exact solution of
   upscaling of stratified formations is used in order to assess the range
   of applicability of the first-order analysis. The explicit expressions
   of the two first moments of the upscaled permeability are derived for
   media of two-dimensional isotropic and three-dimensional axisymmetric
   actual log permeability of Gaussian covariance and for parallelepipedic
   (rectangular for two-dimensional) averaging elements. The effects of the
   actual log permeability covariance and of the anisotropy of partition
   elements on the upscaled permeability statistics are analyzed. The
   asymptotic behavior of the upscaled permeability for large and small
   blocks is discussed for general heterogeneity. The strong dependence of
   the small element limit on the properties of actual heterogeneity and on
   the shape of the elements is illustrated by typical examples. In
   contrast, the homogenization of the upscaled media by large blocks
   depends primarily on the volume (area for two dimensions) of the
   partition element relative to the one based on the correlation scale of
   the log permeability.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution for transient soil-gas diffusion coupled to two
   convective-dispersive solute transport equations is presented.
   First-order kinetic transformations, linear equilibrium distribution
   coefficient for both solutes, and equilibrium gas solubility for the
   gaseous product were assumed. The solution was obtained by means of
   Laplace transforms for zero initial concentrations of all three species,
   pulse application of both solutes, and semi-infinite media.
   Concentration profiles of the soil gas as a function of soil depth and
   time were computed. An example problem was used to demonstrate the use
   of the solution and its sensitivity to various parameters. The solution
   was verified by comparison to a numerical solution using an explicit
   finite difference scheme. The analytical solution shows that the
   soil-gas distributions were highly affected by the gas solubility and by
   the distribution coefficient and the transformation rate constants of
   both solutes. However, the gas distributions were not significantly
   affected by the dispersion coefficient of either solute. The gas
   distributions are slightly affected by changes in the gas diffusivity
   over the range expected for different gas species at a single value of
   air-filled porosity. Changes in soil-water content and the corresponding
   change in air-filled porosity would result in large changes in the gas
   concentration profiles.}},

Abstract = {{In a series of pH 7 continuous-flow column experiments, removal of the
   bacteriophage MS-2 by attachment to silica beads had a strong,
   systematic dependence on the amount of hydrophobic surface present on
   the beads. With no hydrophobic surface, removal of phage at p H 5 was
   much greater than at pH 7. Release of attached phage at both pH values
   did occur, but was slow; breakthrough curves exhibited tailing.
   Poliovirus attached to silica beads at pH 5.5 much mor, than at pH 7.0,
   and attachment was also slowly reversible. Time scales for phage and
   poliovirus attachment were of the order of hours. The sticking
   efficiency factor (alpha), reflecting microscale physicochemical
   influences on virus attachment, was in the range of 0.0007-0.02. Phage
   release was small but measurable under steady state conditions. Release
   was enhanced by lowering ionic strength and by introducing beef extract,
   a high-ionic-strength protein solution. Results show that viruses
   experience reversible attachment/detachment (sometimes termed sorption),
   that large chemical perturbations are needed to induce rapid virus
   detachment, and that viruses should be quite mobile in sandy porous
   media. Even small amounts of hydrophobic organic material in the porous
   media (greater-than-or-equal-to 0.001\%) can retard virus transport.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified Newton iteration method with Galerkin linear finite
   elements is developed for the solution of the nonlinear transient
   unsaturated flow equation in `'mixed'' form. The use of the Galerkin
   linear finite element method in the spatial discretization produces a
   recurrence equation in which the internode hydraulic conductivity is
   represented by an integrated average expression which generates the
   exact Darcy flow flux through each element under the steady horizontal
   flow condition. The numerical computation of the integrated average
   hydraulic conductivity using Simpson's 1/3 rule leads to an accurate
   solution even in the presence of a sharp front. In the time
   discretization using a backward Euler scheme, the standard Newton
   iteration method is simplified by taking account of the integrated
   average expression of the hydraulic conductivity and the
   diffusion-dominated nature of the flow process. The resulting two-level
   scheme is of the same efficiency on a per-iteration basis as the
   modified Picard scheme but converges at a faster rate.}},

Abstract = {{The production of microbially derived CO2 was investigated in the 3.6 m
   thick unsaturated geologic media of a mesoscale model system. The
   mesoscale model, which was 2.4 m diameter x 4.6 m high, was filled with
   a medium grained lacustrine sand, capped with an A(p) (0.11 m) and B
   (0.20 m) soil profile, and maintained under steady state moisture
   conditions for 343 days. A near steady state soil gas CO2 concentration
   profile (>100 times greater than atmospheric) developed after 130 days
   implying that geochemical stability was rapidly attained. The presence
   of metabolically active microorganisms, consumption of O2 and dissolved
   organic carbon, and carbon 13 data indicated that the CO2 was
   microbially produced. At steady state, the calculated and modeled CO2
   flux to the atmosphere (about 0.9 mol m-2 day-1) were greater than the
   measured CO2 flux (0.1 mol m-2 day 1) and greater than the calculated
   CO2 flux to the water table (0.02 mol m-2 day-1). The difference between
   the calculated and measured fluxes of CO2 to the atmosphere was
   attributed to spatial variability in the gas diffusion coefficient and
   reflected the difficulty in estimating CO2 production, even under steady
   state conditions. Laboratory estimates of microbial CO2 fluxes (1.8 and
   2.9 x 10(3) mol m-2 day-1 were much greater than those determined from
   measured and calculated fluxes. Measured microbial respiration rates
   suggested that between 50 and 70\% of the respired CO2 was produced in
   the unsaturated geologic medium beneath the A(p) and B, and that there
   was sufficient CO2 production potential by bacteria to account for the
   respired CO2 determined from the flux calculations. These observations
   indicated that long-term experimentation in mesoscale models can
   overcome some of the difficulties encountered in field studies and
   provide insight into biogeochemical processes in natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to derive the transmissivity of an
   equivalent homogeneous medium having the same macroscopic flow behavior
   as the actual heterogeneous formation. We apply generalized Taylor-Aris
   moment analysis in order to determine the phenomenological coefficient
   of transmissivity for the case of saturated flow confined in a
   heterogeneous permeable formation with variable thickness. The
   generalized Taylor-Aris moment analysis yields a two-step procedure for
   determining the constant two-dimensional transmissivity tensor from the
   three-dimensional spatially variable conductivity tensor: solve a flow
   problem and then perform an integration. For the special case that the
   conductivity is locally isotropic and the impermeable confining surfaces
   are parallel, the equations governing transmissivity are discretized
   using a pseudospectral Fourier-Galerkin scheme. The resultant system of
   linear algebraic equations is solved efficiently, using preconditioned
   conjugate gradients, in order N(t) ln (N(t)) operations, where N(t) is
   the number of spatial discretization points. The numerical method is
   used in several examples to compute the transmissivity of lognormally
   distributed hydraulic conductivity, and the results are compared with
   the transmissivity found using the usual depth-averaging approach and
   another method suggested in the literature. The numerical results show
   that the averaging volume required to obtain an effective value of
   transmissivity is about 10 horizontal integral scales. When the flow
   field has a significant three-dimensional character, the standard method
   of finding transmissivities by depth averaging can lead to significant
   errors in the prediction of global scale flows. It is shown that depth
   averaging consistently overestimates transmissivities. An example
   illustrates how in the case of tilted strata, anisotropic
   transmissivities arise and how the degree of transmissivity anisotropy
   depends on the angle of the dip and the horizontal to vertical integral
   scale ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Kernel density estimation methods have recently been introduced as
   viable and flexible alternatives to parametric methods for flood
   frequency estimation. Key properties of such estimators are reviewed in
   this paper. Attention is focused on the selection of the kernel function
   and the bandwidth. These are the parameters of the method. Existing
   techniques for kernel and bandwidth selection are applied to three
   situations: Gaussian data, skewed data (three-parameter gamma), and
   mixture data. The intent was to investigate issues relevant to parameter
   estimation as well as to the likely performance of these methods with
   the small sample sizes typical in hydrology. Bandwidths chosen by
   minimizing a performance criterion related to the distribution function
   lead to much smaller mean square errors of tail probabilities than those
   chosen by cross-validation methods designed for density estimation.
   However, this can lead to estimates that degenerate to the empirical
   distribution function, and hence to an unusable flood frequency curve.
   Variable bandwidths with heavy tailed kernels appear to do best. Kernel
   estimators are increasingly more competitive in terms of mean square
   error of estimate as the underlying distribution gets more complex.}},

Abstract = {{Variance spectra were generated for three high-frequency near-surface
   soil temperature time series representative of soil conditions typically
   encountered in temperate regions: saturation, strong evaporation. and
   soil frost penetration. For the latter two conditions, a surrogate
   measure of the soil water ionic concentration was also obtained and
   variance spectra were calculated. In a purely conductive system of
   multiday duration. maximum thermal variance should occur at a wavelength
   of 1 day and should decrease with depth. During ground saturation, when
   the pores are occupied by water, this pattern is observed. However, a
   spectral power density peak is observed in the subdiurnal and subhourly
   range coincident with surface evaporation or freezing. In addition, the
   ionic concentration of soil water at depth is strongly coupled to
   temperature variations at the surface. These patterns are atypical of
   conductive systems and suggest the operation of nonconductive heat
   transfer processes, particularly water advection, phase transformations
   of water, and high-velocity internal distillation.}},

Abstract = {{Helium isotopic and rare gas measurements in the Dogger aquifer of the
   Paris Basin have shown the helium concentration and helium isotopic
   ratio to be first-order homogeneous with only slight differences in
   relation to specific chemical water types. Helium in the Dogger aquifer
   contains quantities of He-3 3-4 times in excess of radiogenic
   production/accumulation from natural decay of U, Th series elements.
   Calculations of cosmogenic production/accumulation of He-3 cannot
   account for the observed excesses, and He-3 excess is attributed to the
   addition of a mantle-derived He magmatic component. Calculations of the
   isotopic fluxes of helium out of the Dogger (He-4 flux, 2 x 10(-7) mol
   He-4 m-2 yr-1; He-3 flux, 1.8 x 10(-14) mol He-3 m-2 yr 1 (+/-50\%))
   suggest that the helium residence time and the groundwater residence
   time in the Dogger aquifer are 4 Myr (+/-50\%). This age estimate is at
   least 10 times as great as estimates derived from hydrologic models but
   is more consistent with the geochemistry of the water.}},

Abstract = {{The ratio of the lithogenic nuclides Ra-226 and Th-232 indicates that
   the major source of sediment in transport in a gullied catchment,
   located in the head waters of Whiteheads Creek, New South Wales,
   Australia, is the gully itself. This observation is supported by Be-7
   and Cs-137 concentrations which indicate that the sediment is derived
   from erosion of either gully floor or gully wall material. While
   subcatchment Be-7 and Cs-137 data show sheet, rill, and gully erosion
   are occurring in the upstream catchments, sediment from these sources is
   either being trapped before entering the gully, or the volume of
   sediment is small compared to that derived from the gully itself. The
   differences in the Ra-226 to Th-232 ratio between the suspended solids
   collected on the rising stage and samples of sediment deposited during
   the failing stage at the outlet of the catchment, indicate a change in
   the source of sediment during storm events. The results presented here
   demonstrate the applicability of radionuclide tracers in providing
   quantitative estimates of the relative contributions of individual
   catchments to the sediment moving within a drainage network, and in
   determining whether or not the sediments are mainly derived from subsoil
   or topsoil sources.}},

Abstract = {{A capillary barrier arises in unsaturated conditions at the contact of a
   fine layer of soil overlying a coarse layer of soil. If such a contact
   is tilted. infiltrating moisture in the fine layer will be diverted and
   flow down the contact as capillary diversion. Capillary barriers can
   occur naturally in layered heterogeneous systems. or they can be
   engineered for the purpose of diverting infiltration, for example, away
   from hazardous wastes. Recent theoretical analyses of capillary
   diversion have revealed some simple relations for the behavior of an
   idealized capillary barrier. Meanwhile, laboratory experiments and field
   investigations have shown much more complicated behavior. We have
   attempted to bridge the gap between the simple theoretical results and
   the more complicated laboratory and field observations by means of
   numerical experiments. Numerical modeling of capillary barriers presents
   significant challenges because of the potential for gravitational
   instability which can give rise to strong space discretization and grid
   orientation effects. We have examined the ability of different finite
   difference techniques, such as harmonic weighting, upstream weighting,
   and higher-order differencing, to represent flow exclusion and leakage
   effects at capillary barriers. The numerical experiments show that
   analytical results previously obtained are reasonable, but that leakage
   occurs upstream of the theoretical breakthrough point. Furthermore, in
   the breakthrough region and downstream from it, the behavior is
   considerably more complicated than assumed in the theoretical analysis.
   Numerical experiments, with careful consideration of space
   discretization and grid orientation effects, reveal that the initial
   breakthrough allows sufficient leakage at the contact to partially dry
   the upper layer, making the barrier active again downstream. Finite
   difference schemes specifically designed to handle transient multiphase
   flows can adequately reproduce the broad features of flow diversion and
   leakage at capillary barriers.}},

Abstract = {{An extended version of the Muskingum flood routing model is developed
   for application to river systems where multiple tributaries, gaged at
   upstream stations, unite to a single channel downstream. The Muskingum
   storage equation is redefined to include the tributary flows as
   independent inflows to the channel system by increasing the number of x
   parameters. The routing equation is accordingly modified to contain
   tributary flows as individual inflows through an increased number of
   coefficients. An efficient method of analysis is presented which yields
   direct estimates of the routing coefficients. The model automatically
   takes into account any effect of ungaged tributary flows and/or lateral
   inflow in the prediction of outflow. Application of the model, using the
   method of analysis presented, has been demonstrated on the Meghna river
   system in Bangladesh. in both real time forecasting and reconstruction
   modes. The results thus obtained are encouraging.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to investigate the effect of solute size.
   pore water velocity, and intraparticle porosity on dispersion and to
   delineate conditions under which it is appropriate to use a
   tracer-derived dispersivity to represent the dispersivity of other,
   dissimilar-sized solutes. This was accomplished by evaluating the
   physical properties of four porous media and the results of several
   column experiments performed with nonreactive tracers and these media.
   Intraparticle porosities of three sandy media were shown to constitute
   negligible fractions of the total porosities. As a result, intraparticle
   diffusion did not contribute to dispersive flux. The contribution of
   intraparticle diffusion, as well as film diffusion, to solute dispersion
   in fine-grained media having small intraparticle porosities will be
   negligible for most conditions. In addition, the importance of axial
   diffusion decreases as pore water velocity increases. Hydrodynamic
   dispersion is the predominant source of dispersion under these
   conditions, and, as such, dispersivity is essentially independent of
   solute size. Dispersivities determined with a tracer may therefore be
   used to represent the dispersivity of other, dissimilar-sized solutes.
   Under these conditions, the practice of using a nonreactive tracer such
   as H2O to characterize the dispersive properties of a soil column is
   valid. Solute dispersion in an aggregated soil was shown to be caused by
   a combination of hydrodynamic dispersion, film diffusion, and
   intraparticle diffusion. In addition, axial diffusion was shown to be
   important at low pore water velocities. Hence. the apparent
   dispersivities obtained by applying the single-component dispersion
   equation to transport in structured soils will generally be a function
   of solute size. The use of a tracer-derived dispersivity for solutes of
   different sizes would not be valid in this case.}},

Abstract = {{Although the constitutive relationship of relative permeability as a
   function of saturation has been examined extensively in soil science and
   petroleum engineering, there is little information about this
   relationship for many systems encountered at hazardous waste sites. This
   lack of data has led to the use of estimation methods for relative
   permeability without verifying that they are indeed applicable to
   systems representative of hazardous waste sites. To assess the accuracy
   of methods commonly used for the prediction of two-phase relative
   permeabilities, drainage and imbibition relative permeabilities were
   measured for several organic liquid-water systems. A comparison of these
   measurements with estimates generated with five common methods showed
   that these methods are limited in their predictive capabilities. They
   estimated the relative permeability to the aqueous phase well, but
   failed to predict the low permeability to the organic liquid. For the
   relative permeability to the organic liquid to reach the predicted value
   of unity at the residual aqueous phase saturation, the effective
   permeabilities must be normalized by the permeability measured in the
   presence of residual water. The common estimation techniques make no
   provision for hysteresis. Since the aqueous phase showed little
   hysteresis, these estimations methods can be applied to both drainage
   and imbibition processes for this phase. However, the organic liquid
   phase showed hysteresis, and thus these techniques may only be
   appropriately applied to drainage for the nonwetting phase.}},

Abstract = {{The bed of an initially straight channel often deforms into a series of
   migrating alternate bars that can cause bank erosion and the development
   of periodic planform curvature which is often expressed as a meandering
   channel trace. The planform curvature in turn leads to topography
   similar to alternate bars, but stationary with respect to the meander.
   The migration of alternate bars over this steady topography may lead to
   interactions influencing meander initiation and wavelength selection. We
   studied these interactions in flume channels with bends of various
   lengths and angles, and having various width-to-depth ratios. In
   channels whose wavelength was equal to the length of bars in straight
   channels (nearly eight channel widths), bars migrated through
   sine-generated channels with angles up to 10-degrees. The critical bend
   angle was smaller for channels of longer wavelength and smaller
   width-to-depth ratio. Migration was nonuniform, and bars temporarily
   stalled when in phase with the curvature-induced topography, leading to
   amplification of the topography. Flow against an opposing bank can lead
   to such a strong boundary shear stress divergence that migration of the
   bars is prevented because sediment that otherwise would have led to bar
   migration is scoured from the bar front. We propose that the
   amplification of bar-pool topography in bends where free alternate bars
   are stalled enhances scour of the bank which leads to selection of a
   meander wavelength equal to that of the alternate bars.}},

Abstract = {{A method of identifying the underlying distribution form for
   precipitation is proposed in this paper. This method is different from
   the classical hypothesis-testing method and is based upon using regional
   data. Two fundamental assumptions are made: (1) the distribution forms
   of rainfall at all stations in a studied area are the same, and the
   third L moment ratios, tau3, at all stations are also the same; and (2)
   the unknown underlying distribution form is one among five commonly used
   distributions: i.e., generalized extreme value (GEV), gamma (GAM),
   lognormal (LON), generalized Pareto (PAR), and generalized logistic
   distribution (LGI). Using the proposed method, one can not only choose a
   distribution form for the given data, but also know the probability that
   the identification is correct. For a parameter within the range commonly
   occurring in practice, this probability is reasonably high. Therefore
   the proposed method would be valuable and informative.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of the soil surface moisture (theta(s)) with respect to
   dairy bare soil evaporation (E(d)) is analyzed using data from numerical
   simulations. This was performed by running a mechanistic model of heat
   and water flows in the soil. The mechanistic model was calibrated and
   validated on three different soils with contrasted hydraulic properties.
   Results show that theta(s) does not allow an accurate estimate of the
   ratio of E(d) to the daily potential evaporation (Ep(d)). Added
   variables such as Ep(d) and the wind velocity are necessary to improve
   the prediction of the E(d)/Ep(d) ratio. In a second attempt, a simple
   model of E(d) is proposed. It is based on three empirical parameters and
   required the measurement of theta(s) obtained at midday, Ep(d), and the
   daily wind velocity. For a given soil, a single set of the three
   parameters allows an accurate estimate of E(d) under soil moisture and
   climatic conditions encountered through the year in temperate areas.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the influence of climate parameters on seasonal streamflow in
   watersheds over a range of elevations in California and Oregon. Effects
   of precipitation, temperature, and snow water content (SWC) are
   diagnosed using linear regression models and categoric composites. Most
   of the models explain over 60-80\% of the seasonal streamflow
   variability. The models and the composites provide insight into the
   climate influences which drive the individual watersheds. Low (warmer)
   basins have little snow and little memory of prior seasons' climate
   variability. High (cooler) basins, with more snow, have longer memories.
   Precipitation has the greatest influence on streamflow variations in
   spring. Temperature is important in spring in the mid and high
   elevations. By late spring, SWC accounts for nearly all of the summer
   streamflow variation at mid and high elevations, but earlier in the
   runoff season, precipitation and temperature add variance. The
   variations in surface climate parameters, including streamflow, are
   generally controlled by atmospheric circulation anomalies with a spatial
   scale much larger than those in watersheds. This explains why little
   skill was lost by broadening the scale of temperature and precipitation
   predictors to regional climate areas.}},

Abstract = {{Field values of horizontal hydraulic conductivity measured in the upper
   1.5-5.5 m of a weathered and fractured clay-rich till were strongly
   influenced by smearing around piezometer intakes, which occurs during
   augering, and by the physical scale of the measuring device. Values
   measured in conventional augered piezometers were typically 1-2 orders
   of magnitude lower than those measured in piezometers designed to reduce
   smearing. Measurements of hydraulic conductivity in small-scale seepage
   collectors or piezometers, which typically intersect fewer than 10
   fractures, vary over a much greater range, 10(-10) to 10(-6) m/s, than
   large-scale values based on infiltration into 5.5-m-deep trenches which
   intersect thousands of fractures (range 10(-7) to 3 x 10(-7) m/s).
   Values of hydraulic fracture aperture, 1-43 mum, and fracture porosity,
   3 x 10(-5) to 2 x 10(-3), were calculated using the cubic law with
   fracture orientation/distribution measurements and the small-scale
   hydraulic conductivity measurements. This paper provides the first
   reliable determination of the magnitude and spatial distribution of
   hydraulically derived fracture parameters in a clay deposit. The absence
   of such data has, until now, severely limited the application of
   quantitative groundwater flow and contaminant transport models in this
   type of deposit.}},

Abstract = {{Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements have been made to
   assess the use of NMR in quantifying the pore-scale behavior of
   hydrocarbon contaminants in porous rocks. NMR measurements were made on
   bulk water, bulk gasoline (the selected hydrocarbon contaminant), and a
   sample of Berea sandstone, saturated to various levels with the two
   fluids. When the sandstone contained either water or gasoline,
   decreasing the level of fluid saturation resulted in a linear decrease
   in the total integral of the signal amplitude and in the relaxation time
   T1. The first effect allows for the determination of the level of fluid
   saturation from the NMR data; the second effect indicates the
   preferential drainage of large pores as saturation decreases for both
   fluids. A significant difference in liquid/rock interaction, which was
   quantified by calculating the surface sink parameter of the two systems,
   resulted in separation between the response of the gasoline and the
   water when the sandstone sample was saturated with a mixture of the two
   liquids. NMR laboratory measurements proved to be a useful means of
   detecting and estimating the quantity of a contaminant present in a
   porous rock.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides a quantitative analysis of the effects of neglecting
   the quadratic-gradient term in solving the diffusion equation governing
   the transient pressure distribution during high pressure-gradient
   injection of compressible liquids in porous media. Mathematical
   solutions of the two-dimensional cylindrical-symmetry nonlinear
   diffusion equation are derived by using the Laplace transform. A fully
   penetrating well bore in a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium is
   considered. The analysis accounts for well bore storage and incorporates
   a wide range of boundary conditions. Analytical early- and late-time
   solutions are also presented for some cases. Quantitative deviations
   from existing linear solutions are related to a dimensionless group, a,
   which is proportional to the fluid compressibility; the higher the
   magnitude of a, greater is the deviation of the nonlinear solutions from
   the linear ones. The linear pressure and rate solutions are generally
   within 0.5\% of the corresponding nonlinear solutions for the constant
   pressure inner boundary. However, for the constant discharge-rate
   condition, the error may be as high as 10\% (within the ranges of a and
   dimensionless radius and time considered). The error may be even higher
   for higher injection rates in flow systems with smaller transmissivity.}},

Abstract = {{Burgers' equation can be considered a special case of the
   one-dimensional Richards' equation for vertical flow for which the soil
   water diffusivity is constant and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity
   is proportional to the square of the reduced water content. Here, a
   Fourier series solution for Burgers' (1948) equation for a finite region
   is presented. The solution is useful to modelers seeking a simplified
   representation of vertical water flow through the vadose zone and as an
   analytical solution for benchmarking which maintains many of the
   nonlinear characteristics of solutions to Richards' equation. Two
   example problems are presented. In the first, infiltration into a dry
   soil is modeled showing that Burgers' equation gives developing wetting
   front profiles similar to those observed for Richards' equation. In the
   second example, one-step outflow from an 8-cm core is modeled.
   Comparisons between the analytical and finite difference solutions for
   Burgers' equation are presented to help verify the analytical solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Conceptual rainfall-runoff models are difficult to calibrate by means of
   automatic methods; one major reason for this is the inability of
   conventional procedures to locate the globally optimal set of
   parameters. This paper investigates the consistency with which two
   global optimization methods, the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA)
   method (developed by the authors) and the multistart simplex (MSX)
   method, are able to find the optimal parameter set during calibration of
   the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model (SAC-SMA) of the National
   Weather Service River Forecast System (NWSRFS). In the first phase of
   this study, error-free synthetic data are used to conduct a comparative
   evaluation of the algorithms under `'ideal'' conditions. In 10
   independent trials of each algorithm in which 13 parameters of the
   SAC-SMA model were optimized simultaneously, the SCE-UA method achieved
   a 100\% success rate in locating the precise global optimum (i.e., the
   `'true'' parameter values) while the MSX method failed in all trials
   even with more than twice the number of function evaluations. In the
   second phase, historical data from the Leaf River watershed are used to
   conduct a comparative evaluation of the algorithms under `'real''
   conditions, using two different estimation criteria, DRMS and HMLE; the
   SCE-UA algorithm obtained consistently lower function values and more
   closely grouped parameter estimates, while using one-third fewer
   function evaluations than the MSX algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A unified linear theory for the transport of adsorbing solutes through
   soils is presented and applied to analyze movement of napropamide
   through undisturbed soil columns. The transport characteristics of the
   soil are expressed in terms of the travel time distribution of the
   mobile phase which is then used to incorporate local interaction
   processes. This approach permits the analysis of all linear transport
   processes, not only the small subset for which a differential
   description is known. From a practical point of view, it allows the
   direct use of measured concentrations or fluxes of conservative solutes
   to characterize the mobile phase without first subjecting them to any
   model. For complicated flow regimes, this may vastly improve the
   identification of models and estimation of their parameters for the
   local adsorption processes.}},

Abstract = {{Geometrical measurements of sandstone pore microstructure (e.g., Katz
   and Thompson, 1985) indicated that both the surface and volume of pores
   are self-similar and exhibit the same fractal dimension. This result
   yields the microscale hydraulic conductivity to be given as a function
   of the inner and outer cutoffs and fractal dimension. Accordingly, the
   fractal dimension can be viewed as the imprint of the process
   responsible for shaping the structure of voids in a porous medium. We
   show that the same approach can be extended to different porous media,
   e.g., to granular aggregates, and it can also be used to describe the
   soil structure at the scale of the representative elementary volume. For
   this purpose the fractal rock fragmentation model proposed by Turcotte
   (1986) has been used to derive the particle size distribution for a
   fractal mixture. Sedimentation of this mixture is then simulated using a
   ballistic aggregation algorithm, and both the solid phase and the void
   space geometry of the resulting aggregate are analyzed. The results show
   that the same fractal dimension embedded in the fragmentation process is
   preserved by the sedimentation mechanism and it also characterizes the
   volume of the pore space and the spatial distribution of the particles.}},

Abstract = {{Under the assumption that the only information available on a drainage
   basin is its mean elevation, the connection between entropy and
   potential energy is explored to analyze drainage basins morphological
   characteristics. The mean basin elevation is found to be linearly
   related to the entropy of the drainage basin. This relation leads to a
   linear relation between the mean elevation of a subnetwork and the
   logarithm of its topological diameter. Furthermore, the relation between
   the fall in elevation from the source to the outlet of the main channel
   and the entropy of its drainage basin is found to be linear and so is
   also the case between the elevation of a node and the logarithm of its
   distance from the source. When a drainage basin is ordered according to
   the Horton-Strahler ordering scheme, a linear relation is found between
   the drainage basin entropy and the basin order. This relation can be
   characterized as a measure of the basin network complexity. The basin
   entropy is found to be linearly related to the logarithm of the
   magnitude of the basin network. This relation leads to a nonlinear
   relation between the network diameter and magnitude, where the exponent
   is found to be related to the fractal dimension of the drainage network.
   Also, the exponent of the power law relating the channel slope to the
   network magnitude is found to be related to the fractal dimension of the
   network. These relationships are verified on three drainage basins in
   southern Italy, and the results are found to be promising.}},

Abstract = {{Variably saturated water flow in a dual-porosity medium may be described
   using two separate flow equations which are coupled by means of a sink
   source term GAMMA(w) to account for the transfer of water between the
   macropore (or fracture) and soil (or rock) matrix pore systems. In this
   study we propose a first-order rate expression for GAMMA(w) which
   assumes that water transfer is proportional to the difference in
   pressure head between the two pore systems. A general expression for the
   transfer coefficient alpha(w) was derived using Laplace transforms of
   the linearized horizontal flow equation. The value of alpha(w) could be
   related to the size and shape of the matrix blocks (or soil aggregates)
   and to the hydraulic conductivity K(a) of the matrix at the
   fracture/matrix interface. The transfer term GAMMA(w) was evaluated by
   comparing simulation results with those obtained with equivalent one-
   and two-dimensional single-porosity flow models. Accurate results were
   obtained when K(a) was evaluated using a simple arithmetic average of
   the interface conductivities associated with the fracture and matrix
   pressure heads. Results improved when an empirical scaling coefficient
   gamma(w) was included in alpha(w). A single value of 0.4 for gamma(w)
   was found to be applicable, irrespective of the hydraulic properties or
   the initial pressure head of the simulated system.}},

Abstract = {{Steady state flow between an injection well and a pumping well in a
   heterogeneous confined aquifer is investigated using a combined
   numerical-empirical approach. Transmissivity at the measurement or point
   support scale is modeled as an isotropic, stationary, multivariate
   lognormal spatial random function. In a recent study (Desbarats, 1992)
   it was found that the effective transmissivity of a single-well radial
   flow system was very well estimated by a spatial geometric average of
   point transmissivities weighted by their inverse squared distance from
   the well bore axis. This result provides an approximate solution for
   steady state drawdown in a heterogeneous medium which can be used with
   the principle of superposition to derive an expression for the interwell
   head difference in a dipole well configuration. The interwell
   transmissivity corresponding to this head difference is shown to be the
   harmonic mean of transmissivities averaged over circular regions
   centered at each well. This deterministic averaging law and the
   geostatistical model for point transmissivities are combined in order to
   derive expressions for the ensemble mean and variance of interwell
   transmissivity. Expressions are also obtained for the conditional
   moments of interwell transmissivity when values at the two wells are
   available from core measurements. Multiple realizations of the
   heterogeneous transmissivity field, discretized on a nodal grid, are
   generated using the turning bands method. Interwell transmissivities
   obtained by spatial averaging over the grid are compared with
   corresponding true effective values obtained numerically using a finite
   difference model of steady state interwell flow. Empirical and numerical
   values are found to be in excellent agreement for variances of log
   transmissivity as high as 5. Further numerical experiments show that
   results of this study are relatively insensitive to moderate departures
   from the multivariate lognormal transmissivity model.}},

Abstract = {{Time-stratified sampling of sediment for estimating suspended load is
   introduced and compared to selection at list time (SALT) sampling. Both
   methods provide unbiased estimates of load and variance. The magnitude
   of the variance of the two methods is compared using five storm
   populations of suspended sediment flux derived from turbidity data.
   Under like conditions, the SALT coefficient of variation was 1.4-7.7
   times that of time-stratified sampling. Time-stratified sampling
   performs well if the range of sediment flux in each stratum is small.
   This requirement can be met by using small sample sizes in many short
   strata. Theoretically, SALT sampling has the potential for smaller
   sampling variance; however, it is difficult to select an auxiliary
   variable that predicts flux well under diverse flow conditions. An
   `'optimum'' auxiliary variable formed from the largest storm performed
   about as well as time-stratified sampling for the larger storms.
   Time-stratified sampling ensures that specimens are collected in all
   storms, facilitating load estimation for individual storms. In contrast,
   SALT can better allocate sampling resources over different size storms,
   enabling efficient estimation of the total load for longer periods.
   Because time-stratified sampling is less sensitive to the way
   measurements are allocated to different parts of the population, it is
   preferred for estimating storm loads of multiple constituents from the
   same sample.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the computational performance of the recently introduced
   spectral approach for the time integration of finite element flow
   equations is performed. Two reduction methods are presented and
   discussed. One method relies on the classical modal decomposition
   wherein the leftmost eigenpairs of a generalized symmetric eigenvalue
   problem are evaluated one at a time by a cost-effective orthogonal
   deflation technique. The other uses a set of Lanczos vectors for the
   coordinate transformation matrix and involves a recursive product
   between the inverse of the stiffness matrix and a vector. An extensive
   analysis of the behavior of the two methods is made with a
   representative sample problem of subsurface flow solved over a regular
   and an irregular mesh. The results show that the spectral approach
   cannot be competitive from a computational viewpoint with a more
   traditional time-stepping or direct integration scheme (e.g., the
   Crank-Nicolson scheme). The eigenvector technique is slow to converge,
   and a large portion, if not all, of the `'flow modes'' need to be
   determined to accurately describe the desired solution. The Lanczos
   algorithm may converge faster in the Lanczos vector space. However, its
   actual performance depends to a large extent on the initial guessed
   vector and is adversely influenced by the requirement to solve an
   equivalent steady state problem at each iteration. It is concluded that
   for a robust and efficient finite element code of transient groundwater
   flow, direct integration methods are generally to be preferred.}},

Abstract = {{Simplifications to the depth-integrated soil water transport equation
   lead to an Ito stochastic differential equation where the evaporation is
   related to the stored water by the nonlinear soil water diffusivity
   function. From the derived equation the diffusivity function was
   estimated from daily stored water measurements obtained at the field
   scale using nonlinear filtering theory for a period of 100 days.
   Comparisons with daily evaporation measured with a sensitive 50-ton
   lysimeter indicated that the proposed method may be used to determine
   soil water diffusivity functions at the field scale under natural
   conditions when applied water and evaporation are the primary
   controlling physical mechanisms in the hydrologic budget.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the Southern Oscillation on daily precipitation in the
   southwestern United States is examined by using the Southern Oscillation
   Index (SOI) to perturb parameters of a stochastic daily precipitation
   model. Daily precipitation is modeled with a Markov chain-mixed
   exponential model and seasonal variability of model parameters is
   described by Fourier series. The hypothesized linkage between the SOI
   and the model parameters is of the form G(i)(N, t) = G(i)(t) + b(i)S(N,
   t - tau(i)) where G(i)(N; t) is the perturbed parameter i for day t of
   year N, G(i)(t) is the annually periodic parameter i for day t, b(i) is
   a coefficient, S is the SOI, and tau(i) is a lag in days. Daily
   precipitation data for 27 stations in California, Nevada, Arizona, and
   New Mexico were analyzed. Perturbations of the logits of the dry-dry
   transition probabilities resulted in statistically significant
   improvements in the log likelihood function for 23 stations and
   perturbations of the mean daily rainfall resulted in significant
   increases for 18 stations. The most common lag identified was 90 days,
   suggesting the possibility of conditional simulations of daily
   precipitation. Seasonal effects were detected, confirming the results of
   previous analysis with groups of stations.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-eight coupled observations of flow. transport, and bed surface
   grain size distribution were made in a laboratory flume using a wide
   range of flows and a sediment with a very poorly sorted. bimodal grain
   size distribution. These observations permit the transport rates of
   individual size fractions to be scaled by the proportion of each size
   immediately available for transport on the bed surface. The key to our
   observations is the use of a sediment in which each size fraction has
   been painted a different color, which permits reliable, repeatable. and
   nondestructive measurement of the bed surface grain size distribution
   from photographs of the bed surface. At a given flow, the fractional
   transport rates may be divided into two parts: a finer-grained portion
   within which fractional transport rates are a function only of their
   proportion on the bed surface and total transport rate, and a
   coarser-grained portion for which fractional transport rates also depend
   on the proportion of individual grains within a fraction that remain
   essentially immobile throughout the experimental run. We define the
   latter condition as one of partial transport and observe that the grain
   size separating partial and fully mobilized transport consistently
   increases with flow strength. Complete mobilization of a size fraction
   occurs at roughly twice the shear stress necessary for incipient motion
   of that fraction. Zones of partial and full mobility are quite distinct
   when fractional transport rates are scaled by the bed surface grain size
   distribution, although a region of partial transport is evident when
   these data and other experimental and field observations are scaled by
   the bulk grain size distribution of the sediment bed. Critical shear
   stresses for the incipient motion of individual fractions in our
   experimental sediment vary over an order of magnitude, a result strongly
   in contrast to many earlier observations, but consistent with our
   observations of incipient motion in sediments with bimodal grain size
   distributions.}},

   by public agencies to consider alternative institutional arrangements to
   the traditional regulatory approach to water allocation and use. In
   irrigated agriculture, a market-based system linked to enforceable
   property rights to water is seen as preferable to rule-based management
   of water resources. However, significant social and economic
   considerations and political realities constrain the unfettered
   operation of water markets. The challenge facing the irrigation industry
   in Australia is to put in place institutional arrangements which reflect
   the most appropriate mix of incentive-based and regulatory mechanisms
   for water management.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport experiments are often conducted with homogeneous soils,
   whereas transport in real situations takes place in heterogeneous soils.
   An experiment was conducted to compare unsaturated solute transport
   through uniform and layered soils. Pulse inputs of tritiated water,
   bromide and chloride were applied under steady flow conditions to the
   tops of two large (0.95 m diameter by 6 m deep) soil columns. One column
   was uniformly filled with loamy fine sand and the other filled with
   alternating 20-cm-thick layers of loamy fine sand and silty clay loam.
   Soil solution samples were collected during the experiment with suction
   candles installed at various depths in the columns. Solute transport
   parameters were estimated by fitting the convection-dispersion equation
   to the observed breakthrough curves for each solute at various depths in
   each column. The match between the resulting calibrated curves and the
   experiment was better for the layered soil column than for the uniform
   soil column. The results displayed no clear relationship between the
   dispersion coefficients and depth for any of the tracers for either
   column. However, dispersivities were greater in the uniform column (3.5
   cm) than in the layered column (1.2 cm), while retardation factors for
   bromide and chloride were similar (0.8 and 0.83, respectively, for the
   uniform and layered columns). A retardation factor less than one is
   attributed to anion exclusion. There was evidence of preferential flow
   in the uniform soil column. The peak concentrations at 5 m depth were
   greater than those observed at 4 m. Such behavior is inconsistent with
   one-dimensional flow. Similar results were observed in an experiment
   performed 3.5 years earlier using the same soil column and approximately
   the same flow rates, but using a different tracer and associated
   chemical analysis, different soil saturation prior to the execution of
   the experiment, and different experimental personnel. This supports the
   thesis that the anomalous behavior is due to some form of preferential
   flow rather than due to experimental error.}},

Abstract = {{In the water retention process in porous material, changes in water
   content are assumed to be independent of the rate at which the matric
   potential varies. Periodically, researchers have presented results that
   do not support this assumption, indicating that water retention may be
   rate-dependent under certain conditions. In the present study, long-term
   experiments were performed on five porous materials in which core
   samples were drained at different rates down to matric potentials of -50
   kPa. Comparisons of these results with previous results confirm that
   slight rate-dependent behavior occurs during drainage of porous
   materials in this matric potential range. Specifically, new and previous
   results indicate that on average 4-5\% more water was retained for a
   slow, multistep drainage versus a fast, one-step drainage treatment. For
   the present study, average results for individual materials were
   variable, ranging from a 1 to a 10\% difference in water content due to
   treatment. Several possible mechanisms for the observed rate-dependent
   behavior are discussed. The only plausible mechanism is related to
   variations in pore water salt concentrations that induce differences in
   the pore water surface tension for fast versus slow drainage. Regardless
   of the mechanism, results suggest that rate-dependent behavior during
   water retention may contribute to an enhanced temperature dependence of
   water retention, due to higher rates of water redistribution at higher
   temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A new technique, called the mixed-integer-chance-constrained programming
   (MICCP) method is developed in this research. This technique considers
   uncertainty in all linear programming constraint coefficients and does
   not require a priori knowledge of the distribution. A groundwater
   remediation problem serves as an example. The method is developed to
   find the globally optimal trade-off curve for maximum reliability versus
   a minimum pumping objective. As the fields became more heterogeneous,
   the pumping rate of a reliable solution increases. Four simple `'rule of
   thumb'' methods are compared to the MICCP technique. In general, the
   performance of such methods decreases as the heterogeneity of the
   hydraulic conductivity field increases.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty due to spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity is an
   important issue in the design of reliable groundwater remediation
   strategies. Using groundwater management models based on a stochastic
   approach to groundwater flow, where the log-hydraulic conductivity is
   represented as a random field, is a frequently studied technique for the
   design of aquifer remediation in the presence of uncertainty. Such an
   approach employs the solution of a management model for a large set of
   equally probable realizations of the hydraulic conductivity. However,
   only a few out of the large set of realizations are critical to the
   final outcome of the design. The spatial distribution of the hydraulic
   conductivity values in a realization, and the degree of variation of the
   hydraulic conductivity values within a realization are identified as two
   important features that determine the level of criticalness of a
   realization. The association between the hydraulic conductivity pattern
   and the level of criticalness is not known explicitly and needs to be
   captured for efficient screening. The screening approach presented here
   utilizes the pattern classification capability of a neural network and
   its ability to learn from examples. It is shown that incorporation of
   only a few critical realizations in a groundwater management model can
   yield highly reliable remediation designs. The application of the
   screening tool in a pump-and-treat design problem is illustrated via two
   examples.}},

Abstract = {{A quasi-population model for adult brown trout was developed for the

   allows the population to be predicted under alternative flow management

   patterns were compared with the predicted population for the current
   reservoir operation regime. Changes in angler catch were imputed for
   these scenarios. The changes in catch were valued using estimates of
   willingness to pay obtained from anglers fishing at the site. Total
   angling effort was held constant. For both of the flow scenarios
   examined the difference in economic use value was limited. The
   relatively small changes in value predicted were shaped by the small
   changes in catch predicted and the high number of fish caught under

Abstract = {{In 1977 extensive data were collected to calibrate six Helley-Smith bed
   load samplers with four sediment particle sizes in a flume at the St.
   Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory at the University of Minnesota.
   Because sampler data cannot be collected at the same time and place as
   `'true'' trap measurements, the `'probability-matching method'' was used
   to derive surrogate pairs for calibration analysis. The method is
   invalid since it implicitly assumes that sampler and trap data have no
   sampling or measurement errors, it gives biased and highly variable
   results, and it does not contain information enabling model
   specification. A new calibration model was developed that regresses
   transformed individual sampler measurements on daily means of
   transformed trap data and incorporates within-day variation in trap
   rates to explain part of the sampler variation. Three small-nozzle
   samplers performed more uniformly than three large-nozzle samplers did.
   There is evidence that samplers with higher nozzle ratios collect more
   bed load in most particle size classes tested. However, between the two
   small-nozzle samplers with ratios of 3.22 and 1.40, significant
   differences could be detected for only one particle size. The standard
   sampler with a 76 x 76 mm nozzle trapped sediment less efficiently than
   a similar sampler with a 152 x 152 mm nozzle in three of four particle
   sizes tested. Limitations in the data restricted more definitive
   statements about the samplers, but the results of this study can be used
   to design a more rigorous calibration experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The data set obtained during the First International Satellite Land
   Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) allowed an
   assessment of several expressions originally proposed to estimate daily
   downward longwave radiation R(ld) under clear sky. These expressions
   with the original values of the constants were found to yield
   instantaneous R(ld) values with a standard error of estimate of the
   order of 10-20 W m-2, but with some bias, when applied to the
   instantaneous values of the input data set obtained under clear sky.
   Calibration of the constants for the FIFE area and for the instantaneous
   R(ld) estimation under clear sky improved the results with a standard
   error smaller than 10 W m-2 and practically without bias. Inclusion of
   the cloudiness and cloud type information into the formulation allowed
   the expansion of its usage for both clear and cloudy sky conditions; the
   resulting standard error of the R(ld) estimate was found to be around
   15-17 W m-2 if only the cloudiness data were utilized, and around 12 W
   m-2 if both cloudiness and cloud types were considered. These results
   were some 5 and 10 W m-2, respectively, better than the error in the
   estimation of R(ld) without cloudiness information.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the advection and diffusion of contaminants in
   tidal waters. The analysis starts with the well-known vertically
   integrated advection-diffusion equation. In order to derive a tidally
   averaged model to describe the advection and dispersion processes over
   long periods and to gain insight into the tidally induced dispersion, a
   new method to average the tide is introduced. Here it is assumed that
   both the dispersion coefficient and the residual flow are sufficiently
   small. The averaging procedure is derived by using a random walk model
   to describe the dispersion process. This random walk model is shown to
   be exactly consistent with the advection-diffusion equation. The
   averaging procedure results in equations for the averaged advective
   transport as well as equations for the effective dispersion tensor
   describing the mixing process that occurs within one tidal cycle. By
   using a numerical model to determine the tidal movement over one tidal
   cycle, the tidally averaged advective transport and dispersion tensor in
   each grid point of the model is approximated numerically. In this way a
   tidally induced dispersion map of the area under study is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of spatial variations in soil hydraulic properties and in
   water uptake by plant roots on the spatial distribution of matric
   potential (psi) and saturation (S) were investigated. A
   stochastic-analytic model for one-dimensional steady state unsaturated
   flow including water uptake by plant roots was developed and tested. The
   model is based on the small-perturbation approximation in two soil
   parameters characterizing the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and
   water retention, and a plant-rooting depth parameter. The soil is
   considered as made of decoupled soil columns with different properties.
   The model provides closed-form expressions for the spatial moments of
   soil water matric potential and saturation using statistical information
   on the soil properties and plant attributes as input. The proposed model
   favorably compared with Monte Carlo simulations using synthetically
   generated random fields of soil properties and plant-rooting depth. The
   results indicate that (1) there is a region above the water table where
   the variances of psi and S undergo a sharp decrease from their
   stationary values to zero at the water table; (2) for a small enough
   steady surface flux this transitional region can occupy the entire
   unsaturated zone; (3) water uptake by plant roots skews both the means
   and the variance profiles of psi and S such that they may never attain
   stationarity; and (4) the saturation variance profile is extremely
   sensitive to variations in psi due to the nonlinear relationship between
   psi and S.}},

Abstract = {{A unified Eulerian-Lagrangian theory is presented for the transport of a
   conservative solute in a random velocity field that satisfies locally
   del . v(x, t) = f(x, t), where f(x, t) is a random function including
   sources and/or the time derivative of head. Solute concentration
   satisfies locally the Eulerian equation partial derivative c(x,
   t)/partial derivative t + del . J(x, t) = g(x, t), where J(x, t) is
   advective solute flux and g(x, t) is a random source independent of f(x,
   t). We consider the prediction of c(x, t) and J(x, t) by means of their
   unbiased ensemble moments {[}c(x, t)]nu, and {[}J(x, t)]nu conditioned
   (as implied by the subscript) on local hydraulic measurements through
   the use of the latter in obtaining a relatively smooth unbiased estimate
   nu(x, t) of v(x, t). These predictors satisfy partial derivative {[}c(x,
   t)]nu/partial derivative t + del.{[}J(x, t)]nu = {[}g(x, t)]nu, where
   {[}J(x, t)]nu = nu(x, t){[}c(x, t)]nu + Q(nu)(x, t) and Q(nu)(x, t) is a
   dispersive flux. We show that Q, is given exactly by three space-time
   convolution integrals of conditional Lagrangian kernels alpha(nu) with
   del.Q(nu) beta, with del{[}c]nu and gamma(nu) with {[}c]nu for a broad
   class of v(x, t) fields, including fractals. This implies that Q(nu)(x,
   t) is generally nonlocal and non-Fickian, rendering {[}c(x, t)]nu
   non-Gaussian. The direct contribution of random variations in f to Q(nu)
   depends on {[}c]nu rather than on del{[}c]nu. We elucidate the nature of
   the above kernels; discuss conditions under which the convolution of
   beta(nu) and del{[}c] becomes pseudo-Fickian, with a Lagrangian
   dispersion tensor similar to that derived in 1921 by Taylor; recall a
   1952 result by Batchelor which yields an exact expression for (c), at
   early time; use the latter to conclude that linearizations which predict
   that (c), bifurcates at early time when the probability density function
   of v is unimodal cannot be correct; propose instead a weak approximation
   which leads to a nonlinear integro-differential equation for (c), due to
   an instantaneous point source and which improves with the quantity and
   quality of hydraulic data; demonstrate that the weak approximation is
   analogous to the `'direct interaction'' closure of turbulence theory;
   offer non-Fickian and pseudo-Fickian weak approximations for the second
   conditional moment of the concentration prediction error; demonstrate
   that it yields the so-called `'two-particle covariance'' as a special
   case; conclude that the (conditional) variance of c does not become
   infinite merely as a consequence of disregarding local dispersion; and
   discuss how to estimate explicitly the cumulative release of a
   contaminant across a `'compliance surface'' together with the associated
   estimation error.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon dioxide concentrations were measured at various depths and times
   in the unsaturated zones of two hydraulically and geochemically
   contrasting field sites, one in southeastern Washington state, and the
   other in south central Saskatchewan. In situ CO2 production rates were
   calculated from a mass balance that accounted for diffusive fluxes and
   partitioning of CO2 into an advecting aqueous phase. Production rates
   were compared with (1) microbial abundance and (2) subsurface
   temperature to determine whether subsurface CO2 production rates could
   be expressed as a simple function of these two variables. At the
   Washington site, subsurface production was successfully expressed as a
   function of microbial abundance and temperature for a large portion of
   the year, but not near the end of the growing season. Although
   subsurface microbes and organic carbon were more abundant at the
   Saskatchewan site, subsurface CO2 production rates were generally
   several orders of magnitude lower than at the Washington site, and no
   correlation could be established between microbial numbers, temperature,
   and production rate. The cases where production rates could not be
   expressed as a function of microbial numbers and temperature suggested
   conditions in which some other factor, such as nutrient limitations, was
   controlling.}},

Abstract = {{A reliability approach for probabilistic modeling of reactive transport
   in porous media provides two important quantitative results: (1) an
   estimate of the probability that dimensionless concentration equals or
   exceeds some specified level and (2) a probabilistic sensitivity measure
   which quantifies the relative importance of each uncertain variable with
   respect to the probabilistic outcome. The approach is potentially
   attractive because it can provide both a probability estimate and
   probabilistic sensitivity measures; this is especially important for
   relatively low probability events where Monte Carlo simulation may
   require hundreds of thousands of realizations for reasonable results.
   The reliability method can incorporate marginal probability distribution
   functions (PDF) and correlation between uncertain variables, and the
   general method can be used with existing analytical or numerical
   solutions. However, a first-order reliability approach provides only an
   approximate probability measure; the accuracy is a function of
   performance criterion and statistical characteristics of the uncertain
   variables. The methodology and results here focus on probabilistic
   sensitivity measures which indicate the importance of any uncertain
   variable to the probabilistic outcome. In this work, one-dimensional
   reactive transport is investigated with the following uncertain
   variables: groundwater flow velocity, diffusion coefficient,
   dispersivity, distribution coefficient, porosity, and bulk density. We
   examine how probabilistic outcome and sensitivity are influenced by
   choice of marginal PDF, correlation, and magnitude of uncertainty for
   the variables. We also compare the probabilistic sensitivity results to
   typical deterministic sensitivity measures. Results indicate that the
   probabilistic outcome is most sensitive to likely changes in flow
   velocity and the reaction terms. Diffusion coefficient can also be an
   important uncertain variable but only when it has significantly higher
   uncertainty (coefficient of variation) than any other variable. For some
   cases shown in this paper, dispersivity and diffusion coefficient can be
   treated as deterministic variables with little impact on the
   probabilistic outcome.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale natural gradient dispersion experiment was carried out in
   a sandy aquifer in the western part of Denmark using tritium and
   chloride as tracers. For both plumes a marked spreading was observed in
   the longitudinal direction while the spreading in the transverse
   horizontal and transverse vertical directions was very small. The
   horizontal transport parameters of the advection-dispersion equation
   were investigated by applying an optimization model to observed
   breakthrough curves of tritium representing depth averaged
   concentrations. No clear trend in dispersion parameters with travel
   distance for distances between 50 and 200 m could be found, suggesting
   that the asymptotic stage was reached within a short distance from the
   point of injection. A three-dimensional numerical model for flow and
   transport was applied to the aquifer in order to quantify the
   dispersivity parameters more closely. The following `'best fit''
   dispersivity parameters were identified: longitudinal horizontal, 0.45
   m; transverse horizontal, 0.001 m; and transverse vertical, 0.0005 m.}},

Abstract = {{One method of reducing the contamination of overland flow by soil
   chemicals (e.g., nutrients, pesticides) is to reduce their concentration
   at the immediate soil surface. This can be done by incorporating the
   chemicals at lower depths, by either tilling the soil or by irrigating
   shortly after chemical application. A mathematical model designed to
   predict the runoff concentration of chemicals initially located at
   different depths below the soil surface is presented. The model accounts
   for transient water infiltration and convective-dispersive solute
   transport in the soil, and also considers rate-limited mass transfer
   through a laminar boundary layer at the soil surface/runoff water
   interface. Sorption-desorption interactions between soil and chemicals
   are assumed to be subject to linear isotherms or to first-order
   kinetics. The dissolved chemical concentrations at the soil surface and
   in the surface runoff were simulated for coarse and fine soils at
   different antecedent soil moistures and rainfall intensities. The
   simulation indicated that the initial depth of chemical incorporation
   below the soil surface is negatively correlated to the dissolved
   chemical concentration at the soil surface and in runoff water. A basic
   and characteristic difference between the chemical whose retention by
   the soil solids is expressed by an equilibrium model and the one whose
   retention is expressed by a kinetic model is soil surface concentration
   during water and chemical redistribution following the termination of
   rainfall and runoff. Contrary to the instantaneous equilibrium-type
   chemicals, the dissolved concentration of the kinetic-type chemicals
   increases sharply to its final value. For the coarser soil with higher
   saturated hydraulic conductivity, the relative chemical concentrations
   in surface runoff are lower than for the finer soil, when similar values
   of initial pressure head psi0 and rainfall intensities (three times the
   saturated hydraulic conductivity of each soil) are used.}},

Abstract = {{The results of experimental and analytical investigations of the
   movement of lighter than water organic liquids in the vadose zone are
   presented. The experiments consisted of physical model tests simulating
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) spills in unsaturated, two-dimensional
   domain above the water table. The evolution of the plume was observed
   through the transparent side of a tank containing sand, and the
   contaminant front was traced at appropriate intervals. Visual
   observations were supplemented with pressure and saturation measurements
   suitable for quantitative analysis of the process. The experiments show
   that during infiltration the front advances at constant speed
   (area/time). After spreading comes to a halt, the bulk of the
   contaminant is contained within a pancake-shaped lens situated on top of
   the capillary fringe. Fluctuations of the phreatic surface result in
   trapping the NAPL below the water table and in spreading the contaminant
   over a larger area. In layered samples, the behavior is largely geometry
   dependent, although heterogeneities invariably result in extensive
   horizontal spreading. Simplified analytical relationships were developed
   to estimate the spreading rate of the contaminant during infiltration
   and the thickness of the final immobilized oil lens observed during the
   experiments. These relationships are based on capillary pressure
   considerations, which have to be included in order to model the
   immobilization of the plume at saturations higher than the residual
   values, which typically occur in vadose zone, when the NAPL encounters
   the capillary fringe in its downward migration.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of concentration waves of solutes affected by nonlinear
   sorption, precipitation/dissolution and homogeneous reactions in the
   mobile and stationary phases are established when the number of phases
   is constant. These properties essentially depend on the structure of a
   stoichiometric matrix which describes the chemical interactions. A
   reduction procedure of the stoichiometric matrix gives the number of
   waves or peaks together with their propagation velocities, and the
   retardation factors of species at trace levels. The location of the
   peaks and their broadening behavior due to the nonlinear equilibria are
   estimated. The number of waves and the properties of suitable linear
   combinations of concentrations provide a method for discriminating among
   rival interaction mechanisms irrespective of the equilibrium constants.
   This cannot be done using conventional methods based on the comparison
   between numerical simulations and experimental curves.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical properties of breakthrough curves (BTCs) of solutes subject
   to nonlinear sorption, precipitation/dissolution and homogeneous
   reactions are compared with numerical simulations. The example treated
   here involves heterovalent ion exchange on clays, ionization of carbonic
   acid and water, and dissolution of gaseous carbon dioxide and of solid
   calcite. Despite the complexity of the solid-fluid interaction mechanism
   (13 reacting species and six reactions), the number of waves, the
   possible existence of an unretarded wave, and the expressions for the
   concentrations of the stoichiometric tracers are easily derived from the
   stoichiometric matrix. The location of peaks or waves and their
   broadening characteristics due to the nonlinear equilibria are estimated
   exclusively from the compositions of the injected and initial solutions.
   All of these theoretical properties are confirmed by numerical
   simulations, even in the presence of dispersion. The number of waves and
   the stoichiometric tracers are shown to depend on whether or not the
   pore solution equilibrates with a gas phase. This property illustrates
   the strong sensitivity of the breakthrough curves to the interaction
   mechanism. Finally, calculating the BTCs of the stoichiometric tracers
   from the experimental BTCs of the liquid phase species allows one to
   discriminate among rival interaction mechanisms without requiring a
   numerical model and knowledge of the equilibrium constants.}},

Abstract = {{The relative roles of base flow runoff versus storm flow runoff versus
   subsurface outflow in controlling total export of solutes from a 23.4-ha
   catchment of undisturbed rain forest in the central Amazon Basin were
   evaluated from water and solute flux measurements performed over a 1
   year period. Solutes exported via 173 storms during the study were
   estimated from stream water samples collected during base flow
   conditions and during eight storms, and by utilizing a hydrograph
   separation technique in combination with a mixing model to partition
   storm flow from base flow fluxes. Solutes exported by subsurface outflow
   were estimated from groundwater samples from three nests of piezometers
   installed into the streambed, and concurrent measurements of hydraulic
   conductivity and hydraulic head gradients. Base flow discharge
   represented 92\% of water outflow from the basin and was the dominant
   pathway of solute export. Although storm flow discharge represented only
   5\% of total water outflow, storm flow solute fluxes represented up to
   25\% of the total annual export flux, though for many solutes the
   portion was less. Subsurface outflow represented only 2.5\% of total
   water outflow, and subsurface solute fluxes never represented more than
   5\% of the total annual export flux. Measurement errors were relatively
   high for storm flow and subsurface outflow fluxes, but cumulative
   measurement errors associated with the total solute fluxes exported from
   the catchment, in most cases, ranged from only +/-7\% to 14\% because
   base flow fluxes were measured relatively well. The export fluxes of
   most solutes are substantially less than previously reported for
   comparable small catchments in the Amazon basin, and these differences
   cannot be reconciled by the fact that storm flow and subsurface outflows
   were not appropriately measured in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{The water balance and hydrologic characteristics of streamflow and
   subsurface outflow were measured for a first-order catchment draining a
   23.4-ha stand of undisturbed terra firme rain forest in the central
   Amazon Basin over a 1 year period. Total rainfall during the study
   period, representing a 1 in 10 wet year, was 2870 mm of which 1650 mm
   and 42 mm respectively were exported from the catchment as streamflow
   and subsurface outflow. A hydrograph separation technique applied to the
   entire streamflow record distinguished 173 storms. The storm flow volume
   was 88 mm, which represented only 5\% of overall streamflow and less
   than 3\% of the rainfall. The 20\% of least frequent. large-volume
   storms accounted for 75\% of the rainfall volume and 80\% of the storm
   flow volume. The fraction of the catchment that could account for the
   volume of storm flow runoff in a given storm as overland flow never
   exceeded 4\%, even for the largest storms. The change in soil water
   storage from the previous year was equivalent to about 57 mm of water.
   Evapotranspiration, estimated as the water balance residual, was
   equivalent to 1120 mm per year with an uncertainty, estimated by
   propagating measurement errors, of +/- 16-21\%. Evapotranspiration is
   significantly less than values previously reported from catchment-scale
   water balance studies in the central Amazon, and is slightly lower than
   recent estimates derived from micrometeorological techniques, though
   differences in the latter case are within measurement error.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the transport of groundwater contamination leads generally to
   problems wherein the continuity equation is coupled with the contaminant
   transport equation and Darcy's law. Such a system of equations is called
   the flow-transport system and is difficult to solve numerically. An
   optimal control, H-1, least squares formulation, associated with a
   conjugate gradient algorithm, is proposed for solving the coupled flow
   and transport problem. At each time step, each discretized differential
   equation is transformed into an optimal control problem. This problem is
   then stated as an equivalent minimization problem. The objective
   function associated with the transport problem is chosen in such a way
   that it accurately represents the advective behavior of the equation for
   high values of the Peclet number. The Nazareth version of the conjugate
   gradient method is used for solving the problem iteratively. At each
   iteration, only the fight-hand side of the equation is changed. Thus,
   the approach is attractive when large-scale problems must be solved.
   Analysis of the preconditioning of the coefficient matrix provides
   insight into the behavior of this approach. Validation runs for a
   one-dimensional example show accurate results for a wide range of Peclet
   and Courant numbers.}},

   resource, the model reflects farms situated alternatively on high-,
   medium-, and low-priority irrigation ditches within the Alamosa-La Jara
   fiver system, each with and without supplemental pumping. Differences
   are found in optimum enterprise mixes, net returns, choice of cropping
   technology, level of marketings, and other characteristics in response
   to variations in the availability of irrigation water. Implications are

Abstract = {{In this paper, data from a 1991 survey of Georgia residents were used to
   study people's willingness to pay (WTP) for improvements in drinking
   water quality and people's perceptions of potential groundwater
   contamination. Results showed that 27\% of the respondents served by
   public water supplies rated drinking water quality as poor, and 23\%
   were uncertain about their drinking water quality. The contingent
   valuation method was used to estimate WTP using a checklist format. The
   median estimated WTP was \$5.49 per month above their current water
   bills for people on public systems and \$7.38 for those using private
   wells, after rejecting outliers and using the maximum likelihood method.
   The aggregate WTP for all of Georgia was estimated to be about \$111.5
   million per year for public water users and \$42.3 million per year for
   private well owners. This aggregate WTP can serve as an estimate of
   benefits to consumers from improvements in drinking water quality
   statewide.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the United States, reservoirs are managed for multiple uses,
   including hydropower, stream flow regulation, flood control, and
   recreation. Water level drawdowns for hydropower, stream flow
   regulation, and flood control often reduce the suitability of reservoirs
   for water-based recreation. The gain in aggregate economic use value of
   outdoor recreation under three alternative water level management
   scenarios was measured for four reservoirs in western North Carolina as
   part of an interagency policy analysis. Use values were estimated using
   a contingent valuation survey and expert panel data. The basic question
   addressed by this study was whether the value recreational users place
   on higher water levels held longer into the summer and fall is
   significantly greater than the value of using these reservoirs as they
   were managed at the time of this study. Maintaining high water levels
   for longer periods during the summer and fall was found to result in
   considerable gains in estimated recreational benefits. While not a
   primary objective of this study, having these estimates provided us an
   opportunity to compare increased recreational benefits with the value
   the Tennessee Valley Authority estimated for the reduced production of
   electricity that would result if the lakes were manages to hold
   reservoir levels higher, longer into the year.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution for the case of transient, pumping-induced
   drawdown in a nonuniform aquifer is presented. The nonuniform aquifer is
   conceptualized as a uniform matrix into which a disk of anomalous
   properties has been placed. The disk can be arbitrarily located with
   respect to the pumping well. This solution can be used to develop
   considerable insight concerning the nature of drawdown in nonuniform
   systems. Changes in drawdown are sensitive to the hydraulic properties
   of a discrete portion of an aquifer for a time of limited duration.
   After that time, it is virtually impossible to gain further information
   about those properties. The volume of the aquifer controlling a given
   increment of drawdown at an observation well increases greatly as the
   distance between the pumping and observation well increases. At
   observation wells located at moderate to large distances from the
   pumping well, this volume is so large that the effect of spatial
   variations in flow properties may be negligible. In general, drawdown
   data from wells located at a distance from the pumping well should
   nicely fit the ideal models of the well hydraulics literature. When
   combined with previous work, these results demonstrate that constant
   rate pumping tests are not an effective tool for characterizing lateral
   variations in flow properties.}},

Abstract = {{Regional frequency analysis uses data from a number of measuring sites.
   A `'region'' is a group of sites each of which is assumed to have data
   drawn from the same frequency distribution. The analysis involves the
   assignment of sites to regions, testing whether the proposed regions are
   indeed homogeneous, and choice of suitable distributions to fit to each
   region's data. This paper describes three statistics useful in regional
   frequency analysis: a discordancy measure, for identifying unusual sites
   in a region; a heterogeneity measure, for assessing whether a proposed
   region is homogeneous, and a goodness-of-fit measure, for assessing
   whether a candidate distribution provides an adequate fit to the data.
   Tests based on the statistics provide objective backing for the
   decisions involved in regional frequency analysis. The statistics are
   based on the L moments {[}Hosking, 1990] of the at-site data.}},

   HORIZONTAL GROUNDWATER VELOCITY-MEASUREMENTS IN A BOREHOLE}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new instrument for measuring groundwater
   velocity in a borehole using a laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV)
   technique. The major improvement of the proposed LDV system is that the
   probe can be inserted into a borehole that has a minimum diameter of 10
   cm and that a disk-type rotating grating is used as a frequency shifter
   for low velocities in order to determine the velocity sign. The speed of
   the glass plate passing through the LDV measurement point is calibrated
   to demonstrate the accuracy of the new LDV system. From a comparison
   with the true constant speed of the glass plate, we confirm that the new
   LDV system can measure low speeds in the range from 10(-5) to 10(-2)
   cm/s at a measurement error of less than 8\%. Laboratory experiments
   were carried out to investigate the performance of the new LDV system
   for the horizontal velocity measurement of groundwater in a borehole.
   The result obtained by the proposed LDV system shows that the horizontal
   velocity at the center of an unscreened borehole is 3 times larger than
   the seepage velocity in a confined aquifer. This result agrees with the
   theoretical solution for groundwater flow in a borehole derived by Sano
   (1983). The validity of the theoretical solution is experimentally
   verified in the laboratory using the current LDV system. Although the
   detectable minimum velocity in a borehole is limited by the velocity
   fluctuations due to the Brownian motion of scattering particles, results
   obtained in the experiments using 0.804-mum polystyrene particles show
   that the LDV system described in this paper can measure with a
   sufficient accuracy both the magnitude and the direction of groundwater
   velocity down to 10(-4) cm/s in a borehole.}},

Title = {{SPRING CLIMATE AND SALINITY IN THE SAN-FRANCISCO BAY ESTUARY}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{293-303}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Salinity in the San Francisco Bay Estuary almost always experiences its
   yearly maximum during late summer, but climate variability produces
   marked interannual variations. The atmospheric circulation pattern
   impacts the estuary primarily through variations of runoff from rainfall
   and snowmelt from the Sierra Nevada and, secondarily, through variations
   in the near-surface salinity in the coastal ocean. While winter
   precipitation is the primary influence upon salinity in the estuary,
   spring climate variations also contribute importantly to salinity
   fluctuations. Spring atmospheric circulation influences both the
   magnitude and the timing of freshwater flows, through anomalies of
   precipitation and temperature. To help discriminate between the effects
   of these two influences, the record is divided into subsets according to
   whether spring conditions in the region are cool and wet, warm and wet,
   cool and dry, or warm and dry. Warm springs promote early
   snowmelt-driven flows, and cool springs result in delayed flows. In
   addition to effects of winter and spring climate variability operating
   on the watershed, there are more subtle effects that are transmitted
   into the estuary from the coastal ocean. These influences are most
   pronounced in cool and dry springs with high surface salinity (SS) in
   the coastal ocean versus cool and wet springs with low SS in the coastal
   ocean. A transect of SS records at stations from the mouth to the head
   of the bay suggests that the coastal ocean anomaly signal is attenuated
   from the mouth to the interior of the estuary. In contrast, a delayed,
   postsummer signal caused by winter and spring runoff variations from the
   upstream watershed are most pronounced at the head of the estuary and
   attenuate toward the mouth.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional dual-porosity model has been developed for the purpose
   of studying variably saturated water flow and solute transport in
   structured soils or fractured rocks. The model involves two overlaying
   continua at the macroscopic level: a macropore or fracture pore system
   and a less permeable matrix pore system. Water in both pore systems is
   assumed to be mobile. Variably saturated water flow in the matrix as
   well as in the fracture pore system is described with the Richards'
   equation, and solute transport is described with the
   convection-dispersion equation. Transfer of water and solutes between
   the two pore regions is simulated by means of first-order rate
   equations. The mass transfer term for solute transport includes both
   convective and diffusive components. The formulation leads to two
   coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations which were
   solved numerically using the Galerkin finite element method. Simulation
   results demonstrate the complicated nature of solute leaching in
   structured, unsaturated porous media during transient water flow.
   Sensitivity studies show the importance of having accurate estimates of
   the hydraulic conductivity near the surface of soil aggregates or rock
   matrix blocks. The proposed model is capable of simulating preferential
   flow situations using parameters which can be related to physical and
   chemical properties of the medium.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simultaneous solution algorithm for
   one-dimensional unsteady flow routing through channel networks. This
   direct solution algorithm is based on the double-sweep method and
   utilizes separate recursion equations for continuity, momentum and
   energy equations for each of the individual components of channel
   networks. Through separate recursion equations for each of the
   components, the new algorithm converts the channel network problem into
   a single-channel problem. The new algorithm is utilized in conjunction
   with a linearized unsteady flow model using full dynamic flow equations.
   The required computer storage for the coefficient matrix of the whole
   system is reduced significantly from the 2N x 2N matrix to a 2N x 4
   matrix, where N is the number of cross sections used in the computation
   of flow variables in the channel network. The algorithm presented in
   this paper provides an efficient and accurate modeling of unsteady flow
   events through channel networks.}},

Abstract = {{The framework of the present study is the development of a new approach
   to describe the displacement of fresh water by salt water in a layered
   coastal aquifer. The aquifer is composed of horizontal layers possessing
   different hydraulic conductivities, which are also different in the
   saltwater and the freshwater zones. A one-dimensional analysis is
   performed, describing the displacement of the saltwater-freshwater
   interface under the influence of freshwater flow toward the sea. Several
   analytical solutions are found revealing the effects of various
   parameters on the interface displacement process. On the basis of these
   solutions, several type curves for different freshwater saltwater
   hydraulic conductivity are drawn. The model is calibrated by matching a
   type curve with field data taken from an observation well and is further
   used to predict the evolution of the interface shape and position.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the effect of measuring randomly varying local hydraulic
   conductivities K(x) on one's ability to predict steady state flow within
   a bounded domain, driven by random source and boundary functions. More
   precisely, we consider the prediction of local hydraulic head h(x) and
   Darcy flux q(x) by means of their unbiased ensemble moments (h(x))kappa
   and (q(x))kappa conditioned on measurements of K(x). These predictors
   satisfy a deterministic flow equation in which (q(x))kappa =  - kappa(x)
   del (h(x))kappa + r(kappa)(x), where kappa(x) is a relatively smooth
   unbiased estimate of K(x) and r(kappa)(X) is a `'residual flux.'' We
   derive a compact integral expression for r(kappa)(x) which is rigorously
   valid for a broad class of K(x) fields, including fractals. It
   demonstrates that (q(x))kappa is nonlocal and non-Darcian so that an
   effective hydraulic conductivity does not generally exist. We show
   analytically that under uniform mean flow the effective conductivity may
   be a scalar, a symmetric or a nonsymmetric tensor, or a set of
   directional scalars which do not form a tensor. We demonstrate
   numerically that in two-dimensional mean radial flow it may increase
   from the harmonic mean of K(x) near interior and boundary sources to the
   geometric mean far from such sources. For cases where r(kappa)(x) can
   neither be expressed nor approximated by a local expression, we propose
   a weak (integral) approximation (closure) which appears to work well in
   media with pronounced heterogeneity and improves as the quantity and
   quality of K(x) measurements increase. The nonlocal deterministic flow
   equation can be solved numerically by standard methods; our theory shows
   clearly how the scale of grid discretization should relate to the scale,
   quantity, and quality of available data. After providing explicit
   approximations for the second moments of bead and flux prediction
   errors, we conclude by discussing practical methods to compute kappa(x)
   from noisy measurements of K(x) and to calculate required second moments
   of the associated estimation errors when K(x) is lognormal.}},

Abstract = {{Enormous amounts of hydrologic data are required to accurately simulate
   subsurface contaminant transport. Effectively supplementing measurements
   of hydrologic parameters such as permeability and porosity with `'soft''
   information obtained from the interpretation of geologic cores and
   geophysical logs can improve the simulation of contaminant transport
   while reducing the measured data that are required. A method is
   presented herein for generating hydraulic conductivity fields comprised
   of several geological materials with hydraulic conductivities that can
   range over several orders of magnitude. This method utilizes indicator
   fields that are designed to allow random variation at the megascopic
   scale but are constrained by observations inferred from geophysical logs
   and geologic core data, The statistical description of random hydraulic
   conductivity values of distinct geological materials at the macroscopic
   scale may be obtained by conventional parameter estimation techniques.
   The combined approach can then be used to generate realizations of a
   hydraulic conductivity field for subsequent use in flow and transport
   simulations. The structural constraints confine realizations to vary
   about a nominal model in a physically reasonable manner. The uncertainty
   may be viewed as arising from two different scales. Variation in
   hydraulic conductivity at the macroscale may be viewed as an intrinsic
   statistical property of the particular geologic material but where
   measurements may be made in order to ascertain the statistical
   description. On the other hand, uncertainty at the megascale level
   arises from the fact that the large-scale system structure is only
   partially observable. It is the latter area where soft geologic
   information and geological knowledge can be useful in confining the
   uncertainty in the model to geologically reasonable limits.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling water movement in the unsaturated zone requires a great number
   of parameters, such as the initial water content, the saturated moisture
   content, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity, which can relatively
   easily be assessed. Other functions such as the suction head and the
   relative hydraulic conductivity, which are highly nonlinear functions of
   the actual water content are more difficult to find. Furthermore,
   infiltration experiments carried out at a few locations can only define
   these parameters at selected locations, and a reasonable interpolation
   of these parameters is extremely difficult. In this paper, two fuzzy
   logic-based models are presented for the infiltration process. Basic
   definitions of fuzzy sets are given, and basic operations are explained.
   Principles of the rule-based infiltration models are presented. The
   rules for the first model are based on the moisture content of the
   adjacent layers and the depth of the wetting front. Using these rules,
   the flows can be calculated as exact quantities. The rules are derived
   from a training set which was obtained from several test runs of a Green
   and Ampt (GA) infiltration model. Separate rules are derived for the
   flow dynamics in the upper layer (runoff and infiltration), and for
   water flow between the layers. Examples of the application of the model
   are given. The model performs with similar accuracy as the GA model,
   using only 40\% of its parameters and running 2 orders of magnitude
   faster. A training set obtained by numerical solution of the Richards
   equation was used to create a second fuzzy rule-based model. Here the
   rules are based on the moisture content of the adjacent layers. Results
   obtained by the use of the models are compared with measured values,
   showing a very accurate reproduction of the values.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A framework for the prediction of solute spread in partially saturated
   heterogeneous porous formation is presented by combining a general
   Lagrangian formulation, relating the spatial moments of the solute body
   to the velocity field, with the stochastic theory of Yeh et al. (1985a,
   b) for steady unsaturated flow, relating the statistical moments of the
   velocity field to properties of the heterogenous formation. The relevant
   formation properties are log saturated conductivity, log K(s) and the
   pore size distribution parameter, alpha, which, in turn, are viewed as
   independent, random spatial functions. First-order approximations of the
   longitudinal and transverse components of the velocity covariance
   function are derived for unidirectional, vertical mean flow in partially
   saturated, heterogeneous porous formations of three-dimensional
   structure. Neglecting pore scale dispersion, and by using basic,
   kinematical relationships to relate the displacement to the velocity
   field, the effect of mean water saturation, and of statistical
   parameters of porous formation properties on longitudingal and
   transverse components of the time-dependent displacement covariance
   tensor X, is evaluated. Results of the analyses show that solute spread
   increases as water saturation decreases. In the case where the
   correlation scale of a was small, as compared with that of log K(s),
   however, the longitudinal component of X is essentially robust to water
   saturation, suggesting that in this case, vadose zone transport might be
   amenable to an analysis similar to that for saturated groundwater
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{We solve the Newtonian equations of motion to follow the trajectories of
   each of a large number of two-dimensional circular bed load particles as
   they move in response to stresses exerted by an overlying fluid. The
   fluid is modeled as a moving layer or `'slab'' which exerts a
   velocity-dependent drag force on embedded particles and satisfies its
   own momentum balance equation. Bed load mass flux and hop length and hop
   height statistics of simulated beds resemble those observed in the
   laboratory. By marking particles originally residing on the surface,
   vertical mixing of sediment is investigated. An injection of fine
   particles into a bed load system of coarse particles under traction
   illustrates the early stages of the evolution of sedimentary
   stratigraphy. Friction angles and their distribution are investigated as
   a function of bed transport history and particle size. The main thrust
   of the paper, however, is to describe and test a microscopic bed load
   model which engineers, geologists, and biologists may find useful for
   applications where particle arrangement and relative particle motion are
   important.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and efficient method for flow routing, combining the kinematic
   wave equation with a statistical procedure, is introduced. It accounts
   for the nonlinearity and the dispersion of the flood wave propagation
   phenomenon and for lateral flow. The method is flexible, because it can
   be used to simulate a variety of flow variables, for example, water
   stage or discharge. Its calibration is based on historical records at
   both ends of the reach, and does not require geometric cross-section or
   longitudinal data. An application to the White Nile in Sudan
   demonstrates the practicality and accuracy of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic analysis of flow and transport in the subsurface usually
   assumes that the soil permeability is a stationary, homogeneous
   stochastic process with a finite variance.  Some field data suggest,
   however. that the permeability distributions may have a fractal
   character with long-range correlations. It is of interest to investigate
   how the fractal character of permeability distribution influences the
   spreading and mixing process in porous media. The results of our
   analysis of this problem for perfectly stratified media with fractal
   distribution of permeability along the vertical are presented. Results
   were obtained for the transient and asymptotic dispersivities in the
   longitudinal direction. The results show that the macroscopic asymptotic
   dispersivity depends strongly on the fractal dimension of vertical
   permeability distribution. Specifically, the higher the fractal
   dimension, the lower the value of macroscopic dispersivity. The
   macroscopic dispersivity was found to be problem-scale dependent in
   transient (development) and asymptotic phases, Variance of fluctuation
   of concentration was also analyzed and found to be dependent on the
   fractal dimension. In this case, the higher fractal dimension results in
   more mixing of pore water and therefore smoother (smaller
   sigma(infinite)2) concentration distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A physically meaningful technique to determine the effective depth to
   the water table, as a measure of the initial storage capacity of a basin
   is developed. The estimation of the initial storage capacity prior to a
   given flood event is essential to obtain useful results from storm
   runoff prediction models based on saturation excess overland flow. It is
   shown how this effective depth to the water table can be related to
   streamflow measurements at the outlet of the basin. The analysis is
   based on Boussinesq's standard hydraulic groundwater theory. The main
   feature of the present formulation is that it allows the estimation of
   catchment-scale parameters, namely the aquifer hydraulic conductivity
   and the average depth to the impervious layer. The estimation of these
   parameters is based on a drought flow analysis which is consistent with
   the hydraulic groundwater theory used to develop the described
   technique. This hydraulic theory is found to be applicable for a
   catchment under humid temperate climatic conditions, namely the Zwalm
   catchment situated in East-Flanders, Belgium. The results of the
   proposed analysis are used to estimate the initial conditions in a
   partial area runoff generation model. It is shown that accurate
   estimates of total runoff volume are obtained without further
   calibration of the model.}},

Abstract = {{Regional information has proved to be particularly valuable for
   estimating the higher-order parameters of flood series distributions.
   This has suggested the use of a hierarchical approach for regional curve
   fitting, in which higher-order moment ratios, such as the coefficient of
   skewness and the coefficient of kurtosis, are estimated over larger
   areas than lower-order moment ratios, such as the coefficient of
   variation. This philosophy is applied here for the Pearson type III
   distribution and is combined with an empirical Bayes approach for the
   estimation of the scale parameter. This work is specifically aimed at
   estimating flood frequencies and quantiles at sites with short record
   lengths. Some simulation experiments are reported for an evaluation of
   the performance of the method, and an application on a set of 59
   Ontarian flood series having long record length plus two example
   stations with short record length is described for illustrative
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{A method of solution of the shallow water equations in their primitive
   form that yield solutions free of numerical oscillations, is presented.
   The method is based on the least squares collocation concept. The focus
   is on the accuracy of the solution procedure. Comparison of the
   numerical solution with analytic solutions for problems of irregular
   geometry are presented. Key features are the ability of the method to
   solve the equations in an irregular domain with a completely orthogonal
   computational mesh and the inherent nondissipative noise control of the
   temporal and spatial approximations.}},

Abstract = {{The boundary layer methods which have been used to describe wave
   propagation past obstacles in the regions of glancing incidence have
   particular relevance to the asymptotic treatment, for large s, of steady
   infiltration as modeled by Philip's quasi-linearization. Here s(=
   alphal/2) is defined as the ratio of the characteristic length l of the
   water supply surface (in fact, its radius) to the sorptive length
   2alpha-1 of the soil. In this paper the steady infiltration from surface
   sources which are either semicircular in cross section or hemispherical
   are considered. Unlike the cases of buried sources considered by
   Waechter and Philip (1985), where an exact solution is available, we do
   not have an exact solution here. However, we resolve the structure of
   the large s asymptotics using the advantages of the scattering analog
   with the elegance of boundary layer methods. In particular, we calculate
   the mean infiltration rates (4/pi)(1 + 0.6954s-2/3) and (1 +
   1.3909s-2/3) for trench and hemispherical pond respectively and compare
   these with those for the corresponding cases of buried sources. We also
   compare our dimensionless total flux for a trench with that for a
   shallow trench of Pullan and Collins (1987) and our dimensionless total
   flux for a hemispherical cavity with that for a large shallow pond of
   Weir (1986).}},

Abstract = {{Simulation is used to evualuate the future performance of water supply
   headworks systems. Typically, most of the uncertainties associated with
   the use of demand models are ignored in the simulation. A simulation
   methodology is presented which makes allowance for the uncertainties
   associated with the use of demand and streamflow models. The demand
   uncertainties considered are natural, climatic, socioeconomic, and model
   parameter uncertainty. The methodology is illustrated using two case
   studies which consider a simple stationary demand model and the widely
   used trend extrapolation demand model. The results show that ignoring
   demand uncertainties (as well as streamflow model parameter uncertainty)
   can significantly bias the expected reliability. This bias depends on
   the magnitude of demand uncertainty which in turn depends on model
   structure, length of data available for calibration, and uncertainty in
   future socioeconomic variables. Moreover, this bias tends to increase as
   streamflow variability decreases. To guard against overoptimistic
   assessment of system performance, it is suggested that allowance be made
   for demand uncertainty (as well as streamflow model parameter
   uncertainty) in headworks simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the CO2 concentration in the unsaturated zone is essential
   for prediction of solution chemistry in the vadose zone and groundwater
   recharge as well as for quantifying carbon source/sink terms as part of
   the global CO2 mass balance. In this paper we present a predictive
   simulation model, SOILCO2, based on process-oriented relationships. The
   model includes one-dimensional water flow and multiphase transport Of
   CO2 utilizing the Richards and the convection-dispersion equations,
   respectively, as well as heat flow and a CO2 production model. The
   transport of CO2 in the unsaturated zone can occur in both the liquid
   and gas phases. The gas transport equation accounts for production of
   CO2 and uptake of CO2 by plant roots associated with root water uptake.
   The CO2 production model considers both microbial and root respiration
   which is dependent on water content, temperature, growth, salinity and
   plant and soil characteristics. Heat flow is included, since some gas
   transport parameters, partitioning coefficients and production
   parameters are strongly temperature dependent. The resulting set of
   partial differential equations is solved numerically using the finite
   element and finite difference methods.}},

Abstract = {{In paper 1 of this two-paper series (Simunek and Suarez, this issue) we
   presented a description of the numerical model, SOILCO2, for CO2
   transport and production in the unsaturated zone. In paper 2 the model
   sensitivity to various parameters is evaluated by both steady state and
   transient simulations, with a range in the parameter values typically
   found under field conditions. We also select parameter values for
   optimal plant and microbial CO2 production and production dependence on
   temperature, water content, osmotic potential and gas composition for
   plant and microbial respiration, all based on literature review. The
   predictive capabilities of the SOILCO2 model are evaluated by comparing
   model simulations to published field data from Missouri for three
   different crops and two growing seasons under transient conditions as
   well as a data set collected in Riverside, California, under relatively
   constant water content at depth. The model provided good prediction of
   the CO2 flux to the atmosphere as well as the concentrations in the root
   zone for all data sets.}},

Abstract = {{The net work and energy flux at the boundaries of an aquifer change its
   internal energy and overcome its resistance to flow. In saturated porous
   media, the change in internal (strain) energy is stored in the elastic
   soil matrix and in pore water compression. In unsaturated media, an
   additional term accounts for changes in gravitational potential energy.
   The energy approach complements conventional insight by allowing
   spatially distributed processes to be integrated into energy and work
   terms which characterize a system's response to a set of excitations.
   Specifically, a technique is developed in this paper to interpret the
   dynamic behavior of a one-dimensional leaky aquifer in terms of its
   composite energy functions. In particular, the work interaction at the
   leaky boundary is used as an index of the significance of the leakage:
   when the work parameter indicates a relatively small leakage, the flow
   components of the multiaquifer can be isolated and modeled separately
   with a controllable loss of accuracy.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{A simple approach to indirectly address the inverse problem in steady
   state for aquifer transmissivity has been studied. The data on
   transmissivity and water level have simultaneously been used to produce
   the spatial distribution of transmissivity through cokriging. A simple
   relation between transmissivity and head was used to calculate coherent
   head covariance and head-transmissivity cross-covariance based on a
   chosen transmissivity covariance. Two theoretical aquifer models were
   studied: one with simple and almost parallel flow and the other with a
   complex flow and source terms. The results were compared with the
   theoretical values. The comparison shows that a better estimation both
   in terms of the estimated values of transmissivities and in terms of the
   standard deviation of the estimation errors is obtained when water
   levels combined with transmissivity are used than in case of the
   estimation with transmissivity alone, provided the groundwater flow
   direction in a close neighborhood of the estimation point is carefully
   calculated.}},

Abstract = {{Water Resource Council Bulletin 17B (Interagency Advisory Committee on
   Water Data, 1982) recommends finding T-year flood values by fitting
   stream gauge data with a log Pearson III distribution. A problem arising
   in using this method is that, as is well known, the estimator for the
   skew of this distribution is highly variable and the computed T-year
   values are sensitive to the value of skew used. The variability in
   estimating the skew is studied in this note by computing operating
   characteristic curves which display the probability that a sample from a
   site with a nonzero skew will actually fall in a specific interval. In
   rough summary it is not usually possible to reject, at a high level of
   significance the hypothesis that the skew at a site is zero by using
   only the data available for that site.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled formulation of withdrawal and sampling designs for groundwater
   supply models is presented. The withdrawal design is described as a
   discrete time optimal control problem and solved using a closed loop
   stochastic control (CLSC) method. Two main features of the CLSC method
   are the anticipation of the future observation program and decomposition
   of the objective function into the deterministic and stochastic part.
   The former characteristic indicates the necessity for coupling the
   withdrawal and sampling designs, while the later feature allows a
   decision maker to estimate the uncertainty in the objective function if
   certain withdrawal rates are applied. The sampling network is
   sequentially developed, with the design criterion defined as a
   sensitivity of the objective function stochastic part to the uncertainty
   in the hydraulic head distribution multiplied with the variance of the
   hydraulic head. The concept of minimizing the stochastic part of the
   objective function with respect to the hydraulic head uncertainty
   provides a convenient way to couple the withdrawal design objectives
   with the monitoring network development weighted with the magnitude of
   the prediction error in the hydraulic head distribution. The Bayesian
   concept of measurement conditioning is employed to sequentially adjust
   the withdrawal rates and sampling network development by accounting for
   the information conveyed in field observations. Between the sampling
   sessions the uncertainty in the hydraulic head prediction is evaluated
   using the first- and second-moment analysis applied to the discretized
   groundwater flow model. The uncertainty in the hydraulic head prediction
   is assumed to come from the natural uncertainty in the hydraulic
   conductivity and uncertainty in the boundary condition values and other
   external fluxes (e.g., leakages and recharge). A hypothetical example is
   included to demonstrate the application procedure and to illustrate the
   main features of the proposed coupled formulation.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is developed to efficiently compute exact Scheffe-type
   confidence intervals for output (or other function of parameters)
   g(beta) derived from a groundwater flow model. The method is general in
   that parameter uncertainty can be specified by any statistical
   distribution having a log probability density function (log pdf) that
   can be expanded in a Taylor series. However, for this study parameter
   uncertainty is specified by a statistical multivariate beta distribution
   that incorporates hydrogeologic information in the form of the
   investigator's best estimates of parameters and a grouping of random
   variables representing possible parameter values so that each group is
   defined by maximum and minimum bounds and an ordering according to
   increasing value. The new method forms the confidence intervals from
   maximum and minimum limits of g(beta) on a contour of a linear
   combination of (1) the quadratic form for the parameters used by Cooley
   and Vecchia (1987) and (2) the log pdf for the multivariate beta
   distribution. Three example problems are used to compare characteristics
   of the confidence intervals for hydraulic head obtained using different
   weights for the linear combination. Different weights generally produced
   similar confidence intervals, whereas the method of Cooley and Vecchia
   (1987) often produced much larger confidence intervals.}},

Abstract = {{Calibration data (observed values corresponding to model-computed values
   of dependent variables) are incorporated into a general method of
   computing exact Scheffe-type confidence intervals analogous to the
   confidence intervals developed in part 1 (Cooley, this issue) for a
   function of parameters derived from a groundwater flow model. Parameter
   uncertainty is specified by a distribution of parameters conditioned on
   the calibration data. This distribution was obtained as a posterior
   distribution by applying Bayes' theorem to the hydrogeologically derived
   prior distribution of parameters from part 1 and a distribution of
   differences between the calibration data and corresponding
   model-computed dependent variables. Tests show that the new confidence
   intervals can be much smaller than the intervals of part 1 because the
   prior parameter variance-covariance structure is altered so that
   combinations of parameters that give poor model fit to the data are
   unlikely. The confidence intervals of part 1 and the new confidence
   intervals can be effectively employed in a sequential method of model
   construction whereby new information is used to reduce confidence
   interval widths at each stage.}},

Abstract = {{A new numerical model for the fate and transport of nonconservative
   metals in an estuarine environment is introduced. ELAmet solves the
   depth-averaged advection/dispersion/transformation equation on a
   two-dimensional grid using a finite element formulation in an
   Eulerian-Lagrangian framework. The model incorporates aqueous speciation
   and adsorption/desorption. Adsorption to any number of solid types can
   take place through linear (partitioning) reactions or nonlinear
   (complexation) reactions. The model accommodates chemical equilibria and
   kinetics simultaneously. Rate constants can span any range of time
   scales, as the computational time step for solving the chemical
   transformation equations has been decoupled from that dictated by the
   circulation. Verification of the model is included for a one-dimensional
   channel and up to 15 chemical species. Preliminary applications are
   included which illustrate the concept of diagnostic modeling for a
   synthetic estuarine system in which the effects of source location,
   chemical kinetics, and sediment deposition on the mixing plot are
   examined.}},

Abstract = {{We used electrical resistance tomography (ERT) to map the subsurface
   distribution of a steam flood as a function of time as part of a
   prototype environmental restoration process performed by the Dynamic
   Underground Stripping Project. We evaluated the capability of ERT to
   monitor changes in the soil resistivity during the steam injection
   process using a dipole-dipole measurement technique to measure the bulk
   electrical resistivity distribution in the soil mass. The injected steam
   caused changes in the soil's resistivity because the steam displaced
   some of the native pore water, increased the pore water and soil
   temperatures and changed the ionic content of the pore water. We could
   detect the effects of steam invasion by mapping changes in the soil
   resistivity as a function of space and time. The ERT tomographs are
   compared with induction well logs, formation temperature logs and
   lithologic logs. These comparisons suggest that the ERT tomographs
   mapped the formation regions invaded by the steam flood. The data also
   suggest that steam invasion was limited in vertical extent to a gravel
   horizon at depth of approximately 43 m. The tomographs show that with
   time, the steam invasion zone extended laterally to all areas monitored
   by the ERT technique.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical hydrological simulation suggested that water exchange
   between stream channels and adjacent aquifers is enhanced by convexities
   and concavities in streambed topography. At St. Kevin Gulch, an effluent
   stream in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, subsurface hydraulic
   gradients and movement of ionic tracers indicated that stream water was
   locally recharged into well-defined flow paths through the alluvium.
   Stream water-filled flow paths in the alluvium (referred to as substream
   flow paths) returned to the stream a short distance downstream (1 to 10
   m). Recharge to the substream flow paths occurred where stream water
   slope increased, at the transition from pools (<1\%) to steeper channel
   units (5-20\%). Return of substream flow paths to the stream occurred
   where stream water slope decreased, at the transition from steeper
   channel units to pools. A net water flux calculation is typically used
   to characterize water and solute fluxes between surface and subsurface
   zones of catchments. Along our study reach at St. Kevin Gulch the net
   inflow of water from subsurface to stream (1.6 mL s-1 m-1)
   underestimated the gross inflow (2.7 mL s-1 m-1) by 40\%. The influence
   of streambed topography is to enhance hydrological fluxes between stream
   water and subsurface zones and to prolong water-sediment contact times;
   these effects could have important consequences for solute transport,
   retention. and transformation in catchments.}},

Abstract = {{A new single-borehole measurement technique for confined aquifers, the
   dipole flow test, yields the vertical distributions of the horizontal
   hydraulic conductivity, the vertical hydraulic conductivity, and the
   specific storativity when applied to different borehole intervals. The
   test utilizes straddle packers to isolate two chambers in the borehole,
   pressure transducers to monitor drawdown in them, and a small pump to
   create a dipole flow pattern in the aquifer by pumping water at a
   constant rate from the aquifer into one chamber, transferring it within
   the well to the next chamber, and finally injecting it back to the
   aquifer. A mathematical model describing the drawdown in each chamber is
   derived for the transient as well as the steady state cases. The aquifer
   parameters may be estimated from data produced by the dipole flow test
   alone or in conjunction with conventional pumping tests. The dipole flow
   regime reaches a steady state relatively quickly, especially in well
   permeable aquifers. A robust computational methodology for estimating
   the aquifer parameters, suitable for automatization, is based on the
   Newton-Raphson algorithm applied to a system of up to three nonlinear
   equations, each describing the well drawdown at a different judiciously
   chosen time. Due to the relatively small drawdown it invokes, the dipole
   flow test may be applicable to unconfined aquifers as well.}},

Abstract = {{The coefficients of diffusion for water vapor in snow and other porous
   media are fundamental parameters of great importance. While they are
   generally thought to be greater than the coefficient for air, there is
   much uncertainty about what value to use. Attempts to determine the
   diffusion coefficient in snow experimentally have led to contradictory
   results, but Yosida's experiments seem to give reasonable results.
   Yosida's idea of hand-to-hand diffusion is quantified here in a
   particle-to-particle model which shows that the diffusion coefficient
   depends on the mean pore size and that the coefficient in snow is four
   to seven times greater than in air.}},

Abstract = {{Reacting, nonlinearly adsorbing solute transport in chemically
   heterogeneous soils is studied. Assuming adsorption is adequately
   described with the Freundlich equation, random variation of the
   adsorption coefficient is assumed to describe the heterogeneity. In a
   homogeneous case, traveling wave fronts develop, characterized by a
   constant velocity and a constant front shape. Using the method of
   moments, an analytical expression is derived to describe the constant
   variance of the traveling wave front. Deviations from the analytical
   variance and velocity, both calculated with an average adsorption
   coefficient, show that column scale heterogeneity has significant
   effects on front spreading and front movement. Expected values of front
   velocity and variance are computed as averages of values of 600 randomly
   generated columns. The nonlinear process causes small deviations from
   the case with average parameters. The ensemble average concentration
   front, representing an average front for the flow domain, shows that
   three mechanisms are responsible for the front spreading. At early
   displacement times the front spreading is caused by the thickness of the
   individual traveling waves. Subsequently, the effect of the internal
   variation of the adsorption coefficient (column scale heterogeneity)
   increases, whereas at large displacement times the front spreading is
   dominated by the different retardation coefficients of the different
   columns. The latter effect causes the variance to increase in proportion
   to t2. An analytical approximation is derived for the ensemble average
   front, ignoring column scale heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{We present a relatively simple analytical/conceptual model for rainfall
   infiltration during complex storms. It is an approximate but physically
   based model which can treat intervals of either no rain, low rain, or
   evaporation. The infiltration model is based on the very general
   three-parameter analytic model of Parlange et al. (1982), extended to
   treat soils with very high initial water content. The redistribution
   model is based on profile extension with shape similarity. A wide range
   of soil types can be simulated. The model is tested by comparison with
   numerical solutions of Richards's equation carried out for a variety of
   events upon four selected soils. The model simulates the solution to
   Richards's equation quite accurately, provided basic soil retention
   relations are parametrically represented. It simulates redistribution
   particularly well for redistribution intervals up to 20 hours. The model
   usefulness in comparison with the common and simple approach which
   disregards soil water redistribution is also shown.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship of groundwater flow paths to the acid/base status and
   composition of groundwater was examined by directly monitoring
   groundwater inputs to an acidic Adirondack, New York, lake (Dart's
   Lake). Groundwater inputs near the shoreline of the lake were acidic
   throughout the year (pH <5 and alkalinity <0 mueq L-1) and reflected the
   influence of shallow soil horizons. Groundwater transported within the
   deep surficial deposits and through sediments farther from shore was
   characterized by higher alkalinity and higher pH values and was enriched
   in nitrate (>40 mueq L-1). Elevated concentrations of basic cations and
   alkalinity as well as lower concentrations of organic anions and sulfate
   were characteristic of deep groundwater entering the lake at the study
   site. Spatial variability of groundwater chemistry was found to be
   substantial over a relatively short distance (<6 m) from the lake
   shoreline and indicates that inputs to the lake of components dissolved
   in groundwater are highly flow path dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Although the existence of spatial variability in hydrogeological
   parameters is widely recognized, most analyses of pumping test data are
   performed under the assumption that the aquifer is adequately
   characterized by a few parameters, for example, constant transmissivity,
   constant storativity, distance to a barrier, and well skin. Even if the
   possibility of variability is recognized, pumping tests are often
   thought to investigate the region between a pumping well and an
   observation well. Recently, however, investigations of the sensitivity
   of pumping test data to radially symmetric nonuniform flow properties
   have shown that the drawdown at an observation well is insensitive to
   transmissivity and storativity of the region between the pumping well
   and the observation well. In this paper I use a perturbation approach to
   derive the Frechet derivatives and kernels for the effect of
   two-dimensional areal variations in transmissivity and storativity on
   drawdown at an observation well. Frechet derivatives and kernels are
   related to sensitivity coefficients, but their definition is independent
   of zonation. Examination of the Frechet kernels at large distances from
   the pumping and observation wells shows that the area of investigation
   of a pumping test is bounded by an ellipse that encloses both wells.
   This study also shows that observation well drawdown is relatively
   sensitive to near-well transmissivity variation, especially if the
   nonuniformity is not radially symmetric about the well.}},

Abstract = {{Currently available methods for interpreting data from unconfined
   aquifers are based on analytical solutions which restrict attention to
   flow in the saturated zone and account for drainage of water from the
   unsaturated zone through a source term. The parameter, specific yield
   (S(y)), is assumed to dictate the total quantity of water that is
   derivable through the desaturation process. It is commonly assumed that
   flow in the unsaturated zone has little effect on flow in the saturated
   zone and therefore that all the drainable water is instantly delivered
   at the water table as it declines in response to pumping. In a model
   proposed in 1954, Boulton empirically assumed that the drainable water
   associated with S(y) is released gradually at the water table as an
   exponential function of time. This concept of Boulton is similar to the
   notion of first-order kinetics frequently used to handle chemical
   transformations. Boulton's model is considered by some to have no
   physical basis. Numerical experiments performed on sand columns with
   reasonable properties suggest that vertical drainage of water at the
   water table due to a falling water table is a time-dependent process
   which is mathematically more complex than a simple exponential relation.
   Although Boulton did not provide a rational physical explanation, his
   exponential assumption has some merit in that it implicitly provides for
   a time dependent drainage process which seems to occur in the
   unsaturated zone. However, the simple exponential approximation is not
   adequate to account for what is seemingly a complex process. It appears
   that a physically comprehensive model of radial flow in an unconfined
   aquifer will combine time-dependent drainage from above the water table
   with vertical components of flow in the saturated zone. An additional
   assumption frequently made is that the well can be treated as a line
   source. Results from numerical experiments suggest that caution is in
   order before neglecting effects of well-bore storage in interpreting
   data from tests on unconfined aquifers.}},

   well as in the Redbeds aquifers. Hydrological and structural data were
   used to identify wells having mixtures of groundwater. The chemical data
   revealed that waters in the different aquifers are distinguishable by
   their chemical compositions and that mixtures have intermediate

Abstract = {{The Laplace transform with respect to time, t, is normally used in
   finding analytical solutions for transient groundwater problems. The
   behavior of a function at large or small t is known to correspond to
   that of its Laplace transform counterpart at small or large p,
   respectively; p is the Laplace transform parameter of t. This condition
   is generally translated as t being inversely related to p and vice
   versa. By this relationship many asymptotic solutions for large or small
   t have been determined from the Laplace domain solutions valid only for
   small or large p. However, an example is given here which shows this
   kind of asymptotic calculation may fail to yield correct asymptotic
   solutions. Hence, the asymptotic calculation must be exercised with
   care. To deal with this possible failure, the Tauberian theorem is
   offered to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of functions from their
   Laplace transform counterparts.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Several investigators have proposed solute transport models that
   incorporate the effects of transient storage. Transient storage occurs
   in small streams when portions of the transported solute become isolated
   in zones of water that are immobile relative to water in the main
   channel (e.g., pools, gravel beds). Transient storage is modeled by
   adding a storage term to the advection-dispersion equation describing
   conservation of mass for the main channel. In addition, a separate mass
   balance equation is written for the storage zone. Although numerous
   applications of the transient storage equations may be found in the
   literature, little attention has been paid to the numerical aspects of
   the approach. Of particular interest is the coupled nature of the
   equations describing mass conservation for the main channel and the
   storage zone. In the work described herein, an implicit finite
   difference technique is developed that allows for a decoupling of the
   governing differential equations. This decoupling method may be applied
   to other sets of coupled equations such as those describing
   sediment-water interactions for toxic contaminants. For the case at
   hand, decoupling leads to a 50\% reduction in simulation run time.
   Computational costs may be further reduced through efficient application
   of the Thomas algorithm. These techniques may be easily incorporated
   into existing codes and new applications in which simulation run time is
   of concern.}},
