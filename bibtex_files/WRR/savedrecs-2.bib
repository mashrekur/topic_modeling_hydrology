Abstract = {{The information and data used to support decision making under
   uncertainty in water resources situations can often be characterized as
   being very limited or weak. The representation of knowledge in
   conventional Bayesian decision analysis is in the form of precisely
   specified distributions and is the same no matter how weak the
   information source for this knowledge. A Bayesian analysis therefore may
   inadvertently impart too much precision to the input information and to
   the results. The concept of imprecise probability addresses this problem
   of excessive precision and a number of methods incorporating this
   concept have emerged. One such method, developed by Dempster and Shafer,
   accommodates greater imprecision by allowing the specification of
   probabilities on intervals. Theoretical aspects of the Dempster-Shafer
   methodology and its application to inference and decision analysis are
   described. A water resources example of an application of the
   Dempster-Shafer approach is presented, and the results contrasted with
   those obtained from the closest equivalent Bayesian scheme.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic optimization model for irrigation management and investment of
   an individual field is formulated. The model is applicable to situations
   where soil salinity is a current or potential problem and where drainage
   flows incur costs. The crop rotation is prespecified and several
   alternate irrigation systems are available for investment. These differ
   in application uniformity and cost. The field is assumed to be spatially
   variable in soil salinity and infiltrated water. The joint distribution
   of these two variables evolves over time in response to annual volumes
   of irrigation water and type of irrigation system. Social net benefits
   are defined as crop revenue net of irrigation costs, production costs,
   and environmental/disposal costs associated with percolation of water
   below the root zone. The optimization problem is to choose annual
   applied water volumes and investment in irrigation systems to maximize
   the present value of social net benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal decision rules and dynamics are characterized for the irrigation
   management model in the previous paper (Knapp, this issue (a)). For a
   constant crop and irrigation system, the decision rules are concave in
   E{[}s] and SD{[}s]. That is, seasonal water applications first increase
   as these variables increase, and then possibly decrease. Optimal water
   applications are observed to be decreasing in the correlation
   coefficient, although the effect is small. Optimal water applications
   and soil salinity follow a cyclical time path with a multicrop rotation.
   The decision rules for applied water are also found to vary for the same
   crop depending on place within the crop rotation. A range of irrigation
   systems are efficient depending on prices and other parameters.
   Investment dynamics are generally a constant type of irrigation system
   with possibly an initial transition period of another system type. More
   complex investment behavior is observed with constrained water supplies.}},

Abstract = {{Water demand is characterized for the cotton-cotton-tomatoes rotation
   considered in the previous paper (Knapp, this issue (b)). Demand is
   found to be price inelastic. However, currently low water prices imply
   that fairly moderate increases in water prices can result in large water
   savings. A marginal cost curve for source control of drain water
   emissions is constructed. Moderate increases in drainage emissions fees
   can result in large reductions in drain water emissions with relatively
   small impacts on income. Management response and income effects from
   increased water salinity are estimated. The model is also extended to
   consider drain water reuse. Typical optimal management with reuse is
   low-volume, low-quality water on first-year cotton, improved quality and
   quantity on second-year cotton, and the highest quality water on
   salt-sensitive tomatoes. An approach to maximization of multifield
   farm-level returns is proposed using decentralized pricing and the
   field-level optimization model.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury, which is transported globally by atmospheric pathways to remote
   aquatic environments, is a ubiquitous contaminant at very low (nanograms
   Hg per liter) aqueous concentrations. Until recently, however,
   analytical and sampling techniques were not available for freshwater
   systems to quantify the actual levels of mercury concentrations without
   introducing significant contamination artifacts. Four different sampling
   strategies were used to evaluate groundwater flow as a mercury source
   and transport mechanism within aquatic systems. The sampling strategies
   employ ultraclean techniques to determine mercury concentrations in
   groundwater and pore water near Pallette Lake, Wisconsin. Ambient
   groundwater concentrations are about 2-4 ng Hg L-1, whereas pore waters
   near the sediment/water interface average about 12 ng Hg L-1,
   emphasizing the importance of biogeochemical processes near the
   interface. Overall, the groundwater system removes about twice as much
   mercury (1.5 g yr-1) as it contributes (0.7 g yr-1) to Pallette Lake.
   About three fourths of the groundwater mercury load is recycled, thought
   to be derived from the water column.}},

Abstract = {{Radiosonde measurements above the heterogeneous forest of the Landes
   region in southwestern France provided vertical profiles of potential
   temperature and specific humidity in the atmospheric boundary layer. For
   all of the 62 profiles analyzed under unstable atmospheric conditions a
   surface sublayer could be identified within which the Monin-Obukhov
   similarity was consistent with the regional surface fluxes of sensible
   heat and latent heat (evaporation). For the potential temperature the
   vertical extent of this sublayer was found to be 41 (+/- 30)
   less-than-or-equal-to (z - d0)/z0 less-than-or-equal-to 130 (+/- 49),
   where z0 = 1.2 m is the roughness height and d0 = 6.0 m is the
   displacement height; for the specific humidity it was 48 (+/- 36)
   less-than-or-equal-to (z - d0)/z0 less-than-or-equal-to 153 (+/- 63).
   These results show that irregular forest surfaces are not anomalous, as
   regards the lower limit of the surface layer in comparison with surfaces
   with smaller roughness. The surface fluxes derived from the profile
   measurements were compared with flux measurements obtained by means of
   an eddy correlation system atop a 29 m mast, some 9 m above a mature
   section of forest some 4.5 km away from the launching site of the
   radiosondes; these independent measurements were made by a team from the
   Institute of Hydrology (Wallingford, England). On average, these two
   types of estimates were in good agreement. For the sensible heat flux
   the correlation coefficient was r = 0.75. For the evaporation rate it
   was r = 0.66. For the evaporation obtained by means of the energy budget
   from the sensible heat flux it improved to r = 0.82. The profile-derived
   fluxes did not compare as favorably with corresponding flux values
   measured above agricultural crops in clearings. This confirms that the
   forest was the dominant surface at the regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of integrating multicomponent mass transport equations
   over geologic time spans is demonstrated for the case of pure advection
   in a homogeneous porous medium. The mathematical formulation of the
   problem is based on the quasi-stationary state approximation, or
   multiple reaction path description, in which the time evolution of a
   geochemical system is represented by a sequence of stationary states or
   reaction paths. The method is implemented in the computer code MPATH
   which solves the transport equations in a single spatial dimension
   taking into account irreversible mineral precipitation/dissolution
   reactions and local equilibrium of aqueous complexing reactions. An
   adaptive grid enables the positions of reaction zones, with widths which
   vary over many orders of magnitude and which move with greatly differing
   velocities, to be tracked simultaneously over geologic time spans. There
   appears to be virtually no limitation to the number of chemical species
   that can be included in the code without rendering the computational
   effort beyond the bounds of a high-performance workstation. The
   numerical accuracy of the solution can be verified through global mass
   conservation equations and by comparing the asymptotic kinetic solution
   with the corresponding solution to algebraic equations representing
   local equilibrium conditions for pure advective transport, if such
   solutions exist. The code MPATH is applied to several examples including
   migration of redox fronts, weathering and hydrothermal alteration in a
   spatially varying temperature field. These examples demonstrate the
   absolute necessity of solving the governing transport equations for
   sufficiently long time spans in order to fully characterize the behavior
   of the system.}},

Abstract = {{A numerically efficient procedure is presented for computing optimal
   time-varying pumping rates for remediation of contaminated groundwater
   described by two-dimensional numerical models. The management model
   combines a pollutant transport model with a constrained optimal control
   algorithm. The transport model simulates the unsteady fluid flow and
   transient contaminant dispersion-advection in a two-dimensional confined
   aquifer. A Galerkin's finite element method coupled with a fully
   implicit time difference scheme is applied to solve the groundwater flow
   and contaminant transport equations. The constrained optimal control
   algorithm employs a hyperbolic penalty function. Several sample problems
   covering 5-15 years of remediation are given to illustrate the
   capability of the management model to solve a groundwater quality
   control problem with time-varying pumping policy and water quality
   constraints. In our example, the optimal constant pumping rates are 75\%
   more expensive than the optimal time-varying pumping rates, a result
   that supports the need to develop numerically efficient optimal
   control-finite element algorithms for groundwater remediation.}},

Abstract = {{A multivariate dynamic disaggregation model is developed as a stepwise
   approach to stochastic disaggregation problems, oriented toward
   hydrologic applications. The general idea of the approach is the
   conversion of a sequential stochastic simulation model, such as a
   seasonal AR(1), into a disaggregation model. Its structure includes two
   separate parts, a linear step-by-step moments determination procedure,
   based on the associated sequential model, and an independent nonlinear
   bivariate generation procedure (partition procedure). The model assures
   the preservation of the additive property of the actual (not
   transformed) variables. Its modular structure allows for various model
   configurations. Two different configurations (PAR(1) and PARX(1)), both
   associated with the sequential Markov model, are studied. Like the
   sequential Markov model, both configurations utilize the minimum set of
   second-order statistics and the marginal means and third moments of the
   lower-level variables. All these statistics are approximated by the
   model with the use of explicit relations. Both configurations perform
   well with regard to the correlation of consecutive lower-level variables
   each located in consecutive higher-level time steps. The PARX(1)
   configuration exhibits better behavior with regard to the correlation
   properties of lower-level variables with lagged higher-level variables.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison was made between using a lumped hydrological model and
   using a version of the same model applied successively to different land
   uses within subbasins. A watershed in the Rocky Mountains of British
   Columbia was divided into three contributing subbasins, and each of
   these was further subdivided by land cover classification using Landsat
   images. A hydrological model was applied separately to each land cover
   class in each subbasin, and the resulting hydrographs were routed to the
   subbasin outlet and then through lower subbasins. The final hydrographs
   were compared to those obtained using the model on the basin as a whole.
   It was found that using a semidistributed model gives goodness of fit
   statistics that are better than the lumped basin approach. The land
   class dependent parameter values found through optimization confirm the
   physical variations in storages and infiltration rates that would be
   expected in a mountain basin. The advantage of the semidistributed model
   is that relating the parameter values to land cover characteristics
   provides a method of investigating land use changes and allows the model
   to be more easily transferred to other basins.}},

Abstract = {{The topography of first-order catchments in a region of western Amazonia
   was found to exhibit distinctive, recurrent features: a steep, straight
   lower side slope, a flat or nearly flat terrace at an intermediate
   elevation between valley floor and interfluve, and an upper side slope
   connecting interfluve and intermediate terrace. A detailed survey of
   soil-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(sat))-depth relationships,
   involving 740 undisturbed soil cores, was conducted in a 0.75-ha
   first-order catchment. The sampling approach was stratified with respect
   to the above slope units. Exploratory data analysis suggested
   fourth-root transformation of batches from the 0-0.1 m depth interval,
   log transformation of batches from the subsequent 0.1 m depth
   increments, and the use of robust estimators of location and scale. The
   K(sat) of the steep lower side slope decreased from 46 to 0.1 mm/h over
   the overall sampling depth of 0.4 m. The corresponding decrease was from
   462 to 0.1 mm/h on the intermediate terrace, from 335 to 0.01 mm/h on
   the upper side slope, and from 550 to 0.015 mm/h on the interfluve. A
   depthwise comparison of these slope units led to the formulation of
   several hypotheses concerning the link between K(sat) and topography.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical models are developed to interpret tracer experiments
   conducted in divergent flow fields. The models account for the mixing of
   tracer in both the source and observation wells and for the diffusion of
   tracer into adjacent aquitards. A solution for the particular case of an
   observation well of infinitesimally small volume is also presented.
   Solutions are derived for both resident and flux concentrations and for
   macroscopically discontinuous conditions at both the inlet and outlet
   boundaries. The solutions for resident and flux concentration are
   identical when the mixing volume in the observation well is of finite
   volume. Two tracer experiments were conducted in a horizontally
   fractured shale to demonstrate the application of the new analytical
   models. Experiments were conducted with observation wells of finite
   volume and using a new sampling packer which eliminates the volume of
   the observation well. The results show that for experiments conducted in
   fractured media, the analytical model developed in this paper provides
   an improved fit to the shape of the concentration curve relative to
   models which do not account for mixing in the source and observation
   wells. Alternatively, by modifying the field method such that the volume
   of the observation well is eliminated using the sampling packer, either
   conventional models or the new model for concentration in the formation
   will provide equally suitable fits to the concentration data.}},

Abstract = {{Measured spatial patterns of water uptake were found to be related to
   measured throughfall patterns around trees, especially in dry months. To
   simulate these lateral feedback mechanisms, the one-dimensional soil
   water model SWIF was modified to a quasi-three-dimensional model
   allowing preferential water uptake from wet sites. Input-output
   relations, linking soil physical input parameters to simulation results,
   showed that soil water contents at field capacity and those after a dry
   period in summer could be used to parametrize the soil physical
   characteristics. To assess parameter values for the 2.5-ha research
   area, soil water contents were mapped using data from vertically
   installed time domain reflectometry sensors. Model results indicated
   that the spatial distributions of yearly water uptake and percolation
   fluxes were strongly affected by throughfall patterns, whereas soil
   water contents primarily depended on soil physical properties. Results
   also indicated that refined model parametrization can improve the
   reliability of model predictions of soil water dynamics at specific
   sites.}},

Abstract = {{A steady bubble plume model is developed to describe a weak air (or
   oxygen) bubble injection system used for the restoration of deep
   stratified lakes. Since the model is designed for two modes of
   operation, i.e., oxygenation and artificial mixing, gas exchange between
   water and bubbles has to be included. The integral model is based on the
   entrainment hypothesis and a variable buoyancy flux determined by the
   local plume properties and the ambient water column. Fluxes of eight
   properties are described by nonlinear differential equations which can
   be numerically integrated. In addition, five equations of state are
   used. The model leaves open two initial conditions, plume radius and
   plume velocity. Model calculations with real lake water profiles
   demonstrate the range of applicability for both modes of operation. The
   model agrees reasonably well with field data and with laboratory
   experiments conducted by various investigators.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical integration of Richards' equation for infiltration into
   homogeneous unsaturated soil is carried out by a moving finite element
   (MFE) method. Accurate solution of this one-dimensional nonlinear
   partial differential equation by standard finite difference (FD) or
   finite element (FE) methods can be obtained by using a fine
   discretization on space and time. This can lead to large computer times.
   With the MFE method, grid points are moved during computation along the
   wetting front, so that accuracy can be maintained by using a small
   number of nodes for simulating cases several meters in depth. For these
   cases the MFE method is faster than FD and FE methods. The numerical MFE
   model is verified through comparison with the quasi-analytical solution
   by Philip (1957). Moreover, we compare, for some other test problems,
   the computational efficiency of this method with that of two efficient
   pressure head-based FD and FE fixed grid formulations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a stochastic approach is developed for solving the
   inverse problem of parameter identification for transient groundwater
   flow. Adjoint state equations are derived for the stochastic partial
   differential equation (SPDE) relating transient head and log hydraulic
   conductivity perturbations. The derived equations can be used to
   calculate the covariance matrix of head observations and the
   cross-covariance matrix between head observations and log hydraulic
   conductivity measurements for each observation time, as well as the
   covariance and cross-covariance matrices between different observation
   times. The number of simulation runs required for obtaining these
   matrices is equal to the number of head observations. The reliability of
   model prediction is evaluated through the variance estimate method using
   adjoint sensitivity analysis and the cokriging estimate. The reliability
   evaluation of model prediction can be used as an aid in the optimization
   of experimental design for sampling strategies. A numerical example is
   given to illustrate the stochastic inverse procedure for a general
   transient flow problem. The example shows that using head observations
   of all observation times simultaneously produces much better results
   than using them sequentially (commonly known as the quasi-steady
   approach). The example also shows that it is possible to obtain a
   reliable stochastic inverse solution for meeting a given prediction
   objective based on a limited number of observations.}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented for a large-scale natural gradient tracer
   experiment conducted in a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer at a site near
   Columbus, Mississippi. The study was initiated with a 48-hour pulse
   injection of 10 m3 of groundwater containing bromide and three organic
   tracers (pentaflourobenzoic acid, o-trifluoromethylbenzoic acid, and
   2,6-diflourobenzoic acid). Over a 20-month period, seven comprehensive
   samplings of the tracer plume were performed at approximately 1- to
   4-month intervals using an extensive three-dimensional sampling well
   network. The dominant feature of the tracer plume that evolved during
   the study was the highly asymmetric concentration distribution in the
   longitudinal direction. This asymmetry was produced by accelerating
   groundwater flow along the plume travel path that, in turn, resulted
   from an approximate 2-order-of-magnitude increase in the mean hydraulic
   conductivity between the near-field and far-field regions of the site.
   The Columbus study is distinct from previous natural gradient
   experiments because of the extreme heterogeneity of the aquifer, the
   large-scale spatial variations in groundwater velocity, and the
   extensive set of hydraulic conductivity measurements for the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis is performed of a 20-month natural gradient tracer study in the
   saturated zone of a highly heterogeneous aquifer. Graphical presentation
   of concentration distributions versus time and spatial moments analysis
   reveal dramatically non-Gaussian behavior and a systematic mass loss.
   Implications of the mass loss on plume moments is analyzed through
   sensitivity studies. The moments data are interpreted by applying two
   simple models: (1) pure advection from a continuous source, and (2)
   advection plus dispersion in a converging nonuniform flow field. A
   longitudinal dispersivity of 5-10 m is estimated from the latter model
   and is somewhat larger than the value of about 1.5 m calculated by
   Rehfeldt et al. (this issue) using the stochastic theory of Gelhar and
   Axness (1983) based on independent measurements of the spatial variation
   of hydraulic conductivity. The dispersivity of 5-10 m is an order of
   magnitude larger than values measured at recently studied field sites
   (Borden and Cape Cod) with less heterogeneity, but an order of magnitude
   lower than would be computed from the moments data if the flow is
   presumed to be uniform.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity at a
   tracer test site, located at Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi, are
   presented. Direct measurements of hydraulic conductivity of the
   heterogeneous alluvial aquifer at the site were made using borehole
   flowmeter logging, slug tests, and a laboratory permeameter to test
   undisturbed soil cores. Indirect methods estimating hydraulic
   conductivity were also evaluated, including soil grain size analyses,
   surface geophysical surveys, and mapping of sediment facies. The spatial
   covariance of the 2187 hydraulic conductivity values obtained with the
   borehole flowmeter method was examined. The log hydraulic conductivity
   variance (sigma(ln K)2) and the horizontal and vertical correlation
   scales (lambda(h) and lambda(v)) of 4.5, 12.8 m, and 1.6 m,
   respectively, were estimated assuming second-order stationarity of the
   conductivity field. The covariance parameters are uncertain with
   bounding values that are 24-76\% above or below the estimate. Covariance
   parameters estimated with more limited nonflowmeter data were within the
   same magnitude as those obtained using the extensive flowmeter data,
   suggesting that data from a variety of methods may be used to provide
   approximate values of the autocovariance parameters. Nonstationarity of
   the ln K field was examined by removing three-dimensional polynomial
   trend surfaces and calculating variograms of the residuals.
   Significantly lower estimates for sigma(ln K)2, lambda(h) and lambda(v)
   of 2.7, 4.8 m, and 0.8 m, respectively, were obtained from the
   third-order log conductivity residuals. After trend removal, the
   bounding parameter values differ 15-44\% from the estimated values.
   Accounting for unsteady flow and the uncertainty in the covariance
   parameters of the third-order log conductivity residuals, the calculated
   longitudinal and horizontal transverse macrodispersivities ranged from
   1.5 m to 1.8 m and 0.3 m to 0.6 m, respectively.}},

   samples obtained from multilevel samplers. A laboratory soil column
   study indicated that adsorption of bromide during the field experiment
   was of the order of 20\% and that up to 10\% of the three
   fluorobenzoates was adsorbed. The presence of iron oxides and kaolinite
   in the alluvial aquifer combined with the low groundwater pH of 4.8
   produced geochemical conditions conducive to adsorption of the anionic
   tracers. Multilevel samplers (MLS) used in the field experiment were
   evaluated by comparing bromide concentrations from the MLS with water
   samples extracted from adjacent soil cores. Vertically averaged bromide
   concentrations for the MLS were 21\% lower than those for the cores. A
   matrix diffusion process in conjunction with a natural tendency for
   preferential sampling from permeable regions in the heterogeneous
   alluvial sediments is proposed as an explanation for the apparent bias
   in the MLS sample concentrations. This process is shown to be
   qualitatively consistent with the tracer mass balance observed during
   the natural gradient experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of horizontal fractures on the steady seepage of moisture
   in variably saturated porous media is analyzed by analytical and
   numerical means. The fractures are assumed to contain many open (dry)
   regions, and to be distributed periodically in two dimensions. The dry
   regions of the fracture form a barrier to moisture flow through the
   geologic medium. An idealized two-dimensional model that maximizes the
   barrier effect of the fractures is analyzed. The results of the analysis
   quantify the effect of the dry regions of the fractures on global water
   flow through the fractured medium. An apparent conductivity is
   determined such that the fractured system can be replaced by a
   homogeneous medium for describing steady unsaturated flow. An asymptotic
   analysis yields an analytic expression for the apparent hydraulic
   conductivity through such a system in the limit of small sorptive number
   (fracture spacing divided by a characteristic capillary suction) for the
   intact matrix material. The apparent hydraulic conductivity for
   arbitrary spacing and sorptive number is determined by numerical means.
   The numerical model accounts for variable hydraulic conductivity as a
   function of the local pressure head, whereas the asymptotic solution
   represents the limit of constant conductivity. The numerical results
   confirm the analytical solution as a lower bound on the apparent
   hydraulic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{A variable-density groundwater model is used to analyze the effects of
   various controls on the size of the freshwater lens, the structure of
   the transition zone, and the propagation of tidal fluctuations in a
   two-layer atoll island groundwater system. Modeling results indicate
   that mixing of fresh water and saltwater occurs primarily as a result of
   oscillating vertical flow due to tidal fluctuations and depends to a
   lesser extent on transverse dispersion along the dominantly horizontal
   recharge-discharge path of flow. The controls on the amount of mixing
   are: (1) the accumulated vertical distance, which increases with tidal
   range and is restricted by vertical permeabilities, and (2) vertical
   longitudinal dispersion. Comparison of cross-sectional simulations of
   atoll islands using nontidal and tidal models shows that the nontidal
   model must use artificially high values of transverse dispersivity to
   compensate for the lack of tidally driven, vertical mixing processes.
   Although the tidal model has high computational requirements, it can be
   used to calibrate vertical permeabilities and is best suited for
   problems dealing with groundwater resource evaluations, hydrologic
   events, and hydrologic processes. The limitations of the nontidal model
   are that it cannot be used for calibration of vertical permeabilities
   and will not realistically simulate those cases in which transition
   zones are thick or recharge low.}},

Abstract = {{Darcy velocity fields obtained from finite element solutions of heads in
   groundwater flow exhibit discontinuities at element boundaries, thus
   giving rise to inaccuracies in path line construction. Several methods
   have been developed to resolve those inaccuracies including global
   postprocessing of velocity fields, mixed hybrid finite element
   formulations, and stream function formulations. All of these techniques
   either lead to a considerable increase in the computational effort or
   are not general enough for all purposes. The point of view taken here is
   that standard finite element flow models yield exact water balances,
   which in the usual approach to path line computation are not fully used.
   By starting out from patches with flux-conserving boundaries, a new
   postprocessing procedure is derived that allows construction of a
   continuous flux distribution over the whole model domain. In this
   procedure only the head gradients of adjacent elements are used, thus
   avoiding the solution of another global system of equations.
   Furthermore. application of a stream function interpolation inside each
   patch allows the fast computation of path lines without any time
   stepping. The path lines computed with the proposed procedure are
   compared to path lines computed by usual particle tracking and examples
   are presented showing that the new method is vastly superior to
   traditional particle tracking.}},

Abstract = {{The functional relationships between soil hydraulic properties (K, theta
   and psi) are needed for analyzing unsaturated water flow in soils and
   are generally of a nonlinear form. These relationships, estimated from
   field-measured data, usually show large variability because of
   measurement errors and natural spatial heterogeneity exhibited by many
   field soils. A probabilistic approach is often employed to account for
   this uncertainty in parameters whereby the coefficients in the resulting
   partial differential equation are treated as random quantities (usually
   characterized by their moments). The objective of this analysis is to
   evaluate the errors resulting when simplified solutions based on simple
   forms of the hydraulic properties are used rather than nonlinear and
   numerically complicated models. As an example of a parametric functional
   relationship for K-theta-psi, we adopt the Brooks-Corey formulation in
   which a single parameter A is considered as random to emulate the spread
   encountered in practice. For data that show a large enough spread and
   when one is interested in the mean behavior of K, theta or psi, simple
   flow models such as the Green-Ampt model and the linear model are
   proposed as alternatives to the more accurate (but numerically
   demanding) Richards' equation. To compare models, scaled error
   definitions are introduced and are expressed as a percentage of the
   saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil. These time dependent
   errors are then computed under various boundary conditions. In general,
   the Green-Ampt solution is found to yield smaller errors than the linear
   model when compared with solutions from Richards' equation. It is
   concluded that the use of simplified models is justified when field data
   exhibit sufficient spread. and a tight bound cannot be placed on the
   parameter estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Short-pulse radar operating in the UHF band was used to search for
   unfrozen water beneath ice blisters and within the gravels of the
   Sagavanirktok River floodplain near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. The
   investigations were carried out in early April 1991, when daily mean air
   temperatures still were below -20-degrees-C. The radar pulse spectrum
   was centered near 400 MHz and the radar time range was set to cover
   about 10 m depth. The flat, snow-covered surface allowed good
   antenna-ground coupling, and the ice and gravels provided a low-loss
   propagation medium that allowed detail of the gravel structure to be
   seen in the data. Grids of several traverses were profiled at three
   sites, all within an area of about 0.5 km2 .Unfrozen water was inferred
   from the strength and polarization of the radar reflections. One site
   contained a large icing blister beneath which an extensive reservoir was
   mapped and seen to extend several tens of meters beyond the mound. Data
   from two other sites indicated taliks 5-7 m deep near a frozen mound and
   within the gravels. One of the profiles extended 700 m across the
   floodplain and revealed other high-reflectivity targets, which were
   presumed to be water, within about 7 m of the surface; a deeper sounding
   confirmed this depth limit. It is concluded that taliks exist in the
   floodplain throughout the winter and are a probable source for the
   numerous icing mounds seen along most Arctic rivers east of Prudhoe Bay.}},

Abstract = {{An exact peak capturing and essentially oscillation-free (EPCOF)
   algorithm, consisting of advection-dispersion decoupling, backward
   method of characteristics, forward node tracking, and adaptive local
   grid refinement, is developed to solve transport equations. This
   algorithm represents a refinement of LEZOOM, developed earlier by the
   senior author. In LEZOOM, a predetermined number of evenly spaced,
   hidden nodes was zoomed for a sharp front element. while in the EPCOF
   scheme, a subset of forwardly tracked nodes is zoomed. The number and
   location of this subset were automated. As a result, the peaks and
   valleys are captured exactly; and the ancillary problems of spurious
   oscillation. numerical dispersion, and phase errors are alleviated.
   Means of checking accumulated mass balance errors are provided.
   Application of the algorithm to two one-dimensional benchmark problems
   under a variety of conditions indicated that it completely eliminated
   peak clipping, spurious oscillation, phase error, and numerical
   dispersion. It yielded identical results, within the error tolerance, to
   exact solutions for all 19 test cases. Accumulated mass balance errors
   are extremely small for all 19 cases. The EPCOF scheme could solve the
   advective transport problems exactly, within any prescribed error
   tolerance, using mesh Peclet numbers ranging from 0 to infinity and very
   large mesh Courant numbers. The size of mesh Courant number is limited
   only by the accuracy requirement of the dispersion solver. Extension of
   this approach to multidimensional problems does not pose any conceptual
   difficulty and should alleviate the grid orientation trouble associated
   with such problems.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater recharge is one of the most difficult components of the
   water balance to measure. For this reason, electromagnetic methods have
   been used to infer its variability from measurements of apparent
   eiectrical conductivity. In this study, groundwater recharge was
   estimated at 20 sites using unsaturated zone chloride methods.
   Interpolation between drill sites was accomplished with the aid of a
   helicopter-borne electromagnetic survey (DIGHEM (IV)). Correlations
   between recharge and apparent electrical conductivity were only
   significant (R2 = 65\%) at the highest frequency (56,000 Hz). Using
   these single-frequency data, variations in recharge were mapped over an
   area of 32 kM2. Recharge, as inferred from the electromagnetic data,
   appears to be lognormally distributed, and varies from less than 1 to
   more than 50 mm yr-1. Within the study region, spatially averaged
   recharge can be estimated from the electromagnetic data, with an
   accuracy of approximately -60\%, +140\% (90\% probability). This is
   comparabie to the estimation accuracy when surface electromagnetic
   methods are used. Aerial electromagnetic methods appear very useful for
   identifying areas of high and low recharge over large regions.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper is a numerical study of a transient free-surface flow
   into an array of circular drainage ditches in a Porous medium. By the
   boundary integral equation method and a semi-Lagrangian description of
   motion, the groundwater table is tracked as a function of time.
   Primarily, we consider the case of atmospheric pressure along the ditch
   contour. An analytical small-time expansion is presented in an appendix.
   In contrast to the case of constant flux into a sink (Papatzacos, 1989),
   there is no cusp formation at the free surface. The flux into a ditch is
   approximately a linearly decreasing function of time. We also include a
   second version of the boundary condition at the ditch; parts of its
   contour are impermeable.}},

Abstract = {{A new, non-Fickian, constitutive equation is presented for the mass flux
   due to macroscopic dispersion in porous media. This constitutive
   equation contains the classical term of the diffusive type as well as a
   new term that may be viewed as an inertia term. Combination of the
   constitutive equation with the mass balance equation for a conservative
   contaminant yields a set of four first-order partial differential
   equations in terms of the three components of the vector of dispersive
   mass flux and the concentration. For the case of longitudinal dispersion
   only, this system is reduced to a set of two first-order partial
   differential equations in terms of the convective and dispersive mass
   fluxes as the two unknown functions. The sets of differential equations
   are hyperbolic and can be used to simulate and predict the movement of
   the front of a contaminant plume at finite velocity. An expression of
   the velocity of the front is presented in terms of the Darcian velocity
   and the ratio of the two dispersion coefficients that enter into the
   model. The effect of the non-Fickian terms decreases for increasing
   times; the model reduces to the classical one as time increases. An
   exact solution is presented for the case of one-dimensional flow and
   compared with the results of simulated column experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the fractal structure and properties of stream

   (d(f)). diffusion dimension (d(w)), and spectral dimension (d(s)).
   Mathematical definitions and derivations of the fractal dimensions are
   proposed, which provide a theoretical basis for some recognized
   empirical relationships in drainage basin geomorphology. Relationships
   among the fractal dimensions are examined, and the average values of the
   fractal dimensions for natural stream networks are estimated. The
   hydrological implications of the fractal dimensions of stream networks

Abstract = {{A process is developed to determine a waste load allocation that will
   implement the narrative criteria for fish and wildlife propagation found
   in states' water quality standards. The waste load allocation to
   implement the narrative chronic criterion is determined to be percent
   effluent at a location in the receiving stream, as opposed to an
   effluent concentration derived from the numerical waste load allocation
   process. A typical narrative chronic criterion is ``receiving streams
   shall not exhibit chronic toxicity outside the mixing zone,{''} while a
   typical numerical chronic criterion is ``receiving stream concentration
   shall not exceed 0.005 mug/L of chlordane outside the mixing zone.{''}
   Toxicity tests are used to implement narrative criteria, while
   compliance with numerical criteria involves concentration measurements.
   It is shown that the appropriate percent effluent is inversely
   proportional to the dilution factor for chronic toxicity. An appropriate
   waste load allocation to implement the narrative acute criterion is
   100\% effluent. Waste load allocation for whole effluent toxicity is
   feasible. The required independent variables are available to regulatory
   agencies, and toxicity testing has become routine.}},

Abstract = {{A lognormal cascade model is developed for representing basin scale in
   flood peak distributions. The model is developed from the multiplicative
   cascade modeling framework developed by Gupta and Waymire (1990) for
   spatial hydrologic processes. The lognormal cascade model has a simple
   parameterization of basin scale that can represent either simple scaling
   or multiscaling processes. Likelihood-based statistical inference
   procedures are developed for parameter estimation and hypothesis testing
   for the lognormal cascade model. The lognormal cascade model is used to
   examine scale properties of annual flood peaks from 104 stations in the
   central Appalachian region of Maryland and Virginia. Drainage area for
   the basins ranges from 0.3 square miles (0.78 km2) to nearly 10,000
   square miles (26,100 km2). The empirical results suggest two hypotheses
   concerning scaling properties of central Appalachian flood peaks: (1)
   the muitiscaling hypothesis holds over the entire range of scales (for

Abstract = {{As a generalization of the common assumption of exponential distribution
   of the exceedances in Partial duration series the generalized Pareto
   distribution has been adopted. Estimators for the parameters are
   presented using estimation by both method of moments and
   probability-weighted moments. The corresponding estimators for the
   T-year event are given and approximate expressions for bias and variance
   of the estimators are derived in both cases. Using the mean square error
   of the T-year event estimator as a performance index it is shown that
   the method of moments is preferable to the probability-weighted moments.
   Maintaining the generalized Pareto distribution as the parent exceedance
   distribution the T-year event is estimated assuming the exceedances to
   be exponentially distributed. For moderately long-tailed exceedance
   distributions and small to moderate sample sizes it is found, by
   comparing mean square errors of the T-year event estimators, that the
   exponential distribution is preferable to the correct generalized Pareto
   distribution despite the introduced model error and despite a possible
   rejection of the exponential hypothesis by a test of significance. For
   moderately short-tailed exceedance distributions (with physically
   justified upper limit) the correct exceedance distribution should be
   applied despite a possible acceptance of the exponential assumption by a
   test of significance.}},

Abstract = {{Eulerian-Lagrangian methods (ELMs) have been developed to reduce
   smearing and oscillations in numerically generated advection-dominated
   transport solutions. Improvements in front propagation characteristics
   are gained, but new sources of errors are introduced in the tracking
   step of ELMs. The Eulerian-Lagrangian least squares collocation method
   (ELLESCO) is applied to the vertically averaged transport equation, and
   the ELLESCO method is used to demonstrate how different types of
   discretization errors affect ELM solutions. The accuracy of ELMs is
   partially dependent on the accuracy of a tracking step. The tracking
   integration can be made as accurate as desired by dynamically adjusting
   the number of second-order Runge-Kutta integretion steps per finite
   difference transport step. However, the accuracy of the final position
   is dependent on accurate velocities. Inaccurate velocities can lead to
   poorly located concentration fronts and mass balance errors. Although
   ELLESCO can extend the spatial and temporal discretization limits of
   classical methods, concentration fronts must be spread over one and a
   half elements to avoid oscillations in the solution. Time truncation
   errors associated with concentration dependent source terms lead to mass
   balance errors, and source terms should be computed with the
   Crank-Nicolson approximation to avoid excessive truncation error. The
   size of the finite difference transport time step and the magnitude of
   the local velocity determine the distance between the head and foot of
   the particle back tracks. This distance, referred to as the Lagrangian
   spatial resolution, must be less than the characteristic length of areal
   sources, or distortions will occur in the concentration front. The limit
   on the Lagrangian spatial resolution is an effective limit on the
   transport finite difference time step size.}},

Abstract = {{The one-step outflow method was presented by Kool et al. (1985a, b) as a
   fast procedure to estimate unsaturated soil hydraulic properties. Many
   investigators, however, encountered difficulties obtaining a unique
   solution to the problem. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate some
   of the problems related to this method by looking at response surfaces
   and to make recommendations for improvements in the methodology. The
   one-step outflow procedure was investigated using synthetic data sets
   generated for 7.6-cm-diameter by 7.6-cm-high soil cores. A finite
   difference solution of Richards' equation was used to generate the
   synthetic data sets. Response surfaces were calculated for the van
   Genuchten parameters alpha, n, and K(s) for various combinations of
   matric potential, water content, and outflow data from initially
   saturated soil cores subjected to a step change in pressure at one of
   its boundaries. The results clearly show that with outflow data alone,
   the parameter estimation procedure will have difficulty converging.
   However, if matric potential data are available for a point in the core
   at some distance from the outflow boundary, parameter estimation
   sensitivity is greatly improved. The procedure used was found to be most
   helpful for determining which auxiliary variables should be measured for
   parameter estimation from outflow experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed evaluation of climate conditions in a small alpine watershed,
   typical of much of the southern Sierra Nevada, is presented for the 1986
   water year. Measurements of snowfall, meteorological and snow cover
   conditions, and snow cover ablation are used to characterize the climate
   at four locations in the watershed during that snow season. Data from
   these locations are then combined into two representative sites for the
   watershed. Measurement approaches and methodologies and the
   effectiveness of instrumentation used in the study are discussed, and an
   estimate of the uncertainty of the monitored meteorological parameters
   is made. The data are integrated into a continuous hourly time series of
   solar and thermal radiation, air, snow and soil temperature, humidity,
   and wind at the two representative sites in this remote alpine watershed
   for an entire snow season. Snow deposition and snow cover depth and
   density are measured manually at regular intervals throughout the snow
   season. While problems were encountered monitoring air and snow surface
   temperature, humidity, and wind, because of the extreme conditions which
   are likely to occur in an alpine environment, radiation is easily
   monitored, and the estimated uncertainty of all measured parameters was
   acceptably low. This effort was required,to develop a high quality time
   series of integrated climate data to evaluate the components of the
   energy balance of the snow cover during both deposition and ablation
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed evaluation of surface climate and energy exchange at the snow
   surface in a small alpine watershed, typical of much of the southern
   Sierra Nevada, is presented for the 1986 water year. Measurements of
   snowfall, meteorological and snow cover conditions, and snow cover
   ablation, described in part 1 of this paper (Marks et al., this issue),
   are used to characterize the climate. Each form of energy transfer,
   radiation, sensible and latent heat flux, soil heat flux, and heat flux
   by mass advection, is evaluated separately to determine how its
   magnitude changes during the snow season. These are then combined to
   approximate a snow cover energy balance and determine the relative
   importance of each form of energy transfer in the seasonal energy and
   mass balance of the snow cover. Radiation and sensible and latent heat
   flux dominate the snow cover energy balance throughout the snow season.
   During snowmelt, radiation accounts for between 66 and 90\% of the
   energy available for melt. Sensible and latent heat transfer during this
   time are of approximately equal magnitude but are usually of opposite
   sign and therefore cancel. Calculated sublimation during the entire snow
   season accounted for the loss of about 20\% (approximately 50 cm snow
   water equivalent) of the mass of the snow cover. This experiment shows
   that energy and mass transfer can be adequately monitored at a remote
   site using a combination of measured and modeled parameters and that the
   energy balance of the snow cover in the alpine zone of the Sierra Nevada
   is dominated by net radiation during snowmelt.}},

   water flows are investigated for different scenarios of flood events in
   homogeneous and heterogeneous media with the use of a two-dimensional
   model based on Richards' equation and the dependent domain hysteresis
   model of Mualem (1984). Hysteresis effects were found in general to be
   small, but sensitive to water ponding depth, hydraulic contact between

   tested, hysteresis resulted in higher rise of the toe of the water mound
   formed beneath the wadi despite a decrease of cumulative infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{Procedures for analyzing the effects of uncertainties on the on-farm
   time of application and applied depth of irrigation have been presented
   using two parameter-gamma densities for the different variables. The
   critical coefficient of variation (CV) in delivered farm flow rate
   beyond which variations in targeted depths cause more deviations in time
   of application is found to be 0.25. For a typical set of values for
   on-farm variables, reducing the CV of farm flow below 0.12 does not
   improve the variance in applied depth for the case of fixed CV values of
   0.10 for farm area and time of application. A distribution function for
   time of application has been derived which will enable the computation
   of reliable levels of application time. Solving the yield problems
   considering the application system hydraulics in a deterministic mode
   does not lead to large errors when the variances in the on-farm
   variables do not exceed 0.20. Generally, for shorter basins which are
   common in many countries, higher efficiencies can be achieved.
   Efficiencies less than 85\% begin to occur when the length of the basin
   exceeds 275 ft (84 m) for typical values of field parameters in soils
   belonging to the Soil Conservation Service infiltration family of 3.0.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport from soil to overland flow is an important source of
   nonpoint pollution and was investigated through tracer studies in the
   laboratory and at an outdoor laboratory catchment. The depth of surface
   water interaction with soil, defined as the mixing zone is a useful
   value for approximate estimation of potential solute transport into
   surface water under rainfall. It was measured in the laboratory for a
   noninfiltration case (0.90 to 1.0 cm) and estimated through mass balance
   modeling for an infiltration case (0.52 and 0.73 cm). At an outdoor
   laboratory catchment, mixing zones were calculated through calibration
   of a numerical model that describes unsteady, uniform, infiltration and
   chemical transport. Overland flow was simulated using kinematic wave
   theory. Mixing zone depths ranged from 0.47 to 1.02 cm and were a linear
   function of rainfall intensity. Also, the fraction of solute present in
   the mixing zone at the time of ponding which was extracted into overland
   flow was a linear function of the initial soil moisture content. A
   steady state analytical approximation of the solute transport model was
   also developed which overpredicted solute transport into overland flow
   by 1 to 60\%.}},

Abstract = {{Development of multiple hydroelectric projects at navigation dams on
   large river systems can result in a number of environmental impacts,
   including potential reductions in dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations.
   This study presents a method for generating hydropower development
   alternatives for evaluation by planners by quantifying the trade-offs
   between water quality and power generation. This method employs a
   Streeter-Phelps model to simulate DO and the bounded implicit
   enumeration algorithm to solve an optimization model formulated to
   maximize hydroelectric energy production. A portion of the upper Ohio
   River basin was selected to illustrate the methodology. The results
   indicate that various alternatives that meet the specified DO
   constraints can be generated efficiently. These alternatives are nearly
   optimal solutions with respect to the modeled objectives but are
   different with respect to decision variables.}},

Abstract = {{Tree ring indices from an expanded network of 17 white oak (Quercus
   alba) sites in eastern and central Iowa were used to reconstruct state
   average July Palmer hydrological drought index (PHDI), annual
   precipitation (previous August to current July), and other climate
   variables for 1640-1982. We removed nonclimatic variance trends caused
   by changing sample size and senescent growth. July PHDI correlated
   better with tree growth than annual precipitation. Occurrence of
   prolonged droughts throughout the reconstruction suggests that decades
   like the 1930s occur about twice per century in Iowa. Iowa climate is
   correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) from June in the
   year of El Nino onset (Yr0) through the next February (Yr + 1), with
   negative SOI (El Nino) associated with wetter conditions. When the June
   (Yr0) to February (Yr + 1) average SOI reaches extremes
   greater-than-or-equal-to +1.0 or less-than-or-equal-to -1.0, it
   correlates significantly with observed and reconstructed July PHDI (r =
   -0. 37 and -0.56, respectively). Climate during solar cycles centered on
   sunspot minima alternates between wet and dry regimes that differ by an

   precipitation for 1877-1982. The solar relationship has been stable
   since 1640. Combining solar and SOI influences in forecasts may improve
   prediction of Iowa climate.}},

Abstract = {{An adequate description of soil hydraulic properties is critical to
   modeling unsaturated flow. However, flexible descriptions based on the
   functions normally used may increase simulation times. This disadvantage
   can be overcome by using piecewise cubic approximation of such
   descriptions based on a table of function and derivative values. A
   further advantage of this technique is that the Kirchhoff transform
   variable can be approximated in the same way, even when it cannot be
   obtained analytically. Results for simulated infiltration into an
   aggregated soil indicated that hydraulic properties over the entire
   matric potential range could be approximated using 8-12 points without
   causing significant errors in simulations, whether the Kirchhoff
   transform was used or not. Run times using the original van Genuchten
   functions were 40\% or 280\% greater, depending on whether an incomplete
   beta function was used. The cubic approximation method thus allows more
   flexible use of the popular van Genuchten hydraulic property functions,
   since these involve incomplete beta functions unless unsatisfactory
   restrictions are placed on their parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The classical analytical method used to map catchments and
   time-of-travel zones of pumping wells was originally derived for another
   purpose and takes no account of recharge (Bear and Jacobs, 1965).
   Generalized catchment shapes are presented here for aquifers with
   recharge. They can be scaled to field situations through two or three
   nondimensional parameters. A semianalytical path line tracing model was
   used to generate the shapes. It contains new expressions for pore water
   velocities in two infinite strip, recharged aquifers, one with two fixed
   head boundaries, the other with one impermeable boundary. The resulting
   catchments differ significantly in both shape and size from catchments
   estimated by the no-recharge method. Generalized results are also
   presented for time-of-travel zones which are noticeably smaller than
   those calculated by the no-recharge method. Comparison with an
   equivalent recently released model from the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency shows the latter to give poor estimates of catchments
   and time-of-travel zones.}},

Abstract = {{Propagation of uncertainty in lake temperature models is studied using a
   vector state space method. The output uncertainty is defined as the
   result of deviations of the meteorological variables from their mean

   strongly affected by uncertain meteorological forcing. Air temperatures
   and dew point temperature fluctuations have significant effect on lake
   temperature uncertainty. Ignoring correlation in meteorological
   variables underestimates uncertainties in lake temperature estimates.
   Long-term average water temperature structure in lakes can be estimated
   by computer model simulation for just 1 year when results from a
   statistical analysis of meteorological variables are used as input. The
   analysis presents a useful alternative for the study of long-term

Abstract = {{THALES, a simple distributed parameter hydrologic model is presented and
   applied to two catchments in Australia and the United States, each with
   different dominant hydrologic responses. The model simulates Hortonian
   overland flow and runoff from saturated source areas and is used to
   identify some of the barriers to modeling the hydrology of small
   catchments. At Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, Australia, runoff is
   produced from saturated source areas, whereas on the Lucky Hills
   catchments at Walnut Gulch in Arizona, Hortonian overland flow processes
   dominate. Simulations at Wagga Wagga are based on published parameters
   and field data measured as part of an intensive field program and result
   in a relatively poor fit of the outflow hydrographs for a series of
   storms. The simulated position and growth of saturated areas coincides
   with the limited available information, indicating that at least the
   gross effects of subsurface water movement are being represented. For
   the Lucky Hills catchments, the hydrographs at the catchment outlet and
   points within the catchment are simulated for a storm series. The
   results are highly dependent on the parameter values, which are poorly
   defined, highlighting the lack of measured field data and lack of
   methodology for the collection of data at a scale appropriate for such
   models. The model structure is also shown to have a major influence on
   the output. The influence of simulating surface flow as sheet flow or
   rill flow or through a series of ephemeral gullies, as well as the
   choice of the surface roughness parameter and antecedent soil water
   conditions, is shown to have a profound effect on the distributed flow
   depth and velocity predictions. By fitting model parameters, a
   simulation assuming Hortonian overland flow produced similar results at
   the catchment outlet to those based on partial area runoff. These
   results are of concern since it is common to calibrate and verify
   hydrologic models based on the accuracy with which the catchment outflow
   is predicted. The internal estimates of flow characteristics following
   such a calibration often provide the input to sediment and nutrient
   transport models. Models such as THALES produce an enormous amount of
   information and have the theoretical potential to provide a
   ``universal{''} tool for the representation of hydrologic response.
   However, problems of verification and validation of such models are
   acute. These problems relate to the difficulty in measuring/deriving
   parameters a priori, measurement of the catchment response in sufficient
   detail for testing, and the validity of the fundamental assumptions and
   algorithms used in model development.}},

Abstract = {{Future directions for physically based, distributed-parameter models
   intended for use as hydrologic components of sediment and nutrient
   transport models are discussed. The attraction of these models is their
   potential to provide information about the flow characteristics at
   points within catchments, but current representations in process-based
   models are often too crude to enable accurate, a priori application to
   predictive problems. The difficulties relate to both the perception of
   model capabilities and the fundamental assumptions and algorithms used
   in the models. In addition, the scale of measurement for many parameters
   is often not compatible with their use in hydrologic models. The most
   appropriate uses of process-based, distributed-parameter models are to
   assist in the analysis of data, to test hypotheses in conjunction with
   field studies, to improve our understanding of processes and their
   interactions and to identify areas of poor understanding in our process
   descriptions. The misperception that model complexity is positively
   correlated with confidence in the results is exacerbated by the lack of
   full and frank discussion of a model's capability/limitations and
   reticence to publish poor results. This may ultimately diminish the
   opportunity to advance understanding of natural processes because the
   managers of research resources are given the impression that the answers
   are already known and are being provided by models. Model development is
   often not carried out in conjunction with field programs designed to
   test complex models, so the link with reality is lost.}},

Abstract = {{Field measurements to investigate the origin and growth of mesoscale
   gravel bed forms in deep flows were made in the North Fork Toutle River,
   Washington. Sonar observations of the gravel streambed at a stationary
   point were recorded during two storm flows in December 1989 and January
   1990 with concurrent bed load sampling and continuous velocity
   measurements. Mean diameter of bed load was about 3 cm, flow depths were
   1.4-2.4 m, and bed shear stresses were 2-5 times the critical stress of
   mean bed load diameter, as computed from the depth-slope product. These
   records document the hydrodynamic conditions under which dunelike coarse
   gravel bed forms were observed. Coarse gravel dunes (height, 20 cm;
   length, 6-15 m) evolved more than 24 hours after peak stage, primarily
   by accretion, as inferred from bed form changes revealed in dual sonar
   records. Dune heights increased to 40 cm as mean trough elevation rose
   about 50 cm over several hours. Smaller dunes (wavelength, 1-3 m),
   transitional from bed load sheets, migrated on the backs of the large
   dunes. The superposed dunes finally became indistinguishable from the
   large dunes, which diminished in height by increasing the mean level of
   troughs. Gravel deposition occurred at the observation point in
   conjunction with migration of gravel dunes. The direct comparison of
   known bed form regimes and gravel bar facies provides alternative
   interpretations of gravelly deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Results of an experimental investigation into steady state dissolution
   of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) entrapped within water saturated
   porous media are presented. The influence of porous media
   characteristics, NAPL type, and aqueous phase velocity on NAPL
   dissolution rates is explored through evaluation of a series of
   laboratory column studies. For many of the conditions tested, measured
   organic solute concentrations in the column effluents were below
   solubility limits, indicating nonequilibrium conditions. Entrapped NAPL
   distributions are examined and shown to depend upon porous media grading
   and mean grain size. Experimental results reveal a dependence of
   dissolution rate on the distribution pattern of entrapped NAPL, as well
   as upon aqueous phase velocity. A phenomenological model for the mass
   transfer process is developed which incorporates grain size parameters
   as surrogate measures of NAPL distribution. An additional set of column
   experiments, employing another porous medium and NAPL type, confirm the
   usefulness of the model as a predictor of steady state mass transfer
   rates in similar systems.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the effects of acidic deposition in the United States has
   focused largely on the role of sulfur deposition in the acidification of
   surface waters. Results from both long-term (up to 70 years) and recent
   monitoring of stream chemistry in the Catskill Mountains of New York
   indicate, however, that nitric acid has a significant and increasing
   role in surface water acidification that, during high-flow periods,
   rivals the role of sulfuric acid. Nitrate increases with increased
   streamflow throughout the year except during the late summer, when
   biological activity and its attendant nitrogen uptake are greatest; peak
   concentrations as high as 128 mueq/L have been recorded during spring
   snowmelt. In contrast, SO42- concentrations decrease with increased
   flow. The ratio of NO3-:(NO3- + SO42-) in the seven U.S. Geological
   Survey/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency long-term monitoring (LTM)
   streams ranged from 0.36 to 0.54 from August 1983 through February 1990.
   Seasonal Kendall tau tests for trends suggest a general decrease in
   SO42- concentrations and increase in NO3- concentrations in these
   streams during that period. Trend analysis of 19 large streams with
   periods of record from 23 to 70 years indicates that NO3- concentrations
   have been increasing in Catskill streams since 1970. The increasing
   trend appears to be primarily a result of increasing peak flow
   concentrations; base flow concentrations in the same large streams show
   only small changes over the period of record. Increases in base flow
   NO3- concentrations in headwater LTM streams have been larger, however.
   Trend information and seasonal patterns suggest that Catskill watersheds
   may be approaching nitrogen saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated zone solute and isotope profiles may be interpreted in terms
   of past changes in recharge rate in cases where water movement can be
   approximated by piston flow. A model is presented which describes water
   movement in terms of piston flow below a surface mixing layer. Below the
   mixing layer, diffusion and dispersion occur in the liquid phase in the
   case of solutes, and in both the liquid and gas phases in the case of
   isotopically labeled water. Climatic events of 4-5 years duration may be
   preserved in the unsaturated zone for more than 50 years if the recharge
   rate is greater than approximately 20 mm yr-1. Longer-term fluctuations
   in climatic conditions (century scale) might be preserved for over 1000
   years, provided the recharge mte is greater than approximately 2 mm
   yr-1, and the unsaturated zone is sufficiently deep. Profiles from
   Cyprus and northern Senegal appear to record changes in recharge rate
   over periods up to 400 years. The profiles are well correlated with
   known variations in rainfall, and fluctuations in lake levels. The model
   provides limiting conditions to be applied to the interpretation of
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the effects of modifying the runoff production
   mechanism used in the Willgoose-Bras-Rodiguez-Iturbe basin evolution
   model from Hortonian to subsurface saturation. The modified model also
   simulates basins that reproduce well common geomorphological statistics.
   This result confirms the ability of the model to adapt to different
   hydrological environments. The most important difference between the
   original and the modified model appears in the evolution of the
   hypsometric curve, particularly in the transition between saturated and
   unsaturated nodes. The role of mass movement due to diffusive processes
   (such as rain splash and rock slides) is more significant in the
   modified model due to decreased role of wash in unsaturated regions. A
   measure is developed to quantify the sensitivity of the model to initial
   conditions. Evolutions were found to separate in time following a power
   law, explaining the apparent randomness present in catchments simulated
   with only slight perturbations in their initial conditions. This
   apparent randomness is the result of the weakly chaotic features of the
   model.}},

Title = {{MODELING BIOTIC UPTAKE BY PERIPHYTON AND TRANSIENT HYPORRHEIC STORAGE OF
   NITRATE IN A NATURAL STREAM}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{To a convection-dispersion hydrologic transport model we coupled a
   transient storage submodel (Bencala, 1984) and a biotic uptake submodel
   based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Kim et al., 1990). Our purpose was
   threefold: (1) to simulate nitrate retention in response to change in
   load in a third-order stream, (2) to differentiate biotic versus
   hydrologic factors in nitrate retention, and (3) to produce a research
   tool whose properties are consistent with laboratory and field
   observations. Hydrodynamic parameters were fitted from chloride
   concentration during a 20-day chloride-nitrate coinjection (Bencala,
   1984), and biotic uptake kinetics were based on flume studies by Kim et
   al. (1990) and Triska et al. (1983). Nitrate concentration from the
   20-day coinjection experiment served as a base for model validation. The
   complete transport retention model reasonably predicted the observed
   nitrate concentration. However, simulations which lacked either the
   transient storage submodel or the biotic uptake submodel poorly
   predicted the observed nitrate concentration. Model simulations
   indicated that transient storage in channel and hyporrheic interstices
   dominated nitrate retention within the first 24 hours, whereas biotic
   uptake dominated thereafter. A sawtooth function for V(max) ranging from
   0.10 to 0.17 mug NO3-N s-1 gAFDM-1 (grams ash free dry mass) slightly
   underpredicted nitrate retention in simulations of 2-7 days. This result
   was reasonable since uptake by other nitrate-demanding processes were
   not included. The model demonstrated how ecosystem retention is an
   interaction between physical and biotic processes and supports the
   validity of coupling separate hydrodynamic and reactive submodels to
   established solute transport models in biological studies of fluvial
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of water table management practices (WTMP) on corn growth in
   1989 and 1990 at two field sites, Ames and Ankeny, Iowa, were evaluated
   by calculating crop water stress index (CWSI) and monitoring plant
   physiological parameters during the growing seasons. Experiments were
   conducted on field lysimeters at the Ames site by maintaining water
   tables at 0.3-, 0.6-, and 0.9-m depths and in a subirrigation field at
   the Ankeny site with 0.2-, 0.3-, 0.6-, 0.9-, and 1.1-m water table
   depths, and periodically measuring leaf and air temperature,
   transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetically active
   radiation (PAR) using leaf chamber techniques. Net radiation of canopy
   was estimated using the leaf energy balance equation and leaf chamber
   measurements and then correlated with PAR. Analysis of data revealed
   that net radiation, leaf air temperature differential, transpiration
   rate, stomatal conductance, and CWSI were strongly related to WTMP
   during vegetative and flowering stages of corn growth. Excess water in
   the root zone with a water table depth of 0.2 m caused the maximum crop
   water stress and ceased crop growth. Both water and oxygen could be
   adequately maintained for favorable crop growth by adopting the best
   WTMP. Results indicate that plant physiological parameters and CWSI
   could be used to evaluate the effectiveness of WTMP and develop the best
   WTMP for com growth in the humid region.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical flow of air and water into a Gardner soil is investigated
   numerically and analytically. Instantaneously applying a constant head
   of water to the soil surface initially produces a rapid diffusive change
   in air pressure in the soil, and a slower diffusive change in water
   content. Fluid flow comprises a region of descending water at air entry
   conditions, below which is a transitional layer of both airflow and
   water flow, which connects to a region with essentially the initial
   value of capillary pressure. Four flow regimes are identified. The
   initial compressive and resistive regimes are associated with air
   compressibility and viscosity. The well-known sorptive and gravity
   regimes are established later. During the resistive regime, the main
   effect of air viscosity arises from airflows in the lower region which
   cause the water content profile to lag behind the corresponding profiles
   predicted without effects of air viscosity. A Green and Ampt
   infiltration law may accurately describe the infiltration process,
   provided the suction head suggested by Bouwer is selected. Approximate
   agreement is obtained between the theoretical predictions, and the
   corresponding accurate numerical results.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic approach is developed for the determination of the
   reduction ratio between the annual maximum flow averaged over a
   consecutive D hour period and the annual maximum of peak instantaneous
   flow with the same frequency of occurrence. Initially, crossing
   properties of the integrated flow process are related to those of the
   instantaneous flows, using a Gaussian hypothesis. The scale of
   fluctuation of the river flow process is the key parameter which governs
   the theoretical reduction function. Application is made to numerous
   historical series from Italy. To facilitate the applicability of the
   model, a method of calibration based on currently available hydrometric
   information is proposed. Quantiles of flood volumes are obtained from
   the theoretical reduction function. It is verified that the reduction
   ratio is independent of the return period and appears to be insensitive
   to the underlying distributions of the component processes. The
   non-Gaussian case and scaling properties are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Using a particle-tracking procedure, numerical simulations are performed
   to evaluate the asymptotic limits and the length scale requirements for
   equivalent porosity estimates of discrete colonnade networks. The
   simulation results are used to determine differences between the scale
   requirements for equivalent hydraulic conductivities and porosities. The
   directional dependence of the equivalent porosity is investigated using
   a polar plot. For a continuous network of hexagonal colonnades with
   uniform apertures, the asymptotic porosity estimates become
   directionally dependent; the numerical values compare favorably with
   those based on theoretical considerations. With uniform apertures, the
   porosity values drop sharply whenever a fracture set is perpendicular to
   the applied gradient and thereby becomes nonconductive. With lognormally
   distributed apertures, the effect of a particular fracture set's being
   perpendicular to the gradient is overshadowed by the effect of
   distributed velocities, and the asymptotic limit for the equivalent
   porosity ellipse approaches that of a circle. For colonnade network
   models with filled or unfilled apertures, the computed length scale
   requirements for equivalent porosity approximation are slightly smaller
   than those for equivalent hydraulic conductivity. The study provides
   guidance in selecting an acceptable block size for use in a continuum
   model of groundwater flow and transport through colonnade networks.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term assessment of solute transport in the unsaturated zone is an
   important consideration for irrigation management, pesticide management,
   and subsurface contaminant restoration analysis and design. Mathematical
   models are often used to perform such analyses. Modeling fluid flow and
   solute transport in the unsaturated zone typically requires solution of
   the nonlinear Richards equation and an advective-dispersive equation for
   contaminant transport as a function of time. Such solutions are possible
   but computationally expensive. A simplified water balance approach to
   solve fluid flow in shallow, drained unsaturated zones has been
   developed and refined over the last 15 years. The objectives of this
   study were to use results from a water balance model to obtain solutions
   for solute transport in drained, shallow water table soils, and to
   compare the results with solutions based upon Richards' equation.
   Transient soil water flux rates computed with a water balance model were
   used as input to a Petrov-Galerkin advective-dispersive transport model
   to simulate solute transport in unsaturated soils. The transport model
   was checked for consistency by comparison with an analytical solution.
   Sample simulations showed good agreement between a Richards'
   equation-based transport model and a water balance-based transport
   model. Simulations were performed to show predicted trends in water
   quality over 1-year periods.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, two exact analytical solutions of Richards' flow equation in
   Fokker-Planck form using empirical nonlinear diffusivity and hydraulic
   conductivity functions were published. A direct application of the
   solutions is the modeling of cumulative water storage in a fixed depth
   under constant rainfall infiltration. Analytical solutions for storage
   require a change of variable of integration and a numerical inversion
   technique. The solutions contain three independent parameters including
   saturated hydraulic conductivity, the a parameter, and a parameter which
   defines the shape of the wetting front. Sensitivity analyses indicate
   that changes in parameter values give significant changes in cumulative
   storage curves. Cumulative storage can be measured by vertical parallel
   time domain reflectometry probes which are capable of measuring an
   evolving volumetric moisture content within a fixed depth. A nonlinear
   least squares fitting procedure may be used to evaluate the three
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical algorithm for simulation of two-phase flow in porous media
   is presented. The algorithm is based on a modified Picard linearization
   of the governing equations of flow, coupled with a lumped finite element
   approximation in space and dynamic time step control. Numerical results
   indicate that the algorithm produces solutions that are essentially mass
   conservative and oscillation free, even in the presence of steep
   infiltrating fronts. When the algorithm is applied to the case of air
   and water flow in unsaturated soils, numerical results confirm the
   conditions under which Richards's equation is valid. Numerical results
   also demonstrate the potential importance of air phase advection when
   considering contaminant transport in unsaturated soils. Comparison to
   several other numerical algorithms shows that the modified Picard
   approach offers robust, mass conservative solutions to the general
   equations that describe two-phase flow in porous media.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional prototype geochemical transport model was developed in
   order to handle simultaneous precipitation-dissolution and
   oxidation-reduction reactions governed by chemical equilibria. Total
   aqueous component concentrations are the primary dependent variables,
   and a sequential iterative approach is used for the calculation. The
   model was verified by analytical and numerical comparisons and is able
   to simulate sharp mineral fronts. At a site in Denmark, denitrification
   has been observed by oxidation of pyrite. Simulation of nitrate movement
   at this site showed a redox front movement rate of 0.58 m yr-1, which
   agreed with calculations of others. It appears that the sequential
   iterative approach is the most practical for extension to
   multidimensional simulation and for handling large numbers of components
   and reactions. However, slow convergence may limit the size of redox
   systems that can be handled.}},

Abstract = {{A thermal injection and storage experiment was conducted to investigate
   the feasibility of storing thermal energy in shallow unconfined aquifers
   near the water table. Heated water was injected into a shallow aquifer
   and plume temperatures were monitored over a 141-day period by means of
   a dense array of bundle-type piezometers. The highly detailed data,
   which provide the three-dimensional temperature distribution within the
   aquifer, give good insight into the physical processes of aquifer
   thermal energy storage, and provide an excellent basis for the
   verification of simulation models. The experimental data also allow the
   physical processes of heat advection, dispersion, retardation, buoyancy
   and boundary heat loss to be quantified. In a companion paper, a
   three-dimensional density-dependent groundwater flow and thermal
   transport model is developed and validated using the results of the
   thermal injection experiment.}},

Abstract = {{A fully three-dimensional numerical model for simulating coupled
   density-dependent groundwater flow and thermal energy transport is
   developed and validated. The transport solution is based on a finite
   element time integration algorithm which generates a symmetric
   coefficient matrix while retaining second-order accuracy in time. The
   use of a symmetric conjugate gradient solver for both the flow and
   transport matrices results in a high degree of computational efficiency.
   Three-dimensional deformable block elements are used to allow the model
   to conform to domains with irregular geometry. The thermal transport
   model is validated against the results of the Borden thermal injection
   field experiment presented in the companion paper. The model simulations
   provide an excellent match with the observed temperature distribution
   over time, with the effects of thermal buoyancy and losses across the
   ground surface accurately reproduced by the model. The model is shown to
   be a practical tool for simulating the type of low-temperature thermal
   transport problems that arise in connection with seasonal aquifer
   thermal energy storage and ground source heat extraction systems.}},

   the peak (summer) price elasticity of demand is more than twice the
   off-peak elasticity; cross price effects are important at the 5\% level

   related property features, and age distribution are simultaneously
   significant; and finally, peak period adjustment rates are found to be

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Allocation of water between instream uses such as recreation and
   consumptive uses such as irrigation is an important public policy issue
   in the western United States. One basis for identifying appropriate
   levels of instream flows is maximization of net economic benefits. A
   general framework for estimating the recreational value of instream
   flows was developed and applied to Montana's Big Hole and Bitterroot
   rivers. The paper also provides a synthesis of methods for interpreting
   covariate effects in dichotomous choice contingent valuation models.
   Precision of the estimates is examined through a simulation approach.
   The marginal recreational value of instream flow in these rivers is in
   the range of \$50 per acre foot (1 acre foot equals 1233.5 m3) for
   recreation at low-flow levels plus \$25 per acre foot for downstream
   hydroelectric generation. These values indicate that at some flow
   levels, gains may be achieved on the study rivers by reallocating water
   from consumptive to instream uses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the similarities of digital elevation maps (DEMs) of
   natural river basins and optimal channel network (OCN) configurations
   obtained minimizing the total rate of energy expenditure in the system
   as a whole and in its parts. Striking similarities are observed for
   natural and optimal networks in their fractal aggregation structure and
   in certain multifractal structures found to be characteristic of river
   basins. Our results suggest, upon critical assessment of the reliability
   of the identification of the attractor of the underlying dynamics
   implied by our optimality concepts, that fractal structures are indeed
   possibly a product of least energy dissipation. Power laws emerging in
   the description of the distribution of aggregated quantities from both
   DEMs and OCNs suggest a link with the framework of self-organized
   criticality in the dynamics of natural channel network formation. Also,
   the geomorphological description of OCNs reveals surprising analogies
   with well-known empirical or experimental results. A comparison of
   Peano's basins with OCNs suggests that nature seems to reject the type
   of strict self-similarity exhibited by Peano's construct in favor of
   different shapes implying statistical self-similarity not only because
   of chance acting through random conditions but also because of necessity
   as reflected by least energy expenditure considerations.}},

Abstract = {{Streams with acidic sulfate compositions (pH less than 3.5) are
   naturally generated in the alpine Geneva Creek Basin of the southern
   Rocky Mountains, an area underlain by Proterozoic metamorphic and
   igneous rocks that are intruded by Tertiary felsic stocks with
   associated pyritic alteration. These naturally acidic waters am similar
   in composition to more familiar man-made acid mine waters or to surface
   waters acidified by sulfate precipitation. Detailed study of the stream
   compositions has revealed the principal reactions driving the weathering
   process and was used to estimate the relative effects of snowpack ionic
   input versus the solute contribution from acid attack in soil zones and
   groundwater. In the Geneva Creek Basin, atmospheric sources of solute
   represent a minor component to the stream water composition, except for
   chloride, which can be used to determine the fraction of contribution.
   The weathering process is a balance between oxidation of sulfides,
   dissolution of silicates, formation of the clay minerals vermiculite,
   kaolinite, and smectite, carbonate neutralization, and precipitation of
   ferric and aluminum oxyhydroxides and aluminum sulfate. The chemical
   analyses of snow samples, multiple samples of water from Geneva Creek
   and its tributaries, and the composition of primary and secondary
   minerals identified in the basin serve as input to a mass balance
   geochemical model, which facilitates the interpretation of the principal
   geochemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the results of numerical analysis of dispersion of
   passive solutes in two-dimensional heterogeneous porous formations.
   Statistics of flow and transport variables, the accuracy and the role of
   approximations implicit in existing first-order theories, and the
   convergence of computational results are investigated. The results
   suggest that quite different rates of convergence with Monte Carlo runs
   hold for different spatial moments and that over 1000 realizations are
   required to stabilize second moments even for relatively mild
   heterogeneity (sigma(Y)2 < 1.6). This has implications for the extent of
   the spatial domain for single-realization numerical studies of the same
   type. A comparison of the variance of plumes with the results of linear
   theories (0.05 < sigma(Y)2 < 1.6) shows an unexpectedly broad validity
   field for the theoretical solution obtained from a suitable
   linearization of flow and transport. Reformulation of the same problem
   linearizing in tum the flow or the transport equations shows opposite
   deviations from the linear theory. The interesting consequence is that
   the errors induced by linearizations in the flow or the transport
   equations have different signs, and their effects on the moments of
   dispersing plumes are compensating, thereby yielding consistent
   formulations. Unexpected features of the statistics of probability
   distributions of longitudinal and transverse velocities and travel times
   are also computed and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Equations commonly used to estimate soil freeze-thaw depths in
   nonpermafrost and permafrost terrain (Stefan/St. Paul equations) are
   combined with a daily snowpack/soil water balance model to investigate
   the effects of soil freezing and thawing on water balance components and
   the effects of climate, soil, vegetation, and topography on freeze-thaw
   regimes. Sensitivity analysis indicates that soil moisture has a
   dominant influence on soil freezing and thawing, with distinctive
   effects of fall soil moisture contents versus spring and summer inputs
   after partial soil thawing. The combined models displayed reasonable but
   sometimes surprising responses to specific sensitivity experiments
   involving temperature change, vegetation change, and topographic change.
   Attempts to reproduce measured freeze-thaw regimes as reported in the
   literature were generally successful but limited by the short data
   record on most sites. An improved understanding and modeling of
   surface/air temperature relationships for unmodified and modified
   landscapes is identified as a critical need.}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of resources at risk to anthropogenic pollution require
   extensive environmental monitoring. In addition, such assessments are
   required to have a long-term monitoring component in order to evaluate
   not only the status but also the trend of the resources at risk to
   ecological stresses. There is a need to identify statistical
   methodologies that would provide effective and cost-saving environmental
   monitoring designs, since such monitoring surveys are very expensive. In
   this paper the purely sequential, accelerated sequential, and
   three-stage procedures are evaluated as effective fixed-precision
   sampling procedures for environmental monitoring. Current monitoring
   designs utilize a sampling methodology where each resource is assigned a
   population inclusion probability, with the intent of describing the
   distribution of the whole population of resources at risk to
   anthropogenic environmental stresses. This study assumes that existing
   designs accurately describe the population distribution. A simultaneous
   fixed-precision estimation procedure is developed as an efficient method
   of estimating practically relevant percentiles of the cumulative
   distribution function, using water quality data from the Eastern Lake
   Survey as a lake population distribution. Accelerated sequential and
   three-stage procedures are shown to be better alternatives to the purely
   sequential procedure, requiring fewer sampling operations without any
   substantial loss of efficiency. Depending upon the precision required,
   all procedures showed potential reductions in sample size by as much as
   60\%. These types of designs for environmental monitoring are expected
   to be advantageous in national monitoring efforts directed toward the
   assessment of the status and trends of various ecological indicators.}},

Abstract = {{The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) as an age-dating tool and tracer
   in shallow groundwaters has been investigated. New methodology for field
   sampling and preserving groundwaters containing parts per trillion
   concentrations of the CFCs, F-11 and F-12, is presented. Samples are
   analyzed by purge-and-trap gas chromatography with an electron capture
   detector. Physical and chemical processes that can alter natural
   concentrations (air-water equilibrium) of CFCs were investigated to
   assess dating uncertainties. CFC model recharge ages appear to be
   defined within 2 years under optimum conditions. The method was applied
   to central Oklahoma to demonstrate the usefulness of CFCs as (1) an
   age-dating tool of shallow groundwaters, (2) a tracer of sewage effluent
   in surface and shallow groundwaters, and (3) a tracer of shallow
   groundwater. Results of dating indicate two primary recharge periods in
   central Oklahoma over the past 45 years that correspond to the wet
   periods 1945-1960 and 1967-1975.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of transient, unsaturated vertical flow in different
   initially dry homogeneous soils using Richards' equation suggest that,
   for a relatively coarse numerical grid, there is no universal weighting
   scheme to estimate interblock conductivities capable of giving an
   accurate resolution of the resulting steep wetting fronts, except for
   the scheme associated with the Kirchhoff transformation (KT). The
   principal drawback of KT is that it can hardly be applied to
   heterogeneous soils. A new asymptotic weighting (AW) scheme, based on
   the asymptotic behavior of the hydraulic conductivity function in the
   vicinity of residual saturation, is proposed. Numerical tests
   demonstrate that the AW scheme describes wetting fronts in homogeneous
   soils nearly as accurately as a scheme based on KT. Applicability and
   robustness of the AW scheme for simulating water infiltration into
   heterogeneous soils having substantial vertical variation of hydraulic
   properties are also demonstrated. Extension of the proposed scheme to
   higher dimensions is straightforward.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport studies frequently rely on numerical solutions of the
   classical advection-diffusion equation. Unfortunately, solutions
   obtained with traditional finite difference and finite element
   techniques typically exhibit spurious damping or oscillation when
   advection dominates. Recently developed variants of these techniques
   such as the finite analytic method (Chen and Li, 1979; Chen and Chen,
   1984) and the optimal test function method (Celia et al., 1989a, b, c)
   perform well for steady state problems. Extensions of these methods to
   the transient case have, however, not been successful, primarily because
   of inadequate approximations of the temporal derivative. The new
   numerical method proposed in this paper avoids this difficulty by taking
   the Laplace transform of the transient equation. The transformed
   expression behaves like a steady state advection-diffusion equation with
   a first-order decay term. This expression can be solved with either the
   finite analytic or optimal test function method and the time dependence
   recovered with an efficient inverse Laplace transform algorithm. The
   result is an accurate and robust transient solution which performs well
   over a very wide range of Peclet numbers. We demonstrate this approach
   by applying the finite analytic method to a Laplace transformed
   one-dimensional model problem. A comparison with other competing
   techniques shows that good approximations are required in both space and
   time in order to obtain accurate solutions to advection-dominated
   problems. A good space approximation combined with a poor temporal
   approximation (or vice versa) does not give satisfactory results. The
   method we propose provides a balanced space-time approximation which
   works very well for one-dimensional problems. Extensions to multiple
   dimensions are conceptually straightforward and briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the capillary zone on groundwater flow is usually taken
   into account by a constant storativity parameter in vertically
   integrated models of extended phreatic aquifers. Hysteresis of the water
   content characteristics may, however, significantly influence the
   response of phreatic aquifers in time-dependent flow processes. For this
   reason a variable storativity concept is introduced. It is based on the
   hysteresis model of Mualem and is restricted to primary wetting or
   drying curves. Assuming a static pressure distribution in the vertical,
   storativity is a function of the position of the phreatic surface. The
   unsteady vertically integrated groundwater model thus becomes nonlinear.
   The model is checked with data from sandbox experiments. It accurately
   reproduces the time-dependent flow influenced by hysteresis in the water
   content characteristics. Applications to unidirectional flow are
   presented in dimensionless form.}},

Abstract = {{Unstable dense aqueous phase contaminant plumes may contaminate larger
   regions of an aquifer than stable plumes. To learn more about the
   behavior of variable density contaminant plumes, experiments were
   conducted in a flow container packed with homogeneous sand. Salt (NaI)
   solutions with different densities were introduced at different rates
   from a source, located on top of the sand, into the unconfined aquifer
   model where horizontal ambient groundwater streams were established with
   different horizontal velocities. Salt concentrations were measured with
   an automated, nonintrusive gamma radiation system. Results show that
   dense plumes were either stable or unstable. Important factors
   determining the stability of the dense plumes were the magnitude of the
   horizontal Darcy velocity and the relative density difference between
   the dense plume and the ambient groundwater. Longitudinal and transverse
   dispersivities, estimated from breakthrough curves and concentration
   profiles determined during the development of stable dense plumes, were
   small, indicating advection as the main mode of transport. Concentration
   profiles of stable dense plumes, taken along vertical transects, showed
   a rapid drop in relative concentration at the bottom of the plumes. When
   dense plumes became unstable, salt concentrations fluctuated
   considerably over time and concentration profiles of unstable plumes
   showed large mixing zones.}},

Abstract = {{Field tracer migration in sparsely fractured rock is analyzed with a
   discrete fracture network model that has been calibrated on fracture and
   flow data from the Stripa-3D experiment in Sweden. Comparison between
   transport simulations in the flow-calibrated discrete model and tracer
   tests of the field experiment confirms the fracture network parameters
   obtained from the flow analysis except for the variance of the fracture
   conductivities which had to be increased. The discrete model reproduces
   the uneven spatial distribution of flow and tracers, the complex
   dispersive behavior, and channeling effects that have been observed in
   the field experiment. As a result of flow channeling, transport occurs
   along preferential paths whose transport properties may substantially
   deviate from the medium average properties. For example, porosity and
   wetted fracture surface area available to sorption may be reduced by
   almost 2 orders of magnitude compared to the medium average values.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial responses of two types of time domain reflectometry (TDR)
   probes used for measuring the water content of soils and other porous
   materials are examined. We investigate the effect of spatial variation
   in the water content of the sample on the measured value of the water
   content for both the coaxial cylinders probe and the two parallel wires
   probe. The response of the instrument to water content distributions
   that are perturbed slightly from a uniform distribution is calculated,
   using the conventional electrostatic treatment of electromagnetic wave
   propagation in the transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode. Under this
   small perturbation assumption, we show that the spatial weighting
   function is approximately proportional to the distribution of
   electromagnetic energy between the electrodes for uniform water content,
   calculated from a solution of Laplace's equation for each probe type.
   For coaxial probes, most of the energy (and hence most of the
   measurement sensitivity) is concentrated around the inner cylinder in a
   ``skin effect{''} if the ratio of the radii of the inner and outer
   cylinders is too small. For parallel wire probes, most of the
   measurement sensitivity is close to the wires if the wire diameter is
   too small compared to the spacing between them. This can cause
   significant errors if there is an air gap close to the wires or soil
   around the wires has been compacted by the process of inserting them
   into the soil.}},

   Split-sample studies using data from tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay

   some cases where the model exhibited significant lack of fit. For total
   nitrogen (TN) the average difference between the MVUE estimates and the
   observed loads ranges from -8\% to +2\% at the four sites. The
   corresponding range for total phosphorus (TP) is -6\% to +5\%. None of

   of the MVUE load estimates for TN and TP, which ranges from 7\% to 25\%

Abstract = {{The steady state tracer gas method was used to determine gas exchange
   rate constants (k) for a small stream (annual average flow
   less-than-or-equal-to 1 m3/min) draining the West Fork of Walker Branch
   watershed in eastern Tennessee. Chloride was used as a conservative
   tracer to account for dilution by lateral inflow, and propane and ethane
   were used as volatile tracers. Gas exchange rate constants for propane
   (k(p)) were about 100 d-1 over a wide range of flow conditions, while
   those for ethane (k(e)) were about 117 d-1; an equivalent rate constant
   for O2 (k(O2)) would be about 118-139 d-1, depending on the method used
   for its calculation. These rate constants are much larger than those
   typically found in rivers and large streams. Much lower k(p) values
   (about 50 d-1) were found during one experiment conducted at low flow
   with much of the stream surface covered with floating leaves. Nineteen
   previously published empirical equations were used to predict k(O2)
   values for one 72-m stream reach; agreement between the predicted and
   measured values was generally very poor, underscoring the importance of
   field-measured gas exchange rates in studies of the transport and fate
   of volatile compounds. Because ethane and propane have similar gas
   exchange rates and similar aqueous diffusion coefficients (k(e)/k(p) and
   D(e)/D(p) are both close to 1, where D is the compound's diffusion
   coefficient), accurate determination of the exponent n in the
   relationship k(e)/k(p) = (D(e)/D(p))n was not possible. The ratio
   k(e)/k(p) (1.17) is much closer to D(e)/D(p) (1.24) than H(e)/H(p)
   (0.82, where H is the compound's Henry's law constant), suggesting that
   stripping of dissolved volatiles by air bubbles was not a dominant mode
   of gas exchange for the study stream.}},

Abstract = {{When conventional statistical techniques are used with model-simulated
   flows to estimate flood frequencies for different basin scenarios or for
   regulated flow conditions, the resulting estimates can appear
   inconsistent with the simulated flood data. In this paper we describe a
   new approach for flood frequency analysis of model-simulated flows.
   Rather than fitting a probability distribution directly to simulated
   peak discharges, separate distributions are estimated for runoff volumes
   and for peak discharges conditioned on runoff volumes. The latter
   estimation is based on rainfall-runoff modeling using historical
   rainfall data for the basin of interest as well as data from extreme
   storms that have occurred in the region. The modeling of extreme events
   forces consistency in the resulting flood frequency estimates. An
   example illustrates the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{Inversion of Dagan's two- and three-dimensional stochastic models using
   Freyberg's (1986), Rajaram and Gelhar's (1988, 1991), and Barry and
   Sposito's (1990) moment data from the Borden experiment is carried out
   to examine (1) the validity of the two-dimensional (Dagan, 1982) and
   three-dimensional (Dagan, 1988) models and (2) the reduction in
   uncertainty of the spatial moments over nonconditioned estimates. A
   direct application of Bayesian statistical inference, in conjunction
   with Monte Carlo integration, is used to produce posterior probability
   density functions for the parameters. The parameter ranges from all
   methods show horizontal integral scales lambda between 1.85 and 4.04 m,
   vertical integral scales lambda(z) between 0. 144 and 0.459 m, and log
   hydraulic conductivities In (K) between 0.120 and 0.197. These results
   compare well to the earlier estimates of Woodbury and Sudicky (1991) and
   Robin et al. (1991). We show that moment prediction uncertainty is
   substantially reduced when both tracer moment data and prior estimates
   of the In (K) geostatistical parameters are incorporated into
   theoretical formulae based on stochastic dispersion theory.}},

Abstract = {{The Laplace transform method is employed to obtain the solution to
   several boundary value problems in which mixing occurs in reservoirs
   attached to a porous medium. Flow is assumed to be uniformly
   one-dimensional throughout the porous medium. Solutions are obtained for
   both continuous and discontinuous concentrations at the reservoir-medium
   boundary and for resident and flux-averaged concentrations. A mass
   balance conducted on each solution shows that neither continuity
   condition can be proved generally superior. An evaluation of the
   parametric sensitivity of the solutions is also conducted and shows that
   the distinction between the continuity conditions and the flux and
   resident concentrations is only important at small Peclet numbers. The
   only exception to this is the distinction between flux-averaged versus
   resident continuous concentrations in a finite solution domain. In this
   case, the flux concentrations were found to be insensitive to the volume
   of the downstream reservoir and, consequently, the flux and resident
   concentrations can differ substantially for larger reservoirs. In
   consideration of the general behavior of the solutions, three conceptual
   problems were identified which must be investigated by physical
   modeling: (1) determination of the appropriate solution at small Peclet
   number, (2) the possibility that dispersive mass flux occurs from the
   upstream reservoir under conditions of continuous concentration, and (3)
   the use of the flux transformation for continuous concentration in a
   finite solution domain. The physical modeling is discussed in a
   companion paper.}},

Abstract = {{As the result of a theoretical comparison of analytical models for
   one-dimensional solute transport (Novakowski, this issue), it has been
   found that to reconcile the substantial differences observed between the
   models under conditions of large dispersion, a physical modeling study
   of the processes of solute transport in the vicinity of boundaries must
   be undertaken. The physical modeling is conducted using columns ranging
   in diameter from 76 to 352 mm and length from 300 to 400 mm. Geological
   materials of either large or small coefficient of dispersion are
   employed as packing for the columns. Reservoirs of finite volume are
   located at the inlet and outlet boundaries of each column. Using a
   conservative fluorescent tracer, experiments are conducted to
   investigate the use of macroscopic continuity in concentration at the
   boundaries, and the use of the flux-averaged transformation for this
   boundary value problem. Concentration of the tracer was determined
   noninvasively from both the inlet and outlet reservoirs and, for some
   experiments, resident concentration was determined from within the
   interior of the column by excavation. Results of the experiments
   conducted using different volumes of the outlet reservoir show that the
   analytical model for flux concentration accounting for macroscopic
   continuity in concentration at the boundaries only poorly simulates the
   physical mixing process in the outlet reservoir. In addition, the
   results of the experiments conducted in which resident concentrations
   were determined from the interior of the column show that the concept of
   macroscopic continuity is not supported by physical evidence at either
   the inlet or outlet boundary. Thus, the analytical model in which
   concentration at the boundaries is macroscopically discontinuous best
   simulates the solute transport processes for this boundary value
   problem. Unfortunately, the solutions for resident and flux
   concentration with these boundary conditions are identical and further
   distinction between these models cannot be undertaken. Analytical
   inversion of the Laplace domain solution is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a macroscopic invasion percolation process
   suitable for simulating the displacement of one immiscible fluid by
   another through porous media under conditions of capillary-dominated
   flow. The theory is similar to classical percolation theory in that the
   structure of a real porous medium is represented as an ordered lattice,
   but differs in that each point of the lattice is assigned a local-scale
   porosity, permeability, and capillary pressure-saturation relationship,
   rather than microscale pore and pore throat dimensions. Unlike
   pore-scale percolation theory, each node of the lattice may be occupied
   by either one or two phases, thereby allowing bicontinua of fluids in
   two dimensions. To illustrate an application of the theory, both wetting
   and nonwetting fluids are percolated through a heterogeneous porous
   medium while accounting for fluid trapping such that a hysteretic,
   large-scale capillary pressure-saturation curve is constructed. The
   simulations are carried out in spatially correlated, random permeability
   fields assuming that the local-scale capillary pressure-saturation
   relationships are perfectly correlated with permeability. The resulting
   large-scale capillary pressure curves are found to be influenced by the
   mean and variance of the assigned lognormal distribution of
   permeabilities. Very little sensitivity to the ratio of correlation
   lengths was observed. It is found that the threshold saturation giving
   rise to an initial percolating cluster of nonwetting fluid across the
   lattice corresponds to between 18.8\% and 29.5\% nonwetting saturation,
   depending on the statistics of the permeability field. Comparison of the
   percolation-derived capillary pressure curves to those based on a direct
   arithmetic average demonstrates that an arithmetic average is only valid
   through the range of fluid saturations where no trapping occurs.}},

Abstract = {{It is important to predict the transport of solute in fractured systems.
   In these systems the majority of solute advection occurs within the
   fractures. However, the diffusive coupling with the large storage
   contained within the rock matrix often significantly slows down the
   effective solute velocity below that of the physical fluid velocity
   within the fractures. The coupling between these two porosity systems is
   further complicated by the fact that the fluid within the fractures
   flows in distinct channels which occupy a small percent of the fracture
   plane. This paper extends the work of Rasmuson and Neretnieks (1986) and
   Johns and Roberts (1991) in analyzing the consequences of the channeling
   on the solute coupling between these two porosity systems. It has been
   found by Rasmuson and Neretnieks that the amount of coupling can be
   significantly reduced due to the fracture channeling if the time scales
   of interest are short when compared to diffusive time scales in the rock
   matrix system. This study shows that for longer time scales this
   reduction in the coupling is greatly reduced. Experimental measurements
   are still required to enable verification of the assumptions made in
   this and other analytical studies of fracture matrix coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Many investigators have sought to develop regional multivariate
   regression models which relate low-flow statistics to watershed
   characteristics. Normally, a multiplicative model structure is imposed
   and multivariate statistical procedures are employed to select suitable
   watershed characteristics and to estimate model parameters. Since such
   procedures have met with only limited success, we take a different
   approach. A simple conceptual stream-aquifer model is extended to a
   watershed scale and evaluated for its ability to approximate the
   low-flow behavior of 23 unregulated catchments in Massachusetts. The
   conceptual watershed model is then adapted to estimate low-flow
   statistics using multivariate regional regression procedures. Our
   results indicate that in central western Massachusetts, low-flow
   statistics are highly correlated with the product of watershed area,
   average basin slope and base flow recession constant, with the base flow
   recession constant acting as a surrogate for both basin hydraulic
   conductivity and drainable soil porosity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present an analytical model for the concentration of
   suspended sediments in the proximity of the bed of gravel rivers. The
   model is applicable to high-gradient streams carrying sands and finer
   sediment particles in suspension over poorly sorted gravel beds. The
   analysis is carried out in terms of equations which realistically
   describe the velocity profile of the carrying stream and the dispersion
   of heavy particles in turbulent shear flows over stable gravel beds. To
   test our hypotheses we verified the equations using available flume and
   fiver data and evaluated their response for various combinations of bed
   roughness and suspended load characteristics. Our results indicate that
   characterization of the near-bed concentration can be formulated in
   terms of a velocity defect representation of the mean turbulent velocity
   profile and a sediment eddy diffusivity distribution developed for sand
   bed rivers. The near-bed concentration is shown to be rather sensitive
   to variations in the gravel bed relative roughness, the depth at which
   the concentration is evaluated above the virtual bed surface, and the
   ratio between the settling velocity of the suspended sediment and the
   bed shear velocity.}},

Abstract = {{A radiative transfer algorithm is combined with digital elevation and
   satellite reflectance data to model spatial variability in net solar
   radiation at fine spatial resolution. The method is applied to the
   tall-grass prairie of the 16 x 16 km2 FIFE site (First ISLSCP Field
   Experiment) of the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology
   Project. Spectral reflectances as measured by the Landsat thematic
   mapper (TM) are corrected for atmospheric and topographic effects using
   field measurements and accurate 30-m digital elevation data in a
   detailed model of atmosphere-surface interaction. The spectral
   reflectances are then integrated to produce estimates of surface albedo
   in the range 0.3-3.0-mu-m. This map of albedo is used in an atmospheric
   and topographic radiative transfer model to produce a map of net solar
   radiation. A map of apparent net solar radiation is also derived using
   only the TM reflectance data, uncorrected for topography, and the
   average field-measured downwelling solar irradiance. Comparison with
   field measurements at 10 sites on the prairie shows that the
   topographically derived radiation map accurately captures the spatial
   variability in net solar radiation, but the apparent map does not. The
   regional means for the entire site, as estimated from field measurements
   by themselves, from the topographic model, and from the apparent net
   solar radiation map are nearly equal, although the variance is an order
   of magnitude larger for the topographic model.}},

Title = {{TRANSPORT OF RATE-LIMITED SORBING SOLUTES IN HETEROGENEOUS POROUS-MEDIA
   - APPLICATION OF A ONE-DIMENSIONAL MULTIFACTOR NONIDEALITY MODEL TO
   FIELD DATA}},

Abstract = {{The results of several experiments reported in the literature indicate
   that the assumptions of porous media homogeneity and instantaneous
   sorption are generally invalid for transport of sorbing solute at the
   field scale. In addition, it is probable that the ``nonideal{''}
   transport observed is caused by more than one factor. The purpose of
   this work was to evaluate the ability of a one-dimensional, multifactor
   nonideality model to represent the nonideal transport of sorbing solutes
   at the field scale. For this model the two-domain approach is used to
   represent heterogeneity, and sorption is represented as being
   essentially instantaneous for a portion of the sorbent and mte limited
   for the remainder. Data (breakthrough curves) obtained from four field
   experiments reported in the literature were used to test the performance
   of the model. With one exception, data from laboratory or field
   experiments were used to identify values for input parameters; the
   exception concerned an assumption of a uniform distribution of sorbent
   between the advective and nonadvective pore water domains. Specification
   of input parameters independent of the data being simulated allowed the
   model to be used in a predictive mode. On the basis of the good match
   between predictions produced with the model and the data, it appears
   that the model provides a valid representation of sorption dynamics and
   solute transport for field-scale systems influenced by heterogeneity and
   rate-limited sorption. The model should be useful in situations where
   the extensive input data required for more complex models (e.g.,
   stochastic) are not available.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved oxygen and substrates are transported and processed
   abiotically and biotically in aquifers. A mathematical model for the
   one-dimensional simultaneous transport and fate of dissolved oxygen and
   substrate in an aerobic water-saturated linear equilibrium sorption
   homogeneous porous medium is presented. Transport is by coupled
   one-dimensional advection-dispersion equations. Modified Monod kinetics
   are used to define the substrate and oxygen utilization rates. The
   dynamically aerobic microbe population is simultaneously modeled. The
   resulting coupled system of nonlinear oxygen-substrate-microbe
   population equations is solved via an Eulerian-Lagrangian method. This
   is based upon splitting the time operator and using Lagrange cubic
   splines across the entire domain to solve the advective portion first.
   The diffusive portion is then solved. An explicit time integration
   algorithm is sketched. Two numerical validation scenarios are discussed.
   Three realistic field scenarios are presented based upon published
   literature kinetic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{An exact integral solution for the moisture profile in growing fingers
   in sandy soil is derived from Richards' equation. The solution provides
   moisture content along a finger as a function of position and time and
   provides applicable results, including the calculation of the asymptotic

   unsaturated conductivity in a single experiment. The solution is
   verified experimentally through comparison with measurements of matric
   potential and moisture content using high-speed tensiometers.}},

Abstract = {{Lateral downslope vadose flow occurs in hillslopes with deep homogeneous
   soils. When and why this happens has been partially answered by past
   experimental, numerical, and quasi-analytical studies' What has been
   overlooked, however, is that lateral downslope flow in unlayered soils
   is largely a drainage phenomenon driven by the changing character of the
   boundary condition at the soil surface. Numerical simulations show that
   when rainfall ceases, the near-surface head gradient in a hillslope
   becomes nearly parallel to the slope as a simple consequence of the
   surfaces becoming a no-flow boundary, neglecting evaporation. During
   rainfall, infiltration is nearly vertical for most soils except those
   with high constant anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a quasi-physically based rainfall-runoff model is
   evaluated for a set of 72 events from a small upland catchment based
   upon two levels of characterization for overland flow plane geometry. In
   the first level of characterization there are 22 overland flow planes
   with average estimates of steady state infiltration rates based upon
   soil type. In the second level of characterization there are 145
   overland flow planes centered upon the locations of steady state
   infiltration mte measurement sites. Model performance is also evaluated
   for four different estimates of antecedent soil water content for a
   subset of 39 events for the more detailed overland flow plane
   characterization. The results show only slight improvements in model
   performance for the more detailed characterization of overland flow
   plane geometry and soil hydraulic property information.}},

Pages = {{2005-2010}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In a previous paper it was established that a simple relationship exists
   between the peak reduction ratio and the relative storage ratio of
   unregulated detention reservoirs.  The relationship, named the
   efficiency function of the reservoir, depends on the physical features
   of the reservoir and its outlet, and also on the shape of the inflow
   hydrograph.  For a specified type of reservoir and a given inflow
   hydrograph, the efficiency function predicts the storage volume needed
   to produce a desired peak flow reduction.  In this paper, it is
   demonstrated that it is possible to achieve the same peak flow reduction
   with a smaller reservoir if a parallel drain design is used.  In this
   design procedure the inflow hydrograph is split into two parts.  One
   part is routed through a detention reservoir and the second part is
   allowed to bypass the reservoir.  The two parts are recombined below the
   reservoir to form the outlet hydrograph which is the sum of two
   hydrographs with staggered peaks.  By a proper choice of the proportion
   of flow directed through the reservoir it is possible to achieve a
   desired peak flow reduction with a significant reduction in active
   storage.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic conductivity (K) variability in a sand and gravel aquifer on
   Cape Cod, Massachusetts, was measured and subsequently used in
   stochastic transport theories to estimate macrodispersivities.  Nearly
   1500 K measurements were obtained by borehole flowmeter tests and
   permeameter analyses of cores.  The geometric mean for the flowmeter
   tests (0.11cm/s) is similar to that estimated from other field tests. 
   The mean for the permeameter tests (0.035 cm/s) is significantly lower,
   possibly because of compaction of the cores.  The variance for the
   flowmeter (0.24) is also greater than that for the permeameter (0.14). 
   Geostatistical analyses applying negative exponential models with and
   without nuggets reveal similar spatial correlation structures for the
   two data sets.  Estimated correlation scales range from 2.9 to 8 m in
   the horizontal and from 0.18 to 0.38 m in the vertical.  Estimates of
   asymptotic longitudinal dispersivity (0.35-0.78 m) are similar in
   magnitude to that observed in the natural gradient tracer test (0.96 m)
   previously conducted at this site.}},

Title = {{SEASONAL RIVER RUNOFF CALCULATED FROM A GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC MODEL}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2029-2039}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A global atmospheric general circulation model is used to examine
   seasonal river runoff for the world's largest rivers.  The model's river
   runoff is not directly comparable to observed runoff at the mouth of a
   river basin because the model assumes that all runoff within a river's
   drainage basin reaches the river mouth instantaneously.  It is useful,
   however, to examine the model's monthly runoff to determine the extent
   to which it does agree with runoff as understood by hydrologists.  The
   runoff and precipitation for the river drainage basins are compared with
   observations.  For most river basins the model produces too much
   precipitation and runoff.  However, for the world's largest river, the
   Amazon, the mean annual runoff is less than half the observed.  A common
   characteristic of high-latitude rivers is a large runoff peak in the
   spring, primarily due to melting snow.  The model reproduces these peaks
   but generally leads the observed runoff by one month.  This arises
   because the model does not allow runoff to move between grid boxes but
   calculates only the total monthly runoff into the entire drainage basin.
   The runoff in dry river basins is poorly simulated by the model, in part
   because the precipitation is too large but also because the model's
   surface parameterizations do not accurately apportion the water lost
   between evapotranspiration and runoff.  The present version of the
   atmospheric model contains two soil layers and specifies the grid box
   runoff at each time step as a linear function of the soil moisture
   storage and the precipitation.  A more physically based model should
   improve the model's simulation of river runoff.  A model's ability to
   simulate monthly river runoff is a good test of its hydrologic cycle and
   surface parameterizations in different climatic regions and provides a
   useful diagnostic for climate modelers.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Four years of runoff measurement (29 events) in Kangussano, Mali, were
   analyzed on the basis of the partial area contribution concept.  The
   study region is semiarid and the use of runoff water to satisfy crop
   consumption is of high importance.  A first-order basin which included
   two flow channels draining an area of 1.14 10(6) ha (1.14 km2) was used
   for this purpose.  The objective of this study was to develop and test a
   conceptual model to predict runoff on natural catchments of about this
   size.  The model assumes that a basin is composed of a large number of
   pixels (satellite picture elements).  Each pixel covers an area of 900
   m2.  The hydraulic properties of a representative pixel are determined
   by runoff simulation experiments.  The model calculates the number of
   runoff generating pixels at a given time and rain depth.  The areal
   runoff is a product of these two factors.  Analysis of satellite images
   from LANDSAT and SPOT indicated similarities of soil cover complexes
   between the study area and an experimental area in Upper Volta.  Results
   of runoff simulation from this area were adapted for the study area and
   used for the calculations.  A good agreement between predicted and
   measured contributing area was obtained when the number of runoff
   generating pixels was 80 pixels/mm effective rain.  Predicted and
   measured hydrographs were also in good agreement.  It was therefore
   concluded that the model can satisfactorily predict actual hydrographs
   from data generated by rainfall-runoff simulators.  Dividing the
   watershed to surface elements of pixel's size makes the model capable of

Abstract = {{Previous work has shown that a one-dimensional water content-based
   finite difference algorithm can offer improved CPU efficiency in
   modeling infiltration into very dry heterogeneous soil when compared to
   similar pressure-based algorithms.  The usefulness of the water
   content-based method is limited, however, since it cannot be applied to
   saturated soils.  In this paper we develop two new methods which retain
   the advantages of water content-based methods while still permitting
   fully saturated conditions.  In the first method we define a new
   variable for the transformed Richards equation which has the
   characteristics of water content when soil is unsaturated and of
   pressure when soil is at or near saturation.  In addition to the
   transformed Richards' equation method, an improved pressure-based method
   which uses flux updating is presented.  Both methods are implemented in
   algorithms using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method equation
   solver.  The performance of the algorithms is compared to that of an
   algorithm based on a mixed form of Richards' equation using modified
   Picard iteration.  Two test cases are examined.  The first test case
   examines two-dimensional infiltration into very dry heterogeneous soil
   which remains unsaturated throughout the simulation period.  The second
   test case examines a two-dimensional developing perched water table. 
   Results indicate that the new methods retain the advantages of the water
   content-based method for fully unsaturated heterogeneous problems while
   allowing for fully saturated conditions.  For the unsaturated problem
   the new algorithms were from 16 to 59 times faster than the algorithm
   based on the mixed form of Richards' equation using modified Picard
   iteration.  For the saturated problem the new algorithms were from 6 to
   25 times faster than the mixed base algorithm.  Results also indicate
   that the performance of the mixed base algorithm could be significantly
   improved if a more effective adaptive time step were developed.}},

Abstract = {{A suitable equation for describing overland flow and the values for

   models.  The approaches to describe the flows and to estimate hydraulic

   and Manning n are widely used for shallow flows in surface irrigation
   although their suitability for such flows is questionable.  In this
   article the various flow equations are reviewed for their suitability to
   surface irrigation flows.  It is revealed that there are only a few

Abstract = {{A boundary integral formulation is developed for flow of two immiscible,
   incompressible phases in a porous medium.  With the boundary integral
   formulation, large computational domains may be considered with little
   impact on accuracy or computational effort, as the boundary integral
   mesh is placed only along contours of phase saturation and the domain
   boundaries.  Time stepping is performed by updating the position of the
   contours based on phase fluxes obtained with a total flux formulation. 
   Capillary pressure gradients are treated by interpolating saturation
   between contours using a separate boundary integral step; accordingly,
   the formulation is not restricted to the special form of the
   constitutive relationships implied in the quasi-linear approximation to
   unsaturated flow.  Examples of one-dimensional and radial two-phase flow
   are simulated, with excellent agreement to the corresponding analytical
   solutions.  Vertical imbibition of trichoroethylene into an initially
   pristine aquifer is simulated with both a finite element simulator and
   the boundary integral simulator, with good agreement between the two
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Increment cores were collected from trees growing at two sites where
   groundwater is contaminated by nickel.  Proton-induced X ray emission
   spectroscopy was used to determine the nickel concentrations in selected
   individual rings and in parts of individual rings.  Ring nickel
   concentrations were interpreted on the basis of recent concentrations of
   nickel in aquifers, historical information about site use activities,
   and model simulations of groundwater flow.  Nickel concentrations in
   rings increased during years of site use but not in trees outside the
   contaminated aquifers.  Consequently, it was concluded that trees may
   preserve in their rings an annual record of nickel contamination in
   groundwater.  Tulip trees and oaks contained higher concentrations of
   nickel than did sassafras, sweet gum, or black cherry.  No evidence was
   found that nickel accumulates consistently within parts of individual
   rings or that nickel is translocated across ring boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersion of a solute plume resulting from unsteady flow in
   three-dimensional, heterogeneous porous media was analyzed using
   stochastic continuum theory.  Asymptotic stochastic solutions of the
   perturbed unsteady flow and solute transport equations were used to
   construct the macroscopic dispersive flux and evaluate the resulting
   macrodispersivity tensor in terms of a three-dimensional, statistically
   anisotropic input covariance describing the hydraulic conductivity and
   an input covariance describing the temporal variability of the mean
   hydraulic gradient.  The flow equation was approximated by neglecting
   the influence of internal storage due to medium and fluid
   compressibility (specific storage, S(s) almost-equal-to 0).  The
   predictive expression for the macrodispersivity tensor is the sum of two
   components:  a spatial variability component identical to previous
   steady state theory and an unsteady component.  Two special cases of
   unsteady flow were examined:  variation only in the magnitude and
   variation only in the direction of the hydraulic gradient.  Gradient
   magnitude variation produces a slightly larger longitudinal
   macrodispersivity than does the steady flow case, whereas gradient
   direction variation produces a significantly larger transverse
   macrodispersivity.  Longitudinal and horizontal transverse
   macrodispersivities predicted with the unsteady stochastic theory were
   shown to be of a magnitude similar to observed values from the Borden,
   Cape Cod, and Columbus tracer experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical water balance model describing major hydrological
   processes operating within wet forested watersheds is proposed.  The
   model is capable of predicting hillslope and watershed discharge,
   evapotranspiration demands, hillslope moisture status, and surface and
   subsurface flow rates.  It is based on soil physical principles and
   requires the following input variables:  average hillslope angle and
   width, average soil depth, precipitation, average daily evaporation
   rates, effective saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil moisture holding
   capacity and initial moisture content.  These variables are often easily
   measured from field studies.  However, in some cases, the absence of
   field data may require that some of the variables in the model, e.g.,
   saturated hydraulic conductivity, be estimated or calibrated from
   hillslope hydrograph records.  The watershed model is composed of two
   submodels:  a storage model and a hillslope model.  The storage model
   describes the dynamic variation in water table elevation in recharge
   zones and the hillslope model is used to predict runoff and seepage
   through flow from surrounding hillsides.  Application of the model is
   illustrated on a small watershed located in North Madison, Connecticut.}},

Abstract = {{Surface contaminant plumes emanating from waste disposal facilities are
   often denser than the ambient groundwater.  Under certain conditions
   these dense plumes may become unstable, contaminating larger regions of
   an aquifer.  The behavior of contaminant plumes with different densities
   was examined in three flow containers packed with homogeneous porous
   media simulating unconfined aquifers.  Glass beads and a medium sand
   were used as the porous media.  A horizontal ambient groundwater stream
   was established in each flow container using deionized water.  The
   contaminant plumes consisted of NaI or NaBr solutions introduced into
   each flow container from a line source located on top of the porous
   medium and extending over the total width of the container.  Optical
   tracers were added to the salt solutions to allow flow visualization. 
   Results show that, for a given porous medium, dense plumes were either
   stable or unstable depending on the magnitude of the horizontal flow
   velocity, the contaminant leakage rate, and the density difference
   between the contaminant solution and the ambient groundwater.  When a
   dense plume becomes unstable, lobe-shaped gravitational instabilities
   develop which are unsteady and three dimensional.  Our experimental
   results suggest that the behavior of dense contaminant plumes overlying
   a less dense groundwater stream in a homogeneous porous medium depends
   on the magnitude of certain nondimensional parameters.  It appears that
   gravitational instabilities begin to develop when the values of these
   nondimensional parameters exceed certain critical values.}},

Abstract = {{A principal component stochastic dynamic programming algorithm for
   stochastic multireservoir hydropower system operation optimization was
   proposed by Saad and Turgeon (1988).  The dimension of the state space
   of the system is reduced by using only the major principal components of
   the system's state as determined by a principal component analysis of
   the results of a deterministic optimization.  A significant refinement
   of the procedure is to employ censored-data principal component
   analysis.  The more sophisticated statistical analysis provides a better
   model of the full dynamic range of the reservoir system's state,
   explains more observed variability of the reservoir volumes, and
   provides more accurate estimates of the statistical description's
   parameters.  In an example presented of a four-reservoir system, the
   first component of the censored-data principal component analysis, for a
   given month, explained all but 7\% of the uncensored system's
   variability, whereas the standard analysis for the same month left 12\%
   of the observed system's variability unexplained.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution describing the transport of dissolved substances
   in heterogeneous porous media with an asymptotic distance-dependent
   dispersion relationship has been developed.  The solution has a
   dispersion function which is linear near the origin (i.e., for short
   travel distances) and approaches an asymptotic value as the travel
   distance becomes infinite.  This solution can be used to characterize
   differences in the transport process relative to both the classical
   convection-dispersion equation which assumes that the hydrodynamic
   dispersion in the porous medium remains constant and a dispersion
   solution which has a strictly linear dispersion function.  The form of
   the hydrodynamic dispersion function used in the analytical solution is
   D(x) = alpha(x)upsilonBAR + D(diff), where alpha(x) = a L{[}1 -
   e(-bx/L)] and upsilonBAR is the average pore water velocity.  The
   proposed model may provide an alternate means for obtaining a
   description of the transport of solutes in heterogeneous porous media,
   when the scale dependence of the dispersion relationship follows the
   behavior given by alpha(x).  The overall behavior of the model is
   illustrated by several examples for constant concentration and flux
   boundary conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In turbulent boundary layer flows, shear velocity u{*} and roughness
   length z0 are commonly derived from semilogarithmic flow velocity
   profiles by fitting a straight line by ordinary least squares regression
   to the profile and calculating estimates of u{*} and z0 from the slope
   and intercept of the computed regression equation.  However, it is not
   clear from the literature whether the appropriate regression is of flow
   velocity u on the logarithm of height above the bed ln z or of ln z on
   u.  In order to calculate estimates of u{*} and z0, the true or
   structural relation between u and ln z must be established.  Because u
   is generally observed with much greater error than is ln z, the
   structural relation may be estimated by regressing u on ln z; regressing
   ln z on u is incorrect.  An analysis of 24 stream channel flow velocity
   profiles indicates that even in situations where the correlation between
   u and ln z exceeds 0.9, performing the incorrect regression can result
   in the considerable overestimation of u{*} and z0.}},

   case of households with linear demand functions and households with
   demand functions of constant elasticity.  It is shown that the economic
   cost of stringent time restrictions is greater than that for an

Abstract = {{Many multiple criteria decision making methods have been proposed and
   applied to water planning.  Their purpose is to provide information on
   tradeoffs among objectives and to help users articulate value judgments
   in a systematic, coherent, and documentable manner.  The wide variety of
   available techniques confuses potential users, causing inappropriate
   matching of methods with problems.  Experiments in which water planners
   apply more than one multicriteria procedure to realistic problems can
   help dispel this confusion by testing method appropriateness, ease of
   use, and validity.  We summarize one such experiment where U.S. Army
   Corps of Engineers personnel used several methods to screen urban water
   supply plans.  The methods evaluated include goal programming, ELECTRE
   I, additive value functions, multiplicative utility functions, and three
   techniques for choosing weights (direct rating, indifference tradeoff,
   and the analytical hierarchy process).  Among the conclusions we reach
   are the following.  First, experienced planners generally prefer
   simpler, more transparent methods.  Additive value functions are
   favored.  Yet none of the methods are endorsed by a majority of the
   participants; many preferred to use no formal method at all.  Second,
   there is strong evidence that rating, the most commonly applied weight
   selection method, is likely to lead to weights that fail to represent
   the trade-offs that users are willing to make among criteria.  Finally,
   we show that decisions can be as or more sensitive to the method used as
   to which person applies it.  Therefore, if who chooses is important,
   then so too is how a choice is made.}},

Abstract = {{The design of seasonal water quality management programs that allow
   different waste discharge rates during different periods of the year may
   require reliable long-term records of stream conditions.  A modified
   regionalized sensitivity analysis (RSA) is applied for assessing the
   effect of unreliable stream records on the design of such programs. 
   This approach is demonstrated for a seasonal waste discharge program
   that controls biochemical oxygen demand in a typical river basin.  Here
   the uncertain input parameters include flow and temperature data at
   different times in the year and at different locations in the stream. 
   An RSA is conducted for waste management scenarios that have different
   season length combinations and dissolved oxygen goals.  Results indicate
   that the design of a seasonal waste discharge program for this case
   study is generally more sensitive to uncertainty in summer flow and
   temperature data than to uncertainty in winter data.  Downstream flow
   data are shown to be more important than upstream data in low-flow
   periods, while upstream flows are also important in high-flow periods. 
   In addition, the degree to which uncertain stream conditions affect the
   management model outcome depends on the water quality goals of the
   governing agency and the length of the seasons examined.}},

Abstract = {{The two basic approaches for the assignment of coarse scale grid block
   permeabilities from highly detailed permeability descriptions are
   sampling, where the permeability of the coarse scale grid block is
   simply specified as the fine scale permeability evaluated at the grid
   block center (no averaging is performed), and scaleup or homogenization,
   where the coarse scale permeability is determined through some procedure
   which appropriately averages the fine scale data.  The intent of this
   paper is to quantitatively compare these two approaches, through
   extensive numerical calculations, for the modeling of single phase flow
   through two-dimensional realizations of randomly heterogeneous porous
   media, with heterogeneity quantified through the correlation length (l)
   and the variance of the log of permeability (sigma(phi)2).  Several
   different flow scenarios and two scaleup techniques (local and global)
   are considered over a range of l and sigma(phi).  It is seen that for
   flows driven by smoothly varying boundary conditions, a sampling
   procedure is more accurate than global scaleup when the length scale of
   a typical grid block is less than l, independent of sigma(phi).  For
   flows driven by source terms, by contrast, more resolution is required
   for a sampling approach to be preferable to global scaleup, particularly
   at high variances.  Local scaleup is shown to be preferable to either
   sampling or global scaleup in essentially all cases, though its use for
   more general permeability fields requires additional numerical
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{In this article an attempt is made to describe field scale solute
   transport parameters in terms of regional hydrologic and aquifer
   hydraulic properties, such as recharge rate, transmissivity, hydraulic
   gradient, aquifer thickness and soil porosity.  Aquifers subject to
   natural recharge from rainfall exhibit groundwater velocities which vary
   with distance and with the recharge intensity.  This in turn generates
   an evolving transport dispersion coefficient which increases with
   distance even in a homogeneous aquifer with constant dispersivity.  The
   dispersion equation in an aquifer subject to recharge and variable
   groundwater velocity is one with coefficients given as variable
   functions of distance.  A new stable analytical solution of this
   equation is presented along with numerical comparisons with the
   classical convection dispersion equation and sensitivity tests on the
   effect of hydrologic-hydraulic variables on the contaminant evolution. 
   It was found that the recharge rate substantially affects the
   contaminant distribution and may partially explain the scale dependence
   of dispersion parameters.  Transmissivity and hydraulic gradient values
   also determine the velocity distribution and therefore the rate of
   migration.  It would appear that constant, laboratory scale,
   dispersivities may be sufficient for the modeling of field scale
   concentrations if an equation which accounts for the effects of
   hydrologic and hydraulic variables is used.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is presented for identification of the permeability
   distribution in near-surface aquifers.  In addition to using the usual
   sparsely sampled pressure and permeability data, the method incorporates
   densely sampled seismic data, as obtained from a reflection or
   tomography survey, along with empirical relationships between seismic
   and hydraulic properties.  The procedure is to first estimate by
   hydrologic inversion a pressure field.  Then the
   velocity-permeability-pressure relationship is used to map the inverted
   pressure and measured seismic data to multivalued estimates of the
   permeability.  Of those, the most probable value, based on the
   hydrologic inversion, is selected.  In synthetic case studies the
   tremendous increase in coverage offered by the seismic data leads to
   dramatically better results in terms of both accuracy and resolution. 
   An appealing feature is the use of relatively easy to acquire pressure
   data; a second is the incorporation of geophysical data which can sample
   an entire aquifer remotely without the need for an expensive and
   invasive drilling program.}},

Abstract = {{Coupled steady state saturated-unsaturated flow from buried spherical
   cavities is investigated using a combined boundary element-finite
   element method.  Earlier work on such pressurized coupled flows has been
   for simple two-dimensional cavities.  The analysis of a simple
   three-dimensional flow allows the effect of dimensionality to be
   investigated.  Detailed results for a range of pressure heads and
   dimensionless cavity radii and the size of the saturated regions as a
   function of these two parameters is illustrated.  While these results
   show how greatly diminished the effect of gravity is in three as opposed
   to two dimensions, they also illustrate that the effect of gravity
   cannot in general be ignored.  The results indicate that the ratio of
   the total flow from a cavity under hydrostatic pressure to the flow
   obtained analytically by ignoring the water depth is just a linear
   function of the dimensionless cavity radius.  It is also shown that,
   while the size of the saturated region does not increase uniformly with
   the additional applied pressure, the relationship between the total flux
   from the cavity and the applied pressure is linear.}},

Abstract = {{In modeling periodic hydrologic series, the amplitudes and phase angles
   of the harmonics reflect the magnitudes and timing of the seasonal
   peaks.  Demodulation-remodulation captures the temporal variations in
   these stochastic parameters, thereby providing useful information and
   more accurate models than traditional Fourier series models. 
   Unfortunately, this technique has been neglected by hydrologic modelers.
   In this paper, application of the technique to a synthetic series
   validates the theory.  The technique is then applied to the streamflow
   record of the Uda Walawe River which exhibits a strong bimodal annual
   pattern.  Fourteen models are developed, providing a comparison between
   moving average filters commonly used in demodulation studies, the
   Fourier filter used in Fourier series analysis, and composite models
   which incorporate both filters.  In addition, the development of a
   prototype forecasting filter demonstrates the viability of using
   demodulation-remodulation for forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional numerical model is developed for simulating the
   biodegradation and transport of benzene and toluene in the subsurface
   environment.  Modeled processes include mass exchange between the
   constituent phases (solid, liquid, gas, and biomass), advective and
   dispersive transport, and biotransformation, as well as microbial
   biomass production.  Two substrates, two electron acceptors, one trace
   nutrient, and two microbial populations are modeled.  Resulting
   governing equations include five nonlinear partial differential
   equations describing component transport in the bulk pore fluids, five
   nonlinear algebraic equations governing interphase mass exchange, and
   two ordinary differential equations governing microbial growth.  These
   equations are solved through application of a Galerkin finite element
   method and a set iterative solution scheme.  The utility and validity of
   the modeling approach is explored through comparisons with laboratory
   column experiments.  Model parameters were estimated independently
   through laboratory batch experiments, aquifer slurry studies, or from
   the literature.  Simulations are found to provide reasonable agreement
   with measurements of benzene and toluene biodegradation in saturated
   continuous-flow columns packed with aquifer material.  Sensitivity
   analyses and comparisons with column data suggest that model predictions
   are highly dependent upon the microbial parameters, particularly the
   initial active biomass concentration, the maximum specific substrate
   utilization rate, and the half-saturation coefficient.  The importance
   of the accurate estimation of these microbial parameters is emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Salt is the proposed host rock for geologic repositories of nuclear
   waste in several nations because it is ``dry{''} and probably
   ``impermeable.{''}  To evaluate the safety of nuclear waste disposal in
   salt, it is necessary to calculate the rate of release of nuclides from
   solidified waste form and to predict the transport of released
   radionuclides.  Our objective is to develop analytic methods for such
   prediction, based on mass transfer theory.  First, we present an
   analysis of pressure-driven brine migration.  After consolidation, brine
   migration analyzed by these equations and using the particular set of
   parameter values is of a small magnitude, with Darcy velocities of the
   order of micrometers per year.  Brine migration in consolidated salt is
   very localized, within a few meters from the waste package, and highly
   transient.  We have analyzed diffusion of radionuclides near waste
   packages in a salt repository, using analytic equations for low Peclet
   systems.  According to this analysis it is unlikely that any
   low-solubility species will have difficulty meeting the U.S. Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission release rate requirement at the bare waste/salt
   interface.  We have also analyzed the role that an interbed might play
   in being a preferential pathway for radionuclide migration.  We
   calculate the diffusive mass fluxes from an infinitely long bare waste
   cylinder in salt, facing an interbed.  The fractional release rates of
   solubility-limited species into the interbed are low for the parameter
   values used in the numerical illustrations.}},

   and December 1984 from 31 stream bank sites representing three types of
   near-surface water flow:  matrix through flow, nonmatrix through flow,
   and overland flow.  Bacterial concentrations in matrix through flow were
   found to be very low, but much higher input rates were found in both
   nonmatrix through flow and overland flow.  Overland flow sites were the
   most important group for the input of bacteria to the channel, both
   between and during storm events.  The rate of fecal coliform input was
   found to increase during storm events, and there was a strong, positive
   correlation between bacterial input rate and stream stage height.}},

Abstract = {{This paper and its companion (Ashworth et al., this issue) discuss
   measurements of channel change and associated flow and sediment
   transport processes in a representative chute-and-bar reach within a
   proglacial gravel-bed river, the Sunwapta River in the Canadian Rockies.
   During a week in which water discharge through the reach increased the
   decreased, a sediment wave passed into and partly along the reach.  At
   first the chute aggraded, then sediment was eroded from the chute and
   deposited in a prograding lobe to one side of the original bar head
   between two distributaries.  Measurements of velocity, shear stress, and
   gravel transport rate revealed day-to-day changes in the divergent
   pattern of flow and sediment transport.  The off-center location of the
   lobe reflected an initial asymmetry in the pattern of flow and sediment
   transport, but as the lobe grew, the flow and transport gradually
   switched away to the other distributary.  Width-averaged bed load
   transport rates do not agree well with average rates inferred from bar
   head deposition or from volumes and spatial patterns of scour and fill;
   the indirect estimates are considered more reliable than those based on
   direct sampling for necessarily brief durations.  By the end of the
   study the new lobe had almost accreted onto the original bar head,
   supporting the idea that most braid bars are of compound origin. 
   Temporal and spatial patterns in grain size distributions of the bed,
   bed load, and deposited sediment are discussed in the companion paper.}},

Abstract = {{Grain size distribution of bed material, bed load, and bar head
   deposition were sampled during the evolution of a chute and lobe in the
   braided gravel bed Sunwapta River, Alberta.  Although bed shear stress
   and total bed load transport rate varied substantially within the reach
   and from day to day (Ferguson et al., this issue), the median diameter
   D50 of bed load was remarkably constant.  The bed initially fined from
   chute to bar head but became more uniform.  Sediment deposited on the
   bar head also had a near constant D50, similar to that of the bed load
   truncated at the same lower size limit.  Both load and deposition were
   finer on average than the bed, suggesting overall selective transport
   despite little sign of local sorting.  In contrast to median diameters,
   maximum sizes (D(max)) of sediment in motion and deposited on the bar
   head varied substantially and showed a weak but significant dependence
   on shear stress.  Inferring selective entrainment from this evidence
   alone would be dubious because D(max) was also found to increase
   systematically with the mass of sediment sampled.  However, two
   different methods of analysis of fractional transport rates throughout
   the size range also showed size-selective entrainment and transport.  In
   the marginal transport conditions of this study, size sorting appears to
   occur but only weakly and mainly in the coarser fractions.}},

Abstract = {{An infinite slope stability model is proposed which incorporates changes
   in root cohesion and vegetation surcharge through several timber
   management cycles along with the stochastic influence of rainfall on
   pore water pressure. Recovery of rooting strength and tree surcharge
   following timber harvest are simulated by a sigmoid relationship, while
   root deterioration of harvested vegetation is described by an
   exponential decay function. The effects of long-term timber management
   on probability of failure are simulated by overlaying the impacts of a
   prior vegetation removal on a more recent removal. For each year the
   critical pore water pressure (u(crit)) needed to trigger slope failure
   is computed. An empirical function relating piezometric level to
   antecedent rainfall, storm intensity, and total precipitation is
   presented to assess the probability of occurrence of u(crit), based on
   historical rainfall records for a site in coastal Alaska. Simulations of
   probability of failure indicate that alternate thinnings and clear-cuts
   and clear-cuts alone produce less stable conditions than shelterwood
   harvesting systems and partial cuts. Repeated harvestign cycles with
   progressively shorter rotations, reduced regeneration potential on new
   vegetation, and destruction of understory vegetation during logging or
   site preparation can all increase the probability of failure. These
   analyses can provide land managers with options for acceptable
   vegetation management strategies on potentially unstable hillslopes.}},

Abstract = {{Core scale estimates of soil parameters of the Gardner-Russo and van
   Genuchten models of the hydraulic conductivity and water retention
   functions were obtained for 417 undisturbed soil cores taken from a wall
   of a trench (20 m long, 2.5 m deep), using a a procedure based on
   inverse problem methodology.  These estimates were used to evaluate the
   first two statistical moments of the underlying random space functions
   (RSFs), using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation procedure,
   coupled with the weighted least squares procedure, to estimate
   parameters of models of the covariance and the drift functions of the
   pertinent RSFs.  The fitted models were used to evaluate the mean and
   covariance functions of the hydraulic conductivity and water rentention
   functions for given water saturations.  Covariance functions of
   log-saturated conductivity (log K(s)) and the ``shape{''} parameters of
   the Gardner-Russo and van Genuchten models exhibited statistical
   anisotropy characterized by aspect ratios that vary between 3 to 4. 
   Correlation scales of log K(s) were larger than those of the ``shape{''}
   parameters.  Consequently, the product of the variance of log
   unsaturated conductivity and its correlation scale remained essentially
   invariant for a considerable range of water saturation.  The
   implications of these results regarding stochastic modeling of transport
   in heterogeneous porous formations and possible applications of the
   results of this study are discussed briefly.}},

Abstract = {{Migration of radionuclides in the fracture of a host rock matrix
   surrounding a high-level waste repository is discussed in terms of two
   coupled one-dimensional equations, one for the fracture and the other
   for the porous rock matrix.  The processes considered are advection,
   dispersion, radioactive decay and adsorption on the surface of the
   fracture, and diffusion, radioactive decay and adsorption in the
   microfissures of the host rock.  The temporal and spatial distribution
   of concentration and flux at the outlet of the fracture for some typical
   radionuclides encountered in high-level radioactive waste has been
   computed using two-component leaching from the waste matrix and
   budgeting the total inventory.  It is observed that the concentration of
   Sr-90 and Pu-239 markedly decreases with distance along the fracture due
   to sorption and decay.  However, either travel time or sorption do not
   present enough delay for significant decay of I-129 in fracture water. 
   While the peak flux of I-129 shows insignificant variation at different
   fracture lengths for varied fracture apertures, that of Pu-239 has
   functional dependence on both parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach is applied to the problem of modeling solute transport
   accompanied by many chemical reactions.  The approach, based on concepts
   of the concentration space and its stoichiometric subspaces, uses
   elements of the subspaces as primary dependent variables.  It is shown
   that the resulting model equations are compact in form, isolate the
   chemical reaction expressions from flow expressions, and can be used for
   either equilibrium or kinetically controlled reactions.  The
   implications of the results on numerical algorithms for solving the
   equations are discussed.  The application of the theory is illustrated
   throughout with examples involving a simple but broadly representative
   set of reactions previously considered in the literature.  Numerical
   results are presented for four interconnected reactions:  a homogeneous
   complexation reaction, two sorption reactions, and a
   dissolution/precipitation reaction.  Three cases are considered:  (1)
   four kinetically controlled reactions, (2) four equilibrium-controlled
   reactions, and (3) a system with two kinetically controlled reactions
   and two equilibrium-controlled reactions.}},

Abstract = {{A critical review of dispersivity observations from 59 different field
   sites was developed by compiling extensive tabulations of information on
   aquifer type, hydraulic properties, flow configuration, type of
   monitoring network, tracer, method of data interpretation, overall scale
   of observation and longitudinal, horizontal transverse and vertical
   transverse dispersivities from original sources.  This information was
   then used to classify the dispersivity data into three reliability
   classes.  Overall, the data indicate a trend of systematic increase of
   the longitudinal dispersivity with observation scale but the trend is
   much less clear when the reliability of the data is considered.  The
   longitudinal dispersivities ranged from 10(-2) to 10(4) m for scales
   ranging from 10(-1) to 10(5) m, but the largest scale for high
   reliability data was only 250 m.  When the data are classified according
   to porous versus fractured media there does not appear to be any
   significant difference between these aquifer types.  At a given scale,
   the longitudinal dispersivity values are found to range over 2-3 orders
   of magnitude and the higher reliability data tend to fall in the lower
   portion of this range.  It is not appropriate to represent the
   longitudinal dispersivity data by a single universal line.  The
   variations in dispersivity reflect the influence of differing degrees of
   aquifer heterogeneity at different sites.  The data on transverse
   dispersivities are more limited but clearly indicate that vertical
   transverse dispersivities are typically an order of magnitude smaller
   than horizontal transverse dispersivities.  Reanalyses of data from
   several of the field sites show that improved interpretations most often
   lead to smaller dispersivities.  Overall, it is concluded that
   longitudinal dispersivities in the lower part of the indicated range are
   more likely to be realistic for field applications.}},

Abstract = {{An alternative quantification of the scaling properties of river channel
   networks is explored using a spatial network model.  Whereas scaling
   descriptions of drainage networks previously have been presented using a
   fractal analysis primarily of the channel lengths, we illustrate the
   scaling of the surface area of the channels defining the network pattern
   with an exponent which is independent of the fractal dimension but not
   of the fractal nature of the network.  The methodology presented is a
   fat fractal analysis in which the drainage basin minus the channel area
   is considered the fat fractal.  Random channel networks within a fixed
   basin area are generated on grids of different scales.  The sample
   channel networks generated by the model have a common outlet of fixed
   width and a rule of upstream channel narrowing specified by a diameter
   branching exponent using hydraulic and geomorphologic principles. 
   Scaling exponents are computed for each sample network on a given grid
   size and are regressed against network magnitude.  Results indicate that
   the size of the exponents are related to magnitude of the networks and
   generally decrease as network magnitude increases.  Cases showing
   differences in scaling exponents with like magnitudes suggest a
   direction of future work regarding other topologic basin characteristics
   as potential explanatory variables.}},

   environment, the deeper soil horizons which provide base flow, was
   identified from the mixing model, but its chemistry was assumed to be
   invariant during the forecast period, and hence it was not included in
   MAGIC.  This mixing model identified soil environments that appear to be
   important in determining present stream water chemistry, determined the
   hydrologic routing parameters necessary for the model, and permitted
   predictions of stream water chemistry during future storm events. 
   Annual average stream water acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) was
   predicted to decrease during the next 50 years in a manner largely
   consistent with a regional analysis of the nearby southern Blue Ridge
   province performed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  The two
   upper soil layers, however, were predicted to acidify substantially
   within the next 20 years so that the stream water may become unsuitable
   for sensitive aquatic biota for much of the year, despite a positive
   annual average ANC.  This approach, which combines a predictive model
   and a mixing model, provides testable hypotheses because actual soil
   environments are modeled; field experiments to test the processes
   contained in the model are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Late winter sampling of snowpack depth and density was conducted in five
   subarctic forest and forest-tundra landscape types north of the east arm
   of Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories between March 28 and April 9,
   1990.  Tree and sampling density were nonnormal in distribution in study
   sites with stems < 1500 ha-1, and normally distributed in dense forest. 
   For the Hoarfrost River area, average snow depth, density, and water
   equivalent were 40.7 +/- 7.9 cm, 0.17 +/- 0.05 g cm-3, and 6.58 +/- 1.99
   cm, respectively.  Variation in snowpack depth and density was low
   within each site, indicative of relatively homogeneous snow conditions. 
   Snow density was negatively correlated with tree stem density.  For the
   Hoarfrost River area, both snow depth and variability in snow density
   increased with tree stem density.  Variability in snow depth increased
   with variability in snow density.  Snow depth was more variable in
   forest-tundra than in forest sites.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies have attempted econometric estimation of the effect of
   changing groundwater costs on various dimensions of agricultural
   behavior. These studies assume parametric cost values, ignoring the
   possibility that marginal pumping costs may be endogenous to the extent
   of pumping activity. Under the alternative assumption of increasing
   marginal pumping costs, existing estimates of various elasticities may
   be suspect due to specification bias. This paper investigates this
   possibility, modeling a pumping technology based on hydrologic
   principles which incorporates constant pumping costs as a limiting case.
   The model also allows for common pool externalities when agents pump
   groundwater from the same aquifer. The results of the econometric
   analysis strongly suggest the presence of increasing marginal pumping
   costs for farmers in our data sample.}},

Abstract = {{Expressions for the macroscopic velocity vector and dispersion tensor
   for sorbing solute transport in heterogeneous porous formations whose
   hydrogeologic properties are repeated at intervals were derived via
   Taylor-Aris-Brenner moment analysis. An idealized three-dimensional
   porous formation of infinite domain with spatially periodic retardation
   factor, velocity field, and microdispersion coefficients in all three
   directions was considered. Sorption was assumed to be governed by a
   linear equilibrium isotherm under local chemical equilibrium conditions.
   The analytical expressions presented are based on a perturbation method
   where all of the spatially periodic parameters employed were assumed to
   have ``small{''} fluctuations. It was shown that the effective velocity
   vector is given by the volume-averaged interstitial velocity vector
   divided by the volume-averaged retardation factor, and the effective
   dispersion dyadic (second-order tensor) is given by the volume-averaged
   microdispersion dyadic divided by the volume-averaged dimensionless
   retardation factor plus a dyadic expressing the increase in solute
   spreading caused by the spatial variability of the parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations are used to (1) investigate the accuracy of
   approximations that are implicit in first-order stochastic dispersion
   theories and (2) identify the accuracy limits of first-order dispersion
   theories in isotropic porous media. The Fickian theory of Gelhar and
   Axness (1983), as well as the Fickian and non-Fickian theories of Dagan
   (1984) and Neuman and Zhang (1990) are investigated. All Monte Carlo
   simulations are in three dimensions. Confidence limits of
   ensemble-averaged Monte Carlo results in isotropic porous media are
   established for 0.1 less-than-or-equal-to sigma(Y) less-than-or-equal-to
   1.5. These results showed that first-order theoretical estimates of the
   Eulerian velocity covariance function are quite accurate for sigma(Y) <
   1; theoretical estimates of the non-Fickian longitudinal dispersivity do
   not deviate significantly from theory for at least sigma(Y)
   less-than-or-equal-to 1.5; theoretical estimation of the transverse
   dispersivity is limited to sigma(Y) < 1; and, the Fickian longitudinal
   dispersivity is overestimated by the theory of Gelhar and Axness (1983).
   Of all first-order dispersion theories, the theory of Dagan (1984) is
   most robust in estimating the dispersivity tensor.}},

   CALIBRATE A GROUNDWATER-FLOW MODEL}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{A new technique is employed to calibrate a regional-scale groundwater
   flow model to an extensive data base of undisturbed (i.e., assumed to be
   steady state) and transient heads. The methodology presented in this
   study is similar in concept to one presented by de Marsily et al. (1984)
   in that an adjoint sensitivity technique is coupled with a kriging
   algorithm to calibrate a flow model. The notable difference of the
   methodology presented in this paper is that it directly identifies the
   regions where modification of the model's kriged transmissivity or
   boundary pressure values will directly improve the overall fit between
   measured and model-calculated heads at selected wells. At the locations
   identified as most sensitive to transmissivity changes, synthetic
   transmissivity values, referred to as pilot points, are added to the
   transmissivity data base and used as input for kriging the
   transmissivity field. An application of the methodology to data
   originating from approximately 10 years of regional hydrogeologic site
   characterization efforts that have been conducted in the Culebra
   dolomite at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in southeastern New Mexico
   is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The linear programming gradient (LPG) method originally proposed by
   Alperovits and Shamir (1977) and the subsequent publications based on it
   are briefly reviewed. The optimal solutions obtained by different
   investigators for a simple two-loop network, originally taken by
   Alperovits and Shamir as an illustrative example, are compared and it is
   shown that they are not even the local optimum solutions. The latest
   modification, introduced by Kessler and Shamir (1989), which
   incorporates the projected gradient of the objective function, is also
   briefly reviewed and is shown to lead to a truly local optimum solution
   as claimed by Kessler and Shamir. It is shown that it is preferable
   initially to suppress the minimum link flow constraint, necessary for
   reliability purposes, and introduce it later after obtaining the optimal
   solution for a branching configuration. The philosophy of the LPG method
   is analyzed. It is shown that the LPG method is inefficient, at least
   for optimization of the illustrative two-loop network, as compared to a
   heuristic method that initially identifies logically good branching
   configurations for obtaining the optimal solution.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variations in the composition of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) in stream and soil water of the acidified Birkenes
   catchment were studied during summer and autumn 1990, Hydrophobic and
   hydrophilic acids were the dominant fractions in the soils (dominated by
   podzols and peats) and brook, accounting for approximately 90\% of total
   DOC. The podzol displayed a vertical gradation of DOC fractions, with
   hydrophobic acids dominating in the O horizon (approximately 65\%) and
   hydrophilic acids dominating in the E and B horizons (approximately
   60\%). In the bogs, hydrophilic acids were the dominant fraction at all
   depths. Temporal variations in the relative contributions of the various
   DOC fractions were most pronounced in the podzol O horizon and the brook
   during successive autumn rainstorms, and small in the mineral soils and
   bogs. In the brook, DOC increases at peak discharge were dominated by
   hydrophilic acids. If stream water was assumed to be a conservative
   mixture of water from the podzol O and B horizons and from the deeper
   layers in the bog surrounding the stream, 92\% of the variability in the
   concentration of hydrophobic and hydrophilic acids in the stream could
   be explained. This mixing analysis suggested that base flow largely
   originated in the deeper layers of the bogs, while peak flow was
   primarily made up of B horizon (approximately 50-65\%) and O horizon
   (approximately 35-50\%) water.}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation from Williams Lake, computed by the energy budget method for
   the five open-water seasons of 1982-1986, varied from a maximum seasonal
   rate of 0.282 cm/d in 1983 to a minimum seasonal rate of 0.219 cm/d in
   1982. The pattern of monthly values of evaporation is not consistent
   from year to year. The normally expected pattern of low evaporation
   values in May, followed by increasing values in June to maximum values
   in July is true for only 3 of the 5 years. Comparison of annual
   evaporation calculated by the energy budget and mass transfer methods
   indicates that energy budget values varied from 13\% greater to 11\%
   less than mass transfer values. Furthermore, there is no seasonal bias
   in the pattern. Large differences exist in the magnitude of energy
   fluxes to and from Williams Lake. By far the greatest energy fluxes,
   having magnitudes of hundreds of watts per square meter, are incoming
   solar radiation, incoming atmospheric radiation, and outgoing long-wave
   radiation emitted by the lake water. The least energy fluxes are related
   to advection, which generally have magnitudes less than 5 W m-2.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of the hydraulic head and velocity components of the
   transient groundwater flow in an unconfined compressible aquifer of
   finite thickness under constant uniform circular recharge are obtained
   from the linearized mathematical model by the use of integral
   transforms. The result generalizes Dagan's (1967) solution which was
   derived by neglecting the compressibility. By treating the
   compressibility parameter as a small value, the formula for the
   hydraulic head is analyzed by asymptotic methods, resulting in
   approximations to the exact solutions for the head and velocities on
   small and large time scales. The hydraulic head and flow velocities can
   be accurately approximated by Dagan's formula for large times; for small
   times, neglecting the compressibility gives a large relative error but
   small absolute error.}},

Abstract = {{Natural waters in ridge provinces of Florida and southeast Georgia were
   classified geographically, by degrees of cultural disturbance. and
   according to the dominant hydrologic and biogeochemical processes
   controlling chemistry. The ionic composition of lakes, upland streams,
   and surficial aquifer (water table) springs in relatively undeveloped
   catchments reflects the geographic variations in bulk deposition
   corrected for evapotranspiration (Na, Cl), plus a slight gain (net
   watershed mobilization) of Mg, and partial to nearly complete losses
   (net retention) of nitrate, sulfate, Ca, and K. Recharge to the Floridan
   aquifer in infertile, forested. sandy ridge provinces of northern
   Florida contains 360-580-mu-mol CO2. On the basis of indirect
   geochemical evidence, sulfate retention appears less important in lake
   sediments than in the region's highly weathered, ferruginous,
   kaolinitic, sand soils. Silica concentrations in upland streams and
   water table springs closely reflect the predicted equilibrium between
   kaolinite and gibbsite. Along with other evidence, the Si concentrations
   in ridge lakes indicate that seepage inflow is much more important than
   assumed in Baker et al.'s (1988) regional model. Lakes and streams are
   acidified either by humic acids or nonmarine sulfate but rarely by both,
   as reflected by the significant inverse correlation between these two
   components. Contrary to previous reports, there is no significant
   difference in alkalinity for culturally undisturbed lakes in the
   northern Trail versus southern Highlands Ridge areas.}},

Abstract = {{A critical issue in parametric methods of frequency analysis, regardless
   of the phenomenon being modeled. is that of selection of a form of
   probability distribution to be applied. When one is interested in
   continuous distributions there exists little theoretical guidance, other
   than perhaps that provided by the central limit theorem or the
   (asymptotic) results of extreme value theory, upon which one may base a
   choice. This paper, in a very general way, introduces a whole new class
   of probability models which are referred to as distributions of
   fractional order statistics. The potential efficacies of various member
   distributions within the class for hydrologic data analysis are also
   rationalized in a verv intuitive way. Considered in some detail is an
   application of the theory of fractional order statistics to generalize
   the Gaussian distribution. Monte Carlo results comparing the performance
   of the generalized distribution with other common hydrologic models are
   also set forth.}},

Title = {{NATURAL DENITRIFICATION IN THE SATURATED ZONE - A REVIEW}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1657-1668}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Denitrification is increasingly recognized for its ability to eliminate
   or reduce nitrate concentrations in groundwater. With this awareness
   comes a desire to predict the rate and extent of denitrification in
   aquifers. The limiting factor in making predictive models, however, is
   our limited knowledge of the physical characteristics of this process.
   This review synthesizes the published literature on natural aquifer
   denitrification. A background section discusses denitrification
   requirements and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, which
   occurs in environments similar to those where denitrification occurs,
   and gives a historical perspective on denitrification. Other sections
   discuss denitrification with organic carbon serving as the electron
   donor (heterotrophic denitrification) and with reduced inorganic
   compounds serving as the electron donor (autotrophic denitrification).
   The section on heterotrophic denitrification is structured around two
   tables that summarize natural aquifer denitrification rates reported by
   laboratory studies and natural aquifer denitrification rates reported by
   field studies. The section on autotrophic denitrification discusses
   denitrification with reduced iron and reduced sulfur. Thus far, most
   studies only consider a single electron donor or donor type, whether
   heterotrophic or autotrophic. This review demonstrates, however, that
   multiple electron donors may be present in a given aquifer. Future
   research efforts are recommended to determine the factors affecting the
   availability of electron donors and their denitrification rates.
   Additional research is also suggested on how dissolved oxygen affects
   denitrification rates and on the factors influencing the partitioning of
   nitrate reduction products to nitrous oxide, a potential contributor to
   the destruction of the ozone layer, and to ammonium.}},

Abstract = {{The fifth intensive field campaign of FIFE (First ISLSCP Field
   Experiment (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project))
   was conducted in northeastern Kansas during late summer 1989, in order
   to study the dry down of a surface with prairie vegetation prior to
   senescence and dormancy. As precipitation became sparse and rare, the
   surface developed nonuniform features at the scales of the rainfall
   events. Nevertheless, lower boundary layer measurements used together
   with remotely sensed surface temperatures on the basis of Monin-Obukhov
   similarity allowed the estimation of the flux of sensible heat for a
   region with characteristic dimensions of 10(4) M. In contrast, under
   these conditions it was difficult to aggregate an array of local flux
   measurements into a true regional mean. On account of the same problem
   in the aggregation of local measurements of net radiation and ground
   heat flux, the reliability of the estimation of regional evaporation by
   the energy budget method was hard to assess.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal infrared radiances recorded by the thematic mapper of the
   Landsat 5 satellite, in combination with wind velocity and temperature
   profiles recorded by radiosondes, were used to derive surface fluxes of
   sensible heat during the First International Satellite Land Surface
   Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE). FIFE was conducted
   in 1987 and 1989 in a strongly dissected tallgrass prairie area of the
   Flint Hills in northeastern Kansas. The scale of the surface temperature
   measurements was made compatible with the effective fetch of the
   boundary layer profile measurements by aggregation. The methods of
   calculation were based on known Monin-Obukhov flux-profile relationships
   and on bulk similarity formulations for the atmospheric boundary layer.
   The surface temperatures were used both with and without atmospheric
   correction. The latent heat fluxes (evaporation) were derived from those
   of sensible heat by means of the energy budget. The calculated fluxes
   were generally in good agreement with the means of the fluxes measured
   in the field by all (22 in 1987 and 14 in 1989) ground stations in the
   15 x 15 km experimental area.}},

Abstract = {{The feed forward (FF) method derives efficient operational equations for
   simulating transport of reacting solutes. It has been shown to be
   applicable in the presence of networks with any number of homogeneous
   and/or heterogeneous, classical reaction segments that consist of three,
   at most binary participants. Using a sequential (network type after
   network type) exploration approach and, independently, theoretical
   explanations, it is demonstrated for networks with classical reaction
   segments containing more than three, at most binary participants that if
   any one of such networks leads to a solvable transport problem then the
   FF method is applicable. Ways of helping to avoid networks that produce
   problem insolvability are developed and demonstrated. A previously
   suggested algebraic, matrix rank procedure has been adapted and
   augmented to serve as the main, easy-to-apply solvability test for
   already postulated networks. Four network conditions that often generate
   insolvability have been identified and studied. Their early detection
   during network formulation may help to avoid postulation of insolvable
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional variable aperture fracture network model for flow
   and transport in fractured rocks was developed. The model generates both
   the network of fractures and the variable aperture distribution of
   individual fractures in the network. Before solving for the flow and
   transport of the whole network, a library of single-fracture
   permeabilities and particle transport residence time spectra is first
   established. The spatially varying aperture field within an individual
   fracture plane is constructed by geostatistical methods. Then the flow
   pattern, the fracture transmissivity, and the residence times for
   transport of particles through each fracture are calculated. The library
   of transmissivities and frequency distributions of residence times is
   used for all fractures in the network by a random selection procedure.
   The solution of flow through the fracture network and the
   particle-tracking calculation of solute transport for the whole network
   are derived from one side of the network to the other. The model thus
   developed can handle flow and transport from the single-fracture scale
   to the multiple-fracture scale. The single-fracture part of the model is
   consistent with earlier laboratory tests and field observations. The
   multiple-fracture aspect of the model was verified in the constant
   aperture fracture limit with an earlier code. The simulated breakthrough
   curves obtained from the model display dispersion on two different
   scales as has been reported from field experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The finite layer method (FLM) is an extension of the finite strip method
   familiar in structural engineering. The idea behind the method is to
   discretize two space dimensions using truncated Fourier series,
   approximating variations in the third via finite elements. The
   eigenfunctions used in the Fourier expansions are orthogonal, and,
   consequently, the Galerkin integrations decouple the weighted residual
   equations associated with different Fourier modes. The method therefore
   reduces three-dimensional problems to sets of independent matrix
   equations that one can solve either sequentially on a microcomputer or
   concurrently on a parallel processor. The latter capability makes the

Abstract = {{An objective, data-based method for partitioning evapotranspiration (ET)
   measurements into soil and plant contributions is proposed and applied
   to a semiarid shortgrass steppe site in northeastern Colorado. This
   method requires fairly standard micrometeorological/surface energy
   balance measurements and relies on a two-source Penman-Monteith model of
   ET and a submodel (proposed and developed in this study) that relates
   the soil evaporation resistance to the soil Bowen ratio. Assuming that
   these soil parameters do not vary much during any given day, their daily
   values are determined by an optimization procedure which exploits the
   diurnal change in the meteorological data. Once the soil resistance and
   soil Bowen ratio are determined, the available energy and the ET data
   are partitioned into soil and plant components and then the canopy
   resistance and the within-canopy aerodynamic resistance (herein referred
   to as the subcanopy resistance) are determined. Comparisons between the
   present results and other observations made in the shortgrass steppe
   ecosystem provide support for the validity of the present methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the optimization of water storage of small-scale
   dams (tanks) found in the semiarid regions of Asia. The focus is on
   monsoonal water storage in small tank systems in Sri Lanka, and in
   particular on optimal extraction for supplementary irrigation under
   double cropping, also allowing for nonirrigation uses of storage. The
   problem of intraseasonal allocation of storage for irrigation is solved
   by deterministic dynamic programming (DP) using simulated crop response
   functions. An approach to solving the optimal interseasonal allocation
   problem is demonstrated by operating in sequence the DP models for the
   two seasons. An important feature is the generation and use of seasonal
   water response functions with respect to each cropping season ensuring
   optimality in both crop area and intraseasonal distribution of
   irrigation. The determination of the scarcity value of water in this
   framework is also illustrated. Our results show that in most years both
   the optimal conservation of storage from the wet season and the optimal
   area of irrigation in the dry season are much higher than the current
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Operation of reservoir systems using stochastic dynamic programming
   (SDP) and Bayesian decision theory (BDT) is investigated in this study.
   The proposed model, called Bayesian stochastic dynamic programming
   (BSDP), which includes inflow, storage, and forecast as state variables,
   describes streamflows with a discrete lag 1 Markov process, and uses BDT
   to incorporate new information by updating the prior probabilities to
   posterior probabilities, is used to generate optimal reservoir operating
   rules. This continuous updating can significantly reduce the effects of
   natural and forecast uncertainties in the model. In order to test the
   value of the BSDP model for generating optimal operating rules,
   real-time reservoir operation simulation models are constructed using 95
   years of monthly historical inflows of the Gunpowder River to Loch Raven
   reservoir in Maryland. The rules generated by the BSDP model are applied
   in an operation simulation model and their performance is compared with
   an alternative stochastic dynamic programming (ASDP) model and a
   classical stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) model. BSDP differs from
   the other two models in the selection of state variables and the way the
   transition probabilities are formed and updated.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic optimization model for containment of a plume of
   groundwater contamination through the installation and operation of
   pumping wells is developed. It considers explicitly uncertainty about
   hydraulic conductivity in the aquifer and seeks to minimize the expected
   total cost of operating the pumping wells plus the recourse cost
   incurred when containment of the contaminant plume is not achieved. Four
   different formulations of the model are examined, ranging from simply
   replacing all uncertain parameters by their expected values to a full
   stochastic programming with recourse model involving nonsymmetric linear
   quadratic penalty functions. The full stochastic programming with
   recourse model, which minimizes the expected total costs over a number
   of realizations of outcomes of the random parameters, is nonlinear and
   possibly nonconvex and is solved by an extension of the finite
   generation algorithm. The value of information about the uncertain
   parameters is defined through the differences between the values of the
   optimal solutions to the different formulations. A sample problem is
   solved using all four formulations. The results indicate that the
   explicit incorporation of uncertainty does make a difference in the
   solutions obtained. The work indicates that stochastic programming with
   recourse is a useful tool in management under uncertainty, and that it
   can be used with reasonable computational resources for problems of
   moderate size.}},

Abstract = {{A multidimensional stochastic model is developed for the space-time
   distribution of daily precipitation. The rainfall is linked to the
   atmospheric circulation patterns using conditional distributions and
   conditional spatial covariance functions. The model is a transformed
   conditional multivariate autoregressive AR(1) model, with parameters
   depending on the atmospheric circulation pattern. The model reproduces
   both the local rainfall occurrence probabilities and the distribution of
   the rainfall amounts at given locations, and the spatial dependence
   described with the help of cross-covariances of the transformed series.
   Parameter estimation methods based on the moments of the observed data
   are developed. A simulation procedure for the model is also presented.
   Its link to atmospheric circulation patterns makes it suitable for local
   precipitation simulation under stationary and nonstationary arrivals of
   atmospheric circulation patterns such as climate change. The model is
   applied using the classification scheme of the German Weather Service
   which is available for the time period 1881-1990. Precipitation data
   measured at 44 different stations for the time period 1977-1990 in the
   catchment of the river Ruhr (Germany) are used to demonstrate the model.}},

Abstract = {{A method for coupling sorption kinetics and solute advection in
   particle-tracking models is proposed; this method is efficient for the
   case where sorption rate coefficients can be assumed constant field
   scale parameters. A simulation example of reactive solute advection in
   two-dimensional heterogeneous porous media is presented. The effect of
   sorption kinetics on solute advection is investigated. Nonequilibrium
   effects are exhibited as enhanced tailing in the solute breakthrough.
   Because high variability in the hydraulic conductivity also yields
   enhanced tailing, the nonequilibrium effect is more pronounced for the
   case of low variability. Moreover, it may be difficult to distinguish
   cases of low variability with nonequilibrium sorption from cases of high
   variability with equilibrium sorption. A comparison of Monte Carlo
   ensemble results is made with an analytical model for the mass arrival
   of kinetically sorbing solute in heterogeneous porous media obtained
   using first-order perturbation. The comparison indicates that the
   analytical model provides reasonable approximations of the expected
   solute breakthrough if the variance of the natural logarithm of the
   hydraulic conductivity is smaller than 1.}},

   primarily composed of CaCO3 (11-57\%), quartz (7-39\%) and clays
   (8-43\%). Most of the particles were within the 140-3000 nm size range
   with size modes varying from 310 to 660 nm. The large amounts of
   suspended particles are considered to be related to high inputs of
   dissolved organic carbon into groundwater from sewage effluents which
   have been used for agricultural irrigation since the early 1960s. As a
   result of organic matter biodegradation in the saturated zone, anoxic
   conditions developed and the pCO2 content of groundwater increased
   dramatically (pCO2 = 10(-1.8) to 10(-1.3) atm). It is postulated that
   part of the carbonate cement of the rocks dissolved and detrital CaCO3,
   quartz and clay were released as colloidal particles. Part of the clay
   particles could have also been transported through the unsaturated zone
   into groundwater after mobilization from surface layers as a result of
   the intermittent input of water of different chemical quality. In the
   prevailing anoxic conditions of groundwater at the study site (dissolved
   oxygen concentrations of < 1 mg/L) colloidal stability is enhanced by
   organic matter coating of particles.}},

Abstract = {{Based on existing principles of automated drainage network extraction we
   have developed two methodological algorithms, the ``profile scan{''} and
   ``hydrological flow modeling,{''} and used them to extract networks from
   digital elevation models (DEMs). The ``hydrological flow modeling{''}
   algorithm specializes in the extraction of well-connected hierarchically
   arranged skeletal channel networks. On the other hand, the channels
   extracted by the ``profile scan{''} algorithm lack adequate
   connectivity, but this algorithm is suitable for the extraction of wide
   valley bottoms and other flat areas. A combination of the two algorithms
   gives a more versatile algorithm capable of yielding networks which are
   not only well connected but also portray the surface character of the
   drainage network thus generated. The good functioning of our algorithm
   is not inhibited by the presence of pits in the DEM. There is therefore
   no preprocessing of the DEM prior to drainage extraction. Rather, at the
   end of extraction, isolated spots are eliminated since these are the
   ones most probably representing artifacts.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical heterogeneity is incorporated in a stochastic transport model,
   in which the soil is viewed as consisting of an ensemble of essentially
   vertical, independent stream tubes. The saturated hydraulic conductivity
   in each stream tube is defined as the vertical average of the
   corresponding point random process. The statistics of the vertically
   averaged hydraulic conductivity and the resulting statistics of solute
   travel time are depth dependent. The evolution of the field scale
   breakthrough curve with depth is analyzed in terms of the first two
   moments of solute travel time to an arbitrary depth below the soil
   surface. The arrival time of the solute center of mass, quantified by
   the expected travel time, grows linearly with depth also for vertically
   heterogeneous soil. The temporal solute spreading around its center,
   quantified by the travel time variance, may exhibit a
   compression-expansion that is qualitatively analogous to the solute
   plume behavior in the studies of Butters and Jury (1989), Russo (1991),
   and Ellsworth and Jury (1991). The relative solute spreading, quantified
   by the travel time coefficient of variation, decreases with increasing
   depth.}},

Abstract = {{A pollution offset system is a discharge permit system in which
   transfers are made subject to a restriction that no violations of water
   quality standards occur at any location. Simulation of a pollution
   offset system with seasonal variation and multiple pollutants allows for
   comparison of the savings possible from these design features. A
   simulation model (Qual-TX) developed by the Texas Water Commission is
   applied to a case study region near Austin. Texas, yielding impact
   coefficients for an economic optimization model without investment whose
   least cost solution represents the theoretical equilibrium of a
   pollution offset system. The optimization model finds short-run savings
   of 17.5\% for a pollution offset system, as compared to a command and
   control policy that would also achieve the dissolved oxygen standard.
   Seasonal variation in permit design produces minimal effects; virtually
   all savings come from allowing pollution offsets for the two different
   pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{Disc infiltrometers are popular devices for determining in situ
   hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils. This paper compares
   alternative solutions of Richards' equation for both steady state and
   time-dependent cases. The steady state solutions were in general
   agreement using alternative hydraulic conductivity functions of the same
   capillary length scale. Small-time solutions for the nonlinear cases
   were consistent with linear diffusion from a disc source using an
   average diffusivity value which is simply related to the capillary
   length. This offers a refinement over the one-dimensional solution for
   short times in that the geometric effect of the circular source is
   included. Simulations for two examples indicate that the approach to the
   steady state solution may take considerably longer than what is commonly
   reported in the literature for field applications.}},

Abstract = {{A model is presented for the evolution of frazil over depth and with
   time in a turbulent flow. The net upward migration due to buoyancy of
   the frazil is opposed by intermittent mixing induced by large
   energy-containing eddies. A surface renewal model is used to describe
   the effects of large eddy mixing. Parameters that represent an entire
   water body are obtained by averaging those of discrete water columns
   using a probability density function. These parameters include the
   concentration profile, the surface age, and the surface layer thickness.
   A dimensionless surface renewal frequency characterizes the frazil
   distribution at equilibrium. The rate of heat loss from the water
   surface, the surface renewal frequency, and the critical surface layer
   thickness determine whether the frazil will evolve toward a well-mixed
   equilibrium state or a layered state. The model provides a physical
   basis for understanding the transition between these states. consistent
   with existing empirical criteria and field data.}},

Abstract = {{Portable dielectric probe (PDP) and time domain reflectometry (TDR)
   instruments are increasingly being used for rapid in situ determination
   of soil moisture contents. These techniques provide alternatives for
   acquiring soil moisture data in field experiments where the logistics of
   gravimetric sampling can restrict the number of samples obtained. The
   real part of the dielectric constant of soils, measured by P, L, C, and
   X band PDPs, was empirically related to soil water content for soils
   with a wide range of textures. The results were compared to TDR
   measurements as well. The P and L band probes and the TDR produced very
   comparable and accurate results, while the C and X band probes showed
   sensitivity to variability within a soil, the measurement technique, and
   soil texture. Both TDR and PDP instruments may be useful for field
   measurement campaigns, as they sample different depths and volumes. In
   general the TDR is suitable for 0-5 cm or deeper layers while the PDP
   can be used for measuring layers of the order of 1 cm in thickness.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of snow fencing a big sagebrush rangeland watershed were
   evaluated within a paired watershed study framework. The fence, 3.8 m
   tall and 800 m long, increased snow water storage 78\% and snowmelt
   runoff 129\%. Flow duration was lengthened 33 days. An average of 39\%
   of channel snow appeared as streamflow while 54\% of additional snow
   deposited by the snow fence appeared as streamflow. The proportion of
   the snowpack appearing as streamflow was directly related to the size of
   the snowpack. Placement of the fence 38 m upwind of an incised channel
   that was the primary source of streamflow maximized the water yield
   increase. The concentration of filtrable sediment and bed load transport
   were unaffected by treatment. Discharge of filtrable sediment increased
   in proportion to the increase in water yield. Filtrable sediment content
   averaged 6 mg L-1, and about 25\% of sediment weight was contributed by
   organic matter. Sediment transport after fencing averaged 0.275 x 10(3)

Abstract = {{Groundwater flow in unsaturated, fractured rock is often assumed to be
   dominated by the porous matrix component. This is frequently the result
   of reasoning that water flowing in the fractures is rapidly imbibed into
   the rock matrix by capillary suction forces with negligible resistance
   to uptake at the fracture/matrix interface. However, the existence of a
   low-permeability mineralized layer or coating at this interface may
   substantially reduce matrix imbibition and could consequently result in
   fracture-dominated flow. To test this idea, four tuff samples containing
   natural fractures were obtained from tuff formations in southern Nevada.
   By performing imbibition experiments into the matrix rock, across a
   mineralized fracture face and then across a fresh uncoated fracture
   face, water uptake as a function of time and coating was measured. A
   model combining Darcy's law and the Washburn equation has been used to
   describe the imbibition behavior. Before testing the tuff samples, the
   experimental technique and imbibition model were first tested using
   ordered sphere packings with known pore size and structure. From the
   tuff imbibition data, the ratio of the permeability through the
   mineralized face to the permeability through the uncoated face was found
   to be 0.3 (relatively little effect of the mineralized layer) for two
   samples, 0.01 for one sample, and 10(-7) (uptake strongly restricted by
   the mineralized layer) for one sample. Using a simple fracture flow
   model and the imbibition model mentioned above to simulate matrix uptake
   from the fracture, numerical simulations indicate that the existence of
   fracture coatings could significantly decrease the travel time and
   increase the travel depth of water flowing through fractures.}},

Abstract = {{It is common to represent solute transport in heterogeneous formations
   in terms of the resident concentration C(x, t), regarded as a random
   space function. The present study investigates the alternative
   representation by q, the solute mass flux at a point of a control plane
   normal to the mean flow. This representation is appropriate for many
   field applications in which the variable of interest is the mass of
   solute discharged through a control surface. A general framework to
   compute the statistical moments of q and of the associated total solute
   discharge Q and mass M is established. With x the direction of the mean
   flow, a solute particle is crossing the control plane at y = eta, z =
   zeta and at the travel (arrival) time-tau. The associated expected
   solute flux value is proportional to the joint probability density
   function (pdf) g1 of eta, zeta, and tau, whereas the variance of q is
   shown to depend on the joint pdf g2 of the same variables for two
   particles. In turn, the statistical moments of eta, zeta, and tau-depend
   on those of the velocity components through a system of stochastic
   ordinary differential equations. For a steady velocity field and
   neglecting the effect of pore-scale dispersion, a major simplification
   of the problem results in the independence of the random variables-eta,
   zeta, and tau. As a consequence, the pdf of eta and zeta can be derived
   independently of tau. A few approximate approaches to derive the
   statistical moments of eta, zeta, and tau are outlined. These methods
   will be explored in paper 2 in order to effectively derive the variances
   of the total solute discharge and mass, while paper 3 will deal with the
   nonlinear effect of the velocity variance upon the moments of eta, zeta,
   and tau.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty in the mass flux for advection dominated solute movement in
   heterogeneous porous media is investigated using the Lagrangian
   framework developed in paper 1 by Dagan et al. (this issue). Expressions
   for the covariance of the mass flux and cumulative mass flux are derived
   as functions of the injection volume and sampling area size relative to
   the scale of heterogeneity. The result is illustrated for solute
   advection in three types of heterogeneous porous media: stratified
   formations, two- and three-dimensional porous media; small perturbation
   approximation is used for the two- and three-dimensional cases.
   Variances of the mass flux and cumulative mass flux are evaluated as
   functions of the injection volume (area) scale versus log-hydraulic
   conductivity integral scale. The greatest decrease in coefficient of
   variation (CV) of the mass flux is for the source scale 1-5 times the
   hydraulic conductivity integral scale; further increase in the source
   size decreases CV comparatively less. The variance of the cumulative
   mass flux (or total discharge) indicates that for the source size of 20
   hydraulic conductivity integral scales, the transport conditions are
   almost ergodic. The present results also indicate that the cumulative
   mass flux is a relatively robust quantity for describing field-scale
   solute transport.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of transport of contaminants in a layered aquifer system still
   poses significant challenges, although considerable progress has been
   made in the literature toward the understanding of this problem. In this
   study, an analytical approach is chosen as the mode of analysis, and a
   closed form solution is developed for a quasi-three-dimensional
   advective-diffusion equation defined for a layered aquifer. The layered
   aquifer is idealized as an aquifer-aquitard system in which the solution
   domain is considered to be finite and two dimensional in the aquifer
   region and infinite and one dimensional in the adjacent aquitards. The
   analytical solution outlined emphasizes the advection of contaminant in
   the longitudinal direction in the aquifer and also in the transverse
   vertical direction in the aquifer-aquitard system. The analytical
   solution also includes the two-dimensional diffusion of the contaminant
   in the aquifer, one-dimensional diffusion in the aquitards, and
   first-order reaction and retardation terms in both aquifer and
   aquitards.}},

Abstract = {{In a companion paper, analytical solutions describing the fate of a
   solute in a layered aquifer system are given. In the study presented
   here, these closed form solutions are utilized in solution of several
   problems of relevance to layered aquifer analysis. Initially, the
   example problems discussed here are primarily chosen for the purpose of
   verification of some of these analytical solutions. These applications
   are later extended to other aquifer-aquitard configurations, to
   demonstrate the range of problems that may be analyzed using these
   procedures. Thus, in this sense, the problems discussed here cover only
   a sample of cases which may be studied utilizing the solutions developed
   earlier. In the examples discussed here, the importance of advective
   transport in the vertical direction is emphasized for contaminant
   transport analysis in a layered system.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the stable isotope composition (delta-H-2 and
   delta-O-18) of water vapor and associated micrometeorological parameters
   were made before and after full establishment of a rice crop in
   southeastern Australia. The aim of the experiment was to gain a better
   understanding of stable isotope variations of water vapor near the
   ground surface in response to local evaporation, local transpiration,
   regional scale vapor transport and the vertical stability of the
   atmospheric boundary layer. Vapor samples were collected at several
   heights within 9 m of the water surface during two separate sampling
   periods. The delta-H-2 values of the water vapor ranged over more than
   60 parts-per-thousand, reflecting major rapid changes in regional air
   mass sources, as well as variations in the stability of the lowest 10 m
   of the atmosphere. The influence of tropical and higher-latitude air
   masses resulted in local vapor compositions which were relatively
   enriched and depleted, respectively, in heavy isotopes. Vertical
   gradients in heavy isotope abundances were very large during stable
   conditions (as much as DELTA-delta-H-2 = -27 parts per thousand from 0.8
   to 8.4 m), as the result of mixing between transpired water and regional
   air vapor. Transpiration fluxes calculated from the water vapor
   delta-H-2 gradient ranged from 5 to 7 mm d-1, which was in good
   agreement with one-dimensional aerodynamic energy budget calculations of
   daytime vapor fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{Cross borehole electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was used to image
   the resistivity distribution before and during two infiltration
   experiments. In both cases water was introduced into the vadose zone,
   and the change in resistivity associated with the plume of wetted soil
   was imaged as a function of time. The primary purpose of this work was
   to study the capabilities and limitations of ERT to image underground
   structure and groundwater movement in the vadose zone. A secondary goal
   was to learn specifics of unsaturated flow in a complex geologic
   setting. Tomographs of electrical resistivity taken before infiltration
   image coarser, well-drained soils (sands and gravels) as more resistive
   zones, whereas finer grained soils (silts and clays), which hold more
   water by capillarity, are imaged as more conductive. Images of changes
   in resistivity during infiltration show growth of the water infiltration
   plume with time that is consistent with known geology. In the ERT images
   we see the effects of capillary barriers and infer differences between
   capillary-driven flow through fine sediments and gravity-driven flow
   through very permeable sediments. Images are consistent with numerical
   flow simulations using hydrological parameter values consistent with
   soil types inferred from well logs. ERT can be a useful tool to monitor
   movement of circuitous moisture fronts in a heterogeneous field setting
   that would go undetected by borehole measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We illustrate the result that lumping together some of the states of a

   first-order Markov chain with a smaller number of states. If a series
   generated in this way is nevertheless assumed to have been produced by a
   two-state Markov chain, standard statistical procedures (using the
   Akaike and Bayesian information criteria) may indicate that it should be
   fitted by a higher order than first. Stochastic models based on a Markov
   chain are often used to model precipitation series. It is normal to
   classify days as ``dry{''} and ``wet{''} and fit a two-state process. In
   some cases, second- or higher-order chains are preferred by reference to
   information criteria. In the light of the foregoing, we suggest that
   this might be because a many-state process, possibly of only first
   order, would actually be a better choice than a two-state process.}},

Abstract = {{In the literature during the past several years there appear numerous
   references to the ``equivalent aperture{''} of a rough-walled rock
   fracture as derived from various hydraulic and tracer tests. However,
   the similar or even identical terms used by different researchers for
   ``equivalent aperture{''} often do not have the same meaning. This has
   led to some confusion in the comparison of their results. In particular,
   there is a serious apparent contradiction in the claims of some authors
   that ``equivalent apertures{''} derived from tracer tests are much
   larger than those derived from hydraulic tests, and the findings of
   others that apertures estimated from tracer tests are consistently
   smaller than those estimated from hydraulic tests. This apparent
   contradiction of the field results in fact arises from the different
   definitions of the so-called ``tracer aperture{''} as employed by
   different researchers. In this short technical note I have attempted to
   sort out the different definitions, denotations and usage of the various
   ``equivalent apertures{''} and show that there are mainly three
   alternative definitions used in the literature. The meaning of each as
   related to experimental measurements is explained and their
   interrelationship discussed. It is shown that once the specific
   definition of ``equivalent aperture{''} referred to by each researcher
   is identified, then the relative magnitudes of these ``equivalent
   apertures{''} as reported by different groups of researchers are
   perfectly consistent with each other.}},

Abstract = {{A local mission of short duration was carried out to investigate the
   relationship between signals acquired by an airborne multispectral
   camera (MSC-02) developed by XYbion Corporation and in situ water
   sampling. The MSC-02 was used to produce video images in six spectral
   bands in the reflective and near-infrared region of the spectrum from
   which all below-surface hydrological signals originate. Images of
   halon-coated panels were obtained in all bands to calculate relative
   radiometric calibration functions. These functions were applied to
   corresponding spectral images to calculate relative radiances of both
   panel and estuarine water targets. These values were then input to
   regression equations to establish a correlation between water
   constituents (organic/inorganic) and MSC-02 signals indicating the
   degree of eutrophication in the estuary. It is hypothesized that if
   reliable relationships between MSC-02 data with fine spatial resolution
   and selected water quality parameters are obtained, then it would be
   possible to calibrate the concurrently acquired Landsat 5 thematic
   mapper (TM) data with coarser spatial resolution for monitoring of
   estuarine water quality.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for the characterization of the head and velocity fields for

   covariances as well as the velocity-head, velocity-log conductivity and
   head-log conductivity cross covariances. All these functions are given
   in terms of the parameters which characterize the input log conductivity
   field and the average head gradient. A general procedure is outlined,
   followed by explicit derivation of head and velocity covariances for
   heterogeneous, statistically anisotropic formations. Closed form
   analytic results are obtained for the statistically isotropic
   formations, while the results for the anisotropic ones required taking
   quadrature over analytic expressions. The results may be used for
   transport predictions and for conditioning on measurements, and may be
   particularly useful for testing of numerical codes.}},

Title = {{ACCURACY OF OPERATOR SPLITTING FOR ADVECTION-DISPERSION-REACTION
   PROBLEMS}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1471-1476}},

Abstract = {{An operator-splitting approach is often used for the numerical solution
   of advection-dispersion-reaction problems. Operationally, this approach
   advances the solution over a single time step in two stages, one
   involving the solution of the nonreactive advection-dispersion equation
   and the other the solution of the reaction equations. The first stage is
   usually solved with a finite difference, finite element, or related
   technique, while the second stage is normally solved with an ordinary
   differential equation integrator. The only generally published
   guidelines on numerical accuracy suggest that the discretization errors
   associated with each stage must be small in order to achieve high
   accuracy of the overall solution. However, in this note we demonstrate
   that there is an inherent mass balance error present in the
   operator-splitting algorithm for problems involving continuous mass
   influx boundary conditions. The mass balance error does not exist for
   instantaneous mass input problems. These conclusions are based upon
   analysis of a simple first-order decay problem for which each stage of
   the calculation can be performed analytically (i.e., without
   discretization error). For this linear decay problem we find that the
   product of the first-order decay coefficient (k) times DELTA-t must be
   less than approximately 0.1 in order for the mass balance error to be
   less than 5\%. We also present a variant of the normal
   operator-splitting algorithm in which the order of solving the
   advection-dispersion and reaction operators is reversed at each time
   step. This modification reduces the mass balance error by more than a
   factor of 10 for a wide range of k-DELTA-t values.}},

Abstract = {{Voting behavior in a flood control referendum in Roanoke, Virginia,
   provides evidence that people living and working outside the flood prone
   area are willing to pay for flood control project construction.  This
   voting behavior supports the argument that flood control benefits exist
   at the community level.  In providing the cost sharing required under
   recent federal legislation, local government financing which distributes
   project costs over the whole population of a local jurisdiction, and not
   just those persons living or working in protected areas, may increase
   both economic efficiency and expand communities' financial capacity to

Abstract = {{Riparian resources include the borders of rivers, lakes, ponds, and
   potholes.  These border areas are very important for a number of
   reasons, including stream channel maintenance, flood control,
   aesthetics, erosion control, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and
   water quality maintenance.  These diverse functions are not well
   protected by law or policy.  We reviewed law and policies regarding
   endangered species habitat designation, land use planning, grazing
   management, water allocation, takings, and federal permits and licenses,
   along with the roles of federal, state, and local governments.  We
   discuss the politics of implementing these policies, focusing on the
   difficulties in changing entrenched water and land use practices.  Our
   review indicates a lack of direct attention to riparian ecosystem issues
   in almost all environmental and land use programs at every level of
   government.  Protection of riparian resource values requires a means to
   integrate existing programs to focus on riparian zones.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies have been carried out regarding the development of optimum
   operating policies for multiple reservoir systems but few of these have
   considered water quality as an objective.  This study considers
   operations of the headworks system for Adelaide, Australia.  The system
   is rather unusual because of its high salt concentrations which impose
   large economic costs on the consumers.  In addition, a significant
   fraction of the supply is pumped from a distant river.  An existing
   linear programming model for operation of the Adelaide system is
   modified to identify policies which minimize total system costs
   (including salt damage costs).  These changed procedures can reduce the
   average salinity of the supplied water significantly but at some
   increase in annual pumping costs.  The benefit-cost ratio of the changes
   is estimated to be 3.0 for the entire system.}},

Abstract = {{In optimization of any hydro plant system, the analysis should make use
   of all information available, including a thorough study of streamflow
   and civil engineering and electromechanical cost effectiveness.  For
   this purpose a general mathematical model is used for an overall design
   optimization of run-of-river power plants.  The design criteria for such
   power plants are fundamentally based on some important and critical
   cost-effective parameters such as discharge design, penstock or tunnel
   diameter, turbine capacity, number of units and type of turbines.  The
   optimization process consists of three main steps:  (1) find the maximum
   yearly energy; (2) maximize the yearly benefits of all the maximized
   sets of power plants; and (3) select the most beneficial of the feasible
   sets of run-of-river power plants on the basis of a combination of the
   cited criteria.  The computational analysis is based upon two major
   objective functions and a computer program which is developed for fast
   maximization and optimization of the generated equations.}},

Abstract = {{The successful application of a conceptual rainfall-runoff (CRR) model
   depends on how well it is calibrated. Despite the popularity of CRR
   models, reports in the literature indicate that it is typically
   difficult, if not impossible, to obtain unique optimal values for their
   parameters using automatic calibration methods. Unless the best set of
   parameters associated with a given calibration data set can be found, it
   is difficult to determine how sensitive the parameter estimates (and
   hence the model forecasts) are to factors such as input and output data
   error, model error, quantity and quality of data, objective function
   used, and so on. Results are presented that establish clearly the nature
   of the multiple optima problem for the research CRR model SIXPAR. These
   results suggest that the CRR model optimization problem is more
   difficult than had been previously thought and that currently used local
   search procedures have a very low probability of successfully finding
   the optimal parameter sets. Next, the performance of three existing
   global search procedures are evaluated on the model SIXPAR. Finally, a
   powerful new global optimization procedure is presented, entitled the
   shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) method, which was able to
   consistently locate the global optimum of the SIXPAR model, and appears
   to be capable of efficiently and effectively solving the CRR model
   optimization problem.}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport through heterogeneous formations is modeled by the
   travel time approach, i.e., the time tau it takes a solute particle to
   travel from the source to a control plane.  Due to uncertainty tau is a
   random variable characterized by its cumulative probability density
   function G(tau).  This function is used by regulatory agencies in
   pollution site assessment.  The main aim of the present study is to
   examine the impact of data, namely measured transmissivities, upon
   G(tau) and reduction of uncertainty.  This is achieved for
   two-dimensional steady flow of average uniform head gradient by using a
   Lagrangian approach developed in the past (Dagan, 1982, 1984, 1989;
   Rubin, 1990, 1991).  The impact of data is seen in conditioning on
   measured values and in estimation of parameters characterizing flow and
   formation properties.  The approach is illustrated by a simulation based
   on synthetic data.  The results show how uncertainty is reduced by
   increasing the density of measurements for a control plane sufficiently
   far from the source.}},

Abstract = {{Time-dependent quasi-linearized infiltration with constant diffusivity
   from an axisymmetric shallow flat pond into a homogeneous semi-infinite
   porous medium is investigated.  Use of the Laplace transform reduces the
   equation to a form that can be solved using the boundary element method
   and inverted without difficulty.  Previous attacks on this problem have
   been limited to solutions for large time because of the lack of a closed
   form expression for the axisymmetric free space Green's function.  Here
   an alternative technique for evaluating the axisymmetric free space
   Green's function is presented, which enables solutions to be obtained at
   any time.  Time-varying fluxes are presented for a range of cavity
   sizes.  The numerical results for small time match those predicted from
   one-dimensional infiltration models, while the large time results
   approach the appropriate steady state values.  The detailed numerical
   results indicate that approximate analytic results for fluxes from
   buried sources can be extended to include the shallow flat pond.  This,
   together with earlier approximations for steady state fluxes, allows the
   flux from a shallow flat pond to be simply estimated at any time.}},

Abstract = {{A zero-dimensional (lumped), linear conceptual model of the subsurface
   storm flow from hillslopes has been developed by integrating, over the
   length of the hillslope, the linearized one-dimensional
   (Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation) discharge relationship for saturated
   flow over an inclined plane.  The derived two-term storage function
   accounts for gravity- and gradient-driven flow.  Coupled with the
   storage balance equation for the plane, the model allows direct,
   analytical computation of the outflow hydrograph at the foot of the hill
   in response to an infiltration step input.  The model is the conceptual
   counterpart of the linear advection-diffusion (LAD) flow equation
   derived from the extended Boussinesq equation through linearization.  In
   contrast to the kinematic wave approximation, the outflows normalized by
   their equilibrium values are properly given as functions of the
   infiltration rate.  The outflow hydrographs computed by the conceptual
   LAD model approximate nonlinear behavior closely over a wide range of
   conditions encountered in field applications.}},

Abstract = {{A water distribution system often consists of a large number of
   components.  However, funds are, in general, not available to completely
   update/upgrade the deteriorating water distribution system's components.
   Limited funds have to be optimally distributed among the system's
   components on the basis of the contribution of each component to the
   overall system's availability.  The large dimension and high degree of
   nonlinearity of models of deteriorating large-scale water distribution
   networks make the maintenance-related problem difficult to handle as a
   whole.  In this paper a multilevel approach is proposed for water
   distribution systems that maximizes the availability of the overall
   system under a given cost constraint.  This decomposition method tackles
   a large-scale nonlinear programming problem by solving a set of linear
   programming problems with a smaller dimension iteratively, thus greatly
   reducing a large-scale system's complexity.}},

Abstract = {{The use of contaminant transport modeling has become an integral
   component of the regulatory and decision process for the disposal and
   cleanup of hazardous wastes.  Because many of the input parameters to
   these models are uncertain, analysis of this uncertainty and its impact
   on the decision process has become increasingly important.  Many
   contaminant transport models are computationally intensive and require
   run times that make traditional Monte Carlo analysis impractical.  This
   paper therefore evaluates and tests an approximate technique, the
   Rackwitz-Fiessler method, that can be used when computation time
   prohibits the use of Monte Carlo simulation.  The accuracy and
   efficiency of the method is assessed and compared to Monte Carlo
   simulation for three contaminant transport models.}},

Abstract = {{Major episodic acidifications were observed on several occasions in
   first-order brooks at Acadia National Park, Mount Desert Island, Maine. 
   Short-term declines of up to 2 pH units and 130-mu-eq L-1
   acid-neutralizing capacity were caused by HCl from soil solutions,
   rather than by H2SO4 or HNO3 from precipitation, because (1) SO4
   concentrations were constant or decreased during the pH depression, (2)
   Cl concentrations were greatest at the time of lowest pH, and (3) Na:Cl
   ratios decreased from values much greater than those in precipitation (a
   result of chemical weathering), to values equal to or less than those in
   precipitation.  Dilution, increases in NO3 concentrations, or increased
   export or organic acidity from soils were insufficient to cause the
   observed decreases in pH.  These data represent surface water
   acidifications due primarily to an ion exchange ``salt effect{''} of Na+
   for H+ in soil solution, and secondarily to dilution, neither of which
   is a consequence of acidic deposition.  The requisite conditions for a
   major episodic salt effect acidification include acidic soils, and
   either an especially salt-laden wet precipitation event, or a period of
   accumulation of marine salts from dry deposition, followed by wet
   inputs.}},

Abstract = {{River networks constitute dissipative systems with many spatial degrees
   of freedom. Previous work by Mandelbrot (1983) and Bak et al. (1987,
   1988, 1990) suggests that such systems will follow power law
   distributions in their mass and energy characteristics. It is shown that
   this is the case for river networks where the exponent beta in the
   distribution, P{[}X > x] proportional-to x-beta, is approximately equal
   to 0.45 and 0.90 for discharge and energy respectively in the case of
   several networks analyzed in North America when these variables are
   calculated for each individual link throughout the drainage network. An
   explanation of the values of beta is offered based on the fractal
   structure of rivers and on principles of energy expenditure in river
   basins.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions are developed for modeling steady state gas flow to
   a single vacuum extraction well in the unsaturated zone.  The solutions
   are applicable to isotropic as well as anisotropic homogeneous
   subsurface media in which the ground surface is open to the atmosphere. 
   Analytic expressions are given for the gas pressure field, and for the
   stream function distribution.  Streamline travel times are computed
   using a simple numerical technique employing the analytical solutions. 
   The pressure solution may be used to analyze in situ gas pumping tests
   to determine average horizontal and vertical gas permeabilities.  The
   stream function solution and streamline travel times may be used to
   optimize the design of vapor extraction systems for volatile organic
   chemical removal from the unsaturated zone.  Application of the
   solutions to several examples illustrates the strong effect of screen
   location and anisotropy on the induced gas flow field, and dimensionless
   type curves are given for a variety of gas well geometries.}},

Abstract = {{It was found recently that the long-slope ponded infiltration solution
   applies also to a wide range of nonplanar topographies.  The long-slope
   solution neglects any slope crest effect, and a careful analysis of this
   is needed.  The present work reassesses the previous primitive estimate
   of the crest effect.  We solve the problem of linearized infiltration
   into a symmetrical ridge with 45-degrees slope angles.  The integral
   matching of flow behavior gives results of ample accuracy for our
   purpose.  The 45-degrees slope is very steep in nature, but yields a
   simple product solution.  We use this to calibrate the previous
   long-slope criterion for arbitrary slope angle.  The primary slope crest
   effect is increase of moisture content and decrease of capillary
   potential gradients near the crest.  The affected region propagates
   downslope but its influence on infiltration dynamics tends to dissipate
   because the relative importance of capillarity diminishes as time
   increases.  We find that the previous criterion for applicability of
   long-slope infiltration dynamics was too conservative by a factor
   ranging from 2 at very small infiltration times to 100 at large times. 
   The solution gives details of both downslope and inslope unsaturated
   flows.  The ponded infiltration rate is least at the crest and increases
   downslope:  This result is independent of linearization or slope angle.}},

   Cevennes region (France) is used to infer the model.  The inner
   variability is independent of the intermittency, thereby allowing a

Abstract = {{A procedure is presented to explicitly evaluate the effect of estimation
   errors in the temporal and spatial distribution of rainfall on the
   uncertainty of calibrated rainfall-runoff model parameters.  The effect
   of this uncertainty on the reliability of design flood predictions is
   considered.  A case study of the Hacking catchment, south of Sydney,
   Australia, is presented to illustrate the procedure.  For a major storm
   event a simple stochastic transformed rainfall model is calibrated and
   validated using kriging and then used to infer the mean and covariance
   of subareal rainfall.  The RORB model, a distributed nonlinear
   rainfall-runoff model, is calibrated to this storm event.  When
   allowance is made for uncertainty in the calibration event rainfall, the
   results indicate that the uncertainty in the calibrated parameters
   increases, especially in the rainfall excess parameters, and the 90\%
   prediction interval on the 100-year design flood increases by about
   100\%.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical spectral method is described for solving the equations
   governing the effective hydraulic conductivity of a stationary
   heterogeneous porous medium.  The numerical method is efficient in the
   sense that the solution can be achieved in order N(t) In (N(t)
   operations and order N(t) storage, where N(t) is the total number of
   sampling points used in an n-dimensional flow domain.  The numerical
   method is extensively tested and shown to be quite robust.  In the test
   cases, very accurate results are achieved even for an extremely
   heterogeneous porous medium.  The developed numerical algorithm is quite
   general and can be used to compute effective conductivities for cases
   where analytic results are unavailable.  In the companion paper (Dykaar

   conductivity of (1) multidimensional isotropic, stationary, lognormally

   variances in log conductivity ranging between 1 and 6.  The results show
   that averaging volumes of at least 30 integral scales are required
   before the effective conductivity reaches its asymptotic value.  The
   results support Matheron's (1967) hypothesis that K(e) = K(G) exp
   (sigma(y) 2/6, where K(e) is the effective hydraulic conductivity, and
   K(G) and sigma(Y)2 are the geometric mean and variance, respectively, of
   the hydraulic conductivity field.  We also find that for a Gaussian
   covariance function, heterogeneities smaller than about 1.3 integral
   scale do not significantly contribute to the effective conductivity.  In
   two dimensions, averaging volumes of more than 80 integral scales are
   required before the effective conductivity reaches the analytic
   infinite-domain result of the geometric mean, while the effective
   conductivity is insensitive to heterogeneities less than 2 integral
   scales in size.  The method is also applied to data from a shale and
   sandstone formation, and the results are compared with those form other
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In previous work a solution was developed for the kinematic wave
   overland flow equation with rainfall excess given by Philip's
   infiltration equation.  Subsequent application of this solution to field
   data from small plots revealed the need for an improved model.  The
   principal requirement is the incorporation of depression storage into
   the rising limb calculation.  A second requirement is a more precise
   approximation of the water surface profile at the end of rainfall.  This
   improves the falling limb calculations.  This paper shows the solutions
   obtained by incorporating these improvements and demonstrates their
   effects on predicted hydrographs and water surface profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Water demand equations are estimated using the most current American
   Water Works Association (1984) survey of 430 (of 600 largest) U.S.
   utilities.  The data set was augmented by monthly rainfall and
   temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration's climatological data.  Demographic data were obtained
   from the U.S. Department of Commerce (1988).  Besides the usual
   endogeneity problems involving block price structures this paper also
   examines the possible endogeneity of conservation and education
   programs.  Three types of models were used:  a marginal price model, an
   average price model, and Shin's (1985) price perception model.  The
   results generally show that price elasticity is higher in the South and
   the West.  Conservation does not appear to reduce water use, but public
   education appears to have reduced water usage in the West.  The Shin
   (1985) tests in this study indicate that consumers react more to average
   than marginal prices in all regions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper points out how a system of marketable discount coupons
   applied to the sale of water by an agency can satisfy both
   redistributional and revenue constraints without compromise to economic
   efficiency, in effect creating marketable multipart pricing.  This
   procedure achieves marginal cost pricing for each user while decreasing
   the average consumer's expenditures on water.  Efficiency would obtain
   both in allocation among users and in overall usage.  No information on
   consumer demand for water is required.  A useful by-product is market
   revelation of the marginal value of incremental water usage, thereby
   also shedding light on the value of incremental water projects.}},

Abstract = {{A successive approximation linear quadratic regulator (SALQR) method
   with management periods is combined with a finite element groundwater
   flow and transport simulation model to determine optimal time-varying
   groundwater pump-and-treat reclamation policies.  Management periods are
   groups of simulation time steps during which the pumping policy remains
   constant.  In an example problem, management periods reduced the total
   computational demand, as measured by the CPU time, by as much as 85\%
   compared to the time needed for the SALQR solution without management
   periods.  Conversely, the optimal costs increased as the number of times
   that the control can change is reduced.  With two simulation periods per
   management period, the optimal cost increased by less than 1\% compared
   to the optimal cost with no management periods, yet the computational
   work was reduced by a third.  The optimal policies, including the number
   and locations of wells, changed significantly with the number of
   management periods.  Complexity analysis revealed that the SALQR
   algorithm with management periods can significantly reduce the
   computational requirements for nonsteady optimization of groundwater
   reclamation and other management applications.}},

Abstract = {{A heuristic approach based on facility location theory effectively
   augments groundwater quality monitoring configurations through the
   strategic siting of additional wells.  The approach is an alternative to
   variance-based schemes previously established for the augmentation
   problem.  The method developed herein is practical in that it (1) is
   relatively easily understood, (2) is not difficult to implement and
   solve, and (3) does not require a large number of preexisting
   observation points.  The approach has been applied to a case study
   involving a landfill-contaminated buried valley aquifer in southwest
   Ohio.  Configurations derived by the heuristic approach exhibit two key
   characteristics:  (1) location of wells near areas of high estimated
   contaminant concentration and (2) interwell separation distances that
   facilitate areal plume coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Benefit transfer has been an ongoing, practical analysis for years in
   legal proceedings and government policy analyses where timely benefit
   estimates are critically dependent on the use of existing data.  Most
   benefit transfer studies to date have been conducted behind closed doors
   and have not been open to scholarly review, and no systematic research
   agenda has been established to determine whether benefit transfer
   estimates are valid for public policy analyses.  In this paper we

Abstract = {{This study quantifies local improvements in environmental quality from
   controlling effluents in the pulp and paper industry.  Although it is
   confined to a single industry, this study is the first effort to assess
   the actual net benefits of the Clean Water Act pollution control
   program.  An assessment of water quality benefits requires linking
   regulatory policy, technical effects, and behavioral responses. 
   Regulatory policies mandate specific controls that influence the
   quantity and nature of effluent discharges.  We identify a subset of
   stream segments suitable for analysis, describe water quality
   simulations and control cost calculations under alternative regulatory
   scenarios, assign feasible water uses to each segment based on water
   quality, and determine probable upper bounds for the willingness of
   beneficiaries to pay.  Because the act imposes uniform regulations that
   do not account for differences in compliance costs, existing stream
   quality, contributions of other effluent sources, and recreation
   potential, the relation between water quality benefits and costs varies
   widely across sites.  This variation suggests that significant positive
   net benefits have probably been achieved in some cases, but we conclude
   that the costs of the Clean Water Act as a whole exceed likely benefits
   by a significant margin.}},

Abstract = {{Benefit transfer is the process by which researchers take recreational
   demand models or other models which are estimated for one site or region
   and apply them to another site or region.  Model estimation is
   frequently viewed as a simple exercise in classical statistics.  Here it
   is argued that, while standard hypothesis testing plays a role in model
   estimation, it may be less important than the researcher's judgment
   about how the model ought to work.  The power of economics lies
   principally with the logic of theory, and then with the strength of
   empirical evidence.  These arguments are illustrated using the travel
   cost approach to estimating the demand for recreation.  There are
   several major research issues (for example, the role of substitute
   prices) which influence the final estimates of benefits but which must
   be determined at least in part by the researcher.  The implication for
   benefit transfer is that this is also within the realm of judgment for
   the researcher, but that it will be more acceptable when judgment is
   recognized.  That is, the original benefit estimates are tailored for a
   specific application.  They cannot be treated as if they came from a
   strictly random process.  Recognizing this tailoring process will put
   the researcher in a better position for transferring model results.}},

Abstract = {{The desire for economic values of recreation for unstudied recreation
   resources dates back to the water resource development benefit-cost
   analyses of the early 1960s.  Rather than simply applying existing
   estimates of benefits per trip to the study site, a fairly rigorous
   approach was developed by a number of economists.  This approach
   involves application of travel cost demand equations and contingent
   valuation benefit functions from existing sites to the new site.  In
   this way the spatial market of the new site (i.e., its differing own
   price, substitute prices and population distribution) is accounted for
   in the new estimate of total recreation benefits.  The assumptions of
   benefit transfer from recreation sites in one state to another state for
   the same recreation activity is empirically tested.  The equality of
   demand coefficients for ocean sport salmon fishing in Oregon versus
   Washington and for freshwater steelhead fishing in Oregon versus Idaho
   is rejected.  Thus transfer of either demand equations or average
   benefits per trip are likely to be in error.  Using the Oregon steelhead
   equation, benefit transfers to rivers within the state are shown to be
   accurate to within 5-15\%.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of studies on outdoor recreation demand creates an
   opportunity to apply the growing science of reviewing research for
   purposes of benefit transfer.  The process involves developing an
   understanding of the variables that explain the observed difference in
   estimates.  This paper illustrates how the results of previous studies
   could be adjusted to develop some tentative estimates of nonmarket
   values for future policy analysis.  Also, the evaluation of some
   potentially important variables should help improve statistical analysis
   and the allocation of resources to new studies.  The challenge is to
   build each subsequent work on the knowledge gained from previous ones. 
   In this experimental phase, there is a need to examine additional
   variables that might conceivably be more important than those considered
   in the past.}},

Abstract = {{We offer an economic model of the policymaker's site- or time-specific
   benefit estimate extrapolation problem when she must weigh the potential
   gains from an increase in the accuracy and the precision of her agents'
   estimates against the costs of conducting their assessments.  If
   Bayesian exchangeability is treated as a maintained hypothesis, we
   suggest that empirical Bayes estimators offer a powerful way to increase
   the economic efficiency of extrapolation.  Finally, we employ a hedonic
   study of pollution control benefits to illustrate a Bayesian diagnostic
   that allows the hypothesis of exchangeability to be tested rather than
   taken as maintained.  The power of the diagnostic arises from its
   ability to identify those sources of parameter variability most likely
   to discourage extrapolations.}},

Abstract = {{Microorganisms present in deep Atlantic coastal plain sediments affect
   the geochemical evolution of groundwater and its chemical and isotopic
   composition, yet the factors controlling their origin, distribution, and
   diversity are poorly understood. The evolution of the groundwater
   chemistry, the fractionation of stable carbon isotopes, and the
   groundwater age are all indicators of the inorganic and microbial
   reactions occurring along a given flow path from groundwater recharge to
   groundwater discharge. In this study, tritium, C-14, and groundwater
   chemistry along three flow paths of the Middendorf aquifer in South
   Carolina were analyzed. The C-14 ranged from 89 percent modern carbon
   (pmC) in the recharge zone to 9.9 pmC in the distal borehole; the
   delta-C-13 remained relatively constant at approximately -22
   parts-per-thousand, suggesting microbial oxidation of organic carbon.
   Carbon isotope analyses of particulate organic carbon from core
   sediments and groundwater chemistry were used to model the carbon
   chemistry; the groundwater ages obtained from C-14 ranged from modern to
   11,500 years B.P. The highest frequencies of occurrence, numbers, and
   diversity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were found in boreholes near
   the recharge zone where the calculated ages were < 1000 years B.P. The
   transport of microorganisms from the recharge zone may be responsible
   for this distribution as well as the electron acceptors necessary to
   support this diverse community of bacteria. The presence of both aerobic
   heterotrophs and anaerobic sulfate- and iron-reducing bacteria in the
   core sediments suggested the occurrence of anaerobic microsites
   throughout this otherwise aerobic aquifer. The highest in situ microbial
   respiration rate, as determined by modeling, was found along a flow path
   near the recharge area. It is likely that the electron acceptors
   necessary for supporting a diverse microbial community are depleted by
   the time the groundwater residence time in the Middendorf aquifer
   exceeds several hundred years.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical profiles of H-3 and He isotope ratios have been measured in
   groundwater from the well-characterized Borden aquifer, Ontario.  The
   sum of H-3 and tritiogenic He-3 (He-3{*}) is used as an equivalent
   nondecaying tracer, while the ratio of He-3{*} to H-3 is used to compute
   groundwater ages.  The mid-1960s H-3 peak is not always apparent using
   the H-3 data because both dispersion and radioactive decay have
   significantly reduced the magnitude of the H-3 bomb peak.  However, the
   sum of H-3 and He-3{*} clearly defines the bomb peak at several
   locations.  The accuracy of the H-3/He-3 dating method depends on the
   ability of the saturated zone to retain He-3{*} against diffusive loss
   at the water table and on the amount of dispersive mixing that occurs
   within the saturated zone of shallow unconfined aquifers.  Helium 3
   confinement is strong while dispersive mixing is weak in the Borden
   aquifer, resulting in an excellent delineation of groundwater travel
   times.  Computed H-3/He-3 age profiles are compared with travel times
   predicted using a previously calibrated flow model.  Although the
   H-3/He-3 age profiles are vertically offset from the modeled travel
   times, the travel time and H-3/He-3 age gradients compare exceptionally
   well.  Recharge rates have been computed using the H-3/He-3 age
   gradients and vary from 62 cm yr-1 beneath the Borden landfill to 14 cm
   yr-1 north of the landfill.  The H-3/He-3-computed recharge agrees well
   with the recharge function used in previous flow modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Steady state nonuniform flow in a heterogeneous medium is investigated
   using a combined numerical-empirical approach.  The objective of the
   study is to determine the effective transmissivity of a square field
   with a constant-head external boundary and a constant-rate well at its
   center.  Transmissivity at the point scale is modeled as an isotropic
   and multivariate lognormal spatial random function.  Block
   transmissivities are defined using an empirical scaling up of point
   support values within the field.  The scaling process is a weighted
   spatial geometric averaging where log transmissivities are weighted by
   the inverse square of their distance from the well.  Block
   transmissivities thus obtained and true effective values calculated
   using a numerical flow model are compared for realizations a finely
   discretized transmissivity field.  The principal finding of this study
   is that effective transmissivities obtained from the numerical flow
   model and block values obtained by spatial averaging are in excellent
   agreement for low to moderate variances of log transmissivity and
   moderately eccentric field geometries.  The geostatistical model for
   point scale transmissivity and the deterministic spatial averaging law
   are combined in order to create a geostatistical model for
   transmissivity at the block scale.  Exact expressions are derived for
   the ensemble moments of block-averaged transmissivities and well
   drawdowns in both the nonconditional case and the conditional case when
   transmissivity at the well bore is known.  The ensemble mean of
   block-averaged transmissivity is found to decrease from the ensemble
   arithmetic mean toward the ensemble geometric mean as the field size
   becomes large compared to the integral range of spatial correlation. 
   This result contradicts earlier published work.  Numerical results
   presented in this study also disagree with the analytical results of a
   recent stochastic analysis of specific discharge in radial systems.}},

   automate the analysis of TDR traces to determine theta(v) was developed

Abstract = {{Temporal variations in barometric pressure due to weather patterns may
   induce air intrusion into the subsurface.  This air intrusion can affect
   monitoring activities aimed at characterizing the composition and
   movement of gases in the vadose zone.  Expressions are presented to
   estimate gas fluxes due to the combined effects of Knudsen diffusion,
   multicomponent molecular diffusion, and viscous flow.  These expressions
   are used to evaluate the validity of the single-component
   advection-dispersion equation for simulating gas transport in the
   presence of atmospheric pressure variations.  The single-component
   equation provides reasonable results when used to simulate transport in
   media with relatively high gas permeability.  Computer simulations of
   vertical transport at sites with homogeneous soils indicate that
   ``fresh{''} air can migrate several meters into the subsurface during a
   typical barometric pressure cycle.  Horizontal pressure gradients can
   develop at sites with near-surface heterogeneities.  These gradients may
   cause fresh air to intrude meters or tens of meters into the vadose zone
   during a storm event.}},

Abstract = {{The Lagrangian framework presented by Dagan et al. (1992a) is used to
   analyze the uncertainty in predictions of the field scale mass flux of
   solute through the unsaturated zone.  Transport of both nonreactive and
   degradable solutes is investigated for input sources that are located at
   the soil surface of fields with spatially variable hydraulic
   conductivity at saturation.  The variances of the solute flux and
   accumulated mass, which quantify the corresponding prediction
   uncertainties, are illustrated at an arbitrary depth below the soil
   surface for different sizes and shapes of the input domain, and for
   different flow and degradation conditions.  The greatest solute flux
   variances arise when the expected breakthrough curve has a steep slope. 
   The coefficient of variation for the solute flux is minimum at the peak
   arrival time of the expected breakthrough curve; this minimum value is
   relatively insensitive to the assumed distribution for solute travel
   time and to the loss rate coefficient for degradable solute.  The
   prediction uncertainty decreases with increasing size of the input
   domain and is smaller for a planar source than for a linear one.  The
   relative uncertainty in the total leached mass of degradable solute
   increases with increasing loss rate coefficient.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of accurate information stemming from soil variability and climatic
   uncertainty obstructs efficient irrigation management. State-space
   models of soil water balance and potential evapotranspiration were used
   in the application of spatial-temporal estimation methods to reduce
   uncertainty. Temporal soil water storage estimates and estimation errors
   were obtained by the Kalman filter (KF). Spatial estimates were obtained
   by the conditional multivariate normal method. These spatial and
   temporal estimates were combined by an additional KF step that considers
   spatial estimates as measurements. Time-dependent soil water spatial
   covariance was approximated by assuming a constant correlation range and
   by using measurements variance to estimate the variogram ``sill.{''}
   Simulation and field results indicate that soil water storage estimates
   by the proposed method agreed better with measurements than estimates
   based on either spatial or temporal information only. The proposed
   estimation scheme can be extended to other systems with a simple
   physical model and a known spatial structure where only a few field
   measurements are available.}},

Abstract = {{Previous results of stochastic analysis of variable density and
   viscosity fluids in heterogeneous isotropic porous media show that
   longitudinal macrodispersivity is a function of mean concentration and
   concentration gradient.  The dependence of macrodispersivity on mean
   concentration and concentration gradient gives rise to a nonlinear mean
   solute transport equation.  To evaluate this behavior, a one-dimensional
   finite difference formulation of the mean solute transport equation that
   incorporates the analytically derived expression for longitudinal
   macrodispersivity is used to simulate a step input problem.  This
   approach allows effects of a spatially and temporally varying
   macrodispersivity on breakthrough curves to be observed and effects on
   dispersed-zone width to be calculated.  Simulation results show that,
   for solute concentrations of environmental significance, density effects
   give rise to macrodispersivities up to several orders of magnitude
   larger (for the unstable (fingering) case) or smaller (for the stable
   case) than would be predicted by analysis of an ideal tracer, and the
   smaller the velocity, the greater the effect.  In miscible secondary
   petroleum recovery, where the displaced and displacing fluids differ in
   concentration by as much as 100\%, viscosity effects have the
   predominant influence on macrodispersivity; in this case, simulations
   illustrate that viscous fingering effects give rise to
   macrodispersivities that are several orders of magnitude larger than
   predicted by classical analysis.  Qualitatively these results agree with
   fine-grid numerical simulations of viscous fingering and laboratory
   column experiments in that similar trends are observed for the effects
   of displacement orientation, velocity, and density and viscosity
   contrasts on dispersed-zone width.}},

Abstract = {{The rheology of slurries consisting of less-than-or-equal-to 2-mm
   sediment from a natural debris flow deposit was measured using a
   wide-gap concentric-cylinder viscometer.  The influence of sediment
   concentration and size and distribution of grains on the bulk
   rheological behavior of the slurries was evaluated at concentrations
   ranging from 0.44 to 0.66.  The slurries exhibit diverse rheological
   behavior.  At shear rates above 5 s-1 the behavior approaches that of a
   Bingham material; below 5 s-1, sand exerts more influence and slurry
   behavior deviates from the Bingham idealization.  Sand grain
   interactions dominate the mechanical behavior when sand concentration
   exceeds 0.2; transient fluctuations in measured torque, time-dependent
   decay of torque, and hysteresis effects are observed.  Grain rubbing,
   interlocking, and collision cause changes in packing density, particle
   distribution, grain orientation, and formation and destruction of grain
   clusters, which may explain the observed behavior.  Yield strength and
   plastic viscosity exhibit order-of-magnitude variation when sediment
   concentration changes as little as 2-4\%.  Owing to these complexities,
   it is unlikely that debris flows can be characterized by a single
   rheological model.}},

Abstract = {{Proper mathematical description of multiphase fluid displacement in
   porous media requires specification of appropriate constitutive
   relations, including the relationship between capillary pressure and
   saturation.  This pressure-saturation relationship may be measured at
   the laboratory core scale, but extension to larger scales is difficult
   in heterogeneous materials.  To date, stochastic and volume averaging
   methods have been used to estimate the ``effective{''}
   pressure-saturation relation in heterogeneous media.  A third method,
   based on network percolation models, may be developed and used to define
   effective relationships.  This last method is appealing in that pore
   scale physics are directly incorporated into the model, assumptions are
   clear, and numerical tests are most similar to those performed in the
   laboratory.  Numerical results based on network models indicate that
   heterogeneities have a significant impact on the effective relationship.
   In addition, these results indicate that application of any sort of
   linear averaging of the individual small-scale relationships to define
   an effective relationship may provide incorrect results.}},

Abstract = {{Policy selection for guiding the allocation of water resources has long
   been debated among economists and policymakers.  Economists have been
   prone to recommend water marketing on theoretical grounds, but the
   appraisal of realistic opportunities for employing market institutions
   requires analysis of actual markets.  Twenty years of market activity in
   the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas are reviewed along with the
   historical development of water law in Texas and procedural requirements
   for transferring water rights.  Developed data indicate active water
   marketing practices with significant volumes of agricultural water
   having been sold to municipalities.  For transactions involving
   representative cities, estimated municipal benefits from water marketing
   are determined to far exceed the agricultural costs of the transfer. 
   Attention to the unique circumstances of this region is required prior
   to extending results to other areas.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A study of flow resistance was undertaken in a channelized reach of the
   North Fork Toutle River, downstream of Mount St. Helens, Washington. 
   Hydraulic and sediment transport data were collected in flows with
   velocities up to 3 m/s and shear stresses up to 7 times the critical
   value needed for bed load transport.  Details of the flow structure as
   revealed in vertical velocity profiles indicate that weak bed load
   transport over a plane gravel bed has little effect on flow resistance. 
   The plane gravel bed persists up to stresses approximately 3 times
   critical, at which point, irregular bed forms appear.  Bed forms greatly
   increase flow resistance and cause velocity profiles to become
   distorted.  The latter arises as an effect of flows becoming
   depth-limited as bed form amplitude increases.  At very high rates of
   bed load transport, an upper stage plane bed appeared.  Velocity
   profiles measured in these flows match the law of the wall closely, with
   the equivalent roughness being well represented by k(s) = 3D84 of the
   bed load.  The effects noted here will be important in very large floods
   or in rivers that are not free to widen, such as those cut into bedrock.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical experiments are applied to the problem of modeling base flow
   water quality originating from nonpoint or spatially distributed sources
   of groundwater contamination in an idealized stream-aquifer setting. 
   The experiments examine the dependence of base flow concentration on
   stochastic spatial variability of the nonpoint source, the initial
   aquifer concentration field, and the hydraulic conductivity field.  The
   deterministic effects of local dispersive mixing, aquifer aspect ratio,
   and equilibrium sorption are also investigated.  For the simulated
   conditions, base flow concentration is found to be independent of
   second-spatial moments of the above random parameter fields and
   independent of the magnitude of local dispersive mixing.  The
   experiments demonstrate the primary importance of defining the mean flow
   field and the space average concentration when determining
   ``effective{''} field parameters.  Input-output behavior is represented
   by a nondiffusive integral balance model with exponential or
   Weibull-type kernel.  Parameters of the integral balance model are shown
   to be adequately represented by space averages.}},

Abstract = {{The factors that control the transport of bacteria through porous media
   are not well understood.  The relative importance of the processes of
   dispersion, of immobilization of bacterial cells by various mechanisms
   (deposition), and of subsequent release of these trapped cells
   (entrainment) in describing transport has not been elucidated
   experimentally.  Moreover, the variability of the phenomenological
   coefficients used to model these processes, given changes in such
   primary factors as grain size, organism, and ionic strength of the
   water, is unknown.  We report results of fitting solutions of an
   advection-dispersion equation, modified to account for deposition and
   entrainment, to breakthrough curves from packed sand columns using two
   sizes of sand, two ionic strengths of the carrier solution, and two
   organisms with different sizes.  A solution to the advection-dispersion
   equation including three processes, that is, dispersion, deposition, and
   entrainment, provides a match to the data that is superior to that
   achieved by solutions ignoring one of the processes.  Fitted values of
   the coefficient describing deposition vary in a consistent manner with
   the control variables (organism, grain size, and ionic strength) and are
   generally within one order of magnitude of those predicted on the basis
   of theory.}},

Abstract = {{Hilly or mountainous topography influences gravity-driven groundwater
   flow and the consequent distribution of effective stress in shallow
   subsurface environments.  Effective stress, in turn, influences the
   potential for slope failure.  To evaluate these influences, we formulate
   a two-dimensional, steady state, poroelastic model.  The governing
   equations incorporate groundwater effects as body forces, and they
   demonstrate that spatially uniform pore pressure changes do not
   influence effective stresses.  We implement the model using two finite
   element codes.  As an illustrative case, we calculate the groundwater
   flow field, total body force field, and effective stress field in a
   straight, homogeneous hillslope.  The total body force and effective
   stress fields show that groundwater flow can influence shear stresses as
   well as effective normal stresses.  In most parts of the hillslope,
   groundwater flow significantly increases the Coulomb failure potential
   PHI, which we define as the ratio of maximum shear stress to mean
   effective normal stress.  Groundwater flow also shifts the locus of
   greatest failure potential toward the slope toe.  However, the effects
   of groundwater flow on failure potential are less pronounced than might
   be anticipated on the basis of a simpler, one-dimensional, limit
   equilibrium analysis.  This is a consequence of continuity,
   compatibility, and boundary constraints on the two-dimensional flow and
   stress fields, and it points to important differences between our
   elastic continuum model and limit equilibrium models commonly used to
   assess slope stability.}},

Abstract = {{Hillslope morphology, material properties, and hydraulic heterogeneities
   influence the role of groundwater flow in provoking slope instability. 
   We evaluate these influences quantitatively by employing the elastic
   effective stress model and Coulomb failure potential concept described
   in our companion paper (Iverson and Reid, this issue).  Sensitivity
   analyses show that of four dimensionless quantities that control model
   results (i.e., Poisson's ratio, porosity, topographic profile, and
   hydraulic conductivity contrast), slope profiles and hydraulic
   conductivity contrasts have the most pronounced and diverse effects on
   groundwater seepage forces, effective stresses, and slope failure
   potentials.  Gravity-driven groundwater flow strongly influences the
   shape of equilibrium hillslopes, which we define as those with uniform
   near-surface failure potentials.  For homogeneous slopes with no
   groundwater flow, equilibrium hillslope profiles are straight; but with
   gravity-driven flow, equilibrium profiles are concave or convex-concave,
   and the largest failure potentials exist near the bases of convex
   slopes.  In heterogeneous slopes, relatively slight hydraulic
   conductivity contrasts of less than 1 order of magnitude markedly affect
   the seepage force field and slope failure potential.  Maximum effects
   occur if conductivity contrasts are of four orders of magnitude or more,
   and large hydraulic gradients commonly result in particularly large
   failure potentials just upslope from where low-conductivity layers
   intersect the ground surface.}},

Abstract = {{Several well-known evaporation equations were tested with daily data
   averaged over six stations in a 15 x 15 km region in Kansas.  The
   equilibrium evaporation and advection-aridity evaporation equations
   produced acceptable results, under the generally moist conditions
   encountered, with the former performing slightly better.  Three methods
   tested also required soil moisture (SM) availability data.  These were
   the Penman and equilibrium evaporation equations adjusted with
   SM-dependent coefficients, and the Penman-Monteith formulation with
   surface resistance.  All three gave significantly better performances
   than the unadjusted equilibrium equation.  In general, it appeared that
   the use of simple temporal (daily) and spatial averages may not be
   appropriate, especially under conditions of variable SM.  The Penman,
   equilibrium, and advection-aridity evaporation equations are linear
   combinations of the same two terms, with different coefficients.  The
   optimal values of these coefficients, determined for various ranges of
   SM, were consistent with the underlying physical models.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of a bubble plume discharging vertically into a stably
   stratified water column is described using a simple one-dimensional
   plume model. It is confirmed that the behavior can be described with
   just two dimensionless groupings, C and M, representative of the
   strength of the stratification and the discharge momentum. Depending on
   the values of these parameters, the plume can either extend the full
   depth of the water column or eject water at one or more internal
   detrainment points. The occurrence of these internal detrainment points
   can be described in terms of the relative magnitudes of the terms
   comprising the buoyancy conservation equation. Further, these internal
   detrainment points can be linked to both the mechanical efficiency and
   mixing effectiveness of bubble plumes. This is of importance when the
   bubble plume is being used to act as a destratification device in a
   lake. Generally, an integral number of internal detrainment points
   correspond to peak mechanical efficiencies. Maximum mixing effectiveness
   is favored by lower values of the stratification parameter C and higher
   values of the source strength parameter M.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model was derived to examine the impact of gas advection,
   gas diffusion, gas-water mass transfer, gas-water partitioning,
   sorption, and intraaggregate diffusion on subsurface movement of organic
   vapors. Laboratory experiments were performed to determine the validity
   of the model and to investigate the impact of the various mechanisms on
   vapor transport. Columns were packed with a uniform Ottawa sand and an
   aggregated porous soil material (APSM) to compare transport in different
   soil structures. Toluene vapor transport was observed in the sand under
   dry and wet (27\% water saturation) conditions. The experiments with the
   APSM were performed dry and at 67\% water saturation. In all the sand
   and the dry APSM experiments, gas advection and diffusion had the
   greatest impact. In a wet APSM experiment, intraaggregate (liquid)
   diffusion was also important to consider for gas velocities greater than
   approximately 0.05 cm s-1. For both soil materials, sorption of toluene
   vapors occurred for dry conditions, while vapor sorption was negligible
   when liquid water was present. These findings imply that vapor
   extraction performance in moist, aggregated soils will be affected by
   nonequilibrium transport. Therefore models that are developed for
   predicting the complete removal of contaminants by vapor extraction must
   account for nonequilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{A model for the entrainment and bed load transport of sediment grains of
   different sizes, shapes and densities by a unidirectional turbulent flow
   is developed in terms of (1) sediment types available for transport; (2)
   the mean and turbulent fluctuating values of fluid forces acting upon
   the sediment grains; and (3) the nature of the interaction between
   turbulent fluid forces and available sediment, resulting in entrainment
   and transport of grains as bed load or in suspension. The behavior of
   the model is explored extensively, and compared with natural data from
   flumes and rivers. The predicted threshold of entrainment of individual
   size fractions within a mixed-size bed agrees well with observations as
   long as the pivoting angle is specified appropriately as a function of
   grain size. The rate and size distribution of bed load transport
   generally agrees well with natural data as long as effective bed shear
   stress in the presence of bed forms can be defined, bed load transport
   measurements are reliable, and the size distribution of available
   sediment is accurately specified.}},

Abstract = {{A new kind of free boundary is introduced, namely, the projection on the
   horizontal plane of the interzonal boundary between a seepage face and a
   phreatic surface. This ``seepage boundary{''} is demonstrated to show
   certain mathematical similarities to a phreatic surface, viewed in a
   vertical plane. A variation on Zhukovski's method is employed to derive
   a formula for the deformation of the seepage boundary on the side of a
   hill due to groundwater withdrawal. The modified Zhukovski function,
   being many valued, is handled by Strack's extension of the
   Schwartz-Christoffel transformation. It is finally pointed out that more
   complicated problems could be solved by a modified hodograph method.}},

Abstract = {{An exact mathematical solution to Laplace's equation is presented for
   appropriate boundary conditions associated with the problem of dual-pipe
   subirrigation and drainage. The solution can be used to determine a flow
   net within the groundwater flow region and the associated water table
   shape. The solution is general. The effects of several hydraulic and
   geometrical parameters on the groundwater system, such as thickness of
   saturated zone, position of subirrigation and drainage pipes, heads in
   the subirrigation and drainage pipes, crop evapotranspiration, fraction
   of inflowing subirrigation water that exits through the drains, and the
   aquifer hydraulic conductivity system are evaluated. Calculations are
   presented showing how pipe spacing affects the shape of the water table.
   For example, with hydraulic conductivity of 10 m/d, evapotranspiration
   of 0.01 m/d, drainpipe radius of 0.05 m, and subirrigation pipe radius
   of 0.0375 m, calculations show that the maximum water table elevation
   for a pipe spacing of 40 m is 0.64 m greater than for a pipe spacing of
   16 m when 40\% of the input subirrigation water volume is being removed
   from the system by drainage. Finally, the general mathematical solution
   can be used to predict chemical movement as well as water flow through
   the system.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration, major fractions, and contribution of dissolved

   streams (East and West Bear Brooks) draining upland catchments in
   eastern Maine. Concentrations of DOC in East and West Bear Brooks were
   183 +/- 73 and 169 +/- 70-mu-mol C L-1 (mean plus or minus one standard
   deviation), respectively. Organic acids were the dominant fractions of
   the stream DOC, with hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic acids
   representing 44 and 39\% of total DOC (average of both streams),
   respectively. East and West Bear Brooks had mean organic anion
   concentrations of about 20-mu-eq L-1 during episodic events and
   12-13-mu-eq L-1 during base flow. During the episodic events, the
   maximum organic anion values were 51 and 36-mu-eq L-1, respectively, for
   East and West Bear Brooks. Although SO42- was the dominant stream anion,
   followed by Cl-, organic anions were also determined to be an important
   component of these stream waters, especially during storm events. This
   illustrates that even in streams with low DOC, such as those studied
   here, organic anions can contribute significantly to stream acidity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a procedure to upscale unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity from the scale at which it is measured to a scale more
   amenable to actual flow simulations in partially saturated heterogeneous
   porous formations. In the approach adopted here the block conductivity
   is defined as the ratio of volume-averaged flux to the volume-averaged
   head gradient. The ``point{''} values of the underlying formation
   properties (characterized by the saturated conductivity K(S) and the
   pore size distribution parameter alpha) are viewed as realizations of
   independent random spatial functions. The general approach is applied to
   a partially saturated, heterogeneous, three-dimensional statistically
   anisotropic formation, with statistical isotropy in the horizontal plane
   and arbitrarily oriented stratification characterized by a finite aspect
   ratio, for the case where the mean gradient exists only in the vertical
   direction. The procedure is illustrated by providing a second-order
   approximation of the mean (in terms of the components of the block
   conductivity tensor) and a first-order approximation of the covariance
   function of the block conductivity, which depend on the mean capillary
   pressure head H, the distribution of the ``point{''} values of the
   underlying log unsaturated conductivity, and the block size. The results
   of this study allow assessment of the minimal domain size for which the
   concept of effective properties is appropriate and assessment of the

Abstract = {{We report the first measurements of friction angles for a naturally
   formed gravel streambed. For a given test grain size placed on a bed
   surface, friction angles varied from 10-degrees to over 100-degrees;
   friction angle distributions can be expressed as a function of test
   grain size, median bed grain size, and bed sorting parameter. Friction
   angles decrease with increasing grain size relative to the median bed
   grain size, and are a systematic function of sorting, with lower
   friction angles associated with poorer sorting. The probability
   distributions of critical shear stress for different grain sizes on a
   given bed surface, as calculated from our friction angle data, show a
   common origin, but otherwise diverge with larger grains having narrower
   and lower ranges of critical shear stresses. The potential mobility of a
   grain, as defined by its probability distribution of critical shear
   stress, may be overestimated for larger grains in this analysis, because
   our calculations do not take into account the effects of grain burial
   and altered near-bed flow fields.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{The relationship of sorptivity S and macroscopic capillary length
   lambda(c) is explored. Sorptivity is the proportionality constant
   between cumulative intake, expressed as a length, and the square root of
   time for sorption into an unsaturated soil. The capillary length is
   defined as the integral of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity with
   respect to matric potential normalized by the difference between the
   conductivity at the two limits of integration. The approximation b =
   lambda(c)(theta(wet) - theta(dry)(K(wet - K(dry)S-2 was found previously
   to have bounds of 0.5 and pi/4, with 0.55 as a good overall
   approximation. Those results were for two diffusivity functions, an
   exponential D = D0 exp (B-theta) and for D = D0(theta(b) - theta)-2. We
   now extend the investigation to four additional cases, two for which S
   and lambda(c) are analytical and two described by the empirical
   hydraulic functions of Brooks and Corey (1964) and by van Genuchten
   (1980). The representative value b = 0.55 was found to be generally
   correct. For those functions with a finite D value at the wettest value,
   a refinement from the 0.55 value is offered. The results are believed of
   value for future parameter estimation problems, including two previous
   applications related to time of ponding and disk infiltrometers.}},

Abstract = {{A multidimensional integral finite difference numerical simulator is
   developed for modeling the steam displacement of nonaqueous phase liquid
   (NAPL) contaminants in shallow subsurface systems. This code, named
   STMVOC, considers three flowing phases, gas, aqueous, and NAPL; and
   three mass components, air, water, and an organic chemical. Interphase
   mass transfer of the components between any of the phases is calculated
   by assuming local chemical equilibrium between the phases, and
   adsorption of the chemical to the soil is included. Heat transfer occurs
   due to conduction and multiphase convection and includes latent heat
   effects. A general equation of state is implemented in the code for
   calculating the thermophysical properties of the NAPL/chemical. This
   equation of state is primarily based on corresponding states methods of
   property estimation using a chemical's critical constants. The necessary
   constants are readily available for several hundred hazardous organic
   liquid chemicals. In part 2 (Falta et al., this issue), the code is used
   to simulate two one-dimensional laboratory steam injection experiments
   and to examine the effect of NAPL properties on the steam displacement
   process.}},

Abstract = {{The multiphase steam injection simulator developed in part 1 (Falta et
   al., this issue) is used to simulate two laboratory column steam
   displacement experiments. In the first simulation, steam is injected
   into a clean, water-saturated column, while in the second simulation,
   steam is injected into a column containing both water and separate phase
   trichloroethylene. In both cases, the numerical results are in good
   quantitative agreement with the experimental data. Based on the
   assumption of local chemical equilibrium between the phases, a simple
   criterion is derived for determining the major mechanism of nonaqueous
   phase liquid (NAPL)/chemical transport during the steam displacement
   process. Several one-dimensional simulations of the steam displacement
   of high-boiling-point NAPLs are discussed. These results are consistent
   with theoretical predictions and indicate that steam may efficiently
   displace organic liquids having boiling points substantially greater
   than that of water.}},

Abstract = {{Organic liquids that are essentially immiscible with water migrate
   through the subsurface under the influence of capillary, viscous, and
   buoyancy forces. These liquids originate from the improper disposal of
   hazardous wastes, and the spills and leaks of petroleum hydrocarbons and
   solvents. The flow visualization experiments described in this study
   examined the migration of organic liquids through the saturated zone of
   aquifers, with a primary focus on the behavior of the residual organic
   liquid saturation, referring to that portion of the organic liquid that
   is trapped by capillary forces. Etched glass micromodels were used to
   visually observe dynamic multiphase displacement processes in pore
   networks. The resulting fluid distributions were photographed. Pore and
   blob casts were produced by a technique in which an organic liquid was
   solidified in place within a sand column at the conclusion of a
   displacement. The columns were sectioned and examined under optical and
   scanning electron microscopes. Photomicrographs of these sections show
   the morphology of the organic phase and its location within the sand
   matrix. The photographs from both experimental techniques reveal that in
   the saturated zone large amounts of residual organic liquid are trapped
   as isolated blobs of microscopic size. The size, shape, and spatial
   distribution of these blobs of residual organic liquid affect the
   dissolution of organic liquid into the water phase and the
   biotransformation of organic components. These processes are of concern
   for the prediction of pollution migration and the design of aquifer
   remediation schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph is obtained by dividing
   the whole catchment into subcatchments, according to the different
   ``path types{''} which water follows to the outlet of catchment. Each
   subcatchment produces, at its own outlet, an impulse response which is
   described by a two-parameter (n, K) gamma function. In traveling to the
   outlet of whole catchment, each impulse response undergoes a further
   pure translation with delay time-tau, thus producing at the outlet of
   the catchment a partial impulse response described by three parameters
   (n, K, and tau). Summation of these partial impulse responses with area
   weights W forms the impulse response of whole catchment. The parameters
   K and tau are estimated from catchment characteristics and the flow
   velocity of each flood event. Area weights W can be calculated from maps
   after defining the subcatchments. The parameter n is estimated by
   optimization. The proposed model is tested in two catchments in China
   and shows encouraging results.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{The real-time operation of a reservoir is a matter of trade-off between
   the two criteria of risk aversion (to avoid dramatic failures) and
   average-performance optimization (to yield the best long-term average
   performance). A methodology taking into account both criteria is
   presented in this paper to derive ``off-line{''} infinite-horizon
   control policies for a single multipurpose reservoir, where the
   management goals are water supply and flood control. According to this
   methodology, the reservoir control policy is derived in two steps:
   First, a (min-max) risk aversion problem is formulated, whose solution
   is not unique, but rather a whole set of policies, all equivalent from
   the point of view of the risk-aversion objectives. Second, a stochastic
   average-performance optimization problem is solved, to select from the
   set previously obtained the best policy from the point of view of the
   average-performance objectives. The methodology has several interesting
   features: the min-max (or ``guaranteed performance{''}) approach, which
   is particularly suited whenever ``weak{''} users are affected by the
   consequences of the decision-making process; the flexible definition of
   a ``risk aversion degree,{''} by the selection of those inflow sequences
   which are particularly feared; and the two-objective analysis which
   provides the manager with a whole set of alternatives among which he
   (she) will select the one that yields the desired trade-off between the
   management goals.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The ability to simulate contaminant migration in large-scale porous
   formations containing a complex network of discrete fractures is limited
   by traditional modeling approaches. One primary reason is because of
   vastly different transport time scales in different regions due to rapid
   advection along the discrete fractures and slow but persistent diffusion
   in the porous matrix. In addition to time-related complexities, standard
   numerical methods require a fine spatial discretization in the porous
   matrix to represent sharp concentration gradients at the interface
   between the fractures and the matrix. In order to circumvent these
   difficulties, the Laplace transform Galerkin method is extended for
   application to discretely fractured media with emphasis on large-scale
   modeling capabilities. The technique avoids time stepping and permits
   the use of a relatively coarse grid without compromising accuracy
   because the Laplace domain solution is relatively smooth and devoid of
   discontinuities even in advection-dominated problems. Further
   computational efficiency for large-grid problems is achieved by
   employing a preconditioned, ORTHOMIN-accelerated iterative solver. A
   unique feature of the method is that each of the several needed p space
   solutions are independent, thus making the scheme highly parallel. Other
   features include the accommodation of advective-dispersive transport in
   the porous matrix and the straightforward inclusion of dual-porosity
   theory to represent matrix diffusion in regions where microfractures
   exist below the modeling scale. An example problem involving contaminant
   transport through an aquitard into an underlying aquifer leads to the
   conclusion that deep, essentially undetectable fractures in clayey
   aquitards can greatly compromise the quality of groundwater in the
   impacted aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the degree to which vertically fractured clayey
   aquitards protect an underlying aquifer from near-surface sources of
   contamination. Evidence from field studies indicates that many clayey
   aquitards previously assumed to be unfractured at depth have vertical
   fractures that actively transmit groundwater. Calculated groundwater
   velocities within these fractures can exceed several meters per day for
   apertures in the range of those reported to occur in clays. If this is
   the case, significant quantities of dissolved contaminants originating
   in near-surface zones may move rapidly downward through the fracture
   network into underlying aquifers. A two-dimensional Laplace transform
   Galerkin finite element model (Sudicky and McLaren, this issue) was used
   to assess the importance of idealized planar vertical fractures on flow
   and solute transport through a 15-m-thick aquitard and subsequent plume
   evolution within an underlying aquifer in which groundwater flows
   horizontally. Sensitivity analyses indicate that solute transport
   through the aquitard is strongly affected by downward flow in widely
   spaced deep fractures with apertures as small as 10-mu-m and that a
   plume of large lateral extent and significant concentration forms within
   the underlying aquifer in a few tens of years for apertures of the order
   of 20-mu-m or much sooner if the apertures are 50-mu-m. This finding
   suggests that small hydraulically active fractures that are very
   difficult to detect or identify within an otherwise protective clayey
   barrier may cause rapid and large-scale contamination of groundwater
   beneath the barrier.}},

Abstract = {{Landsat and GOES satellite data are used in analyzing monthly water
   budgets on a 538-km2 watershed in central Oklahoma for 1984-1985. The
   budget components examined are water yield, percolation loss,
   evapotranspiration and change in soil water content. The hydrologic
   model employed is SWRRB (Simulator for Water Resources in Rural Basins)
   developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture. Landsat imagery is used to subdivide the basin into land
   covers for model application. The land cover subareas are more
   homogeneous than subbasins with mixed vegetation and their use allows
   tracking of the unique contribution of each type of cover to the water
   budget. Daily insolation is determined from GOES imagery. A comparison
   of budget components based on pyranometer insolation versus unbiased
   GOES estimates shows a maximum difference less than 4\% and 5 mm for any
   component of the annual and monthly budgets, respectively.
   Satellite-derived temperatures are simulated by adding systematic and
   random errors to observed temperatures. A temperature bias of a few
   degrees greatly changes the growing season and monthly budgets of winter
   wheat.}},

Abstract = {{In a brief but fundamental review of the evolution of the conventional
   numerical techniques used in the solution of convection-dominated
   transport problems, we explore the difficulties that have been remedied
   to various degrees by various workers. In the course of this review we
   obtain the performance characteristic of the Crank-Nicolson Galerkin
   finite element method in the form of a curve in Peclet number and
   Courant number space. We show that the performance can be altered
   through a new upwind parameter that can easily be incorporated into many
   of the existing numerical solution methods. By providing an insight into
   the limitations of some of these methods we demonstrate, by means of
   numerical experiments, that the proposed upwinding procedure ensures
   acceptable solutions throughout the Pe-Cr space at a reasonable cost of
   the smearing effect.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a spatial stochastic model for drainage networks defined on a
   square lattice of points. The probability of a particular spanning tree
   s draining a given basin represented by a set of lattice points is
   proportional to exp {[}-beta-H(s)], where beta is a parameter to be
   estimated and H(s) is defined to be the difference between total flow
   distance to the outlet through the drainage tree and total distance
   along shortest paths to the outlet. Thus H(s) is a global measure of
   sinuosity of the channels constituting the drainage tree. This
   probability distribution on trees is known as Gibbs' distribution and is
   well known in statistical mechanical contexts. The distribution with
   beta = 0 (a uniform distribution) has been studied in a previous paper
   by the authors and was found to yield networks that are too sinuous. In
   this paper, beta is allowed to be greater than zero, which produces more
   realistic networks that are not as sinuous. The question of spatial
   variability of beta is addressed from an equilibrium point of view using
   ideas from statistical mechanics. To examine the question of spatial
   variability, the parameter-beta is defined in a Bayesian sense and
   allowed to vary randomly from basin to basin. In a case study we express
   beta in terms of a log linear model with three independent variables:
   pixel size (grid spacing), drainage area, and average channel slope. We
   then estimate the parameters of this model with a set of 50 drainage
   trees obtained using digital elevation data for Willow Creek in Montana.
   Parameter estimates indicate that beta tends to vary directly with slope
   and inversely with drainage area, which suggests heterogeneities within
   larger basins that are not adequately accounted for by Gibbs'
   distribution with a constant parameter value.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns and rates of chemical evolution of groundwater in a sandy
   silicate aquifer were determined by detailed analysis of groundwater
   velocity and chemistry along short (120 m) flow paths. Groundwater
   enters the aquifer mainly as seepage from a dilute lake and evolves
   chemically under open-CO2 conditions for at least 8 years before
   discharging to another lake. Spatial trends in the aquifer are evident
   for calcium, magnesium, silicon, sodium, CO2, alkalinity, pH,
   temperature, and dissolved oxygen. The kinetics of silicate mineral
   dissolution regulates additions of calcium, magnesium, and alkalinity to
   the groundwater, causing them to increase steadily along flow paths at
   about 12-mu-mol L-1 yr-1 (Ca), 6-mu-mol L-1 yr-1 (Mg), and 39-mu-eq L-1
   yr-1 (alkalinity) respectively, for at least 3-5 years. Silicon and
   sodium increase by 41-mu-mol L-1 yr-1 and 13-mu-mol L-1 yr-1
   respectively for about 3 years, then level off as the groundwater
   approaches saturation with respect to kaolinite and smectite.}},

Abstract = {{Major chemical trends along flow paths in a sandy silicate aquifer
   (Kenoyer and Bowser, this issue) are interpreted using a mass balance
   approach and reaction simulation modeling. Because of the diverse
   mineral assemblage present and uncertainties in the thermodynamic
   constants, it is not possible to derive a unique solution. However,
   considering relative reaction kinetics and mineral abundance, a model
   involving the dissolution of plagioclase and small amounts of biotite
   and pyroxene to kaolinite in an open-CO2 system is a simple,
   thermodynamically valid and reasonable explanation for the major
   chemical changes. The favored reaction model would result in apparent
   rates of dissolution of 2 x 10(-18) mol cm-2 s-1 plagioclase (An41), 3 x
   10(-20) mol cm-2 s-1 biotite, and 3 x 10(-17) mol cm-2 s-1 diopside.
   These rates are lower than published rates from laboratory studies, that
   range from 10(-11) to 10(-17) mol cm-2 s-1 for plagioclase, but are in
   the same range as rates derived from field studies. In predictive
   simulations where current silicate dissolution rates are assumed to hold
   constant but the pH of the recharge water is lowered from 6.4 to 3.99
   (simulating increasing acidity of precipitation), the pH and alkalinity
   of the groundwater are reduced significantly.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A model for the optimal operating policy of a reservoir for irrigation
   under a multiple crops scenario using stochastic dynamic programming
   (SDP) is developed. Intraseasonal periods smaller than the crop growth
   stage durations form the decision intervals of the model to facilitate
   irrigation decisions in real situations. Reservoir storage, inflow to
   the reservoir, and the soil moisture in the irrigated area are treated
   as state variables. An optimal allocation process is incorporated in the
   model to determine the allocations to individual crops when a
   competition for water exists among them. The model also serves as an
   irrigation scheduling model in that at any given intraseason period it
   specifies whether irrigation is needed and, if it is, the amount of
   irrigation to be applied to each crop. The impact on crop yield due to
   water deficit and the effect of soil moisture dynamics on crop water
   requirements are taken into account. A linear root growth of the crop is
   assumed until the end of the vegetative stage, beyond which the root
   depth is assumed to be constant. The applicability of the model is
   demonstrated through a case study of an existing reservoir in India.}},

Abstract = {{This study addresses regional adjustments to possible reductions in
   water availability which may occur with a future climate change. The
   study assesses potential responses of urban water suppliers to reduced
   water availability by examining an analogous case of reduced supply in
   the Denver metropolitan region. In this case the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's veto of a large surface storage project (the Two
   Forks dam) prompted water providers in metropolitan Denver to take other
   actions to ensure adequate future water supply. In some cases, actions
   taken since the veto process began represent a departure from previous
   water provider policies. It is argued that similar institutional
   adjustments may occur due to climate change-induced reductions in
   regional water supplies and that useful lessons may be drawn from an
   analysis of institutional responses to the Two Forks veto. This paper
   introduces what is envisioned as a long-term assessment of regional
   adjustments to reduced future water supplies.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves have
   been scaled independently with separate scale factors calculated for
   each curve. Here we provide a method to scale both hydraulic functions
   simultaneously to yield a single set of scaling factors. An algorithm
   was developed to scale the hydraulic data, either as a function of
   degree of saturation S, or normalized water content-THETA. Optimization
   using Powell's method in combination with a Newton-Raphson procedure
   resulted in one set of parameters representing the scaled mean hydraulic
   functions and one set of scale factors describing the variability of
   both the retention and conductivity relationships. We present and
   compare results obtained from (1) scaling water retention data only; (2)
   scaling hydraulic conductivity data only; (3) simultaneous scaling of
   soil water pressure head h and the natural logarithm of hydraulic
   conductivity K; and (4) simultaneous scaling of the logarithms of both h
   and K. Sets of scale factors for two data sets were analyzed for
   distribution type and autocorrelation.}},

Abstract = {{A general model is presented that simulates the effect of an immobile
   immiscible organic liquid, as well as rate-limited solid phase sorption,
   on the transport of dissolved organic contaminants in heterogeneous
   porous media. Specific models are developed for four cases (1) immobile
   immiscible liquid that resides in nonadvective domains, of a
   heterogeneous porous medium; (2) immobile immiscible liquid that resides
   in the advective domain; (3) homogeneous porous media wherein mass
   transfer within the immiscible liquid, as well as across the
   liquid-water interface, is rate limited; (4) homogeneous porous media
   with a single resistance to liquid-liquid mass transfer. The performance
   of the homogeneous-based, single-resistance model was evaluated by
   attempting to predict a breakthrough curve reported in the literature.
   Based on the successful prediction of the data, where values for all
   parameters were obtained independent of the data being simulated, it
   appears that the conceptual basis of the model is valid. Through a
   series of simulations, the effect of the immiscible liquid on retention
   was shown to be great, even at relatively low levels of saturation.
   Release of solute from residual saturation located within regions
   of-relatively low hydraulic conductivity can be significantly rate
   limited, even when mass transfer between immiscible liquid and water is
   rapid. This has ramifications concerning the efficacy of remediation
   systems based on imposed hydraulic gradients (e.g., pump-and-treat). The
   model should prove useful in further investigations of the effect of
   immobile immiscible organic liquids on the retention and transport of
   organic solutes in porous media.}},

Abstract = {{The quasi-linear continuous point source has been central to many
   studies of multidimensional flow in unsaturated soil. Immediately next
   to the source, however, the water pressure PSI is positive and
   indefinitely large, so the quasi-linear flow equation (limited to PSI
   smaller-than-or-equal-to 0) fails in principle. We investigate whether
   this is a serious problem in practice. Exact analysis would be
   complicated and difficult, since the problem is of mixed
   saturated-unsaturated flow with an unknown free boundary between the two
   regions. When the source strength is not too large, the saturated region
   is close to spherical. A simple approximate analysis follows with
   exterior and interior flow velocities matched on the boundary. The
   correction, taking into account the saturated region, shifts the
   quasi-linear source a small distance above the actual source location.
   In practical applications the correction is usually negligibly small.
   Physical reasons why the approximation works well and the correction is
   small are indicated. In addition, these physical reasons suggest that
   the scope of the quasi-linear analysis is wider than supposed hitherto.
   The solution in potential theory for the eccentric point source needed
   for the study is given in the appendix.}},

Abstract = {{Using concepts developed in an earlier study, a solution in Laplace
   transform space is obtained for transport of resident concentration in
   an imperfectly but yet highly stratified porous medium. The flow field,
   into which an instantaneous pulse of tracer is injected, is taken to be
   steady and mean uniform parallel to the direction of stratification.
   From this transform-space solution either temporal moments can be
   derived by taking derivatives with respect to the Laplace parameter, or
   the transform-space solution can be inverted numerically to obtain
   breakthrough curves for the mean concentration. When compared to an
   equivalent solution with a Fickian dispersive flux, these temporal
   moments indicate the extent to which transport in heterogeneous porous
   media deviates from classical Fickian behavior. The numerical inversion
   of the Laplace transform solution gives partial breakthrough curves for
   the mean concentration which have the appearance of conflicting with the
   derived moment information. A hypothesis is put forth which resolves
   this apparent conflict; this hypothesis is verified by adding a
   component of local dispersion to the governing transport equation. On
   the basis of the flux-averaged concentration a form for the expected
   probability density function for the arrival time of a tracer particle
   is derived; arrival time moments and an arrival time cumulative
   distribution function are available as a consequence. Arrival time
   moments, as derived from the flux-averaged concentration, do not differ
   significantly from the resident moments, as derived from the resident
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Practical estimation of long-term daily Great Lakes evaporation requires
   one-dimensional (depth) models of heat storage and mixing. Conceptual
   models are preferable to physical models for small-computer simulations
   that are multiple, continuous, and long. This paper describes a new
   conceptual superposition model of heat storage to extend an existing
   evaporation model along the lake depth. The resulting daily model is
   recalibrated to remotely sensed surface water temperatures and is used
   to illustrate anew seasonal heating and cooling cycles, heat-temperature
   hysteresis, water column turnovers, and mixed-layer developments. It is
   used as well to compare the vertical distribution of temperatures with
   independent bathythermograph data. The time occurrence structure of
   evaporation on the Great Lakes is investigated, and the effects of
   summertime initial conditions on subsequent wintertime behavior of
   evaporation are simulated. Impacts of perceived large-lake thermodynamic
   behavior are analyzed, and suggestions are made for further research.}},

Abstract = {{A new method is developed for the construction of reliable marginal
   confidence intervals and joint confidence regions for the parameters of
   nonlinear, hydrologic regression models. A parameter power
   transformation is combined with measures of the asymptotic bias and
   asymptotic skewness of maximum likelihood estimators to determine the
   transformation constants which cause the bias or skewness to vanish.
   These optimized constants are used to construct confidence intervals and
   regions for the transformed model parameters using linear regression
   theory. The resulting confidence intervals and regions can be easily
   mapped into the original parameter space to give close approximations to
   likelihood method confidence intervals and regions for the model
   parameters. Unlike many other approaches to parameter transformation,
   the procedure does not use a grid search to find the optimal
   transformation constants. An example involving the fitting of the
   Michaelis-Menten model to velocity-discharge data from an Australian
   gauging station is used to illustrate the usefulness of the methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional multivariate data analysis techniques, such as principal
   components analysis (PCA), have often been used in an attempt to
   identify source solutions from potential mixtures, such as stream water.
   Artificial data, generated from conservative mixing of known source
   solutions in random proportions, are employed to demonstrate that PCA
   should be used only to determine the rank of the mixture and not to
   determine the composition of the source solutions. The rank of the
   mixture is related to the number of source solutions. Unambiguous
   identification of the source solution compositions from the mixture
   alone is impossible; thus-it is necessary that potential source
   solutions be derived from independent measurements. In the case of
   stream water, possible source solutions are groundwater and soil water
   from different horizons. A multivariate screening procedure is presented
   for the evaluation of these potential source solutions.}},

Abstract = {{We suggest that dispersion in a saturated porous medium subject to a
   fluctuating pressure gradient can occur as a result of the processes of
   shear (Taylor) dispersion and what we will label rotational dispersion.
   In contrast to shear dispersion, rotational dispersion does not rely on
   molecular diffusion to be effective but requires that the direction of
   the pressure gradient rotates with time. Such rotational gradients are
   ubiquitous in nature, occurring whenever a pressure wave propagates
   across the surface of a porous medium such as soil or marine sediments.
   The efficiency and character of rotational dispersion is investigated
   using Monte Carlo simulations of the dispersal of clouds of particles
   through a highly idealized porous medium. These simulations demonstrate
   that rotational dispersion behaves as a diffusive process and that it
   can be many times more effective than molecular diffusion or shear
   dispersion as a transport mechanism. The results of the theory were
   tested experimentally using a wave tank with a bed of sand as the porous
   medium. These experiments demonstrate that passing waves can greatly
   enhance solute transfer between the bed and the overlying water.
   Furthermore, the measured increases in solute transfer rates are
   quantitatively consistent with the predictions obtained from the theory
   of rotational dispersion presented herein.}},

Abstract = {{Actual evaporation is calculated by means of an advection-aridity
   complementary model which requires, as input, the meteorological data

   that it does not require site-specific calibration. The
   advection-aridity formulation presented here includes the effect of
   atmospheric stability, which can be important to describe the diurnal
   evaporation variation, and a theoretical model of the scalar roughness
   height. A parameterization for advection over the surface of interest is
   incorporated which allows the model to be used for a wide range of
   natural conditions. The model was found to give good agreement with
   evaporation measurements obtained with a large sensitive lysimeter over
   a bare soil field.}},

Abstract = {{A new network design algorithm for improving the reliability of
   groundwater simulation model predictions is developed. The objective of
   the algorithm is to minimize the simulation model prediction variance by
   choice of new aquifer property measurement locations. This method, which
   uses parameter measurements to minimize prediction error, is different
   in concept from conventional parameter estimation or inverse methods
   which use state variable measurements to minimize parameter estimation
   error. The variance of predicted state variables, hydraulic head and
   contaminant concentration, is used as a measure of model prediction
   reliability. Prediction variance depends on the extent and quality of
   aquifer property measurements used to estimate simulation model
   parameters. Kriging is used in the first-order uncertainty analysis to
   estimate the model parameters. First-order uncertainty analysis is used
   in the algorithm to compute the prediction variance and select new
   measurement locations. A network design example is presented, the
   results of which show that a significant increase in simulation model
   prediction reliability is achieved by measuring aquifer properties at
   locations selected by the algorithm. The predicted mean was found to be
   insensitive to new measurements, while the predicted state variable
   variance was found to be quite sensitive to new measurements. The
   selection of measurement locations was found to be greatly affected by
   the type and extent of boundary conditions existing in the aquifer.
   Fixed value boundary conditions tend to reduce prediction variance in
   the neighborhood of new measurements and throughout the entire aquifer.
   Specified flux and mixed boundary conditions tend to reduce prediction
   variance in the neighborhood of the measurement locations, with little
   reduction occurring in other areas of the aquifer. The results also
   indicate that both the mean head and concentration are relatively
   insensitive to the number of data points in the network as long as there
   is a good estimate of the statistics of the ln (K) distribution and
   covariance function. This is not the case with the standard deviation of
   both the head and concentration which are significantly affected by the
   addition of data points to the network.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of density-dependent transport of salt in unconfined coastal
   aquifers is solved numerically by means of an implicit
   Eulerian-Lagrangian finite element formulation. Such a formulation leads
   to symmetric positive definite finite element matrices which are ideally
   suited for efficient solution by preconditioned conjugate gradient
   methods. Additional known advantages of the formulation are
   unconditional stability, reduced numerical dispersion and suitability
   for parallel computation. The method has been used to study the effect
   of dewatering on seawater intrusion within a vertical cross section
   through an aquifer in southern Italy, related to the construction of a
   thermoelectric power plant. To investigate the extent to which the
   dependence of fluid density on salt concentration affects the numerical
   solution, the flow and advection-dispersion equations were solved in
   coupled (iterative), partially coupled (noniterative) and completely
   decoupled modes. Partial coupling was found to yield results very close

Abstract = {{A model was developed to predict the potential contamination of overland
   flow by chemicals removed from soil water by rainfall on sloping soil.
   The model accounts for transient water infiltration and
   convective-dispersive solute transport in the soil and also considers
   rate-limited mass transfer through a laminar boundary layer at the soil
   surface/runoff water interface. Sorption-desorption interactions between
   soil and chemicals are assumed to be subject to linear and nonlinear
   isotherms or to first-order kinetics. The dissolved-chemical
   concentrations at the soil surface and in the surface runoff were
   determined for different antecedent soil moistures and rainfall
   intensities. These concentrations are lower when the antecedent moisture
   is low because the time of ponding for drier soil is longer and because
   during that period soil solutes are displaced by greater volumes of
   infiltrating water. For a specified initial soil water content, higher
   rainfall rates cause higher dissolved-chemical concentrations at the
   soil surface. The degree of nonlinearity of the equilibrium isotherm
   greatly affects the transient dissolved-chemical concentrations and the
   linear isotherm cannot always be used as an alternative. These
   concentrations are also greatly affected by the value of the kinetics
   rate coefficient. In the first-order kinetics model there is a recovery
   of the dissolved-chemical concentration at the soil surface during the
   period between rainstorms. As a result, the initial concentration at the
   soil surface for the subsequent rainstorm is higher than that expected
   when equilibrium is assumed.}},

Abstract = {{We present an advective-dispersive solute transport model that
   explicitly accounts for multiple sources of nonequilibrium and
   transformation reactions during steady state flow in porous media. The
   multiprocess nonequilibrium with transformation (MPNET) model is
   formulated for cases where nonequilibrium, caused by a combination of
   transport-related and sorption-related processes, and abiotic/biotic
   transformations can be described as first-order processes. The impact of
   the coupling of nonequilibrium and transformation reactions on solute
   transport is examined using selected illustrative examples. The
   performance of the model is evaluated by comparing predictions obtained
   with the model, where values for all model parameters are obtained
   independently, to a data set obtained from the literature. The
   prediction obtained with the MPNET model matched the data very well,
   much better than did the predictions obtained with the MPNET model
   assuming no degradation and with a model that does not account for

Abstract = {{When measurement error (ME) is present, the true value of the annual
   maximum discharge and of the censoring threshold discharge is unknown.
   The impact of using estimated rather than true discharges on the
   inference of flood quantiles is considered. The likelihood function is
   formulated for data which consist of annual maximum discharges
   (systematic data) and occurrences of floods above some threshold
   discharge (binomial-censored data). The formulation makes explicit
   allowance for the corruption of discharges by statistically independent
   ME. This formulation can be used to get maximum likelihood estimates or
   perform a Bayesian analysis. A limited sampling experiment was conducted
   to assess the performance of two-parameter lognormal maximum likelihood
   quantile estimators in the presence of simple uncorrelated discontinuous
   ME. It was found that ME reduces the information content of systematic
   and binomial-censored data with the reduction being greatest for
   distributions with low coefficients of variation. When only using
   systematic data it was found that the performance of estimators making
   allowance for ME was, at best, only modestly better than that of
   estimators ignoring ME. The principal finding, however, was that the
   performance of maximum likelihood estimators using binomial-censored
   data but ignoring ME can be substantially worse than that of estimators
   making explicit allowance for ME. In fact, the loss in performance can
   be so great that in some cases, it may be preferable to ignore the
   binomial-censored data. Finally, it is shown that a Bayesian analysis of
   flood data affected by ME provides insights not offered by maximum
   likelihood estimation. When the threshold discharge is in error, the
   posterior distribution of the lognormal parameters can become bimodal as
   the length of the binomial-censored record increases, indicating an
   inconsistency between the information in the systematic and
   binomial-censored data.}},

Abstract = {{The flow of water through a porous medium is simulated numerically using
   a cubic network of cylindrical capillary tubes as the conceptual model
   of the medium. Poiseuille's law is used to relate the viscous
   dissipation within the fluid to the pressure gradient driving the flow.
   The pore size distribution is determined from the capillary pressure
   function of the medium, and the tubes are randomly arranged within the
   network. A critical pore radius is identified as the limiting pore size
   which contributes to the permeability structure of the medium. When only
   tubes from that part of the pore size distribution above this critical
   radius are used to form the network, the permeability of the network
   equals the measured permeability of the medium. This parameter, the
   critical pore radius, links the permeability to the pore size
   distribution and gives insight into the topological structure of the

Abstract = {{A new methodology is proposed to estimate the actual direction of water
   flow in a fractured aquitard. According to the conceptual model, the
   flow direction in a fractured aquitard is dictated by the azimuth of the
   fractures, since almost no flow occurs within the rock matrix, which
   possesses very low hydraulic conductivity. Thus, while groundwater in
   reality continues to flow along the fractures, calculations based on
   water level data may incorrectly indicate changes in hydraulic gradients
   and azimuth of flow. The present methodology is based on simultaneous
   analysis of hydraulic gradients and flow direction, as calculated from
   equipotential surfaces. The approach was tested in a fractured chalky
   aquitard, and the calculated direction of principal fractures was found
   to be in good agreement with subsurface fracture data obtained from a
   tunnel excavated in the vicinity of the study area.}},

Abstract = {{The quasi-linear parameterization for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity
   K(PSI) = K(s) exp (alpha-PSI), where K is hydraulic conductivity, PSI is
   soil water matric potential, K(s) is saturated hydraulic conductivity,
   and alpha is a porous material parameter, has been used in both
   stochastic and deterministic models of unsaturated water flow in porous
   materials. In the stochastic approach, K(s) is assumed lognormally
   distributed, but alpha and the volumetric soil water capacity C =
   d-theta/d-PSI, with theta-volumetric soil water content, are assumed
   normally distributed. We point out here that alpha and K(s) are related
   to the same internal pore geometry of the soil. This interrelationship
   ensures that if K(s) is lognormal, then alpha, and possibly C, will also
   be lognormal. Additionally, we present preliminary field results which
   indicate that alpha is better described by a lognormal than a normal
   distribution. The quasi-linear parameterization can be expected to be
   correct only in some integral sense. Predictions of increases in the
   variability of hydraulic conductivity with decreasing PSI may therefore
   be prejudiced by the use of the exponential form for K(PSI). Tests of
   the sensitivity of stochastic model predictions to both the
   parameterizations adopted for K(PSI) and the assumed distribution
   functions of parameters seem warranted. Reliable experimental evidence
   on field variability of K(PSI) and PSI(theta) at substantial negative
   values of PSI are also needed.}},

Abstract = {{A waste load allocation process is developed to determine the maximum
   effluent concentration of a conservative substance that will not harm
   fish and wildlife propagation. If this concentration is not exceeded in
   the effluent, the acute toxicity criterion will not be violated in the
   receiving stream, and the chronic criterion will not be exceeded in the
   zone of passage, defined in many state water quality standards to allow
   the movement of aquatic organisms past a discharge. Considerable
   simplification of the concentration equation, which is the heart of any
   waste load allocation, is achieved because it is based on the
   concentration in the receiving stream when the concentration gradient on
   the zone of passage boundary is zero. Consequently, the expression
   obtained for effluent concentration is independent of source location or
   stream morphology. Only five independent variables, which are routinely
   available to regulatory agencies, are required to perform this
   allocation. It aids in developing permit limits which are protective
   without being unduly restrictive or requiring large expenditures of
   money and manpower on field investigations.}},

   predicts profile water content distribution under fallow and cropped
   conditions than the capacity-type approach (R2 = 0.80 and 0.83 versus R2
   = 0.59 and 0.70). When integrated over the growing season, drainage,
   evaporation and transpiration rates were very similar for capacity-type
   water movement and potential-driven water movement over the range of

Abstract = {{A new model for erosion of plane soil surfaces by water is developed
   using physical principles. Raindrop impact and overland flow remove soil
   from the original cohesive soil. Once eroded soil enters overland flow,
   either as aggregates or primary particles, a significant proportion of
   it returns to the soil bed, forming a cohesionless deposited layer from
   which it can be removed again by the same erosion processes. The action
   of the eroding agents will be divided between eroding the unshielded
   original cohesive soil and reintroducing sediment from the deposited
   layer. The theory recognizes that the nature of the surface is modified
   by the erosion and deposition processes affecting it. Solutions of the
   governing differential equations describing sediment concentration are
   developed for two distinct equilibrium cases. The first case, when the
   deposited layer completely shields the original soil, appears to
   correspond with what has been previously called a
   ``transport-limited{''} situation. The second case occurs when such
   shielding is incomplete, and sediment concentration is affected by the
   cohesive strength of the soil. The resulting equations for sediment
   concentration at equilibrium are compared with existing equations.
   Firstly, the equation for the case where the soil is lacking cohesion is
   shown to be similar to the semiempirical equation of Yang (1973).
   Secondly, when the soil is cohesive the slope length relationships are
   shown to be in good agreement with the universal soil loss equation over
   a wide range of slope steepness.}},

Abstract = {{The model of soil erosion on a plane slope introduced by Hairsine and
   Rose (this issue) is further developed by considering rill flow. The
   rills are considered to be parallel and incised in a homogeneous soil
   mass and have sediment and water flux contributed to them orthogonally.
   The erosive action of water flowing down these rills is described using
   the concept of stream power, which is assumed to be uniformly
   distributed around the wetted perimeter. The apportioning of the erosion
   and deposition processes within a rill is then considered to be
   influenced by the spatial extent of a deposited layer. The theory is
   developed for trapezoidal rills, with triangular rills and rectangular
   rills as special cases. Equations describing sediment continuity are
   presented, and numerical and analytical solutions are described for the
   entrainment-limited and transport-limited situations. The experiments of
   Meyer and Harmon (1985) are examined using this theory, and consistency
   of evaluated parameters is demonstrated within this data set.}},

Abstract = {{Models of unsteady unsaturated flow in large-scale heterogeneous soils
   are developed considering finite flow domains and nonstationarity of the
   soil properties and flow characteristics. The problem is cast into a
   more general stochastic framework than the originally proposed
   stationary spectral framework (Mantoglou and Gelhar, 1987a, b, c). The
   methodology considers the three dimensionality of the local governing
   flow equation, the nonlinear dependence of the local output on the local
   soil properties, as well as the effect of finite flow domains and
   nonstationarity of the soil properties and flow characteristics. The
   large-scale model representation is in the form of a partial
   differential equation, with large-scale ``effective{''} parameters,
   subject to a set of initial and boundary conditions. The effective model
   parameters are related to a set of fluctuation covariance equations
   obtained by using a linearized fluctuation equation. This set of
   covariance equations and the corresponding large-scale model of the
   system are coupled and must be solved simultaneously. Particular cases
   of interest where stationarity in two or three spatial dimensions occurs
   are investigated, and, using spectral representations, the
   dimensionality of the covariance equations is reduced. Simple
   closed-form and practical expressions for the effective parameters valid
   in specific situations are presented, and illustrative examples are
   discussed. The theory and the models presented provide a more complete
   view of the large-scale unsaturated flow problem and can prove useful
   for evaluation of unsaturated flow phenomena of paramount importance in
   practical applications, for example, for predicting the movement of
   liquid wastes in the unsaturated zone.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic unsaturated flow theory and a numerical simulation model
   have been coupled in order to estimate the large-scale mean behavior of
   an unsaturated flow system in a spatially variable soil. On the basis of
   the theoretical developments of Mantoglou and Gelhar (1987a, b, c), the
   theory assumes that the local hydraulic soil properties are realizations
   of three-dimensional random fields, and it derives the large-scale flow
   structure by averaging the local governing flow equation over the
   ensemble. The resulting mean model representation is in the form of a
   partial differential equation, similar to the local flow equation. in
   which effective model parameters occur (e.g., effective hydraulic
   conductivity). Further, the theory predicts the variance (prediction
   error) of the capillary tension head due to the spatial variability of
   the local hydraulic soil properties. The governing unsaturated flow
   equation representing the mean system behavior is solved using a finite
   difference numerical solution technique. The effective parameters are
   evaluated from the stochastic theory formulas before entering them into
   the numerical solution for each iteration. The stochastic model is
   applied to a field site in Denmark, where information is available on
   the spatial variability of soil parameters and variables. Numerical
   simulations have been carried out, and predictions of the mean behavior
   and the variance of the capillary tension head and the soil moisture
   content have been compared to field observations. The stochastic model
   predicts the average system behavior reasonably well. Reasonable results
   are also obtained for the range of variation of the capillary tension
   head, despite the limited number of measurements and corresponding
   statistical inference issues. The stochastic model presented here seems
   to offer a rational framework for modeling large-scale unsaturated flow
   and estimating areal averages of soil-hydrological processes in
   spatially variable soils.}},

Title = {{EVALUATION OF LIQUID AND VAPOR WATER-FLOW IN DESERT SOILS BASED ON CL-36

Abstract = {{The distribution of anthropogenic Cl-36 and H-3 was used along with
   numerical flow simulations to evaluate the relative importance of liquid
   and vapor flow in the shallow unsaturated zone of an area within the
   Chihuahuan Desert of Texas. Chlorine 36 is nonvolatile and is restricted
   to liquid phase flow, whereas tritiated water is volatile and can move
   in both liquid and vapor phases. Tritium penetrated 1 m deeper than
   Cl-36, although H-3 fallout occurred later than that of Cl-36. Deeper
   penetration of H-3 relative to that of Cl-36 was attributed to enhanced
   downward movement of H-3 in the vapor phase. The moisture flux
   calculated from the Cl-36/Cl peak at 0.5-m depth was 1.4 mm yr-1,
   whereas that based on the H-3 peak at 1.4-m depth was 7 mm yr-1. The
   difference in moisture fluxes between the two tracers suggests a vapor
   flux of approximately 6 mm yr-1. The vapor flux hypothesis was tested
   using nonisothermal liquid and vapor flow simulations with the computer
   code SPLaSH-WaTr. Simulations of 5-day periods in the winter and summer
   were conducted to represent the extremes in temperature gradients. The
   calculated vapor flux was two to eight orders of magnitude greater than
   the liquid flux for the periods simulated. Predicted vapor fluxes were
   upward in the top 0.04 m of the unsaturated zone in the summer and
   winter in response to steep water potential gradients induced by surface
   evaporation. Below the evaporation front. from depths of 0.15 to 1 m,
   downward vapor fluxes in the summer were much greater than generally
   upward vapor fluxes in the winter. These results suggest an annual net
   downward vapor flux that is consistent with the chemical tracer data.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the relation between the mean distance of movement
   during individual flood events and the mean particle size of
   unconstrained clasts in gravel bed rivers. Distance of movement was
   scaled using the mean distance of movement of the median size group of
   the surface material; size was scaled using the median b axis diameter
   of the subsurface material. The scaled data are fitted with a nonlinear
   function. Clasts larger than the median of surface material exhibit a
   steep decline of mobility, with an upper limit for mobility near
   D(i)/D50sub = 10. Smaller materials exhibit a less sensitive relation.
   We suppose that trapping of small clasts affects their travel distance.
   These results indicate that the movement of free surface stones is size
   preferred. A subordinate analysis of free, constrained and buried
   particles reveals that bed surface structure acts to reduce differential
   movement.}},
