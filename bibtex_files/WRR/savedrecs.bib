Abstract = {{Transferable discharge permit (TDP) programs for controlling several
   pollutants may manage such pollutants as several individual commodities
   or as a single weighted sum of the various pollutants.  This paper shows
   that the weighted sum permit program may be appropriate for managing
   pollutants that have an additive or a noninteractive effect on
   environmental quality.  However, under this approach, administrators do
   not have direct control over the amount of each pollutant that is
   discharged, and environmental quality may be jeopardized unless the
   selected weighting factors induce a market equilibrium that satisfies
   environmental quality standards for the region.  Estimates of the
   cost-effective weighting factors that would tend to satisfy
   environmental quality standards under such programs are developed here. 
   These estimates require complete water quality information and, in the
   case of noninteractive pollutants, treatment costs.  An approach is
   described for estimating the cost-effective weighting factors for
   noninteractive pollutants in cases where treatment cost information is
   unknown.  This approach is demonstrated for a weighted sum TDP program
   for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and phosphorus.  The results of this
   demonstration suggest that for weighted sum permits for these pollutants
   it is possible to determine a set of weighting factors that achieve
   adequate environmental protection, cost efficiency, and certainty of
   system outcome.}},

Abstract = {{Water distribution networks can fail either by the actual demand at one
   or more nodes exceeding the design demands, or by a pipe between two
   nodes failing.  The implications of each type of failure can be assessed
   by the shortfall in supply caused by a failure event together with the
   probability of occurrence of the event, and can be represented by the
   expected volume of deficit.  Converting the implications of the two
   failure types into these commensurate units permits them to be added
   directly to give a single consistent measure of reliability.  The
   assessment of shortfall for the pipe failure mode is derived from the
   observation that when a pipe breaks, a section of pipe must be isolated
   by valves to permit the repair to be made.  Isolating the pipe also
   isolates the customers who withdraw water from that section of pipe. 
   Thus the shortfall in supply in this case is based on the amount of
   supply (number of customers) cut off by isolating the pipe for repair. 
   The measure extends previous reliability parameters by recognizing that
   in reality demand occurs along links rather than being concentrated
   solely at nodes at the ends of the links which is the normal assumption
   for both simulation and optimization models.  If reliability of the
   network is found to be unsatisfactory, it can be improved in two ways. 
   One is to increase the design demand at nodes so that the probability of
   actual demand's exceeding the design value is reduced.  The other is to
   add more valves so that the length of pipe which has to be isolated in
   order to repair a pipe is reduced, thereby, reducing the number of
   customers who must have their supply cut off during a repair.  Use of
   the two methods to determine and, if necessary, to improve reliability
   is demonstrated by their application to an example network.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the relation between the structure of river networks
   and the features of their geomorphologic hydrologic response.  A
   mathematical formulation of connectivity of a drainage network is
   proposed to relate contributing areas and the network geometry.  In view
   of the connectivity conjecture, Horton's bifurcation ratio R(B) tends,
   for high values of Strahler's order OMEGA of the basin, to the area
   ratio R(A), and Horton's length ratio R(L) equals, in the limit, the
   single-order contributing area ratio R(a).  The relevance of these
   arguments is examined by reference to data from real basins.  Well-known
   empirical results from the geomorphological literature (Melton's law,
   Hack's relation, Moon's conjecture) are viewed as a consequence of
   connectivity.  It is found that in Hortonian networks the time evolution
   of contributing areas exhibits a multifractal behavior generated by a
   multiplicative process of parameter 1/R(B).  The application of the
   method of the most probable distribution in view of connectivity
   contributes new inroads toward a general formulation of the
   geomorphologic unit hydrograph, in particular generalizing its width
   function formulation.  A quantitative example of multifractal hydrologic
   response of idealized networks based on Peano's construct (for which
   R(B) = R(A) = 4, R(L) = 2) closes the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticide leaching was simulated numerically assuming Freundlich
   adsorption, first-order transformation and passive plant uptake, taking
   transient flow, hydrodynamic dispersion, and depth as well as
   temperature dependence of (bio)chemical parameters into account.  The
   dependency of the leached fraction on sorption and transformation
   parameters appeared to be in good general agreement with the model
   developed by Jury et al. (1987).  We incorporated spatial variability of
   (bio)chemical parameters into the piston flow model and showed how
   spatial variability may be accounted for without having to resort to
   demanding Monte Carlo techniques.  Such spatial variability affects the
   leached fraction significantly.  The data requirement of the simple
   stochastic model is small and the versatility relatively high.  For
   parameter values often not of prime practical interest for pesticide
   screening this model fails.  Considering transport by convection and
   dispersion in the semi-infinite domain, this spatial variability can be
   easily accounted for using parameter ranges for which our original
   analytical model for spatially variable piston transport failed.  In
   this revised model, hydrodynamic dispersion, preferential flow, and
   spatial variability of transformation, sorption and soil thickness are
   dealt with in a similar fashion, while both correlation or the absence
   of correlation of parameters can be incorporated through an
   approximation of apparent residence time variance.}},

Abstract = {{A 3.8-ha watershed on the west coast of New Zealand was instrumented
   with suction lysimeters and automatic water samplers to determine the
   relationship between subsurface isotopic and chemical concentrations to
   those of rainfall and resulting streamflow. A t test showed that +/- 2
   parts per thousand represented a significant difference between
   successive sample deuterium values. Eleven rainfall episodes were
   subdivided into two categories: (1) two events where stream isotopic
   composition did not deflect > 2 parts per thousand from prestorm values,
   and (2) four events which demonstrated new water flushing. Detailed
   analysis of one 47-mm rainfall (9.8-mm runoff) event showed that old
   water dominated streamwater exiting the watershed by 90\% using a
   standard two-component hydrograph separation for deuterium (corroborated
   by Cl and electrical conductivity). Three-component hydrograph
   separation indicated that 12-16\% was in the form of soil water, with <
   5\% as on-channel precipitation and 80\% groundwater. Analysis of over
   1000 water samples revealed systematic trends in soil water and
   groundwater isotopic composition both in a downslope and downprofile
   direction. Between-storm suction lysimeter deuterium data showed a
   systematic dampened response to temporally variable rainfall deuterium
   concentrations. Multivariate cluster analysis revealed three distinct
   soil water/groundwater groupings, with respect to soil depth and
   geographic position within the watershed. Within-storm suction lysimeter
   sampling preserved similar groupings, indicating that the subsurface
   reservoir is poorly mixed on short time scales. Understanding subsurface
   mixing response to rainfall should greatly improve models of episodic
   stream response and partitioning of storm flow into waters of different
   age.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and demonstration of a
   two-dimensional finite-element hydrogeochemical transport model,
   HYDROGEOCHEM, for simulating transport of reactive multispecies solutes.
   The model is designed for application to heterogeneous, anisotropic,
   saturated-unsaturated media under transient or steady state flow
   conditions.  It simulates the chemical processes of complexation,
   dissolution-precipitation, adsorption-desorption, ion exchange, redox,
   and acid-base reaction, simultaneously.  A set of four example problems
   are presented.  The examples illustrate the model's ability to simulate
   a variety of reactive transport problems.  Important results presented
   include a depiction of the propagation of multiple
   precipitation-dissolution fronts, a display of the large errors in model
   response if the number of iterations between the hydrologic transport
   and chemical equilibrium modules is limited to one, an illustration of
   the development of greater concentration of contaminants in groundwater
   away from a waste site than near the source, and a demonstration of the
   variation in distribution coefficients of more than 6 orders of

Abstract = {{A variable-aperture channel model is used as the basis to interpret data
   from a 3-year tracer transport experiment in fractured rocks.  The data
   come from the so-called Stripa-3D experiment performed by Neretnieks and
   coworkers.  Within the framework of the variable-aperture channel
   conceptual model, tracers are envisioned as traveling along a number of
   variable-aperture flow channels, whose properties are related to the
   mean bBAR and standard deviation sigma of the fracture aperture
   distribution.  Two methods are developed to address the presence of
   strong time variation of the tracer injection flow rate in this
   experiment.  The first approximates the early part of the injection
   history by an exponential decay function and is applicable to the early
   time tracer breakthrough data.  The second is a deconvolution method
   involving the use of Toeplitz matrices and is applicable over the
   complete period of variable injection of the tracers.  Both methods give
   consistent results.  These results include not only estimates of bBAR
   and sigma, but also the number of channels involved in the tracer
   transport and their Peclet numbers and dispersivities.  An interesting
   and surprising observation is that the data indicate that for each
   channel the Peclet number increases with the mean travel time; i.e.,
   dispersivity decreases with mean travel time.  The meaning of this trend
   is discussed in terms of the strong heterogeneity of the flow system.}},

Abstract = {{Massively parallel computers will play an increasingly dominant role in
   hydrological computing.  One such computer is the Connection Machine
   model CM-2, a single-instruction stream, multiple-data stream computer
   with up to 65,536 processors, as much as 8 gigabytes (Gbyte) of random
   access memory distributed among the processors, and a FORTRAN compiler
   based on the proposed FORTRAN-90 standard.  One-, two-, and
   three-dimensional examples from hydrology are used in this paper to
   present a tutorial on programming for the CM-2.  The problem of
   saturated, steady flow in a randomly heterogeneous three-dimensional
   porous medium is explored here in some detail.  A diagonally
   preconditioned conjugate gradient (DPCG) iterative solver is applied to
   this problem for up to 128(3) nodes.  Less than 1 min of CM-2 time is
   required to reduce the error by a factor of 10(-6) for a 128 x 128 x 128
   grid with heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity.  Measured CPU times for
   the DPCG method are significantly smaller than those reported in the
   literature for a polynomial PCG solver applied to the same domain with
   different boundary conditions and executed on a Cray X-MP/48 and an
   Alliant FX/8.  The measured performance is also much greater than that
   reported in the literature for a strongly implicit procedure solver
   applied to a similar problem on a Cray 2.  The need for continued
   development of massively parallel algorithms, including effective
   iterative solution of linear systems of equations and problems with
   irregular domains, is indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Uniform flood frequency guidelines in the United States currently
   recommend fitting a Pearson (P3) distribution to the logarithms of
   annual maximum flood flows.  As a result, a plethora of procedures have
   been recommended for obtaining unbiased plotting positions and unbiased
   estimates of the skew coefficient and for inverting the cumulative
   distribution function of a P3 variate.  These developments are precisely
   the ingredients required for the construction of P3 probability plots. 
   Using Monte Carlo simulation, we develop a probability plot correlation
   coefficient (PPCC) hypothesis test for the P3 distribution.  Power
   studies are performed to evaluate the ability of the test to
   discriminate among competing distributional alternatives and to enhance
   our understanding of why the P3 distribution often appears to provide
   such a good fit to observed flood flow data.  A new estimator of the
   skew coefficient is presented which, unlike the biased and unbiased
   moment estimators, is unbounded and has significantly lower root mean
   square error than the moment estimators for highly skewed samples.}},

Abstract = {{A law for dispersion in fracture networks below the representative
   elementary volume (REV) is established by analyzing random walks in
   two-dimensional fracture networks in conjunction with percolation
   theory.  Irregular fracture networks near the percolation threshold were
   obtained by removing some of the fractures of a regular orthogonal
   network, consisting of fractures of equal length and different
   apertures, drawn randomly from a lognormal distribution.  The random
   walk was directed by an exact solution of flow through the network, and
   Monte Carlo simulations were performed to track particles through the
   fracture system.  The percolation theory analysis indicates a
   proportionality between the mean square displacement and time raised to
   the power 1.27, in excellent agreement with the simulations in the
   fracture networks, which indicate a proportionality with time raised to
   the power 1.3.}},

Abstract = {{Water in porous media near the Earth's surface is subject to large
   fluctuations in pore water pressure and temperature, often causing
   significant changes in the degree of saturation.  Quantitative
   comparisons of isothermal versus isobaric water retention are necessary
   to accurately predict changes in saturation due to the coupled influence
   of changes in the pore water matric potential psi and temperature T. 
   Yet there is a lack of experimental measurements of isobaric (i.e.,
   constant psi) water retention, inhibiting comparisons between isobaric
   and isothermal processes.  In the present study the influence of the
   chronological sequence of changes in psi and T is examined to determine
   whether the volumetric water content theta for any given final psi-T
   condition is independent of the psi-T sequence, when theta changes
   monotonically.  To obtain the necessary data for these comparisons,
   isothermal water retention experiments were performed over a range in
   psi from 0 to - 100 kPa, and isobaric water retention experiments were
   performed at 20-degrees and 80-degrees-C on core samples of a sandy soil
   and a nonwelded tuff.  Results provide further evidence that the effect
   of T on psi is considerably greater than estimates based on pore water
   capillary theory.  For these materials the thermal enhancement of psi
   was 4-12 times greater than capillary theory would predict.  The effect
   of T on theta during isobaric water retention was several times greater
   for drying (warming) conditions than for wetting (cooling) conditions at
   a given psi, resulting in net losses in theta ranging from 3 to 30\%. 
   For a given final psi at 80-degrees-C, virtually identical theta values
   were obtained regardless of the chronological sequence of isothermal and
   isobaric drainage paths for both materials.  This confirms the validity
   of unique theta (psi, T) surfaces describing monotonic changes in theta
   as functions of both psi and T in nonswelling porous materials. 
   Determination of these theta (psi, T) response surfaces for drying and
   wetting should yield water retention envelopes, useful in modeling water
   retention in near-surface environments where both psi and T vary.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an attempt at deterministically modeling spatially
   distributed snowmelt in an alpine catchment.  The basin is 9.4 km2 in
   area and elevations range from 1900 to 3050 m above sea level.  The
   model makes use of digital terrain data with 25 m grid spacing.  Energy
   balance components are calculated for each grid element taking
   topographic variations of solar radiation into account.  For each grid
   element albedo and snow surface temperatures are simulated.  Model
   performance is evaluated on the basis of snow cover depletion patterns
   as derived from weekly air photographs.  The use of spatially
   distributed data allows for addressing individual model components. 
   Results indicate that the basic model assumptions are realistic.  Model
   inadequacies are shown to arise from processes not included in the model
   such as avalanching and long wave emission from surrounding terrain as
   well as inaccurate model parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed grid-based model is used (1) to analyze the importance of
   selected model parameters, (2) to simulate spatial distributions of snow
   cover properties in a small basin and (3) for a comparison with less
   sophisticated models as typically used in operational applications. 
   Results indicate that variations of water equivalent with slope and
   local relief are of utmost importance for realistic distributed
   simulations but more moderately influence mean basin melt.  Snow cover
   variables of which spatial distributions are simulated include the
   thermal and hydraulic state of the pack and hourly melt water release. 
   All variables exhibit substantial variations in space and time.  They
   are primarily controlled by topography and the delay of melt water in
   deep packs.  The grid model is compared with a snow band model and a
   parametric model.  The latter estimates the snowpack's areal extent from
   water equivalent.  Simulated snow-covered areas suggest the grid model
   to be the most realistic.  Differences in terms of mean basin melt
   derive from different assumptions associated with model structure.}},

Abstract = {{The use of soil venting or vacuum extraction for remediation of
   contaminated soil has lead to an increased interest in modeling
   gas-phase processes.  The majority of existing transport models have
   been developed assuming homogeneous porous media properties.  It is well
   known, however, that the assumption of homogeneity will almost always be
   invalid for field systems.  In addition, sorption has been described
   using the local equilibrium assumption.  This assumption has also been
   shown to be invalid under certain conditions.  A one-dimensional model
   is presented that accounts for a structured or heterogeneous porous
   medium and for rate-limited sorption.  The model is designed for cases
   where transport occurs by advection and dispersion in the gas phase and
   where the liquid phase is immobile.  A sensitivity analysis is
   presented, and parameter determination is discussed.  The performance of
   the model was evaluated by comparing predicted simulations to data
   obtained from the literature.  The model performed well, especially
   considering that the values for all input parameters were obtained
   independent of curve fitting.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Artesian Basin (GAB), Australia, contains several groundwater
   types within the Lower Cretaceous-Jurassic confined aquifer system with
   distinctly different chemistry.  The groundwater flow pattern of the GAB
   has been analyzed with over 40 Cl-36 measurements from this study and
   that of Bentley et al. (1986a).  The results indicate general agreement
   between the hydrologic model ages (Darcy's law) and the radioisotopic
   model ages suggesting that flow conditions over approximately 1 m.y.
   have remained largely unchanged.  The results confirm that the
   chemically distinct western GAB operates as a separate flow system with
   its own recharge area and its own geochemical evolution.  The results
   indicate an area of groundwater with relatively young Cl-36 ages in the
   central portion of the basin which cannot be explained by flow or mixing
   along the presently known flow lines.  It is hypothesized that an
   additional source of young water originated from the basin margin region
   to the north and northwest between the Simpson Desert and Mount Isa. 
   This additional recharge area, active more strongly over the last 500
   kyr than at present, is delineated by Cl-36 ages which integrate a
   history and evolution over the age of the groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{When compressible fluid continuity in a fluid-saturated compressible
   porous medium under transient conditions is considered, we cannot obtain
   a standard linear diffusion equation in terms of pressure unless we
   ignore the quadratic terms in the pressure gradient expression, for
   example {[}partial-derivative-p/partial-derivative-r]2 for cylindrical
   plane strain coordinates.  They are assumed to be so small that their
   contribution can be ignored in pressure analysis.  Thereby, a nonlinear
   equation can be avoided.  During hydraulic fracturing, rapid drawdown,
   or slug testing, the pressure difference can reach a high value
   ``instantly.{''}  An extremely steep pressure gradient is generated, and
   it may not be appropriate to neglect quadratic terms.  In this paper, an
   analytical solution for pore pressure coupling with the deformation in a
   porous medium is developed by taking the quadratic term into account. 
   By Laplace transformation, we obtain a solution for a nonlinear
   diffusion equation by setting up a fluid continuity equation according
   to the mass conservation law rather than from energy principles in terms
   of volume.  Deviations from existing solutions are identified in cases
   of high pressure gradients, and these deviations are related to the
   compressibility of the pore and injected fluids.  It would seem that the
   new solution gives a more correct early time response in these cases. 
   To calculate the effective stresses and pore pressure, we need to
   carefully define hydraulic diffusivity.  We have related the
   coefficients of Biot and Geertsma to those of mass conservation, which
   are commonly used in hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{When fluid passes into or out of an aquifer, work is done at the
   boundaries which is used partly to change the internal energy of the
   system and partly to overcome resistance to flow.  For a saturated
   medium, the change in internal energy is further partitioned into two
   terms, the strain energy stored in the elastic soil matrix and the
   strain energy stored in the pore water due to compression.  A technique
   is developed in this paper which interprets the dynamic behavior of an
   aquifer in terms of its energy transformations.  The central feature of
   this approach is the quantification of the physical processes into
   individual energy and work parameters which together characterize the
   response of an entire aquifer to a given set of excitations.  By this
   means, the rate of change of strain energy is shown to be a natural
   index of the unsteadiness of a system, an insight which leads to an
   adaptive algorithm for adjusting the time step of a transient
   groundwater flow model.  Further, the energy approach is used to assess
   differential compaction in a heterogeneous aquifer, thereby providing a
   basis for efficient computation and for rational acquisition of
   compressibility data.}},

Abstract = {{Many fluvially eroded terrains display an intimate interaction of their
   patterns of channel and ridge lines.  Under the assumption that there is
   exactly one outer ridge link positioned between any two neighboring
   outer channel links, the paper analyzes such interlocking networks by
   investigating their dual graphs.  Several formal relationships are
   established which translate into a set of both existing and new theorems
   describing the close interdependency of channel and ridge parameters: 
   Interlocking networks are of equal magnitude, the link numbers of the
   ridge and channel paths enclosing channel and ridge subnetworks have the
   same mean value, the link number of the boundary path enclosing a
   subnetwork is equal to the number of boundary paths passing through the
   root of the subnetwork, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between
   the inner nodes of the two networks as well as between their paths, and
   every such pair of corresponding ridge and channel paths delineates an
   area that is closed with regard to slope runoff.}},

   fields deal with the motion of indivisible ``solute particles{''}
   through such fields, whereas Eulerian methods treat the solute
   concentration, C, as the dependent variable in a stochastic mass balance
   equation. Both approaches lead to nonlinear stochastic differential
   equations which are difficult to solve analytically without
   approximation. A particular Eulerian approximation which has become
   popular in recent years derives from the premise that, in mildly
   fluctuating velocity fields, terms involving the products of fluctuating
   quantities can be disregarded in comparison to terms which involve only
   one such quantity. This leads to a non-Fickian low-order approximation
   for the ensemble mean concentration <C>, where the dispersive flux is
   not proportional to NABLA<C>, but is given instead by a convolution
   integral. The spatial moments of <C> based on this approximation are
   shown to be in conflict with those obtained from a first-order
   Lagrangian analysis. We explore this apparent contradiction and conclude
   that the reason lies in the nonasymptotic nature of the Eulerian
   approximation whereby terms neglected are of the same order as terms
   retained.}},

Abstract = {{Specified head and/or specified flux are typically employed as boundary
   conditions in numerical simulations involving unsaturated flow.  Some
   modelers incorrectly refer to a specified flux condition as a
   second-type boundary.  In the mathematical literature a second-type
   boundary is defined as a boundary along which the gradient of the
   dependent variable is specified.  This note identifies physical
   scenarios in which a second-type boundary (specified gradient) may be
   the most appropriate boundary condition, discusses a procedure for
   implementing a specified gradient boundary condition in a flow code, and
   presents an application of the procedure in the simulation of two
   practical problems.}},

Abstract = {{Broadbridge et al. (1988) studied constant rainfall infiltration into

   Z{*} of R(crit)/K1.K1 is saturated hydraulic conductivity and R(crit) is
   the critical rainfall rate for which surface ponding and profile base
   saturation occur simultaneously.  They found for the linear soil that
   for lim(Z{*}) --> 0 R(crit)/K1 almost-equal-to 2.004.  The correct value
   is in fact exactly 2.  In the present work a shallow profile flow
   equation is established and used (1) to prove this results holds exactly
   for soils with moisture diffusivity D and hydraulic conductivity K
   quasi-linearly connected but otherwise arbitrary functions of volumetric
   moisture content theta; and (2) to develop a physical argument
   indicating the result is exact in the fully general case with D(theta)

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{A 500-m2 watershed on a deposit of coal refuse was instrumented for
   measurements of runoff and sediment yield and monitored for 15 months.
   The range of 42 storm period sediment yields was greater for the
   watershed as a whole (16 to 3,480 g m-2) than for a 4.66-m2 portion of
   interfluve surface (15 to 1,596 g m-2). The ratio of sediment yield
   values (watershed:interfluve) was not constant. Ratios of about 7:1
   occurred in late spring, when gully floors were flushed of colluvium
   that had accumulated during winter. The ratio remained above 2:1 in
   summer, when intense runoff caused gully incision. Estimates of annual
   sediment yield from three reaches of gully (82 to 160 kg m-2 yr-1) are
   about an order of magnitude greater than an estimate for interfluves (12
   kg m-2 yr-1). A correlation analysis indicated that 78\% of the observed
   variance in watershed sediment yield values is associated with
   characteristics of storm rainfall and runoff.}},

Abstract = {{Permeameter experiments were conducted to determine, the permeability
   response of a clay-bearing and to changes in fluid composition. These
   experiments examined the effects of varying cation type and
   concentration using NaCl and CaCl2 solutions, as well as the effects of
   freshwater flushing of sediments equilibrated with seawater and large
   versus small stepwise reductions in NaCl concentration. The major goal
   of the study was to correlate permeability with measured parameters of
   the pore microstructure. Sediment samples from the tests were analyzed
   using Brunauer, Emmett, Teller (BET) and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether
   (EGME) adsorption methods to determine specific surface area. Other
   samples were examined using scanning electron microscopy and digital
   image analysis methods. For image analysis, backscattered electron
   images were acquired and specific measurements of pore structure
   parameters (porosity, pore-size distribution) were made. Stepwise
   multiple regression was used to construct an empirical model of
   permeability, which included terms of porosity, mean pore diameter, and
   specific surface area. The Kozeny-Carman model was applied to the data
   and led to predicted permeabilities 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower
   than measured values. This was attributed to the presence of dead-end
   pores and the importance of flow through large conducting channels.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops a methodology for deriving the spatial and temporal
   moments of tracer concentration in disordered geological formations and
   suggests a geostatistical formalism for interpolation and prediction of
   concentration, conditional to concentration measurements. The required
   spatial and temporal moments of the concentration are obtained by a
   biparticle tracking scheme which yields the bivariate probability
   distribution function of particle displacements in terms of the input
   log conductivity random field and the prevailing flow conditions. The
   structure of the moments of the concentration is discussed, and we show
   that (1) the concentration correlation function is anisotropic,
   nonstationary and nonsymmetrical; (2) there is a larger correlation
   between concentrations along the mean flow direction than normal to it;
   (3) the correlation between the concentration at any two points with
   fixed coordinates on a moving (Lagrangian) coordinate system increases
   with travel time; (4) the correlation function necessarily assumes
   negative values beyond a certain threshold distance; and (5) the
   concentration variance is finite even when neglecting pore-scale
   dispersion. Application of the geostatistical prediction algorithm using
   the concentration spatial/temporal moments shows a good potential for
   reducing prediction uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Historical data for large streams in the Catskill Mountains indicate
   that acidic deposition has significantly influenced water quality, but
   that this effect is most observable in early (pre-1945) data, and
   consists primarily of increased base cation (CaMg) concentrations. More
   recent data suggest that landscape disturbance currently exerts a
   stronger influence on acid/base status of large streams than does acidic
   deposition, resulting in increases in both CaMg and acid-neutralizing
   capacity (ANC). Estimates of SO42- concentration indicate that SO42- is
   a conservative ion in the Catskills, and stream water concentrations
   have decreased since reaching maximum values around 1970, consistent
   with temporal trends in emissions and deposition in the northeastern
   United States. Nitrate concentrations, on the other hand, have increased
   substantially in all but one stream in the past two decades, independent
   of any change in nitrogen deposition in the region; changes in the
   capacity of watersheds to retain nitrogen are hypothesized as causes of
   increased stream water NO3-. In small, undisturbed streams, increases in
   NO3- and decreases in CaMg appear to offset the effects of reduced
   SO42-, and lead to decreasing trends in ANC.}},

Abstract = {{We explored methods for extrapolating mainstream channel lengths of
   first-order drainage basins from synoptic data to characterize them for
   numerical watershed modeling. We analyzed four catchments in a
   climatologically semiarid and geologically homogeneous region east of
   the Cascade Mountains in Washington state. Within each of these
   catchments, we identified stream channel networks manually from
   1:24,000-scale topographic maps, and from 50-m resolution digital
   elevation models using commercially available drainage network
   extraction methods. A least squares fit of logarithms of mainstream
   length plotted against basin area established a regression relation to
   use for predicting mainstream lengths in the smallest subbasins. To test
   our relation, we compared predicted mainstream lengths with first-,
   second- and third-order channel lengths measured from low-altitude
   aerial photographs of a representative fourth-order basin. Our results
   indicate that relations of mainstream length to basin area derived from
   coarsely gridded data (e.g., 30 m) cannot be used to characterize stream
   and basin morphometry in the smallest basins due to the presence of
   hydrologic and geometric controls (i.e., thresholds) that limit the
   mainstream channel length and total basin length in first-, second-, and
   third-order basins. The presence of these thresholds potentially
   constrains the range over which theoretically self-similar, or fractal,
   relationships can be applied to stream-channel networks.}},

Abstract = {{In order to obtain a good description of the exceedances in a partial
   duration series it is often necessary to divide the year into a number
   (2-4) of seasons. Hereby a stationary exceedance distribution can be
   maintained within each season. This type of seasonal models may,
   however, not be suitable for prediction purposes due to the large number
   of parameters required. In the particular case with exponentially
   distributed exceedances and Poissonian occurrence times the precision of
   the T year event estimator has been thoroughly examined considering both
   seasonal and nonseasonal models. The two-seasonal probability density
   function of the T year event estimator has been deduced and used in the
   assessment of the precision of approximate moments. The nonseasonal
   approach covered both a total omission of seasonality by pooling data
   from different flood seasons and a discarding of nonsignificant
   season(s) before the analysis of extremes. Mean square error
   approximations (bias second order, variance first and second order) were
   employed as measures for prediction uncertainly. It was found that
   optimal estimates can usually be obtained with a nonseasonal approach.}},

Abstract = {{Response functions for drawdown, velocity, storage losses, and capture
   describe the spatial and temporal reaction of an aquifer to a unit
   pumping stress. This paper extends the use of response functions to the
   notion of capture for multilayered aquifer systems. Capture describes
   the pumping-induced quantity of water gained by the aquifer from
   internal or boundary sources. Internal sources include rivers and
   hydraulically connected aquifers. Boundary sources include constant head
   and head-dependent boundaries. Although response functions are defined
   only for linear systems, a methodology is demonstrated for implementing
   response functions in cases of nonlinear capture. The value of response
   functions lies in their utility as hydrologic constraints in management
   optimization models. An example demonstrates the use of separable
   programming to determine the nonlinear effects of drawdown below the
   bottom of a streambed.}},

Abstract = {{Land subsidence at Ravenna is the result of aquitard and reservoir
   compaction caused, respectively, by extensive groundwater withdrawals
   from the unconsolidated Quaternary basin and gas production from a
   number of pre-Quaternary pools scattered over the area. Water pumpage
   paralleled the postwar industrial development of Ravenna until the
   middle seventies when consumption was drastically curtailed owing to the
   economic crisis and the activation of a new aqueduct. Gas production
   started in 1952. The exploitation of several reservoirs is currently
   under way and the search for new fields is still in progress. Geodetic
   records indicate that the maximum cumulative subsidence over the period
   1950-1986, including a natural geologic settlement of perhaps 2 mm/yr,
   has been 1.30 m in the industrial zone of Ravenna. In 1980 the
   municipality promoted a reconnaissance study with the primary aim of
   providing the information base needed to reconstruct the actual
   occurrence, understand correctly the physical behavior and produce the
   essential input data to a mathematical model which realistically relates
   the subsidence of the city to groundwater withdrawal and gas removal
   with an emphasis on their respective influences. The results from the
   three-dimensional numerical simulations, performed with the aid of mixed
   finite element, finite difference and integral models, show that the
   primary responsibility for the regional land sinking should be placed on
   the subsurface water overdraft which occurred until the middle 1970s.
   Gas withdrawal plays a role restricted to the area overlying each
   reservoir with a magnitude depending on the depth of burial, thickness
   of mineralized rocks and overall volumetric production. A major
   environmental impact may be expected where the gas subsidence bowl is
   intersected by the Adriatic coastline.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic pattern of soil water transport is a major factor in
   determining the chemistry of streamwater. In the acidified Birkenes
   catchment (southernmost Norway) the streamwater chemistry is, to a first
   approximation, explained by mixing solutions from the forest floor, the
   B horizon and the deep peat, in various proportions depending on the
   hydrological conditions. Paradoxically, a direct physical contact
   between the forest floor and the B horizon on the one hand and the
   stream on the other is lacking, as the stream banks largely consist of
   peats. To investigate this paradox, soils and their levels of
   exchangeable cations were studied in a 100 m x 100 m grid. Results
   indicate that the exchange sites of the surface peat along the stream
   are significantly enriched in Al, probably due to return flow of Al-rich
   B horizon water. This view is supported by the similarity of the
   solution chemistry in surface peats and B horizons. Exchangeable base
   cations dominate in the forest floor upslope. Forest floor solutions, an
   important component of streamwater during intensive storms, are depleted
   in Al and may bypass the Al-enriched surface peats via ephemeral flow
   channels. A parallel study in a pristine catchment in mid-Norway shows a
   similar accumulation of Al in return flow areas. This indicates that
   acid deposition is not a prerequisite for elevated levels of
   exchangeable Al in the surface organic layers of return flow areas.}},

Abstract = {{Available nitrogen loading models, commonly used to estimate subsurface
   fluxes of dissolved nitrogen to coastal waters, have not been
   quantitatively or systematically compared; nor have they generally been
   field-verified at regional scales. We employed three published loading
   models, a site-specific model based upon water use data, and both
   Darcian and non-Darcian field approaches to obtain estimates of steady
   state, dissolved nitrogen flux through a permeable Massachusetts
   watershed. The two field approaches, based on independent data, yielded
   similar results. Results of the published loading models agreed closely
   with each other, but exceeded the mean of the field approaches (130 +/-
   12 mol N m-1 aquifer width yr-1) by 60\%, on average. The Water Use
   loading model agreed closely with the field results (within 4\%),
   largely because it did not require estimates of occupancy rate, which
   was found to be the major source of error to the published models. The
   observed, median concentration of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in
   groundwater increased from 1.9 to 313-mu-M during transport through the
   subbasin, confirming loading model predictions that > 99\% of the TDN
   flux is anthropogenic. In contrast to the watershed inputs, downgradient
   TDN was dominantly nitrate (98\%), indicating near-complete
   nitrification during transport. Significant transverse horizontal and
   vertical variations were found in the groundwater TDN distribution at
   scales of meters and tenths of meters, respectively, consistent with a
   large number of discrete nitrogen sources at the ground surface, and low
   transverse macrodispersivities in the aquifer. Loading models, if
   properly verified by field measurements at the stream tube scale, hold
   promise for characterizing the effects of land use on subsurface
   nitrogen flux through coastal watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile fine sediment was caught in six screened pit traps installed in
   the bed of a cobble gravel channel. Sample periods lasted from several
   hours to several days, so the trapped material represents a good
   integration of the range of sizes in traction up to a limit near 10 mm
   imposed by the screens. All the traps, distributed along a bar, caught
   similar amounts of material, of similar texture. The peak transport rate
   for the < 2-mm fraction, corresponding with the lower portion of the
   bimodal bed material, was about 3 x 10(-4) kg s-1 m-1. Observations
   continued for 6 weeks, through the nival flood on the stream. There was
   a sensible threshold for motion of material of all sizes, but minor

   conventionally classified ``wash{''} material, moved with near equal

Abstract = {{Major solute concentrations were measured for 123 individual rainstorms
   greater than 1 mm that occurred over a continuous 18-month period
   (September 1983 through February 1985) in the central Amazon Basin. The
   sum of concentrations was low (volume-weighted mean, 39-mu-eq/L), mean
   pH was 4.9, and the dominant source of acidity was organic acids.
   Analyses of interactions among solute concentrations in storms of
   differing size, frequency, and season of occurrence permitted evaluation
   of how rainfall variation affects depositional rates of solutes. The
   20\% of least frequent, large-volume storms accounted for about 75\% of
   the water and almost 60\% of the solutes deposited annually.
   Depositional rates of total N and P, Na+, and SO42- did not differ
   substantially as rainfall varied, while Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, NO3- and PO43-
   did. Wet deposition of N and P varied less than 20\%, despite a
   threefold intraannual variation of rainfall. Comparison between event
   and bulk precipitation samples indicated that dry deposition was minor
   except for P. Ionic ratios relative to Na+, R mode and Q mode factor
   analyses of rainwater composition, and differences in deposition among
   seasons provide evidence for the seasonal-scale importance of biogenic
   emissions of aerosols and reduced S and N gases from the Amazon rain
   forest to the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{A central Iowa glacial till soil under no-tillage condition was studied
   for its spatial behavior of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) at the
   surface soil layers. Hydraulic conductivity measurements both in situ
   and in the laboratory were made at two depths of 15 and 30 cm at regular
   intervals of 4.6 m on two perpendicular transects crossing each other at
   the center of the field. Simplified split-window median polishing in
   conjunction with a robust semivariogram estimator were used to examine
   the spatial structure of the glacial till material. Results of this
   study indicated a nested structure of K at 30 cm depth. Soil clustering
   at the experimental site at intervals of 20 m, in addition to the soil
   microheterogeneity, contributed to variation in K, with an overall range
   of spatial dependence of K up to 60 m. Medians of split windows of 23 m
   width were found to be the ``solo representatives{''} or ``summary
   points{''} of the soil clusters contributing to spatial structure. In
   situ and laboratory measurements for K showed consistency in their
   trends even though some parametric variations were observed. K values
   observed near the soil surface at a depth of 15 cm were dominated by
   white noise and directional trends.}},

   around a drift near which the stress redistribution induces changes in
   hydraulic conductivity. Purely radial flow, regional flow around an open
   or cemented hole without pumping or injection, and combined regional and
   radial flow are considered. Variations of hydraulic potential and Darcy
   velocity in various radial directions are studied for several cases and
   are found to be strongly affected by a complex skin. It is shown that
   the convergence of the streamlines toward the borehole, which is used in
   applications involving the point dilution method of measuring regional
   flow velocity, is significantly enhanced by a complex negative skin.
   Negative skin values may also reduce the size of the capture zone of a
   withdrawal well. Head distribution and tracer transport in combined
   radial and regional flow around a drift have also been modeled. It is
   demonstrated that tracer breakthrough curves from an experiment of
   tracer transport from an injection zone in the rock to the drift can be
   significantly affected by the fluid flow pattern around the drift, so
   the commonly used radial pattern may lead to erroneous results for
   tracer dispersivity.}},

Abstract = {{The tendency to ergodicity of transport through heterogeneous stratified
   formations by a flow tilted with respect to the bedding is examined in
   this note. The idealized model of evenly stratified formations resembles
   recharge areas in naturally layered sedimentary geological structures
   over short distances, and transport features of more complex
   heterogeneous structures. Two cases are considered herein:  the ergodic
   limit and the nonergodic regime. In the former case the theory predicts
   a constant asymptotic value of longitudinal dispersivity controlled by
   the log transmissivity integral scale. In the latter case, asymptotic
   results of an analytic nature are derived for the limit case of large
   travel times. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to study the plume
   evolutions for a wide range of heterogeneities and of initial size of
   the solute body transverse to the bedding. Results are compared with the
   analytical solution. It is concluded that, in the realistic case of
   finite initial transverse size of the plumes, ergodicity is not obeyed.
   Ergodic conditions, in our experiments, were not achieved even for a
   solute body whose dimension was 400 times the log transmissivity
   correlation scale. In such cases, theoretical and numerical evidence
   suggests that in nonergodic regimes the longitudinal dispersion
   coefficient tends asymptotically to zero for any initial size of the
   solute body.}},

Abstract = {{Simulated annealing is introduced and applied to the optimization of
   groundwater management problems cast in combinatorial form.  This
   heuristic, probabilistic optimization method seeks minima in analogy
   with the annealing of solids and is effective on large-scale problems. 
   No continuity requirements are imposed on objective (cost) functions. 
   Constraints may be added to the cost function via penalties, imposed by
   designation of the solution domain, or imbedded in submodels (e.g., mass
   balance in aquifer flow simulators) used to evaluate costs.  The
   location of global optima may be theoretically guaranteed, but
   computational limitations lead to searches for nearly optimal solutions
   in practice.  Like other optimization methods, most of the computational
   effort is expended in flow and transport simulators.  Practical
   algorithmic guidance that leads to enormous computational savings and
   sometimes makes simulated annealing competitive with gradient-type
   optimization methods is provided.  The method is illustrated by example
   applications to idealized problems of groundwater flow and selection of
   remediation strategy, including optimization with multiple groundwater
   control technologies.  They demonstrate the flexibility of the method
   and indicate its potential for solving groundwater management problems. 
   The application of simulated annealing to water resources problems is
   new and its development is immature, so further performance improvements
   can be expected.}},

Abstract = {{Use of mathematical models in water resource management has been plagued
   in the past by the lack of communication, understanding, and involvement
   of managers in the model development.  Interactive modeling methods give
   managers an appropriate role in model use, calibration, and
   verification.  This paper extends the idea of interactive reservoir
   modeling using the intelligent decision support system approach.  An
   advisory tool developed using this approach integrates formal reservoir
   models with reservoir expertise for making both numerical and logical
   inferences.  This integration required special treatment, programming
   skills, and representations.  This tool is intended to help a user to
   select and use the proper formal model(s) for single multipurpose
   reservoir analysis.  The use of the tool may improve the accuracy and
   effectiveness of information available to managers, decision makers, and
   researchers.  A practical example of the Gruza reservoir study
   demonstrates the benefits of implementing the approach.}},

Abstract = {{A model of contingent market behavior is developed which emphasizes the
   role of household information about wetlands and related environmental
   goods.  Information is acquired through previous experience with
   wetlands and through the contingent market.  Households which are
   unaware of substitute or complement environmental goods when
   participating in contingent markets may overstate or understate
   willingness to pay values.  This paper estimates willingness to pay for
   preservation of the Clear Creek wetland in western Kentucky when faced
   with surface coal mining.  We test for the effects of explicit
   information about related environmental goods on contingent values by
   measuring the difference in stated willingness to pay.  Willingness to
   pay for preservation of the Clear Creek wetland decreases with
   information about surface coal mine lake reclamation and, in the
   initial, independent format increases with information about a nearby
   publicly owned, wetland area.  These findings suggest that the lack of
   explicit information about related environmental goods in contingent
   markets can contribute to a misstatement of willingness to pay.}},

Abstract = {{A chloride tracer was applied to the surface of a vegetable field and
   then leached downward by rainfall and irrigation.  Tracer concentrations
   in a vertical two-dimensional region down to a depth of 2.4 m were
   monitored with suction cups that were installed horizontally from a
   tunnel.  The uniformly applied tracer pulse split into a slowly moving
   main pulse and a series of fast pulses.  The first of the fast pulses
   reached a depth of 2.2 m after an infiltration of just 31 mm of natural
   rainfall, whereas the peak of the main pulse was still at a depth of
   0.84 m by the end of the experiment after an infiltration of 0.853 m. 
   The movement of the main pulse can be described by a
   convection-dispersion process in a homogeneous medium, provided that
   time is replaced by cumulative infiltration.  However, the values of the
   parameters that produce a maximum agreement between the model and the
   observed main pulse have no physical basis, and consequently prediction
   of solute movement, based on measurements of soil properties, is not
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of hydrogeochemical processes was studied within
   an 18-m-thick unit of clayey till beneath a flat prairie landscape. 
   Models of major element mass transfer, constrained by chemical,
   mineralogical, and isotopic measurements on waters and solids, were
   developed for two end-member water quality types occurring within the
   unit.  The observed pattern of chemical variation, which is
   predominantly lateral on a scale of tens of meters, is caused by
   microtopographically controlled differences in the ratio of vertical
   water flux to oxidation rate associated with depression-focused
   recharge.  Such variation is to be expected where dynamic flow regimes
   develop in thin surficial tills containing chemically reduced
   constituents.  Observed depletions of major elements from oxidized zones
   of the till support the mass transfer models and demonstrate that the
   time scales of persistence of hydrogeochemical variability in the till
   and of water quality evolution in the aquifer beneath range from 10(4)
   to 10(5) year.  Na and S concentrations in such aquifers will depend
   primarily on ratios of influxes of end-member water quality types from
   the till above, while Ca, Mg, and inorganic C concentrations will remain
   high as long as partial pressures of CO2 in the till remain high.  CO2
   generation in the till is discussed in the companion paper (Keller, this
   issue).}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distributions of inorganic and organic carbon in gas,
   aqueous, and solid phases were studied in an 18-m-thick surficial
   deposit of fractured clayey calcareous till.  Large PCO2 increases were
   observed with increasing depth at the bottoms of vadose zones from which
   solid organic carbon had been depleted.  Hydrochemical reaction
   simulations indentified a reaction path consistent with PCO2, O2, major
   element chemistry, C-13, and C-14 isotope observations; this path is
   ``open{''} to a biogenic CO2 reservoir with PCO2 higher than, and C-14
   composition considerably different from, that of the soil zone.  Such
   CO2 reservoirs, occurring in deep-vadose/shallow saturated zones and
   thus isolated by overlying sediments from temperature fluctuations which
   limit soil-zone respiration, may be common in the Western Glaciated
   Plains as evidenced by prevalence of hard, high-PCO2 waters in the
   region's intertill aquifers.  Carbon 14 data suggest that in the till,
   both dissolved organic C and dissolved inorganic C have two sources: 
   soil organic matter and kerogen in the till matrix.  Regardless of
   source(s), initial C-14 activities of both aqueous C pools at the water
   table are ``diluted{''} substantially relative to the actual residence
   time of the water; unappreciated, this could cause large relative errors
   in the calculation of radiocarbon-based groundwater age dates.}},

Abstract = {{A periodic analytical theory previously tested only against diurnal
   variations is applied to a 66-day springtime period at Agassiz, British
   Columbia.  Comparison is made with daily average values of the surface
   energy balance components, soil temperatures, and near-surface
   atmospheric potential temperatures and water vapor densities measured
   throughout this period.  It is shown that the inability of the periodic
   theory to predict the measured warming trend at the 0.5 m depth in the
   soil can be overcome by applying the theory to the whole of 1978, i.e.,
   by imbedding the period of interest in a longer period.  A new
   analytical theory that accounts for aperiodic transient effects is also
   described and compared with measured soil temperatures.  This theory can
   also account for the observed soil warming trend but is sensitive to
   small errors in the prescribed soil surface heat flux density. 
   Additional analytical calculations show that advection of heat within
   the soil associated with evaporation and rainfall could have
   significantly influenced the long-term temperature trends observed at
   Agassiz.  The poorer success with the analytical approach when applied
   to long-term rather than diurnal variations suggests that to predict the
   former accurately a numerical model is required.}},

Abstract = {{A combination of input mapping (Rose et al., this issue) and Monte Carlo
   simulation was used to quantitatively compare the predictions of the
   Integrated Lake Watershed Acidification Study (ILWAS), Model of
   Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC), and Enhanced Trickle
   Down (ETD) watershed acidification models.  Monte Carlo simulation was
   used to impose regional variability on selected model inputs of two
   dissimilar watersheds resembling those found in the northeastern United
   States for four different SO42- deposition scenarios.  Model predictions
   were viewed in aggregate (distributions, medians) corresponding to
   population-level predictions, and on an iteration-by-iteration basis
   corresponding to watershed-specific predictions.  For each of these,
   predicted values of acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) were treated as
   relative scale (changes in ANC in response to changes in deposition) and
   absolute scale (ANC concentrations, number of acidic lakes) predictions.
   Aggregate and iteration-specific predictions viewed on a relative scale
   were similar for three models under small to moderate changes in SO42-
   deposition.  Aggregate and iteration-specific predictions differed among
   models when viewed on an absolute scale.  Absolute scale predictions
   were most similar under conditions of high variability in deposition. 
   Proper interpretation of multiple model forecasts requires objective
   quantification of the effects of model differences on predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the steady state distribution of air pressure in the
   unsaturated zone resulting from a pneumatic test provides a method for
   determining air-phase permeability.  This technique is analogous to the
   inverse problem of well hydraulics; however, air flow is more
   complicated than ground water flow because of air compressibility, the
   Klinkenberg effect, variations in air density and viscosity that result
   from temperature fluctuations in the unsaturated zone and the
   possibility of inducing water movement during the pneumatic test.  An
   analysis of these complicating factors reveals that, when induced water
   movement can be neglected, a linear version of the airflow equation can
   provide an appropriate approximation for the purpose of determining
   air-phase permeability.  Two analytical solutions for steady state,
   two-dimensional, axisymmetric airflow to a single well partially
   screened in the unsaturated zone are developed.  One solution applies
   where there is a stratum of relatively low air permeability, separating
   the stratum in which the well is completed, from the atmosphere.  The
   other solution applies where there is no separating stratum between the
   domain and atmosphere.  In both situations the water table forms the
   lower horizontal boundary.  Applications of both solutions to determine
   air permeability from data collected during pneumatic tests are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution coefficients (K(d)), defined as the ratio of the
   concentration of solute associated with the solids to the concentration
   in solution, are widely used in the prediction of reactive solute
   transport.  With the advent of stochastic approaches to describe solute
   transport, there is a need to examine the spatial distribution of K(d),
   and its correlation with the hydraulic conductivity (K).  Distribution
   coefficients were measured in triplicates for strontium on 1279
   subsamples of cores from Canadian Forces Base Borden for which K
   measurements were available.  The K(d) values ranged from 4.4 to 29.8
   mL/g, with a mean of 9.9 and standard deviation of 2.89 mL/g.  The
   standard error on the triplicate means was 0.95 mL/g or approximately
   10\% of the mean.  The spatial behavior of K(d) and K (expressed as ln
   (K(d)) and ln (K)) was examined in three directions:  horizontally along
   two orthogonal transects and vertically.  The two variables each behaved
   nearly identically in the two horizontal directions, suggesting
   horizontal isotropy.  Horizontally, ln (K(d)) appeared as ``white
   noise{''} suggesting that the horizontal spacing between cores (1 m) was
   too large to detect any self-correlation.  The distribution coefficient
   displayed increasing power spectral density with increasing scale in the
   vertical direction, while ln (K) showed these trends in all directions. 
   Depending on the model used, the correlation lengths obtained by least
   squares fits of the power spectra varied from 1 to 7.5 m horizontally
   and from 10 to 30 cm vertically for ln (K); and from 30 cm to 2 m
   horizontally and from 30 to 70 cm vertically for ln (K(d)).  The ln
   (K(d)) values showed a significant but very weak negative overall
   correlation with ln (K) at the 99.95\% confidence level.  The
   cross-spectral and coherency analysis showed that the sign and degree of
   correlation between ln (K(d)) depended on the scale and direction
   considered.  The correlations in all directions and at all scales were
   weak, and could not always be declared significantly different than zero
   at the 95\% confidence level.}},

Abstract = {{The ``conductance{''} mesh method is used to determine the permeability
   properties of natural and simulated, two-dimensional, fracture patterns.
   In the method, the fractures and their matrix are discretized on a grid
   of 200 x 200 elements.  The permeability of the whole pattern in the
   direction of the pressure gradient is determined from the total flow
   through the network.  By applying the model in varying orientations, a
   picture of the directional permeability is constructed.  Using the
   model, the effects of varying matrix permeability and fracture aperture
   on the global permeability of a natural fracture pattern and 10
   simulations are investigated.  The stimulated fracture patterns were
   found to increasingly underestimate the permeability of the natural
   pattern as the permeability contrast between rock matrix and fractures
   increased.  The lower permeability of the simulations was found to
   relate to their poorer connectivity, as reflected in the sizes of their
   ``backbones{''} (comprising all paths across the region along the
   fracture network) and in the number and type of fracture intersections. 
   The results show that the effect of the natural pattern spatial
   distribution is to promote fracture intersection, thereby increasing
   connectivity and permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of soil heterogeneity on the transport of moisture in the
   unsaturated zone are studied by means of functional sensitivities, which
   are more suitable than elementary (or conventional) sensitivities for
   analyzing continuous systems.  The earlier described algorithm is
   applied to three problems, drainage, infiltration, and exfiltration, for
   two Miller-similar soils (a randomly generated heterogeneous Yolo light
   clay and a homogeneous one).  It reveals the difference between
   drainage, on the one hand, and both infiltration and exfiltration on the
   other.  The scaled flux sensitivity profiles, i.e., the functional
   derivatives of fluxes with respect to Miller-similarity parameter lambda
   (chi), are flat for drainage, demonstrating that drainage is equally
   sensitive to changes in lambda (chi) at all points of the profile and
   hence that the similarity parameter has to be modeled well in the whole
   soil column.  Analogous sensitivity profiles for infiltration and
   exfiltration problems show significant delay in propagation of
   functional sensitivities in the soil column (with respect to the
   moisture front), allowing thus for less stringent modeling of the
   similarity parameter for the bottom of the column.  Infiltration
   problems seem to be most difficult to deal with, because they are most
   sensitive to the similarity parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Several authors have now used the Backlund transformation to linearize
   Richard's equation and so obtain analytical solutions for infiltration
   and redistribution processes for the linearizable class of diffusivities
   and hydraulic conductivities.  After transformation a
   convection-diffusion equation is obtained.  To date, all the analytical
   results making use of the Backlund transform have been based on a
   specified, constant flux that is assumed to exist at the surface
   boundary.  We generalize the previous work by removing this restriction
   and obtain a general solution for an arbitrary temporal variation in
   surface flux.  The solution contains a function that is specified by a
   Volterra integral equation.  In practice, the Volterra equation must be
   evaluated numerically.  This task is accomplished using a relatively
   straightforward algorithm.  The analytical results for infiltration can
   be applied to the process of solute transport subject to a nonlinear
   adsorption isotherm since these two phenomena are equivalent under
   another mapping.  Our new analytical results, therefore, also apply to
   this class of solute transport processes.  The general form of the
   adsorption isotherm for which exact results can be obtained is derived. 
   This isotherm appears capable of representing a relatively large family
   of physically relevant cases, although this topic remains open for
   future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Three approaches to determining mean soil water residence times in a
   steep headwater catchment were investigated.  The deuterium
   concentrations of soil water collected from 11 suction cup samplers at
   the Maimai M8 catchment were determined weekly for 14 weeks and the
   results compared with those of rainfall in the same period.  Deuterium
   variations in the suction samples were considerably delayed and
   diminished compared with the rainfall, indicating significant storage
   times and mixing with soil water.  Soil matrix water at shallow levels
   (approximately 200 mm depth) in unsaturated soils was relatively
   responsive to fresh input, but deeper water and water near the stream
   subject to occasional water table rises showed much less variation. 
   Steady state and non-steady state exponential models gave similar mean
   residence times, ranging from 12 to more than 100 days for different
   locations.  Three groups of soil water response were defined, comprising
   shallow, medium and deep (near-stream) soil locations based on the mean
   residence times.  The nonsteady models revealed considerable
   week-to-week and longer variations in mean residence time for shallow
   soil (SL4), but indicated that steady state models could adequately
   represent the system in the overall period investigated.  In the third
   approach, model types and parameters that gave the best fits to the soil
   water deuterium concentrations were determined.  Exponential and
   especially dispersion models were the most satisfactory.  Weighting the
   input (rainfall delta-D) partially or fully with the amount of rainfall
   gave much worse fits than with the unweighted input, showing that much
   of the rainfall bypasses the soil matrix.  The best fitting dispersion
   model (designated DM2) yielded the most accurate mean residence times: 
   13 days for shallow soil (SL4), 42 days for soil at 400 mm depth (SL5),
   both at midslope locations, and 63 days for soil at 800 mm depth near
   the stream (SL2).  Capillary flow was important for the unsaturated
   shallow soil (SL4), while advection and hydrodynamic dispersion (mixing)
   were more dominant for the periodically saturated (SL5) and the
   generally saturated (SL2) soils.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive field trench study was conducted in a semiarid area of
   southern New Mexico to provide data to test deterministic and stochastic
   models of vadose zone flow and transport.  A 4 m by 9 m area was
   irrigated with water containing a tracer using a carefully controlled
   drip irrigation system.  The area was heavily instrumented with
   tensiometers and neutron probe access tubes to monitor water movement
   and with suction tubes to monitor solute transport.  Approximately 600
   disturbed and 600 core samples of soil were taken to support
   deterministic and stochastic characterization of the soil water
   hydraulic parameters.  The core sample-based saturated hydraulic
   conductivities ranged from 1.4 to 6731 cm/d with a mean of 533 cm/d and
   a standard deviation of 647 cm/d, indicating significant spatial
   variability.  However, visual observation of the wetting front on the
   trench wall shows no indication of preferential flow or water flow
   through visible root channels and cracks.  The tensiometer readings and
   the neutron probe measurements also suggest that the wetting front moves
   in a fairly homogeneous fashion despite the significant spatial
   variability of the saturated hydraulic conductivity.  In addition to the
   description of the experiment and the presentation of the experimental
   results, predictions of simple one-dimensional uniform and layered soil
   deterministic models for infiltration are presented and compared to
   field observations.  These models are presented here to provide a base
   case against which more sophisticated deterministic and stochastic
   models can be compared in the future.  The results indicate that the
   simple models give adequate predictions of the overall movement of the
   wetting front through the soil during infiltration.  However, the models
   give poor predictions of point values for water content due to the
   spatial variability of the soil.  Comparisons between the
   one-dimensional infiltration model predictions and field observations
   show that the use of the layered soil model rather than the uniform soil
   model does not consistently improve the accuracy of the predictions for
   this particular field application.  This result illustrates that
   increasing the spatial resolution of the deterministic characterization
   of the site in the vertical direction does not always improve the model
   predictions.  Uncertainties due to horizontal spatial variability and
   due to other difficulties associated with experimental characterization
   appear to be more significant.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a comprehensive field study designed to provide data to test
   stochastic and deterministic models of water flow and contaminant
   transport in the vadose zone, several trench experiments were performed
   in the semiarid region of southern New Mexico.  The first trench
   experiment is discussed by Wierenga et al. (this issue).  During the
   second trench experiment, a 1.2 m wide by 12 m long area on the north
   side of and parallel to a 26.4 m long by 4.8 m wide by 6 m deep trench
   was irrigated with water containing tracers using a carefully controlled
   drip irrigation system.  The irrigated area was heavily instrumented
   with tensiometers and neutron probe access tubes to monitor water
   movement, and with suction samplers to monitor solute transport.  Water
   containing tritium and bromide was applied during the first 11.5 days of
   the study.  Thereafter, water was applied without tracers for an
   additional 64 days.  Both water movement and tracer movement were
   monitored in the subsoil during infiltration and redistribution.  The
   experimental results indicate that water and bromide moved fairly
   uniformly during infiltration and the bromide moved ahead of the tritium
   due to anion exclusion during redistribution.  Comparisons between
   measurements and predictions made with a two-dimensional model show
   qualitative agreement for two of the three water content measurement
   planes.  Model predictions of tritium and bromide transport were not as
   satisfactory.  Measurements of both tritium and bromide show localized
   areas of high relative concentrations and a large downward motion of
   bromide relative to tritium during redistribution.  While the simple
   deterministic model does show larger downward motions for bromide than
   for tritium during redistribution, it does not predict the high
   concentrations of solute observed during infiltration, nor can it
   predict the heterogeneous behavior observed for tritium during
   infiltration and for bromide during redistribution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents several analytical solutions for three-dimensional
   solute transport in semi-infinite porous media with unidirectional flow
   using first-type (or concentration) and third-type (or flux) boundary
   conditions at the inlet location of the medium.  The solutions may be
   used for predicting solute concentrations in homogeneous media,
   verification of more comprehensive numerical models, and laboratory or
   field determination of solute transport parameters.  The transport
   equation incorporates terms accounting for advection, dispersion,
   zero-order production, and first-order decay.  General solutions were
   derived for an arbitrary initial distribution and solute input with the
   help of Laplace, Fourier, and Hankel transforms.  Specific solutions are
   presented for rectangular and circular solute inflow regions, as well as
   for solutes initially present in the form of parallelepipedal or
   cylindrical regions of the medium.  The solutions were mathematically
   verified against simplified analytical solutions.  Examples of
   concentration profiles are presented for several solute transport
   parameters using both first- and third-type boundary conditions.  A mass
   balance constraints is defined based on a prescribed solute influx; the
   third-type condition is shown to conserve mass whereas the first-type
   condition was found to always overestimate resident solute
   concentrations in the medium.}},

   analysis of unsaturated or saturated flow in a system of parallel
   nonhomogeneous one-, two-, or three-dimensional soil profiles. The

   techniques are outlined and demonstrated by examples for direct
   identification of scaling factors based on measured soil hydraulic data,
   and indirect identification based on measured dynamic characteristics of
   a soil water system. Suggested applications of the discussed concept are
   (1) the classification of soils according to the shape of their

   variability of soil water properties for numerical modeling purposes.}},

   In this work, we examine solute transport in a uniform homogeneous

   used in situ in a packed column to make observations of solute

   assumed to be ideal and the flow field is restricted to be fully
   saturated and laminar.  Using data measured at the pore level, we study
   the spatial variability in the concentration field during miscible

Abstract = {{The at-a-station hydraulic geometry of stream channels that are in
   quasi-equilibrium has been associated with the minimum variance concept.
   In this study, minimum variance is viewed as a particular approach to
   implementing a more fundamental idea, that of equable change in
   at-a-station hydraulic geometry in response to change in discharge.  An
   alternative approach to characterizing equable change is formulated in
   terms of variables transformed to z scores.  The hypothesis of equable
   change is tested by imposing a restriction of equal exponents on a
   system of hydraulic geometry equations formulated in terms of these
   variables.  This is equivalent to testing the hypothesis that the
   correlations between hydraulic geometry variables and discharge are all
   equal.  The hydraulic geometry of 35 of 61 sites analyzed is consistent
   with the equable change principle, implying that these channels are in a
   quasi-equilibrium state.  Constraints on width adjustment or velocity
   adjustment appear to operate in a large number of the remaining sites. 
   Channels that are consistent with the equable change principle are
   compared across a number of characteristics with channels that manifest
   width and velocity constraints, in order to gain insight into the nature
   of these constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a new methodology for designing and analyzing
   three-dimensional sampling networks for groundwater quality monitoring.
   Sampling design is represented in the frequency domain as a transfer
   function acting on the concentration spectrum to provide the sampling
   error variance, which is used as a measure of sampling performance. The
   presented methodology does not require numerical solution of either flow
   or transport equations; it operates directly on the statistics of the
   concentration field evaluated using a spectral representation. It also
   separates sampling design issues from the statistics of the aquifer
   properties, allowing better understanding of the influence of the
   subsurface characteristics on sampling error and therefore on sampling
   network design. The results show that sampling of groundwater quality
   should be viewed as a three-dimensional activity with two major design
   parameters: spatial spacing between wells (DELTA-l(i), i = 1, 2, 3) and
   total number of wells. In the horizontal plane there is a clear need for
   anisotropy in spacing between wells with larger spacing needed in the
   direction of the mean flow than in the perpendicular direction. The
   sampling anisotropy ratio DELTA-l1/DELTA-l2 is found to be a function of
   the correlation structure of the hydraulic conductivity field and number
   of wells. The presented example demonstrates how sampling network design
   guidelines can be developed as functions of the statistical structure of
   the hydraulic conductivity field and other transport parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model is proposed for the prediction of the electrical
   conductivity of bulk soil in saturated and in unsaturated states.  The
   model is based on the hypothesis that the tortuosity factor affecting
   the bulk soil electrical conductivity is identical to that defined for
   prediction of the soil hydraulic conductivity.  Simple mathematical
   functions are derived to forecast the soil electrical conductivity as a
   function of the water content.  Experimental results of seven previous
   studies carried out on 26 soils were used for validation tests.  The
   model's efficiency as a predictive tool, in cases where limited
   experimental data are available, is found to be generally good.}},

Abstract = {{The use of a given effective rainfall and a stochastic integral equation
   formulation of the well-known unit hydrograph method gives criterion
   design variables, such as volume or maximum discharge, which are random
   variables depending on the stochastic variation in the unit hydrographs.
   When this variation is modeled by means of a multivariate normal
   distribution, it is possible to compute the distribution of criterion
   variable values.  For example, the total runoff volume can be shown to
   be normally distributed, and so confidence intervals for this design
   variable can be directly obtained.  Note that this probability
   distribution is for a fixed design storm and is due to the multivariate
   normal variation in the unit hydrograph.  A computer simulation can be
   used to obtain confidence intervals for the maximum discharge estimate. 
   Similarly, probabilistic simulation can be used to develop confidence
   intervals for other criterion variables.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of optimally combining data from an array of point rain
   gages with those from a low Earth-orbiting satellite to obtain
   space-time averaged rain rates is considered.  The mean square error due
   to sampling gaps in space-time can be expressed as an integral of a
   filter multiplied by the space-time spectral density of the rain rate
   field.  It is shown that for large numbers of gages or large numbers of
   overpasses the two estimates can be regarded as orthogonal in the sense
   that the optimal weighting is the same as for independent estimators,
   i.e., the weights are inversely proportional to the error variances that
   would occur in the single-component case.  The result involving point
   gages and satellite overpasses appears to hold under quite general
   conditions.  The result is interesting since most other design
   combinations do not exhibit the orthogonality property.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical properties of level crossings for stationary Gaussian
   processes have been applied in the past to model empirical crossing
   behavior of streamflow data with some success.  However, when the
   marginal distributions exhibit departures from normality, such as high
   coefficients of skewness, the theoretical Gaussian results perform
   poorly in modeling empirical crossing behavior.  In this paper we
   present theoretical results for crossings of levels by two nin-Gaussian
   processes, namely, the chi-square process and the lognormal process. 
   The chi-square process does not appear to have been applied previously
   in the hydrologic literature.  We apply both models to a skewed annual
   flow series.  Comparisons with the Gaussian model are made and
   noticeable improvements are found in both cases.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes of oxygen, and natural and fallout radionuclides, have
   been used, respectively, to identify water sources and to quantify
   watershed fluxes of precipitation-borne solutes and particles that come
   in contact with tundra vegetation at Imnavait Creek, Alaska (68-degrees
   37'N, 149-degrees 17'W).  Oxygen 18/oxygen 16 ratios of water in the
   snowpack, stream, and unfrozen soil during the peak of snowmelt showed
   that less than approximately 14\% of streamwater was derived from
   sources other than snow.  Within a month of snowmelt, O-18/O-16 ratios
   in the stream indicated that only negligible amounts of water derived
   from snow remained in the watershed.  In contrast to the low degree of
   mixing between snow and underlying soil water, greater than 90\% of the
   atmospherically derived Be-7 (53-day half-life) that was deposited in
   the snowpack was adsorbed onto the surface 2-3 cm of frozen organic
   soils and vegetation.  A slightly lower degree of absorption
   (approximately 2/3) on tundra was observed for atmospherically derived
   S-35 (87-day half-life) released during snowmelt.  These data indicate
   that atmospherically derived substances in the snowpack are often
   retained strongly by sorption or chemical interaction with vegetation
   and soil during snowmelt.  This conclusion is also supported by the
   vegetation and soil inventories of Cs-137 (30.2-year half-life), which
   are similar to values expected as a result of atmospheric deposition
   over the past 40 years.}},

Abstract = {{A network of piezometers was installed in a surficial lacustrine clay
   aquitard overlying a thin saline water aquifer of volcanoclastic origin
   at a study site near Mexico City in the Basin of Mexico.  The aquifer is
   underlain by additional lacustrine sediments which in turn overlie a
   thick regional freshwater aquifer.  The regional aquifer provides
   approximately 70\% of the water supply for 20 million people in the
   Basin of Mexico.  In the study area, major ions, oxygen 18, and
   deuterium in the pore water of the surficial aquitard exhibit large
   variations with depth.  The nature of these variations suggests that the
   saline pore water is being displaced downward by infiltrating meteoric
   water.  The infiltration has been induced by strong downward hydraulic
   gradients imposed two to three decades ago when heavy aquifer pumping of
   the thin saline water aquifer began.  One-dimensional analytical models
   representing solute transport in both fractured and unfractured porous
   media were used to simulate the geochemical profiles in the surficial
   aquitard.  The fractured porous medium model, using a realistic mean
   hydraulic gradient and fracture spacing (1.5 m) and small but
   significant fracture aperture (30-mu-m) provide nearly an exact match to
   the field data.  From this we infer that, because of vertical fractures,
   there is a much greater potential for downward leakage of water and
   contaminants through the Mexico City clay into underlying aquifers than
   has been previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents new results on a method for optimal aquifer
   remediation when available information is limited. The methodology
   combines computer simulation models of solute transport and fate,
   descriptions of spatial variability, probabilistic analysis of
   uncertainty, and optimization. The objective is to find the most
   cost-effective management policy for aquifer decontamination. Advantages
   of the method include the following: (1) it utilizes measurements in
   real time, (2) it simultaneously estimates aquifer parameters and makes
   decisions for remediation, and (3) it devises a more cost-effective and
   reliable aquifer remediation strategy than deterministic optimization,
   specifically, the method known as deterministic feedback control.
   Subject to constraints and for a given reliability of meeting water
   quality standards, this method minimizes the expected value of the cost
   in the remaining periods. That is, because of incomplete information
   about the site the cost of a decontamination strategy is not known a
   priori. The objective is to minimize the cost weighted by the
   probability that it will be incurred. The optimal aquifer management
   policy is expressed as the sum of a deterministic and a stochastic
   control term. The former is obtained by solving a deterministic
   optimization problem through constrained differential dynamic
   programming, and the latter is obtained by a perturbation approximation
   to the stochastic optimal control problem. Extended Kalman filtering is
   incorporated into the optimization method to improve the accuracy of the
   estimated state and parametric variables using available measurements. A
   hypothetical contamination case with two-dimensional unsteady flow and
   transport for a persistent solute is studied to illustrate the
   applicability of the methodology. The effectiveness in terms of cost and
   reliability of the proposed method is studied under various conditions
   and then compared with the cost and reliability of the deterministic
   feedback control method through Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed
   methodology is shown to be superior to deterministic feedback control.}},

Abstract = {{Four different methods of parameterizing spatially varying log
   transmissivities in an inverse approach are compared with respect to
   prediction accuracy of simulated flow and transport.  Transport
   parameter estimation is included by two-stage feedback optimization.  In
   stage one the log transmissivities are estimated by fitting both head
   and concentration data, given initial values of the source concentration
   and the dispersivities.  In stage two, the source concentration and the
   dispersivities are estimated by fitting the concentration data.  With
   the updated transport parameters, final estimates of the log
   transmissivities are obtained by repeating the optimization of stage
   one.  The formulated objective functions are minimized using
   Levenberg-Marquardt's algorithm.  The models are applied to synthetic
   two-dimensional transport problems in steady state flow regimes.  The
   ``true{''} log transmissivity fields are generated by the turning bands
   method, thereby incorporating spatial variability.  The test cases
   differ in the input variances of the generated fields and with respect
   to the amount and accuracy of ``observed{''} transmissivity data.}},

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken to quantitatively evaluate the hydrologic
   processes affecting the chemical and isotopic composition of drain
   lateral water in a drained agricultural field in the western San Joaquin
   Valley, California.  The results elucidate the process of mixing of deep
   and shallow groundwater (below and within 6 m from land surface)
   entering the drain laterals.  The deep groundwater was subject to
   evapoconcentration prior to drainage system installation and has been
   displaced downward (to depths greater than 6 m) in the groundwater
   system.  The proportions of deep and shallow groundwater entering the
   drain laterals was calculated from the end-member oxygen 18 compositions
   determined in groundwater samples.  The percentage of total drain
   lateral flow which is deep groundwater flow is about 30\% for the
   shallow drain lateral (1.8 m below land surface) (drain lateral 1)) and
   60\% for the deep drain lateral (2.7 m below land surface (drain lateral
   2)).  During irrigation, the percentages of deep groundwater flow
   decrease to 0 and 30\% for the shallow and deep drain laterals,
   respectively.  Selenium concentrations in drain lateral waters decrease
   during irrigation but selenium loads increase.  Total estimated annual
   loads were 1.1 and 5.4 kg of selenium for drain laterals 1 and 2,
   respectively.  Substantial percentages of the annual load occurred
   during 8 days of irrigation, 23 and 9\% for drain laterals 1 and 2,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater flow modeling was used to quantitatively assess the
   hydrologic processes affecting groundwater and solute movement to drain
   laterals.  Modeling results were used to calculate the depth
   distribution of groundwater flowing into drain laterals at 1.8 m (drain
   lateral 1) and 2.7 m (drain lateral 2) below land surface.  The
   simulations indicated that under nonirrigated conditions about 89\% of
   the flow in drain lateral 2 was from groundwater originating from depths
   greater than 6 m below land surface.  The deep groundwater has higher
   selenium concentrations than shallow groundwater.  Simulation of
   irrigated conditions indicates that as recharge (deep percolation)
   increases, the proportional contribution of deep groundwater to drain
   lateral flow decreases.  Groundwater flow paths and travel times
   estimated from the simulation results indicate that groundwater
   containing high concentrations of selenium (greater than 780-mu-g L-1)
   probably will continue to enter drain lateral 2 for decades.}},

Abstract = {{A flexible finite element transport model, which includes the impact of
   vapor sorption, is developed to simulate the movement of volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) in variably saturated porous media.  The
   two-dimensional numerical model predicts contaminant transport by
   aqueous advection, aqueous dispersion, aqueous and vapor diffusion, and
   surface volatilization.  For a soil with increasing water contents with
   depth, one-dimensional simulations demonstrate that strong vapor
   sorption may reduce the total amount of VOC that volatilizes in 100 days
   from 84.6\% of the initial mass volatilized without vapor sorption to
   73.2\%.  Yet, for a soil with low water contents at depth, such as in an
   area with limited recharge, vapor sorption enhanced the rate of
   volatilization in 100 days from 72.4\% without vapor sorption to a peak
   of 90.3\%.  When low soil moisture was combined with a soil type that
   has strong vapor sorption characteristics, VOC transport was
   significantly retarded.}},

Abstract = {{Apparent, or effective, infiltration rates on grassland hillslopes vary
   with rainfall intensity and flow depth because of the interaction
   between rainfall, runoff, and vegetated microtopography.  The higher
   parts of the microtopography are occupied by greater densities of
   macropores and therefore have much greater hydraulic conductivities than
   the intervening microdepressions.  On short hillslopes and plots the
   apparent infiltration rate is simply the spatial average of the
   saturated and unsaturated conductivities of this surface.  The
   proportion of the surface which is saturated and the value to which the
   unsaturated conductivity is raised depends on the rainfall intensity. 
   On longer hillslopes the downslope increase in flow depth in
   microtopographic depressions progressively inundates more permeable,
   vegetated mounds so that the hydraulic conductivity of a greater
   proportion of the surface is raised to its saturated value.  For this
   reason the apparent infiltration rate increases downslope, even in the
   absence of spatial trends in any of the surface characteristics that
   affect infiltration.  Apparent, or effective, infiltration rate depends
   on hillslope length.  Consequently, steady state discharge does not
   increase linearly with distance downslope.  These two fundamental
   relationships between infiltration, rainfall intensity, and runoff are
   analyzed on the basis of sprinkling-infiltrometer measurements and a
   mathematical model.}},

Abstract = {{The transport of linearly interacting solutes in porous media is
   investigated with the help of residence time distributions, transfer
   functions, methods of system dynamics, and time-moment analyses.  The
   classical one-dimensional convection-dispersion equation is extended to
   two-region (mobile-immobile water) transport by including diffusional
   mass transfer limitations characteristic of aggregated soils.  The
   two-region model is further revised by incorporating the effects of
   multiple retention sites (in parallel or in series), multiple porosity
   levels, and arbitrary but steady flow fields.  It is shown that
   different physical situations can be represented by a relatively small
   number of transfer functions containing only two types of parameters: 
   distribution coefficients to account for equilibrium properties and
   characteristic times reflecting kinetic processes.  Relevant kinetic
   processes include convective transport, hydrodynamic dispersion,
   adsorption-desorption, and physical or chemical mass transfer
   limitations.  In most situations, theoretical breakthrough curves are
   found to be relatively insensitive to the mathematical structure of the
   transfer function, irrespective of the physical interpretation of the
   distribution coefficients and the characteristic times in the model. 
   This means that alternative physical and chemical interpretations of
   model parameters can lead to nearly identical breakthrough curves. 
   Certain transfer time distributions can lead to quite unusual shapes in
   the breakthrough curves; these curves strongly depend on the
   characteristic times and a few operational variables.  Results of this
   study show that the transfer time distribution is an extremely useful
   tool for explaining some unexpected experimental results in the solute
   transport literature.}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of strong dispersion the ratio of atmospherically derived
   tritium (H-3) and its stable daughter, helium 3 (He-3), can be used to
   accurately date shallow groundwater with ages ranging from 0 to about 50
   years.  The effects of dispersion of H-3/He-3 ages are examined by
   numerical simulation in simple one- and two-dimensional flow systems. 
   For a H-3 input function that is relatively constant in time the
   difference between H-3/He-3 ages and purely advective groundwater travel
   times is controlled by the relative magnitude of the groundwater
   velocity, the H-3 decay constant, and the dispersivity of the porous
   media.  In many shallow sandy aquifers the groundwater velocity is
   sufficiently large and the dispersivity sufficiently small that the
   difference between the true groundwater travel time and the H-3/He-3 age
   near the water table can be neglected (< 10\% difference).  This
   suggests that measurements of the H-3/He-3 age gradient near the water
   table can be used to estimate recharge rates and vertical velocity
   values with a high degree of spatial resolution.  In contrast to H-3
   activities, modeled H-3/He-3 ages are relatively insensitive to
   uncertainties with respect to the H-3 input function.  Thus combined
   measurements of H-3 and He-3 offer considerable advantage over
   measurements of H-3 alone.  The ability to obtain reliable estimates of
   spatial variations in recharge rates combined with accurate groundwater
   ages in shallow unconfined aquifers will undoubtedly provide valuable
   constraints when calibrating models of groundwater flow and solute
   transport in such systems.}},

Abstract = {{In late 1988, parallel studies of Lake Five-O (pH 5.14) in the Florida
   panhandle and Lake Barco (pH 4.50) in north central Florida were
   initiated to develop hydrologic and major ion budgets of these lakes as
   part of an overall effort to improve understanding of the hydrologic,
   depositional, and biogeochemical factors that control acid-neutralizing
   capacity (ANC) in seepage lakes.  Preliminary findings from these
   studies indicate that earlier perceptions of lake hydrology and
   mechanisms of ANC regulation in Florida seepage lakes may have to be
   revised.  The traditional perspective of seepage lakes in the Florida
   panhandle views these systems as dominated by precipitation inputs and
   that ANC regulation is due largely to in-lake processes.  Our results
   for Lake Five-O show modest to steep hydraulic gradients almost entirely
   around the lake.  In addition, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of
   the surficial aquifer is high (8-74 m day-1), indicating that large
   quantities of groundwater flow into Lake Five-O.  Calculations of net
   groundwater flow from hydrologic budgets also indicate that groundwater
   may comprise at least 38 to 46\% of the total inflow.  For Lake Barco,
   net flow estimates of the minimum groundwater inflow range from 5 to
   14\% of total inflow.  Enrichment factor and ion flux calculations for
   Lake Five-O and Lake Barco indicate that terrestrial as well as in-lake
   processes contribute significantly to ANC regulation.  The extent that
   terrestrial processes contribute to ANC generation is directly related
   to the magnitude of groundwater inflow as well as the degree of ion
   enrichment or depletion that occurs in the surficial aquifer.  Net ANC
   generation in both study lakes was dominated by anion retention (NO3-
   and SO4(2-)).  Where previous studies concluded that in-lake reduction
   was the primary sink for SO4(2-), our preliminary calculations show that
   adsorption of SO4(2-) within the watershed is perhaps twice as important
   as in-lake reduction as a source of ANC.  Net base cation enrichment in
   both lakes was negligible.}},

Abstract = {{An air-driven secondary water recovery operation was proposed in order
   to recover water stored in the unsaturated zone of depleted aquifers and
   currently unavailable with conventional techniques.  The operation
   employed a single-well serving as both a production and injection
   facility and consisted of three stages:  (1) an air injection stage, (2)
   a ``recovery{''} stage, and (3) a ``production{''} (pumping) stage.  The
   concept of the operation was based on the hysteretic behavior of the
   capillary pressures and the relative permeabilities of air and water. 
   Hysteresis was counted upon to prevent water, forced into the saturated
   zone during injection, from migrating back to the unsaturated zone.  A
   general mathematical model was developed and numerically approximated
   using a simultaneous two-phase, three-dimensional finite difference
   model in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates.  Two types of
   nonlinearities were identified:  (1) pressure-related weak
   nonlinearities and (2) saturation-related strong nonlinearities. 
   Techniques to alleviate the resulting instabilities, as well as methods
   for the establishment of stable initial conditions and the treatment of
   boundary conditions, were developed.}},

Abstract = {{The finite difference equations of air and water flow in air-driven
   secondary water recovery define a multidimensional strongly nonlinear
   system with sharp pressure and saturation fronts, large differences in
   the magnitude of flow coefficients, physical and mathematical
   discontinuities, sudden flow reversals, and high injection rates.  The
   implicit simultaneous solution (SS) method, which solves simultaneously
   for the unknown pressures and saturation changes, was the sole method
   capable of handling these problems.  Instabilities were alleviated by
   introducing implicit flow coefficients, implicit capillary pressures,
   and implicit accumulation terms.  The treatment of hysteresis was based
   on petroleum engineering models.  The concept of two separate air-water
   interfaces was introduced:  (1) the ``zero air saturatution
   interface,{''} which indicates the physical boundary of air
   discontinuity, and (2) the ``zero capillary pressure interface,{''}
   defined as the upper boundary of a zero capillary pressure zone.  A
   method for the numerical tracking of the two interfaces, necessary for
   the evaluation of the effectiveness of secondary water recovery, was
   also developed.}},

   unsaturated zones, confining top layers, high ratio of

   high irreducible air saturations, i.e., clayey textures.  Injection at
   the top of the unsaturated zone, venting the well to the atmosphere
   immediately after the end of air injection, low-to-moderate injection
   rates and large volumes of injected air seemed to enhance water
   recovery.  Simulated water recovery volumes were significantly lower
   than the recovery estimates based on water level elevations in

   of the observations made during the field tests of secondary water
   recovery and helped identify areas of inadequacy in available

Abstract = {{A statistical analysis was undertaken to determine the nature and
   magnitude of the relationship of precipitation, temperature and
   streamflow in the western United States to large-scale atmospheric
   circulation patterns.  The Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was used as
   an indicator of the E1 Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the PNA
   index as an indicator of the Pacific/North America pattern.  These
   indices were correlated with surface climate data and split sample
   analyses were conducted to determine climate response during the extreme
   phases of each index.  October-March precipitation was shown to be most
   strongly correlated with SOI averaged over the July-November period. 
   The analysis showed that there are two centers of opposite association
   with the SOI.  During low values of the SOI (ENSO events) precipitation
   is low in the Pacific northwest and high in the desert southwest. 
   Correlations between SOI and temperature were greatest in the Pacific
   northwest.  The split sample analysis also revealed statistically
   significant differences in precipitation occurring during extremes of
   the SOI.  The PNA pattern was related to precipitation and temperature
   over a concurrent time period.  Especially strong associations were
   noted in the Pacific northwest for both precipitation and temperature. 
   Streamflow showed associations with SOI similar to precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional pumping test analysis methodology assumes that aquifer
   transmissivity is invariant in space.  The ramifications of this
   assumption are examined for hypothetical units whose variations in
   transmissivity are considered to be reasonable representations of
   variations possible in natural systems.  The dependence of pumping test
   transmissivity on spatial (angular and radial) and temporal location of
   observations and the method of drawdown analysis is assessed.  The
   dependence on the angular position of an observation well appears of
   little significance.  Dependence on radial position, however, can be
   strong.  The dependence on the interval of time used in the pumping test
   analysis is only important in highly variable systems.  Methods of
   drawdown analysis that yield identical estimates in uniform units yield
   differing estimates in nonuniform ones as a result of a difference in
   data-fitting procedures.  A reasonable estimate of transmissivity at a
   regional scale can be obtained from a Cooper-Jacob analysis applied at a
   large duration of pumpage.  In general, conventional approaches for
   pumping test analysis should be viable in the nonuniform quifers of the
   type considered here.}},

   workable and practical method in terms of a penalty function principle
   and orthogonal expansion was developed, which involves an extension of
   the classical least squares solution to include a penalty function with
   arbitrarily defined weights which are adjusted to ensure that the
   constraints are satisfied.  A total of nine basins across a range of
   climates and catchment areas in China were selected for examination of
   both daily and hourly rainfall-runoff forecasting.  It was found that
   the method described in this paper can provide a more reasonable and
   robust response function where hydrologic constraints are required.  The
   nonlinear model yields a better streamflow forecasting than the linear
   model, particularly in peak flows.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1975 and 1987 the water yield from three small, contiguous,
   forested catchments carrying similar vegetation in southeastern
   Australia was measured.  These were located in humid, steep foothill
   areas subject to a major plantation program.  At the project start all
   catchments carried mature, natural eucalypt forest.  In their natural
   state the catchments exhibited similar annual hydrologic variation and
   water yields, with a pronounced low-flow period in summer and autumn,
   and high flows in winter and spring.  One catchment was converted from
   native eucalypt forest to radiata pine by clearing, burning, and
   planting in December 1979.  A 30-m buffer was retained along the stream.
   The treatment increased the water yield of the catchment by up to 3.5 ML
   ha-1, a 47\% increase on average.  The actual yield increase varied from
   year to year, and appeared to decline slowly with time from the
   conversion.  Most of the increase was as increased storm flow in the
   early part of winter.  The relation between the storm flow, causal
   rainfall, and antecedent flow did not appear to be changed by the
   treatment, suggesting that most of the storm flow response is
   attributable to increased catchment wetness at the end of the dry summer
   period.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model is presented for defining the size and cross
   section of self-formed straight sand rivers in which sediments are
   actively transported everywhere as bedload and suspended load.  A
   balance of lateral bedload and lateral diffusive transport of suspended
   sediment is imposed to maintain a stable channel cross section. 
   Singular perturbation technique is employed to solve the sediment
   balance equation, from which a relation for stable depth is derived.  A
   resistance formula for dune-covered beds is used to obtain stable width.
   It is revealed theoretically that the channel center depth relative to
   sediment size is approximately proportional to S-0.8 for natural sand
   rivers, in which S is longitudinal slope.  The analysis is found to
   agree reasonably well with available laboratory and field data.}},

Abstract = {{A finite element model has been developed to simulate solute transport
   in tile-drained soil-aquifer systems.  Water flow in the unsaturated
   zone and to drains in the saturated zone was assumed to be at steady
   state.  The model considers the transport of nonreactive solutes, as
   well as of reactive solutes whose behavior can be described by a
   distribution coefficient.  The exact-in-time numerical solution yields
   explicit expressions for the concentration field at any future point in
   time without having to compute concentrations at intermediate times. 
   The semidiscrete method involves the determination of an eigensystem of
   eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coefficient matrix.  The eigensystem
   may be complex (i.e., it may have imaginary components) due to asymmetry
   created by the convection term in the governing convection-dispersion
   equation.  The proposed approach facilitates long-term predictions of
   concentrations in drainage effluents and of salt distributions in soil
   and groundwater.  The accuracy of the model was verified by comparing
   model results with those based on an analytical solution for
   two-dimensional solute transport in groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{A model is presented for calculating the distributions of velocity and
   boundary shear stress across irregular straight open channels.  A
   turbulent kinetic enery transport equation and a two-dimensional ramp
   function for the turbulent length scale provide turbulence closure.  A
   modified sigma transformation maps the channel cross section onto a
   rectangular domain; the transformed equations are solved by a simple
   finite difference algorithm.  Velocity profiles generated by the model
   are logarithmic close to the bed, but in the core of the flow, predicted
   velocities follow a wake profile similar to that observed
   experimentally.  The boundary shear stresses calculated by the model for
   smooth one-dimensional flows are accurate to within 0.02\%.  The model
   also reproduces flow and boundary shear stress data for smooth
   rectangular and trapezoidal laboratory channels; the average boundary
   shear stress is calculated to within about 1\%, and the distributions of
   velocity and shear stress are similar to those obtained from laboratory
   measurements.  Local errors are caused by ignoring weak secondary
   currents and by using a simplistic symmetry assumption for the boundary
   condition at the water's surface.  The model overestimates the discharge
   by an average of 8\%; this error probably occurs because the model
   ignores the resistance due to secondary currents.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic algorithm is a search procedure based on the mechanics of
   natural selection and natural genetics, which combines an artificial
   survival of the fittest with genetic operators abstracted from nature. 
   In this paper, a genetic algorithm for function optimization is
   introduced and applied to calibration of a conceptual rainfall-runoff
   model for data from a particular catchment.  All seven parameters of the
   model are optimized.  The results show that the genetic algorithm can be
   efficient and robust.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments on dispersion of miscible fluids in a porous
   medium have been performed.  Dimensionally scaled two-dimensional models
   were packed with both homogeneous and idealized heterogeneous
   permeability distributions.  Longitudinal dispersion coefficients were
   calculated by mapping the flow into the streamline-equipotential
   coordinate system.  The results of these experiments indicate that the
   dispersion coefficient is not a function of the spatial scale of the
   system provided that the permeability distribution is preserved as the
   system dimension is increased.  Also, it was found that an inclusion of
   permeability differing from the surrounding medium could result in both
   Gaussian and non-Gaussian tracer distributions depending upon the
   location of the inclusion, and systems with heterogeneous permeability
   distributions sometimes resulted in dispersion similar to that for
   homogeneous media.  In some instances, the dispersion everywhere within
   the system appeared to be Fickian, but when the dispersion was monitored
   at the withdrawal point from the system, the dispersion appeared to be
   non-Fickian.}},

Abstract = {{In studies that develop sediment budgets, one or more terms
   (constituting up to 94\% of the total budget) have been obtained by
   subtraction.  These unmeasured residual terms incorporate not only the
   sediment budget components attributed to them, but also the net sum of
   all errors in measured components.  Thus, budgets may appear to balance
   only because errors are hidden in the residual term.  The nature of
   sediment measurements is such that some error is virtually certain, and
   in sediment budget studies where all terms have been quantified,
   imbalances range as high as 104\% of total basin yield.  Despite these
   potential problems, the process of constructing the budget is still
   informative (even when terms are obtained as residuals), because it
   requires sediment sources and transport pathways to be identified and
   quantified.  However, terms obtained by subtraction should be clearly
   identified as such, and where possible, error analysis of all terms
   should be included.}},

   then fall as flow continued to increase.  Optimum flows for scenic
   beauty typically occur for two short periods each year, during the
   ascending and descending portions of the annual late spring peak runoff

Abstract = {{Recent experimental and theoretical investigations of transport in
   fractures indicate that water flows preferentially through channels in
   the fracture plane.  This channeling of flow may imply that solutes
   transported in large-aperture channels have limited exposure to the bulk
   of the rock matrix surface which contacts the fracture.  We present a
   solute transport model for large-aperture channels that includes both
   mass transfer to small-aperture regions of the fracture and the adjacent
   rock matrix to investigate the interaction of solute in large-aperture
   channels with the surrounding rock mass.  Modeling channels similar to
   those observed in the crystalline rock at the Stripa mine show that
   solute can be retarded considerably due to mass exchange between the
   channels, the small-aperture regions of the fracture, and the rock
   matrix.  The extent of solute retardation is insensitive to the solute
   capacity in the small-aperture regions and the areal spacing between
   channels in the fracture plane but is very sensitive to the mass
   transfer rates between the channel and the small-aperture region.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical solution was used to calculate vertical infiltration of
   rainfall into a periodic layered profile of an infinite uniform slope. 
   The calculated pressure-head distribution within the profile was then
   used to evaluate transient unsaturated lateral flow in the slope which
   is not limited to the existence of an impervious barrier.  Because of
   the pressure-line distribution within the layers, the horizontal
   component of the lateral flow changes direction from one layer to
   another.  As a result, the net discharge across the profile can be
   directed upstream during the initial stages of infiltration into a
   relatively dry profile.  Over longer times it is always directed
   downstream, and its value is proportional to the slope.  This indicates
   that the layered soil profile behaves as an anisotropy media on the
   point scales and on the average.  For a two-periodic layered profile the
   total volume that passes in the direction parallel to the slope is very
   nearly proportional to the square of the total rainfall, and it is
   represented versus the accumulated rainwater by one curve for all
   rainfall intensities.  Thus the total rainfall is controlling the rate
   of lateral flow rather than the rainfall intensity.  The thickness of
   the soil layers has only a secondary effect on lateral flow.  The net
   volume that moves horizontally is a potential source for water
   accumulation at concave parts of a regular slope.  This water
   accumulation can form saturated or near-saturated wedges that may
   contribute to surface-runoff generation at these partial areas for cases
   of low rainfall intensities and short ponding times.  These wet zones of
   the hillslope may also contribute massive recharge of water and
   chemicals (if exist) to groundwater in narrow columns.}},

Abstract = {{The magnitude, position, and timing of the instantaneous maximum
   boundary shear stress caused by a raindrop on a shallow pool of water
   are investigated using a series of computer simulation experiments in
   which the Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically. A dimensional
   analysis defines a set of parameters involving fluid properties and
   initial conditions relevant to the problem. Numerical simulations are
   performed over ranges of these parameters using a generic,
   two-dimensional, incompressible, free surface flow model. Results of the
   simulations are summarized in simple algebraic relationships which serve
   to clarify the relative importance of the parameters. The algebraic
   relationships also serve as an efficient substitute for the numerical
   model in the estimation of the magnitude, position, and timing of the
   maximum boundary shear stress. Laboratory measurements of
   water-droplet-induced shear stress are used to demonstrate the validity
   of the algebraic relationships.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1827-1836}},

Abstract = {{Seventy-three overland flow experiments were performed on eight runoff
   plots located on a gentle piedmont hillslope in Walnut Gulch
   Experimental Watershed, southern Arizona.  These plots were sited on
   gravel-covered desert pavement surfaces where overland flow occurs
   during natural rainstorms.  Multiple regression analyses indicate that
   the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor ff can be well predicted by the
   Reynolds number and gravel concentration and size, with gravel
   concentration being by far the single best predictor.  Grain resistance
   ff, calculated using Savat's algorithm, is found to be typically less
   than 10\% of ff.  Given that sediment transport capacity is controlled
   by grain shear stress tau' rather than total shear stress tau and that
   the ratio of tau' to tau is the same as that of ff' to ff, sediment
   transport modeling on the gravel-covered hillslope under study must be
   based on tau' rather than tau to avoid gross overestimation of transport
   capacity.  This conclusion is relevant to all gravel-covered desert
   hillslopes and probably also to most humid hillslopes and agricultural
   lands where plant stems, litter, and tilled surfaces replace gravel as
   sources of form resistance and ensure that grain resistance remains
   relatively small.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of climatic warming on lakes will most likely have serious
   implications for water resources and water quality. Rather than using
   model predictions of greenhouse warming, this paper looks at the changes
   in heat balance and temperature profiles in a particularly warm year
   (1988) compared to a more normal one (1971). The comparisons are made
   for three different morphometrically different lakes located
   45-degrees-N latitude and 93-degrees-W longitude (north central United
   States) and for the summer period (April 1 to October 31). Water
   temperatures are daily values simulated with a model driven by daily
   weather parameters and verified against several sets of measurements.
   The results show that in the warmer year epilimnetic water temperatures
   were higher, evaporative water loss increased, and summer stratification
   occurred earlier in the season.}},

Abstract = {{In currently applied theory of unsaturated flow, paradoxes exist
   concerning the equation of state for the water phase, the idea of a
   water phase at negative absolute pressure, the applicability of the
   hydrostatic pressure gradient at equilibrium, and the lack of explicit
   inclusion of interface effects in the problem formulation.  The theory
   of unsaturated flow presented here eliminates those paradoxes and
   indicates that the hysteresis in capillary pressure and relative
   permeability may be accounted for by allowing these quantities to depend
   on interfacial area as well as saturation.  The wettability potential is
   shown to be a thermodynamic function which is important in describing
   unsaturated flow processes.  The momentum balance equation for the
   interface between the air and water phases also contributes to a
   systematic and tractable set of equations which describe unsaturated
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies have attempted to examine explicitly the factors that
   produce variation in hydraulic geometry parameters.  A continuously
   varying parameter model of downstream hydraulic geometry is formulated
   to address this issue.  Parameter variation is viewed as a function of
   channel sediment characteristics and flood magnitude.  Results for the
   Missouri River basin show that these factors are strongly associated
   with variation in hydraulic geometry coefficients and exponents.  The
   results also indicate that bivariate relationships are biased by these
   associations.  The analysis yields site-specific parameters that
   uniquely describe the relationship between active channel form and mean
   discharge at a particular location within the basin.  The continuously
   varying parameter approach has several advantages:  (1) it isolates the
   separate influences of each explanatory variable on each hydraulic
   geometry parameter, (2) it maintains the precision of parameter
   estimates by including the entire data set in the analysis, and (3) it
   allows testing of the conception that hydraulic geometry parameters vary
   continuously rather than discretely, yet permits analysis of discrete
   change through the use of dummy variables.}},

Abstract = {{A new numerical method, the Laplace transform finite difference (LTFD)
   method, was developed to solve the partial differential equation (PDE)
   of transient flow through porous media.  LTFD provides a solution which
   is semianalytical in time and numerical in space by solving the
   discretized PDE in the Laplace space and numerically inverting the
   transformed solution vector.  The effects of the traditional treatment
   of the time derivative on accuracy and stability are rendered irrelevant
   because time is no longer a consideration.  For a single time step, LTFD
   requires no more than eight matrix solutions and and execution time
   eight times longer than the analogous finite difference (FD) requirement
   without an increase in storage.  This disadvantage is outweighed by an
   unlimited time step size without any loss of accuracy, a superior
   accuracy, and a stable, nonincreasing round off error.  Thus, a problem
   in standard FD format may require several hundred time steps and matrix
   inversions between the initial condition and the desired solution time,
   but LTFD requires only one time step and no more than eight matrix
   inversions to achieve a more accurate result.}},

Abstract = {{The three flow processes occurring on hillslopes (overland flows,
   streamflows, and subsurface saturated-unsaturated flows) are in dynamic
   equilibrium and interact continuously through their common boundaries. 
   A physics-based, deterministic, distributed model incorporating internal
   coupling of the three components is developed to study the extent and
   location of saturated regions neighboring the streams.  These saturated
   zones develop overland flow and are very responsive to rainfall and are
   therefore important contributors to the hillslope hydrograph.  Using a
   wide channel which drains the water from the side hillslopes (resembling
   an open book) for a physical section, we study the response of these
   variable source areas (VSAs) to various hydrologic and topographic
   parameters.  An infiltrating boundary condition, which allows for both
   the Horton and Dunne mechanisms of overland flow generation, is
   incorporated in the analysis.  It is observed that the dynamic modeling
   of the VSAs is useful for determining the hillslope hydrograph
   properties.}},

   between these prolonged runs of above or below average conditions. A
   statistical-dynamical model is developed to represent the surface
   hydrology of large continental regions. The model has physically based
   components, and it includes a parameterization for the local recycling
   of precipitation. It is shown that stochastic fluctuations in this
   equation may give rise to separate and distinct statistical modes with
   noise-induced transitions between these modes. In an example situation
   the characteristic long-term probability distribution of soil moisture

Abstract = {{The stable isotope composition of water (delta-D and delta-18-O) and
   chloride concentrations were measured monthly at 26 stations along the
   River Murray, Australia and several major tributaries from December 1988
   to June 1989.  The first four months had low natural runoff plus large
   irrigation diversions from storage reservoirs.  The following three
   months had much higher (up to a factor of 5) river discharge.  Deuterium
   and oxygen 18 compositions had a maximum range of 50 parts per thousand
   and 9 parts per thousand, respectively, from headwaters to mouth. 
   Chloride concentrations increased downstream with a maximum range from 1
   to 180 x 10(-3) kg m-3.  These trends can be attributed to (1)
   evaporation from storage facilities and river channels, (2) inflows of
   irrigation drainage water enriched in heavy isotopes, and (3) inflows of
   saline groundwater.  Water losses by evaporation from the river surface
   and irrigation areas amounted to about 40 +/- 15\% of releases from
   reservoir storage, based on the integrated enrichment of deuterium,
   which is comparable to the total transpiration flux within the basin. 
   About half of the chloride acquired by the Murray as it traversed the
   middle third of the basin during summer months appears to have resulted
   from return flows of irrigation drainage water.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The parallel fissure model coupled with the equation of diffusion into
   the matrix and with exchange reaction equations has been used to derive
   a simple formula for estimating the influence of matrix porosity and
   reaction parameters on the determination of radiocarbon ages in fissured
   carbonate rocks.  Examples of evidently too great radiocarbon ages in
   carbonate formations, which are not explainable by models for the
   initial C-14 corrections, can easily be explained by this formula. 
   Parameters obtained for a chalk formation from a known multitracer
   experiment combined with a pumping test suggest a possibility of C-14
   ages more than three orders of magnitude greater than the ages which
   would be observed if the radiocarbon transport took place only in the
   mobile water in the fissures.  It is shown that contrary to the solute
   movement on a small scale and with a variable input, the large-scale
   movement, characteristic for the C-14 dating, does not necessarily
   require the knowledge of kinetic parameters, because they may be
   replaced by the distribution coefficient.  Discordant tritium and C-14
   concentrations are commonly interpreted as a proof of mixing either in
   the aquifer or at the discharge site.  For fissured carbonate
   formations, however, an alternative explanation is given by the derived
   model showing a considerable delay of C-14 with respect to nonsorbable
   tracers.}},

Abstract = {{As water infiltrates downward into an air-filled, water wettable porous
   medium, the wetting front which forms may become unstable and allow the
   formation of downward moving fingers within the vadose zone.  In this
   paper we first review stability criteria and estimated finger widths
   determined from linear stability theory in two-dimensional systems.  Two
   approaches reported in the literature which employ different
   formulations for the interfacial boundary conditions, yield different
   estimates of the finger width.  We extend the analyses to investigate
   finger diameter in three-dimensional systems by considering axisymmetric
   disturbances.  Results of the three-dimensional analyses are illustrated
   through comparison to previously reported experimental results in
   three-dimensional systems.  Because either approach gives similar
   results for low system fluxes, in practice, it probably will not matter
   which formulation is used.  However, one approach represents the data
   better and contains only traditionally measured porous media properties.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation models for calculating moisture deficits for areas of land
   require interpolation procedures to arrive from point observations to
   area-covering statements.  We use both (1) calculate first, interpolate

   test locations, and (2) procedures which interpolate basic soil data
   toward test locations, followed by model calculations, interpolate
   first, calculate later (IC) procedures.  In this study several CI and IC
   procedures which simulate moisture deficits are compared by means of a
   test set of 100 observations, yielding the mean standard error (MSE). 
   CI procedures consistently produced lower MSE values than IC procedures.
   Parameters of the pseudocovariance function (PCF), which models the
   spatial structure of bivariate increments in universal cokriging, were
   estimated by means of the restricted maximum likelihood procedure. 
   Compared to universal kriging, universal cokriging yielded comparable
   MSE values, but a lower mean variance of the prediction error.  Best
   results in this study were obtained by pointwise simulation model
   calculations, followed by statistical interpolations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the feasibility of using C-14 in dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) as an alternative isotopic groundwater dating method.  Two
   hydrogeologically contrasting groundwater systems were tested; the
   Cretaceous age Milk River aquifer, and low-permeability, organic rich,
   Wisconsinan age Prairie tills in southern Alberta, Canada.  Comparisons
   of radiocarbon data were made between DOC fractions, dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC), and several DIC geochemical age correction models along
   well defined flow paths.  The data presented demonstrate that C-14
   dating of DOC fractions can indeed provide an alternative method for
   determining isotopic groundwater ages, under suitable conditions. 
   However, detailed information may be required regarding (1) the geologic
   nature of the aquifer and its flow system, (2) the isotopically
   conservative behavior of DOC, (3) the initial C-14 activity of DOC in
   recharge, and (4) the effect of bacterial redox processes on the C-14
   activity of DOC.  In the Milk River aquifer, DOC C-14 ages were
   successfully used to estimate groundwater residence times, as well as to
   further refine input parameter assumptions for the DIC method.  In the
   Prairie tills, DOC C-14 ages were used to establish a maximum age for
   the pore waters in an environment where the DIC method is especially
   problematic.}},

Abstract = {{Deterministic models are widely used to describe the behavior of the
   hydraulic head in time and space. It would be useful to know the
   uncertainty of these approximations of reality, what data on groundwater
   head they require and whether these data can be used to improve the
   model's performance after calibration/validation. Therefore the use of a
   Kalman filter algorithm for assessing the uncertainty of a deterministic
   groundwater model is described. It is suggested that the strength of the
   Kalman filter is that it makes good use of the available information to
   assess uncertainty and to improve model performance. This has
   implications for applications such as the analysis and design of
   groundwater networks and on-line groundwater management. After briefly
   describing how to combine a Kalman filter with a deterministic
   groundwater model, some important aspects like quantifying the system
   noise statistics and calibrating these values are emphasized. These
   aspects are illustrated using a one-dimensional hypothetical example of
   a groundwater system.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating Kalman filtering and a deterministic groundwater flow model
   not only improves and quantifies the uncertainty of numerical
   groundwater simulation, but also provides the dynamic relation between
   the variance of the estimation error and the measurement strategy.  This
   relation is applied to Zhengzhou city and Spannenburg for the analysis
   and design of networks for monitoring groundwater levels.  For both
   cases, the network is designed in such a way that the network density is
   minimized under the constraint of given threshold values for the
   standard deviations of the estimation errors.  Several network
   alternatives are analyzed and a best alternative is selected by trial
   and error.  In the case of Zhengzhou city, much attention is also paid
   to the sensitivity analysis of the deterministic and stochastic
   parameters of the standard deviation of the estimation error.  The
   results indicate that the density of the network depends on the
   characteristics of geohydrological systems.  The Zhengzhou city and
   Spannenburg cases are compared and the difference between them is
   discussed using a hypothetical example.  It is found that the difference
   in the behavior of the estimation variance in time is attributable to
   the characteristic response time of the system on which the network
   density and observation frequency depend.}},

Abstract = {{We present analysis and interpretation of experimental data collected in
   two natural-gradient dispersion tests over distances of 40 and 260 m,
   respectively.  In the 40-m test, the use of a gamma-emitting tracer
   (I-131) and a dry-access-well monitoring technique provided 1-cm
   resolution of the vertical concentration distribution.  This in turn
   provided an opportunity to calculate dispersion coefficients at the
   local-scale for individual layers.  In the 260-m test, the use of a
   beta-emitting tracer (H-3) and multilevel sampling devices with 1-m
   vertical spacing did not allow the identification of individual layers. 
   The local-scale longitudinal dispersivities, which may be only
   calculated at large distances from the injection well at monitors
   located next to the trajectory of the plume centroid, were similar to
   those calculated in the 40-m test for individual layers.  Tritium data
   were also averaged over the cross section perpendicular to the mean
   direction of flow and the obtained plume-scale concentration time data
   were used for calculating the coefficient of longitudinal dispersion. 
   There is an order of magnitude difference between plume-scale and
   local-scale longitudinal dispersivities.  The local-scale velocities
   were used to perform transformation of observed concentration time data
   into concentration distance data.  The latter were used to calculate
   plume-scale dispersivities using moments analysis.  The plume-scale
   dispersivities calculated for the vertically averaged data were used for
   predictive purposes.  It was found that the vertically averaged data for
   tracer distribution are poorly described by the two-dimensional solution
   to the advection-dispersion equation with constant coefficients
   determined from the moments analysis.}},

Title = {{NITRATE REDUCTION IN AN UNCONFINED SANDY AQUIFER - WATER CHEMISTRY,
   REDUCTION PROCESSES, AND GEOCHEMICAL MODELING}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate distribution and reduction processes were investigated in an
   unconfined sandy aquifer of Quaternary age.  Groundwater chemistry was
   studied in a series of eight multilevel samplers along a flow line,
   deriving water from both arable and forested land.  Results show that
   plumes of nitrate-contaminated groundwater emanate from the agricultural
   areas and spread through the aquifer.  The aquifer can be subdivided
   into an upper 10- to 15-m thick oxic zone that contains O2 and NO3-, and
   a lower anoxic zone characterized by Fe2+-rich waters.  The redox
   boundary is very sharp, which suggests that reduction processes of O2
   and NO3- occur at rates that are fast compared to the rate of downward
   water transport.  Nitrate-contaminated groundwater contains total
   contents of dissolved ions that are two to four times higher than in
   groundwater derived from the forested area.  The persistence of the high
   content of total dissolved ions in the NO3- free anoxic zone indicates
   the downward migration of contaminants and that active nitrate reduction
   is taking place.  Nitrate is apparently reduced to N2 because both
   nitrite and ammonia are absent or found at very low concentrations. 
   Possible electron donors in the reduced zone of the aquifer are organic
   matter, present as reworked brown coal fragments from the underlying
   Miocene, and small amounts of pyrite at an average concentration of 3.6
   mmol/kg.  Electron balances across the redoxcline, based on
   concentrations of O2, NO3-, SO4(2-) and total inorganic carbon (TIC),
   indicate that pyrite is by far the dominant electron donor even though
   organic matter is much more abundant.  Groundwater transport and
   chemical reactions were modeled using the code PHREEQM, which combines a
   chemical equilibrium model with a one-dimensional mixing cell transport
   model.  Only the vertical component of the water transport was modeled
   since, in contrast to rates along flow lines, the vertical rates are
   close to constant as required by the one-dimensional model.  Average
   vertical transport rates of water in the saturated zone were obtained by
   tritium dating.  The modeling process is a two-step procedure.  First
   the sediment column is initialized with natural water containing only
   oxygen as electron acceptor, and subsequently agricultural waters
   containing both oxygen and nitrate are fed into the column.  The nitrate
   concentration of agricultural waters entering the saturated zone varies
   with time, and an input function was therefore constructed by linear
   mixing of natural waters and agricultural waters.  This input function
   was fed into the column initialized with natural water, and the model
   run forward in time to the year 1988 where field data are available. 
   Comparison with field data shows that the variation in groundwater
   chemistry is well described by the model when reduction of oxygen and
   reduction of nitrate by pyrite oxidation are the only redox reactions
   occurring.  Finally, predictions are made for the distribution of water
   chemistry in the year 2003.  Downward progression of the redoxcline is
   accelerated by a factor of five due to nitrate pollution of the aquifer,
   but absolute rates remain small, of the order of a few centimeters per
   year.
   The controlling factor for nitrate migration through the aquifer, once
   it has reached the anoxic zone, is the concentration and distribution of
   pyrite in the sediments.}},

Abstract = {{The Ned Wilson Lake watershed responds directly and rapidly to changes
   in precipitation inputs of sulfate, which has important implications for
   effects of acid deposition on the aquatic system.  Chemistry at three
   precipitation collection sites and three watershed sites (a pond, a
   lake, and a spring) has been monitored in and near the Flattops
   Wilderness Area in northwestern Colorado beginning in 1981-1983.  Bulk
   snowpack concentration of sulfate in the watershed and volume-weighted
   annual mean concentration of sulfate in precipitation at two nearby
   sites generally decreased from 1981 to 1985, were small through 1987,
   and increased in 1988-1989.  Changes in concentration of sulfate at the
   watershed sites are controlled by precipitation inputs.  Responsiveness
   of the individual sites was dependent on their position along the
   hydrologic flow path.  The fastest response was in the pond, which has a
   hydrologic residence time of less than 1 year; over 90\% of the variance
   in concentration of sulfate in the pond was explained by changes in
   concentration in precipitation.  The lake has a hydrologic residence
   time of 1 to 4 years; a regression model of the concentration of sulfate
   in the lake, as a function of the concentration in the lake during the
   previous year and the concentration in precipitation, explained 87\% of
   the variance in concentration of sulfate in the lake.  The hydrologic
   response time of the spring is unknown; it was not responsive to changes
   in concentration of sulfate in precipitation.  The recent increase of
   sulfate concentration in precipitation and in the pond and lake is
   evidence for a rapid rather than a delayed response, which could not be
   determined when only a decreasing trend in sulfate concentration was
   reported in 1982-1987.  Watersheds of this type are sensitive to
   acidification (acid-neutralizing capacity less than 60-mu-eq L-1), and
   these results indicate conservative behavior of sulfate.  This is
   important in predicting effects of future changes in atmospheric
   deposition, which could potentially be caused by anthropogenic emissions
   or climatic change.}},

Abstract = {{Both porous medium heterogeneities and fluid density and viscosity
   contrasts affect solute transport in miscible fluid displacement.  The
   effects of interaction of these processes on large-scale mixing are
   evaluated using spectral-based perturbation theory.  A
   three-dimensional, statistically isotropic, exponential log permeability
   autocovariance is used to represent the spatial variability of the
   porous medium.  State equations linearly relating log density and log
   viscosity perturbations to concentration perturbations represent the
   density and viscosity variability and strongly couple the flow and
   solute transport perturbation equations.  Analytical expressions for
   longitudinal macrodispersivity, derived for one-dimensional mean solute
   transport, are functionally dependent on mean displacement distance,
   mean concentration and concentration gradient, density and viscosity
   differences, mean velocity, gravity, and correlation scale and variance
   of the log permeability process.  Transient analysis shows that
   longitudinal macrodispersivity grows exponentially in time (or mean
   displacement distance) without bound for the case where instabilities
   due to viscous or gravity fingering arise (the ``unstable{''} or
   ``fingering{''} case) and that it grows at early time then decreases
   exponentially to an asymptotic value close to that of local dispersivity
   for the case where density or viscosity contrasts produce a stabilizing
   effect (the ``stable{''} case).}},

Abstract = {{In groundwater management, uncertainty mainly stems from imprecise
   parameters and boundary conditions.  This paper first formulates a
   stochastic groundwater management problem and subsequently proposes an
   appropriate solution approach.  The equations of flow are converted to a
   dynamical state-space system using finite element and difference
   techniques.  Parameter and boundary condition uncertainty is
   incorporated using the small perturbation method.  Management objectives
   are expressed as a composite performance index which may be used to
   minimize pumping costs, maintain hydraulic heads and pumping rates in
   the vicinity of target sequences, or optimally compromise among various
   system goals.  This problem is solved via a numerical optimal control
   method which exhibits good computational properties.  The approach is
   applied to the management of a two-layer aquifer system with various
   boundary conditions and uncertainty levels and sources.  The results
   provide useful insights of the system response under uncertainty and
   quantify the trade-offs between accomplishing average system goals and
   minimizing uncertainty.}},

   major flow periods:  (1) at early time, the frontal position is
   determined by the fracture inlet boundary condition and the
   gravity-driven flow behavior of the fracture with negligible influence
   by the matrix; (2) at intermediate time, matrix imbibition retards the
   frontal advance against the pull of gravity; (3) at late time, the
   matrix approaches saturation and the frontal velocity approaches a
   limiting value.  A two-dimensional numerical model is used to confirm
   the approximate solutions.  Implications of the model for nuclear waste
   storage are discussed.  The analysis is applicable not only to fractured
   rock but also to lateral infiltration into coarse-grained sediments
   lying between layers of fine-grained soil.}},

Abstract = {{A hysteretic model for two-phase permeability (k)-saturation
   (S)-pressure (P) relations is outlined that accounts for effects of
   nonwetting fluid entrapment. The model can be employed in unsaturated
   fluid flow computer codes to predict temporal and spatial fluid
   distributions. Consideration is given to hysteresis in S-P relations
   caused by contact angle, irregular pore geometry, and nonwetting fluid
   entrapment effects and to hysteresis in k-S relations caused by
   nonwetting fluid entrapment effects. An air-water flow experiment is
   conducted with a 72-cm vertical soil column where the water table is
   fluctuated to generate scanning S-P paths. Water contents are measured
   via a gamma radiation system, and water pressures are measured via
   pressure transducers connected to ceramic tensiometers inserted in the
   soil column. Computer simulations of the experiment employing the
   hysteretic k-S-P model and a nonhysteretic k-S-P are compared with
   measured water contents and pressures. Close agreement is found between
   experimental water contents and those predicted by a numerical code
   employing the hysteretic k-S-P relations. When nonhysteretic k-S-P
   constitutive relations are utilized, there is poor agreement between
   measured and predicted water saturations of the scanning paths. Only one
   more parameter is needed to model two-phase hysteretic fluid behavior
   than to model nonhysteretic behavior. Results of this study suggest that
   consideration should be given to effects of hysteresis in k-S-P
   relations to accurately predict fluid distributions.}},

Abstract = {{The rates and processes of erosion and deposition of soils and sediments
   are subjects of widespread and increasing concern in the Earth and
   environmental sciences.  Process inference from field studies, however,
   has been hampered by a lack of information on the precise magnitude,
   frequency and timing of erosional and depositional activity, because no
   automatic monitoring technique has hitherto been available.  I describe
   here an automatic Photo-Electronic Erosion Pin (PEEP) system which,
   apparently for the first time, allows quasi-continuous time series of
   erosion and deposition data to be collected.  Example results from a
   river bank site show how the PEEP system helps to define the true
   temporal distribution of geomorphological change, quantify the erosional
   impact of individual forcing events, and discriminate between competing
   hypotheses of process control in erosional and depositional contexts. 
   The system should thus allow more effective testing of erosion models of
   high temporal resolution and facilitate a more rigorous linking of
   catchment sediment output to supply dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison between solute travel times predicted by a transient and a
   steady state flow model is made.  Data for five different soil profiles
   with detailed measurements of their hydraulic properties and their
   variation with depth are used.  Daily measurements of meteorological
   data are used as input parameters in the transient simulations that
   include snow and frost dynamics, interception of precipitation, and
   evapotranspiration.  The parameters of the steady state flow model are
   related to the measured soil properties and the hydrological
   characteristics of each transient simulation.  Furthermore, the
   influence of solute injection time on the predicted travel time is
   analyzed, and the effect of root water uptake on the applicability of
   the steady state flow assumption for solute advection is investigated. 
   The results indicate that the steady state flow model may provide
   estimates of the mean solute advection that are compatible with those of
   the transient flow model.  The constant rate of recharge in the steady
   state flow model should then be interpreted as the average annual
   effective infiltration (i.e., infiltration minus actual
   evapotranspiration).  When root water uptake is accounted for, an
   arithmetic depth-averaging of the soil parameters appears to yield
   steady state estimates of arrival time that are closest to the transient
   predictions.  When root water uptake is neglected, a harmonic
   depth-averaging of the soil parameters provides the best steady state
   results.  The discrepancy between the arrival times predicted with the
   two flow models decreases with the travel distance from the soil
   surface.}},

Abstract = {{Under certain conditions, when pulse tracer injection tests are
   performed in a single fracture with a regional flow field, the
   breakthrough curves may display multiple peaks.  Furthermore, the shape
   of these curves may change when the injection flow rate is varied.  In
   this paper the conditions under which the breakthrough curve may present
   multiple peaks are analyzed numerically using stochastically generated
   fractures.  The dispersivities of these peaks are also calculated.  It
   is found that the dispersivity is small for each of the peaks and that
   the dispersivities of the different peaks in a breakthrough curve are
   quite similar.  The results presented in this paper may be equally
   applied to tracer tests in a two-dimensional strongly heterogeneous
   medium.}},

Abstract = {{The contingent valuation method (CVM) and travel cost method (TCM),
   recommended by the federal guidelines, are applied to the problem of
   estimating recreational benefits in a case study of rivers in the
   Colorado Rocky Mountains.  The primary purpose is to assess the validity
   of the behavioral intentions reported in CVM surveys compared to actual
   behavior-based TCM analysis.  Comparison of the two approaches has been
   limited by potential measurement problems including variation in the
   valuation question and model specification.  This study evaluates CVM
   questions asking for both trip and annual values, versus TCM models of
   the number of trips per participant with and without adjustment for the
   probability of participation.  Based on this case study, we cannot
   reject the hypothesis that recreation benefits estimated by the
   alternative methods are equal.  Apparently, the ordinary CVM and
   individual TCM can provide as useful an approximation of the
   recreational economic welfare effects of river protection as the
   alternative procedures.}},

   Reliability is improved by increasing pipe size.  The pipe size increase

Abstract = {{The physics of the rainfall infiltration under a constant rainfall flux
   greater than the hydraulic conductivity at saturation are investigated
   and compared with those pertaining to the infiltration process under
   flooding.  From the arguments developed theoretically the following
   conclusions are reached:  The moisture profile prevailing at the time
   the soil surface becomes saturated during the rainfall process (t = T)
   is identical with the profile which has been developed during flooding
   at an earlier time at which the infiltration rate is equal to the
   rainfall flux (t = t(c) < T).  The rainfall profile development after T
   is the same as that of the profile under flooding after T(c), the two
   profiles having a constant time lag equal to (T - t(c)).  The Green and
   Ampt analysis as has been applied to the constant flux rainfall
   infiltration presupposes the identity of the profiles mentioned above. 
   In addition to the theoretical arguments, the flow equation was solved
   numerically for four different soils under the conditions that define
   the two infiltration processes.  The numerical results obtained conform
   with the theory.}},

Abstract = {{Perforated drain tubes have, in many places, supplanted the use of drain
   tiles in drainage from agricultural lands, airports and the like. 
   However, the few existent formulae for predicting drainage rates are
   complex and unwieldy.  In this paper, a formula is derived by using a
   series solution of Laplace's equation and techniques of solution of dual
   trigonometric series, for the rate of water flow into a perforated drain
   tube, showing the effects of such parameters as hole size, number and
   spacing of holes, and drain size and depth.  The formula applies to
   pipes perforamated by small circular holes or by longitudinal slits. 
   Recommendations for the design of perforated pipes are made, based on
   the delivery ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides some useful results for modeling rainfall.  It
   extends work on the Neyman-Scott cluster model for simulating rainfall
   time series.  Several important properties have previously been found
   for the model, for example, the expectation and variance of the amount
   of rain captured in an arbitrary time interval (Rodriguez-Iturbe et al.,
   1987a).  In this paper additional properties are derived, such as the
   probability of an arbitrary interval of any chosen length being dry.  In
   applications this is a desirable property to have, and is often used for
   fitting stochastic rainfall models to field data.  The model is
   currently being used in rainfall time series research directed toward
   improving sewage systems in the United Kingdom.  To illustrate the
   model's performance an example is given, where the model is fitted to 10
   years of hourly data taken from Blackpool, England.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of ``macropore{''} soil water phenomena are calculated from a
   simple stochastic model of infiltration.  Probability density functions
   (pdf) for cumulative infiltration (I), infiltration rate (I'), and
   infiltrating-water flux (upsilon) are proposed.  Cumulative infiltration
   is defined here as the maximum quantity of water the soil can accept
   from unponded water supplied at a given location on the soil surface. 
   Similarly, infiltration rate is defined as the maximum rate at which
   unponded water can enter the soil.  The pdfs for cumulative infiltration
   (f(I)) and infiltration rate (f(I')) are derived by assuming that the
   saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(s)) is a lognormal-distributed
   random variable.  The actual infiltrating-water flux will depend on I',
   rainfall rate (R0), slope, and surface roughness.  For a flat and smooth
   soil surface the pdf for infiltrating-water flux f-upsilon is derived
   from f(I') by assuming that water failing to infiltrate into portions of
   the soil with lower infiltration rates will flow over the soil surface,
   eventually being accepted by areas with higher infiltration rates.  The
   pdf f-upsilon predicts that macropore soil water flow phenomena will
   become more pronounced as the rainfall rate approaches the mean
   infiltration rate, when macropore flux predicted by f-upsilon is many
   times the rainfall rate.  These results indicate that stochastic
   description of soil hydraulic properties shows promise in describing
   macropore soil water phenomena.  Models of the field-scale effects of
   macropore soil water flow should include infiltration rate variability
   and runoff contributions to infiltrating-water flux.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation experiment is used to test the stochastic theory of
   unsaturated flow proposed by Mantoglou and Gelhar (1987a, b, c). 
   Tension means and variances derived from this theory are compared to
   tension distributions obtained from a detailed three-dimensional model
   developed by Ababou (1988).  The synthetically generated unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity functions used in the detailed model vary
   significantly over relatively small distances.  Results from a simulated
   infiltration event indicate that the stochastic theory's predictions
   reproduce the overall trend of the heterogeneous tension distribution. 
   Deviations from the predicted mean generally lie within confidence
   intervals derived from the predicted variance.  The stochastic theory
   predicts less vertical moisture movement and somewhat more horizontal
   spreading than a comparable deterministic analysis.  This reflects the
   fact that the effective hydraulic conductivity function used in the
   stochastic approach is anisotropic.  The magnitude of this anisotropy
   increases with increasing tension.}},

   jump theta-3 to theta-4 (theta-3 > theta-4).  The operative moisture
   potential is the primary drying potential for x < 0, theta-1
   greater-than-or-equal-to theta greater-than-or-equal-to theta-3 and the
   primary wetting potential for x > 0, theta-4 greater-than-or-equal-to
   theta greater-than-or-equal-to theta-2.  The operative moisture
   diffusivity is the primary drying diffusivity for x < 0 and the primary
   wetting diffusivity for x > 0.  The drying diffusivity is greater than
   the wetting diffusivity near theta = theta-1 and less near theta =
   theta-2.  Solutions are found for illustrative examples corresponding to
   four values of H, the relative magnitude of the hysteresis loop.  The
   resorptivity R, the total wet-to-dry exchange of water across x = 0 in
   reduced form, is analogous to the sorptivity S in absorption and
   infiltration.  For the calculated examples, R is about one third of S
   for the corresponding absorption process and varies only mildly with H.
   Nonhysteretic calculations may thus give reasonable estimates of R for
   horizontal hysteretic redistribution, though they cannot give details
   such as the moisture jump at x = 0.  Desorption moisture profiles for x
   < 0 are very gradual, with a large depth of penetration.  Absorption
   profiles for x > 0 are relatively steep, and the penetration depth
   small.  It follows that in experiments the initially wet section of the
   column should be made some 5-10 times longer than the initially dry
   sector.}},

Abstract = {{Four new algorithms are presented to cost-effectively delineate
   displacement fronts and capture zones via particle tracking in complex
   flow fields.  These algorithms include methods of (1) defining path
   lines using ``mixed distance and time particle tracking{''}; (2)
   computing displacement fronts and capture zones using ``dynamic particle
   allocation front tracking,{''} allowing insertion/deletion of particles
   to optimize front definition; (3) obtaining accurate breakthrough curves
   by using simultaneous ``mass redistribution,{''} reallocating particle
   mass among particles defining the displacement front; and (4)
   determining production well breakthrough curves using ``optimized
   sorting algorithms{''} when backward tracking to map capture zones. 
   Examples are shown for capture zones and aquifer remediation
   applications.  Comparisons are made to conventional algorithms.  Results
   show that the number of particles required to define displacement fronts
   and breakthrough curve is a function of time, position, and flow field
   complexity.  Dynamic front tracking results in significant savings of
   storage and computational expense, even for relatively simple velocity
   fields.  A corresponding increase in the accuracy of breakthrough curves
   is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional multiphase mass transport model for the migration of a
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) containing sparingly water soluble
   organics in the unsaturated soil zone is described.  The multiphase NAPL
   transport (MUNT) model consists of a two-phase immiscible flow model
   linked to a four-phase chemical transport model.  The immiscible flow
   model incorporates a front-tracking algorithm to determine the front of
   the invading NAPL as a function of penetration time.  The NAPL
   penetration toward groundwater is shown to be a function of four
   dimensionless groups:  NAPL capillary number, the ratio of the NAPL
   Reynolds number to the NAPL Froude number, and the ratio of the
   defending phase to NAPL phase densities and viscosities.  Simulations
   for the migration of organic chemicals show that their concentration in
   the air and aqueous phases past the front can be significant.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a series of soil water tracer experiments and
   approaches taken to numerically model the flow and transport behavior
   observed in the field experiments.  These experimental and numerical
   results strongly suggest that current widely held views and commonly
   applied modeling approaches are flawed in many cases for unsaturated
   flow, and provide strong supporting evidence for a variable,
   state-dependent anisotropy in the hydraulic conductivity of an
   unsaturated medium.  This phenomenon has been previously postulated in a
   number of independent theoretical and experimental investigations.  In
   general, the previous studies identify layered heterogeneity as a
   primary cause of the macroscopic anisotropy.  In addition, we show how
   hysteresis in the soil moisture characteristics (theta-psi relationship)
   can cause a texturally homogeneous porous media profile to behave
   anisotropically under transient unsaturated conditions.  Recognizing
   that both of these factors (layered heterogeneity and capillary
   hysteresis) contribute the anisotropic behavior observed in the tracer
   experiments, we attempt to quantify the relative magnitude of their
   contributions in a numerical modeling investigation.  For the numerical
   modeling study we use a finite element flow and transport code, and
   introduce a simple procedure for incorporating variable anisotropy into
   a predictive numerical model.  To determine the relative magnitude of
   textural heterogeneity and capillary hysteresis as causes of the
   observed macroscopic anisotropy, we employ a diagnostic modeling
   approach.  The results of the diagnostic modeling study indicate that
   textural heterogeneity is by far the most important contributor to the
   variable macroscopic anisotropy observed at the field site.  The
   diagnostic simulations further show that the variable anisotropy
   approach is well suited to modeling field-scale problems.  Subsequently,
   a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how climate, geologic
   and topographic structure, and media lithology affect flow and transport
   behavior when soils were specified to have a variable macroscopic
   anisotropy.  The results of this study clearly indicate that variable
   state-dependent anisotropy is a real and significant process at the
   field site and that modeling with consideration of variable anisotropy
   strongly affects model predictions.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure for evaluating and selecting among alternative rules for
   operating a municipal water supply system is outlined in this study.  It
   is assumed that monthly water demands and supplies are random.  The
   total cost, however, is affected by both current month and future water
   allocation decisions with respect to the operation of facilities.  A
   perfect foresight model using mixed integer programming is developed and
   applied to 36 years of historical demand and supply data.  Using the
   solutions to this model, several simple operating rules are derived. 
   These rules are applied to the historical data to simulate system
   operation, and cumulative distribution of net revenue for each rule is
   derived.  Based on first- and second-degree stochastic dominance
   criteria, the performance of alternative rules are evaluated.  The
   procedure is also repeated with a set of generated data sequences to
   check the consistency of the solutions.  Average reductions of up to
   11\% in annual net revenues from those of a perfect foresight model are
   observed, for various operating rules.  Using stochastically dominant
   rules, annual revenues can be increased by 5\% on the average from a
   commonly used rule based on unit cost.}},

Abstract = {{The Emerald Lake Watershed study was organized to investigate the
   effects of acidic deposition on high-elevation watersheds and surface
   waters of the Sierra Nevada, California.  Some of the results of this
   comprehensive study of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems at a small,
   headwater basin are presented in four papers in this series.  The
   watershed study site is in Sequoia National Park, on the western slope
   of the Sierra Nevada.  This glacial cirque is located in the upper
   Marble Fork of the Kaweah River.  This 120-ha watershed ranges from Alta
   Peak (3416 m) down to Emerald Lake (2400 m).  Most of the watershed
   surface area is exposed granite and granodiorite rocks, with limited
   coverage (about 20\%) by thin, acidic soils.  The hydrology of the basin
   is dominated by snowmelt runoff during March-June.  Emerald Lake, a
   glacial tarn, is 2.72 ha in area, with a maximum depth of 10.5 m. 
   Surface waters are poorly buffered and dominated by calcium and
   bicarbonate.  Most of the yearly precipitation falls as dilute snow (pH
   5.2-5.4), with acidic rain storms sampled during May-October.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution of snow water equivalence (SWE) was measured in the Emerald
   Lake watershed located in Sequoia National Park, California, by taking
   hundreds of depth measurements and density profiles at six locations
   during the 1986, 1987 and 1988 water years.  A stratified sampling
   scheme was evaluated by identifying and mapping zones of similar snow
   properties on the basis of topographic parameters that account for
   variations in both accumulation and ablation.  Elevation, slope, and
   radiation values calculated from a digital elevation model were used to
   determine the zones.  Of the variables studied, net radiation was of
   primary importance.  Field measurements of SWE were combined with the
   phsyical attributes of the watershed and clustered to identify similar
   classes of SWE.  The entire basin was then partitioned into zones for
   each survey date.  Statistical analysis showed that partitioning the
   watershed on the basis of topographic and radiation variables does
   produce superior results over a simple random sample.}},

Abstract = {{A water balance prepared for the Emerald Lake basin illustrates the
   absolute and relative magnitudes of the main water transfers in this
   alpine catchment in the Sierra Nevada over two water years.  The water
   balance over both years, expressed as equivalent water depths averaged
   over the catchment area, was total precipitation (3670 mm) - total
   losses in the atmosphere (800 mm) = total streamflow (2830 mm) +
   residual (40 mm).  Snow dominated the water balance during the study
   period, accounting for 95\% of the precipitation.  The spring snowmelt
   periods accounted for more than 85\% of the annual streamflow and were
   followed by long recessions through summer, autumn, and winter. 
   Estimated total evaporation from snow, water surfaces, soil, and
   vegetation at Emerald Lake was 22\% of the estimated precipitation. 
   Evaporation from snow was the principal water loss to the atmosphere,
   accounting for about 80\% of the total evaporation.  Actual
   evapotranspiration estimated over 15 nonwinter months was less than 4\%
   of the precipitation during the two water years.  Groundwater storage

Abstract = {{Wet deposition of solutes to an alpine catchment in the southern Sierra
   Nevada was measured from October 1984 through March 1988.  Rainfall had
   a volume-weighted pH of 4.9, and snowfall had a volume-weighted pH of
   5.3.  Acetic and formic acids were important components of all wet
   deposition, contributing 25-30\% of the measured anions in snowfall and,
   through analysis of charge balance deficits, the same percentage in
   rainfall.  The NO3- to SO4(2-) equivalent ratio for all wet deposition
   was 1.16.  Ammonium concentration was tenfold greater than H+ in
   rainfall; ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate appear to be the
   principal nitrate and sulfate containing aerosols in wet deposition. 
   Snowmelt runoff (1985 and 1986) or snowpack runoff plus rainfall during
   the period of snowpack runoff (1987) supplied 90\% of the annual solute
   flux from wet deposition to the catchment.  The amount of snow water
   equivalence (mm m-2) and H+, SO4(2-), and Cl- (eq m-2) in cumulative
   snowfall measured on snowboards was similar to the accumulated
   deposition of these parameters measured in snowpits at midwinter and
   during maximum snow accumulation periods, while about 20\% of the NO3-
   in snowfall was not stored in the winter snowpack.  Dry deposition was
   therefore not an important contributor of H+, NO3-, and SO4(2-) to the
   winter snowpack.  The source of the ions in snowfall was air masses that
   originated over the Pacific Ocean, while low Cl- and Na+ relative to
   NO3- and NH4+ in rainfall indicate that local urban and agricultural
   areas were the major source of the ions in rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{Snowpack runoff contributions to the hydrochemistry of an alpine
   catchment in the Sierra Nevada were evaluated in 1986 and 1987 by
   analyzing snowpack, meltwater, and stream water samples for major
   inorganic ions, conductance, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and
   silicate.  An ionic pulse in meltwater with initial concentrations
   twofold to twelvefold greater than the snowpack average, varying with
   site and with ion, was measured in lysimeters placed at the base of the
   snowpack.  Maximum concentrations of ions in meltwater were inversely
   related to the rate of snowmelt; melt-freeze cycles increased the
   concentration of solutes in meltwater.  Hydrogen concentration in
   meltwater was buffered by ANC produced in part by the dissolution of
   particulates.  The anionic pulse in meltwater was observed in stream
   waters during the first 30 days of snowpack runoff, with NO3-
   concentrations in stream waters at this time about 1.6-fold greater than
   the average NO3- concentration for the time period of snowpack runoff,
   Cl- about 1.5-fold greater and SO4(2-) about 1.3-fold greater.  Maximum
   H+ concentration during snowpack runoff (increase of 170\% over winter
   concentrations) occurred near maximum discharge.  ANC minima occurred at
   maximum discharge as a result of dilution, with a decrease from winter
   concentrations of 70\% in 1986 and 60\% in 1987.  Interactions between
   snowpack runoff and soils were important to the chemistry of stream
   water.  Eighty to ninety percent of the H+ stored in the snowpack was
   consumed before it reached the base of the catchment.  Soils were a sink
   for NH4+ from snowpack meltwater, with less than 1\% of the NH4+
   released from snowpack storage exported from the basin as NH4+.  Sulfate
   concentrations in stream waters were less variable than NO3- or Cl-
   concentrations; sorption processes in soils were a likely cause for the
   regulation of SO4(2-) concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic analyses of groundwater flow and transport are frequently
   based on partial differential equations which have random coefficients
   or forcing terms.  Analytical methods for solving these equations rely
   on restrictive assumptions which may not hold in some practical
   applications.  Numerically oriented alternatives are computationally
   demanding and generally not able to deal with large three-dimensional
   problems.  In this paper we describe a hybrid solution approach which
   combines classical Fourier transform concepts with numerical solution
   techniques.  Our approach is based on a nonstationary generalization of
   the spectral representation theorem commonly used in time series
   analysis.  The generalized spectral representation is expressed in terms
   of an unknown transfer function which depends on space, time, and wave
   number.  The transfer function is found by solving a linearized
   deterministic partial differential equation which has the same form as
   the original stochastic flow or transport equation.  This approach can
   accomodate boundary conditions, spatially variable mean gradients,
   measurement conditioning, and other sources of nonstationarity which
   cannot be included in classical spectral methods.  Here we introduce the
   nonstationary spectral method and show how it can be used to derive
   unconditional statistics of interest in groundwater flow and transport
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Data from an instream tracer experiment performed in North Fork Dry Run,
   Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, illustrate that the transport of
   water and conservative solute in the stream is greatly influenced by
   interaction with water present in both the relatively shallow gravel bed
   and in the relatively deeper alluvial infill material.  The shape of
   concentration-time curves from the field tracer experiment exhibit
   ``storage{''} of tracer in the subsurface-short-term storage imposed by
   exchange with the gravel bed and long-term storage by exchange with the
   deeper alluvial infill.  Time series models fit the observed
   concentration data very well.  Estimates of mixing volumes generated by
   the time series analysis indicate that a large volume of the gravel bed
   participates in rapid mixing with the surface stream.  At one point
   along the study reach a second-order time series model is supported by
   the data, suggesting two independent, parallel flow paths.  Observations
   of tracer in wells more than 10 m from the stream and the very extended
   recession of the tracer in the stream where it flows over a bedrock
   ledge support the contention that the deeper alluvium plays an important
   role in transient storage of solute in North Fork Dry Run.  The work
   implies that physically-based models to predict transport and storage in
   alluviated mountain catchments may have to account for interactions
   between the stream and large portions of its floodplain.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to use pattern recognition in the analysis
   of soil water dynamics in time and space simultaneously.  Space-time
   correlation structures are generated by use of a numerical model for the
   one-dimensional unsaturated flow equation.  By applying the method to
   various soil parameter combinations (unsaturated hydraulic conductivity
   and dispersion coefficient) and length of infiltration periods it is
   shown how space-time dependence of soil water changes.  The method
   clearly visualizes effects of changes in infiltrated input and soil
   heterogeneities which are not noticeable in the original soil water time
   series.  Application of the method to field data reveals small-scale
   heterogeneities and vertical and horizontal variability in hydraulic
   properties.  The method possesses special advantages when analyzing
   time- and space-dependent properties simultaneously.  Since the method
   gives a statistical measure of the dependent property that varies within
   the space-time field, it can be used to interpolate the fields to points
   where observations are not available, to estimate spatial or temporal
   averages from discrete observations, and to define regions (spatial or
   temporal) where observations are the most efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Three approaches to trend analysis of water quality time series are

   observations, with observations assumed to be m dependent; (2) transfer
   function noise model, in which covariate series may be included by means
   of transfer functions, with the remaining noise modeled as a seasonal
   autoregressive moving average process; and (3) component model, with the
   noise decomposed into series which describe trends, and irregular and
   seasonal variation. Models are studied with regards to their ability to
   include covariate series, possibility of interpretation of trends,
   treatment of seasonal variation and serial dependence, and robustness
   for outliers. We regard the component model being the most realistic and
   the most informative of the three approaches. Models are applied to

Abstract = {{Two models for estimating the risk of a flood exceeding some critical
   threshold within a few days (Smith and Karr, 1986; Ettrick et al.,
   1987), which take account of the season and prevailing catchment
   conditions, have recently been published.  The models are fitted to a
   1000-year synthetic data set, to compare the results with empirically
   determined risk estimates.  After some modifications to the Smith and
   Karr method both models demonstrated reasonable accuracy.  A second
   comparison is then made using data from a United Kingdom catchment.  The
   Smith and Karr model was further modified to allow risk estimates for up
   to 30 days ahead to be made.  Both models were applied to both data sets
   for 30 day ahead estimates, and the results demonstrate the sensitivity
   of the risk to prevailing conditions at the beginning of the period. 
   The assumptions, data requirements, and accuracy of the models are
   compared and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Previous attempts to validate general circulation model simulations of
   land surface hydrology have often been limited by the absence of
   systematic historical data, especially for runoff, precipitation, and
   temperature.  Because hydrological response times for unregulated
   watersheds in the United States vary from a few hours to a few days at
   most, climatological studies dealing with land surface hydrology require
   data at relatively short time intervals.  We describe a set of 1009 U.S.
   Geological Survey streamflow stations, and 1036 National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration climatological stations, for which long-term
   (1948-1988) observations have been assembled into a consistent daily
   data base with missing observations estimated using a simple
   closest-station prorating rule.  Care was taken in selection of the
   streamflow stations to assure that the records were essentially free
   from regulation.  The climatological stations are a subset of the
   historical climatology network for which monthly data are described by
   Quinlan et al. (1987).  The data format is provided to facilitate
   development of alternative data retrieval algorithms.  Estimated values
   for missing data, as well as suspicious observations, are flagged.  The
   data are retrievable by station list, state, latitude-longitude range,
   and hydrologic unit code from compact digital read-only memory (CD ROM).
    CD-ROM copies are available from the second author.}},

Abstract = {{A steady state solution is developed for three-dimensional infiltration
   where both the water flux at the soil surface and the soil surface
   topography are nonuniform.  By identifying a small parameter, which is
   defined as a ratio between the vertical and the horizontal
   characteristic lengths, the solution of the linearized equation can then
   be found by using perturbation methods.  The spatial variation of both
   the soil surface topography and the water flux entering the profile
   appears only in parametric form in the equations and boundary conditions
   to all orders of approximation, thus allowing easy evaluation of the
   solution.  The water accumulation due to soil surface topography is
   related to the inner produce between the gradients of the surface
   elevation and the rate of infiltration at the soil surface.  Therefore
   the nonuniformity of the soil surface should be accompanied by a spatial
   nonuniformity of the applied flux in order to produce lateral variations
   in the solution.  This method can be used to evaluate the water
   accumulation in the soil due to general rainfall or irrigation
   distributions.  It can also be used for design purposes in cases where
   one or both sources of nonuniformities in the horizontal directions can
   be controlled, as for example, in an irrigation system in a field with a
   given topography.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model of the long-term evolution of cathchments,
   the growth of their drainage networks,and the changes in elevations
   within both the channels and the hillslopes. Elevation changes are
   determined from continuity equations for flow and sediment transport,
   with sediment transport being related to discharge and slope. The
   central feature of the model is that it explicitly differentiates
   between the sediment transport behavior of the channels and the
   hillslopes on the basis of observed physics, and the channel network
   extension results solely from physically based flow interactions on the
   hillslopes. The difference in behavior of channels and hillslopes is one
   of the most important properties of a catchment. The flow and sediment
   transport continuity equations in the channel and the hillslope are
   coupled and account for the long-term interactions of the elevations in
   the hillslope and in the channels. Sediment transport can be due to
   fluvial processes, creep, and rockslides. Tectonic uplift may increase
   overall catchment elevations. The dynamics of channel head advance, and
   thus network growth, are modeled using a physically based mechanism for
   channel initiation and growth where a channel head advances when a
   channel initiation function, nonlinearly dependent on discharge and
   slope, exceeds a threshold. This threshold controls the drainage density
   of the basin. A computer implementation of the model is introduced, some
   simple simulations presented, and the numerics of the solution technique
   described.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the scaling and similitude properties of the system
   of governing equations for a catchment evolution model that was
   presented in an accompanying paper (Willgoose et al., this issue).
   Similitude is an important concept that allows the quantification of the
   similarities of, and differences between, two catchments. Through the
   use of a small number of nondimensional numbers the governing physics of
   the channel network and surrounding hillslopes in a catchment may be
   summarized. These nondimensional numbers lead to similarity conditions
   that allow for the quantitative comparison of data between field
   catchments the field scale and the controlled experimental scale.
   Derived relationships are presented for the drainage density of the
   channel network and the rate at which the network grows, parameterized
   using the nondimensional numbers. Drainage density is shown to be mostly
   a function of the hillslope channel initiation number that relates the
   slopes and lengths of hillslopes in a very simple fashion. Finally, it
   is shown that the form of a channel network is very sensitive to initial
   conditions. Though the exact form of the network and the hillslopes may
   vary greatly, along with their topological statistics, physical
   statistics such as drainage density are only slightly affected.}},

Abstract = {{An observed log-log linear relationship between channel slope and
   contributing area is explained by the erosional physics that lead to
   catchment form. It is postulated that tectonic uplift is in balance with
   the fluvial erosion downwasting that dominates catchment erosion, and it
   is shown that this relationship results in the observed log-log linear
   relationships at dynamic equilibrium. In addition, it has been observed
   that there are deviations from this log-log linear relationship near the
   catchment divide, with observed slopes being lower than those predicted
   from the relationship. This is explained by noting that for small areas,
   fluvial erosion effects are dominated by soil creep and rain splash,
   modeled by diffusive physics. The area at which this deviation from
   log-log linearity occurs is that point on the hillslope at which
   diffusive physics, like soil creep and rain splash, begin to dominate
   fluvial erosion. These predictions are confirmed by numerical
   simulations using a catchment evolution model.}},

Abstract = {{An implicit coupled double-porosity model has been presented for
   simulating the behavior of deformable fissured porous media.  The finite
   element technique was used to develop the numerical approximation of the
   governing equations.  Using the proposed model, the effect of matrix
   deformation on the behavior of fissured porous media was studied.  It
   was found that (1) the response of a deformable fissured porous medium
   is identical to that of rigid formations with regard to three distinct
   periods of early, intermediate, and late time responses; (2) while
   matrix deformation can significantly contribute to the late time
   productivity of fissured porous media, it has very limited effect on the
   early time productivity; (3) during the early time response period,
   fluid pressure tends to rise in porous blocks before starting to fall;
   this is believed to be consistent with the coupling behavior of
   deformable fissured porous media; and (4) the fissure response of a
   deformable fissured porous medium may be practically simulated using the
   model proposed by Barenblatt et al. (1960) and Warren and Root (1963).}},

Abstract = {{The recent developments and successful applications of
   covariance-related stochastic methods to groundwater field experiments
   suggest that further efforts in developing spatial characterization
   methods are warranted.  One area that deserves further attention is that
   of characterizing multimodal distributions, such as fractured rock
   masses, dolomite rocks with dissolution channels, and sand-shale
   formations.  Traditionally used covariance functions may not be enough
   to fully characterize spatial continuity in applications where the
   pattern of spatial continuity depends on the specific magnitude level of
   the attribute, for example, hydraulic conductivity.  Alternative models
   based on multiple indicator covariances or mixture of populations offer
   greater flexibility.  Applying such models to the case of perfect
   stratification, a stochastic simulation is proposed which allows
   generating different realizations, all sharing the same vertical
   conductivity covariance yet differing by other spatial statistics and
   leading to widely different transport characteristics.  A mere
   covariance-based approach would have failed to distinguish between these
   alternatives.  Investigation of tracer transport in bimodal stratified
   formations suggests a dependence of the mean advection velocity on the
   dispersion coefficients as a result of a mechanism that enhances
   longitudinal dispersion directly proportional to lateral pore scale
   dispersion and entails a diversion of a substantial portion of the plume
   into the low-conductivity layers.  This mechanism may not be evident
   when the class-specific spatial structures of the conductivities are
   ignored.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a method for obtaining risk-qualified estimates of
   various statistics that characterize the migration of a nonreactive
   tracer in heterogeneous porous media.  The steps required to get these
   estimates are as follows:  (1) the solute body is assumed to be composed
   of a large number of imaginary solute particles; (2) a Lagrangian
   description of the migration of the solute particles in space is
   adopted; (3) the Lagrangian description is transformed into an Eulerian
   one by a quasi-linear method, whereby the translation of the particles
   in space is simulated through successive, spatially correlated
   displacements; (4) the plume's various statistics are obtained by
   averaging over the ensemble of simulated particles, and, lastly, (5)
   simultaneous simulation of the motion of two particles in space entails
   the spatial moments of the plume and their variances, and in addition,
   the concentration is obtained qualified by its variance.  The model is
   compared with numerical simulations and is found to compare quite
   favorably even for log conductivity variances as large as 2.6.  This
   study shows that (1) after a certain travel time, the concentration
   variance becomes largest next to the plume center and gets smaller with
   distance from the plume center; (2) the concentration coefficient of
   variation grows with distance from the plume center and prediction of
   the low concentration on the periphery of the plume is subject to the
   largest uncertainty; (3) the concentration coefficient of variation
   grows with time while the concentration variance gets smaller with time;
   and (4) interpretation of field data depends on the interpolation method
   and in particular on the size of the averaging domain.}},

   range of meteorological conditions is presented. An
   evapotranspiration-interception approach is used because it is necessary
   to cope with the changing water availability on the surface, during and
   following rainfall or irrigation. The model is applicable to areas
   ranging from the size of city blocks to land use zones and time periods
   of one hour and longer. The modeled evaporation is compared with that
   from micrometerological measurements conducted from January to June 1987
   in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The results show
   that this approach to modeling urban evapotranspiration provides
   realistic hourly and daily estimates of the areally averaged latent heat
   flux and surface water state.}},

Abstract = {{The complete evaluation of the offsite effects of national policies or
   programs that affect levels of agricultural nonpoint source pollution
   requires linking extensive water quality changes to changes in
   recreational activity.  A sequential decision model is specified to
   describe an individual's decisions about fishing.  A participation model
   for recreational fishing that includes a water quality index reflecting
   regional water quality is developed and estimated as a logit model with
   national level data.  A visitation model for those who decide to fish
   that also includes the water quality index is estimated using ordinary
   least squares.  The water quality index is found to be significant in
   the participation model but not in the visitation model.  Together, the
   two models provide a means of estimating how changes in water quality
   might influence the number of recreation days devoted to fishing.  The
   model is used to estimate changes in fishing participation for the
   Conservation Reserve Program.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops critical values and formulas for computing several
   goodness-of-fit tests for the generalized extreme value (GEV)
   distribution. These tests can check if data available for a site are
   consistent with a regional GEV distribution, except for scale, or if the
   data are consistent with a GEV distribution with a regional value of the
   shape parameter kappa. Three tests employ unbiased probability-weighted
   moment (PWM) estimators of the L moment coefficient of variation (L-CV),
   and coefficient of skewness (L-CS) using formulas for their variances in
   small samples. In a Monte Carlo power study the L-CV test was often more
   powerful than the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test at detecting L-CV
   inconsistencies. A test based upon L-CS generally has equal or greater
   power than the probability plot correlation test at detecting L-CS
   differences; both are poor at detecting thin-tailed alternatives.
   Finally, a new chi-square test based upon sample estimates of both the
   L-CV and L-CS, and their anticipated cross correlation, was much better
   than other tests at detecting departures from the assumed L-CV, L-CS, or
   both, particularly when the regional distribution was highly skewed.}},

Abstract = {{There are three characteristic speeds in open channel hydraulics:  (1)
   the mean flow velocity u, (2) the relative celerity of kinematic waves
   v, and (3) the relative celerity of dynamic waves w.  These three speeds
   give rise to two independent dimensionless ratios:  (1) the
   dimensionless relative celerity of kinematic waves c(k) = v/u, and (2)
   the dimensionless relative celerity of dynamic waves c(d) = w/u.  The
   reciprocal of c(d) is the Froude number F(r) = u/w.  The Vedernikov
   number is the third ratio V = v/w.  Recent developments in the linear
   theory of surface runoff show that the Vedernikov number has a
   significant role in extending the concept of hydraulic diffusivity to
   the realm of dynamic waves.  This new perspective makes possible the
   modeling of catchment dynamics using diffusion waves and including
   inertial effects, under a wide range of boundary friction and
   cross-sectional shape specifications.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fundamental shifts in water allocation and management are occurring
   throughout the West.  Changing public values have reversed our historic
   preference for supply augmentation through the construction of new
   storage systems and replaced it with one for the reallocation of
   existing supplies.  The emerging reallocation era will be characterized
   by the better management of existing supplies to serve both traditional
   and new user communities.  Reallocation can be accomplished in three
   ways:  (1) the rededication of unallocated or unused blocks of stored
   water on federal and state reservoirs, (2) the voluntary transfer of
   existing water rights, and (3) the redefinition of existing rights by
   judicial decisions and legislation which trim consumptive entitlements. 
   We currently lack a coherent water allocation principle to replace the
   equation of conservation with storage and maximum consumption, but we
   are simultaneously trying to reduce the transaction costs of transfers
   and to impose a number of ad hoc state and federal restraints on water
   transfers to accommodate the previously neglected claims of
   nontraditional water users and other interested parties.  These new laws
   can greatly increase the costs of transfers and make them politically
   unattractive.  The expanded recognition of traditional and new third
   party rights could produce a new riparianism in the West.  This would
   overturn the law of prior appropriation which has thrived because it was
   premised on the serverance of the right to use water from its source and
   allowed water to be allocated to new demands.  In contrast, the common
   law of riparian rights confines water rights to landowners in the
   watershed of a stream.  From the beginning, western courts rejected the
   watershed limitation, but many recent transfer restraints modify the law
   of prior appropriation and reintroduce the principle of watershed
   protection rule in the form of a premise that river systems should be
   managed on an ecosystem basis.  Emerging new watershed rules could make
   all transfers presumptively suspect.}},

Abstract = {{Automated extraction of geometry for hydraulic routing from digital
   elevation models (DEM) is a procedure that must be easily accomplished
   for widespread application of distributed hydraulically based rainfall
   excess-runoff models. One-dimensional kinematic routing on a regular
   grid DEM is difficult due to flow division and convergence.
   Two-dimensional kinematic routing on a triangular irregular network
   (TIN) surmounts many of these difficulties. Because TIN DEMs typically
   require far fewer points to represent topography than regular grid DEMs,
   substantial computational economy is also realized. One-dimensional
   routing using vector contour data overcomes the grid-based routing
   disadvantages but often requires several orders of magnitude more
   storage points than a TIN. The methodology presented in this paper
   represents a compromise between slightly increased computational
   complexity and the economy of TIN topographic representation. We take
   the unique approach of subdividing each topographic triangle (TIN facet)
   into a set of coplanar triangular finite elements, performing routing on
   a single facet and then routing the resulting excess hydrograph to
   downstream facets and channels via upstream boundary conditions. Results
   indicate that shock conditions are readily handled, computed depths
   match analytic results to within +/- 3\% and volume balances are
   typically within 1\%. This modeling system illustrates the viability of
   kinematic routing over a TIN DEM derived directly from digital mapping
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Chaos analysis has altered the way we view natural systems.  Complex or
   random-appearing phenomena may be chaotic and thus deterministic, rather
   than random.  In this study, we used the Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm
   (GPA) to evaluate a runoff time series from a second-order catchment in
   southwestern Idaho for chaotic dynamics.  GPA can identify the presence
   of low-dimensional chaotic dynamics for experimental time series.  A
   daily runoff record, 8800 days in length, was examined.  We found no
   evidence of chaotic dynamics in snowmelt runoff.  Snowmelt runoff
   measured at a daily time step has a large number of degrees of freedom,
   which is characteristic of a random rather than chaotic process.  These
   results suggest that the random-appearing behavior of snowmelt runoff is
   generated from the complex interactions of many factors, rather than
   low-dimensional chaotic dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents some new results for the transfer and extension of
   information at sites with short hydrological records.  The results refer
   particularly to the transfer and extension of annual flood data.  The
   methods described make use of incomplete or ``censored{''} data such as
   may be supplied by people living near a river or from records collected
   for nonhydrological purposes, and they constitute extensions to methods
   already described in the literature.  For two specific censoring
   configurations, the gain in information is assessed analytically; it is
   shown that, under certain conditions, the gain in information can be
   substantial, but in general the gain is small, particularly where scale
   parameters are estimated.  For other configurations of censored data, an
   analytical formulation is not possible, and integrals are given from
   which information gain may be assessed by numerical calculation. 
   Another result extends the use of flood peaks exceeding some threshold
   value ({''}peaks over a threshold,{''} POTs); probabilistic models of
   flood frequency using POTs are, in effect, fitted using censored data. 
   The value of the results presented in the paper is likely to be
   restricted by assumptions about the probabilistic structure of flood
   sequence:  in one case that their distribution (at different sites) is
   bivariate lognormal, and, for the POT model, that floods occur as a
   Poisson process with POTs exponentially distributed.  The results show,
   in strictly qualitative terms, the circumstances in which information
   might be gained by the use of censored data at two sites, and how large
   (or small) the gains might be.}},

   hillcrests.  The major geometrical influence on the flow processes is
   the slope angle.  Only when sigma-1 (sigma = surface total curvature) is
   less than about 10 times the characteristic infiltration length l(grav)

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional finite difference model to study the simultaneous
   movement of a dense, nonaqueous phase liquid and water in heterogeneous
   porous media is developed.  A distinctive feature of the solution is
   that the primary variables solved for, wetting phase pressure and
   wetting phase saturation, are both existent throughout the solution
   domain regardless of whether the nonwetting phase is present.  This
   eliminates the need to specify small, fictitious saturations of
   nonwetting fluid ahead of the advancing front where only wetting fluid
   is present, as is often required in conventional simulators.  The model
   is therefore well suited for the simulation of groundwater contamination
   problems involving the advance of immiscible liquids into previously
   uncontaminated groundwater systems.  The finite difference equations are
   solved fully implicitly using Newton-Raphson iteration.  In order to
   minimize computer storage and execution time a Dupont-Kendall-Rachford
   iterative solver utilizing Orthomin acceleration has been incorporated. 
   The numerical model is verified against an exact analytical solution
   which incorporates fully the effects of both relative permeability and
   capillary pressure.  The model is validated through comparison to a
   parallel-plate laboratory experiment involving the infiltration of
   tetrachloroethylene into a heterogeneous sand pack.}},

Abstract = {{The migration of a dense, nonaqueous phase liquid through heterogeneous
   porous media is examined using numerical simulation.  Laboratory
   measurements of capillary pressure-saturation curves were performed on
   samples obtained from a sand aquifer and scaled to permeability to
   provide a data base of model input parameters.  Numerical simulations
   incorporating 25,200 finite difference cells are carried out in a
   spatially correlated, random permeability field to illustrate the
   influence of fluid properties on the migration of a nonwetting liquid
   below the water table.  The simulation results are characterized by
   spatial moments to reflect the relative degrees of lateral spreading
   exhibited by the migrating nonwetting body in the presence of lenses of
   differing permeability.  In addition, numerical simulations were
   performed in a solution domain containing a single lens of lower
   permeability material in order to examine the local-scale sensitivity to
   porous media and fluid properties.  The results of the study show the
   migration of a nonwetting liquid to be extremely sensitive to subtle
   variations in the capillary properties of the porous medium and to be
   influenced strongly by the fluid physical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Shallow groundwater under Kesterson Reservoir, Merced County,
   California, was contaminated over a period of 6 years while the
   reservior was used for disposal of brackish subsurface agricultural
   drainage water from farmlands in the San Joaquin Valley.  Drainage water
   contained an average of 10,000 mg/L total dissolved solids (TDS), high
   concentrations of selenium (300-mu-g/L), nitrate (37 mg/L as nitrogen),
   boron (15 mg/L), and lesser amounts of mercury, chromium, and
   molybdenum.  Infiltration and lateral migration of this water created a
   20-m-deep plume of high-TDS, boron-rich water covering an area of about
   5 km2.  Transport of selenium and nitrate was inhibited by
   biogeochemical reactions in the pond bottom sediments, so that migration
   of these two constituents into the aquifer was limited.  This paper
   focuses on physical parameters affecting seepage and lateral migration
   of nonreactive solutes and on hydrogeological factors associated with
   selenium break-through into the shallow aquifer.  An accompanying paper
   describes biogeochemical processes that limit nitrate and selenium
   migration (White et al., this issue).  The regional hydrogeologic system
   at Kesterson Reservoir is dominated by the presence of four
   lithostratigraphic units.  These are, in order of increasing depth, a
   fine-grained surfical layer extending to depths of as much as 8 m, a
   semiconfined sandy aquifer extending to 60 m, a widespread lacustrine
   clay confining layer, and a confined sandy aquifer.  Within each of
   these units, order of magnitude variations in the hydrologic properties
   of the sediments occur ubiquitously over lateral distances of tens of
   meters and vertical distances of a fraction of a meter.  Seepage rates
   from the ponds into the underlying aquifer are dominated by local
   hydrogeologic properties and thickness of the fine-grained surface
   layer.  Selenium migrated into the aquifer in an area where the
   fine-grained surface layer was thin or absent.  Once in the aquifer,
   local rates of migration are controlled by the small-scale structure and
   hydrogeologic properties of the sediments.  The aquifer is composed of a
   heterogeneous mixture of sands, silts, and clays.  Individual sand beds,
   which average about 0.3 m thick, do not appear to extend over lateral
   distances of more than 30 m.  The large range of velocities combined
   with a limited lateral extent of individual layers are expected to
   create a broadly dispersed plume of solutes migrating downgradient from
   Kesterson.  A noninvasive electromagnetic survey of electrical
   conductivity distributions in the shallow aquifer appears to confirm
   this conceptual model for transport in the shallow aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of selenium in groundwater at the Kesterson Reservoir in the
   Central Valley of California was strongly retarded because of chemical
   reduction and precipitation mediated by microbial activity.  Under such
   conditions, negative correlations were documented between aqueous Se and
   Fe2+, Mn, and H2S.  Locally, the presence of oxidizing species, notably
   O2 and NO3, suppressed this reduction, permitting Se mobilization in the
   shallow aquifer.  Selenate, the dominant and most oxidized from of Se,
   was in electrochemical disequilibrium with subordinate concentrations of
   selenite.  Normally slow inorganic reduction rates were accelerated by
   microbial activity which utilizes oxidized chemical species including
   selenate as electron donors during the oxidation of organic matter.  Two
   stratified redox barriers to selenium migration were documented beneath
   Kesterson:  an underlying shallow anoxic zone underlying most of the
   pond bottom, characterized by high organic content and sulfate
   reduction, and a deeper dynamic front established by localized O2
   infiltration from the overlying ponds and Fe2+ release from aquifer
   materials.  The reducing nature of this deeper aquifer ultimately
   precludes Se transport to regional groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic cycle of an arctic watershed is dominated by such
   physical elements as snow, ice, permafrost, seasonally frozen soils,
   wide fluctuations in surface energy balance, and phase change of snow
   and ice to water.  Hydrologic data collected over a 5-year period
   (1985-1989) from an arctic watershed in northern Alaska are presented. 
   Processes related to snow accumulation, redistribution, ablation,
   evaporation and subsequent snowmelt-generated runoff are discussed.  The
   total water content of the snowpack at the end of winter has comprised
   between 28 and 40\% of the annual precipitation.  Redistribution of snow
   on the ground by the wind is a major factor in increasing the snowmelt
   runoff.  Much of the redistributed snow accumulates in the valley bottom
   along the stream and also along depressions on the hillslopes.  These
   depressions are small surface drainage channels that are referred to as
   water tracks.  Partitioning of the snowmelt into runoff, evaporation and
   increased soil water storage in the active layer was carried out on the
   plot and watershed scale.  Over a 5-year period, the volume of snowmelt
   runoff varied from 50 to 66\% of the average watershed snowpack, while
   evaporation varied from 20 to 34\% and soil moisture storage increased
   between 10 and 19\%.  Much greater variation in these hydrologic
   components occurred at the plot scale.}},

Abstract = {{Lack of hydrologic data in the Arctic, particularly during snowmelt,
   severely limits modeling strategy.  Spring snowmelt in Imnavait
   watershed is a very brief event, usually lasting about 10 days.  Peak
   flow normally occurs within 36 hours of the beginning of streamflow. 
   All downslope movement of water occurs within the top 10 cm of the
   highly organic soil mat or on the surface.  Snow damming of snowmelt
   runoff is an important mechanism which must be considered in the
   modeling process of small watersheds.  These unique characteristics of
   Arctic hydrology will affect the methodology and performance of a
   hydrologic model.  The HBV model was used in an investigation of the
   hydrologic regime of an Arctic watershed during the spring snowmelt
   period.  From the analysis of five spring melt events we found that HBV
   can adequately predict soil moisture, evaporation, snow ablation and
   accumulation, and runoff.  It models the volumes of snowmelt runoff
   well, but more data are needed to improve the determination of snowmelt
   initiation.  Use of HBV as a predictive tool is dependent upon the
   quality of the meteorologic forecast data.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate modeling in the groundwater environment must incorporate
   microbial denitrification as the major process of nitrate elimination. A
   multispecies transport model is presented which describes the
   interaction of oxygen, nitrate, organic carbon, and bacteria. Three
   phases (mobile pore water, biophase, and aquifer material) are taken
   into account. The model is applied to a natural aquifer situation as
   well as to an in situ remediation case where nitrate is employed as an
   oxidant. In the natural aquifer it is shown that the release of organic
   carbon from the matrix is the controlling factor for denitrification. In
   the remediation case, on the other hand, the data suggest that diffusion
   limitation of the nutrient supply to the biophase controls bacterial
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{The rate-limited sorption and nonequilibrium transport of several
   hydrophobic organic chemicals in three low-organic carbon (< 0.025\%)
   aquifer materials was investigated.  Results of miscible displacement
   experiments performed at two pore water velocities and with very low
   solution-phase concentrations (30-60-mu-g L-1) were analyzed using a
   first-order mass transfer nonequilibrium model, as well as a model
   employing the local equilibrium assumption.  Results of the analyses
   revealed sorption to be significantly rate limited, possibly by a
   diffusion-limited mechanism.  The impact of rate-limited sorption on
   transport was dependent upon pore water velocity.  The experiments
   performed at a faster velocity (approximately 1 cm/h) could be
   successfully simulated only with the nonequilibrium model, whereas the
   equilibrium model was adequate for the slower-velocity (approximately
   0.2 cm/h) experiments.  Comparison of experimental results to those
   reported in the literature revealed that time scale has a significant
   impact on the degree of nonequilibrium observed in, and on the values of
   rate constants determined from, experiments.  Regression equations were
   developed for the two kinetics-associated parameters contained in the
   nonequilibrium model:  first-order mass transfer constant and fraction
   of instantaneous sorption.}},

Abstract = {{Several noniterative procedures for solving the nonlinear Richards
   equation are introduced and compared to the conventional Newton and
   Picard iteration methods.  Noniterative strategies for the numerical
   solution of transient, nonlinear equations arise from explicit or linear
   time discretizations, or they can be obtained by linearizing an implicit
   differencing scheme.  We present two first order accurate linearization
   methods, a second order accurate two-level ``implicit factored{''}
   scheme, and a second order accurate three-level ``Lees{''} method.  The
   accuracy and computational efficiency of these four schemes and of the
   Newton and Picard methods are evaluated for a series of test problems
   simulating one-dimensional flow processes in unsaturated porous media. 
   The results indicate that first order accurate schemes are inefficient
   compared to second order accurate methods; that second order accurate
   noniterative schemes can be quite competitive with the iterative Newton
   and Picard methods; and that the Newton scheme is no less efficient than
   the Picard method, and for strongly nonlinear problems can outperform
   the Picard scheme.  The two second order accurate noniterative schemes
   appear to be attractive alternatives to the iterative methods, although
   there are concerns regarding the stability behavior of the three-level
   scheme which need to be resolved.  We conclude that of the four
   noniterative strategies presented, the implicit factored scheme is the
   most promising, and we suggest improved formulations of the method.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model is introduced describing the spatial distribution of
   two immiscible fluids in the pore space of sphere packings.  The model
   is based on the ideal soil concept of homogeneous arrangement of
   identical spheres but is generalized to include random packing.  It
   quantitatively analyzes the interfacial area between wetting and
   nonwetting fluids and between the fluids and the solid spheres, as a
   function of the saturation degree.  These relationships depend on the
   packing arrangement of the spheres, the sphere radius, and the
   fluid-solid contact angle.  The model focuses on the region of low
   saturation of the wetting phase, where the wetting phase is comprised of
   pendular rings.  When the nonwetting phase appears as ganglia, the model
   assumes single-chamber ganglia.  Three-dimensional graphical
   illustrations are provided.  Three potential applications are pointed
   out:  (1) to quantify the water-air interface in the unsaturated zone;
   (2) to analyze connate water interfacial area in petroleum reservoirs
   and to assess the effect of surfactants during enhanced oil recovery;
   and (3) to estimate the interface between groundwater and floating
   nonaqueous phase liquids above the water table.}},

Abstract = {{An automated method of partitioning catchments into interconnected
   elements using a ``stream tube{''} approach and vector or contour-based
   digital elevation models is briefly described.  With this form of
   partitioning, hydrologic models can be structured based on the
   hydraulics of flow within a catchment and the effects of topography on
   runoff producing mechanisms and spatially distributed flow
   characteristics (such as flow depth and velocity) can be directly, and
   realistically, accounted for in the models.  The method allows complex
   three-dimensional flow problems to be reduced to a series of coupled
   one-dimensional problems in areas with complex terrain.  Two simple
   process-oriented hydrologic models that demonstrate the utility of this
   form of partitioning are presented.  The first models subsurface
   flow-saturation overland flow and the second models Hortonian overland
   flow.  Observed and predicted runoff hydrographs and the dynamic
   expansion and contraction of runoff source areas on a small laboratory
   microcatchment are presented.  Also shown are predicted runoff
   hydrographs and surface flow velocities on a small rangeland catchment
   in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{The steady distribution of moisture beneath a two-dimensional strip
   source is analyzed by applying the quasi-linear approximation.  The
   source is described by specifying either the moisture content or the
   infiltration rate.  A water table is specified at some depth D below the
   surface, the depth varying from shallow to semi-infinite.  Numerical
   solutions are determined, via the boundary integral equation method, as
   a function of the material inverse sorptive length alpha, the width of
   the strip source 2L, and the depth to the water table.  The moisture
   introduced at the source is broadly spread below the surface when
   alpha-L << 1, for which absorption by capillary forces is dominant over
   gravity-induced flow.  Conversely, the distribution becomes fingerlike
   along the vertical when alpha-L >> 1, where gravity is dominant over
   absorption.  For a source described by specifying the moisture content,
   the presence of a water table at finite depth influences the
   infiltration through the source when alpha-D is less than about 4;
   infiltration rates obtained assuming the water table depth is
   semi-infinite are of sufficient accuracy for greater values of alpha-D. 
   When the source is described by a specified infiltration flux, the
   maximum allowable value of this flux for which the material beneath the
   source remains unsaturated is determined as a function of nondimensional
   sorptive number and depth to the water table.}},

Abstract = {{Two-phase flows in which the pressure profile is essentially constant
   are called quasi-steady.  One-dimensional quasi-steady flows have the
   remarkable property that volumetric flux is essentially independent of
   position and is a function of time alone.  Such volumetric fluxes are
   (to within an additive constant) inversely proportional to the spatial
   mean value of flowing viscosity.  Consequently, the evolution of such a
   system is controlled by global properties of viscosity.  Vertical
   two-phase quasi-steady flows evolving from an initial steady flow to
   another final steady flow are analyzed, and the corresponding theory is
   matched to output from a numerical simulator.  Good agreement between
   the theory and simulator is demonstrated for simple shocks and expansion

Abstract = {{The choice of appropriate intrablock approximations for the unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity is a critical step for the numerical solution of
   Richards equation.  Forms commonly used include arithmetic, geometric
   and harmonic averaging.  The choice is most often based on convenience
   and custom.  This study presents a framework for comparing any scheme
   for weighting the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity against the correct
   Darcian flow across a block for steady conditions.  Such comparisons are
   carried out for a number of commonly used averages, and errors are shown
   to be alarmingly high in some cases.  A scheme for approximately
   matching the correct Darcian flux is illustrated by two infiltration
   examples.  In the first, the arithmetic and weighted schemes are
   superior to the geometric average when compared to a quasi-analytical
   solution.  For the second example, the weighted solution is slightly
   better than either the arithmetic or geometric averaging schemes.  These
   examples also illustrate that an acceptable mass balance should not be
   used as a sole criterion for success as it can probably be attained with

   an extreme-value type I, II, or III, and it thus provides an effective
   theoretical tool for understanding the behavior of conditional expected
   values for a large class of distribution functions used in science and

Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1239-1251}},

Abstract = {{The large-scale tracer test conducted at the Borden site included
   detailed three-dimensional plume monitoring, but most previous studies
   have emphasized the interpretation of the data in a two-dimensional
   sense.  Here, an independent analysis of the fully three-dimensional
   nature of the plume is developed using a linear spatial interpolation
   scheme which differs significantly from the gridded higher-order
   interpolation scheme used in earlier analyses.  A detailed examination
   of the data base reveals significant truncation of the plume during
   several sampling sessions.  This feature explains the low mass estimates
   obtained during the later sampling sessions.  Consequently, there are
   significant uncertainties associated with the corresponding
   second-moment estimates.  This uncertainty, which calls into question
   any refined comparisons of second-moment evolution with stochastic
   theories, has not been recognized in previous interpretations of the
   second-moment estimates.  The estimated vertical macrodispersivity is
   found to be about twice that attributable to molecular diffusion.  The
   estimated horizontal transverse macrodispersivity is much larger than
   the vertical macrodispersivity.  Temporal variations in the flow appear
   to provide a plausible explanation of the large horizontal transverse
   macrodispersivity.  Anamolous behavior of the second-moment evolution
   suggests the role of a large-scale heterogeneity during the later
   portion of the test, indicating possible mutual interactions between the
   second-moment components.}},

   the determination and usefulness of a measure of predictive uncertainty
   in a particular distributed physically based model, using the methods of
   Rosenblueth (1975) and Monte Carlo simulation, in an application to an
   upland catchment in Wales.  An examination of the role of predictive
   uncertainty in assessing the hydrological effect of land use change is

   be high and can be sensitive to the effects of land use change.}},

   analogous to those used in the standard gravity-driven constant- and
   falling-head methods.  Both centrifugal methods were tested on several
   fine-textured samples of soil and ceramic with K(sat) between about
   10(-10) and 10(-9) m/s.  The results were compared to falling-head
   gravity measurements.  The comparison shows most measurements agreeing
   to within 20\% for a given sample, much of the variation probably
   resulting from run-to-run changes in sample structure.  The falling-head
   centrifuge method proved to be especially simple in design and operation
   and was more accurate than the constant-head method.  With modified
   apparatus, K(sat) measurements less than 10(-10) m/s should be
   attainable.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to develop a method for predicting the
   spatial moments and concentration of a tracer plume conditional to
   locally measured data.  We set this study in a probabilistic frame due
   to the inherent inability to characterize deterministically the flow
   domain.  Our starting point is the Dagan (1984) conceptual model which
   relates the concentration to the translation of tagged elements of
   solute mass.  Then, using Darcy's law and the flow equations, we
   describe that translation using a random function model for the
   velocity.  Comparison with numerical simulations shows this model to be
   favorable for variances of the log conductivity as large as 2.56
   (Dykstra-Parsons coefficient of 0.8).  It is shown how this random
   function model is correlated with the hydraulic head and conductivity
   fields, and furthermore, how it can be made conditional to measured
   data.  It is concluded that conditioning improves predictions of the
   spatial moments of the tracer plume by making a more comprehensive use
   of available data and has a potential for a large range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of spatial variability in sorption parameters is investigated
   for field scale solute transport in the unsaturated zone.  The
   considered sorption reaction is kinetically controlled
   sorption-desorption coupled with a parallel linear equilibrium isotherm.
   The source of solute is assumed to be distributed over a heterogeneous
   field where the horizontal extent of the source area is significantly
   larger than the depth to the groundwater table.  The transport model is
   expressed in terms of the mass flux and in dimensionless form, where the
   effect of equilibrium sorption is incorporated in the dimensionless
   parameters of the kinetic sorption model.  The influence of different
   correlation properties between the sorption parameters and the hydraulic
   conductivity at saturation, K(s), on the expected field scale mass flux
   of solute is illustrated.  The results indicate that spatially variable
   sorption rate coefficients with negative or no correlation to K(s) may
   result in an earlier mass arrival and a considerably altered form of the
   breakthrough curve compared to the case of constant sorption parameters.
   In addition, a comparison between the flux-averaged and the resident
   concentration models indicates that spatial variability in the sorption
   rate coefficients has similar effects on the temporal variation of the
   field-scale resident concentration as on the field scale mass flux of
   solute.}},

Abstract = {{The basis of existing methods for the quantitative description of the
   plan geometry of rivers is determination of the characteristics of
   individual meander bends (macroforms).  This approach is effective when
   one is working with a few well-defined macroforms.  However, the plan
   pattern of many rivers is really determined at the next higher geometric
   level, the morphologically homogeneous river section, which may comprise
   many tens of macroforms, often with several superimposed scales.  At
   this level, macroform parameters alone do not seem adequate to describe
   the geometry of the section.  New indices are required.  The concept of
   fractals affords a natural way of defining such indices.  The presence
   of hierarchical features (superimposed sinuosity on various scales,
   braiding with superimposed bars of a range of sizes, etc.) suggests
   fractal behavior, at least over certain ranges of spatial scale.  In
   this paper we demonstrate fractal behavior for 46 river sections in
   Moldavia from measurements made from existing topographic maps.  We also
   introduce the notion of internal and external fractal scales that limit
   the range of fractal behavior; here the internal and external scales are
   the width of the river channel B and of its valley floor B0,
   respectively.  Using this idea together with elements of fractal
   geometry, we obtain a relation among the sinuosity, B, B0, and the
   fractal dimension D of the river bed pattern.  We propose the use of D
   as a new and informative parameter for describing the internal structure
   of the plan pattern of both single-thread and multithread rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Total recharge was 81\% larger for a sandy basin with an organic mat
   filter than for the same basin with a clean, fully renovated surface,
   but without the mat.  Surface impedance was larger for check areas
   without organic mat, while areas with the mat exhibited impedance
   increases to greater depths.  Experimental results indicated a likely
   trade-off between short-term recharge enhancement and an eventual larger
   depth of renovation to offset deeper sediment penetration under the mat.
   A substantial decrease in hydraulic impedance and a corresponding
   increase in infiltration rate were measured between 90 and 400 hours and
   indicated that despite large sediment influx, soil hydraulic
   conductivity was larger under the organic mat than for the same basin
   positions on clean sands using clean water.  The large decrease in
   impedance is attributed to microbial transformation of O2 to CO2 which
   increased water-filled large porosity.}},

Abstract = {{Results from the Borden tracer test are used to evaluate the performance
   of the stochastic model developed by Graham and McLaughlin (1989a, b). 
   The model assumes that spatial variations in hydraulic conductivity
   induce variations in a steady state velocity field which, in turn,
   induce variations in solute concentration.  Analytical expressions for
   the unconditional ensemble moments of velocity are derived from the
   unconditional ensemble moments of log hydraulic conductivity.  The
   velocity moments are related to the ensemble moments of concentration by
   a set of coupled partial differential equations.  The dependent
   variables in these equations are the concentration mean and covariance
   and the velocity-concentration covariance (or macrodispersive flux). 
   Macrodispersion is not assumed to be Fickian.  The moment equations are
   solved with a dual-grid finite element algorithm.  The nonstationary
   concentration covariances obtained from the finite element solution
   provide the information needed to condition estimates of velocity and
   concentration on a small set of concentration measurements.  In the
   Borden application considered here conditioning is performed
   sequentially, at 85 days and at 260 days after the injection of a pulse
   of conservative tracer (chloride).  The conditional mean concentration
   provides a better estimate of the true chloride concentration than the
   unconditional mean.  The concentration variance and macrodispersive flux
   both decrease at conditioning times but gradually increase after the
   solute plume moves out of the sampling grid.  The performance of the
   stochastic model, as indicated by an analysis of measurement residuals,
   is generally consistent with the model's own estimates of concentration
   uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{At the field scale, because of the relatively large number of
   observation points required to estimate the spatial distributions of
   hydraulic properties, application of inversion procedures must be based
   on a characteristic of the flow that for a given point in the field can
   be measured with relative ease, and can be used as input for the
   inversion procedure.  Suggesting the use of infiltration data for this
   purpose, and recognizing the fact that a basic requirement for the
   design of a transient flow experiment is that the resulting inverse
   problem be sufficiently well posed to allow solution, this paper
   addresses the question under which circumstances the resulting inverse
   problem is well posed, utilizing the concepts of identifiability,
   uniqueness, and stability.  For this purpose, three different models of
   the soil hydraulic properties were analyzed.  The main conclusion of
   this study is that when infiltration data measured at the Darcy scale
   are used as input for the inversion procedure, the inclusion of prior
   information on a single measurable parameter, the saturated conductivity
   K(s), in the estimation criterion will enhance the likelihood of
   uniqueness and stability of the inverse solution provided that the
   structure of the hydraulic model is sufficiently simple.  However, since
   for a particular situation, it is impossible to determine a priori
   whether the resultant inverse problem is well posed or not, this must be
   carried out only a posteriori by solving the problem several times with
   different initial parameter estimates, accompanied by an analysis of the
   associated estimation errors.}},

Abstract = {{Socioeconomic and climatological data of the major cities of the western
   region of Saudi Arabia have been used to develop several models to
   estimate the residential water usage for different kinds of houses.  The
   developed models correlate the residential water usages with
   temperature, income, family size, price of water, and availability of a
   garden within the house.  The study shows that the residential water
   uses in houses supplied by a public pipe network are 1 4-2 times greater
   than the residential water uses in houses supplied by tankers.  It also
   shows that the price elasticities are very similar to those estimated in
   the United States.  Income elasticities, on the other hand, are lower
   than those typically found in more industrialized countries.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Reservoir system simulation models are widely used to determine a
   system's firm water yield, average yield, or hydropower capacity.  Most
   such models use heuristic guidelines to define the system's operating
   policy.  Alternatively, optimization can be used within the simulation
   to identify a reasonable operating strategy.  In this paper a
   theoretical justification is provided for several heuristic operating
   guidelines, including the widely used space rule.  The guidelines are
   expressed as a mathematical objective function and combined with
   constraints on system operation to yield one-period optimization
   submodels that can be used to determine releases within a simulation. 
   Use of these one-period optimization models improved the simulated
   operation of the Central Valley Project in California over the critical
   period of provided reasonable policies for other hydrologic scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{An analog method is used to simulate a discrete transmissivity field
   free of the artifacts inherent in conventional multivariate Gaussian
   statistical generation methods.  The simulated field provides a
   realistic model of a formation exhibiting the spatial continuity of
   extreme transmissivities which gives rise to barriers and preferential
   channels for flow.  The heterogeneous transmissivity field and the
   corresponding steady-state head and discharge fields are characterized
   in a geostatistical framework and observed spatial statistics are
   compared with theoretical results from the stochastic hydrogeology
   literature.  The simulated transmissivity field exhibits a bimodal
   distribution and strong directional anisotropy with nested scales of
   heterogeneity.  Despite these significant departures from standard
   models, the observed head covariance and head-log transmissivity
   cross-covariance agree well with theory.  The spatial covariance of
   specific discharge is highly anisotropic reflecting preferential
   channeling in the mean direction of flow and the conservation of flux
   along streamlines.  The effective transmissivity of the field is
   predicted more accurately by the spatial geometric average than by
   theoretical models despite the flow channeling and the anisotropy of
   heterogeneity.  Tracer spreading, modeled by particle tracking, is
   non-Fickian at displacements of up to 13.4 times the log-transmissivity
   integral range because transport behavior is dominated by convection
   along a small number of preferential channels.  The observed scale
   dependence of apparent longitudinal dispersivity is predicted generally
   well by theory.  Results of this study suggest that ensemble theoretical
   models based on perturbation approaches can provide reasonable estimates
   of general flow and transport properties of single field realizations
   under moderate conditions of heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical procedure for the determination of equivalent grid block
   permeability tensors for heterogeneous porous media is presented.  The
   method entails solution of the fine scale pressure equation subject to
   periodic boundary conditions to yield, upon appropriate averaging of the
   fine scale velocity field, the coarse scale or equivalent grid block
   permeability.  When the region over which this coarse scale permeability
   is computed constitutes a representative elementary volume (REV), the
   resulting equivalent permeability may be interpreted as the effective
   permeability of the region.  Solution of the pressure equation on the
   fine scale is accomplished through the application of an accurate
   triangle-based finite element numerical procedure, which allows for the
   modeling of geometrically complex features.  The specification of
   periodic boundary conditions is shown to yield symmetric, positive
   definite equivalent permeability tensors in all cases.  The method is
   verified through application to a periodic model problem and is then
   applied to the scale up of areal and cross sections with fractally
   generated permeability fields.  The applicability and limitations of the
   method for these more general heterogeneity fields are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Current algorithms that deduce the drainage network from a digital
   elevation model (DEM) represented by a regular array of surface
   elevations share a fault:  Unless the terrain is rugged, the derived
   water channels tend to flow in parallel lines along preferred directions
   engendered by the sampling grid orientation.  We present a simple
   solution to the problem.  A second difficulty is the presence of noise
   that creates artificial pits.  We briefly describe a method which deals
   with pits in what we believe to be a more efficient manner for virtual
   memory environments than previous efforts.  Our system has treated DEMs
   of nearly 9,000,000 pixels.  We show how depth first search of the
   resulting drainage network permits segmentation of the DEM into basins
   by various criteria, analysis of stream-sediment anomaly dilution
   profiles, improved hydrological models and other applications.}},

Abstract = {{In crop simulation models the water subroutine computes evaporation and
   transpiration separately.  This property allows a greater confidence in
   the simulation of the early crop stages in terms of water requirements. 
   In the present article the authors suggest a semiempirical model of the
   drying stage of soil evaporation that can be easily integrated into
   various crop models.  The model is based on a physical approach, yet it
   depends solely on permanent soil properties and on some key data on the
   local climate.  The basic theory relies upon the mass balance of a dry
   surface layer of varying thickness.  After successive assumptions on the
   main limiting factors of the drying process, the authors demonstrate
   that this process can be described by one equation relating actual to
   potential evaporation.  The advantage of this formula comes from its
   introducing just one synthetic parameter that can be expressed as the
   product of two components:  a climatic one and a pedological one.  When
   compared with experimental data, the results of the model show that the
   order of magnitude of the evaporative process is respected, which is
   required for crop models.}},

Abstract = {{The solution via dynamic programming (DP) of a reservior optimal control
   problem is often computationally prohibitive when the proper description
   of the inflow process leads to a system model having several state
   variables and/or when a sufficiently dense state discretization is
   required to achieve numerical accuracy.  Thus, to simplify, the inflow
   correlation is usually neglected and/or a coarse state discretization is
   adopted.  However, these simplifications may significantly affect the
   reliability of the solution of the optimization problem.  Nowadays, the
   availability of very powerful computers based on innovative
   architectures (vector and parallel machines), even in the domain of
   personal computers (transputer architectures), stimulates the
   reformulation of the standard dynamic programming algorithm in a form
   able to exploit these new machine architectures.  The reformulated DP
   algorithm and new machines enable faster and less costly solution of
   optimization problems involving a system model having two state
   variables (storage and previous period inflow, then taking into account
   the inflow correlation) and a number of states (of the order of 10(4))
   such as to guarantee a high numerical accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Regional daily evaporation was estimated by means of continuous
   measurements of the available energy flux at the surface and one or more
   instantaneous determinations of the evaporative fraction (EF). The data
   were obtained during the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) in
   northeastern Kansas. EF, which is the ratio of the latent heat flux and
   the available energy flux, was assumed to be constant during the
   daylight hours; thus it was determined from only a few instantaneous
   surface flux values calculated on the basis of radiosonde profiles in
   the surface layer, together with remotely sensed surface temperature.
   Comparison of 23 estimated and measured daytime evaporation values
   showed good correlation (r = 0.97), although the evaporation was
   underestimated by about 5\% on average. In the estimation of daily
   evaporation, nighttime evaporation must also be considered; measurements
   by means of the eddy correlation method showed that on average it
   accounted for some 8\% of the total daily evaporation.}},

   Simulated soil temperature averaged 851 SDD for the 20 sites. 
   Sensitivity analyses indicated that this average could vary by 0-88 SDD
   (0-10\% of the mean) because of possible parameter error.  Removing the
   forest canopy and the moss cover caused the soil to warm, on average, by
   408 and 345 SDD, respectively.  Elevation and soil drainage differences
   among sites were of secondary importance, causing SDD to deviate by 71

Abstract = {{Alternate bars are important features in alluvial channels as they
   determine flow and transport patterns.  They appear fundamental to
   selection of meander wavelengths and the geometry of bends.  Bend flow
   has been studied extensively:  far less study has been made of flow over
   alternate bars.  Field results from Solfatara Creek, a 5.2-m-wide,
   0.2-0.7-m-deep gravel bed channel where flow exits an upstream bend and
   shoals over a bar in a straight reach, are used to examine patterns of
   flow and the fluid forces determining the flow field.  Large
   cross-sectional area changes, tied primarily to variation in depth,
   force large stream-wise accelerations and substantial cross-stream flow
   off the central bar.  The topographically driven downstream and
   cross-stream accelerations are sufficiently large that their influence
   upon the balance of forces is of the same order as the pressure gradient
   and the boundary shear stress.  The importance of convective
   accelerations in the downstream flow equation in this straight reach
   concurs with bend flow results, but the similar importance of convective
   accelerations in the cross-stream equation contrasts with results from
   bend flow.  While part of the difference may be attributed to the lower
   stage conditions herein, in the absence of significant curvature change
   the cross-stream force balance depends upon the flow going over and
   around the bar.  Local boundary shear stress estimated from the
   law-of-the-wall and a roughness algorithm decreases out of the upstream
   bend, increases over the bar top to values approaching the threshold for
   motion, and then decreases in deeper flow.  Strong bed surface
   coarsening maintains the topography in a stress field that would
   otherwise lead to planation of the bar top and filling of the deeper
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{The coupled saturated-unsaturated flow that results from a horizontal
   pressurized water-filled cylindrical cavity is studied, under the
   assumption of quasilinearization for the unsaturated flow, using a
   combined boundary element-finite element method.  Earlier work on this
   problem considered infiltration under hydrostatic pressure alone.  That
   work is extended here by the inclusion of an additional pressure head in
   the cavity.  Detailed results are calculated for a range of pressure
   heads and dimensionless cavity radii, and the size of the saturated
   region as a function of these two parameters is illustrated.  These show
   that even for small cavities and comparatively high pressure heads,
   gravity effects cannot be ignored.  The calculations also reveal a
   linear relationship between the flux from the cavity and the applied
   pressure head, with the slope of this line varying approximately as the
   two-thirds power of the dimensionless cavity radius.}},

Abstract = {{One result of increased scientific and public interest in water quality
   over the past few decades has been the gradua accumulation of reliable
   long-term water quality data records and an interest in examining these
   data for long-term trends.  This paper summarizes and examines some of
   the major issues and choices involved in detecting and estimating the
   magnitude of temporal trends in measures of stream water quality.  The
   first issue is the type of trend hypothesis to examine:  step trends
   versus monotonic trend.  The second relates to the general category of
   statistical methods to employ:  parametric versus nonparametric.  The
   third issue relates to the kind of data to analyze:  concentration data
   versus flux data.  The fourth relates to issues of data manipulation to
   achieve the best results from the trend analysis.  These issues include
   the use of mathematical transformations of the data and the removal of
   natural sources of variability in water quality due to seasonal and
   stream discharge variations.  The final issue relates to the choice of a
   trend technique for the analysis of data records with censored or ``less
   than{''} values.  The authors' experiences during the past decade with
   the development of several trend detection techniques and application of
   these techniques to a large number of water quality records provide
   insight into the issues related to a choice of a statistical test for
   trend in water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Analytic functions are superimposed to model three-dimensional steady
   groundwater flow in regions containing one or more inhomogeneities
   shaped like prolate or oblate ellipsoids of revolution.  Each function
   and the sum of such functions are solutions of Laplace's equation, the
   governing differential equation for steady groundwater flow.  The
   functions are implemented in manner that provides exact continuity of
   flow across the entire boundary of each inhomogeneity.  In general,
   continuity of head is provided at specified control points on the
   boundary and is approximated between control points.  For the case of
   one inhomogeneity in a uniform flow field, it turns out that there is
   exact continuity of head across the entire surface of the inhomogeneity.
   The method is implemented in a computer program written by the author. 
   Two applications are demonstrated:  (1) flow to a gravel-packed well and
   (2) flow through a series of lens-shaped inhomogeneities.  The examples
   demonstrate that the approximation of continuity of head can be made
   acceptable for many problems.  A possible application of the techique
   would be testing various theories regarding contaminant migration and
   dispersion by simulating flow and chemical diffusion through large
   numbers of lens-shaped inhomogeneities.}},

Abstract = {{A model for the velocity field over a poorly sorted bed is derived
   herein and applied to flow in steep streams with coarse gravel beds.  In
   such streams, large clasts often are comparable in size to stream depth
   and act as obstacles to the flow.  The effect of these obstacles on a
   flow is estimated by partitioning total stress, proportional to the
   depth-slope product, into a purely fluid component and a form-drag
   component associated with flow around the obstacles.  An eddy viscosity
   closure is used, with a length scale dependent on both distance from the
   boundary and wake dimension.  Resulting velocity profiles agree well
   with profiles measured by Marchand et al.  (1984) in nine mountain
   streams in Colorado.  Model runs for a range of conditions reveal that
   the velocity distribution depends primarily on D84z and flow depth h;
   D84z is the length of the vertically oriented axis of clasts at the 84th
   percentile of the grain size distribution.  Calculated values of mean
   velocity, normalized by shear velocity, are well represented by a simple
   log linear relationship in terms of relative roughness D84/h.}},

Abstract = {{A new method of measuring the longitudinal dispersion coefficient is
   described, based on the decay of a step function in a water quality
   profile near the junction of a tributary with a tidal river.  The method
   requires frequent data during a tidal cycle, so that the slope of the
   profile at different times can be estimated and compared with the
   theoretical slope at the same stage of the cycle.  Applications to two
   tributaries of the Brisbane River are described, in which salinity and
   dissolved-oxygen data are utilized.  In the larger tributary the
   coefficient was about 27 m2 s-1 averaged over the tidal cycle.  In the
   smaller tributary the coefficient was about 10 m2 s-1, and a variation
   in the coefficient during the tidal cycle was indicated.}},

Abstract = {{Since the mid-1930s a variety of soil conservation practices have been
   applied to agricultural lands throughout the United States.  While
   intended to reduce soil erosion, if effective, these practices should
   alter the hydrology of streams which drain the treated lands.  This
   hypothesis was explored for the East Branch of the Pecatonica River, a
   gaged 221 square mile agricultural catchment in southwestern Wisconsin. 
   On the basis of the analysis of peak and daily flow data there has been
   a decrease in flood peaks and in winter/spring flood volumes and an
   increase in hydrologic rise times and in the contribution of
   winter/spring snowmelt events to base flow.  These changes do not appear
   to be due to climatic variations, reservoir construction, or major land
   use changes.  Instead, they appear to have resulted from the adoption of
   various soil conservation practices, particularly those involving the
   treatment of gullies and the adoption of conservation tillage.}},

Abstract = {{A multiplexing time domain reflectometry (TDR) system for real-time
   monitoring of volumetric soil moisture content was developed.  The
   system was tested at a remote field site in the Hubbard Brook
   Experimental Forest in New Hampshire.  The average value of soil
   moisture content in the top 500 mm of soil was measured every 4 hours
   for 1 year at 12 locations within a 12- by 18-m plot.  The system
   functioned well except when the air temperature dropped below -
   15-degrees-C, which caused the data logger tape recorder to stop. 
   Calibrations run on undisturbed soil cores did not compare well with
   published curves developed for mineral soils, probably because of high
   soil organic matter content.  The standard error of estimate of soil
   moisture content, indicated by the calibrations, was 0.02 cm3/cm3.  The
   standard deviation of repeated moisture content measurements made in the
   field was 0.003 cm3/cm3.  The effect of cable length on the TDR signal
   was investigated.  It was found that long cables tend to attenuate the
   signal, ultimately making the measurement impractical.  However, cable
   length had little effect on the calibration up to a length of 27 m.  The
   coefficient of variation of the moisture content measurements taken at
   any given time ranged from 0.12 to 0.21 during the test period.  As
   predicted by a stochastic analysis of soil moisture flow in
   heterogeneous soil, the spatial variability of the measurements
   decreased as average soil moisture increased.}},

Abstract = {{The water level in an open well tapping a confined formation is
   influenced by natural forces including the solid Earth tide (SET) and
   atmospheric pressure variation (APV).  The spectral method is used to
   analytically derive a model for well response to both random and
   periodic components of the combined SET and APV forcings (CSA).  An
   inverse theory and algorithm are developed in order to provide improved
   results when using the model to estimate the hydraulic parameters
   associated with a given formation.  An examination of the response
   surface of the estimation criterion reveals a uniqueness problem in
   estimating storativity (S).  Since there is little correlation between
   the transmissivity (T) and S estimators, a good estimate for T is still
   possible independent of having accurate knowledge of S.  An estimate of
   T is possible only if the data contain sufficient information so that
   the analysis occurs within an identifiability window.  The CSA
   estimation methodology is compared to individual SET and APV schemes. 
   The CSA scheme gives the greatest probability that sufficient
   information is contained in a data record so that T is indeed
   indentifiable.  The results of applications to synthetic data indicate
   that the CSA scheme gives a T estimate with the most precision and also
   that it requires collecting fewer observations.  These results are
   discussed in light of practical considerations when designing data
   collection procedures.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale natural gradient tracer experiment was conducted on Cape
   Cod, Massachusetts, to examine the transport and dispersion of solutes
   in a sand and gravel aquifer.  The nonreactive tracer, bromide, and the
   reactive tracers, lithium and molybdate, were injected as a pulse in
   July 1985 and monitored in three dimensions as they moved as far as 280
   m down-gradient through an array of multilevel samplers.  The bromide
   cloud moved horizontally at a rate of 0.42 m per day.  It also moved
   downward about 4 m because of density-induced sinking early in the test
   and accretion of areal recharge from precipitation.  After 200 m of
   transport, the bromide cloud had spread more than 80 m in the direction
   of flow, but was only 14 m wide and 4-6 m thick.  The lithium and
   molybdate clouds followed the same path as the bromide cloud, but their
   rates of movement were retarded about 50\% relative to bromide movement
   because of sorption onto the sediments.}},

   change in the bromide longitudinal variance was observed during the
   first 26 m of travel distance, but afterward the variance followed a
   linear trend, indicating the longitudinal dispersivity had reached a

Abstract = {{Tests of a one-dimensional sampling design methodology on measurements
   of bromide concentration collected during the natural gradient tracer
   test conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey on Cape Cod, Massachusetts,
   demonstrate its efficacy for field studies of solute transport in
   groundwater and the utility of one-dimensional analysis.  The
   methodology was applied to design of sparse two-dimensional networks of
   fully screened wells typical of those often used in engineering
   practice.  In one-dimensional analysis, designs consist of the
   downstream distances to rows of wells oriented perpendicular to the
   groundwater flow direction and the timing of sampling to be carried out
   on each row.  The power of a sampling design is measured by its
   effectiveness in simultaneously meeting objectives of model
   discrimination, parameter estimation, and cost minimization. 
   One-dimensional models of solute transport, differing in processes
   affecting the solute and assumptions about the structure of the flow
   field, were considered for description of tracer cloud migration.  When
   fitting each model using nonlinear regression, additive and
   multiplicative error forms were allowed for the residuals which consist
   of both random and model errors.  The one-dimensional single-layer model
   of a nonreactive solute with multiplicative error was judged to be the
   best of those tested.  Results show the efficacy of the methodology in
   designing sparse but powerful sampling networks.  Designs that sample
   five rows of wells at five or fewer times in any given row performed as
   well for model discrimination as the full set of samples taken up to
   eight times in a given row from as many as 89 rows.  Also, designs for
   parameter estimation judgded to be good by the methodology were as
   effective in reducing the variance of parameter estimates as arbitrary
   designs with many more samples.  Results further showed that estimates
   of velocity and longitudinal dispersivity in one-dimensional models
   based on data from only five rows of fully screened wells each sampled
   five or fewer times were practically equivalent to values determined
   from moments analysis of the complete three-dimensional set of 29,285
   samples taken during 16 sampling times.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment is reported which monitored the three-dimensional
   movement of cubic solute plumes through an unsaturated, loamy sand soil.
   The plumes were created with one of two methods, a two-dimensional flux
   application and an initial resident distribution.  Soil coring was used
   to sample resident concentrations for the three solutes studied.  The
   data were analyzed using the method of moments.  In addition to the
   solute transport experiments, a detailed set of physical properties of
   the field was obtained by excavating three pits to a depth of 5.0 m and
   also by taking soil cores throughout the study area.  This paper
   explains the experimental methodology, summarizes the relevant site
   characteristics, and describes the observed transport based on the
   zeroth and first order spatial moments.  Mass balance varied between 78
   and 138\%.  The field-averaged gravimetric water content and dry bulk
   density were used to accurately predict the mean vertical plume
   displacements.  The plumes spread relatively little in the horizontal
   direction.}},

Abstract = {{Solute plumes were created in an unsaturated field soil with either flux
   application or by leaching an initial resident distribution (see
   Ellsworth et al., this issue).  The spatial variance of the plumes
   initially increased with time between the soil surface and a depth of
   2.5 m, within which the soil was a nearly structureless loamy sand. 
   Below this depth, the plumes were observed to compress in the vertical
   direction as they moved into, and through, a region of subangular blocky
   structure and loam texture (between 2.5 and 4.0 m depth).  As the solute
   moved below the layer of fine texture, the plume variance again
   increased with time.  Using a transformed advection-dispersion equation
   description, two constant, field-averaged transport coefficients, V{*}
   and D{*}zz, were determined in a scaled coordinate system from the
   moment equations.  These two constant parameters were then used to
   predict the observed local, or plot scale, transport.  Results indicate
   that the two constant parameters describe transport reasonably well at
   each plot site and over all sampling depths.}},

Abstract = {{A decision support system (DSS) is developed to help decision makers
   analyze the economic, social, and ecological ramifications of water

   conservation and reallocation (i.e., transfers).  The DSS is composed of
   three main modules:  (1) a conjunctive surface-ground water model, (2)
   the impact analysis segment which uses a geographical information system
   that integrates model output with information from the study area to
   estimate economic, social, and ecological impacts, and (3) a
   multicriteria decision making algorithm that ranks the transfer schemes
   based on trade-offs of indicators which are assembled into a
   hierarchical structure.  A case study in which 10 different water
   transfer alternatives are examined is provided to demonstrate an
   application of the proposed DSS.}},

Abstract = {{The time-averaged concentration of hydrocarbon and oxygen vapors were
   measured in the unsaturated zone above the residually contaminated
   capillary fringe at the U.S.  Coast Guard Air Station in Traverse City,
   Michigan.  Total hydrocarbon and oxygen vapor concentrations were
   observed over a 13-month period.  Supplementary gain size, porosity, and
   moisture content data support the assumption of a uniform, homogeneous
   site geology which, in view of the planar hydrocarbon source term,
   abundant oxygen, and sparse data base, is suitable for simple analytical
   modeling.  In the assumed absence of advection, leaching, and
   transience, the analysis is a straight-forward balance of gaseous
   diffusion and biological degradation coupled stoichiometrically in the
   two reacting constituents.  Volatilization is shown to be a significant
   transport mechanism for hydrocarbons at Traverse City, and

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to assess the potential significance of
   deviations from local equilibrium for the exchange of mass between
   residual nonaqueous phase liquids and the aqueous phase in the saturated
   groundwater zone.  A one-dimensional convection-dispersion mass balance
   equation incorporating a first-order interphase mass transfer rate
   relationship and temporal changes in blob configuration is used to model
   this system.  Analytical and numerical methods are employed to examine
   the steady state and transient behavior of the system under a variety of
   hypothetical aquifer conditions and pumping remediation schemes. 
   Sensitivity of the model to several parameters including mass transfer
   coefficient, blob size and shape, and Darcy velocity is explored. 
   Results of the theoretical assessment indicate that nonequilibrium
   effects could play a significant role in some contamination scenarios,
   primarily for large blob sizes and relatively high velocities.  Design
   of soil flushing techniques will be impacted by these conclusions. 
   Uncertainty in several parameter values used in this analysis indicate
   the need for further experimental investigation of this process.}},

Abstract = {{In a small boreal forest lake, the subice circulation of waters from
   five distinct origins (lake premelt water, lakeshore snowpack meltwater,
   ice cover meltwater, groundwater and hillslope through-flow water) was
   studied during the spring melt period.  A network of collared access
   holes was used to monitor the temperature, conductivity and pH profiles
   of the water column beneath the ice cover.  The study also included the
   tracing of snowbank meltwaters and through-flow waters with rhodamine. 
   Conductivity and pH appeared to be efficient parameters for
   discriminating most of the water types considered.  During the spring
   melt three distinct low-pH episodes were recorded at the lake outflow. 
   The first episode (pH 5) occurred in the early melt period; snow and ice
   meltwaters layered beneath the ice forming a stratum almost-equal-to 20
   cm thick.  It moved toward the outlet under laminar flow conditions
   (observed average velocity, 1m/h).  Two subsequent pH episodes of pH 5.3
   and 5.1 were observed during the massive melt period.  These episodes
   were due to peak flows of hillslope through flow which entered the lake
   and formed a layer 20-40 cm thick in the water column (observed average
   velocity, greater than 20 m/h).  The ice cover thus not only modified
   the nearshore water quality by inducing thermal layering but also
   strongly influenced the quality of the outflow waters due to the
   segregation and rapid evacuation of the through flow and surface
   meltwaters.}},

Abstract = {{A method of precipitation simulation that incorporates climatological
   information has been developed.  A Markovian-based model is used to
   generate temporal sequences of six daily weather types:  high pressure;
   coastal return; maritime tropical return; frontal maritime tropical
   return; cold frontal overrunning; and warm frontal overrunning. 
   Precipitation values are assigned to individual days by using observed
   statistical relations between weather types and precipitation
   characteristics.  When this method was applied to an area in the
   Delaware River basin, the statistics describing average precipitation,
   extreme precipitation, and drought conditions for simulated
   precipitation closely matched those of the observed data.  Potential
   applications of this weather type precipitation model include climatic
   change research and modeling of temperature and evapotranspiration.}},

Abstract = {{Distributions of distance of bedload particle movement were examined in
   two gravel bed streams using several hundred magnetically tagged cobbles
   and pebbles.  The compound Poisson model of Einstein-Hubbell-Sayre and a
   simple gamma function model were compared with observed distributions of
   moved particles, and of all particles.  Both models fit the data
   reasonably well for small mean displacements, but notable misfits
   occurred in an event with large mean displacement.  When mean particle
   travel distance approaches the scale of bar spacing, trapping in the
   bars interrupts particle progress and the dispersion process.  The data
   remain very noisy, so definitive discrimination of suitable models will
   require trails with more than 10(3) particles.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrologic response of a channel network is defined by decomposing
   the process of runoff formation into two distinct contributions, one
   accounting for the mechanisms of travel time within individual reaches
   (hydrodynamic dispersion), and the other accounting for the morphology
   of the network structure (geomorphological dispersion).  Exact Laplace
   transforms of first passage time distributions at the outlet of a
   network are obtained by a consistent approximation of travel time
   distributions through individual reaches.  The moments of such
   distributions are obtained analytically in the general case. 
   Closed-form first-passage distributions are obtained in the particular
   case of basin-constant hydrodynamic dispersion.  The variance of the
   resulting travel time distributions is shown in this paper to be made up
   of two additive contributions corresponding to the two dispersion
   mechanisms considered.  The geomorphologic dispersion coefficient is
   shown to depend on the ratios of bifurcation, length and area of the
   network suggesting that, at the scale of an organized network,
   heterogeneities other than those related to the convection field shape
   the dispersive character of transport.  In particular, a significant
   application of the general solution to Hortonian channel networks
   suggests that models based on accurate specification of the geometry and
   the topology of the network and a simplified dynamics capture the
   foremost features of the travel time distributions in a broad range of
   dispersivities within individual reaches.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on a B horizon soil from Maine have been conducted to determine
   the weathering rate dependence on hydrogen ion concentration in soil
   solution.  Effects of soil concentration and solution chemistry on
   chemical weathering rate were also investigated.  Studies were conducted
   using a laboratory pH-stat semicontinuous reactor at pH 2.7 and 3.5 for
   two concentrations of B horizon soil.  Homogenized B horizon soil in the
   size range 63-125-mu-m was washed in deionized water and acetone and
   used without further treatment.  Results obtained from titrations of 10,
   30, and 100 g/L of soil at a constant pH of 2.7 suggest that the
   weathering rate, expressed in mu-eq H+/hr/g soil, does not depend on the
   soil concentration in the pH-stat reactor.  In order to test the effect
   of solute concentration on weathering rate, experiments were performed
   at two different concentrations of accumulated solutes.  Weathering
   rates were the same at the two solute concentrations, indicating that
   significant back reactions were not likely occurring.  The weathering
   rate at pH 2.7 was estimated in the range 0.53-0.93 mu-eq H+/hr/g soil,
   at pH 3.0 as 0.52 mu-eq H+/hr/g soil, at pH 3.5 as 0.36 mu-eq H+/hr/g
   soil, and at pH 4.0 as 0.04 mu-eq H+/hr/g soil.  Assuming a weathering
   rate proportional to \{H+\}m, the fractional order m was determined to
   be approximately 0.8.  Results were consistent with a
   surface-reaction-controlled dissolution mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{A complete reexamination of Sudicky's (1986) field experiment for the
   geostatistical characterization of hydraulic conductivity at the Borden
   aquifer in Ontario, Canada is performed.  The sampled data reveal that a
   number of outliers (low In (K) values) are present in the data base. 
   These low values cause difficulties in both variogram estimation and
   determining population statistics.  The analysis shows that assuming
   either a normal distribution or exponential distribution for log
   conductivity is appropriate.  The classical, Cressie/Hawkins and squared
   median of the absolute deviations (SMAD) estimators are used to compute
   experimental variograms.  None of these estimators provides completely
   satisfactory variograms for the Borden data with the exception of the
   classical estimator with outliers removed from the data set. 
   Theoretical exponential variogram parameters are determined from
   nonlinear (NL) estimation.  Differences are obtained between NL fits and
   those of Sudicky (1986).  For the classical-screened estimated
   variogram, NL fits produce an In (K) variance of 0.24, nugget of 0.07,
   and integral scales of 5.1 m horizontal and 0.21 m vertical along A-A'. 
   For B-B' these values are 0.37, 0.11, 8.3 and 0.34.  The fitted
   parameter set for B-B' data (horizontal and vertical) is statistically
   different than the parameter set determined for A-A'.  We also evaluate
   a probabilistic form of Dagan's (1982, 1987) equations relating
   geostatistical parameters to a tracer cloud's spreading moments.  The
   equations are evaluated using the parameter estimates and covariances
   determined from line A-A' as input, with a velocity equal to 9.0 cm/day.
   The results are compared with actual values determined from the field
   test, but evaluated by both Freyberg (1986) and Rajaram and Gelhar
   (1988).  The geostatistical parameters developed from this study produce
   an excellent fit to both sets of calculated plume moments when combined
   with Dagan's stochastic theory for predicting the spread of a tracer
   cloud.}},

Abstract = {{Aquifer cleanup efforts at contaminated sites frequently involve
   operation of a system of extraction wells.  It has been found that
   contaminant load discharged by extraction wells typically declines with
   time, asymptotically approaching a residual level.  Such behavior could
   be due to rate-limited desorption of an organic contaminant from aquifer
   solids.  An analytical model is presented which accounts for
   rate-limited desorption of an organic solute during cleanup of a
   contaminated site.  Model equations are presented which describe
   transport of a sorbing contaminant in a converging radial flow field,
   with sorption described by (1) equilibrium, (2) first-order rate, and
   (3) Fickian diffusion expressions.  The model equations are solved in
   the Laplace domain and numerically inverted to simulate contaminant
   concentrations at an extraction well.  A Laplace domain solution for the
   total contaminant mass remaining in the aquifer is also derived.  It is
   shown that rate-limited sorption can have a significant impact upon
   aquifer remediation.  Approximate equivalence among the various
   rate-limited models is also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The water level in a well that penetrates a confined aquifer can
   fluctuate in response to changes in atmospheric pressure.  The response
   varies with the well casing and screen dimensions, the transmissivity
   and compressibility of the aquifer, and to a small extent, its
   storativity.  Recently this loading-response problem has been solved in
   terms of a frequency response function that characterizes how
   attenuation and phase shifts in the response signal vary with frequency.
   The counterpart of this solution in the time domain is an impulse
   response function.  This solution has the immediate appeal that it can
   be directly to filter raw loading and water level records via serial
   convolution, where the response at any time is a weighted aggregate of
   the previous loading signal.  The impulse response function derives from
   well-known solutions to the slug test problem.  When based on the
   Cooper-Bredehoeft-Papadopulos solution, the response function is precise
   but computationally intensive.  Based on the Hvorslev solution, the
   response function is computationally simple, but applicable only to
   aquifers with small storativity.  Simulations and a field example
   clearly illustrate the dominating influence of transmissivity in
   dempening and lagging the response of a confined aquifer to a loading
   signal, and how both effects increase with higher frequency.  The
   results also illustrate the weak influence of storativity in modulating
   the response signal.}},

Title = {{AN IMPROVED ANALYSIS OF GRAVITY DRAINAGE EXPERIMENTS FOR ESTIMATING THE

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The unsaturated hydraulic properties are important parameters in any
   quantitative description of water and solute transport in partially
   saturated soils.  Currently, most in situ methods for estimating the
   unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) are based on analyses that
   require estimates of the soil water flux and the pressure head gradient.
   These analyses typically involve differencing of field-measured pressure
   head (h) and volumetric water content (theta) data, a process that can
   significantly amplify instrumental and measurement errors.  More
   reliable methods result when differencing of field data can be avoided. 
   One such method is based on estimates of the gravity drainage curve
   K'(theta) = dK/d-theta which may be computed from observations of theta
   and/or h during the drainage phase of infiltration drainage experiments
   assuming unit gradient hydraulic conditions.  The purpose of this study
   was to compare estimates of the unsaturated soil hydraulic functions on
   the basis of different combinations of field data theta, h, K, and K'. 
   Five different data sets were used for the analysis:  (1) theta-h, (2)
   K-theta, (3) K'-theta; (4) K-theta-h, and (5) K'-theta-h.  The analysis
   was applied to previously published data for the Norfolk, Troup, and
   Bethany soils.  The K-theta-h and K'-theta-h data sets consistently
   produced nearly identical estimates of the hydraulic functions.  The
   k-theta and K'-theta data also resulted in similar curves, although
   results in this case were less consistent than those produced by the
   K-theta-h and K'-theta-h data sets.  We conclude from this study that
   differencing of field data can be avoided and hence that there is no
   need to calculate soil water fluxes and pressure head gradients from
   inherently noisy field-measured theta and h data.  The gravity drainage
   analysis also provides results over a much broader range of hydraulic
   conductivity values than is possible with the more standard
   instantaneous profile analysis, especially when augmented with
   independently measured soil water retention data.}},

Abstract = {{The reliability of groundwater quality management algorithms is limited
   in large part by the uncertainty present in the model parameters. 
   Because the field parameter measurement costs and the remediation costs
   must be supplied by the same financial source, the classical
   optimization procedure does not minimize the real total remediation
   investment.  This research presents an algorithm able to find the total
   minimum for the sum of both the measurement and the pumping costs.  A
   chance-constrained technique is used to cast the optimization problem in
   stochastic form, relating the concentration covariance matrix to the
   log-transmissivity covariance matrix by means of the transport equations
   and a first-order approximation for the uncertainty.  The simulation
   model solves the steady state flow equations on a finite element
   triangular mesh and the transport equations using the backward method of
   characteristics.  The resulting nonlinearly constrained optimization
   problem is solved using the quasi-linearity algorithm; this algorithm is
   designed to find a good initial point for the local minimum search when
   the feasible domain is not convex.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to investigate the capability of a model,
   which explicitly accounts for multiple sources of nonequilibrium, to
   predict the transport of nonequilibrium sorption-constrained solute in a
   stratified porous medium.  Microaquifer experiments reported in the
   literature served as the source of the data that were analyzed.  The
   best available information was used to identify values for all model
   input parameters, allowing the multiprocess nonequilibrium (MPNE) model
   to be used in a predictive mode.  The prediction produced by the MPNE
   model provided a good description of the breakthrough curve obtained at
   a given velocity.  A breakthrough curve obtained at a slower velocity
   could be simulated when the apparent velocity dependence of the physical
   nonequilibrium parameters was taken into account.  Based on the reported
   results, the MPNE model would seem to provide a valid representation of
   sorption dynamics and solute transport for stratified systems influenced
   by sorption capacity heterogeneity and multiple sources of
   nonequilibrium.  The relative and combined impact of interlayer mass
   transfer, chemical nonequilibrium, and sorption capacity heterogeneity
   on the transport of a sorbing solute was elucidated.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions for computing drawdowns and streamflow depletion
   rates often neglect conditions that exist in typical stream-aquifer
   systems.  These conditions can include (1) partial penetration of the
   aquifer by the stream, (2) presence of a streambed clogging layer, (3)
   aquifer storage available to the pumping well from areas beyond the
   stream, and (4) hydraulic disconnection between the stream and the well.
   A methodology is presented for estimating extended flow lengths and
   other parameters used to approximate the increased head losses created
   by partially penetrating streams and clogging layer resistance effects. 
   The computed stream depletion rates and drawdown distributions from
   several analytical solutions (Theis, 1941; Glover and Balmer, 1954;
   Jacob, 1950; Hantush, 1965) were compared to those obtained using a
   two-dimensional groundwater flow model.  The stream geometry was
   approximated as a semicircle.  Numerical simulation results indicate
   that, because of the use of simplifying assumptions, the analytical
   solutions can misrepresent aquifer drawdown distributions and
   overestimate stream depletion rates.  Assuming that a correct simulation
   of the stream depletion phenomenon is provided by the numerical model,
   the error associated with each of the simplifying assumptions was
   determined.  At a time of 58.5 days after pumping began, errors in
   computed stream depletion rates due to neglect of partial penetration
   were 20\%, those due to neglect of clogging layer resistance were 45\%,
   and those due to neglect of storage in areas beyond the stream were
   21\%.  Neglecting hydraulic disconnection had only a minor effect (i.e.,
   an error of 1\% only at a time of 58.5 days after pumping began) on
   computed stream depletion rates and a noticeable effect on aquifer
   drawdown distributions.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the regional acid-base status of streams in the mid-Atlantic
   and southeastern United States, spring base flow chemistry was surveyed
   in a probability sample of 500 stream reaches representing a population
   of 64,300 reaches (224,000 km).  Approximately half of the streams had
   acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) less-than-or-equal-to 200-mu-eq L-1. 
   Acidic (ANC less-than-or-equal-to 0) streams were located in the
   highlands of the Mid-Atlantic region (southern New York to southern
   Virginia, 2330 km), in coastal lowlands of the Mid-Atlantic (2600 km),
   and in Florida (462 km).  Acidic streams were rare (less than 1\%) in
   the highlands of the Southeast.  Inorganic monomeric aluminum (Al(im))
   concentrations were highest in acidic streams of the Mid-Atlantic
   Highlands where over 70\% of the acidic streams had Al(im) greater than
   100-mu-g L-1, a concentration above which deleterious biological effects
   have frequently been reported.  Dissolved organic carbon concentrations
   were much higher in lowland coastal streams, compared with inland
   streams.  Our data support a hypothesis that atmospheric sources and
   watershed retention control regional patterns in streamwater sulfate
   concentrations.  Most stream watersheds retain the vast majority of the
   total nitrogen loading from wet deposition.  The data suggest, however,
   that some deposition nitrogen may be reaching streams in the Northern
   Appalachians.  These results show that acidic surface waters are found
   outside the glaciated northeastern portions of the United States and
   that watershed sulfate retention is not sufficient to prevent acidic
   conditions in some Mid-Atlantic Highlands streams.}},

Abstract = {{We examined anion composition in National Stream Survey (NSS) data in
   order to evaluate the most probable sources of current acidity in acidic
   and low acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) streams in the eastern United
   States.  Acidic streams that had almost no organic influence (less than
   10\% of total anions) and sulfate and nitrate concentrations indicative
   of evaporative concentration of atmospheric deposition were classified
   as acidic due to acidic deposition.  These acidic streams were located
   in small (< 30 km2) forested watersheds in the Mid-Atlantic Highlands
   (an estimated 1950 km of stream length) and in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal
   Plain (1250 km).  Acidic streams affected primarily by acidic deposition
   but also influenced by naturally occurring organic anions accounted for
   another 1180 km of acidic stream length and were located in the New
   Jersey Pine Barrens, plateau tops in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast
   Highlands, and the Florida Panhandle.  The total length of streams
   acidic due to acid mine drainage in the NSS (4590 km) was about the same
   as the total length of acidic streams likely affected by acidic
   deposition (4380 km).  Acidic streams whose acid anion composition was
   dominated by organics were located in Florida and the Mid-Atlantic
   Coastal Plain.  In Florida, most of the acidic streams were organic
   dominated, whereas about half of the streams in the Mid-Atlantic Coastal
   Plain were organic dominated.  Organic-dominated acidic streams were not
   observed in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast Highlands.}},

Abstract = {{Detention reservoirs in urban drainage systems are provided for reducing
   the peak flows downstream of the reservoir.  The flow reduction is due
   to the storage volume of the reservoir in which the incoming flow is
   temporarily stored.  The relationship between the peak reduction ratio
   (the peak outflow discharge to the peak inflow discharge) and the
   relative storage ratio (maximum volume stored in the reservoir to the
   volume of the inflow hydrograph) is evaluated in this study.  This
   relationship, named the efficiency function, is derived by a numerical
   solution of the dimensionless routing equation.  Using the
   three-parameter gamma distribution to represent the inflow to the
   reservoir, the efficiency functions can be expressed by simple linear
   equations.  Each equation depends on a single parameter whose value is
   determined by the reservoir configuration (depth-storage relationship)
   and the type of the outlet device (e.g., spillway or culvert).  The
   implementation of the efficiency function is most suitable for the
   preliminary design stage where a large number of alternative designs can
   be easily tested without performing the conventional routing procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater sources supply about 38\% of all water uses in the 19
   western states.  Most attention has focused on withdrawals from these
   sources but, in recent years, concerns have been raised about the
   quality of groundwater.  At the federal level, several laws address
   aspects of groundwater quality but protection of this resource has been
   left primarily to the states.  Western state groundwater quality
   protection programs were comprehensively surveyed relating to six
   aspects:  assessment of existing groundwater quality, levels of
   protection established, controls placed on sources of contamination, use
   of special management areas, coordination among the involved agencies,
   and program enforcement.  The survey revealed several promising
   approaches in each of these areas in the western states which are set
   forth in the paper.  Most of these approaches have been established in
   recent years, reflecting the greatly increased state attention to
   groundwater quality protection.  It is too early to evaluate the
   effectiveness of particular approaches.  In general the western states
   are taking a more active role in groundwater quality protection, and
   several states recently have established comprehensive programs for this
   purpose.  Others, however, are still considering approaches to
   protection of groundwater quality and may find the discussion in this
   paper of some use.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of transport of a conservative nonreactive solute in a
   vertical cross section of a hypothetical partially saturated,
   scale-heterogeneous soil under transient water flow was analyzed here. 
   It was assumed that locally the water flow and the solute transport can
   be described by the Richards' equation and by the one-component
   convection dispersion equation, respectively.  The simulated water
   content and the solute concentration distributions in the vertical cross
   section of the soil at different elapsed times were quantified in terms
   of space averages and two-point autocorrelation functions.  The time
   evolution of the solute plume was quantified in terms of its first two
   normalized spatial moments, from which the time dependence of the
   longitudinal and the transverse components of the solute velocity
   vector, and the spatial covariance tensor, were estimated.  The results
   of this study, which are relevant to solute transport at the local or
   the plume scale, demonstrated the considerable variability in the solute
   concentration in space and time, due to the complex heterogeneity of the
   soil hydraulic properties in both the vertical and the horizontal
   directions.  Consequently, the movement of the solute plume was
   characterized by a compression-expansion phenomenon, attributed to the
   decrease in the effective solute velocity through the zones of
   relatively fine-textured soil material.  It was concluded that existing
   stochastic vadose zone transport models may be applicable to shallow
   depths but may fail to describe the actual spread of a solute plume when
   the transport takes place at relatively large depths, mainly because of
   the neglect of the significant vertical heterogeneity in the soil
   hydraulic properties.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a recent study of solute transport in a hypothetical
   scale-heterogeneous soil under transient unsaturated flow conditions
   (Russo, this issue) suggested that the time-dependent components of the
   spatial covariance tensor, based on a single realization of the solute
   concentration in unsaturated flow, are in relatively good agreement with
   the components of the spatial covariance tensor, based on the
   ensemble-average solute concentration derived by Dagan (1984), for
   solute transport under steady saturated flow.  Furthermore, the
   asymptotic value of the longitudinal component of the dispersivity
   tensor lambda-zz, estimated from the horizontally averaged solute
   concentration in the unsaturated flow domain, was found to be in good
   agreement with the asymptotic lambda-zz derived by Dagan (1982, 1984)
   and Gelhar and Axness (1983) for saturated flow.  These findings are
   explored in a general Lagrangian formulation, using small-perturbation,
   first-order approximations.  The results of the analysis of the velocity
   field in the unsaturated flow domain of the hypothetical
   scale-heterogeneous soil of Russo (this issue) suggest that there was
   good agreement between the result of the Lagrangian kinematic analysis
   and the result of the analysis of the spatial moments of the
   concentration distribution, in agreement with the stochastic theory of
   transport in saturated flow.  This is explained by the finding that
   under unsaturated flow conditions there is an increase in the
   variability of the hydraulic conductivity K (and concurrently an
   increase in the variability of the velocity V(z)), accompanied by a
   decrease in the correlation scale of K (and concurrently a decrease in
   the correlation scale of V(z)) relative to the saturated conditions. 
   The increase in the variability of the unsaturated conductivity stemmed
   from the variability in the water content theta and the strong nonlinear
   dependence of K on theta, while the accompanying decrease in its
   correlation scale stemmed from the negative correlation between F = log
   K(s) and theta, which persisted for a relatively large separation
   distance in the longitudinal vertical direction.  Consequently, the
   product between the conductivity variance and its correlation scale is
   of similar magnitude for both saturated and unsaturated flow regimes. 
   The results suggest that in spite of the complexity of unsaturated flow,
   as compared with saturated flow, it might be amenable to a similar
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of past suspended sediment concentration modeling efforts
   have relied on simple regression analysis.  Problems with these models,
   and in particular, sediment rating curves, have been gaining attention
   recently.  It is argued here that many of the problems result from the
   fact that simple regression models are inappropriate for modeling
   fluvial systems because they fail to adequately represent the dynamic
   nature of fluvial processes.  Transfer function models are system models
   which can account for the dynamic nature of fluvial systems.  Single
   input-single output and multiple input-single output transfer function
   models for daily suspended sediment concentration are developed for two
   drainage basins in Iowa.  Interpretation of the models with respect to
   hydrologic theory indicates that model form and parameter estimates can
   be related to drainage basin size, land use, and physiographic
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{A perturbation solution to three-dimensional radial flow in
   heterogeneous porous media is reported on; the analytical solution is in
   terms of the first and second moments of the gradient in the radial
   direction and the specific discharge in this direction.  The solution
   requires evaluation, numerically in the case of this paper, of some
   rather difficult integrals which compose its basic form.  By proper
   adjustment of the statistical anisotropy of the medium, a solution for
   the two-dimensional flow problem can be emulated; the two-dimensional
   solution for the mean and variance in specific discharge resembles
   asymptotes reported earlier by another investigator.  In general, the
   effective hydraulic conductivity, outside a few length scales of the
   well itself, is found to be nearly constant and dependent upon the value
   selected for the statistical anisotropy factor; the variance in specific
   discharge behaves nearly as the inverse square of the distance from the
   well in all cases.}},

Abstract = {{Two indices are presented for assessing the expected responsiveness of
   lakes to changes in external acid inputs.  The first is the ratio of the
   sum of acidic anion to sum of base cation equivalents (C(A)/C(B)), which
   is a familiar index of lake response to past inputs; the second quantity
   is buffer intensity (beta = -dC(A)/dpH), which serves as an index of
   lake pH sensitivity to changes in current inputs.  Because the indices
   account for both capacity and intensity of pH buffering, the approach
   provides greater information on lake responsiveness to acidification
   than the more customary value, acid neutralizing capacity.  The approach
   is applied to water quality data from the Environmental Protection
   Agency's Eastern Lake Survey and preliminary paleolimnological data from
   the PIRLA project (paleolimnological investigation of recent lake
   acidification).  These applications suggest that the approach may yield
   a useful tool with which to evaluate existing data from sites considered
   for monitoring the effects of changing acid inputs on lake systems.}},

Abstract = {{The nonparametric seasonal Kendall's test, and a related multivariate
   test were used to analyze 403 National Stream Quality Accounting Network
   (NASQAN) stations for trend for the period 1978-1987.  Nominal sampling
   frequencies were quarterly or bimonthly.  For all groups and individual
   constituents, trends were detected for only a minority of stations at
   the relatively liberal 10\% significance level.  The groups with the
   greatest percentage of trends were common ions (mostly upward) and
   nutrients and suspended sediment (mostly upward for total nitrogen and
   mostly downward for total phosphorus).  In the pH and alkalinity group,
   the trends were dominantly upward; while this might be the result of
   reductions in atmospheric deposition, this hypothesis is clouded by the
   existence of uptrends in sulfate at many of the same stations.  The
   trace metal analyses showed that the constituents with the greatest
   number of trends (dominantly downward) were arsenic and cadmium; most of
   the stations with downtrends were in the major population areas of the
   east and midwest.  Additional exploratory analyses of possible
   relationships between trends and land use and population did not give
   strong evidence of possible causation.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{The cumulant expansion method, used previously by Sposito and Barry
   (1987) to derive an ensemble average transport equation for a tracer
   moving in a heterogeneous aquifer, is generalized to the case of a
   reactive solute that can adsorb linearly and undergo first-order decay. 
   In the process we also generalize the Van Kampen (1987) result for the
   cumulant expansion of a multiplicative stochastic differential equation
   containing a time-dependent sure matrix.  The resulting partial
   differential equation exhibits terms with field-scale coefficients that
   are analogous to those in the corresponding nonstochastic local-scale
   transport equation.  There are also new terms in the third- and
   fourth-order spatial derivatives of the ensemble average concentration. 
   It is demonstrated that the effective solute velocity for the aqueous
   concentration, not that for the total concentration (aqueous plus
   sorbed), is relevant for a field-scale description of solute transport. 
   The field-scale effective solute velocity, dispersion coefficient,
   retardation factor, and first-order decay parameters, unlike their
   local-scale counterparts, are time-dependent because of autocorrelations
   and cross correlations among the random local solute velocity,
   retardation factor, and first-order decay constant.  It is shown also
   that negative cross correlations between the random tracer solute
   velocity and the inverse of the local retardation factor may produce
   both enhanced dispersion and a temporal growth in the field-scale
   retardation factor.  These effects are possible in any heterogeneous
   aquifer for which a stochastic description of aquifer spatial
   variability is appropriate.}},

Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{The precipitation of Al in aqueous solutions can be described as a
   two-step process.  When acidic inorganic Al solutions (pH 4.5) were
   titrated with NaOH to pH levels between 5.5 and 6.0, an amorphous
   Al(OH)3 (s) phase was formed instantaneously.  During the first 5 min,
   the apparent half time for the reduction in dissolved Al species (t1/2)
   was 0.162 +/- 0.07 hours (n = 4).  The decrease of dissolved Al species
   continued during the following 24 hours, but at a far slower rate (t1/2
   = 55.6 +/- 25 hours (n = 4)).  The highest precipitation rates were
   found in the solution of highest pH, and at approximately identical pH,
   the highest rate was found in the solution of highest temperature.  The
   dissolution of amorphous Al(OH)3 (s) can also be described as a two-step
   process.  When the amorphous Al solutions (pH between 5.5 and 6.0) were
   acidified to pH about 4.5 (HCl), the initial dissolution was relatively
   fast, but not as instantaneous as in the first step of precipitation. 
   The apparent t1/2 after 5 min was estimated to be 0.65 +/- 0.12 hours (n
   = 4).  During the first 2.67 hours (160 min) the dissolution step could
   be described by the equation C(t) = C0e-0.45t, i.e., t1/2 = 1.53 +/-
   0.60 hours (n = 20) according to which the solid Al phase should
   dissolve totally (97\%) during 7.65 hours.  However, after 24 hours of
   storage 40 to 50\% of the original Al(OH)3 (s) remained in the solid
   phase.  This is explained by the presence of a far lower dissolution
   rate in a second step, i.e., the remaining Al(OH)3 (s) was less soluble.
   The average dissolution rate for the rest of the 24-hour period (21.33
   hours) could be described by the exponential function C(t) =
   C0e-0.0095t, i.e., t1/2 = 73.2 +/- 23.4 hours (n = 4).  This implies
   that a total dissolution of Al (97\%) will occur after 15.3 +/- 4.9
   days.  The implications of these findings are discussed with reference
   to the current geochemical models pretending to stimulate and predict
   aluminium chemistry in soils and surface runoff.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the orographical effect for rainfall distribution at a
   storm event is discussed.  The main effect is represented by the
   ground-forced ascending current of air.  A three-dimensional numerical
   model of the hydrostatic atmosphere, including basin orography, is used
   to estimate the ascending current area for any wind direction.  The
   authors also propose a new concept named directional probability of
   storm event (DiPoSE).  A severe storm is more likely to occur when the
   wind blows from a high DiPoSE direction rather than from a low DiPoSE
   direction.  The wind direction at a storm event is determined from a
   DiPoSE analysis and is used in the numerical model.  The calculated
   ascending air region is regarded as a severe rainfall area in
   mountainous river basins.  The results are examined and compared with
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the surface thermal emissivity is necessary for the
   application of thermal infrared remote sensing, which forms the basis
   for water and surface energy balance monitoring from space.  Thermal
   emissivity was measured in the wavelength band 8-14-mu-m for a series of
   representative surfaces within a natural bush-savanna environment
   intermixed with cultivated fields in Botswana.  The measurements were
   performed with an emissivity box, which may be constructed with
   different dimensions to meet the general requirements of the user.  The
   device is well-suited for bare soil, grass, and other types of soil and
   low-vegetation cover combinations.  The measured emissivity varied
   between 0.914 for bare soil (loamy sand) and 0.986 for a surface
   completely covered with savanna shrub (Euclea undulata).  Calculations
   are based on the measurements of the radiative surface temperature of
   three different reflecting configurations of the box.  Repetitive
   estimates of the emissivity were found to be very reproducible for the
   same surface types and showed the large spatial variability of surface
   emissivity within the study area.  This paper describes the emissivity
   box together with other versions of the box concept found in the
   literature, and it describes the operation and calibration procedure as
   well as the results and consequences of the emissivity measurements for
   the application of thermal infrared remote sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Mandelbrot's (1982) hypothesis that river length is fractal has been
   recently substantiated by Hjelmfelt (1988) using eight rivers in
   Missouri.  The fractal dimension of river length, d, is derived here
   from the Horton's laws of network composition.  This results in a simple
   function of stream length and stream area ratios, that is, d = max (1, 2
   log R(L)/log R(A).  Three case studies are reported showing this
   estimate to be coherent with measurements of d obtained from map
   analysis.  The scaling properties of the network as a whole are also
   investigated, showing the fractal dimension of river network, D, to
   depend upon bifurcation and stream area ratios according to D = min (2,
   2 log R(B)/log R(A)).  These results provide a linkage between
   quantitative analysis of drainage network composition and scaling
   properties of river networks.}},

Abstract = {{We combined field, laboratory, and modeling efforts to construct a
   process-oriented N budget for a tidal freshwater wetland in eastern
   Massachusetts.  The emergent marsh contained most of the total N in the
   wetland because of its large area and high N mass per unit area.  Total
   N stored in live marsh plants, dead litter, and inorganic interstitial
   water were roughly similar and 50-500 x less than total peat N.  A
   simple input-output budget indicated that most of the N entering the
   wetland annually passes through the ecosystem unaltered; a relatively
   small amount of N is imported from the river by the marsh.  In the short
   term, mineralization of peat N is sufficient to satisfy N demands within
   the marsh.  Mineralized N is conserved by plant uptake, microbial
   immobilization, and litter immobilization.  The small net N exchange
   with the river does provide an important subsidy to the marsh over the
   long term, offsetting losses due to denitrification and burial.  Tidal
   freshwater wetlands may not appear to be influenced by current water
   quality and yet may respond to long-term cumulative nutrient loading,
   especially when this loading increases because of incremental watershed
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between free surface and seepage face under steady
   conditions of flow has been analyzed for radial and planar flow
   configurations. The numerical studies, carried out with a
   saturated-unsaturated flow model, included the simulation of a series of
   experimental observations documented by Hall (1955). The numerical
   analysis took into consideration effects of capillary fringe, model
   geometry, as well as converging and diverging patterns of flow. For the
   control series of three cases studied, discharge rates, free surface
   location, seepage face height and the spatial distribution of potentials
   closely matched the experimental observations. Additional parametric
   studies showed that converging patterns of flow favor more pronounced
   development of seepage face than divergent flows. In two-dimensional
   planar flow, larger drawdowns tend to favor relatively more pronounced
   development of seepage face. Comparison of the detailed simulation
   results (taking unsaturated flow into consideration) with results
   generated using Dupuit-Forchheimer assumptions suggest that the latter
   may provide discharge estimates that are in error by 12 to 20\% both for
   radial and for two-dimensional planar flows.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative descriptions of two-phase flow in the subsurface require
   knowledge of the capillary pressure-saturation relationships.  The
   effect of interfacial forces on the drainage capillary
   pressure-saturation relationship for organic liquid-water systems is
   usually expressed by the ratio of the liquid-liquid interfacial tensions
   as given by Leverett's (1941) function.  To assess the appropriateness
   of this approach for primary drainage of organic liquid-water systems
   typical of hazardous waste sites and to evaluate its extendability to
   spontaneous imbibition, measurements were made of these relationships
   for various immiscible liquid systems in unconsolidated sand.  The
   results showed increasing deviations with decreasing interfacial forces
   between the measured values and those predicted by a ratio of
   interfacial tensions.  To improve the predictive capability of
   Leverett's function, forms including the intrinsic contact angle and
   roughness were examined.  Scaling of the capillary pressure
   relationships was best achieved by including a correction for both
   interface curvature and roughness.  These corrections became significant
   for drainage for contact angles larger than 35-degrees-55-degrees, and
   for imbibition for contact angles larger than 15-degrees-25-degrees. 
   None of the forms of Leverett's function examined predicted the
   increased residual saturation with decreasing interfacial forces
   observed in this study.  Consequently, their ability to scale the
   measured data was predicated on posing the saturation of the wetting
   phase in terms of the variable effective saturation.}},

Abstract = {{Although the Bureau of Reclamation adopted a new mission as a water
   management agency, social purposes of the mission and methods of
   accomplishing the purposes remain undefined.  A broad consensus agrees
   that a central feature of the agency's management program should be
   irrigation water conservation.  This paper describes three purposes of
   irrigation water conservation:  achieving economic efficiency of water
   allocation, improving environmental quality of western river systems,
   and satisfying outstanding Native American water claims.  Five policy
   instruments are described as alternative methods of inducing
   conservation:  quantity-based regulation, price-based regulation,
   transferable water use permits, conservation subsidies, and
   decentralization of ownership of Reclamation facilities.  Two findings
   are:  (1) price-based regulation may not produce water conservation and
   (2) conservation policy instruments should be chosen with reference to
   their ability to achieve the purposes of federal water conservation
   policy.  An example illustrates quantitative effects on farm income of
   the alternative instruments.}},

Abstract = {{An informal analysis of readily available time series data relevant to
   urban water use in Tucson, Arizona, is presented as an illustration of
   how a management-oriented empirical analysis, structured with general
   knowledge of the results of formal econometric studies, can produce
   useful insights for making applied price policy.  Precise estimates of
   urban water demand price and income elasticities are not required in
   order to achieve conservation-oriented goals.  In the Tucson experience,
   annual water price increases equal to the rate of inflation plus
   approximately the rate of change in real per capita income would have
   been necessary just to maintain constant rather than increasing water
   use.  Given the actual price policy, it is not surprising that Tucson
   has not achieved its mandated conservation goal.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of reactive solute in individual fractures is investigated. 
   Solute advection is coupled with matrix diffusion that is assumed
   perpendicular to the fracture plane.  Fluid advection in the fracture is
   viewed as intersecting flow paths, whereby the advection velocity of a
   solute particle varies along individual streamlines.  Solute mass
   arrival at a fixed position averaged in the direction perpendicular to
   the mean flow is examined.  The dispersion in the solute breakthrough
   arises because of the different advection travel times and varying mass
   flux along individual streamlines.  The fracture is conceptualized as a
   two-dimensional porous medium with a statistically anisotropic,
   spatially varying transmissivity with a given correlation structure; the
   assumed anisotropy condition is consistent with elongated, channel-like
   flow paths that have been observed in single fractures.  Approximate
   expressions for the first two moments of solute travel time are used to
   illustrate the sensitivity to different correlation models for the
   fracture transmissivity.  In particular, the finite correlation scale
   model, the self-similar (fGn) model, and the channel model are
   considered.  The expected cumulative mass arrival is more sensitive to
   the assumed correlation model for lower rates of matrix diffusion.  The
   derived expression for the mass arrival can also be used for analyzing
   the effect of nonequilibrium sorption-desorption reactions in single
   fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Covariance analysis was used to determine the reduction in rainfall
   forecast and estimation variances offered by radar reflectivity data. 
   Covariance analysis of a particular nonadvective linear physically based
   model indicated that the utility of the radar reflectivity data of
   various elevation angles is limited in mean areal rainfall predictions,
   even when a very small density of rain gauges exists over the region of
   interest and good quality radar data are used.  This applies to both raw
   reflectivity and radar rainfall data converted through a Z-R
   relationship.  The ratio of mean areal rainfall prediction variances,
   defined as variance with radar data divided by variance without radar
   data, was found to be greater than 0.8 in most cases.  On the other

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes, major elements, trace elements, and noble gases in
   groundwater from northern Mali permit a reconstruction of the
   paleohydrology of the Sahelian and sub-Saharan regions of west Africa. 
   Major floods of the Niger River during the more humid episodes of the
   Holocene, probably associated with northward migration of the interior
   river delta (flood zone), were responsible for groundwater recharge.  A
   marine aerosol imput, somewhat modified by rock-water interaction,
   dominates the groundwater chemistry.  Stable isotope compositions
   distinguish the Saharan zone groundwater from waters recharged in the
   Sahelian zone south of the Azaouad ridge.  Carbon 14 dating shows that
   whereas the latter are modern, the Saharan zone was recharged in the
   Early to Middle Holocene.  Noble gas contents suggest that recharge
   north of Azaouad occurred under cooler climatic conditions than
   presently prevail.}},

Abstract = {{Two mass balance equations were used to model the transfer of dissolved
   chemicals from the soil solution to the surface runoff water and
   transport of these chemicals to the field outlet end.  One mass balance
   equation is written for the chemicals dissolved in the overland water,
   and the other for the chemicals within the soil profile.  The chemical
   input into the surface runoff water is by the rate-limited convective
   mass transfer process.  Two time scales are isolated:  the slow time
   scale represents the diffusion-based mass transfer process and the fast
   time scale represents the convective transport of dissolved chemicals by
   overland flow.  Scaling the mass balance equations for the slow time
   scale yields a small parameter, which multiplies the time derivative of
   the mass balance equation written for the overland flow, providing a
   singular perturbation problem.  By using the method of matched
   asymptotic expansion, an inner and outer problem is formulated and
   solved for each order of approximation.  A single composite expansion,
   uniformly valid over the entire domain, is derived analytically.  This
   approximated solution was compared with an exact analytical solution for
   the case in which chemicals are initially uniformly distributed
   throughout a semi-infinite soil profile.  The time scale method was then
   used to solve a more complicated problem in which chemicals are
   initially distributed within a certain soil surface layer of a
   semi-infinite soli profile.}},

Abstract = {{Regional scale latent heat flux (LE) was estimated from rawinsonde
   soundings of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over the Konza tallgrass
   prairie in July 1986.  Two approaches were used to calculate LE: 
   similarity theory and an algebraic solution of a conservation equation
   for water vapor in the PBL.  Nine of the soundings were complete. 
   However, the latter five soundings only recovered data for every sixth
   possible level.  The results were compared with estimates made by an
   array of nine Bowen Ratio surface stations.  Similarity theory, using
   vertically averaged values, produced estimates that were reasonably
   close to the surface values.  However, the use of values at the top of
   the PBL resulted in large overestimation of the evaporation fluxes. 
   When complete soundings were available, the conservation equation
   yielded estimates which agreed very well with surface values.  The
   agreement was reduced for incomplete soundings.  This is likely related
   to the sensitivity of the equation to uncertainties in the height of the
   inversion.  Overall, the conservation equation produced estimates in
   closest agreement with the surface stations.  The results suggest that
   adequate vertical resolution of measured profiles is important for
   proper estimation of regional surface fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{A new formulation is proposed for the estimation of transmissivity in
   confined aquifers based on head measurements.  This formulation consists
   of a formulation which minimizes a weighted residual norm of the
   gradient of the measured and observed head.  The weighting is the square
   of the estimated transmissivity.  We show by theoretical analysis and
   numerical experimentation the improved global convergence properties and
   characteristics of stability under head measurement uncertainty
   exhibited by the new formulation.  We conclude that the new formulation
   may be superior to conventional head residual formulations or may be
   useful as an added term to conventional formulations.  The formulation
   is further demonstrated by a field scale application to the Friuli
   Aquifer in Italy.}},

Abstract = {{Many geophysical properties can be described as spatial stochastic
   processes, including spatially correlated hydraulic conductivity fields.
   Use of regional data can potentially improve estimation of such
   processes.  We consider the case in which observations at each of
   several sites are described by a general linear model, while the
   parameters of these models arise from a common regional distribution. 
   Parametric empirical Bayes methods enable the determination of the
   parameters of the regional distribution via maximum likelihood. 
   However, such methods have not been utilized for spatial stocbastic
   processes.  We develop the application of a simple iterative technique
   for maximum likelihood estimation of the regional parameters, and
   demonstrate its use with a common parameterization of the spatial
   covariance structure.  Synthetic data tests show the potential for
   substantial reduction in estimation risk through use of such techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The transient hydraulic behavior of highly compressible aquitards is
   investigated through numerical analysis and field studies.  Variations
   in the hydraulic parameters of an aquitard during consolidation are
   accounted for by incorporating empirical relationships derived from
   standard consolidation tests into the one-dimensional flow equation. 
   The resulting equation is highly nonlinear.  The hydraulic response of
   an aquitard with physical properties typical of the compressible clays
   of Mexico City is evaluated with both standard linear analysis and with
   a nonlinear approach where the hydraulic parameters are
   stress-dependent.  The results indicate that decreases in the hydraulic
   diffusivity of the aquitard due to consolidation lead to diminished
   leakage flux, slower groundwater velocities and solute transport rates,
   longer transient response periods and less land subsidence than would be
   predicted by classical linear theory.  Evaluation of field data from a
   site near Mexico City indicates that significant interpretive errors may
   arise if the stress dependence of the hydraulic parameters is ignored in
   these types of systems.}},

Abstract = {{Local approximation of functions based on values and derivatives at the
   nodes of a discretized grid are often used in solving problems
   numerically for which analytical solutions do not exist. In gradient
   dynamic programming (Foufoula-Georgiou and Kitanidis, 1988) the use of
   such functions for the approximation of the cost-to-go function
   alleviates the ``curse of dimensionality{''} by reducing the number of
   discretization nodes per state while obtaining high-accuracy solutions.
   Also, efficient Newton-type schemes can be used for the stage-wise
   optimization, since now the approximation functions have continuous
   first derivatives. Our interest is in the case where the cost-to-go
   function is convex. However, the interpolants may not always be convex,
   introducing numerical problems. In this paper we address the problem of
   interpolating nodal values and derivatives of a one-dimensional convex
   function with a convex interpolant so that potential computational
   difficulties due to approximation-induced nonconvexity are avoided, and
   an efficient convergence to global instead of local optimal controls is
   guaranteed at every single-stage optimization.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical model is formulated to investigate the development of the
   amplitude of alternate bars in unsteady flows.  The problem is tackled
   by means of a weakly nonlinear analysis developed in a neighborhood of
   the threshold conditions for bar formation.  Bar response to unsteady
   flow is found to depend on a parameter U-triple-over-dot that is a
   measure of the ratio between the time scale of the basic flow and the
   time scale of bar growth.  The present theory shows that if
   U-triple-over-dot is O(1), as often occurs in nature, flow unsteadiness
   affects the instantaneous growth rate and phase of bar perturbations and
   controls the final amplitude reached by the bed configuration.  A
   procedure for determining the final amplitude for a given flood event is
   proposed.  Flume experiments were performed to test the main theoretical
   results.  The bed response to unsteady flow was measured for different
   values of the period of the flood.  The observed temporal behavior of
   the bar amplitude proves to be strongly affected by the unsteady
   character of the flow for U-triple-over-dot of O(1), as predicted by the
   theory.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the flow and
   transport properties of a fractured porous tuff block measuring 20 x 20
   x 50 cm.  One porous ceramic plate was placed immediately above a
   fracture and two other plates were placed on either side of the fracture
   above the rock matrix.  The plates control the pressure head applied to
   the upper surface of the fractured rock block.  Laboratory results are
   simulated using the boundary integral method for a single saturated
   fracture with an assumed uniform transmissivity embedded within a porous
   tuff block.  The simulation is used to identify the saturated hydraulic
   properties of the fracture.  Matrix hydraulic conductivity is estimated
   as 50 x 10(-9) m s-1 and the fracture transmissivity is estimated as 5.0
   x 10(-9) m2 s-1.  Much of the flow which exits the fracture at the lower
   surface first passes through the rock matrix even though a direct
   contact with a porous plate is present.  Travel times and breakthrough
   curves are calculated by integrating the inverse velocity along a
   streamline; and then summing over all streamlines.  Observed
   breakthrough curves were used to estimate fracture dispersivities which
   ranged from 0.0207 to 8.01 m.  Breakthrough curves deviated from
   simulation results due to significant channeling of fracture flow.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture flow under conditions of partial fluid saturation is studied
   where a portion of the fracture is filled with water and the remaining
   portion is filled with air.  A discrete air-water interface is used to
   separate the saturated from the drained regions within the fracture.  A
   laboratory flow experiment is presented which demonstrates the interface
   concept.  The steady state air-water interface position is observed by
   maintaining a circular water source at constant positive pressure head
   between two vertical glass plates.  An analytic solution to the flow
   problem is compared to the observed interface position and to simulated
   results which assume that a constant capillary pressure head can be
   assigned along the interface.  Simulations performed for a hypothetical
   vertical fracture indicate zones of positive and negative pressure head
   in the saturated zone as well as an air-filled zone.  For the
   hypothetical fracture examined, fluid travel times are not substantially
   changed as fracture saturation decreases.  This result may not hold
   generally for all fractures.}},

Abstract = {{Surface waters, shallow groundwaters, and precipitation samples were
   collected along three traverses, which begin at the California coast and
   are oriented in an east-west manner, roughly parallel to the atmospheric
   flow path of meteoric water.  The hydrogen isotope compositions from
   short-term precipitation records varied as much as 40 parts-per-thousand
   at one location and were not representative of the average annual
   isotopic composition of precipitation.  The hydrogen isotope ratios of
   surface waters and shallow groundwaters distinguish segments with
   isotopic variations that correlate with measured vertical fluxes of
   meteoric water.  One coastal segment appears to closely approximate an
   open system in which precipitation dominates over evapotranspiration. 
   Most segments are described by rather regular variations in delta-D: 
   3-45 parts-per-thousand per 100 km, which represent different degrees of
   closure of the hydrologic system caused by variable partitioning of
   precipitation between runoff and evapotranspiration.  All partially
   closed systems imply terrestrial recycling of water.  A simple model
   estimates this amount to be about 20\% across northern and central
   California.  Three segments, representing the Great Basin, show
   virtually no geographic variation and appear to represent isotopically
   closed systems.}},

Abstract = {{Extending a data record back in time using historical or paleoflood data
   has the potential to provide a considerable amount of information on
   very large floods.  Parametric estimation methods are readily applicable
   to flood frequency analysis when historical or paleoflood estimates are
   available.  However, all parametric approaches need an assumption about
   the underlying parent distribution, which is never known exactly.  In
   recent years nonparametric methods of estimating probability density
   functions have been developed.  Each of these involves the use of a
   suitable smoothing function known as a kernel.  A new nonparametric
   variable kernel estimation model is proposed.  Results obtained from a
   limited amount of real data and from simulation experiments show that
   quantiles estimated by the nonparametric method are better than those
   estimated by some selected parametric models both in descriptive ability
   and in predictive ability.  The uncertainty in the choice of the
   threshold value of perception of a historical flood is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved compounds in the water phase are rejected during freezing of
   soils.  This phenomenon occurs due to the inability of ice crystals to
   incorporate most alien molecules.  The ice grows only by association
   with water molecules, and molecules of solutes are rejected into the
   unfrozen water.  A mathematical model for salt rejection in freezing
   saline soils has been developed by employing the mass balance equations
   for water and solute in a saturated porous medium, and the conservation
   of energy equation.  Additional relations introduced include a moisture
   retention curve as a function of ice-water capillary pressure, the
   Clapeyron equation and expressions for the heat capacity and the
   effective thermal conductivity of the soil.  The resulting set of seven
   equations in terms of solute concentration, soil temperature, pore
   water, ice, and capillary pressures, and degrees of water and ice
   saturation have been solved simultaneously using a Newton-Raphson
   linearization, with implicit iterative treatment of nonlinearities. 
   Results indicate the development of unfrozen high salt concentration
   regions trapped in a frozen zone at sufficiently high freezing rates. 
   The numerical results are compared with experimental data obtained by
   some researchers.  Favorable match is obtained between the theoretical
   and experimental results.  Finally, extension of the model to situations
   where ice lensing and soil deformations are significant is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The solution of the full nonlinear unsaturated flow equation is given
   for a problem of infiltration (and associated subsurface flows) into a
   planar hillslope of a homogeneous isotropic soil with uniform initial
   moisture content.  The solution uses the assumption that, at some
   distance below the slope crest, a spatial equilibrium is approached with
   the moisture content (and other properties) independent of downslope
   coordinate x{*} and dependent only on the normal coordinate z{*} and
   time t.  The analysis is found to be generally applicable beyond a small
   distance from the slope crest (or from a point of slope change).  For
   slope angles less than 30-degrees, infiltration normal to the slope
   differs relatively little from infiltration from a horizontal surface. 
   Interesting aspects of the solution include a time-independent total
   horizontal flow into the slope and a time-dependent downslope total flow
   component which behaves as t1/2 at small t and as t at large t. 
   Previously, hillslope flows in these directions have been discussed in
   terms of soil anisotropy and layering, but these flows in a homogeneous
   isotropic soil are simple physical consequences of capillarity and
   gravity.  The analysis applies with minor modification to two simple
   types of hillslope anisotropy:  (1) anisotropy parallel to the slope and
   (2) horizontal anisotropy.  Type 1 yields a complicated time dependence
   of the horizontal flow, and type 2 affects downslope flow similarly. 
   These flow directions will commonly reverse during the course of the
   infiltration process.}},

Abstract = {{A Monte Carlo study of a physically based distributed-parameter
   hydrologic model is described.  The catchment model simulates overland
   flow and streamflow, and it is based on the kinematic wave concept. 
   Soil Conservation Service curves are used to model rainfall excess
   within the basin.  The model was applied to the Ralston Creek watershed,
   a small (7.5 km2) rural catchment in eastern Iowa.  Sensitivity of the
   model response with respect to rainfall-input spatial and temporal
   sampling density was investigated.  The input data were generated by a
   space-time stochastic model of rainfall.  The generated rainfall fields
   were sampled by the varied-density synthetic rain gauge networks.  The
   basin response, based on 5-min' increment input data from a network of
   high density with about 1 gauge per 0.1 km2, was assumed to be the
   ``ground truth,{''} and other results were compared against it. 
   Included in the study was also a simple lumped parameter model based on
   the unit hydrograph concept.  Results were interpreted in terms of
   hydrograph characteristics such as peak magnitude, time-to-peak, and
   total runoff volume.  The results indicate higher sensitivity of basin
   response with respect to the temporal resolution than to the spatial
   resolution of the rainfall data.  Also, the frequency analysis of the
   flood peaks shows severe underestimation by the lumped model.  This may
   have implications for the design of hydraulic structures.}},
