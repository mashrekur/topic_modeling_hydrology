Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out to determine the breakthrough of bacteria
   through a saturated aquifer sand at three flow velocities and three cell
   concentrations. Bacteria were either suspended in deionized water or
   0.01 mol L(-1) NaCl solution. Bacterial transport was found to increase
   with flow velocity and cell concentration but was significantly retarded
   in the presence of 0.01 mol L(-1) NaCl. A mathematical model based on
   the advection-dispersion equation was formulated to describe bacterial
   transport and retention in porous media. The transport equations for
   bacteria were solved using the finite difference Crank-Nicolson scheme
   combined with Newton-Raphson iterations. The best fit of the numerical
   model to the experimental data was obtained using the downhill simplex
   optimization technique to minimize the sum of the squares of deviations
   between model predictions and experimental data by varying three
   parameters. This numerical model was found to describe the experimental
   data very well under all the experimental conditions tested. An
   alternative model (also based on the advection-dispersion equation) was
   tested against all the experimental data sets, but it did not represent
   the experimental data as well as the model proposed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate that for losing reaches with significant diurnal
   variations in stream temperature, the effect of stream temperature on
   streambed seepage is a major factor contributing to reduced afternoon
   streamflows. An explanation is based on the effect of stream temperature
   on the hydraulic conductivity of the streambed, which can be expected to
   double in the 0 degrees to 25 degrees C temperature range. Results are
   presented for field experiments in which stream discharge and
   temperature were continuously measured for several days over losing
   reaches at St. Kevin Gulch Colorado, and Tijeras Arroyo, New Mexico. At
   St. Kevin Gulch in July 1991, the diurnal stream temperature in the
   160-m study reach ranged from about 4 degrees to 18 degrees C,
   discharges ranged from 10 to 18 L/s, and streamflow loss in the study
   reach ranged from 2.7 to 3.7 L/s. On the basis of measured stream
   temperature variations, the predicted change in conductivity was about
   38\%; the measured change in stream loss was about 26\%, suggesting that
   streambed temperature varied less than the stream temperature. At
   Tijeras Arroyo in May 1992, diurnal stream temperature in the 655-m
   study reach ranged from about 10 degrees to 25 degrees C and discharge
   ranged from 25 to 55 L/s. Streamflow loss was converted to infiltration
   rates by factoring in the changing stream reach surface area and
   streamflow losses due to evaporation rates as measured in a
   hemispherical evaporation chamber. Infiltration rates ranged from about
   0.7 to 2.0 m/d, depending on time and location. Based on measured stream
   temperature variations, the predicted change in conductivity was 29\%;
   the measured change in infiltration was also about 27\%. This suggests
   that high infiltration rates cause rapid convection of heat to the
   streambed. Evapotranspiration losses were estimated for the reach and
   adjacent flood plain within the arroyo. On the basis of these estimates,
   only about 5\% of flow loss was consumed via stream evaporation and
   stream-side evapotranspiration, indicating that 95\% of the loss within
   the study reach represented groundwater recharge.}},

Abstract = {{An equation describing the mean daily discharge of groundwater by
   transpiration from phreatophyte shrubs as a function of plant density,
   leaf area index, and depth to groundwater was developed using an energy
   combination model calibrated with energy fluxes calculated from
   micrometeorological data. The energy combination model partitions the
   energy budget between the soil and canopy permitting plant transpiration
   to be separated from evaporation from the soil. The shrubs include
   greasewood, rabbitbrush, shadscale, and sagebrush. Converting a daily
   groundwater discharge rate calculated by the equation to an annual rate
   requires an estimate of the number of days the plants used only
   groundwater. Rates used during previous studies in the Great Basin range
   from 0.030 to 0.152 m yr(-1) rates calculated with the equation
   developed during this study range from 0.024 to 0.308 m yr(-1) for the
   reported field conditions. Annual rates estimated in this study differ
   from the estimated annual rates used in previous studies by factors
   ranging from 0.8 to 5.0.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental observations of capillary rise and hysteresis of water or
   ethanol in glass beads are presented to improve our understanding of
   those physical processes in porous media. The results provide evidence
   that capillary rise into porous media cannot be fully explained by a
   model of cylinders. They further demonstrate that the `'ink bottle''
   model does not provide an adequate explanation of hysteresis. Glass
   beads serving as a model for ideal soil are enclosed in a rectangular
   glass chamber model. A TV camera associated with a microscope was used
   to record the processes of capillary rise and drainage. It is clearly
   shown during capillary rise that the fluid exhibits a `'jump'' behavior
   at the neck of the pores in an initially dry profile or at the bottom of
   the water film in an initially wet profile. Under an initially dry
   condition, the jump initiates at the particle with smallest diameter.
   The jump process continues to higher elevations until at equilibrium the
   surface tensile force is balanced by the hydrostatic force. The wetting
   front at that time is readily observed as flat and saturated. Under an
   initially wet condition, capillary rise occurs as a water film
   thickening process associated with the jump process. Trapped air behind
   the wetting front renders the wetting front irregular and unsaturated.
   The capillary rise into an initially wet porous medium can be higher
   than that into an initially dry profile. During the drying process,
   large surface areas associated with the gas-liquid interface develop,
   allowing the porous medium to retain more water than during the wetting
   process at the same pressure. That mechanism explains better the
   hysteresis phenomenon in porous media in contrast to other mechanisms
   that now prevail.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents experimental observations of infiltration and finger
   flow in glass beads. In paper 1 (Lu et al., this issue), we showed that
   the total surface tensile force is much greater in initially wet
   profiles than in initially dry profiles. During capillary rise in glass
   beads, the `'jump'' process takes place for an initially dry condition,
   whereas in an initially wet profile not only a jump process but a film
   thickening associated with film flow characterizes capillary rise. In
   this paper, infiltration experiments into initially dry glass beads show
   that the wetting front is relatively saturated and flat compared with
   the unsaturated and irregular wetting front into an initially wet
   profile. In the experiments of finger flow, photographs show that the
   tip of the finger is completely water saturated and that no partially
   saturated zones exist around the saturated tip. The fingers initiated in
   a dry zone disappear when they reach an initially wet lower zone even
   when the packing conditions of the glass beads are identical. Hence the
   criterion for instability when water is applied at a rate less than the
   value of the saturated hydraulic conductivity does not apply to an
   initially wet condition. When a fine layer of glass beads lies on a
   coarse layer that is initially dry, fingering will take place during
   infiltration and flow is unstable. If the coarse lower layer is
   initially wet, finger flow does not develop, and the flow remains
   stable. More investigations are required to ascertain threshold values
   of the initial water content causing instability of water movement in
   porous media.}},

Abstract = {{A kinetic transport model with the ability to account for variations in
   cell density of the aqueous and solid phases was developed for bacteria
   in porous media. Sorption kinetics in the advective-dispersive-sorptive
   equation was described by assuming that adsorption was proportional to
   the aqueous cell density and the number of available sites on the solid
   phase, whereas desorption was proportional to the density of sorbed
   cells. A numerical solution to the model was tested against laboratory
   column data, and the performance was compared with that of a two-site
   model. The kinetic model described the column data as well as the
   two-site model did, but the highest efficiencies of both models were
   associated with experiments with the smallest sorption. Furthermore, the
   kinetic model accounted for cell density dependent sorption, as
   demonstrated by fair predictions of bacterial transport at one cell
   density when using parameters obtained at another cell density.}},

Abstract = {{Petroleum products, such as gasoline, leaked from an underground storage
   tank can be recovered successfully by two-pump operations. The success
   of the recovery effort depends on the accurate placement of the recovery
   well at the spill site. An effective recovery operation can minimize the
   remaining contamination mass in the subsurface. Therefore, a careful
   evaluation and determination has to be made as to where to locate the
   recovery well. The location of the well can be decided based on an
   estimation of the extent and thickness of free product on the water
   table. Such an estimation should be based on analysis of governing
   mechanisms. In this study we present analytical solutions to estimate
   the recovery of oil from an established oil lens. These solutions are
   obtained by applying the Laplace transformation to averaged linear
   partial differential equations governing the phenomenon. The governing
   equation for the free product thickness is derived by averaging the oil
   phase mass balance equation along the free product thickness and
   substituting the boundary conditions at the oil/water interface and oil
   surface. The analytical solutions estimate the temporal and spatial
   distribution of free product thickness on the water table for a number
   of recovery scenarios. Results are presented for the temporal and
   spatial variation of the free product thickness, temporal variation of
   the free product Volume recovered, and recovery efficiency based on the
   readings at the monitoring wells. Since they can be utilized without a
   great deal of data, analytical solutions are quite attractive as
   screening tools in two-pump free product recovery operations.}},

Abstract = {{A framework for numerically modeling the biodegradation of petroleum
   hydrocarbons within a flooded column of porous media in which a residual
   saturation of petroleum is present is developed. The petroleum product
   of interest is considered to be representable, at a desired level of
   detail, as a mixture of a finite number of classes of hydrocarbon
   components. Of these classes, all but one are assumed to be
   biodegradable by indigenous microorganisms. A specific microbial
   population is associated with each degradable class. Microbes growing at
   the oil-water interface take up the hydrocarbon components of the
   petroleum through the use of extracellular pseudosolubilization factors,
   which facilitate transport from the oil-water interface into the cells.
   Minimum Monod kinetics is used to model many of the biological
   processes. The transport of dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus
   through the column provides the microorganisms with the required
   electron acceptor and nutrients for aerobic metabolism.}},

Abstract = {{Flow takes place in a heterogeneous formation of spatially variable
   conductivity, which is modeled as a Stationary space random function; To
   model the variability at the regional scale, the formation is viewed as
   one of a two-dimensional, horizontal structure. A constant head gradient
   is applied on the formation boundary such that the flow is uniform in
   the mean. A plume of inert solute is injected at t = 0 ina volume V-0.
   Under ergodic conditions the plume centroid moves with the constant,
   mean flow velocity U, and a longitudinal macrodispersion coefficient
   d(L) may be defined as half of the time rate of change of the plume
   second spatial moment with respect to the centroid. For a
   log-conductivity covariance C-Y of finite integral scale I, at first
   order in the variance sigma(Y)(2) and for a travel distance L = Ut much
   greater than I, D-L --> sigma(Y)(2)UI and transport is coined as
   Fickian. Ergodicity of the moments is ensured if l much greater than I,
   where l is the initial plume scale. Some field observations have
   suggested that heterogeneity may be of evolving scales and that the
   macrodispersion coefficient may grow with L without reaching a constant
   limit (anomalous diffusion). To model such a behavior, previous studies
   have assumed that C, is stationary but of unbounded integral scale with
   C-Y similar to ar(beta) (-1 < beta < 0) for large lag r. Under ergodic
   conditions, it was found that asymptotically d(L) similar to
   aUL(1+beta), i.e.,, non-Fickian; behavior and anomalous dispersion. The
   present study claims that an ergodic behavior is not possible for a
   given finite plume of initial size l, since the basic requirement that l
   much greater than I, cannot be satisfied for C-Y of unbounded scale. For
   instance, the centroid does not move any more with U but is random
   (Figure 1), owing to the large-scale heterogeneity. In such a situation
   the actual effective dispersion coefficient D-L is defined as half the
   rate of change of the mean second spatial moment with respect to the
   plume centroid in each realization. This is the accessible entity in a
   given experiment, We show that in contrast with d(L), the behavior of
   D-L is controlled by 1 and it has the Fickian limit D-L similar to
   aUI(1+beta) (Figure 3). We also discuss the case in which Y is of
   stationary increments and is characterized by its variogram gamma(Y).
   Then U and d(L) Can be defined only if gamma(Y) is truncated
   (equivalently, an `'infrared cutoff' is carried out in the spectrum of
   Y). However, for a bounded U it is shown that D-L depends only on
   gamma(Y). Furthermore, for gamma(Y) = ar(beta), D-L similar to
   aUl(2)L(beta-1); i.e., dispersion is Fickian for 0 < beta < 1, whereas
   for 1 < beta < 2, transport is non-Fickian. Since beta < 2, D-L cannot
   grow faster than L = Ut. This is in contrast with a recently proposed
   model (Neuman, 1990) in which the dispersion coefficient is independent
   of the plume size and it grows approximately like L(1.5).}},

Abstract = {{Macrodispersion in discrete colonnade network models is investigated
   using a series of Monte Carlo type numerical experiments. The numerical
   simulations consider fluid flow and advective transport through a square
   flow region of a two-dimensional network of hexagonal colonnades.
   Macrodispersivities are calculated as a function of the scale and
   orientation of the square flow region within the larger, parent
   geometry. Particle tracking, with flux-weighted tracer injection and
   monitoring, is used to generate experimental residence time
   distributions (RTDs). The method of moments is used to characterize the
   longitudinal tracer spreading. The simulated RTDs are utilized to
   examine the macrodispersive behavior in colonnade networks (column
   diameter, 1 m) with lognormally distributed fracture apertures (b, in
   millimeters). The network models are assumed to consist of open
   fractures with mu(ln b) = -1.945 and sigma(ln b) = 0.896; this
   translates to an equivalent continuum log-conductivity variance
   (sigma(ln K)(2)) of 3.67. Based on an ensemble average of 100
   realizations, the slope for spatial variance versus scale of observation
   ranges from 3.15 to 3.36 m for varying orientations of the hydraulic
   gradient. For ensemble-averaged data, the varying orientations appear to
   have little effect on the macrodispersive behavior. For
   single-realization experiments, the computed macrodispersivities are
   directionally dependent at a length scale as large as 30 times the
   column diameter (and probably much beyond). The computed asymptotic and
   preasymptotic macrodispersivities are compared with available stochastic
   solutions for two-dimensional isotropic heterogeneity in the horizontal
   plane. The ensemble-based numerical data are in excellent agreement with
   the solutions of Dagan (1984, 1988) and Gelhar and Axness (1983).
   However, for individual realizations, nonergodic behavior is clearly
   apparent in the near-source, evolving region of transport, and the
   numerical data are quite variable between realizations. The study
   provides important insight on applicability of stochastic continuum
   theories to discrete colonnade network models having sigma(ln K)(2) much
   greater than 1.}},

Abstract = {{Picard iteration is a widely used procedure for solving the nonlinear
   equation governing flow in variably saturated porous media. The method
   is simple to code and computationally cheap, but has been known to fail
   or converge slowly. The Newton method is more complex and expensive (on
   a per-iteration basis) than Picard, and as such has not received very
   much attention. Its robustness and higher rate of convergence, however,
   make it an attractive alternative to the Picard method, particularly for
   strongly nonlinear problems. In this paper the Picard and Newton schemes
   are implemented and compared in one-, two-, and three-dimensional finite
   element simulations involving both steady state and transient flow. The
   eight test cases presented highlight different aspects of the
   performance of the two iterative methods and the different factors that
   can affect their convergence and efficiency, including problem size,
   spatial and temporal discretization, initial solution estimates,
   convergence error norm, mass lumping, time weighting, conductivity and
   moisture content characteristics, boundary;conditions, seepage fades,
   and the extent of fully saturated zones in the soil. Previous strategies
   for enhancing the performance of the Picard and Newton schemes are
   revisited, and new ones are suggested. The strategies include chord
   slope approximations for the derivatives of the characteristic
   equations, relaxing convergence requirements along seepage faces,
   dynamic time step control, nonlinear relaxation, and a mixed
   Picard-Newton approach. The tests show that the Picard or relaxed Picard
   schemes are often adequate for solving Richards' equation, but that in
   cases where these fail to converge or converge slowly, the Newton method
   should be used. The mixed Picard-Newton approach can effectively
   overcome the Newton scheme's sensitivity to initial solution estimates,
   while comparatively poor performance is reported for the various chord
   slope approximations. Finally,given the reliability and efficiency of
   current conjugate gradient-like methods for solving linear nonsymmetric
   systems; the only real drawback of using Newton rather than Picard
   iteration is the algebraic complexity and computational cost of
   assembling the derivative terms of the Jacobian matrix, and it is
   suggested that both methods can be effectively implemented and used in
   numerical models of Richards' equation.}},

Abstract = {{Transient analytical solutions for temperature and pore pressure changes
   near a circular borehole under instantaneous temperature and fluid
   pressure changes inside the borehole are presented. The solutions couple
   conductive heat transfer with Darcy fluid flow, and a borehole under a
   nonhydrostatic far-field stress state is simulated. The heat conduction
   equation is decoupled from the coupled system of isothermal governing
   equations, and the complete solution is obtained by superimposing this
   decoupled solution on the isothermal one. The solution is therefore
   applicable to low-permeability media, where heat transfer is dominated
   by conduction only. Both cold and warm injection processes are studied,
   and the applications to hydraulic fracture initiation and thermally
   induced fluid flow are discussed. Taking Westerly granite as an example,
   it is concluded that the maximum thermally induced pore pressure inside
   the rock formation can be 30\% higher than the isothermal pore pressure,
   with a borehole temperature and fluid pressure change ratio (Delta
   T/Delta p) = 1 degrees C/MPa. It is emphasized that the thermally
   induced pore pressure change can be significant inside a
   low-permeability porous medium, and a coupled solution must be obtained
   to address the mechanical, hydraulic, and thermal responses

Abstract = {{The properties of nonuniform average potential flows in media of
   stationary random conductivity are studied. The mathematical model of
   average flow is derived as a system of governing equations to be
   satisfied by mean velocity and mean head. The averaged Darcy's law
   determines the effective conductivity as an integral operator of the
   convolution type, relating the mean velocity to the mean head gradient
   in a nonlocal way. In Fourier domain the mean velocity is proportional
   to the mean head gradient. The coefficient of proportionality is
   referred to as the effective conductivity tenser and is derived by
   perturbation methods in terms of functionals of the conductivity spatial
   moments. It is shown that the effective conductivity cannot be defined
   uniquely for potential flows. However, this nonuniqueness does not
   affect the spatial distribution of the mean head and velocity.
   Analytical expressions of the effective conductivity tenser are derived
   for two- and three-dimensional flows and for exponential and Gaussian
   correlations of isotropic conductivity. The fundamental solution of the
   governing equations in effective media (mean Green function) is
   calculated for the same cases. Two new asymptotic models of the averaged
   Darcy's law are developed to be applicable to large and small scales of
   heterogeneity. Several asymptotic expansions of the two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional mean Green functions are derived for exponential and
   Gaussian correlations.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic model is developed for the synthesis of daily precipitation

   transition probabilities between weather types. The model reproduces key
   aspects of the historic rainfall regime at daily, monthly, and annual

   of disaggregating general circulation model predictions into finer

Abstract = {{We study the spatial random field of peak flows indexed by a channel
   network. Invariance of the probability distributions of peak flows under
   translation on this indexing set defines statistical homogeneity in a
   network. It implies that hoods can be indexed by the network magnitude,
   or equivalently the drainage area, which serves as a scale parameter.
   This definition generalizes to homogeneity of flows in a geographical
   region containing several networks which are not necessarily the
   subnetworks of a single network. The widely used quantile regression
   method of the United States Geological Survey(USGS) provides one simple
   criterion to approximately designate homogeneous geographic regions. It
   is argued that the redefinition of homogeneity via the constancy of the
   coefficient of variation (CV) of floods implied by the index flood
   assumption is ad hoc. Invariance of the probability distributions of
   peak flows under scale change is used to develop the simple scaling and
   the multiscaling theories of regional hoods in terms of their quantiles.
   The simple scaling theory predicts a constant CV and log-log linearity
   between flood quantiles and drainage areas such that the slopes in these
   equations do not change with the probability of exceedance. Multiscaling
   theory of floods is developed to exhibit differences in floods between
   small and large basins. This theory shows that the CV for small basins
   increases, and for large basins it decreases, as area increases;
   Moreover, the quantiles do not obey log-log linearity with-respect to
   drainage areas. However, for large basins an approximate log-log
   linearity between quantiles and drainage areas is shown to hold. The
   slopes in these equations decrease as p decreases; i.e., larger floods
   have smaller slopes than smaller floods. This approximation provides a
   theoretical interpretation of the results of the empirical quantile
   regression method in homogeneous regions where simple scaling or the
   index flood assumption does not hold. Recent results on physical
   interpretations of the scaling theories are also summarized here. A
   simple nonlinear method is developed to estimate the parameters in the
   multiscaling theory. This method and other features of the theory are
   illustrated using flood data from central Appalachia in the United
   States.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical approach based on the modified Bartlett-Lewis rectangular
   pulses model is presented to disaggregate rainfall statistics from daily
   data. Six model parameters are estimated from 24- and 48-hour
   accumulated rainfall data. Based on these estimated parameters, in
   addition to reproducing 24- and 48-hour statistics, the model is shown
   to infer 1-, 2-, 6-, and 12-hour historical statistics satisfactorily.
   An upper limit for disaggregation scale (about 2 days) for this model
   has been identified. This characteristic behavior of the model is
   related to the power law dependence of the power spectrum for timescales
   smaller than 2 days. A detailed comparison between observed and modeled
   statistics of rainfall data is presented for two rain gages, one from
   central Italy and the other from the midwestern United States.}},

Abstract = {{A semiempirical approach for downscaling general circulation model (GCM)
   based daily atmospheric circulation patterns (CP) and predicting local
   climatological variables under climate change is developed.
   Specifically, the daily 500-hPa surface outputs of the Canadian Climate
   Center (CCC) and Max Planck Institute (MPI) (Germany) GCMs are linked
   stochastically, using a split sampling approach, to local temperature
   and precipitation in Nebraska. Three series of data are analyzed:
   historical data, 1 x CO2 GCM results and 2 x CO2 GCM results. Between
   these three data sets, no significant difference can be detected in
   either CP typology (constructed by principal component analysis and k
   means method) or stochastic properties of daily time series (Markov
   matrix). On the other hand, the average geopotential height of the
   500-hPa pressure field exhibits significant change, labeled the Delta
   CO2 effect, between the 1 x CO2 and 2 x CO2 cases. Accordingly, climate
   change is assumed to be represented by the historical average
   geopotential height augmented by the Delta CO2 increment. It is found
   that both the CCC and MPI GCMs lead to predicting a winter temperature
   increase of 3 degrees-6 degrees C, a smaller but significant increase in
   spring and fall temperatures, and no increase in summer. The probability
   of precipitation occurrence is found to remain almost unchanged, as well
   as the dry period duration. The estimates of local response to climate
   change depend upon the location and the GCM used for downscaling the CP.
   The MPI GCM, which includes an ocean-atmosphere coupling, appears to
   yield smaller downscaled changes than the purely atmosphere-based CCC
   GCM.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term (hours) experimental acidification of a Cd-contaminated
   Precambrian Shield stream with low buffering capacity caused the release

   consistent with pH-dependent desorption and dissolution of amorphous
   hydroxides. Partial neutralization of the stream with MgCO3 inhibited
   metal release for most metals; however, excess Mg appeared to stimulate
   Cd release. Thus addition of Mg (and probably Ca) compounds to
   neutralize acidified water may be ineffective for reducing Cd
   concentrations in solution because added base cations apparently compete

Abstract = {{The development of reactive barrier systems to remove metals from
   groundwater requires an improved understanding of the behavior of
   reaction fronts and the coupling between fluid flow, solute transport,
   reaction, and hydraulic changes. We report the results of experiments in
   which a dilute Fe(ClO4)(3) solution was pumped through columns packed
   with mixtures of quartz sand and crushed calcite. The deposition of
   ferric oxyhydroxide peaked at, but was not restricted to, the visible
   precipitate front, where the neutralization of acidity generated by
   hydrolysis was completed. Even beyond this reaction front, calcite
   dissolution and ferric oxyhydroxide precipitation continued gradually.
   Upgradient from the front, where all calcite had been removed from the
   porous medium, ferric oxyhydroxide precipitation continued because of
   nucleation around older precipitate at a pH less than the influent pH.
   The velocity of the reaction front varied with the ratio of the initial
   volume of calcite to the pore water velocity, whereas the width of the
   zone of pronounced calcite dissolution varied as a function of the
   Damkohler number. These experiments illustrate how a model barrier can
   effectively and rapidly remove ferric iron from solution without fouling
   of the reactive surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In situ measurements of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution
   are cumbersome, especially under frozen conditions, and often involve
   destruction of the soil volume sampled. The objective of this work was
   to use time domain reflectometry (TDR) to study the dynamics of ions in
   the soil solution caused by freezing and thawing. The data set consisted
   of field,measured TDR and temperature records in four soil profiles in a
   loamy soil. Bulk electrical conductivity and electrical conductivity
   were evaluated from the TDR traces. Freezing caused a temporary twofold
   to fourfold increase in electrical conductivity. Strong evidence of a
   downward transport of ions during freezing was found; The transport was
   attributed to thermally induced regelation. Infiltration resulted in an
   increased electrical conductivity. TDR was shown to be a promising
   technique for monitoring the electrical conductivity of the soil
   solution, in both frozen and unfrozen soils.}},

   between water influx, evaporation, and condensation as modified by
   salinity-caused vapor pressure lowering. The model is used to examine
   the influence of thermal loading on waste package environment. Increased
   thermal gradients near the waste packages are shown to be as important
   as overall temperature in drying the waste package. The waste package
   environment is predicted to be highly variable, ranging from a
   concentrated brine to more dilute solutions. Under certain sets of

Abstract = {{As a follow-up to a previous paper (Ma and Selim, 1994a), this study was
   designed to further validate a modified second-order, two-site (SOTS)
   model for describing atrazine transport in column miscible experiments.
   Moreover, the capability of the SOTS model was compared with that of the
   multireaction transport model (MRTM) of Selim (1989). For both models
   the necessary parameters were derived from batch experiments and tritium
   tracer breakthrough results. The models were used solely to predict
   atrazine breakthrough curves (BTCs) for different experimental
   conditions. We also proposed an alternative way of analyzing tritium
   BTCs, where the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient D and an effective
   solute transport length L(e) were used as fitting parameters. Tritium
   fitted D and L(e) were used in both models to arrive at atrazine BTC
   predictions. The SOTS model provided superior predictions over MRTM for
   all (14) atrazine BTCs regardless of (1) input concentration C-0, (2)
   soil column length L, (3) pore water velocity v, (4) multiple pulse
   applications, and (5) flow interruption (incubation). We conclude that
   the SOTS model was capable of describing chemical heterogeneity of
   atrazine retention and transport. BTC predictions lend credence to the
   transport parameter L(e) in predicting solute transport in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Given the high cost of data collection at groundwater contamination
   remediation sites, it is becoming increasingly important to make data
   collection as cost-effective as possible. A Bayesian data worth
   framework is developed in an attempt to carry out this task for
   remediation programs in which a groundwater contaminant plume must be
   located and then hydraulically contained. The framework is applied to a
   hypothetical contamination problem where uncertainty in plume location
   and extent are caused by uncertainty in source location, source loading
   time, and aquifer heterogeneity. The goal is to find the optimum number
   and the best locations for a sequence of observation wells that minimize
   the expected cost of remediation plus sampling. Simplifying assumptions
   include steady state heads, advective transport, simple retardation, and
   remediation costs as a linear function of discharge rate. In the case
   here, an average of six observation wells was needed. Results indicate
   that this optimum number was particularly sensitive to the mean
   hydraulic conductivity. The optimum number was also sensitive to the
   variance of the hydraulic conductivity, annual discount rate, operating
   cost, and sample unit cost. It was relatively insensitive to the
   correlation length of hydraulic conductivity. For the case here, points
   of greatest uncertainty in plume presence were on average poor
   candidates for sample locations, and randomly located samples were not
   cost-effective.}},

Abstract = {{Simulated rainfall was applied to runoff plots of four sizes at three
   sites to generate overland flow. The hydraulic resistance to the flow
   was assessed using the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor which was
   calculated both from direct measurement of discharge and depth of flow
   and by fitting model hydrographs based on the kinematic wave equations
   to the rising limbs of the runoff hydrographs. Results show that there
   is no consistent variation in the friction factor as a function either
   of plot size or of the method used in its calculation. However, the
   direct measurement of depth and discharge appears to give more reliable
   results. Values for the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor observed here are
   an order of magnitude greater than those obtained by Abrahams et al.
   (1994) in experiments on nearby plots but where runoff was generated by
   flow onto the upper end of the plots from a trickle pipe. It is
   concluded that determination of friction factors to be used in modeling
   runoff and soil erosion must be made by direct measurement of flow
   hydraulics of rain-induced overland flow rather than from the runoff
   hydrograph or by using trickle-induced flow.}},

Abstract = {{Stress relief fracturing provides the large mechanical apertures needed
   for the development of conduit porosity in carbonate aquifers.
   Examination of valleys incised into Mississippian age limestones
   throughout the Appalachian plateaus has demonstrated a;consistent
   pattern taken in the development of conduits in these settings. Master
   conduits (caves) are found beneath the valley walls in general, not
   directly beneath the actual surface channel. Common features of the
   studied `'Cumberland style'' caves are valley-parallel master conduit
   segments, exceptional concordance of conduit orientation with minor
   surface topographic variations, development on distinct `'levels,'' and
   development in a downdip position from master surface streams. The
   recognition that these conduits form along geologically young fracture
   systems of increased aperture is a departure-from previous theories of
   cave origin. Prior theories have either explicitly or implicitly assumed
   that caves develop along joints and fractures of significant geologic
   age, related more to regional tectonic forces than to present-day
   topographic influences.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years a new theory of the evolution of drainage networks and
   associated landscapes has emerged, mainly in connection with the
   development of fractal geometry and of self-organized criticality (SOC)
   concepts. This theory has much improved our understanding of the
   mechanisms which determine the structure of natural landscapes and their
   dynamics of evolution. In the first part of this paper the main ideas in
   the theory of landscape self-organization are outlined, and some
   remarkable features of the resulting structures are presented. In the
   second part we apply theoretical tools developed in the context of
   multifractal fields to the study of the scaling properties of the field
   of elevations of SOC landscapes. We observe that such landscapes appear
   to be more complex than simple self-affine fractals, although in some
   cases a simple fractal framework may be adequate for their description.
   We also show that multiple scaling may emerge as a result of
   heterogeneity in the field properties reflecting climate and geology.}},

Abstract = {{Data for several river networks show algebraically decaying distribution
   functions for the mean annual discharge and the dissipation rate
   (Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1992). We derived relation between the
   exponent alpha in the integrated mean annual discharge distribution P(Q
   greater than or equal to q) similar to q(-alpha) and the topological
   dimension D-t of the network, alpha = 1 - 1/D-t. Using the
   experimentally determined value D-t approximate to 1.8 (Tarboton et al.,
   1988) we find alpha approximate to 0.45, in good agreement with the data
   of (Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 1992). For the random model (Shreve, 1967,
   1969; Smart and Werner, 1974) we find an exponent of 1/2.}},

Abstract = {{We examine solutions of the convection-diffusion equation during steady
   radial flow in two and three dimensions with diffusivity proportional to
   P-n, with P the Peclet number. In two dimensions, closed-form solutions
   of the Laplace-transformed equation occur only for n = 1 and n = 2; and
   in three dimensions only for n = 5/4 and n = 2. The inversions for n = 1
   (two dimensions) and 5/4 (three dimensions) cannot be expressed in
   closed form. On the other hand, the value n = 2, proposed by de Gennes
   (1983), leads to simple exact solutions, both in two dimensions and in
   three. In both cases a change of variable gives a one-dimensional
   equation with constant coefficients. Exact instantaneous and continuous
   point source solutions for radial flow in two and three dimensions are
   thus established. In general, finite difference methods are needed for
   arbitrary n. Relevant instantaneous and continuous point source
   diffusion solutions are developed for radial two- and three-dimensional
   systems. These represent small-time solutions useful for initiating the
   finite difference solutions for convection-diffusion with arbitrary n.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents strategies for vectorizing finite element codes in
   simulating large groundwater flow and transport problems. The approaches
   take advantage of vector-processing capabilities of the Cray Y-MP by
   regulating the node-element and node-node relationships. Regularization
   is achieved by adding auxiliary nodes and elements around the simulation
   domain. Vectorization of the global matrix assembly is due solely to the
   regularity of incidence matrix definition, while the vectorization of
   the iterative solver takes advantage of the regularity of the node-node
   relationship and the concepts of wavefronts. The vectorization schemes
   are illustrated using the code VapourT. Rectangular elements are also
   added to the VapourT in addition to its original triangular elements.
   Test runs of the vectorized code with the vector processor turned on
   (VT4) versus the original code with the vector processor turned off
   (VT1) for triangular elements indicate overall speedups of 6-10.93 times
   in terms of CPU seconds. Part of the speedup results from the ability to
   eliminate some addressing subroutines. However, most of the speedup is
   due to the vectorization scheme. The speedups purely due to
   vectorization for the vectorized code (from VT3 to VT4) are 3.51-5.81
   times in terms of CPU seconds for triangular elements and 4.28-7.25
   (from VT5 to VT6) for rectangular elements.}},

Abstract = {{Two independent techniques, X ray absorption and light transmission, are
   developed and demonstrated for imaging transient saturation fields in
   thin-slab porous systems.  The techniques yield full two-dimensional
   saturation fields with high spatial and temporal resolution.  In the
   time required to make a single measurement by one of the traditional
   methods (e.g., gravimetric or gamma densitometry) an entire image
   consisting of hundreds of thousands of points is acquired by either the
   X ray or light technique.  These methods are also very sensitive,
   capable of resolving a hundred or more levels of saturation at each of
   these points.  Evaluation of these techniques is accomplished by direct
   comparison of X ray and light data as well as comparison with
   gravimetric and gamma densitometry data.  Results of the comparison show
   very close agreement between the four techniques (on average within 5\%
   saturation).  These techniques represent useful tools for investigating
   processes governing unsaturated flow and transport through porous media.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an analysis of the rate of dilution of a
   conservative nonreactive tracer in two well-known field experiments: 
   The Borden (Ontario, Canada) experiment and the Cape Cod (Massachusetts)
   experiment.  In evaluating the dilution of injected sodium bromide, in
   addition to computing the second spatial moments, we have used the
   dilution index and the reactor ratio.  The dilution index is a measure
   of the formation volume occupied by the solute plume, and the reactor
   ratio is a shape factor, which measures how stretched and deformed the
   plume is.  Unlike the second moments, which may go up or down during an
   experiment, the dilution index should increase monotonically.  The
   results for both plumes were quite similar.  After an initial period the
   dilution index increased linearly with time, which is macroscopically
   equivalent to transport in two-dimensional uniform flow.  The reactor
   ratio was relatively constant during the period of the experiments. 
   Their values, about 0.72 for the Borden test and 0.63 for the Cape Cod
   test, indicate that the Cape Cod plume was more stretched and deformed
   than the Borden plume.  The maximum concentration, which is an
   alternative to the dilution index for quantifying dilution, was found to
   be more erratic and more susceptible to sampling error.}},

Abstract = {{The two-region model was developed originally to describe nonsorbing
   chemical transport in soils with dead-end pores based on the concept of
   mobile and immobile regions in the soil.  It has been shown that the
   model can simulate solute transport in soils with local stratification,
   or inhomogeneity, of hydraulic conductivity.  However, the physical
   basis of the model becomes questionable, since the mobile-immobile
   region concept does not apply in stratified soils.  In both soil types
   the nonequilibrium effect is caused by an apparent mass transfer process
   within the soil, as distinct from advection and diffusion.  Where there
   are immobile regions, the mass transfer is due to solute interregion
   diffusion alone.  In stratified soils the nonequilibrium mass transfer
   process is affected also by local flow variations.  A conceptual model,
   numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments are presented to
   analyze these effects.  For a given soil with fixed local stratification
   of hydraulic conductivity, it is shown that in the low-velocity range,
   the apparent mass transfer rate parameter, alpha, scales as V2/D (V is
   pore water velocity in the two-region model and D is the longitudinal
   dispersion coefficient), which implies that the mass transfer process is
   predominantly affected by local flow variations.  When the velocity is
   relatively high, alpha is-proportional-to D(T)/h2 (D(T) is the
   interregion diffusion coefficient and h is the characteristic thickness
   of the stratified layers) and the mass transfer process is dominated by
   interregion diffusion.  These scaling relations for alpha reflect the
   two mechanisms controlling the mass transfer process in locally
   stratified soils.  They have implications for scaling of time-dependent
   mass transfer from laboratory models to prototype soils.  In particular,
   the relationship alpha is-proportional-to V2/D leads to the conclusion
   that exact physical modeling of nonsorbing chemical transport coupled
   with apparent mass transfer in locally stratified soils may be viable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an investigation of flow and transport phenomena in
   heterogeneous, nonstationary formations, where the log conductivity is
   the superposition of a linear trend and a stationary fluctuation.  The
   problem of flow and transport in a steady, two-dimensional flow without
   recharge is investigated analytically for an infinite flow domain. 
   General results are obtained for any space dimensionality, but
   applications were limited to the case of two-dimensional flow in the
   horizontal plane.  The log conductivity field is assumed to have a
   linear trend.  We limited the scope of this study to the cases where the
   trend is either parallel or normal to the head gradient and to small
   variance in the log conductivity.  This paper presents results for the
   moments of the velocity and the hydraulic head, the effective
   conductivity, macrodispersion coefficients, solute mass breakthrough
   curves, and travel time distributions, all in terms of the parameters of
   the log conductivity field and the boundary conditions.  The effects of
   the trend in the conductivity on these results are analyzed and compared
   with those obtained when the apparent trend is neglected.  The results
   may be used for predicting transport phenomena extending over distances
   of many integral scales, as well as for interpretation of field data
   where the presence of a trend is suspected.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new Eulerian-Lagrangian method for modeling flow
   and transport of passive solutes in heterogeneous porous formations. 
   The physically plausible random velocity fields are generated by a
   geostatistical based model.  The ability of the method to correctly
   reproduce the velocity field statistics and to satisfy mass balance is
   tested and demonstrated for the case of two-dimensional flow.  The
   method is found particularly useful in dealing with large fields where
   numerical, fixed grid methods such as finite difference or finite
   elements become very demanding from a computational point of view.  The
   transport problem is solved in a Lagrangian framework by the
   particle-tracking approach which uses a suitable grid refinement to
   correctly handle the velocity fluctuation at any a priori defined
   resolution.  The new method is employed to compute the probability
   distribution functions of the concentration and travel times and to
   investigate the limitations of existing methods for predicting

Abstract = {{The hydraulic properties of an unsaturated homogenous and isotropic soil
   can be obtained from the unconfined flux out of a disc infiltrometer
   into the soil over the depth of wetting.  The disc infiltrometer is
   becoming increasingly popular, but methods of analysis have generally
   relied on the restrictive assumptions of one-dimensional flow at early
   times or quasi-steady state flow at large times.  We provide an
   approximate analytical expression for three-dimensional unsteady,
   unconfined flow out of a disc infiltrometer, and this includes the
   geometric effect of the circular source but ignores gravity.  This
   physically based solution is tested against data obtained from
   laboratory experiments on repacked material.  The results illustrate
   that the difference between three-dimensional and one-dimensional flow
   is linear with time.}},

Abstract = {{We present a convective description of acid-base transport in porous
   media which is based on classical one-component nonlinear
   chromatographic theory applied to the acidity of the system. In the
   mobile phase the solution acidity is given by c = {[}H+]t - {[}OH-]t,
   where {[}H+]t and {[}OH-]t are the total solution concentrations of H+
   and OH-, respectively. In the stationary phase the surface acidity
   corresponds to the charge density sigma, which is commonly presented as
   a function of pH of the solution. The response of a chromatographic
   column to a step pH change at column inlet results in a pH breakthrough
   curve which consists of a combined chromatographic front. This combined
   front begins with a diffuse subfront and ends with a self-sharpening
   subfront. The present chromatographic theory is used to predict
   experimentally observed pH breakthrough curves for columns filled with
   materials of known pH-dependent charging behavior. Good agreement
   between theoretical predictions and experimental results is observed.
   Essentially, the same chromatographic theory is used to explain pH
   breakthrough curves when the salinity of the input solution is changed.
   This situation leads usually to an additional nonretarded front where a
   change in pH occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR) is currently under active
   investigation as one of the most promising alternatives to conventional
   pump-and-treat remediation for aquifers contaminated by dense nonaqueous
   phase organic liquids. An existing three-dimensional finite-difference
   enhanced oil recovery simulator is adapted to model the SEAR process.
   This simulator incorporates the complex chemistry and multiphase
   transport behavior of surfactant/water/organic mixtures in permeable
   media. Model governing equations and parameter requirements are
   discussed, and simulations are employed to illustrate some important
   issues potentially affecting SEAR performance at the field scale.
   Simulations suggest that the total time for remediation could be reduced
   by more than an order of magnitude over conventional remediation
   approaches by employing SEAR. The assumptions, approximations, and
   conditions required to achieve such a favorable result are identified,
   and the importance of modeling as a quantitative tool for the assessment
   of SEAR is highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{The computational burden associated with multidimensional,
   multicomponent, numerical solute transport models can be prohibitive. 
   To solve these CPU intensive problems efficiently and accurately, we
   have implemented and extended a local adaptive grid refinement method of
   Berger and Oliger (1984) to track error-prone regions and supply
   high-resolution subgrids where they are locally needed while maintaining
   relatively few nodes elsewhere on a coarse, base grid.  Novel features
   include a unique method for detecting a priori where the numerical error
   is unacceptable, variable time step control which allows smaller time
   steps on subgrids than on the base grid, and a modular framework which
   allows easy exchange of partial differential equation solvers to
   accommodate different problem formulations.  Three examples show how the
   subgrids track the error-prone regions, how multiple subgrids are used
   for geometrically complex front shapes, and how increased resolution is
   provided for self-sharpening fronts when multiple reacting species are
   considered.  For all three examples, solutions with accuracies
   comparable to those achieved with a uniform fine grid are obtained at
   between 20 and 30\% of the computational cost.}},

Abstract = {{A major element in constructing a groundwater model is choosing the
   parameter values. The traditional approach is to aim for a single best
   set of values. The parameters used in a model are effective rather than
   measureable, and this combined with the inherent uncertainties in the
   modeling process means that there are often many plausible sets of
   values. A single prediction obtained from a single set of parameter
   values is not appropriate, but rather the range in predictions from the
   alternative calibrations should be used. A method is presented for
   finding the best case and worst case predictions among the plausible
   parameter sets and is applied to a real case study. Widely different
   feasible parameter sets were found giving significantly different
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Selected groundwater flow scenarios are used in a two-way comparison
   between the mixed hybrid finite element method and the standard finite
   element method (also called the conforming finite element method).  The
   simulations presented are performed in the bidimensional case with a
   triangular space discretization because of its practical interest for
   hydrogeologists.  The basic idea of the mixed procedure is to
   approximate both the hydraulic potential and the velocity simultaneously
   and to satisfy an exact water balance for each element.  By contrast,
   the conforming finite element method calculates the potential field
   everywhere and then calculates the velocity by differentiation of the
   potential.  The conventional approach results in an elementwise constant
   velocity which can be subject to significant problems because of the
   normal component discontinuity of the velocity.  The mixed hybrid finite
   element method provides velocities everywhere in the field, as well as
   potentials at the center of each element and each edge.  Moreover, the
   normal component of the velocity field is continuous between adjacent
   elements.  The results of the simulations are presented in the form of
   streamlines.  To avoid the problem of velocity discontinuity, the method
   of Cordes and Kinzelbach (1992) is used; it allows the construction of a
   continuous velocity field from potentials obtained by the confirming
   finite element method.  The comparison studies show that the mixed
   hybrid finite element is superior to the conforming method in terms of
   accuracy.  It is also superior to the conforming method in terms of
   computational effort.  The potential fields obtained by the mixed hybrid
   and the conforming finite element methods are the same.}},

Abstract = {{Partitioning of a species between aqueous solution and sorbed phases is
   commonly described as an equilibrium process and modeled by a sorption
   isotherm. These sorption models may be derived from the cumulative
   effect of many underlying specific reactions. However, in heterogenous
   systems, such as soils, the full array of these reactions and the
   relative contribution of each are unknown. This problem may be
   circumvented, without sacrificing consistency with the underlying
   reactions, by use of a sorption isotherm which faithfully describes
   measured sorption behavior. Since transport predictions based on one or
   another isotherm model may be quite different, careful choice of an
   isotherm is critical. The objective of this study was to examine the
   effect of isotherm type on predicted solute mobility in soil. The
   derivation of several isotherms from either specific reactions or a
   combination of `'local'' isotherms with weighting functions is first
   presented. The use of Freundlich and logarithmic Scatchard plots for
   selecting the proper sorption isotherm is discussed. Isotherm models,
   fit to experimental data from the literature, are then used in a
   transport simulation model. Differences between results are discussed.
   Also, a brief sensitivity analysis which shows the effects of isotherm
   parameters on transport behavior is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Unlike radial flow to a well the pattern of flow to a trench changes
   with time.  Flow vectors at early times are normal to the surface of the
   trench and affect a small area, whereas after a long period of pumping
   they converge radially from large distances.  This changing flow pattern
   controls performance, and ignoring the transient effects can results in
   errors when predicting flows in the vicinity of a trench.  The method of
   instantaneous source functions is used to obtain transient analytical
   solutions to a variety of two- or three-dimensional problems related to
   interceptor trenches.  Drawdown in the vicinity of a trench that is
   pumped at constant rate and discharge from a trench that is held at
   constant drawdown are given as functions of time.  Travel times to
   trenches in regional flow fields are also obtained and expressed in
   dimensionless form.  Applications of the results include improved
   predictions of the performance of environmental applications of
   interceptor trenches and estimation of aquifer parameters from the
   analysis of pump tests from trenches.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of digital elevation model (DEM) map scale and data
   resolution on watershed model predictions of hydrologic characteristics
   were determined for TOPMODEL, a topography-based watershed model.  The
   effects of topography on watershed hydrology are represented in TOPMODEL
   as the distribution of ln (a/tan B), where ln is the Napierian
   logarithm, a is the upslope area per unit contour length, and tan B is
   the gravitational gradient.  The minimum, maximum, mean, variance, and
   skew values of the ln (a/tan B) distribution were computed from
   1:24,000-scale (24K) DEMs at 30- and 90-m resolutions and from
   1:250,000-scale (250K) DEMs at 90-m resolution for 71 areas in
   Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey.  An analysis of TOPMODEL showed
   that model predictions of the depth to the water table, the ratio of
   overland flow to total flow, peak flow, and variance and skew of
   predicted streamflow were affected by both the DEM map scale and data
   resolution.  Further TOPMODEL analyses showed that the effects of DEM
   map scale and data resolution on model predictions were due to the
   sensitivity of the predictions to the mean of the ln (a/tan B)
   distribution, which was affected by both DEM map scale and data
   resolution.  DEM map scale affected the mean of the ln (a/tan B)
   distribution through its influence on the mean of the ln (a)
   distribution, which characterizes land-surface shape, and the mean of ln
   (1/tan B) distribution, which characterizes land-surface slope.  DEM
   resolution, in contrast, affected the mean of the ln (a/tan B)
   distribution primarily by its influence on the mean of the ln (a)
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{The conditional sampling formulation typically used in eddy accumulation
   flux measurements was tested at two sites using velocity, temperature,
   and specific humidity time series measurements.  The first site was at
   Owen's Lake in southern California, and the second site was an irrigated
   bare soil field at the Campbell Tract facility in Davis, California. 
   The constant beta relating the turbulent flux to the accumulated
   concentration difference between updrafts and downdrafts was related to
   the statistics of the vertical velocity.  It was found that this
   formulation for beta reproduces the extreme fluxes (both senible and
   latent heat) better than previous beta formulations.  The overall
   comparison between eddy correlation measured fluxes and conditional
   sampling predicted fluxes for a wide range of atmospheric stability
   conditions was excellent (R2 = 0.97).  On average, the mean beta
   obtained from our experiments for temperature and water vapor is in good
   agreement (+/-4\%) with other reported beta values for carbon dioxide,
   water vapor, ozone, and temperature.  These results suggest that the
   conditional sampling formulation used in eddy accumulation methods is
   useful for routine flux measurements of passive greenhouse gases.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the model development component of a body of
   research which addresses aggregation and scaling in multiscale
   hydrological modeling.  Water and energy balance models are developed at
   the local and catchment scales and at the macroscale by aggregating a
   simple soil-vegetation--atmoshere transfer scheme (SVATS) across scales
   in a topographic framework.  A spatially distributed approach is
   followed to aggregate the SVATS to the catchment scale.  A
   statistical-dynamical approach is utilized to simplify the large-scale
   modeling problem and to aggregate the SVATS to the macroscale.  The
   resulting macroscale hydrological model is proposed for use as a land
   surface parameterization in atmospheric models.  It differs greatly from
   the current generation of land surface parameterizations owing to its
   simplified representation of vertical process physics and its
   statistical representation of horizontally heterogeneous runoff and
   energy balance processes.  The spatially distributed model formulation
   is explored to understand the role of spatial variability in determining
   areal-average fluxes and the dynamics of hydrological processes.  The
   simpler macroscale formulation is analyzed to determine how it
   represents these important dynamics, with implications for the
   parameterization of runoff and energy balance processes in atmospheric
   models.}},

Abstract = {{The models presented in the previous paper (Famiglietti and Wood, this
   issue) are applied at their appropriate scales for evapotranspiration
   modeling at the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology
   Project Field Experiment (FIFE) site.  The local
   soil-vegetation-atmospheric transfer scheme is applied at five flux
   measurement stations in the northwest quadrant of the FIFE site. 
   Simulations were performed for three of the four FIFE `'golden
   (cloud-free) days'' with good results.  The spatially distributed model
   was applied at the 11.7-km2 King's Creek catchment, also located in the
   northwest quadrant of the FIFE site, during FIFE Intensive Field
   Campaigns (IFCs) 1-4.  Simulated catchment average evaportranspiration
   was compared to an average of observations made at the five
   aforementioned measurement stations with good results.  The macroscale
   formulation was applied to both the King's Creek catchment and the
   entire 15-km FIFE site for evaportranspiration simulations.
   Macroscale model simulations for King's Creek were nearly identical to
   the spatially distributed results, implying that at this location and at
   this scale, the assumptions invoked in the development of the macroscale
   formulation are reasonable.  The macroscale model was also employed to
   simulate evaportranspiration from the entire 15-km site for the four
   golden days.  Simulated evapotranspiration rates show reasonably good
   agreement with the 22-station average of observations.  However, it is
   suggested that at 15-km and larger scales, simulation error may arise as
   a result of the macroscale assumptions of areally averaged atmospheric
   forcing, vegetation parameters, soil parameters, and the methods by
   which these data and other flux observations are aggregated.  A
   methodology to combat these problems at larger scales is reviewed.}},

Abstract = {{In the past several years, wetlands have become increasingly used for
   wastewater treatment purposes.  As a consequence, nutrient trapping and
   accumulation, particularly for phosphorus, have emerged as important
   environmental management issues.  To predict the effectiveness of
   wetlands for phosphorus removal, data from a large cross-sectional study
   and from a single wetland over time were obtained with the objective of
   developing a predictive model.  From the analysis of these data, it was
   found that phosphorus trapping is predictable using a simple function of
   phosphorus input and water loading.  Several statistical models of
   phosphorus trapping were developed and evaluated using the two data
   sets.  Particular emphasis was placed on generalized additive modeling,
   a graphics-oriented data-driven approach, for model diagnostic and
   model-building purposes.  A nonlinear model was recommended, and
   suggestions were made for future work.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmogenic nuclides produced in situ within minerals at the surface of
   the Earth are proving to be an effective means of assessing geomorphic
   histories. The use of multiple cosmogenic nuclides permits both exposure
   times and erosion rates to be determined. However, if two nuclides are
   produced only by spallation reactions, the systematic differences in
   their accumulation rates depend only on the differences in their
   production rates and half-lives. The relatively small differences that
   result require a high degree of analytical precision to yield useful
   results. In contrast to other spallogenic nuclides, Cl-36 is also
   produced by low-energy neutron absorption, which creates a different
   pattern of production as a function of depth. We have measured the
   thermal flux with depth in a concrete block using He-3-filled neutron
   detectors. The measured thermal neutron profile agrees well with
   predictions from a simple diffusion-based thermal neutron distribution
   model. Calculations of Cl-36 production using the model suggest that the
   use of Cl-36 along with a purely spallogenic nuclide to determine
   erosion rates and exposure times should be less sensitive to analytical
   error than are determinations from two purely spallogenic nuclides.}},

Abstract = {{Cosmogenic Cl-36 surface exposure ages obtained for multiple boulders
   from single landforms are usually characterized by a variance larger
   than that of the analytical methods employed.  This excessive
   boulder-to-boulder variability, progressively more profound with
   increasing age of landforms, is due to removal of soil and gradual
   exposure of boulders at the surface.  In our gradual exposure model,
   boulders are initially buried in moraine matrix.  With time, erosion
   lowers the moraine surface and the boulders are gradually exposed to
   cosmic rays.  Because the cosmic ray intensity changes with depth, the
   boulders are subjected to variable production rates of the cosmogenic
   Cl-36.  Initial depth of boulders and their chemical composition are
   variable, which results in different amounts of the accumulated
   cosmogenic Cl-36 and thus different apparent ages of boulders.  The
   shape of the resulting distribution of the apparent ages and the
   coefficient of variation depend on the erosion depth, while the first
   moment is a function of the true surface age and the erosion depth. 
   These properties of the apparent age distributions permit calculation of
   the surface age, the erosion depth, and also the average erosion rate. 
   We tested the model calculations using 26 boulders from a late
   Pleistocene moraine at Bishop Creek, Sierra Nevada, California.  The set
   exhibited a bimodal distribution of the Cl-36 surface exposure ages.  We
   interpreted the older mode as the result of gradual exposure and the
   younger one as the result of surficial processes other than soil
   removal.  The 10 samples that constitute the older mode produced a
   distribution which closely matches the modeled distribution calculated
   using an age of 85 kyr and erosion depth of 570 g cm-2.  This age is the
   same as an independent estimate obtained from cation ratio studies, and
   the calculated erosion depth is very close to the erosion depth of 600 g
   cm-2 based on a simple analytical model of soil erosion.  These results
   indicate that our statistical model adequately describes effects of soil
   erosion on accumulation of cosmogenic Cl-36.  The approach can be used
   to simultaneously obtain the true landform age and the erosion rate from
   apparent Cl-36 ages and therefore may help in evaluation of surface
   exposure ages of eroding landforms.}},

Abstract = {{MINTRAN is a new model for simulating transport of multiple
   thermodynamically reacting chemical substances in groundwater systems. 
   It consists of two main modules, a finite element transport module
   (PLUME2D), and an equilibrium geochemistry module (MINTEQA2).  Making
   use of the local equilibrium assumption, the inherent chemical
   nonlinearity is confined to the chemical domain.  This linearizes the
   coupling between the physical and chemical processes and leads to a
   simple and efficient two-step sequential solution algorithm.  The
   advantages of the coupled model include access to the comprehensive
   geochemical database of MINTEQA2 and the ability to simulate
   hydrogeological systems with realistic aquifer properties and boundary
   conditions under complex geochemical conditions.  The model is primarily
   targeted toward groundwater contamination due to acidic mine tailings
   effluents but is potentially also applicable to the full range of
   geochemical scenarios covered by MINTEQA2.  The model is tested with
   respect to ion exchange chemistry and with respect to
   precipitation/dissolution chemistry involving multiple sharp fronts. 
   The companion paper presents two-dimensional simulations of heavy metal
   transport in an acidic mine tailings environment, focusing on
   environmental implications.}},

Abstract = {{The mobility of potentially toxic dissolved metals discharged from a
   mine tailings source into an aquifer is investigated by using the
   multicomponent reactive transport model MINTRAN.  A generic aquifer
   resembling a site in northern Ontario is used as a basis, and a scenario
   analysis is performed to determine the effect of terminating the source
   input of acidity and dissolved metals after a finite time.  It is found
   that for most metals the buffering reactions in the carbonate aquifer
   lower the dissolved metal concentrations substantially, often by several
   orders of magnitude.  In the case of a 12-year source duration, most
   metals are effectively immobilized by precipitation, and the
   concentrations of metals remaining in solution are well below drinking
   water limits.  The risk of contamination of water resources by toxic
   metals can thus be controlled.}},

Abstract = {{Recently developed models for the estimation of risks arising from the
   release of toxic chemicals from hazardous waste sites are inherently
   complex both structurally and parametrically.  To better understand the
   impact of uncertainty and interaction in the high-dimensional parameter
   spaces of these models, the set of procedures termed regional
   sensitivity analysis has been extended and applied to the groundwater
   pathway of the MMSOILS model.  The extension consists of a
   tree-structured density estimation technique which allows the
   characterization of complex interaction in that portion of the parameter
   space which gives rise to successful simulation.  Results show that the
   parameter space can be partitioned into small, densely populated regions
   and relatively large, sparsely populated regions.  From the high-density
   regions one can identify the important or controlling parameters as well
   as the interaction between parameters in different local areas of the
   space.  This new tool can provide guidance in the analysis and
   interpretation of site-specific application of these complex models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and application of an optimal
   control system designed to reduce the deviation of piezometric head from
   minimum monthly target levels.  The control strategy is generated from a
   Box-Jenkins double input-single output transfer function (SARIMAX) model
   relating local piezometric head fluctuations at an ecologically
   vulnerable location to regional rainfall and pumping volumes.  The
   optimal control scheme is developed to minimize head deviations from the
   minimum target levels while simultaneously satisfying pumping/injection
   constraints associated with predetermined water resource management
   preferences.  The control action manipulates the control variable
   (pumping) to compensate for existing and expected deviations of the
   piezometric head from target levels due to both observed disturbances
   (i.e., rainfall) and random (i.e., white noise) disturbances.  An
   example applied to a localized region of the Upper Floridan aquifer in
   northeast Florida shows that the control action reduces the number of
   deviations below target head levels by 79\% and the magnitude of the
   mean deviation below target by 72\%.  This improvement was achieved
   through a 29\% reduction in pumping volume.  The optimal control system
   thus provides a useful means of managing groundwater fluctuations at
   ecologically vulnerable locations by restricting regional pumping to
   offset regional rainfall deficits.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation/optimization model is developed for maximizing irrigated
   crop yield while avoiding unacceptable pesticide leaching.  The
   optimization model is designed to help managers prevent non-point source
   contamination of shallow groundwater aquifers.  It computes optimal
   irrigation amounts for given soil, crop, chemical, and weather data and
   irrigation frequencies.  It directly computes the minimum irrigated crop
   yield reduction needed to prevent groundwater contamination.  Constraint
   equations used in the model maintain a layered soil moisture volume
   balance; describe percolation, downward unsaturated zone solute
   transport and pesticide degradation; and limit the amount of pesticide
   reaching groundwater.  Constraints are linear, piecewise linear,
   nonlinear, and exponential.  The problem is solved using nonlinear
   programming optimization.  The model is tested for different scenarios
   of irrigating corn.  The modeling approach is promising as a tool to aid
   in the development of environmentally sound agricultural production
   practices.  It allows direct estimation of trade-offs between crop
   production and groundwater protection for different management
   approaches.  More frequent irrigation tends to give better crop yield
   and reduce solute movement.  Trade-offs decrease with increasing
   irrigation frequency.  More frequent irrigation reduces yield loss due
   to moisture stress and requires less water to fill the root zone to
   field capacity.  This prevents the solute from moving to deeper soil
   layers.  Yield-environmental quality trade-offs are smaller for deeper
   groundwater tables because deeper groundwater allows more time for
   chemical degradation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a nonlinear disaggregation technique for the
   operation of multireservoir systems.  The disaggregation is done by
   training a neural network to give, for an aggregated storage level, the
   storage level of each reservoir of the system.  The training set is
   obtained by solving the deterministic operating problem of a large
   number of equally likely flow sequences.  The training is achieved using
   the back propagation method, and the minimization of the quadratic error
   is computed by a variable step gradient method.  The aggregated storage
   level can be determined by stochastic dynamic programming in which all
   hydroelectric installations are aggregated to form one equivalent
   reservoir.  The results of applying the learning disaggregation
   technique to Quebec's La Grande river are reported, and a comparison
   with the principal component analysis disaggregation technique is given.}},

Abstract = {{A physically based model for advective sediment transport during rill
   initiation is developed based on (1) a short-wavelength rescaling of the
   momentum balance equations for the surface water flux; (2) a deforming
   coordinate system which characterizes local morphological changes of the
   surface during erosion; and (3) a generalized transport function for the
   surface sediment flux which distinguishes the contributions of diffusive
   and advective transport. A linear stability analysis of the coupled
   system indicates that an intrinsic minimum transverse length scale for
   rill initiation is forced by the cross-slope pressure gradient in the
   surface water. The wavelength of this initial rill spacing is dependent
   upon the relative significance of the advective component of sediment
   transport and the hydraulic efficiency of the surface water flux and is
   independent of the total length of the hillslope. The hydrodynamic model
   presented can also be used to evaluate the nonlinear development of
   rills and rill networks, subsequent to initiation.}},

Abstract = {{A reanalysis of the 1978 tracer experiment at Borden, Ontario, is
   performed using spatial moments.  The tracer experiment involved the
   uniform injection of chloride ions into an aquifer, and the resulting
   plume was allowed to migrate under natural gradient conditions. 
   Detailed monitoring of the evolving plume was then performed in three
   dimensions.  The work of Sudicky et al. (1983) showed that the solute
   cloud evolved as two plumes owing to variations in hydraulic
   conductivity at the site.  In this paper we compute the zeroth through
   the fourth spatial moments of the plume in the lower hydraulic
   conductivity zone.  From these moments the solute mass of the plume, the
   velocity of the center of mass, the dispersion, the skew, and the
   kurtosis of the plume are calculated.  These results are compared with
   the results of Sudicky et al. as well as with the theoretical results of
   Gelhar et al. (1979) and Naff (1990).  Our computed plume velocity and
   apparent horizontal transverse macrodispersivity are in agreement with
   the estimates of Sudicky et al.; however, our apparent longitudinal
   macrodispersivity estimate exceeds that of Sudicky et al. by a factor of
   2.  The apparent horizontal transverse macrodispersivity obtained is
   also quite similar to that of Freyberg (1986).  At early times, the
   plume is found to be positively skewed as well as platykurtic.  This
   supports the findings of Gelhar et al. and contradicts those of Naff.}},

   The derivation is based on integration by parts of the

   calculus used in other derivations.  The analysis highlights the
   fundamental nature of the drift term, which is the term that needs to be
   added to the mean velocity to account for variability in the dispersion
   coefficients and thus provide physically reasonable results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the three-dimensional block hydraulic conductivity
   of blocks of limited size in cross-bedded sediments of meandering
   rivers.  Based on a simplified sedimentological model of a single point
   bar, a stochastic model is proposed to simulate the spatial distribution
   of core scale conductivities within point bar deposits.  The required
   parameters for these simulations are obtained from actual hydraulic
   conductivity measurements and sedimentological field data.  The
   simulations are then used to calculate the three-dimensional block
   conductivity tensor with a numerical upscaling procedure.  The
   stochastic simulation model is used to investigate the influence of
   slope and aspect angle of the cross-beds and the core scale anisotropy
   ratio on the block hydraulic conductivity.  It is expected that the
   off-diagonal elements of the block conductivity tensor generally cannot
   be neglected.  The core scale anisotropy ratio, which reflects the small
   scale layering within the cross-beds, can potentially have a significant
   impact on the elements of the block conductivity tensor.}},

Abstract = {{To describe the flow of water in unsaturated soils, the constitutive
   relationships of capillary pressure and relative permeability are
   necessary.  To measure these relationships using traditional methods may
   require different experimental apparatuses and can be time-consuming,
   particularly for multiple drainage and imbibition relationships for
   systems containing surfactants at various concentrations.  Thus a
   critical need exists for an apparatus that can make rapid measurements. 
   This paper outlines the design of an automated apparatus that can
   produce both capillary pressure and relative permeability relationships
   simultaneously and rapidly.  The rapidity of the measurements is based
   on the use of a thin soil sample, a highly conductive capillary barrier,
   and stripper tensiometers.  The capillary pressure is changed
   externally, with the change within the sample monitored through the use
   of tensiometers.  Saturation is determined by monitoring the cumulative
   effluent, with the accuracy of the mass balance enhanced through the
   active removal of air bubbles from beneath the capillary barrier.  A
   comparison of capillary pressure relationships for a fine-grained sandy
   porous medium produced with this apparatus with those produced with a
   Tempe cell shows that this apparatus yields comparable measurements in
   about 2\% of the time.  Thus the burden of making multiple transport
   property measurements can be reduced considerably through the use of
   this apparatus.}},

Abstract = {{Soil vapor extraction (SVE) is a technique that is commonly used to
   remove volatile organic compounds from the vadose zone.  Recent research
   has demonstrated that rate-limited sorption and desorption of these
   compounds can have a profound impact on the concentration reductions
   achievable by SVE.  In this note, one-dimensional equations presented by
   Brusseau (1991), which describe rate-limited transport of sorbing
   organic compounds in the vadose zone, are modified to model a SVE
   remediation at an idealized site and analytically solved.  The
   analytical model presented herein describes transport of a sorbing
   organic contaminant in a converging radial flow field in the vadose
   zone, with sorption rate limitations described by first-order rate
   expressions.  The model equations are solved in the Laplace domain and
   numerically inverted to simulate contaminant concentrations at an
   extraction well.  A Laplace domain solution for the total contaminant
   mass remaining in the vadose zone is also derived.  It is shown that
   under certain conditions, rate-limited sorption can have a significant
   impact upon SVE remediation in the vadose zone.  The solutions presented
   in this note may be useful in verifying numerical codes which are being
   developed to model organic transport in the vadose zone under conditions
   of rate-limited sorption.}},

Abstract = {{The random, two-dimensional, and steady in time Eulerian velocity field
   is assumed to be given.  It pertains to flow through heterogeneous
   porous media of spatially variable permeability.  Advective transport of
   a passive scalar is modeled by the Lagrangian approach by seeking the
   statistical moments of the trajectory of a tagged particle.  The
   trajectories' variances and the associated dispersion coefficients are
   evaluated by a perturbation expansion in the velocity variances and by
   Corrsin's conjecture.  First-order results obtained in the past show
   that for flow through porous formations of log-permeability, two-point
   covariance of finite integral scale, the transverse dispersion
   coefficient tends asymptotically to zero.  In contrast, Corrsin's
   conjecture leads to a finite dispersion coefficient, quadratic in the
   velocity variance.  To investigate this effect, an exact nonlinear
   correction to the transverse dispersion coefficient is derived for a
   normal velocity field.  It is shown that this term tends to zero
   asymptotically, in contrast with the result based on Corrsin's
   conjecture.  Furthermore, an illustrative computation shows the
   transport-related nonlinear correction to be small at any time.}},

Abstract = {{The Southern Oscillation index (SOI) can yield information about
   subsequent streamflows on the South Island of New Zealand; however, the
   relationship between streamflow and SOI may be nonlinear and
   heteroscedastic.  To deal with such difficulties, the conditional
   probability of streamflow's being below a critical magnitude, given a
   prior observation of SOI, can be considered a random variable, with its
   probability density function (pdf) estimated by Bayesian analysis of
   existing observations of streamflow and SOI.  The conditional pdf can
   yield a probabilistic forecast of critically low streamflows given a
   precursor value of SOI.  In the Clutha River basin of New Zealand,
   average austral summer inflow to the headwater lakes has an
   unconditional probability of nonexceedance of 360 m3/s of approximately
   17\%.  However, during a moderate La Nina, average austral spring SOI =
   12, the conditional probability of nonexceedance has an expected value
   of 55\%.  For an El Nino with a spring SOI of -12, the expected
   probability of nonexceedance is 18\%; for a neutral SOI of 0, the
   expected probability is 10\%.  Thus, the probability of nonexceedance of
   seasonal streamflow can be seen to vary by a factor of more than 5 as a
   function of the SOI.}},

Abstract = {{The cross-correlation function (CCF) and autocorrelation function (ACF)
   for Great Lakes annual net basin supplies are derived under the
   assumptions that annual lake outflows and water levels are
   autoregressive lag 1 processes and that each lake behaves as a linear
   reservoir.  Except for the pairing between Lakes Superior and
   Michigan-Huron, there is reasonable agreement between the sample and
   predicted CCFs, especially among net basin supplies to the small lower
   basin lakes.  The derived ACFs reduce to an expression identical in form
   to the ACF for an ARMA(1, 1) process at all the Great Lakes except Lake
   Michigan-Huron.  At the upper basin lakes, sample and predicted ACFs
   drop to zero rapidly.  At the lower basin lakes the ACFs exhibit a much
   more gradual decay, suggesting the presence of long-term persistence. 
   Prominent tails in the ACFs of the annual net basin supplies have been
   attributed to historical shifts in the precipitation regime at the lower
   basin lakes.  Results from this study show that the residual method
   currently used to estimate net basin supplies can also induce a similar
   artificial long tail in the ACF.  This observation has important
   ramifications in efforts to simulate Great Lakes water levels, since
   simulation results are quite sensitive to the covariance structure of
   the annual net basin supplies.}},

Abstract = {{The definition of preevent soil moisture profile and time compression
   analysis are critical components in water balance models that are based
   on realistic infiltration/exfiltration relations and include profile
   redistribution of vadose zone moisture.  In this paper, detailed
   analysis of these two fundamental components of water balance modeling
   is presented.  Numerical integration of the governing equations for
   liquid moisture flow in the unsaturated zone is used in simulations
   designed to illustrate the role of temporal variability in the system. 
   The simulations consist of forcing the surface of a one-dimensional soil
   column, bounded at its based by a fixed water table, with the output of
   a stochastic event-based model of precipitation and potential
   evaporation.  The simulations are run until (and beyond when) an
   equilibrium condition is reached between the long-term mean values of
   surface and bottom fluxes.  For situations with a deep water table, two
   distinct zones develop:  a near-surface, highly unsteady zone, and a
   deeper, quasi-steady zone.  The equivalent steady moisture profile,
   i.e., the steady profile corresponding to the mean of the simulated
   column flow, is found to reasonably approximate the temporal mean, mean
   prestorm, and mean poststorm moisture profiles, particularly in the
   deeper zone.  In the upper zone the equivalent steady profile forms a
   biased estimate of the temporal mean.  The bias is shown, through
   perturbation analysis, to lead to overestimation of the wetness of the
   mean moisture profile.  For shallow water tables the distinction between
   the two zones collapses.  In this case both the equivalent steady
   profile and the mean profile are close to the hydrostatic profile.  The
   simulations are also used to test the utility of the time compression
   approximation (TCA) in modeling surface fluxes under temporally variable
   initial conditions.  We demonstrate that the use of the mean prestorm
   and poststorm event moisture profiles as initial conditions for the
   infiltration and exfiltration flux capacities does not produce major
   bias in TCA-predicted surface fluxes.  In this sense the TCA behaves as
   a linear operator.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the estimation of
   these mean initial condition profiles by the equivalent steady state
   soil moisture profile is an adequate approximation for determining mean
   land surface response to event-based atmospheric forcing.}},

Abstract = {{With minor modification an existing analytic model employing a simple
   statistical description of soil moisture dynamics is found to give
   accurate estimates of the mean water balance partitioning; comparisons
   are made to a Monte Carlo numerical simulation of unsaturated moisture
   flow in a soil column.  In the statistical-dynamical model the complex
   temporal and spatial characteristics of the soil moisture profile are
   approximated by a single effective soil moisture:  the equilibrium soil
   moisture (s0) for which the modeled long-term mean fluxes are in
   balance.  The relation between this equilibrium soil moisture and the
   equivalent steady state moisture profile (the steady profile which
   transmits the long-term mean flow) is discussed.  The test numerical
   integrations of the flow and conservation equations are designed to
   represent a deep one-dimensional soil column.  Soil surface boundary
   conditions are defined by the interaction of the surface soil moisture
   with a stochastic event-based atmospheric forcing model, allowing for
   state dependent switching from flux boundary conditions (rainfall
   intensity and potential evaporation) to concentration conditions (ponded
   and dry surface), thus simulating infiltration-excess runoff production
   and soil-limited evaporation.  The ability of the equilibrium model to
   estimate the mean water balance under a large range of soil textures
   (from clay to sand loam) and climate forcings (humid to arid) implies
   that the soil moisture profile may, for purposes of climate water
   balance, be represented in a simple fashion.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of rainfall-sampling errors on distributed hydrologic
   simulations was evaluated in a study conducted with localized
   thunderstorms and a midsized (150 km2) semiarid watershed.  Rainfall
   fields based on observations from a very dense rain gage network were
   compared to rainfall fields based on observations from a subset of the
   original gages.  The rain gage density of the `'sparse'' network (1 gage
   per 20 km2) was selected to represent the typical gage density of a
   local evaluation in real time (ALERT) type flash flood warning system. 
   Inadequate rain gage densities in the case of the sparse network
   produced errors in simulated peaks that, on the average, represented
   58\% of the observed peak flow.  Approximately half of the difference
   between observed and simulated peaks was due to rainfall-sampling
   errors.  Simulations were also conducted with rainfall that is similar
   to the next generation weather radar (NEXRAD) digital precipitation
   estimates in that it represents areal averages within 4 km x 4 km
   pixels.  Spatial averaging of rainfall over 4 km x 4 km pixels led to
   consistent reductions in simulated peaks that, on the average,
   represented 50\% of the observed peak flow.  Hence it appears that the
   current spatial resolution of ALERT-type precipitation measurements and
   4 km x 4 km radar precipitation estimates may not be sufficient to
   produce reliable rainfall-runoff simulations/forecasts in midsized
   watersheds of the southwestern United States subject to localized
   thunderstorms and large infiltration losses.}},

Abstract = {{An extension of the conceptual model earlier developed by Smith et al.
   (1993) is presented.  Their basic model considered the problem of point
   infiltration during a storm consisting of two parts separated by a
   rainfall hiatus, with surface saturation and runoff occurring in each
   part.  The model is here extended toward further generality, including
   the representation of a sequence of infiltration-redistribution cycles
   with situations not leading to soil surface saturation, and rainfall
   periods of intensity less than the soil infiltration capacity.  The
   model employs at most a two-part profile for simulating the actual one. 
   When the surface flux is not at capacity, it uses a slightly modified
   version of the Parlange et al. (1985) model for description of increases
   in the surface water content and the Smith et al. (1993) redistribution
   equation for decreases.  Criteria for the development of compound
   profiles and for their reduction to single profiles are also
   incorporated.  The extended model is tested by comparison with numerical
   solutions of Richards's equation, carried out for a variety of
   experiments upon two contrasting soils.  The model applications yield
   very accurate results and support its use as part of a watershed
   hydrologic model.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional lattice gas-cellular automaton fluid model with
   long-range interactions (Appert and Zaleski, 1990) is used to simulate
   saturated and unsaturated water infiltration in porous media.  Water and
   gas within the porous medium are simulated by applying the dense and the
   light phase, respectively, of the cellular automaton fluid.  Various
   wetting properties can be modeled when adjusting the corresponding
   solid-liquid interactions.  The lattice gas rules include a gravity
   force step to allow buoyancy-driven flow.  The model handles with ease
   complex geometries of the solid, and an algorithm for generating random
   porous media is presented.  The results of four types of simulation
   experiments are presented:  (1) We verified Poiseuille's law for steady
   and saturated flow between two parallel plates.  (2) We analyzed
   transient water infiltration between two parallel plates of varying
   degrees of saturation and various apertures.  (3) Philip's infiltration
   equation was adequately simulated in an unsaturated porous medium.  (4)
   Infiltration into an aggregated medium containing one vertical parallel
   crack was simulated.  Further applications of this lattice gas method
   for studying unsaturated flow in porous media are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Freshening of aquifers is accompanied by sequential elution of the
   saltwater (seawater) cations from the sediment's exchange complex. The
   resulting chromatographic patterns are modeled with a one-dimensional
   geochemical transport model that can handle the complex interplay of
   transport and mineral and ion exchange equilibria. The transport part is
   based on the mixing cell approach, with different time steps for
   advective and diffusive transport used when required by small grid size.
   The chemical reactions are calculated explicitly after each time step
   with the geochemical model PHREEQE. Ion exchange is included in the form
   of association half reactions, which allows simulation of the dynamic
   nature of the exchange process. The variation in the constant for proton
   association is obviated with an activity coefficient for H-X that is
   derived from the constant capacitance model. All coefficients for the
   exchange model are obtained by fitting to literature data to be able to
   perform the modeling as realistically as possible. The code is applied
   to a laboratory column experiment, and subsequently used to demonstrate
   chromatographic development of solute profiles in a freshening aquifer.
   Sequential peaks of Mg2+, K+, and Na+ along a flow path in the Aquia
   aquifer in Maryland are modeled, and the results confirm that the
   variation of water qualities in this aquifer has basically a
   chromatographic origin. Proton exchange acts here as a source of acid in
   NaHCO3 water in which calcite dissolves. This explains the Na+ to HCO3-
   ratio and high delta13C observed in these waters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes some economic issues involved with the common
   practice of using metered water rate revenue to fund debt retirement
   associated with the provision of municipal water and wastewater
   services.  We conclude that rather than simply raising the metered rate,
   city officials should seriously consider increasing the tax rate levied
   under the local property tax.  There is an important trade-off in the
   choice of a price policy.  An increased property tax rate can result in
   tax savings to some home owners, which lowers their net expenditure for
   water.  However, a corresponding decrease in the metered rate may
   increase water consumption, which in turn raises operating cost.  In
   order to do what is best for home owners, it might make sense to give
   other customers (e.g., a university) an easy ride, even if the latter,
   because of its low (inelastic) price elasticity of demand for water, is
   viewed by the municipality as a cash cow.}},

Abstract = {{In response to scarce financial resources, economists have promoted the
   concept of benefit transfer as a cost-effective alternative to new
   nonmarket valuation studies.  Recent discussion on benefit transfer for
   improved water quality has focused on recreational benefits.  While
   useful, the discussion must now be expanded to include another key
   benefit from improved water quality:  the reduction in risk to public
   health.  This paper develops a protocol for benefit transfer of
   long-term health risk reduction and presents a case study for surface
   water contamination.  Challenges such as the multiple sources of risk,
   the mortality and morbidity effects indicated by a variety of symptoms,
   the long latency period between cause and effect, and an individual's
   ability to privately or collectively reduce the probability or severity
   of the risk are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A recent focus of water quality policy discussions has been the trading
   of pollution abatement between point and nonpoint sources. 
   Point-nonpoint trading would allow point sources to sponsor nonpoint
   source controls rather than install further controls of their own.  If
   nonpoint source loadings are significant and the marginal costs of their
   control are lower than for additional point source controls, water
   quality goals could be met at lower cost with trading.  We isolate
   difficulties particular to incentive policies such as point-nonpoint
   trading and then screen coastal watersheds for those satisfying
   conditions that play a major role in determining whether trading can
   improve water quality.  We follow the recent Coastal Zone Act
   Reauthorization Amendments in emphasizing agriculture, the single
   largest cause of nonpoint source pollution.  Our screening analysis
   provides an initial, empirical assessment of the feasibility of trading
   for managing agricultural land use to protect coastal water quality.  We
   also illustrate the additional analysis required to quantify the
   potential for successful trading in those watersheds which meet our
   screening criteria.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling of flow and solutional processes within networks of
   interconnected conduits in limestone aquifers indicates that enlargement
   occurs very selectively during the early stages of karst aquifer
   development under laminar flow.  If initial flow paths are uniform in
   size, almost all enlargement occurs along a single set of connected
   conduits that lie along a direct path between recharge and discharge
   locations and are aligned along the hydraulic gradient.  With a
   sufficiently large variation in initial aperture widths, enlargement
   occurs along the flow path offering the least resistance to flow, but
   since flow rates in laminar flow are proportional to the fourth power of
   diameter but only linearly proportional to hydraulic gradient, the
   preferentially enlarged set of fractures may follow an indirect path. 
   Results disfavor earlier suggestions that nonselective cave patterns
   result from artesian flows (at least under laminar flow conditions) and
   that all passages should be competitive until the onset of turbulent
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note presents a comparison of cluster-based point
   rainfall models using the historical hourly rainfall data observed
   between 1949 and 1976 at Denver, Colorado.  The Denver data are used to
   analyze the performance of three classes of models, namely, the
   Bartlett-Lewis model, the geometric Neyman-Scott model and the Poisson
   Neyman-Scott model.  The original formulation of the structure of each
   model, as well as the modified description developed in order to improve
   the zero depth probability, is considered in this study. 
   Rodriguez-Iturbe et al. (1987a) concluded that it is unlikely that
   empirical analysis of rainfall data can be used to choose between the
   Bartlett-Lewis model and the Neyman-Scott model.  In a subsequent paper,
   Rodriguez-Iturbe et al. (1987b) argued that the choice of the
   distribution of the number of cells per storm for the Neyman-Scott
   model, either geometric or Poisson, has no general bias effect on the
   stochastic structure.  Some investigators (e.g., Burlando and Rosso,
   1991), however, reported results contradictory to those of the previous
   authors.  In light of these observations this note investigates the
   performance of the cluster-based models.  For the Denver data the
   geometric Neyman-Scott model yields better results compared to the
   Poisson Neyman-Scott model.  Moreover, the Bartlett-Lewis model is shown
   to be very sensitive to the sets of moment equations used in the
   parameter estimation.  This sensitivity is not observed in the
   Neyman-Scott scheme and is believed to be a drawback for applying the
   Bartlett-Lewis model in hydrologic simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variability of surface hydraulic properties and the extrinsic
   (e.g., traffic, cropping, etc.) and intrinsic (e.g., soil type, pore
   size distribution, etc.) factors; associated with these properties are
   important for infiltration and runoff processes in agricultural fields.
   Disc infiltrometers measured infiltration at 296 sites arranged on two
   parallel transects. To examine and differentiate the factors
   contributing to spatial structure under different field conditions these
   measurements were made in the corn rows, no-track interrows, and wheel
   track interrows of the field using four different soil water tensions
   Psi (0, 30, 60, and 150 mm). Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) and
   saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) were maximum in the corn rows and
   minimum in wheel track interrows, with no-track interrows intermediate.
   Exponents (alpha parameters) of K-s and K relationships (K = K-s
   exp(-alpha Psi)) for corn rows and no-track interrows were not
   significantly different from each other but were significantly different
   from ct for the wheel track interrows at P = 0.01 level. Spatial
   variability of K and K-s values showed some pseudoproportional effect in
   nugget variance for all three field conditions. No-track interrows
   clearly showed an inverse trend for semivariogram of K with changing
   tension (Psi) values, whereas differences were found for corn rows and
   wheel traffic interrows. The spatial structure of a: for all three field
   conditions were mostly white noise. Under corn rows, in addition to
   random variation, a small five-row periodic variation at the P = 0.20
   level, matching the five-row traffic configuration, was discovered. The
   spatial structure of ct was influenced by soil type for the no-track
   interrows. Spatial structure was absent in wheel track interrows,
   indicating the destruction of pore structure due to compaction.}},

Abstract = {{We present results from experiments on the migration of inorganic
   colloids through laboratory columns containing clean quartz sand.
   Particle retention on the quartz collectors was found to be
   substantially less in experiments using negatively charged silica (SiO2)
   colloids than in experiments using positively charged anatase (TiO2) or
   boehmite (AlOOH) colloids. Analysis of these data with respect to two
   different advection-dispersion models indicates that deposition of
   colloidal silica follows a first-order, reversible kinetics process,
   while deposition of both anatase and boehmite is more closely depicted
   by second-order kinetics. Fitted values of the rate constant used to
   describe particle attachment vary consistently with the mean grain size
   of the sand and, for anatase and boehmite, are within a factor of 2 of
   the values predicted on the basis of colloid filtration theory.}},

Abstract = {{Water repellency is an important property of many soils. It causes
   rainwater to penetrate into the soil as preferential flow paths, and
   solutes can reach the groundwater more rapidly than in the case of a
   homogeneous wetting. Water repellency depends on several factors which
   are principally related to the characteristics of the organic matter of
   the soil. A distinction between `'potential'' and `'actual'' water
   repellency and the assessment of the `'critical soil water content'' are
   introduced and highlighted in this paper. Persistence and degree of
   potential water repellency of dried samples were examined from 10
   trenches in a dune sand with grass cover using the water drop
   penetration time and the alcohol percentage tests. The spatial
   variability of water repellency and, therefore, soil wetting was
   extremely high. The actual water repellency was measured on field-moist
   samples to obtain critical soil water contents. The soil is wettable
   above and water repellent below these values. The critical soil water
   content varies between 4.75 vol \% at 5-10 cm and 1.75 vol \% at 45-50
   cm depth in this sandy soil.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of fingered flow in a water repellent sandy soil was
   studied in the field by sampling 10 vertical trenches in a 1-year cycle.
   In dry soil, fingers were formed in those places in the top layer which
   have the lowest degree of potential water repellency. The finger
   diameters varied roughly between 10 and 50 cm depending on the sequence
   of weather conditions. The fingers were wet in the topsoil and
   increasingly drier with depth. In none of the trenches sampled were
   there any serious indications of finger merger. The actual water
   repellent soil volumes between fingers were excluded from the transport
   of water and solutes for at least several hours. The temporal and
   spatial variability of these actual water repellent soil volumes is
   illustrated and evaluated with respect to simulation model development.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental evidence demonstrating gravity-driven wetting front
   instability in an initially dry natural fracture is presented. An
   experimental approach is developed using a transparent analog
   rough-walled fracture to explore gravity-driven instability. Three
   different boundary conditions were observed to produce unstable fronts
   in the analog fracture: application of fluid at less than the imbibition
   capacity, inversion of a density-stratified system, and redistribution
   of flow at the cessation of stable infiltration. The redistribution
   boundary condition (analogous to the cessation of ponded infiltration)
   is considered in a series of systematic experiments. Gravitational
   gradient and magnitude of the fluid input were varied during
   experimentation. Qualitative observations imply that finger development
   is strongly correlated to the structure of the imbibition front at the
   onset of flow redistribution. Measurements of fingertip velocity are
   used to develop a first-order relationship with fingertip length.
   Measured finger width is compared to theoretical predictions based on
   linear stability theory.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption of a reactive solute during transport in a fractured geologic
   medium is analyzed under the assumption that within each fracture,
   retardation varies in proportion to the product of a surface
   distribution coefficient and the specific surface area of the fracture
   (i.e., its surface area-to-volume ratio). This approach is analogous to
   the KD model commonly adopted for granular porous media. Numerical
   migration experiments in discrete fracture networks show that at the
   plume scale, retardation is both nonuniform and anisotropic. Different
   segments of the plume, or equivalently different breakthrough fractions
   at a downstream boundary, are retarded to a different degree. The degree
   to which various breakthrough fractions are retarded varies as a
   function of the orientation of the mean hydraulic gradient relative to
   the orientation of the fracture sets. This variation can be described in
   the form of a retardation ellipse. The mean arrival time is the only
   breakthrough fraction that is consistently described by a uniform,
   isotropic retardation factor. The degree of nonuniformity and anisotropy
   in the retardation factor is controlled largely by the difference in the
   mean apertures of each fracture set, the standard deviation in fracture
   aperture, and the orientation of the fracture sets relative to the mean
   hydraulic gradient. A larger variability in fracture aperture, or in the
   orientation of fractures within each set, promotes nonuniform
   retardation while reducing the degree of anisotropy in the retardation
   factor. Our results suggest that a transport model based on the
   conventional advection-dispersion equation, using a uniform retardation
   factor, may be conceptually incorrect, even for a dense fracture
   network. While the effects of nonuniform retardation modify the
   dispersive flux in a way that could be described by `'effective''
   dispersion coefficients, it is our opinion that a model formulation is
   needed that clearly separates chemical effects from those due to
   hydrodynamic dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical procedures for efficient mass conservative solutions of the
   head-based form of the Richards equation are presented. Mass
   conservative solutions are shown to result when the capacity
   coefficient, C, is formulated by equating the storage term and its chain
   rule expansion in their discretized forms. Equivalence in the storage
   term expansion is maintained in finite difference models when C is
   evaluated with a standard chord slope approximation. This scheme is
   shown to produce excellent global mass balance accuracy in simulations
   of vertical moisture infiltration, An analogous approach to the
   expansion of the storage term using finite elements results in element
   dependent expressions of C. Application of this approach produces mass
   balance accuracy with errors less than 1\%, but also exhibits slow
   convergence in the consistent form. A nontraditional finite element
   procedure is presented which maintains equivalence in the storage term
   expansion when C is evaluated with the standard chord slope
   approximation. This scheme exhibits excellent mass balance accuracy, in
   either the consistent or lumped forms, without significant loss in
   computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Insufficient understanding of winter hydrology conditions still hampers
   progress in predicting springtime discharge. The least known term in the
   winter water balance is evaporation, particularly of intercepted snow.
   Recent studies have shown that the evaporation from intercepted snow can
   be important. This paper elaborates factors governing evaporation of
   intercepted snow. Measurements with a cut tree-weighing device combined
   with a method to measure throughfall and drip gave a maximum evaporation
   rate of 0.3 +/- 0.06 mm/h or 3.3 +/- 0.06 mm/24 hours from a 6-m-high
   spruce. Calculations of evaporation with a combination equation and
   different ways to calculate the aerodynamic resistance and the
   evaporation from a snow-intercepted canopy during melt and sleet events
   showed that the most important factors for calculating the evaporation
   were the relative humidity, the aerodynamic resistance, the wind speed,
   and the intercepted mass. Less important factors were the energy to melt
   the intercepted snow, the method for calculating reduction in
   evaporation caused by a partly snow-covered canopy, accuracy in
   measurement of wind speed, air temperature, and net radiation.}},

Abstract = {{A model for drainage networks and their associated landscapes has been
   developed. This model is based on the minimum energy dissipation
   principle and an empirical relationship s similar to Q(alpha) between
   the slope s of each link in a channel network and the mean annual
   discharge Q that flows through it. The model was studied using six
   different values for the exponent alpha. The surfaces of these minimum
   energy dissipation drainage networks appear to be more complex than
   simple self-affine fractals. The drainage basins in these optimal
   drainage networks have power law size (area) distributions with a
   universal exponent, which is independent of the value of alpha. For the
   minimum energy dissipation drainage networks obtained using a particular
   value for a, the basin shapes are similar to each other. An empirical
   relationship has also been found to relate the basins' `'length-width''
   ratio to the value of alpha.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation was undertaken into how headwater tributaries of Brush
   Brook, Vermont, could have average pH differences of almost two units
   (4.75 and 6.7). Sampling along four tributaries revealed that mast of
   one tributary, below an area of seeps, had consistently higher pH, Ca2+,
   Mg2+, and K+, and lower Al than other sites. Bedrock mapping showed
   numerous fractures in vicinity of the seeps. A portion of this
   tributary's watershed and a portion of an acid tributary's watershed
   were intensively mapped for soil depth. Sampling showed the widespread
   existence of dense basal till in the watershed of the; acid tributary
   but none in:that of the near-neutral stream. Lateral flow, found above
   the dense till, was chemically similar to that of the acid tributary and
   to solutions sampled from soil B horizons. There were no differences in
   the average pH of nonseep soils sampled from either watershed. Flow
   paths are hypothesized to be through the B horizons in the acid
   tributaries and from below the soil profile in the near-neutral
   tributary. The acid catchment should be more sensitive to environmental
   change.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical transformation of organic contaminants in natural
   groundwater systems is clearly dependent upon local geochemistry which
   determines the thermodynamically favorable degradation reactions and the
   nature of local microbial populations. Conversely, groundwater
   geochemistry may be impacted Significantly in terms of pH and redox
   couple speciation by the chemical transformation of sufficient
   quantities of organic compounds. Therefore an understanding of the
   coupling between degradation reactions, local geochemistry, and chemical
   transport is essential in predicting the chemical evolution of
   contaminated aquifers. Equilibrium-based reactive chemical transport
   models are usually:not utilized for problems' involving the transport of
   degradable organic compounds due to slow reaction kinetics and the
   persistence of intermediate degradation products. In this study we
   propose a reactive geochemical transport model which considers these
   types of degradation reactions. An expert system approach is used to
   postulate a set of sequential, first-order degradation reactions for the
   organic compounds based upon thermodynamic considerations and
   user-defined rules. Redox disequilibrium provides the driving force for
   the abiotic or microbially mediated transformation of the organic
   compounds as well as the associated response of groundwater
   geochemistry. Coupling between local inorganic geochemistry and reacting
   organic compounds is achieved by assuring conservation of operational
   valence and mass balance. The composite geochemical model is in turn
   coupled with an integral finite difference transport algorithm using a
   two-step sequential Solution approach. The transport equation is solved
   separately for each inorganic aqueous species, complex, and dissolved
   organic species, allowing a high degree of flexibility in problem
   definition. We apply the model to an illustrative example problem
   concerning the introduction of aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated
   ethenes into an initially oxidizing aquifer. Modeling results agree well
   qualitatively with field and laboratory observations reported in the
   literature in terms of degradation patterns and the effects on
   groundwater geochemistry.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal design of a water distribution network is formulated as a
   two-stage decomposition model. The master (outer) problem is nonsmooth
   and nonconvex, while the inner problem is linear. A semi-infinite linear
   dual problem is presented, and an equivalent finite linear problem is
   developed. The overall design problem is solved globally by a branch and
   bound algorithm, using nonsmooth optimization and duality theory. The
   algorithm stops with a solution and a global bound, such that the
   difference between this bound and the true global optimum is within a
   prescribed tolerance. The algorithm has been programmed and applied to a
   number of examples from the literature. The results demonstrate its
   superiority over previous methods.}},

Title = {{MONITORING NETWORK DESIGN TO PROVIDE INITIAL DETECTION OF GROUNDWATER
   CONTAMINATION}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{The design of a monitoring network to provide initial detection of
   groundwater contamination at a waste disposal facility is complicated by
   uncertainty in both the characterization of the subsurface and the
   nature of the contaminant source. In addition, monitoring network design
   requires the resolution of multiple conflicting objectives. A method is
   presented that incorporates system uncertainty in monitoring network
   design and provides network alternatives that are noninferior with
   respect to several objectives. Monte Carlo simulation of groundwater
   contaminant transport is the method of uncertainty analysis. The random
   inputs to the simulation are the hydraulic conductivity field and the
   contaminant source location. The design objectives considered are (1)
   minimize the number of monitoring wells, (2) maximize the probability of
   detecting a contaminant leak, and (3) minimize the expected area of
   contamination at the time of detection. The network design problem is
   formulated as a multiobjective, integer programming problem and is
   solved using simulated annealing. An application of the method
   illustrates the configurations of noninferior network solutions and the
   trade-offs between objectives. The probability of detection can be
   increased either by using more monitoring wells or by locating the wells
   farther from the source. The latter case results in an increase in the
   average area of the detected contaminant plumes at the time of initial
   detection. If monitoring is carried out very close to the contaminant
   source to reduce the expected area of a detected plume, a large number
   of wells are required to provide a high probability of detection. A
   sensitivity analysis showed that the predicted performance of a given
   number of wells decreases significantly as the heterogeneity of the
   porous medium increases. In addition, a poor estimate of hydraulic
   conductivity was shown to result in optimistic estimates of network
   performance. In general, the trade-offs between monitoring objectives
   are an important factor in network design unless the cost (as expressed
   by the number of monitoring wells) is of limited concern.}},

Abstract = {{The sharp wetting front model of infiltration (Green and Ampt, 1911;
   Philip, 1954) yields through simple integration an exact solution
   relating the infiltration rate (i), cumulative infiltration (I), and
   time (t). The relation, however, is implicit for i or I; i.e., it is of
   the form t = A{[}I - B 1n (1 + I/B)]. Numerical iteration is required to
   find the infiltration rate, and furthermore, analytic manipulations are
   limited using this traditional formulation of the Green-Ampt
   infiltration. In this note we present an accurate expression for the
   infiltration rate in the form of a rapidly converging series in the
   variable tau = t/(t + chi). Truncating the series at four terms yields a
   useful expression for i(t). The proposed four-term expression gives less
   than 2\% error at all times and is readily integrated to yield the
   cumulative infiltration I(t). In conjunction with the exact expression
   for time (t) given i or I, the proposed expression is useful in
   infiltration/runoff calculations that necessitate the time compression
   approximation (TCA).}},

Abstract = {{A method of modeling freeze-thaw cycles of naturally deposited snowpacks
   is presented. The model involves the Stefan condition as an independent
   governing equation on the exterior moving boundary to calculate snowpack
   thinning, flow of water through a variably saturated layered porous
   medium as described by the Richards equation, and heat conduction with a
   phase change. The heat conduction problem was treated in two ways. Local
   heat conduction between a snow grain and its surrounding water film was
   treated by using a simple energy balance. Global heat conduction with a
   phase change (the Stefan problem) was introduced to calculate the
   space-time temperature distribution. In order to handle multiple
   interior moving boundaries, a specific form of the enthalpy formulation
   was used for heat conduction with a phase change. Changing material
   properties were considered according to the calculated meltwater
   refreezing.}},

Abstract = {{A flux-corrected transport (FCT) based numerical algorithm is developed
   to model the solute transport equation in heterogeneous variably
   saturated soils. The fully Eulerian algorithm is designed to model very
   steep gradients without the characteristic numerical
   diffusion/dispersion found in standard finite difference schemes. This
   algorithm can handle both small and infinite grid Peclet numbers but is
   limited to grid Courant numbers less than or equal to 0.5. Since useful
   results can be obtained for infinite Peclet numbers, the algorithm can
   be used to trace water movement when coupled with a numerical model for
   Richards' equation. We used the FCT based algorithm in conjunction with
   Richards' equation to model a hypothetical experiment at the Las Cruces
   Trench site. In this numerical experiment, water with tracer is applied
   across the top of a 24-m-wide domain. The two-dimensional distribution
   for the hydraulic properties estimated during site characterization is
   used to define the soil model. The predicted flow and tracer transport
   is quite complex. The movement of the wetting front appears to be
   heavily influenced by the old water, whereas the new water tends to
   bypass much of the old water indicating preferential flow.}},

Abstract = {{Simulation of water flow and transport processes in soils rely on field
   representative soil hydraulic functions. The near variability concept in
   combination with the inverse technique was used to estimate in situ soil
   hydraulic properties in a 32-ha field. Measured cumulative drainage
   curves were scaled yielding scaling factors. Subsequently, the drainage
   and moisture content distribution of the scaled reference profile were
   input to a numerical model to optimize the soil water retention and
   hydraulic conductivity curves for the reference soil profile by inverse
   solution of the scaled Richards equation. Field hydraulic functions for
   each location were computed from the reference curves and scaling
   factors. In addition, undisturbed soil cores taken from 0.3-m and 0.6-m
   depths at 44 locations were used to determine soil texture, and soil
   water retention and hydraulic conductivity curves in the laboratory
   using the multistep outflow technique. These hydraulic functions were
   scaled using the simultaneous scaling technique. The reference field
   hydraulic functions compared well with those determined from the soil
   cores taken from the 0.6-m depth. In situ saturated hydraulic
   conductivity variability was one order of magnitude less than that of
   the soil cores.}},

   vector field. This approach was applied to describe the global
   consequences of the Darcy law for steady groundwater flows in isotropic,
   heterogeneous aquifers. No particular model of the spatial variability
   of the hydraulic conductivity (K) was assumed. Vorticity in the flow
   paths was shown to exist wherever isoconductivity and equipotential
   surfaces intersect transversely, and the importance of the Lamb vector
   (the vector product of vorticity and specific discharge) for the
   geometry of flow paths was established. Because steady groundwater flows
   governed by the Darcy law have zero helicity, they cannot exhibit
   tangled vorticity lines or become chaotic. The absence of chaos is
   related closely to the impossibility of closed flow paths, the
   asymptotic stability of isolated minima of the hydraulic head (H), and
   the existence of a function H(K, H) on whose level surfaces all flow
   paths are confined. This last function also permits groundwater flows to
   be represented by moving points in the K, H plane, with motion there
   generated by a form of Hamilton's equations. The results obtained are
   not related to any stochastic approach to aquifer spatial variability,
   but instead may be applied to constrain stochastic models on purely
   dynamical grounds.}},

Abstract = {{The available approaches for analyzing pulse tests assume that the
   initiating pressure pulse is instantaneous. However, in practice this is
   difficult to achieve due to equipment response lags. A new model is
   derived which includes pulses of finite duration. This model is an
   extension of the instantaneous model of Bredehoeft and Papadopulos
   (1980), who presented an integral expression to explain behavior during
   a pulse test. In this paper, equations are derived for both
   instantaneous-and finite duration cases in Laplace space. These
   equations are numerically inverted to real space using the algorithm of
   Stehfest (1970). The finite duration pulse test model differs from the
   instantaneous model in an integral term which acts as a correction to
   the flow response. In order to numerically invert the finite duration
   equation the integral term is first numerically evaluated. An
   approximation is introduced to enable the explicit numerical integration
   of this term. The use of the instantaneous pulse model to analyze pulse
   tests which involve a finite duration results in error in the estimation
   of formation hydraulic properties. In one example considered, where the
   pulse was 30 s, the error was near zero for a specific storage cap city
   less than 1 x 10(-9) m-1 and the formation conductivity less than 1 x
   10(-9) m s-1. However, for the same test conditions, a conductivity of 1
   x 10(-8) m s-1 and a specific storage capacity of similar magnitude
   would result in an error of approximately 50\% in conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation of contaminated groundwater aquifers can be extremely
   difficult when desorption of the contaminant from the solid phase to the
   aqueous phase is slow. The effects of desorption rates on the
   feasibility of in situ bioremediation are investigated using an
   analytical solution to the solute transport equation with rate-limited
   desorption and first-order decay. Sensitivity analyses are used to
   identify when desorption or degradation is the rate-limiting process for
   bioremediation for the range of desorption rates, degradation rates, and
   equilibrium distribution coefficients reported in the literature. The
   results show that when the desorption coefficient is large relative to
   the degradation coefficient (degradation is rate limiting), the
   performance of in situ bioremediation compared to groundwater extraction
   is improved as the degradation rate increases. Degradation in the
   aqueous phase increases the concentration gradient between solid and
   aqueous phases, increasing the rate of desorption and thus the rate of
   remediation. However, when the desorption coefficient is small relative
   to the degradation coefficient (desorption is rate limiting), increasing
   the degradation rate any further will not improve the performance of in
   situ bioremediation. For sites that conform to the assumptions of the
   model and for which model parameters can be measured or estimated, the
   results can be used to perform a preliminary assessment of the
   feasibility of in situ bioremediation.}},

Abstract = {{Organic and inorganic compounds infiltrating into groundwater are
   subject to redox reactions catalyzed by bacteria. These bacteria tend to
   form conglomerates and to adsorb to the solid matrix. Assuming a biofilm
   concept, the mass transport in and near such a biofilm is a controlling
   factor for different processes affecting the microbial activity, such as
   the supply of the substrates to the bacteria or the detachment of
   biofilm parts by shear forces. We present here a macroscopic model for
   the transport of dissolved substances in groundwater-biofilm systems.
   This model conceptualizes the diffusion dominated microscopic transport
   processes within the biofilm by using a logistic approach based on a
   diffusional limitation. As biological processes, the growth, the
   maintenance, and the decay of the bacterial population are explicitly
   accounted for. The model is formulated for a one-dimensional flow and
   transport field and is numerically solved with an operator splitting
   technique as described by Zysset et al. (1994). It is able to reproduce
   the transport of nitrate and sulfate in two laboratory column
   experiments in which these substances served as dissolved electron
   acceptors in bacterially mediated redox reactions.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to probabilistic modeling of contaminant transport based on
   the first- and second-order reliability methods (FORM and SORM) is
   presented. FORM and SORM were initially developed for structural
   reliability applications to estimate the occurrence of low-probability
   events. They can be readily used with both analytical and numerical
   models and do not require restrictive assumptions about the problem
   geometry or about the properties of the media. Sensitivity information
   is obtained as an integral part of these analyses and is used to
   identify the variables or parameters which have a major influence on the
   estimate of probability. Example reliability analyses of one- and
   two-dimensional transport are used to illustrate the approach, and the
   accuracy of the reliability methods is evaluated in comparison with
   Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that FORM increasingly
   overestimates the probability of exceedance as the spatial variability
   of the domain increases. SORM, on the other hand, accounts for the
   nonlinearity of the limit state surface and gives results consistent
   with Monte Carlo simulation over a range of coefficient of variation of
   K from 0.1 to 0.7. In addition, the FORM/SORM analyses are shown to
   provide a computational advantage over the Monte Carlo simulation for
   low-probability events, because the computational effort is independent
   of the probability and the results also include sensitivity information.
   Finally, an example application of system reliability using FORM and
   SORM shows that problems with multiple limit state surfaces can be
   readily analyzed and the computational effort is proportional to the
   number and complexity of the limit state functions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method of semianalytical particle tracking
   analysis under transient conditions. To permit accurate particle
   tracking in transient flows, the particle velocity is interpolated
   linearly in both space and time coordinates within each finite
   difference cell and time step. By using the total derivative and this
   interpolation scheme, the particle velocity is derived and integrated
   analytically to obtain the particle's trajectory within each cell and
   time step. Errors are much smaller than in numerical integration
   schemes. Numerical experiments show that the transient semianalytical
   solutions are efficient and accurate.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model is used to examine groundwater flow in vertical
   section, near surface water bodies, such as lakes, wetlands, ponds,
   rivers, canals, and drainage and irrigation channels. Solutions are
   generated partly by superposition to achieve computational efficiency. A
   large number of flow regimes are identified, with their characteristics
   controlled by regional water table gradients, recharge to the aquifer,
   water body length, aquifer anisotropy, and the hydraulic resistance of
   the bottom sediments. Different flow regimes are distinguished by the
   presence and nature of groundwater mounds or depressions near the edges
   of a surface water body and by corresponding stagnation points. Ranges
   of values for dimensionless flow parameters over which particular
   regimes occur are determined for six representative geometries and
   presented in the form of transition diagrams. Increasing anisotropy or
   sediment resistance and decreasing the length of a water body relative
   to aquifer thickness are shown to have similar effects on flow geometry,
   the main effect being an increasing tendency for stagnation points to
   form in the interior of the aquifer. Flow-through behavior becomes more
   prevalent with decreasing anisotropy and sediment resistance and
   increasing water body length.}},

   transfers are for measuring water quality improvements. We consider
   transfers in which we assume no information on Milwaukee residents,
   limited (no behavioral) information, and some behavioral information. We
   consider simple transfers, model transfers, and updated transfers. In
   all cases we test the viability of the transfer by comparing it with
   benefits estimated from a random utility model estimated over the
   Milwaukee sample, which in effect is our `'true'' model. The values from
   the model and updated transfers typically deviated less than 10\% from
   the true values. Confidence intervals are estimated by using the
   Krinsky-Robb procedure for all of the benefit measures computed from the

Abstract = {{Flow pathways of water and solutes in soils form distinct patterns,
   which are not a priori predictable. Macropore structure is a prime
   cause, but other factors, such as differing initial or boundary
   conditions, may also predispose a soil to produce bypassing of
   infiltrating water. This study was conducted to assess the flow pathways
   of water in different soils and to investigate the effect of initial
   water content on the flow pattern. Dye-tracing experiments were carried
   out at 14 different field sites. The sites represent a good portion of
   soils used for agricultural crop production in Switzerland. Each site
   consisted of two 1.4 by 1.4 m plots, one of which had been covered with
   a plastic roof for two months before the experiment to achieve different
   initial water contents. Forty millimeters of water containing the dye
   Brilliant Blue FCF (C.I. Food Blue 2) were applied within 8 hours onto
   the plots with a sprinkling apparatus. One day after irrigation the
   plots were excavated, and the stained pattern was examined on a vertical
   1 by 1 m soil profile. The spatial structure of flow patterns showed
   remarkable differences. In most soils, water bypassed the soil matrix.
   In some soils, dye penetrated beyond 1 m depth, whereas in others it
   remained in the top 50 cm. Structured soils were more prone to produce
   bypass flow, deep dye penetration, and pulse splitting than
   nonstructured soils. The initial water content had a less pronounced
   effect in some soils and no effect in others.}},

Abstract = {{Causes of episodic stream acidification and acid-neutralizing capacity
   (ANC) declines were investigated in five streams on forested,
   unglaciated catchments on the northern Appalachian Plateau of
   Pennsylvania, during October 1988 to April 1990. Increased SO4
   concentrations during episodes were the primary cause of ANC declines on
   three of the streams. Episodes on the remaining two streams were
   dominated by base cation dilution and/or SO4 increases. Base cation
   dilution was most important in a stream with initially high preepisode
   ANC caused by seeps from limestone outcrops. Bedrock layers on this
   basin were dipping toward the channel, which promoted more rapid
   movement of low-ANC subsurface storm flow water to the channel. A stream
   with even higher preepisode ANC, but on a basin with geologic structure
   that shunted low-ANC subsurface storm flow away from the channel,
   exhibited only minor base cation dilution. Organic acidity contributed
   to ANC decreases on all five streams, although it was a minor source
   compared with SO4 and dilution. NO3 and Cl did not contribute to ANC
   decreases on any of the study streams. Aluminum increases acted to
   reduce episodic ANC declines especially in the more acidic streams.
   Episodic acidification on the northern Appalachian Plateau in
   Pennsylvania was similar to that found in mid-Atlantic streams where SO4
   increases play a dominant role, but unlike glaciated regions in the
   Northeast where NO3 can be important.}},

Abstract = {{Seismic and tracer test data can be combined to estimate the spatial
   patterns of aquifer properties. We present an algorithm that estimates
   the geometry of large-scale lithologic zones, the effective hydraulic
   conductivities and seismic velocities for these zones, and the effective
   small-scale dispersivity. The heart of this algorithm is our split
   inversion method, which extracts the geometry of lithologic zones from
   an estimated seismic velocity field. This method determines the zonation
   that best matches multiple types of data, such as seismic travel times
   and tracer concentrations. Although the current implementation of the
   algorithm uses only cross-well seismic travel times and tracer
   concentrations, the algorithm could incorporate other data types that
   are sensitive to changes in large-scale lithology. We demonstrate the
   approach for two synthetic sandy aquifers, one with interbedded clay
   lenses and another with interbedded silt and gravel lenses. These
   examples differ in the uniqueness of the relationship between seismic
   velocities and hydraulic conductivities. For these examples our
   algorithm successfully maps interwell heterogeneities and accurately
   estimates hydraulic and seismic parameters.}},

   periodically turned off, has been suggested as a means to enhance
   remediation. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of pulsed pumping
   and continuous pumping for the case of a Gaussian plume, subject to
   first-order mass transfer during transport, in an aquifer with no
   regional gradient and constant mass transfer rate coefficients. We
   developed a Laplace domain Green's function solution for concentrations
   during pumping periods and coupled it with an analytic solution for
   concentrations during resting periods. First, we used this model to
   provide a simple type curve that can be used to estimate the
   mobile-immobile phase mass transfer coefficients from field data.
   Second, the mass and concentration removal histories were determined
   during pulsed pumping and during continuous pumping. The continuous
   pumping rate removed the same volume of water over the duration of
   remediation. We investigated the effects of physical parameters such as
   the mass transfer rate coefficients, and engineering design parameters
   such as the length of resting periods. Under the conditions considered,
   our evaluation shows that (1) for equal volumes of water removed, pulsed
   pumping does not remove more contaminant mass than pumping continuously
   at an average rate; (2) if the duration of the resting period is too
   large, then pulsed pumping removes much less mass than continuous
   pumping at the average rate, and (3) if the pulsed and continuous
   pumping rates are the same, pulsed pumping will take longer than
   continuous pumping to clean up the aquifer, but will require
   significantly less time during which the pump operates.}},

Abstract = {{Density-induced advection of organic vapors has been demonstrated to be
   a significant transport process in granular porous media if the
   permeability is sufficiently high such that density-induced advection
   dominates over vapor diffusion. In the context of partially saturated
   fractured media, the presence of a network of open fractures may lead to
   rapid rates of density-induced advection of the vapors in the fractures,
   even though the matrix may have low permeability. To investigate the
   various factors which affect vapor migration in discretely fractured
   porous media, a two-dimensional finite element model has been developed
   whereby the porous matrix is represented by rectangular elements and the
   fractures are represented as one-dimensional line elements which are
   superimposed onto the rectangular grid. The cross-sectional model
   includes the processes of advection due to density and pressure
   gradients, and vapor and aqueous diffusion in both the fractures and the
   porous matrix. Phase partitioning between the vapor and aqueous phases
   and the aqueous and solid phases is assumed to be at equilibrium.
   Results from simulations involving a single vertical fracture indicate
   that density-induced advection decreases in importance as the fracture
   aperture decreases. In this case, there appears to be a critical
   fracture aperture, above which density-induced advection is the dominant
   process, and below which vapor diffusion dominates. Simulations that
   include a network of horizontal and vertical fractures show the
   importance of matrix properties such as air porosity and water content.
   An increase in the matrix air porosity results in a higher storage
   capacity for vapor-phase contaminants and allows more diffusion to occur
   from the fractures to the matrix, whereas a higher matrix water content
   results in an increase in the degree of phase partitioning between the
   vapor and the water phases. Although these two processes act to retard
   the migration of the vapor plume, they can be problematic in the context
   of vapor extraction in fractured porous media. The reason for this is
   that these processes tend to increase the amount of contaminant mass
   that exists in the low-permeability matrix. As a result, vapor
   extraction in fractured porous media can be very difficult.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, it is important to make the distinction between
   spreading and dilution of a plume in groundwater. Spreading is
   associated with the stretching and deformation of a contaminant plume,
   whereas dilution is associated with the increase in volume of the fluid
   occupied by the solute. The dilution and spreading of a Gaussian plume
   in a homogeneous porous medium with constant velocity are related in a
   simple fashion and are both characterized by the same parameters, the
   dispersion coefficients. However, the geological formations of interest
   in field applications are heterogeneous, and the plumes are irregular in
   shape. The dispersion coefficients that are deduced from tracer tests
   usually measure an overall rate at which a tracer plume spreads about
   its centroid and depend critically on the heterogeneity of the
   formation. These macroscopic dispersion coefficients are not reliable
   measures of the rate at which the maximum concentration is reduced
   because in heterogeneous formations the rates of dilution and spreading
   can be quite different. The main objective of this work is to introduce
   a new macroscopic measure of dilution, the dilution index E. Examples
   serve to demonstrate the usefulness of the measure. A general expression
   for the rate of dilution of a tracer plume is derived. The exact rate of
   increase of the dilution index under the idealized conditions of
   constant dispersion coefficients and a Gaussian plume is computed, and a
   lower bound is found to the same quantity for non-Gaussian plumes. For
   the general heterogeneous case the analysis demonstrates that the
   instantaneous rate of increase of In E is proportional to the
   small-scale dispersion coefficients, everything else being the same. The
   rate of increase of In E depends also on the degree of irregularity in
   the shape of the plume. Thus, in the long term, geologic heterogeneity
   should increase the rate of dilution because spatial variability in the
   flow velocity tends to deform plumes and make them less regular.}},

Abstract = {{Observation of scale-dependent dispersion and non-Gaussian concentration
   distributions under field-scale transport in heterogeneous media
   motivates investigation of alternatives to the classical Fickian
   diffusion model. A numerical model of non-Gaussian transport, employing
   a particle-tracking approach, is examined here. Non-Gaussian behavior is
   represented through modeling of the correlation between components of
   the random dispersive vector applied at each time step in the random
   walk particle-tracking algorithm. This model is applied to a number of
   highly detailed, synthetic hydraulic conductivity fields. By
   simultaneously modeling particle movement at two different scales, the
   impact of the small-scale heterogeneity on the correlation structure of
   the dispersive vectors at the larger scale can be observed directly. It
   is shown that accounting for the correlation structure of the dispersive
   vectors greatly improves prediction of arrival distributions
   (breakthrough curves) over the standard Fickian model. This improvement
   is especially evident when the model scale is not much larger than the
   correlation length of hydraulic conductivity but persists at relatively
   large transport distances. In particular, the non-Gaussian model is
   better able to represent the late arrival tail, which has important
   implications for the design and implementation of aquifer remediation
   methods. It is also shown that the apparent scale dependence of field
   dispersivity results at least in part from neglecting the correlation
   structure of local velocity perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{The predictions of two one-dimensional solute transport models
   describing area-averaged mean field concentrations under steady state
   water flow conditions were tested through numerical experiments. The two
   models are based on different solute dispersion process hypotheses,
   namely, the stochastic-convective process of the convective lognormal
   transfer function model and the advective-dispersive process of the
   advection-dispersion equation model. Two hypothetical random fields
   having different correlation structures for their hydraulic and
   retention properties were generated through a random scaling factor
   delta. The numerical experiments were conducted by running solute
   transport simulations in these hypothetical fields, and the simulation
   results were used to calibrate the two process models. The simulation
   results demonstrated that even under steady state, one-dimensional water
   flow in the medium having a short correlation length scale, considerable
   local variations in solute concentration were still present in the
   simulation results. The observed dispersion in the mean field data was
   intermediate between the representations in the two extreme process
   hypotheses of the two models tested, and neither model was accurate over
   the entire range of testing. Predictions of the asymptotic dispersivity
   based on the analysis used in saturated flow were not valid under
   unsaturated conditions. Complete knowledge of the velocity field was
   required in the latter case to predict the asymptotic dispersivity.}},

Abstract = {{Cumulative distribution functions (cdf) of groundwater model responses
   are generally determined using Monte Carlo analysis. The procedure
   consists of (1) generating a number of realizations of the parameters
   controlling groundwater flow, (2) solving the groundwater flow equation
   in each of the realizations to obtain the model responses, (3) ranking
   the model responses, and (4) assigning a probability to each model
   response as a function of its rank and the total number of realizations.
   When one is only interested in determining one of the tails of the cdf,
   e.g., to determine model responses with a small probability of being
   exceeded, it would be more appropriate to try to reverse steps 2 and 3
   above, so that the realizations are ranked first and then the
   groundwater flow equation is solved only for those realizations leading
   to responses in the tail of the cdf. Because the ranking of the
   realizations must be done in terms of their model responses, which calls
   for the solution of the groundwater flow equation, we propose to use a
   linear approximation of the flow equation to approximate the ranks. The
   proposal is based on the conjecture that first-order approximations are
   more robust for computing the ranks of the piezometric heads than for
   computing the heads themselves. The conjecture is demonstrated in two
   two-dimensional confined flow problems comparing the results of the
   approximation to the results of full Monte Carlo analyses on several
   sets of 200 realizations with varying standard deviations of log10 T.}},

Abstract = {{In general, stochastic partial differential equations and/or boundary
   conditions describing flow in phreatic aquifers are nonlinear. This
   paper uses second-order perturbation to approximate the response of a
   phreatic aquifer system subject to multiple random inputs. The approach
   is equivalent to assuming quadratic nonlinearities in the original
   nonlinear phreatic aquifer system. Using frequency domain
   representations, the resulting model is decomposed into linear and
   nonlinear (quadratic) frequency response functions (FRF). For Gaussian
   input, the response of a nonlinear phreatic aquifer system is
   non-Gaussian and is typically skewed. Thus the variance spectrum is
   insufficient to describe the response process. The bispectrum, defined
   as the Fourier transform of the third-order cumulant sequence,
   represents the distribution of skewness with frequency and further
   serves as a measure of the nonlinearity of the system. Given input
   processes of aquifer recharge and stream stage fluctuations, the linear
   and quadratic FRF are used to construct the spectrum and bispectrum of
   the response process. The role of nonlinearity in a stream-aquifer
   system is examined.}},

Abstract = {{The present work explores a class of analytical solutions of steady
   moisture movement in unsaturated porous media characterized by an
   exponential dependence of the hydraulic conductivity. The Green's
   function method is used to derive a general analytical model which can
   handle multidimensional steady infiltration problems in a semi-infinite
   medium with arbitrary boundary conditions and root uptake forcing
   functions and for various simple source geometries. The power of the
   Green's function method is such that a number of new problems were
   amenable to analysis and solutions to problems already solved were
   obtained in a form better suited for numerical computation. Of special
   importance is the capability of the analytical model to handle the
   difficult problem of mixed boundary conditions in an approximative
   fashion. The general solution is expressed in integral form from which
   particular analytical solutions pertaining to cases of surface and
   subsurface irrigation, root uptake, and isothermal evaporation can be
   easily deduced. New solutions include the case of surface sources under
   a prescribed exponential head and flux distribution, an inverse power
   flux distribution, and periodic root uptake. The inverse power flux
   distribution allows the approximate modeling of constant potential
   sources with evaporation at the nonwetted surfaces. It is shown that all
   two- and three-dimensional infiltration solutions are essentially
   integrals of two functions: one dependent on the geometry and
   distribution of the source and the other dependent on the boundary
   condition at the land surface. Near-field and far-field approximations
   have also been obtained and simple algebraic equations have been derived
   for the flux and potential beneath the centerline of the source. The
   proposed model offers the analyst significant flexibility in deriving
   results and analyzing infiltration phenomena of practical interest in
   civil and agricultural engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of areal mean precipitation intensity derived from rain gages
   are commonly used to assess the performance of rainfall radars and
   satellite rainfall retrieval algorithms. Areal mean precipitation time
   series collected during short-duration climate field studies are also
   used as inputs to water and energy balance models which simulate
   land-atmosphere interactions during the experiments. In two recent field
   experiments (1987 First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology
   Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) and the Multisensor Airborne
   Campaign for Hydrology 1990 (MAC-HYDRO `90)) designed to investigate the
   climatic signatures of land-surface forcings and to test airborne
   sensors, rain gages were placed over the watersheds of interest. These
   gages provide the sole means for estimating storm precipitation over
   these areas, and the gage densities present during these experiments
   indicate that there is a large uncertainty in estimating areal mean
   precipitation intensity for single storm events. Using a theoretical
   model of time- and area-averaged spacetime rainfall and a model rainfall
   generator, the error structure of areal mean precipitation intensity is
   studied for storms statistically similar to those observed in the FIFE
   and MAC-HYDRO field experiments. Comparisons of the error versus gage
   density trade-off curves to those calculated using the storm
   observations show that the rainfall simulator can provide good estimates
   of the expected measurement error given only the expected intensity,
   coefficient of variation, and rain cell diameter or correlation length
   scale, and that these errors can quickly become very large (in excess of
   20\%) for certain storms measured with a network whose size is below a
   `'critical'' gage density. Because the mean storm rainfall error is
   particularly sensitive to the correlation length, it is important that
   future field experiments include radar and/or dense rain gage networks
   capable of accurately characterizing the rainstorm spatial and temporal
   correlation structure.}},

   warm (El Nino) phase of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle,
   we found a strong relationship evident in four regions of the United
   States: the Gulf of Mexico, the Northeast, the North Central, and the
   Pacific Northwest. In this present study we have examined the same four
   regions for a relationship between streamflow and the cold (La Nina)
   phase of the Southern Oscillation (SO). Invariably, we found evidence of
   strong and consistent streamflow responses to La Nina events within the
   study regions. In each of the four regions, the strongest La Nina signal
   occurred at the same time of year as had the El Nino signal in their
   respective years. The sign of the seasonal streamflow anomaly associated
   with the La Nina events is the opposite of that associated with the El
   Nino events. This documents the existence of the biennial tendency
   related to the SO in the streamflow anomaly, which is expected, since La
   Nina/El Nino are opposite phases of the ENSO cycle. Finally, the
   relationships between streamflow and La Nina/El Nino were found to be
   statistically significant, based on the hypergeometric distribution. The
   results of this study demonstrate coherent, consistent, and significant
   midlatitude streamflow responses to the tropical SO phenomenon. This
   confirms the results of previous climatological studies that have
   examined the extratropical teleconnections from a hydrological and
   meteorological perspective.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and testing of the hypothesis that
   the long-term water balance is determined only by the local interaction
   of fluctuating water supply (precipitation) and demand (potential
   evapotranspiration), mediated by water storage in the soil. Adoption of
   this hypothesis, together with idealized representations of relevant
   input variabilities in time and space, yields a simple model of the
   water balance of a finite area having a uniform climate. The
   partitioning of average annual precipitation into evapotranspiration and
   runoff depends on seven dimensionless numbers: the ratio of average
   annual potential evapotranspiration to average annual precipitation
   (index of dryness); the ratio of the spatial average plant-available
   water-holding capacity of the soil to the annual average precipitation
   amount; the mean number of precipitation events per year; the shape
   parameter of the gamma distribution describing spatial variability of
   storage capacity; and simple measures of the seasonality of mean
   precipitation intensity, storm arrival rate, and potential
   evapotranspiration. The hypothesis is tested in an application of the
   model to the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, with no
   calibration. Study area averages of runoff and evapotranspiration, based
   on observations, are 263 mm and 728 mm, respectively; the model yields
   corresponding estimates of 250 mm and 741 mm, respectively, and explains
   88\% of the geographical variance of observed runoff within the study
   region. The differences between modeled and observed runoff can be
   explained by uncertainties in the model inputs and in the observed
   runoff. In the humid (index of dryness <1) parts of the study area, the
   dominant factor producing runoff is the excess of annual precipitation
   over annual potential evapotranspiration, but runoff caused by
   variability of supply and demand over time is also significant; in the
   arid (index of dryness >1) parts, all of the runoff is caused by
   variability of forcing over time. Contributions to model runoff
   attributable to small-scale spatial variability of storage capacity are
   insignificant throughout the study area. The consistency of the model
   with observational data is supportive of the supply-demand-storage
   hypothesis, which neglects infiltration excess runoff and other
   finite-permeability effects on the soil water balance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the hydroclimatic modeling of mountain front
   recharge to regional aquifers. An analytical relationship between the
   mean seasonal precipitation and runoff is obtained based on a
   conceptualization of the hydrologic processes occurring in hard rock
   mountainous terrain and a derived-distribution approach where the input
   variables are considered to be stochastic and their probability
   distributions are transformed into the probability distribution of the
   output variable by using the deterministic physical process. In a
   first-order approximation a relationship between the seasonal values of
   precipitation and runoff is obtained. An analytical model of the
   seasonal streamflow is then developed where initial abstraction and the
   long-term effective subsurface outflow, or mountain front recharge, are
   viewed as unknown model parameters. In addition, a procedure that
   combines the water balance equation with a relationship provided by the
   so-called `'vegetal equilibrium hypothesis,'' and which enables the
   estimation of effective soil-related parameters jointly with the mean
   seasonal evapotranspiration and surface runoff, is introduced. This
   procedure is applied to a mountainous watershed in southern Arizona.}},

Abstract = {{While the use of remote hydrometers for measuring the level in water
   courses is both economical and widespread, the same cannot be said for
   cross section and channel profile measurements and, even less, for
   rating curves at the measuring cross sections, all of which are more
   often than not incomplete, out of date, and unreliable. The mass of data
   involved in level measurements alone induces a degree of perplexity in
   those who try to use them, for example, for flood event simulations or
   the construction of forecasting models which are not purely statistical.
   This paper proposes a method which uses recorded level data alone to
   construct a simulation model and a forecasting model, both of them
   characterized by an extremely simple structure that can be used on any
   pocket calculator. These models, referring to a river reach bounded by
   two measuring sections, furnish the downstream levels, where the
   upstream levels are known, and the downstream level at time t +
   DELTAt{*}, where the upstream and downstream levels are known at time t,
   respectively. The numerical applications performed show that while the
   simulation model is somewhat penalized by the simplifications adopted,
   giving not consistently satisfactory results on validation, the
   forecasting model generated good results in all the cases examined and
   seems reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological time series are often asymmetric in time, insomuch as rises
   are more rapid than recessions, as well as having highly skewed marginal
   distributions. A two-stage transformation is proposed for deseasonalized
   series. Rises are stretched, and recessions are squashed until the
   series is symmetric over time. An autoregressive moving average (ARMA)
   model is then fitted to the natural logarithms of this new series. The
   residuals from the ARMA model are represented by a double mixture of
   Weibull and exponential distributions. The method is demonstrated with
   24 years of daily flows from the River Cherwell in the south of England,
   and a 40-year record from the upper reaches of the Thames. Seasonal
   estimates of flood risk are given, and these can be conditioned on
   catchment wetness at the time of prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric deposition provides most of the dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   (DIN) and total nitrogen in the annual nutrient load of Lake Tahoe.
   Deposition also contributes significant amounts of soluble reactive
   phosphorus (SRP) and total phosphorus loading but plays less of a role
   than in the case of nitrogen. Most of the DIN probably originates
   outside of the drainage basin in urban and agricultural areas to the
   south and west. Spatial patterns of SRP deposition differ from those of
   DIN and suggest a within-basin terrestrial source, such as leachate from
   windblown dust or other particles. Because of atmospheric N deposition,
   the N:P (molar) ratio in combined loading is well above the Redfield
   ratio of 16 and consistent with an observed shift from colimitation by N
   and P to persistent P limitation in the lake phytoplankton.}},

Abstract = {{A complete reactive groundwater transport model must account for both
   chemical and transport processes. For the chemical processes one has to
   decide whether to formulate them kinetically or to assume a local
   chemical equilibrium state. This decision in the chemical model part
   determines the mathematical structure of the overall model. In a kinetic
   formulation, the linear partial differential equations of the transport
   have to be coupled with a nonlinear system of ordinary differential
   equations describing the kinetic development, whereas in an equilibrium
   formulation, the equations of the transport are coupled to a nonlinear
   system of algebraic equations describing the equilibrium state.
   Basically, two kinds of methods for solving reactive transport systems
   may be distinguished, namely, one-step methods which simultaneously
   solve the transport and the chemical model parts and two-step methods
   which solve these model parts separately. We here present a sequential
   two-step method for kinetic transport models and an iterative two-step
   method for equilibrium transport models. We conduct a timescale analysis
   to check whether the error of the sequential two-step method is
   tolerable and whether a given kinetic transport system can be reduced to
   an equilibrium one. The numerical methods and the timescale analysis are
   applied to two test cases. Zysset et al. (1994) present a further
   application of the kinetic transport model to laboratory column
   experiments governed by biodegradation.}},

Abstract = {{The relative size and roughness of a stable armor varies with particle
   shape. For a given imposed shear stress the order of increasing nominal
   particle diameter is flat, angular, and rounded gravel. The order of
   increasing surface roughness is flat, rounded, and angular gravel. The
   mobility of fine flat gravel particles is enhanced by the lower surface
   roughness of armors which exhibit an imbricated structure. However, the
   generally lower mobility of ellipsoids means that, for a given stream
   power, bed load discharge associated with armor development on flat
   gravel is less than that for rounded gravel (at greater depth to grain
   size ratios). The larger projected area of angular gravel enhances the
   mobility of coarse grains at high flows, offsetting interlocking effects
   which restrict the mobility of angular gravel at low flows. Relative and
   absolute size effects contribute to the departure from equal mobility of
   coarse and fine particles that is a ubiquitous feature of stable armor
   development below the limit for the formation of a threshold armor when
   all particles are equally mobile. The transport of fine sediment as
   throughput load may mask the effect due to hiding in the field and give
   the erroneous appearance that stable armors develop solely through
   winnowing. All particle sizes in the underlying bed material are present
   in the armor and in the bed load, and coarsening is but one of several
   adjustments to the surficial bed material that occur as a stable armor
   evolves. It likely involves the wholesale rearrangement of surficial
   particles and may entail minimization of shear due to drag on background
   roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Marginal bed load transport describes the condition when relatively few
   bed particles are moving at any time. Bed particles resting in the
   shallowest bed pockets will move when the dimensionless shear stress
   tau{*} exceeds a value of about 0.020. As tau{*} increases, the number
   of bed particles moving increases. Significant motion of bed particles,
   i.e., when a substantial fraction of the bed particles are moving,
   occurs when tau{*} exceeds a value of about 0.060. Thus marginal bed
   load transport occurs over the domain 0.020 < tau{*} < 0.060. Marginal
   bed load transport rates and associated hydraulic characteristics of
   Sagehen Creek, a small mountain gravel bed stream, were measured on 55
   days at discharges ranging from slightly less than one half of the
   bank-full discharge to more than 4 times the bank-full discharge.
   Dimensionless shear stress varied from 0.032 to 0.042, and bed particles
   as large as the 80th percentile of the bed surface were transported. The
   relation between reference dimensionless shear stress and relative
   particle protrusion for Sagehen Creek was determined by varying
   tau(ri){*} to obtain the best fit of the Parker bed load function to the
   measured transport rates. During the period of record (water years
   1954-4991), the mean annual quantity of bed load transported past the
   Sagehen Creek gage was 24.7 tons. Forty-seven percent of all bed load
   transported during the 38 years of record occurred in just 6 years.
   During 10 of the 38 years of record, essentially no bed load was
   transported. The median diameter of bed load was 26 mm, compared to 58
   mm in the surface bed material.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model has been developed for the routing of gravel-sized
   sediment along a river channel which is free to adjust both its long
   profile and surface texture. Hydraulic calculations use a step-backwater
   approach, and sediment transport is predicted with the method of Parker
   (1990a), which uses a low degree of size selectivity. Exchange of
   sediment between the surface and subsurface is described using the
   modified Exner equation of Parker and Sutherland (1990). The model is
   applied to an idealized channel based on the highly concave Allt
   Dubhaig, Scotland, in which fining by particle wear is minor. The rapid
   downstream fining observed in this river is closely matched by model
   predictions after a time equivalent to < 10(2) years under the present
   flow regime of the river. The evolution of the fining pattern during the
   model run and associated changes in sediment transport and bed
   aggradation are described. It is concluded that strong profile concavity
   can force rapid downstream fining even though bed load transport is only
   slightly size selective. This run of the model serves as a basis for
   testing of the sensitivity of downstream fining to alternative choices
   of parameter values and boundary conditions, which are summarized here
   and will be described in a subsequent paper.}},

Abstract = {{A drainage basin simulation model introduced here incorporates creep and
   threshold slumping and both detachment- and transport-limited fluvial
   processes. Fluvial erosion of natural slopes and headwater channels is
   argued to be dominantly detachment-limited. Such slopes undergo nearly
   parallel retreat and replacement with alluvial surfaces under fixed base
   level, in contrast with gradual slope decline for transport-limited
   conditions. The arrangement of divides and valleys is sensitive to
   initial conditions, although average morphology is insensitive.
   Dissected, initially flat surfaces in which downstream concavity is
   slight exhibit nearly parallel drainage, compared to very wandering main
   valleys when concavity is great. Steady state is reached after a
   cumulative base level drop approximately 3 times the final relief.
   Simulated valley systems are similar to those predicted by a previous
   model of optimal drainage basins. A critical value of slope divergence
   normalized by average slope gradient is a useful criterion for defining
   the valley network.}},

Abstract = {{A finite element model simulating runoff and soil erosion from
   agricultural lands is developed. The computational efficiency and
   stability of various numerical schemes used for time integration are
   critically examined employing L2 and Chebycheff (Chebyshev) norms.
   Predictor-corrector and fully implicit schemes are found to give the
   least values of norms, thereby permitting larger time steps. A finite
   element solution of the one-dimensional Richards equation with a sink
   term simulates rain infiltration and soil moisture balance in cropped
   fields. A criterion to ensure stability and convergence of the solution
   is suggested. A finite element solution of the sediment continuity
   equation in conjunction with a fully implicit scheme for time
   integration and Yalin's equation for sediment transport capacity is
   developed to simulate soil erosion. The potential of the model to
   reasonably simulate runoff and soil erosion is demonstrated by comparing
   the finite element solutions with the analytical solutions under
   simplified configurations and with experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The finite element model for simulation of runoff and soil erosion as
   developed by Sharda and Singh (this issue) is evaluated using data
   collected from agricultural land treated with major mechanical soil and
   water conservation measures, namely, contour bunding, graded bunding,
   bench terracing, and conservation bench terracing. The simulated and
   experimentally realized hydrographs and soil loss values are in
   reasonably good agreement for various measures. Probable reasons for
   discrepancies between the predicted and observed values are discussed.
   The model has the potential of being used on a single storm or a
   continuous basis provided the soil, crop, and climatic parameters are
   precisely known or estimated for a given location and for the period
   under consideration. The model logically simulates the effects of flow,
   topographic, soil, and crop parameters such as antecedent moisture
   level, roughness coefficient, saturated hydraulic conductivity, slope,
   depth of impoundment, size of outlet, longitudinal slope of the channel,
   vertical interval, and cropping management factor. The model is found to
   be quite sensitive to changes in roughness coefficient, rainfall excess
   rate, and cover management factor, and hence these parameters need to be
   assessed carefully in the field. The general applicability of the model
   as a planning tool for soil conservation measures and the scope for
   future development are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Since the introduction of the geomorphological instantaneous unit
   hydrograph (GIUH) by Rodriguez-Iturbe and Valdes (1979) there have been
   a number of different approaches to expressing the geomorphology of a
   catchment for determining the hydrological response of the catchment. We
   examine three approaches by which geomorphology can be introduced
   through the probabilities and lengths of the pathways available within a
   network: (1) using the Horton order ratios to derive analytical
   expressions for these pathway parameters, (2) extracting these
   probabilities and lengths directly from a Strahler ordered network
   without using the Horton order ratios, and (3) using a contributing
   area-flow distance function extracted directly from the digital
   elevation model (DEM) of a catchment without the assumptions of Strahler
   stream ordering. We use these techniques to derive the GIUH and the
   geomorphological dispersion coefficient as defined by Rinaldo et al.
   (1991) for two catchments in the southwestern region of Australia. The
   geomorphological dispersion coefficient derived from the area-distance
   function expresses the natural dispersion within the catchment in a more
   fundamental manner than the other methods, and the GIUHs derived from
   this function exhibit an underlying dispersion of an order of magnitude
   greater than either of the approaches based on Strahler ordering. We
   look at the concept of the `'completeness'' of a network from which we
   derive catchment parameters and how this concept is related to the
   threshold area supporting a network derived from a catchment DEM.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a two-parameter (beta0 and beta1) Gibbsian probability
   model to characterize the spatial behavior of channel networks. This
   model is defined for trees draining basins on a square lattice. The
   probability of a tree s is proportional to exp {[}-beta0H(s, beta1)],
   where H(s, beta1) is taken to be a summation over lattice points upsilon
   in the basin of A(upsilon, s)beta1, letting A(upsilon, s) be the area
   upstream from (but not including) point upsilon. Procedures are
   developed for estimating the parameters given an actual network
   obtained, for example, from digital elevation data and for using
   bootstrapping to obtain confidence intervals for these estimates. We
   also develop several goodness of fit tests for the model. These
   procedures are applied to a set of data for 50 subnetworks from Willow
   Creek in Montana. The estimation algorithm converged successfully for 34
   of these subnetworks. For these 34 subnetworks the two-parameter model
   gives in most cases a fit significantly better than a one-parameter
   model (with beta1 constrained to be 1) studied in a previous paper.
   There is still, however, statistically significant lack of fit for as
   many as 13 subnetworks (depending on which test is applied). The
   parameter beta1 averages 0.75 for the 34 subnetworks. The function H(s,
   beta1) in the Gibbsian model may be given a statistical mechanical
   interpretation of `'energy'' associated with a configuration s. Other
   researchers have employed a similar definition of energy expenditure in
   drainage systems but have given physical arguments that the exponent
   beta1 should be 0.50. We finally discuss the idea of defining `'optimal
   channel networks'' as those which minimize free energy in the Gibbsian
   model; it is shown that minimization of energy (rather than free energy)
   as other researchers have proposed is valid only under the assumption of
   a `'low temperature'' (i.e., large beta0) system. Our results indicate
   that this assumption would not be justified for Willow Creek. We devote
   some discussion to the discrepancies between our approach and results
   and those of other researchers.}},

   CATCHMENTS}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the question of similarity of runoff generation
   processes between catchments in the eastern wheat belt of Western
   Australia, and the use of dimensionless parameterizations to quantify
   this similarity. A spatially distributed rainfall-runoff model,
   simulating runoff generation by both the infiltration excess (Horton
   type) and saturation excess (Dunne type) mechanisms, was developed for
   catchments in the region. Seven small experimental catchments, with
   field-measured soil hydraulic properties and topography, were used in
   the study. Following on from the similarity theory developed by
   Sivapalan et al. (1987), a number of dimensionless similarity parameters
   were constructed using the field-measured soil and topographic
   properties, a characteristic length scale, and a characteristic flow
   velocity. The objective was to determine whether the dominant runoff
   generation mechanism on a catchment could be reliably predicted by these
   similarity parameters. This was achieved through sensitivity analyses
   carried out with the rainfall-runoff model. Two dimensionless
   parameters, K0{*} and f{*}, were found to be critical for characterizing
   the similarity or dissimilarity of the runoff generation responses
   between the seven experimental catchments. Within the assumptions of the
   analysis, two catchments in the wheat belt region can be considered to
   be hydrologically similar, in terms of their runoff responses, if K0{*}
   and f{*} are identical in both catchments. The dominant mechanism of
   runoff generation on any catchment can be reliably predicted, provided
   that the values of K0{*} and f{*} are known. A partial quantification of
   the Dunne diagram (Dunne, 1978) for the wheat belt region, in terms of
   the infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanisms, was achieved
   by artificially varying K0{*} and f{*} in the rainfall-runoff model to
   explore the full range of possible runoff generation responses.}},

Abstract = {{Historical and paleoflood data have become an important source of
   information for flood frequency analysis. A number of studies have been
   proposed in the literature regarding the value of historical and
   paleoflood information for estimating flood quantiles. These studies
   have been generally based on computer simulation experiments. In this
   paper the value of using systematic and historical/paleoflood data
   relative to using systematic records alone is examined analytically by
   comparing the asymptotic variances of flood quantiles assuming a
   two-parameter general extreme value marginal distribution, type 1 and
   type 2 censored data, and maximum likelihood estimation method. The
   results of this study indicate that the value of historical and
   paleoflood data for estimating flood quantiles can be small or large
   depending on only three factors: the relative magnitudes of the length
   of the systematic record (N) and the length of the historical period
   (M); the return period (7) of the flood quantile of interest; and the
   return period (H) of the threshold level of perception. For instance,
   for N = 50, M = 50 and T = 500, the statistical gain for type 2
   censoring becomes significantly larger than for type 1 censoring as H
   becomes greater than 100 years. In addition, computer experiments have
   shown that the results regarding the statistical gain based on
   asymptotic considerations are valid for the usual sample sizes.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed hydrology-vegetation model is described that includes
   canopy interception, evaporation, transpiration, and snow accumulation
   and melt, as well as runoff generation via the saturation excess
   mechanisms. Digital elevation data are used to model topographic
   controls on incoming solar radiation, air temperature, precipitation,
   and downslope water movement. Canopy evapotranspiration is represented
   via a two-layer Penman-Monteith formulation that incorporates local net
   solar radiation, surface meteorology, soil characteristics and moisture
   status, and species-dependent leaf area index and stomatal resistance.
   Snow accumulation and ablation are modeled using an energy balance
   approach that includes the effects of local topography and vegetation
   cover. Saturated subsurface flow is modeled using a quasi
   three-dimensional routing scheme. The model was applied at a 180-m scale
   to the Middle Fork Flathead River basin in northwestern Montana. This
   2900-km2, snowmelt-dominated watershed ranges in elevation from 900 to
   over 3000 m. The model was calibrated using 2 years of recorded
   precipitation and streamflow. The model was verified against 2
   additional years of runoff and against advanced very high resolution
   radiometer based spatial snow cover data at the 1-kM2 scale. Simulated
   discharge showed acceptable agreement with observations. The simulated
   areal patterns of snow cover were in general agreement with the remote
   sensing observations, but were lagged slightly in time.}},

Abstract = {{Current algorithms for computing contributing areas from a rectangular
   grid digital elevation model (DEM) use the flow-routing model of
   O'Callaghan and Mark (1984), which has two major restrictions: (1) flow
   which originates over a two-dimensional pixel is treated as a point
   source (nondimensional) and is projected downslope by a line (one
   dimensional) (Moore and Grayson, 1991), and (2) the flow direction in
   each pixel is restricted to eight possibilities. We show that large
   errors in the computed contributing areas result for any terrain
   topography: divergent, convergent, or planar. We present a new model,
   called digital elevation model networks (DEMON), which avoids the above
   problems by representing flow in two dimensions and directed by aspect.
   DEMON allows computation of both contributing and dispersal areas. DEMON
   offers the main advantage of contour-based models (e.g., Moore et al.,
   1988), the representation of varying flow width over nonplanar
   topography, while having the convenience of using rectangular grid DEMs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a direct comparison of apparent ages derived from
   H-3/He-3, chlorofluorocarbons (CCl3F and CCl2F2), and Kr-85 measurements
   in shallow groundwater. Wells chosen for this study are completed in the
   unconfined surficial aquifers in late Cenozoic Atlantic Coastal Plain
   sediments of the Delmarva Peninsula, on the east coast of the United
   States. Most of the apparent tracer ages agree within 2 years of each
   other for recharge dates between 1965 and 1990. Discrepancies in
   apparent tracer ages usually can be explained by hydrological processes
   such as mixing in a discharge area. Recharge rate calculations based on
   apparent tracer age gradients at multilevel well locations agree with
   previous recharge estimates. High recharge rates on the Delmarva
   Peninsula result in nearly complete dissolved-gas confinement in the
   groundwater. The remarkable agreement between the different tracer ages
   indicates negligible mixing of waters of different ages, insignificant
   dispersion, minimal gas loss to the atmosphere, and insignificant
   sorption-desorption processes at this location.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present seven unsaturated zone profiles of Cl-36 and
   three H-3 profiles from southern Australia. All profiles show single
   peaks corresponding to high radionuclide fallout from nuclear testing in
   the 1950s and 1960s. The profiles are used to estimate rates of water
   movement leading to recharge of the groundwater. Among these profiles is
   the first profile on which high concentrations of Cl-36 have been found
   below a 2-m depth. In this profile, H-3 and Cl-36 peaks coincide. In six
   of the seven profiles, total Cl-36 fallout was found to be between 1.2
   and 2.4 x 10(12) atoms m-2, and is of similar magnitude to that found at
   similar latitudes in the northern hemisphere. Comparisons of soil water
   fluxes estimated with H-2, Cl-36, and chloride are briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{One way to estimate the hydrologic properties of heterogeneous geologic
   media is to invert well test data using multiple observation wells.
   Pressure transients observed during a well test are compared to the
   corresponding values obtained by numerically simulating the test using a
   mathematical model. The parameters of the mathematical model are varied
   and the simulation repeated until a satisfactory match to the observed
   pressure transients is obtained, at which point the model parameters are
   accepted as providing a possible representation of the hydrologic
   property distribution. Restricting the search to parameters that
   represent self-similar (fractal) hydrologic property distributions can
   improve the inversion process. Far fewer parameters are needed to
   describe a hierarchical medium, improving the efficiency and robustness
   of the inversion. Additionally, each parameter set produces a hydrologic
   property distribution with a hierarchical structure, which mimics the
   multiple scales of heterogeneity often seen in natural geological media.
   The parameters varied during the inversion create fractal sets known as
   attractors, using an iterated function system (IFS). An attractor is
   mapped to a distribution of transmissivity and storativity in the
   mathematical model. Thus the IFS inverse method searches for the
   parameters of the IFS (typically tens of parameters) rather than the
   values of the hydrologic property distribution directly (typically
   hundreds to thousands of parameters). Application of the IFS inverse
   method to synthetic data shows that the method works well for simple
   heterogeneities. Application to field data from a sand/clay sedimentary
   sequence and a fractured granite produces reasonable results.}},

Abstract = {{On March 13, 1991, construction of the entrance tunnel to the Aspo Hard
   Rock Laboratory opened a vertical fracture zone at a depth of 70 m. This
   provides an opportunity to study geochemical changes resulting from
   shallow water inflow into a crystalline bedrock aquifer as anticipated
   during construction and operation of a deep repository for spent nuclear
   fuel. Chloride ion is a natural conservative tracer for mixing between
   the dilute ({[}Cl-] < 10 mg L-1) shallow groundwater and the saline
   ({[}Cl-] = 5000 mg L-1) native groundwater of the fracture zone. A sharp
   dilution front, corresponding to 80\% dilution of the native
   groundwater, indicated arrival of shallow groundwater in the entrance
   tunnel after 3 weeks. In spite of this large input of shallow water, the
   fracture zone remains predominantly anoxic. Major element hydrochemistry
   and carbon and oxygen stable isotope data indicate large inputs of
   alkalinity and biogenic CO2(g). Input of organic carbon with shallow
   groundwater provides a possible energy and carbon source for anaerobic
   respiration. There is no evidence for sulfate reduction, and Fe(III)
   oxyhydroxide fracture minerals are the only other dominant electron
   acceptor observed.}},

Abstract = {{Models of solute transport in fractured geologic media that are based on
   the discrete network approach require that a method be adopted for
   transferring mass through each fracture intersection. The two usual
   models for mass partitioning between the outflow branches of crossing
   fractures assume either stream tube routing or complete mixing. A
   mathematical analysis of two-dimensional, laminar flow through the
   intersection of two orthogonal fractures with smooth walls is carried
   out to examine the mixing process. Mixing ratios are expressed in terms
   of a local Peclet number (Pe = vr/D), where v is an average fluid
   velocity within the fracture intersection, r is the radius of the
   fracture intersection, and D is the diffusion coefficient. As a general
   observation the concept of complete mixing within a fracture
   intersection does not properly represent the mass transfer process at
   any value of the Peclet number. A mixing ratio equivalent to complete
   mixing may be observed, but only for particular flow geometries and in a
   limited range of the Peclet number. Stream tube routing models provide a
   good approximation for Peclet numbers greater than 1; and in some cases
   this limit may be as low as 10(-2). The actual value of the lower limit
   depends upon the geometry of the bounding streamline that separates the
   flow into the two outflow fractures, in relation to the fracture through
   which solute enters the intersection. There is a range in the Peclet
   number, of roughly 3 orders of magnitude, where the extent of mixing is
   dependent upon the value of Pe within the intersection.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration variance, i.e., mean squared concentration
   fluctuations, undergoes mean advection, a local dispersive flux, and a
   macrodispersive flux due to a correlation between squared concentration
   perturbations and velocity perturbations. The products of the
   macrodispersion coefficient and the squared gradient of the mean
   concentration field determine the rate of production of concentration
   variance. The rate of dissipation of concentration variance is
   determined by the product of the local dispersion coefficient and the
   mean squared gradient of the concentration perturbation field. Variance
   dissipation is represented as a first-order decay with the decay
   coefficient equal to twice the sum of the local dispersion coefficient
   divided by the squared concentration microscale. The concentration
   microscale, estimated for an advection-dominated log hydraulic
   conductivity microscale, is an increasing function of the log
   conductivity microscale. Thus the larger the log conductivity microscale
   is, the slower is the rate of dissipation of concentration fluctuations
   by local dispersion and vice versa. The wave number squared dependence
   of fluctuation dissipation requires intensive sampling to realistically
   model the log conductivity spectrum and its microscale, which determines
   the rate of dissipation of concentration fluctuations by the action of
   local dispersion. There is no mechanism of destroying concentration
   fluctuations without the action of local dispersion.}},

Abstract = {{For a multidimensional finite-size impulse input, analytical solutions
   to the conservation equation for concentration variance sigma(c)2 are
   presented. Due to the dissipating action of local dispersion, at large
   times, sigma(c) is a decreasing fraction of the mean concentration. The
   Cape Cod bromide tracer exhibits this decrease. The larger the log
   conductivity microscale is, the slower is the action of local
   dispersion, and the slower is the predicted rate of decrease of the
   ratio of sigma(c), and the mean concentration (i.e., the coefficient of
   variation) with time, at large times, and vice versa. The coefficient of
   variation increases with distance from the center. A balance between the
   rates of production and dissipation of sigma(c)2 relates it linearly to
   the squared gradients of the mean concentration field, away from the
   center of mass. For the zero local dispersion case, sigma(c) is an
   unboundedly growing multiple with time of the mean concentration. The
   longitudinal spatial second moment and macrodispersivities are
   insensitive to the inclusion/exclusion of local dispersion and therefore
   do not differentiate between the concentration fields for the two
   different cases. In contrast, the spatial-temporal evolution of
   sigma(c)2 is singularly determined by the dissipating action of local
   dispersion. Measurements of local dispersivities need to be made along
   with a characterization of hydraulic conductivity variations to assess
   contaminant concentrations in aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of solutes in groundwater is decisively influenced by the
   heterogeneity of the aquifer. The goal of the present work is the
   numerical generation of synthetic heterogeneous aquifer models based on
   a statistical description of heterogeneities in gravel aquifers. Large
   unweathered outcrops in several gravel pits in northeastern Switzerland
   were investigated in this context. On the basis of sedimentological
   observations it was possible to specify distinct sedimentary structures
   appearing as lenses or layers. All structures have been identified in
   each of the investigated outcrops. By inspecting and analyzing
   photographs of the outcrops, it was possible to estimate the probability
   density functions (pdf) of the geometrical attributes of the sedimentary
   structures. Disturbed and undisturbed samples were taken from these
   structures to estimate the pdf of their hydraulic properties, that is,
   the hydraulic conductivity and the porosity. The information obtained is
   used to generate distinct numerical realizations by unconditional
   stochastic simulation of synthetic aquifers having the same statistical
   properties with respect to hydraulic conductivity and porosity as the
   investigated deposits.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical information on the coherent sedimentary structures of highly
   heterogeneous gravel deposits (Jussel et al., this issue) is used to
   investigate numerically the transport of conservative tracers. The data
   are the basis for a numerical generation of synthetic aquifer models,
   whose statistical distributions of the sedimentary structures and their
   hydraulic conductivity and porosity correspond to the findings in the
   investigated deposits. A three-dimensional finite element flow model and
   a corresponding random-walk transport model were developed for this
   purpose. Because of the large number of finite elements needed, the
   solution algorithm is optimized for applications on vector-type
   computers. In order to minimize the discretization errors a special
   interpolation technique is applied to the determination of the local
   velocity vector. Ten stochastic, numerical transport experiments over a
   transport distance of 100 m were carried out with synthetic gravel
   aquifer models. They allow the mean tracer velocity, the effective
   hydraulic conductivity, and the dispersion parameters to be estimated.
   These estimates are compared with estimates of these parameters from
   current theories for the flow and the tracer transport in random,
   correlated, anisotropic hydraulic conductivity fields.}},

   system with two hydraulic layers with a ratio of conductivities of 1:13.
   A solution containing dissolved quinoline was injected as a front at one
   end of the system, and the aqueous-phase concentrations of quinoline,
   its first degradation product (2-hydroxyquinoline), and oxygen were
   monitored over time at several spatial locations. Results from a set of
   ancillary batch and small-column experiments were used to generate a
   mathematical model for the microbial kinetics; these kinetics described
   the time rate of change of the concentrations of the two organic
   compounds (quinoline and 2-hydroxyquinoline), the electron acceptor
   (oxygen), and microbial biomass. This independently developed kinetic
   model was incorporated into a two-dimensional numerical model for flow
   and transport, so that simulations of the laboratory system could be
   conducted and the results compared with observed data. An analysis of
   the applicability of single-phase and multiple-phase models for the
   description of the microbial kinetics was conducted. The results of this
   analysis indicated that for some cases, it is not necessary to
   explicitly model the mass transfer between the aqueous phase and the
   biomass phase. A single-phase model was used for simulating the
   laboratory system described here. Favorable comparisons between the
   laboratory and simulation data suggested that a single-phase model was
   appropriate for describing the microbially mediated reactions in this
   system. A method for incorporating the effects of metabolic lag into
   microbial kinetics is described. Metabolic lag was explicitly accounted
   for in the degradation kinetics for this system; the inclusion of
   metabolic lag proved to be important for describing transient
   concentration pulses that were observed in the low-conductivity layer.}},

Abstract = {{Steady seepage through a levee or a dam separating reservoirs with
   different levels and densities is shown to result in five possible flow
   configurations. If densities are equal, the problem reduces to the
   classical problem of flow through a dam. If the lower reservoir is less
   dense, a stationary wedge may or may not form inside the levee near the
   downgradient reservoir level. If the lower reservoir is more dense, a
   wedge forms near the toe of the levee, as in the classical problem of
   saltwater intrusion. Another possibility is that the dense wedge can
   connect the two reservoirs, thus allowing bidirectional flow. Conditions
   are derived which define when these different flow configurations occur.
   For the case of a rectangular dam with vertical walls a closed form
   solution is obtained for the net mass flux between the reservoirs. Net
   volumetric flux is determined analytically for all flow configurations
   except the case of bidirectional flow. The expression for volumetric
   flux is a generalization of a result based on the Dupuit assumption for
   the case of constant density. A range of parameters is identified in
   which net volumetric flux is in one direction and net mass flux in the
   other. A numerical model based on the boundary integral equation method
   allows calculation of net volumetric flux for the case of bidirectional
   flow and also allows simulation of more complex levee geometries. The
   solution has direct application to levees separating ponds in solar salt
   production, to the causeway across the Great Salt Lake in Utah, and to
   the role of exchange flows in the genesis of evaporites in nearshore
   lagoons.}},

Abstract = {{Properties of the effective conductivity tensor K(eff) are studied by
   deriving the second-order terms in its expansion in the variance sigma2
   of normally distributed log conductivity. It is shown that for media of
   anisotropic structure, the components of the effective conductivity
   tensor are expressed by a functional of the log conductivity covariance;
   that is, it depends on the shape of the correlation function and not
   only on anisotropy ratios, variance sigma2 and space dimensions.
   However, the trace of K(eff) is independent of the log conductivity
   autocovariance, and for a given mean conductivity depends only on sigma2
   The dependence of the effective conductivity on the correlation
   structure is illustrated for Gaussian and exponential autocovariances of
   log conductivity and for two- and three-dimensional flows.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing block water pricing, water transfer, and wildlife refuge

   Act are analyzed in terms of likely farmer response and economic
   efficiency of these provisions. Based on a simplified partial
   equilibrium analysis, we estimate small, but significant water
   conservation savings due to pricing reform, the potential for
   substantial water transfers to non-CVP customers in severe drought years
   when the water price exceeds \$110 per acre foot (1 acre foot equals
   1.234 x 10(3) m3) and positive net benefits for implementation of the
   wildlife refuge water supply provisions. The high threshold water price
   is partly a result of requiring farmers to pay full cost on transferred
   water plus a surcharge of \$25 per acre foot if the water is transferred
   to a non-CVP user. The act also sets an important precedent for water
   pricing reform, water transfer provisions, and environmental surcharges

   externalities which imply a divergence between competitive and socially

   in many aquifers, depletion will occur prematurely. Given these
   observations, serious questions arise concerning the role and scope of
   water management policy. We further explore this issue under alternative
   hydrologic/economic hypotheses and note scenarios under which divergence
   of competitive and socially optimal rates of water pumping is
   significant. We find that divergence increases with demand growth,
   declining well yields, and low social discount rates. The role and scope

Abstract = {{A new approach to groundwater quantity (hydraulic) management, based on
   a multicriterion decision aid methodology, is presented. The method
   couples a hydrodynamic groundwater flow simulation model with the
   decision aid one. It takes into account multiple criteria used by the
   decision maker (DM) in evaluating a management scenario as well as the
   hydrodynamic behavior of the groundwater system. The finite element and
   embedding methods are used to integrate the groundwater flow model into
   a multiobjective linear programming (LP) problem. Constraints on head,
   pumping rates, hydraulic gradient and velocity vector may be included in
   the management model. The piecewise linear utility function is assessed
   for modeling the DM's preferences. The best compromise solution is
   determined from the continuous Pareto set by solving a piecewise LP
   problem. User friendly software was developed to realize this
   methodology which is able to treat real scale problems. An illustrative
   example of an unconfined aquifer management is presented. Nonlinearities
   resulting from functional dependence of aquifer parameters on hydraulic
   head are handled iteratively.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater simulation models have been incorporated into a genetic
   algorithm to solve three groundwater management problems: maximum
   pumping from an aquifer; minimum cost water supply development; and
   minimum cost aquifer remediation. The results show that genetic
   algorithms can effectively and efficiently be used to obtain globally
   (or, at least near globally) optimal solutions to these groundwater
   management problems. The formulation of the method is straightforward
   and provides solutions which are as good as or better than those
   obtained by linear and nonlinear programming. Constraints can be
   incorporated into the formulation and do not require derivatives with
   respect to decision variables as in nonlinear programming. More
   complicated problems, such as transient pumping and multiphase
   remediation, can be formulated and solved using this method. The
   computational time required for the solution of genetic algorithm
   groundwater management models increases with the complexity of the
   problem. The speedup attainable by solving genetic algorithm problems on
   massively parallel computers is significant for problems where the
   simulation time required to complete each generation is high.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory observations of the saltation of natural gravel particles in
   a steep, movable-bed channel are reported. Standard video-imaging
   techniques were used to measure and analyze particle motion. The
   saltation of gravel particles is described in terms of statistical
   properties of particle trajectories, such as mean values and standard
   deviations of saltation length, height, and streamwise particle
   velocity. The results obtained are compared with available empirical
   data, and a general good agreement is obtained. Particle collision with
   the bed is also analyzed, and friction and restitution coefficients are
   estimated from the experimental observations. Nonvanishing values of the
   restitution coefficient and values of the friction coefficient lower
   than unity are obtained, which contradicts previous discussions on the
   subject. The dynamic friction coefficient associated with particle
   motion is also estimated from the experimental data, and a,mean value of
   0.3 is obtained, which is about half of that proposed by Bagnold (1973)
   but similar to those found in previous experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A Lagrangian model for the motion of a sediment particle in a water flow
   is proposed. The particle motion equation is averaged over flow
   turbulence, specialized to the case of coarse sediment particles
   saltating in water, and coupled with a stochastic model for particle
   collision with the bed. Model predictions of statistics of gravel
   saltation generally agree well with experimental observations. As an
   application of the saltation model, bed load transport rates are
   estimated from modeled mean saltation streamwise velocity and a dynamic
   friction coefficient. The results obtained compare favorably with
   typical bed load equations, but they overestimate experimental
   measurements of gravel transport, which would suggest that a Bagnoldean
   formulation for bed load transport of coarse material by saltating
   particles may not be valid.}},

Abstract = {{Field surveys of road drainage concentration at three sites in the
   western United States are used to test simple models relating channel
   initiation and shallow landsliding to ground slope and contributing area
   thresholds. The form of boundaries between data for locations where road
   drainage concentration is associated with either shallow landsliding,
   channel initiation by overland flow, or no observable geomorphic effect
   is consistent with theoretically derived drainage area-slope relations.
   Comparison of survey data with results of previous studies in these
   areas indicates that the drainage area required to support a channel
   head is smaller for road-related runoff than for undisturbed slopes.
   Contrary to current land management paradigms in the Pacific Northwest,
   drainage concentration from ridgetop roads may cause both landsliding
   and integration of the channel and road networks. Road drainage
   concentration increases the effective length of the channel network and
   strongly influences the distribution of erosional processes in each of
   the study areas. The approach of using field reconnaissance to establish
   thresholds for erosion associated with road drainage provides a useful
   method to define regional criteria for road design that should reduce
   impacts on downstream channel systems.}},

Abstract = {{Flood peak attenuation caused by storage of flood water on overbank
   surfaces effectively reduces the magnitude of peak discharges in some,
   but not all watersheds. Several geomorphic factors that affect the
   storage and conveyance of flood water were investigated to assess their
   quantitative influence on downstream peak discharges. The MIKE11
   rainfall-runoff and hydrodynamic models were calibrated for the Grant
   River watershed, southwestern Wisconsin. Alternative geomorphic
   conditions were modeled and compared to the original case. Results
   indicate that channel-floodplain-terrace morphology, valley width,
   stream slope, and hydraulic roughness each influence peak discharges,
   especially for moderate magnitude (5- to 50-year recurrence interval)
   floods. Peak discharges varied by as much as 49\% between simulations
   depending on geomorphic conditions. Watersheds that effectively
   attenuate produce peak discharges that are strongly correlated with
   total runoff. Watersheds that attenuate little produce peak discharges
   that exhibit greater variance due to storm intensity and duration.}},

Abstract = {{The Monsoon `90 multidisciplinary field campaign was conducted over the
   U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service Walnut
   Gulch experimental watershed in southeastern Arizona during
   June-September 1990. A primary objective of this combined ground,
   aircraft, and satellite campaign was to assess the feasibility of
   utilizing remotely sensed data coupled with water and energy balance
   modeling for large-area estimates of fluxes in semiarid rangelands. The
   experimental period encompassed a variety of vegetation, soil moisture,
   and rainfall conditions characterized by large temporal and spatial
   gradients. This preface outlines experimental objectives, briefly
   discusses the field campaigns, summarizes initial observations, and
   provides an overview of articles that are a part of the Monsoon `90

Abstract = {{A network of 9-m-tall surface flux measurement stations were deployed at
   eight sparsely vegetated sites during the Monsoon `90 experiment to
   measure net radiation, Q, soil heat flux, G, sensible heat flux, H
   (using eddy correlation), and latent heat flux, lambdaE (using the
   energy balance equation). At four of these sites, 2-m-tall eddy
   correlation systems were used to measure all four fluxes directly. Also
   a 2-m-tall Bowen ratio system was deployed at one site. Magnitudes of
   the energy balance closure (Q + G + H + lambdaE) increased as the
   complexity of terrain increased. The daytime Bowen ratio decreased from
   about 10 before the monsoon season to about 0.3 during the monsoons.
   Source areas of the measurements are developed and compared to scales of
   heterogeneity arising from the sparse vegetation and the topography.
   There was very good agreement among simultaneous measurements of Q with
   the same model sensor at different heights (representing different
   source areas), but poor agreement among different brands of sensors.
   Comparisons of simultaneous measurements of G suggest that because of
   the extremely small source area, extreme care in sensor deployment is
   necessary for accurate measurement in sparse canopies. A recently
   published model to estimate fetch is used to interpret measurements of H
   at the 2 m and 9 m heights. Three sites were characterized by undulating
   topography, with ridgetops separated by about 200-600 m. At these sites,
   sensors were located on ridgetops, and the 9-m fetch included the
   adjacent valley, whereas the 2-m fetch was limited to the immediate
   ridgetop and hillside. Before the monsoons began, vegetation was mostly
   dormant, the watershed was uniformly hot and dry, and the two
   measurements of H were in close agreement. After the monsoons began and
   vegetation fully matured, the 2-m measurements of H were significantly
   greater than the 9-m measurements, presumably because the vegetation in
   the valleys was denser and cooler than on the ridgetops and hillsides.
   At one lowland site with little topographic relief, the vegetation was
   more uniform, and the two measurements of H were in close agreement
   during peak vegetation. Values of lambdaE could only be compared at two
   sites, but the 9-m values were greater than the 2-m values, suggesting
   lambdaE from the dense vegetation in the valleys was greater than
   elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{Remotely sensed data in the visible, near-infrared, and thermal-infrared
   wave bands were collected from a low-flying aircraft during the Monsoon
   `90 field experiment. Monsoon `90 was a multidisciplinary experiment
   conducted in a semiarid watershed. It had as one of its objectives the
   quantification of hydrometeorological fluxes during the `'monsoon'' or
   wet season. The remote sensing observations along with
   micrometeorological and atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) data were used
   to compute the surface energy balance over a range of spatial scales.
   The procedure involved averaging multiple pixels along transects flown
   over the meteorological and flux (METFLUX) stations. Average values of
   the spectral reflectance and thermal-infrared temperatures were computed
   for pixels of order 10(-1) to 10(1) km in length and were used with
   atmospheric data for evaluating net radiation (R(n)), soil heat flux
   (G), and sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes at these same length
   scales. The model employs a single-layer resistance approach for
   estimating H that requires wind speed and air temperature in the ABL and
   a remotely sensed surface temperature. The values of R(n) and G are
   estimated from remote sensing information together with near-surface
   observations of air temperature, relative humidity, and solar radiation.
   Finally, LE is solved as the residual term in the surface energy balance
   equation. Model calculations were compared to measurements from the
   METFLUX network for three days having different environmental
   conditions. Average percent differences for the three days between model
   and the METFLUX estimates of the local fluxes were about 5\% for R(n),
   20\% for G and H, and 15\% for LE. Larger differences occurred during
   partly cloudy conditions because of errors in interpreting the remote
   sensing data and the higher spatial and temporal variation in the energy
   fluxes. Minor variations in modeled energy fluxes were observed when the
   pixel size representing the remote sensing inputs changed from 0.2 to 2
   km. Regional scale estimates of the surface energy balance using bulk
   ABL properties for the model parameters and input variables and the
   10-km pixel data differed from the METFLUX network averages by about 4\%
   for R(n), 10\% for G and H, and 15\% for LE. Model sensitivity in
   calculating the turbulent fluxes H and LE to possible variations in key
   model parameters (i.e., the roughness lengths for heat and momentum) was
   found to be fairly significant. Therefore the reliability of the methods
   for estimating key model parameters and potential errors needs further
   testing over different ecosystems and environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{As part of an interdisciplinary effort to describe the hydrologic and
   surface energy balance of a semiarid rangeland watershed, remote and
   ground radiometric surface temperature measurements were collected at
   the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed near Tombstone, Arizona. To
   correct for atmospheric effects on the remotely sensed data, radiosondes
   were launched on and off the watershed, and the LOWTRAN7 radiative
   transfer model was used to evaluate these observed as well as two
   standard atmospheric profiles. Comparison of the results for five
   atmospheric profiles, for each of three days, showed no correlation
   between radiosonde location or launch time and resulting temperature
   corrections. Comparison of corrected temperatures using five different
   atmospheric profiles on each of two days with the corresponding
   ground-based radiometric temperatures demonstrated significant errors
   (greater than 2.0-degrees-C) as the atmospheric profiles generally
   yielded underestimates of ground radiometric temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{A ground- and air-based high spectral resolution data set was collected
   during the summer Monsoon `90 experiment at the Walnut Gulch
   experimental watershed in southeastern Arizona for the purpose of (1)
   characterizing solar and view angle interactions on dry and wet season
   canopy spectra, and (2) exploring the use of multidirectional
   measurements to infer vegetation properties for semiarid watershed
   studies. Bidirectional reflectance factors were measured up to
   40-degrees off nadir with a spectroradiometer over a semidesert
   grassland site. High-spectral resolution aircraft data were collected
   over grass and desert shrub sites in order to investigate scaling
   effects. In this study, solar and view angle effects and interactions on
   canopy spectra varied with spectral wavelength as well as between dry
   and wet seasons. The solar zenith angle modified the view angle behavior
   of the bidirectional reflectance factors. In general, view angle
   influences and spectral signature contrasts were greatest at the larger
   solar zenith angles and similarly, Sun angle influences were more
   apparent at the larger view zenith angle. The scale dependency of the
   data was relatively minor. The bidirectional measurements were
   sufficiently characterized by a physically based bidirectional
   reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. The parameters retrieved
   from the inversion of the BRDF model corresponded with observed
   vegetation variations.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation-related information is critical for modeling hydrological
   processes. Remotely sensed spectral data provide powerful means to
   characterize vegetation status. However, the non-Lambertian behavior of
   most surfaces induces a large view/Sun angle dependence. Two approaches
   are possible to correct such contamination. One approach consists of
   using directional reflectance models; the other consists of normalizing
   the Sun/view angle effects directly on vegetation indices that have the
   advantage of being less sensitive to surface anisotropy than individual
   reflectances. Ground-based multiple view direction/angle measurements
   made over a semiarid grassland canopy at the Walnut Gulch experiment
   watershed (Monsoon `90 experiment) were used to develop and to validate
   a semiempirical model to normalize the MSAVI (modified soil-adjusted
   vegetation index) response to a nadir, regardless of view/direction
   angle. We further advanced this model to account simultaneously for both
   Sun and view angle variations by introducing a shadow parameterization.
   The results showed that this model can be used to monitor the vegetation
   status using a single view/Sun configuration throughout the growing
   season. We therefore believe that we have taken a further step toward
   the development of a multidirectional vegetation index.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the relation between remotely sensed
   spectral data and measurements of vegetation-related hydrologic
   parameters in a semiarid rangeland in southeast Arizona. Throughout the
   measurement periods, ranging from June to September 1990, eight sites in
   the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service
   Walnut Gulch experimental watershed were monitored for water and energy
   fluxes and other meteorological and biological parameters. Corresponding
   spectral data were acquired with ground-based radiometers, low-altitude
   aircraft-mounted instruments, and Landsat thematic mapper sensors.
   Spectral indices were derived from measurements of surface reflectance,
   based on their response to variations in hydrologic parameters and
   sensitivity to unrelated variables, such as solar zenith angle and soil
   differences. A soil-adjusted vegetation index, SAVI (derived from red
   and NIR reflectance factors), was found to be highly correlated with the
   temporal changes in vegetation cover and biomass, but less successful in
   discriminating spatial differences in cover and biomass across the
   watershed. Significant relations were found between the surface-air
   temperature (T(s) - T(a)) difference and measurements of soil moisture
   content, though the shape differed from that previously published for
   bare soil. The relation between daily evaporation rate and measurements
   of (T(s) - T(a)) and daily net radiation was similar to that derived
   previously for irrigated pasture and dryland shortgrass in France but
   differed from that derived for irrigated wheat. These results emphasized
   the strengths and limitations of the use of spectral data for estimation
   of hydrologic characteristics of sparsely vegetated sites and suggested
   a need for reevaluation of common empirical relations between remotely
   sensed measurements and surface characteristics for application to
   rangeland areas.}},

Abstract = {{Radiometric surface temperatures obtained from remote sensing
   measurements are a function of both the physical surface temperature and
   the effective emissivity of the surface within the band pass of the
   radiometric measurement. For sparsely vegetated areas, however, a sensor
   views significant fractions of both bare soil and various vegetation
   types. In this case the radiometric response of a sensor is a function
   of the emissivities and kinetic temperatures of various surface
   elements, the proportion of those surface elements within the field of
   view of the sensor, and the interaction of radiation emitted from the
   various surface components. In order to effectively utilize thermal
   remote sensing data to quantify energy balance components for a sparsely
   vegetated area, it is important to examine the typical magnitude and
   degree of variability of emissivity and surface temperature for such
   surfaces. Surface emissivity measurements and ground and
   low-altitude-aircraft-based surface temperature measurements (8-13 mum
   band pass) made in conjunction with the Monsoon `90 field experiment
   were used to evaluate the typical variability of those quantities during
   the summer rainy season in a semiarid watershed. The average value for
   thermal band emissivity of the exposed bare soil portions of the surface
   was found to be approximately 0.96; the average value measured for most
   of the varieties of desert shrubs present was approximately 0.99.
   Surface composite emissivity was estimated to be approximately 0.98 for
   both the grass-dominated and shrub-dominated portions of the watershed.
   The spatial variability of surface temperature was found to be highly
   dependent on the spatial scale of integration for the instantaneous
   field of view (IFOV) of the instrument, the spatial scale of the total
   area under evaluation, and the time of day. For the conditions which
   existed during most of the Monsoon `90 experiment, the differences in
   kinetic (physical) temperature between the vegetation and soil
   background were typically between 10-degrees and 25-degrees-C at midday.
   These differences gave rise to large variations in radiometric composite
   surface temperatures observed with a ground-based instrument
   configuration which allowed a ground IFOV of approximately 0.5 m. An
   evaluation of the frequency distribution for these observations
   indicated that the variance in surface temperature observed over an
   intensively sampled target area (approximately 500 m x 120 m) increased
   significantly in the early to late morning hours of a typical diurnal
   heating cycle. For aircraft-based composite radiometric temperature
   measurements at the watershed scale (with ground IFOV of approximately
   40 m for each observation), much of the variability in surface
   temperature due to differences in soil and vegetation temperature was
   integrated into a single measurement; consequently, the variance between
   observations over the watershed was not significantly larger than those
   observed at length scales of 100 m.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution of vegetation properties is fundamental for understanding
   vegetation patterns and characteristics, improving estimates of
   infiltration, evapotranspiration, and soil erosion. A laser altimeter
   mounted in a small airplane was used to measure surface patterns of the
   landscape on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research
   Service Walnut Gulch experimental watershed near Tombstone, Arizona. The
   airborne laser altimeter is a pulsed gallium-arsenide diode laser,
   transmitting and receiving 4000 pulses per second at a wavelength of
   0.904 mum. The laser has a 1-mrad field of view and is designed to have
   a vertical recording precision of 0.05 m on a single measurement.
   Aircraft altitude varied between 100 and 300 m for the flights. Digital
   data from the laser were collected with a portable computer and analyzed
   to provide information on changes in vegetation height, spatial
   patterns, and patchiness of vegetation cover. The laser-measured
   vegetation properties of plant height and canopy cover (>0.3 m) were not
   significantly different than field measurements made using the
   line-intercept transect method at seven of the eight sites evaluated.
   Although the laser measurements of canopy height were not significantly
   different from the ground measurements, the laser consistently
   overestimated canopy cover less than 0.3 m in height and underestimated
   canopy cover greater than 0.5 m. New techniques to discriminate the
   background noise in the laser return signal in sparsely populated shrub
   communities are necessary before this technique will be fully useful in
   estimating canopy cover on rangelands. These studies indicate the
   potential of airborne laser to measure vegetation patterns quickly and
   quantitatively. The laser also has the ability to separate and map
   distinctly different plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{The push broom microwave radiometer (PBMR) was flown on six flights of
   the NASA C-130 to map the surface soil moisture over the U.S. Department
   of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch experimental
   watershed in southeastern Arizona. The PBMR operates at a wavelength of
   21 cm and has four horizontally polarized beams which cover a swath of
   1.2 times the aircraft altitude. By flying a series of parallel flight
   lines it was possible to map the microwave brightness temperature
   (T(B)), and thus the soil moisture, over a large area. In this case the
   area was approximately 8 by 20 km. The moisture conditions ranged from
   very dry, <2\% by volume, to quite wet, >15\%, after a heavy rain. The
   rain amounts ranged from less than 10 mm to more than 50 mm over the
   area mapped with the PBMR. With the PBMR we were able to observe the
   spatial variations of the rain amounts and the temporal variation as the
   soil dried. The T(B) values were registered to a Universal Transverse
   Mercator grid so that they could be compared to the rain gage readings
   and to the ground measurements of soil moisture in the 0- to 5-cm layer.
   The decreases in T(B) were well correlated with the rainfall amounts, R2
   = 0.9, and the comparison of T(B) with soil moisture was also good with
   an R2 of about 0.8. For the latter, there was some dependence of the
   relation on location, which may be due to soil or vegetation variations
   over the area mapped. The application of these data to runoff forecasts
   and flux estimates will be discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to estimate the effective aerodynamic roughness of a
   complex landscape is presented. High-resolution elevation profiles
   measured with an airbome laser altimeter have been used to compute
   geometrical parameters of three landscape elements of the Walnut Gulch
   experimental watershed, Arizona. Mean crop height, its standard
   deviation, and the frequency distribution (as a function of penetration
   depth) of plant elements hit by the laser beam have been calculated for
   short segments (1 m) measured over intervening grass between shrubs.
   Longer segments have been applied to obtain the mean height and spacing
   of taller shrubs and trees. Finally, laser profiles covering the entire
   watershed gave the mean amplitude and wavelength of hillocks and ridges.
   The aerodynamic roughness length of the intervening grass is estimated
   using the ratio of standard deviation to vegetation height, corrected
   for instrument noise, times mean height. An effective roughness length
   which parameterizes the total stress due to grass and taller shrubs and
   trees is calculated first. Finally, a watershed-scale effective
   roughness length is calculated combining the amplitude and wavelength of
   hillocks and ridges with the roughness length obtained in the previous
   step.}},

Abstract = {{An interdisciplinary field experiment was conducted to study the water
   and energy balance of a semiarid rangeland watershed in southeast
   Arizona during the summer of 1990. Two subwatersheds, one grass
   dominated and the other shrub dominated, were selected for intensive
   study with ground-based remote sensing systems and hydrometeorological
   instrumentation. Surface energy balance was evaluated at both sites
   using direct and indirect measurements of the turbulent fluxes (eddy
   correlation, variance, and Bowen ratio methods) and using an aerodynamic
   approach based on remote measurements of surface reflectance and
   temperature and conventional meteorological information. Estimates of
   net radiant flux density (R(n)), derived from measurements of air
   temperature, incoming solar radiation, and surface temperature and
   radiance compared well with values measured using a net radiometer (mean
   absolute difference (MAD) congruent-to 50 W/m2 over a range from 115 to
   670 W/m2). Soil heat flux density (G) was estimated using a relation
   between G/R(n) and a spectral vegetation index computed from the red and
   near-infrared surface reflectance. These G estimates compared well with
   conventional measurements of G using buried soil heat flux plates (MAD
   congruent-to 20 W/m2 over a range from - 13 to 213 W/m2). In order to
   account for the effects of sparse vegetation, semiempirical adjustments
   to the single-layer bulk aerodynamic resistance approach were required
   for evaluation of sensible heat flux density (H). This yielded
   differences between measurements and remote estimates of H of
   approximately 33 W/m2 over a range from 13 to 303 W/m2. The resulting
   estimates of latent heat flux density, LE, were of the same magnitude
   and trend as measured values; however, a significant scatter was still
   observed: MAD congruent-to 40 W/M2 over a range from 0 to 340 W/m2.
   Because LE was solved as a residual, there was a cumulative effect of
   errors associated with remote estimates of R(n), G, and H.}},

Abstract = {{A network of meteorological stations was installed during the Monsoon
   `90 field campaign in the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed. The study
   area has a fairly complex surface. The vegetation cover is heterogeneous
   and sparse, and the terrain is mildly hilly, but dissected by ephemeral
   channels. Besides measurement of some of the standard weather data such
   as wind speed, air temperature, and solar radiation, these sites also
   contained instruments for estimating the local surface energy balance.
   The approach utilized measurements of net radiation (R(n)), soil heat
   flux (G) and Monin-Obukhov similarity theory applied to first- and
   second-order turbulent statistics of wind speed and temperature for
   determining the sensible heat flux (H). The latent heat flux (LE) was
   solved as a residual in the surface energy balance equation, namely, LE
   = -(R(n) + G + H). This procedure (VAR-RESID) for estimating the energy
   fluxes satisfied monetary constraints and the requirement for low
   maintenance and continued operation through the harsh environmental
   conditions experienced in semiarid regions. Comparison of energy fluxes
   using this approach with more traditional eddy correlation techniques
   showed differences were within 20\% under unstable conditions. Similar
   variability in flux estimates over the study area was present in the
   eddy correlation data. Hence, estimates of H and LE using the VAR-RESID
   approach under unstable conditions were considered satisfactory. Also,
   with second-order statistics of vertical velocity collected at several
   sites, the local momentum roughness length was estimated. This is an
   important parameter used in, modeling the turbulent transfer of momentum
   and sensible heat fluxes across the surface-atmosphere interface.}},

   INSTANTANEOUS SURFACE-ENERGY BALANCE COMPONENTS OVER A SEMIARID

Abstract = {{A primary motivation for using remotely sensed data to estimate
   components of the surface energy balance is to quantify surface energy
   fluxes in a spatially distributed manner over various spatial scales.
   However, all models which utilize remotely sensed data to estimate
   surface fluxes also require input variables and parameters which cannot
   be estimated on a spatially distributed basis with remotely sensed data.
   In this analysis, data from the Monsoon `90 experiment were used to
   evaluate the limitations in spatially extending a relatively simple
   energy balance model with remotely sensed data over a semiarid rangeland
   watershed. Using one ground-based meteorological and flux station as a
   reference site, aircraft-based remotely sensed data (surface
   temperatures and reflectances) were used to compute energy balance
   components for seven other locations within the watershed. The results
   indicated that for clear sky conditions, all components of the surface
   energy balance could be estimated to within approximately the same level
   of uncertainty with which the fluxes were measured with ground-based
   flux instrumentation. However, under partly cloudy conditions the
   variability in incoming solar radiation across the watershed
   significantly degraded the estimation of distributed values of net
   radiation (R(net)). If ground-based estimates of incoming solar
   radiation are used to calculate R(net) from remotely sensed data, then
   the spatial extent over which that measurement is valid limits the area
   over which accurate spatially distributed values of R(net) can be
   estimated. Additionally, the results of sensitivity analyses indicate
   that the level of uncertainty to which the roughness length for
   momentum, or z0m, is typically known for spatially distributed values in
   an area of naturally variable vegetation can give rise to significant
   uncertainties in the estimation of sensible heat flux. For areas where
   the spatial variation in roughness parameters is of the order of several
   centimeters, the error associated with assuming constant values for the
   roughness length for momentum is similar in size to the errors
   associated with temperature variations of the order of several degrees.
   In order to utilize radiometric temperatures to reliably estimate
   spatially distributed values of sensible heat flux, techniques such as
   those explored by Menenti and Ritchie (this issue) are needed to provide
   spatially distributed information on surface roughness parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Semiarid regions exhibit large temporal and spatial variability in
   surface conditions and, therefore, pose a challenge for estimating
   components of the surface energy budget. In particular, it is difficult
   to estimate the evapotranspiration component of the hydrological cycle.
   Because evapotranspiration is strongly controlled by absorbed solar
   radiation, an attempt has been made here to evaluate the accuracy at
   which the downward shortwave irradiance (SW down) can be estimated from
   satellites on basin scale. It was demonstrated that even under highly
   variable cloud conditions, satellite estimates of SW down daily means
   were within 10\% of measured values, while 5-day means were within 3\%
   of measured values. Such accuracies are of relevance for hydrological
   modeling at watershed and basin scales.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat and
   the properties of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) were studied for
   the Walnut Gulch watershed. The properties of the ABL were estimated
   from radiosonde measurements. Application of integrated simplified
   conservation equations resulted in estimates of regional fluxes that
   were greatly different from surface values, and often had the wrong
   sign. A simple modification was made to the equations, based upon the
   temporal changes in temperature and humidity above the ABL, assuming
   that such changes resulted from horizontal advection. Subsidence was
   assumed to be insignificant. Application of the new integrated
   conservation equations resulted in a dramatic improvement in the
   regional flux estimates. Such estimates were reasonably close to the
   surface measurements. Spatial variations in surface energy balance which
   resulted from the convective rain events affected only the properties of
   the lower 15 m of the atmosphere. The length scale of variations in
   surface moisture of about 10 km was not sufficient to affect the
   regional scale processes.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of aircraft remotely sensed and conventional ground-based
   measurements of volumetric soil water content (SW) were made over two
   subwatersheds (4.4 and 631 ha) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
   Agricultural Research Service Walnut Gulch experimental watershed during
   the 1990 monsoon season. Spatially distributed soil water contents
   estimated remotely from the NASA push broom microwave radiometer (PBMR),
   an Institute of Radioengineering and Electronics (IRE) multifrequency
   radiometer, and three ground-based point methods were used to define
   prestorm initial SW for a distributed rainfall-runoff model (KINEROS;
   Woolhiser et al., 1990) at a small catchment scale (4.4 ha). At a medium
   catchment scale (631 ha or 6.31 km2) spatially distributed PBMR SW data
   were aggregated via stream order reduction. The impacts of the various
   spatial averages of SW on runoff simulations are discussed and are
   compared to runoff simulations using SW estimates derived from a simple
   daily water balance model. It was found that at the small catchment
   scale the SW data obtained from any of the measurement methods could be
   used to obtain reasonable runoff predictions. At the medium catchment
   scale, a basin-wide remotely sensed average of initial water content was
   sufficient for runoff simulations. This has important implications for
   the possible use of satellite-based microwave soil moisture data to
   define prestorm SW because the low spatial resolutions of such sensors
   may not seriously impact runoff simulations under the conditions
   examined. However, at both the small and medium basin scale, adequate
   resources must be devoted to proper definition of the input rainfall to
   achieve reasonable runoff simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Most groundwater flow models are not sufficiently detailed to allow an
   explicit representation of all dynamical scales. Instead, most models
   are constructed at such a coarse scale of resolution that unresolved
   subgrid variability often exists. It is therefore important to
   understand the interaction between unresolved dynamics and explicitly
   resolved dynamics. The concept of universality is central to this
   interaction and is here related to the problem of rescaling models of
   groundwater flow. We examine when it is possible to construct an
   accurate model for the explicitly resolved large scales, without an
   explicit description of the subgrid scale dynamics. We demonstrate how
   unresolved subgrid scale dynamics interact with resolved scale dynamics.
   We show that a universally valid resolved scale model can be constructed
   if the resolved dynamics are sufficiently independent of the details of
   the subgrid scale dynamics. In that event, a resolved scale model is
   composed of a universal structure and accompanying model parameters. The
   model parameters represent the effect of unresolved dynamics upon
   resolved dynamics. We examine two possible model structures for
   groundwater flow. We show theoretically, and numerically, that a local
   Darcy law is a universally valid resolved scale model if the resolved
   and subgrid scales of the hydraulic conductivity are separated in scale
   by a so-called spectral gap. If, however, the hydraulic conductivity
   possesses many scales of variability, then a more general nonlocal Darcy
   law is a more appropriate model structure. When the nonlocal Darcy's law
   is more appropriate, numerical experiments suggest that errors using a
   local Darcy's law with effective parameters are most significant at the
   smallest resolving scale of the model, and are minimal at scales between
   8 and 16 times the resolving scale.}},

Abstract = {{Flow and solute transport through porous media having strongly variable
   permeability were studied for parallel and convergent/divergent flows.
   The variation in hydraulic conductivity K causes (1) the fluid to flow
   through a porous medium along least resistive pathways and (2) solute
   dissolved in the fluid to be transported with widely differing
   velocities. Numerical simulations were performed to study flow and
   solute transport in a three-dimensional heterogeneous porous block. It
   is found that for a strongly heterogeneous medium the particles (or
   solutes) travel through the medium along preferred flow paths, which we
   call channels. These channels possess hydraulic properties that are
   different from those of the global porous medium and which are invariant
   regardless of the direction from which the hydraulic gradient is applied
   to the porous block. The log-hydraulic conductivities along these
   channels have a greater mean value and a smaller standard deviation than
   for the global porous medium. These differences or `'shifts'' were
   calculated as a function of the hydraulic conductivity variance of the
   global porous medium. Tracer breakthrough curves for a pulse injection
   were also calculated. For small standard deviations of the global
   hydraulic conductivity distribution, a peak in the breakthrough curve is
   found which spreads out around its peak value as the standard deviation
   is increased. However, as the standard deviation is increased further, a
   new peak emerges at a much earlier time. This may be the result of
   increasing channeling effects at large standard deviations. For the cage
   of a spherical pressure boundary around point tracer injection, the flow
   follows the usual divergent pattern only for small variations in
   hydraulic conductivity. When the standard deviation in log K is large, a
   significant portion of the flow becomes channelized; i.e., it tends
   toward a linear flow pattern.}},

Abstract = {{A problem of significant interest to environmental scientists is the
   flow of water and solutes through the vadose zone. The partial
   differential equations which govern this flow are typically
   time-dependent and nonlinear. Valid solutions to these equations require
   (1) accurate relationships between various coefficients and variables on
   which they depend (e.g., coefficient of diffusivity and water content)
   and (2) sophisticated numerical methods which can handle complexities
   such as sharp moving fronts. In cases where coefficients are not known
   explicitly, curve-fitting techniques are needed to smooth out scattered
   experimental data. Nonlinear coefficients can then be calculated. A
   constrained least squares spline fit is compared to empirical function
   fits which have appeared recently. Then, a state-of-the-art numerical
   technique is used to accurately model transient flow through unsaturated
   homogeneous soils. The moving finite element method of Miller and
   colleagues is an adaptive approach in the sense that the grid moves so
   that nodes are concentrated where they are most needed. As a result,
   better accuracy is achieved with fewer nodes than are required for
   standard fixed-grid methods. Petzold's robust Gear-type solver DASSL is
   used for time-integration. Numerical results are compared to
   experimental data. Mass balance errors are neglible, and accurate
   solutions are obtained at all time steps. Though only one-dimensional
   problems are considered here, the numerical approach generalizes to
   heterogeneous media and problems in higher dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{The moments of a conservative tracer cloud migrating in a mean uniform
   flow field are estimated using an operator approximation scheme; results
   are presented for the second, third, and fourth central moments in the
   mean flow direction. It is assumed that the spatially variable flow
   field, and therefore the tracer migration problem itself, is amenable to
   a probabilistic description; the effects of local dispersion on cloud
   migration are neglected in this study. Variation in the flow field is
   assumed to be the result of spatial variation in the hydraulic
   conductivity; spatial variation in porosity is assumed negligible. The
   operator approximation scheme, as implemented in this study, is
   second-order correct, which requires a second-order correct
   approximation of the velocity field correlation structure. Because
   estimation of the velocity correlation structure is decidedly the most
   difficult aspect of second-order analysis, an ad hoc extension of the
   imperfectly stratified approximation developed earlier is implemented
   for this purpose. The first-order approximation resulting from the
   operator expansion scheme is equivalent to small perturbation Eulerian
   results presented earlier (Naff, 1990, 1992). The infinite-order
   approximation resulting from this scheme is equivalent to the
   exponential operator results obtained by Van Kampen (1976).}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid finite analytic method, a numerical technique, was used to
   solve lateral subsurface storm flow described by the extended
   Dupuit-Forchheimer equation. In subregions the local linearized
   one-dimensional Dupuit-Forchheimer equation was solved analytically in
   space and discretized in time by a simple difference formula. This is
   called a hybrid finite analytic approach. The system of algebraic
   equations obtained by the hybrid finite analytic approach can
   approximately preserve the overall nonlinear effect because the term
   (partial derivativeH/partial derivativeX)2 and the coefficient of
   diffusion are treated as constants only in the local regions. A
   four-point numerical formula can provide results that are stable and
   acceptably accurate without complex calculation and without small time
   steps. The comparison between steady state profiles of the water table
   provided by this study with profiles provided by previous investigations
   shows that the method performs very well in the analysis of lateral
   subsurface storm flow.}},

Abstract = {{Use of geostatistics in hydrology, reservoir engineering, soil physics,
   and environmental science has expanded vastly in the last few years.
   Since the semivariance is the backbone of geostatistics, it is very
   important to estimate it accurately. Building on Matheron's classical
   formula, there are several improved semivariance estimators, but they
   are only reliable at small lag distances. For large lag distances all
   estimators can produce erratic results that may lead to a
   misinterpretation of the spatial structure of a given data set. The lack
   of precision is primarily caused by a shrinking number of observation
   pairs as lag distance increases. This paper presents a new semivariance
   estimator that uses all given data at all lag distances. In addition,
   the new estimator is not restricted to samples taken along lines, and it
   easily accounts for missing data. We compare the new estimator to
   existing ones on simulated data sets as well as three outcrop data sets.
   The results show that the new estimator is unbiased, robust, and
   resistant to contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Paleohydrological procedures were used to analyze spatial variations in
   flood magnitude in drainage basins of the Santa Catalina Mountains
   (maximum elevation 2791 m), southeastern Arizona. Paleoflood
   reconstructions in eight watersheds, ranging from 10 to 110 km2, were
   obtained for the largest floods in stable canyon reaches, yielding
   discharges ranging from 50 to 270 m3 s-1. Although there is a high
   correlation between drainage area and flood magnitude, it is also clear
   that basins located in the southern half of the Santa Catalina Mountains
   have larger unit discharges (peak discharge divided by drainage area)
   and that these values decrease toward the northern part of the range.
   This spatial pattern is probably the result of local hydroclimatological
   conditions whereby the largest floods are associated with the northward
   influx of moist, tropical, and subtropical air. For this atmospheric
   circulation the northern part of the range experiences a rain shadow
   effect that decreases the unit discharges generated in those basins. The
   unusually high unit discharge for one of the south facing basins is
   explained by its basin morphometry. Inverse problem solutions using a
   rainfall-runoff model demonstrate that both this basin and another with
   a comparable drainage area but a much lower estimated peak paleoflood
   discharge can have their peak flood outputs produced by the same storm
   intensity. The results demonstrate the potential of paleoflood data
   collection for understanding spatial variability in small basin flood
   hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) uses a degree-day approach for melting
   snow in a basin. A simple radiation component was combined with the
   degree-day approach (restricted degree-day method) in an effort to
   improve estimates of snowmelt and reduce the need to adjust the melt
   factor over the ablation season. A daily energy balance model was
   formulated that requires not only the input of radiation but also
   measurements of daily wind speed, air temperature, and relative
   humidity. The three approaches for computing snowmelt, namely, the
   degree-day, restricted degree-day, and daily energy balance model were
   tested at the local scale by comparing melt rates with lysimeter outflow
   measurements. Because radiation measurements are not often available, a
   simple model for simulating shortwave and longwave components of the
   radiation balance that requires minimal information (i.e., daily cloud
   cover estimates, air temperature, and relative humidity) was developed
   It was found that clouds and their effects on daily insolation at the
   surface can produce significant differences between measured and model
   estimates. In the comparisons of snowmelt estimates with the lysimeter
   outflow, the restricted degree-day method yielded melt rates that were
   in better agreement with the observed outflow than the degree-day method
   and were practically the same as estimates given by the energy balance
   model. A sensitivity analysis of runoff generated with SRM using as
   input the local snowmelt computations given by the three models and
   measured outflow from the lysimeter was performed for a basin. A
   comparison of the synthetic hydrographs for the basin suggests that a
   radiation-based snowmelt factor may improve runoff predictions at the
   basin scale.}},

Abstract = {{Flood routing in a given reach of a prismatic channel is the process of
   deriving the downstream outflow hydrograph from a known inflow
   hydrograph at the upstream end of the channel reach. The process can be
   carried out by solving the basic St.-Venant (S-V) equation numerically
   or by using a lumped model, also called a hydrologic or black-box model,
   which requires calibration with observed data. The model should also be
   capable of reproducing the flow hydrograph at one or more intermediate
   points along the channel reach. This requires that at least one of the
   model parameters be proportional to the length of the channel reach.
   Another desired property of the routing model is that the outflow
   hydrograph produced at the downstream end of a channel reach be the same
   when the model is applied to the entire reach, as one unit, or when the
   model is applied to a number of sections or subdivisions of the channel
   reach in series, using the outflow of one section as inflow to the next
   section. The resulting outflow hydrograph at the downstream end of the
   reach should thus be independent of the number or lengths of the
   subdivisions. The above desired properties of the routing model impose
   certain conditions on the model or, if the model is linear, on its
   impulse response function (IRF). The conditions are derived in this
   paper and applied to two models: the linear channel model and the
   diffusion analogy model.}},

Abstract = {{A model for multistation precipitation, conditional on synoptic
   atmospheric patterns, is presented. The model, which we call the
   nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM), postulates the existence of
   an unobserved weather state, which serves as a link between the
   large-scale atmospheric measures and the small-scale spatially
   discontinuous precipitation field. The weather state effectively acts as
   an automatic classifier of atmospheric patterns. The weather state
   process is assumed to be conditionally Markov, given the atmospheric
   data. The rainfall process is then assumed to be conditionally
   independent given the weather state. Various parameterizations for the
   weather state process and the rainfall process are discussed, and a
   likelihood-based estimation procedure is described. Model-based
   estimates of the storm duration distribution and first and second
   moments of the rainfall process are derived. As an example the model is
   fit to a four-station network of rain gauge stations in Washington
   state. The observed first and second moments are reproduced very
   closely. The fitted duration distributions are somewhat lighter tailed
   than the observed distribution at two of the four stations but provide a
   good fit at the other two. We conclude that the NHMM has promise as a
   method of relating synoptic atmospheric data to rainfall and other
   regional or local hydrologic processes.}},

Abstract = {{General circulation models (GCMs) currently perform vertical water and
   energy balances at 20- or 30-min time intervals for grid points
   2-degrees-4-degrees apart but generally contain no information on the
   land-phase transfer of water between grid points or within watersheds.
   As a result, they operate on an incomplete hydrological cycle. This
   study combines a hydrological model with a GCM for a macroscale
   watershed. A water balance was carried out at 12-hour time intervals for
   a 10-year period using the Canadian Climate Centre GCM II data set for
   grid points within and surrounding the 1.6 X 10(6) km2 Mackenzie River
   Basin in northwestern Canada. The water surpluses from each relevant
   grid point were accumulated to provide a simulated hydrograph at the
   outlet of the Mackenzie River. A hydrological model was calibrated and
   verified using 5 years of recorded climatological and hydrometric data
   as well as land cover data from classified National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer
   images. The climatological outputs from the GCM (precipitation,
   temperature, and evaporation) were then used as inputs to the
   hydrological model, generating a second hydrograph for the Mackenzie
   River. The results show that using the hydrological model with the GCM
   data produces a better representation of the recorded flow regime. The
   study provides a means of verifying the performance of the GCM and is a
   first step in developing a continental-scale hydrological model which
   will, ultimately, form a part of a full model of the global hydrological
   cycle.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of dissolved hydrogen and other biologically active solutes
   in groundwater from a shallow petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifer
   indicate that the distribution of microbial terminal electron-accepting
   processes (TEAPs), such as methanogenesis, sulfate reduction, and ferric
   iron (Fe (III)) reduction, is highly dynamic in both time and space.
   Delivery of sulfate to methanogenic zones by infiltrating recharge or
   lateral transport can result in a TEAP shift from methanogenesis to
   sulfate reduction. Conversely, lack of recharge and consumption of
   available sulfate can result in a shift from sulfate reduction to
   methanogenesis. Temporal shifts between sulfate and Fe (III) reduction
   were also observed. Time lags associated with TEAP shifts ranged from
   less than 10 days to about 3 1/2 months. The relation between TEAP and
   biodegradation rates of a variety of organic compounds indicate that
   biodegradation rates of petroleum hydrocarbons probably vary temporally
   and spatially in a contaminated aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{A model enabling extraction of hydrologic information from spatial and
   temporal patterns in measurements of isotope ratios in water-rock
   systems is presented. The model describes the evolution of isotope
   ratios in response to solute transport and water-rock interaction. In
   advective systems, a single dimensionless parameter (a Damkohler number,
   N(D)) dominates in determining the distance over which isotopic
   equilibrium between the water and rock is approached. Some isotope
   ratios act as conservative tracers (N(D) much less than 1), while others
   reflect only interaction with the local host rock (N(D) much greater
   than 1). If N(D) is close to one (i.e., the distance for equilibration
   is close to the length scale of observation), isotope ratio measurements
   can be used to determine N(D), which in turn may yield information
   concerning reaction rates, or spatial variations in water velocity.
   Zones of high velocity (e.g., as a result Of greater fracture density),
   or less reactive zones, may be identified  through observation of their
   lower N(D) values. The model is applied to paleohydrologic
   interpretations of Sr isotope data from calcite fracture fillings in
   drill cores from Yucca Mountain, Nevada (Marshall et al., 1992). The
   results agree with other studies suggesting `'fast path'' transport in
   the unsaturated zone. Also, we find that the data do not give a
   conclusive indication of paleowater table elevation because of the
   effects of water-rock interaction.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic algorithm (GA), a new search technique, is applied to a
   multiple objective groundwater pollution containment problem. This
   problem involves finding the set of optimal solutions on the trade-off
   curve between the reliability and cost of a hydraulic containment
   system. The decision variables are how many wells to install, where to
   install them, and how much to pump from each. The GA is an optimization
   technique patterned after the biological processes of natural selection
   and evolution. A GA operates on a population of decision variable sets.
   Through the application of three specialized genetic operators:
   selection, crossover, and mutation, a GA population `'evolves'' toward
   an optimal solution. In the paper, simple GAs and GAs that can solve
   multiple objective problems are described. Two variations of a multiple
   objective GA are formulated: a vector-evaluated GA (VEGA) and a Pareto
   GA. For the zero-fixed cost situation, the Pareto GA is shown to be
   superior to the VEGA and is shown to produce a trade-off curve similar
   to that obtained via another optimization technique, mixed integer
   chance constrained programming (MICCP). The effect on the VEGA and
   Pareto GA of parameter variation is shown. The Pareto GA is shown to be
   capable of incorporating the fixed costs associated with installing a
   system of wells. Results for several levels of fixed cost are presented.
   A comparison of computer resources required by the GAs and the MICCP
   method is given. Future research plans are discussed, including the
   incorporation of the objective of pump-out time into the model and the
   development of parallelized GAs.}},

Abstract = {{A new formulation for the optimal design of aquifer remediation
   strategies is presented in which the well location problem is solved by
   explicitly incorporating the spatial coordinates and pumping rates of
   wells as decision variables. The Hermite interpolation function is used
   to represent the well location as a continuous function of space and to
   facilitate the incorporation of a barrier function for containing the
   well location within the model domain. The management model combines the
   numerical simulation of groundwater flow and contaminant transport with
   optimization methods to select the optimal location and pump rate by
   moving each well within the problem domain unrestricted by nodal
   location. The details of the numerical implementation required to
   incorporate well locations as decision variables in a two-dimensional
   Galerkin finite element discretization of the groundwater flow and
   contaminant transport equations are presented. The approach is
   contrasted with an optimization model for groundwater quality management
   in which optimal well locations are chosen from a number of preselected
   candidate locations. A simple hypothetical problem is solved to compare
   these two approaches and examine the numerical behavior of the new
   formulation. The results indicate that a formulation in which well
   location is a decision variable can be implemented and that improved
   solutions are possible. The results are also used to demonstrate how
   this approach can be used to solve problems in which the initial costs
   of well installation are included.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the significance of the gas-water interface on
   colloid sorption and transport.  Three types of common saturation
   conditions were simulated in packed sand columns:  (1) a completely
   water-saturated condition, (2) gas bubbles trapped by capillary forces
   as a nonwetting residual phase (15\% gas), and (3) gas present as a
   continuous phase (46\% gas), or in other words, a vadose zone situation.
   Different saturations provided different interfacial conditions.  Two
   types of polystyrene latex particles (0.2 mum), hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic, were used in each of the three saturations.  Relative
   surface hydrophobicity of latex particles was characterized by contact
   angle measurements.  Each experiment was repeated five times.  A total
   of 30 columns with good reproducible packing and gas content gave
   reproducible particle breakthrough curves.  The retention of both
   hydrophilic and hydrophobic colloids increased with gas content of the
   porous medium.  Colloids preferentially sorbed onto the gas-water
   interface relative to the matrix surface.  The degree of sorption
   increased with the increase of colloid surface hydrophobicity.  The
   results validate and quantify direct microscopic scale visualization
   observations made in two-dimensional pore network glass micromodels (Wan
   and Wilson, 1994).  These findings suggest an additional mechanism for
   filtration and for particulate transport in the subsurface environment,
   whenever more than one fluid phase is present.  The results also give
   clear evidence that the presence of inadvertently trapped residual gas
   could help explain the discrepancy between water-saturated laboratory
   column experiments and related theory.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory technique has been developed to measure the hysteretic
   relationship between capillary pressure and fluid saturation for a
   rough-walled rock fracture under different states of normal stress.  The
   technique incorporates a loading system and a uniquely designed
   capillary barrier to the nonwetting phase which allows for fracture
   closure and provides excellent hydraulic connection of the wetting phase
   in the fracture with external pressure control.  The method is applied
   to a single, rough-walled fracture in limestone using oil and water as
   the nonwetting and wetting phase, respectively.  The measured capillary
   pressure curves were found to be well represented by a Brooks-Corey
   porous media capillary pressure function.  A distinct entry pressure,
   giving rise to initial nonwetting phase invasion, was observed in each
   test.  It was found that the inferred aperture distributions became less
   skewed with increased normal load.  These aperture distributions were
   inferred using one of three conceptual models presented for nonwetting
   phase invasion of a rough-walled fracture under conditions of main
   drainage.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface flow from various portions of a soil profile on a steep,
   forested hillslope was evaluated by two sets of step-change miscible
   displacement tests at different application rates and antecedent
   hydrologic conditions.  Solutions of NaCl (1000 mg L-1 Cl-) were applied
   at steady state rates (equivalent to 20 and 30 mm h-1 of standing water
   over the entire plot area) using a line irrigation source located 1.5 m
   upslope (lateral distance) from an excavated soil pit.  Subsurface flow
   and tracer breakthrough from five portions (the organic-rich soil layer
   including macropores, the mineral soil matrix, and three groups of
   macropores in the mineral soil layer) of the soil profile were
   individually measured and analyzed using a convective-dispersive model. 
   Matrix flow dominated discharge from the soil pit during tracer tests
   (70-93\% of total discharge).  However, during wet periods with upslope
   drainage, macropores (including organic-rich soil) contributed
   proportionally more flow than during periods when upslope drainage was
   minimal.  Outflow from macropores during the test with wet antecedent
   conditions had lower Cl- concentrations than drainage from the soil
   matrix, suggesting dilution in macropores from upslope drainage. 
   Effective pore volumes calculated for the flow-averaged breakthrough
   data from the entire profile were much less (< 40\%) than the estimates
   (measured by tensiometers) of total volume of pore water, suggesting
   that preferential flow significantly contributed to subsurface transport
   of tracer.  The pore volume for the entire profile increased only
   slightly with increasing application rate; however, the relative
   proportions of pore volumes calculated for individual portions varied
   proportionally to antecedent hydrologic conditions.  These changes are
   attributed to the expansion of individual macropores with surrounding
   soil and the lateral extension of macropore networks during wetter
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Many models for soil water retention have been proposed.  However, most
   of these models are curve-fitting equations and do not emphasize the
   physical significance of their empirical parameters.  A new retention
   model that exhibits increased flexibility was developed by applying
   three-parameter lognormal distribution laws to the pore radius
   distribution function f(r) and to the water capacity function, which was
   taken to be the pore capillary pressure distribution function f(psi). 
   This model contains three parameters that are closely related to the
   statistics of f(psi):  the bubbling pressure psi(c), the mode psi0 of
   f(psi), and the standard deviation sigma of transformed f(psi).  By
   comparison of this model with three existing models (the van Genuchten
   model, the Brooks-Corey model, and the modified Tani model), it was
   shown that psi(c), psi0, and sigma are all essential for a general
   retention model.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model has been developed to provide areal analyses of the
   three-dimensional spreading of immiscible liquids in groundwater
   systems.  The model is intended for specific use in prediction of
   hydrocarbon spreading from subsurface leaks and spills and in design and
   performance evaluation of remedial schemes.  The mathematical
   formulation is based on vertical integration of the three-dimensional
   two-phase flow equations and incorporation of the concept of
   gravity-capillary vertical equilibrium (GCVE) in which a vertical
   balance of gravitational and capillary forces is assumed. 
   History-dependent pseudo functions of capillary pressure and relative
   permeabilities are introduced for the present GCVE model.  A direct
   numerical procedure for evaluating the pseudo functions is derived and
   verified using an example given in the petroleum literature.  An
   overview of numerical techniques for solving the nonlinear governing
   equations is presented.  Special schemes for handling production wells
   are derived.  Simulation examples are provided to verify, validate, and
   demonstrate utility of the model.  Numerical results obtained from the
   GCVE model are compared with analytical and rigorous multiphase
   three-dimensional numerical solutions.  The model is further validated
   using data from a laboratory investigation on waterflood, five-spot well
   performance.  The results of these comparisons show the validity of the
   GCVE modeling assumptions and accuracy and robustness of the proposed
   formulations and computational schemes.  The numerical study also
   indicates that the present model is highly efficient and suitable for
   field simulations on personal computers or workstations.}},

Year = {{1994}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Interfacial or fingering instabilities have been studied recently in
   relation to contamination problems where a more dense plume is enclosed
   by and is moving along in a body of less dense fluid.  Instabilities can
   play an important role in the mixing or dispersion process.  Through the
   use of a variable density flow and transport code, we were able to study
   how the style of interfacial perturbation controls the pattern of
   instability development.  Whether initial perturbation grow or decay
   depends mainly on the wavelength of the perturbing function.  A critical
   perturbation wavelength must be exceeded for a perturbation to grow;
   otherwise the perturbation simply decays.  Our work confirms earlier
   analyses that suggest that all stratified systems are inherently
   unstable, given some spectrum of the perturbing waves that exceed the
   critical wavelength.  By implication, Rayleigh number stability criteria
   are inappropriate for evaluating the dense plume problem.  Our study
   also demonstrates how numerical errors in a mass transport code can
   serve as a perturbing function and lead to the development of
   instabilities.  However, these instabilities are not physically
   realistic and are essentially uncontrollable because their character
   depends on the extent to which numerical errors develop, as evidenced by
   the grid Peclet and Courant numbers.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial, statistical structure of the fluid velocity field in the
   case of uniformly recharged heterogeneous aquifers is investigated, and
   the spatial covariances of the velocity field are derived.  This
   information is necessary for an investigation of flow and
   macrodispersion using the Lagrangian formalism proposed by Dagan (1984).
   The resulting first two moments of the velocity are nonstationary.  They
   are functions of a parameter beta which characterizes the degree of flow
   nonuniformity and is related to the recharge.  The displacement
   variances are computed and tested favorably using numerical simulations.
   Simple relations are developed which relate the transport parameters
   found for the case of uniform-in-the-average flows to nonuniform flows
   using a simple, nonlinear transformation of the travel time, based on
   beta.}},

Abstract = {{Wetting front instability and gravity-driven fingers can occur during
   infiltration in sandy soil.  These soils overlay many major aquifers. 
   Finger width and velocity are important parameters in predicting the
   risk of groundwater pollution in these soils.  In previous studies,
   closed-form solutions were developed for air dry soil.  In uniformly wet
   soils, where the fingers are much wider, predictive finger width
   equations have failed so far.  In this paper we simplify further the
   Parlange-Hill closed-form solution for dry soil and show that, by taking
   hysteresis into account, it applies to fingers emanating from a point
   source in a sandy test soil at two widely different moisture contents.}},

Abstract = {{The skeletal matrix of an aquifer is known to move laterally toward a
   discharging well.  The mechanisms by which it moves relative to the well
   have been only partially studied in the past.  Examining the relation of
   drawdown to volume strain for an assumed poroelastic solid has been a
   common approach.  By way of contrast, the present study examines the
   relation of the velocity of solids (aquifer matrix) to their hydraulic
   driving forces.  The present approach can be considered Darcian and
   allows the displacement field of the aquifer matrix to be calculated
   directly.  A new formulation of the Darcy-Gersevanov law of water
   flowing relative to moving solids is applied to a Theis-Thiem confined
   aquifer.  The aquifer is found to start with a maximum velocity when the
   pump is turned on and then to decelerate as time progresses. 
   Dimensionless type curves of horizontal movement of the skeletal matrix
   are calculated.  The resulting equation of aquifer deformation is
   checked against (1) results from alternatively using the standard
   poroelastic stress-strain approach and (2) the fundamental storage
   equation for transient groundwater flow.}},

Abstract = {{The accuracy of the Darcy velocity, flux, and stream function computed
   from lowest-order, triangle-based, control volume and mixed finite
   element approximations to the two-dimensional pressure equation is
   considered. The control volume finite element method, similar to
   integrated finite difference methods and analogous to the interpolation
   of Galerkin finite element results over `'control volumes,'' is shown to
   yield a conservative velocity field and smooth streamlines. The
   streamlines and fluxes through the system computed with the control
   volume finite element approach are compared to those computed from the
   mixed finite element method, which approximates the pressure and
   velocity variables separately. It is shown that for systems with only
   moderates degrees of heterogeneity, the control volume finite element
   method is the more computationally efficient alternative; i.e., it
   provides more accurate flow results for a given number of unknowns. For
   more variable or discontinuous permeability fields, by contrast, such as
   sand/shale systems, the mixed finite element method is shown to
   approximate flow variables more accurately and more realistically than
   the control volume method with the same number of unknowns.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous and reliable velocity field is required for the simulation
   of mass and heat transport in an aquifer system.  In this paper, a
   cubic-spline technique is proposed to calculate nodal Darcian velocities
   after the flow field is obtained.  With this technique, a continuous
   velocity field is produced, and mass conservation is satisfied to an
   acceptable degree.  Its requirements for computer storage are very
   small, and the calculation speed is very fast; it can be implemented in
   parallel.  A synthetic diffusion problem is used to examine the accuracy
   of this technique.  The results agree very well with the analytical
   solution.  Application to another problem shows that this technique can
   be applied to any heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer.  The results of
   the two sample problems are also compared with the Galerkin finite
   element method {[}Yeh, 1981] and the dual mesh method {[}Batu, 1984]. 
   It is observed that its agreement with the Galerkin method is much
   better than the dual mesh method.}},

Abstract = {{Two- and three-component hydrograph separations based on O-18 and
   dissolved silica are used to investigate the contributions of glacial
   till water to the storm runoff of a headwater stream on the Canadian
   Shield.  Two-component isotopic hydrograph separations based on O-18
   indicate that the volume and flux of event water could be accounted for
   by direct precipitation onto saturated areas.  Three-component
   hydrograph separations distinguish between event water, preevent soil
   water, and preevent till water.  These results show that groundwater
   flow through coarse-textured glacial tills can make a significant
   contribution to stream discharge during runoff events (29 and 62\% in
   this study) despite the lower hydraulic conductivities of the tills
   compared to the overlying soils.  The three-component hydrograph
   separations also demonstrate that the relative contributions of preevent
   soil water and preevent till water changed during one runoff event such
   that the average water chemistry of the preevent component varied during
   the event.  Two-component hydrograph separations using dissolved silica
   indicate that seasonal changes in the till water contributions also
   occur and are related to groundwater levels.  Measurements of vertical
   hydraulic gradients during runoff events indicate that the increase in
   flow from the tills to the soils is minimal and cannot account for the
   large and rapid increase in till water flow into the stream.  Till water
   that has discharged to the soils prior to the event is probably being
   flushed from the soils into the stream during events.}},

Abstract = {{A previous study (Prevost et al., 1990) has shown that a lowering in the
   soil infiltrability index improves hydrograph snowmelt runoff peaks
   simulation of the Lac Laflamme basin.  The hypothesis that explains this
   phenomenon is as follows:  when the snowpack becomes discontinuous or
   thin during the spring, cold air temperatures during the night (< -
   10-degrees-C) freeze the water at the soil surface.  To test this
   hypothesis, four plots were instrumented to follow the evolution of
   water table fluctations, snow cover area, soil and air temperatures, and
   liquid and total contents at different levels in the soil.  Transect
   lines were also established to monitor snow depth, percentage of soil
   free of snow, and presence of basal ice and different types of soil
   frost (porous or concrete).  Our results show that the minimum nightly
   air temperature of - 5-degrees-C during snowmelt did not produce soil
   ice.  It was not possible to validate or invalidate the hypothesis.  The
   results of the survey at the basin scale show that concrete frost is
   prevalent throughout the basin, is associated with forest floors
   dominated by sphagnum or hypnobryale mosses, and originates from winter
   meteorological events.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for using satellite radar altimetry data to estimate the
   temporal variation of the water level in moderate to large lakes and
   enclosed seas is described.  Great Lakes data from the first 2 years of
   the U.S. Navy's Geosat Exact Repeat Mission (November 1986 to November
   1988), for which there is an improved orbit, are used to demonstrate the
   technique.  The Geosat results are compared to the lake level data
   collected by the Great Lakes Section, National Ocean Service, National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and are found to reproduce the
   temporal variations of the five major lakes with root-mean-square error
   (rms) ranging from 9.4 to 13.8 cm and a combined average of 11.1 cm. 
   Geosat data are also analyzed for Lake St. Clair, representing a
   moderate-sized lake, with a resulting rms of 17.0 cm.  During this study
   period, the water level in the Great Lakes varied in a typical annual
   cycle of about 0.2 m (0.5 m for Lake Ontario) superimposed on a general
   decline of approximately 0.5 m.  The altimeter data reproduced the
   general decline reasonably well for the lakes, but the annual cycle was
   obscured in some lakes due to systematic errors in the altimeter data. 
   Current and future altimetry missions will have markedly improved
   accuracy which will permit many moderate (25 km diameter) or larger
   lakes or enclosed seas to be routinely monitored.}},

Abstract = {{High-resolution digital elevation data from two small catchments in the
   western United States are used to examine the effect of digital
   elevation model (DEM) grid size on the portrayal of the land surface and
   hydrologic simulations.  Elevation data were gridded at 2-, 4-, 10-,
   30-, and 90-m scales to generate a series of simulated landscapes. 
   Frequency distributions of slope (tan B), drainage area per unit contour
   length (a), and the topographic index (a/tan B) were calculated for each
   grid size model.  Frequency distributions of a/tan B were then used in
   O'Loughlin's (1986) criterion for predicting zones of surface saturation
   and in TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979) for simulating hydrographs. 
   For both catchments, DEM grid size significantly affects computed
   topographic parameters and hydrographs.  While channel routing dominates
   hydrograph characteristics for large catchments, grid size effects
   influence physically based models of runoff generation and surface
   processes.  A 10-m grid size provides a substantial improvement over 30-
   and 90-m data, but 2- or 4-m data provide only marginal additional
   improvement for the moderately to steep gradient topography of our study
   areas.  Our analyses suggest that for many landscapes, a 10-m grid size
   presents a rational compromise between increase resolution and data
   volume for simulating geomorphic and hydrological processes.}},

Abstract = {{The realistic representation of terrain in hydrological models of
   fluvial landscapes poses problems particularly for representing
   convergence and divergence of lateral flows.  In this work we consider
   the topology of contour representation of surfaces.  The networks of
   ridge and drainage lines are linked at critical points:  peaks, saddles,
   confluences, and simple ridge junctions.  The properties of these points
   are given, and from these, three topologic rules are derived.  These are
   used to develop an automatic procedure for generating a catchment
   boundary and a modified flow net.  Use of the flow net increases speed
   by 2 orders of magnitude over earlier contour-based topographic
   analyses, and the use of topology increases speed, accuracy, and
   sophistication over a recent flow net technique.  Topology is used to
   evaluate simplifications of natural surfaces and, in particular, shows
   the unsuitability of the common ridge-to-stream rectangular flow strip. 
   Finally, implications for the structure of distributed catchment models
   and for designing and interpreting field experiments are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall simulation is a commonly used approach for studying runoff and
   erosion from forest roads, and a method is needed to estimate
   infiltration parameters from these experiments.  We used two algorithms,
   the Simplex and Shuffled Complex Evolution, to estimate parameters for a
   physically based infiltration and overland flow model.  Each algorithm
   was tested by estimating parameters for 92 field-measured hydrographs
   from forest roads.  Nine of the field-measured hydrographs allowed us to
   further test whether estimated parameters could be extended to other
   antecedent conditions and plot sizes.  The results demonstrate (1) the
   physically based model is able to estimate hydrographs from forest
   roads, (2) the two algorithms find unique parameter sets in spite of an
   error surface that suggests identifiability problems between the
   hydraulic conductivity and pressure parameters, (3) the two algorithms
   converged to the same parameter values, and (4) that parameters
   estimated for one antecedent condition and plot size can be extended to
   others with reasonably small error.}},

Abstract = {{The second stage of evaporation from a bare soil has been described in
   terms of the desorptivity, a parameter related to the soil's hydraulic

   accuracy established for the sorptivity (i.e., <1\% absolute relative
   error), the equivalent parameter for infiltration.  A new formula is

   Comparison with precise numerical solutions for exponential and power

Abstract = {{A physically based rainfall forecasting model for real-time hydrologic
   applications is developed with emphasis on utilization of remote sensing
   observations.  Temporal and spatial scales of interest are lead times of
   the order of hours and areas of the order of 10 km2.  The dynamic model
   is derived from conservation of mass in a cloud column as defined by the
   continuity equations for air, liquid water, water vapor, and cloud
   water.  Conservation of momentum is modeled using a semi-Lagrangian
   frame of reference.  The model state is vertically integrated liquid
   water content in a column of the atmosphere.  Additionally, laws of
   thermodynamics, adiabatic air parcel theory, and cloud microphysics are
   applied to derive a basic parameterization of the governing equations of
   model dynamics.  The parameterization is in terms of hydrometeorologic
   observables including radar reflectivity, satellite-infrared brightness
   temperature, and ground-level air temperature, dew point temperature,
   and pressure.  Implementation and application is described by French et
   al. (this issue) and involves incorporation of uncertainty analysis and
   a two-dimensional spatial domain, where the dynamics of the continuous
   space-time rainfall process are discretized onto a rectangular grid.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a real-time physically based rainfall forecasting
   model is examined using radar, satellite, and ground station data for a
   region of Oklahoma.  Model formulation is described in an accompanying
   paper (French and Krajewski, this issue).  Spatially distributed radar
   reflectivity observations are coupled with model physics and uncertainty
   analysis through (1) linearization of model dynamics and (2) a Kalman
   filter formulation.  Operationally available remote sensing observations
   from radar and satellite, and surface meteorologic stations define
   boundary conditions of the two-dimensional rainfall model.  The
   spatially distributed rainfall is represented by a two-dimensional field
   of cloud columns, and model physics define the evolution of vertically
   integrated liquid water content (the model state) in space and time. 
   Rainfall forecasts are evaluated using least squares criteria such as
   mean error of forecasted rainfall intensity, root mean square error of
   forecasted rainfall intensity, and correlation coefficient between
   spatially distributed forecasted and observed rainfall rates.  The model
   performs well compared with two alternative real-time forecasting
   strategies:  persistence and advection forecasting.}},

Abstract = {{Breakthrough of Cr(VI) (chromate), Se(VI) (selenate), and O2 (dissolved
   oxygen) was observed in tracer tests conducted in a shallow, sand and
   gravel aquifer with mildly reducing conditions. Loss of Cr, probably due
   to reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and irreversible sorption of Cr(III),
   occurred along with slight retardation of Cr(VI), owing to reversible
   sorption. Reduction of Se(VI) and O2 was thermodynamically feasible but
   did not occur, indicating conditions were unfavorable to microbial
   reduction. Cr(VI) reduction by constituents of aquifer sediments did not
   achieve local equilibrium during transport. The reduction rate was
   probably limited by incomplete contact between Cr(VI) transported along
   predominant flow paths and reductants located in regions within aquifer
   sediments of comparatively low permeability. Scatter in the amount of Cr
   reduction calculated from individual breakthrough curves at identical
   distances downgradient probably resulted from heterogeneities in the
   distribution of reductants in the sediments. Predictive modeling of the
   transport and fate of redox-sensitive solutes cannot be based strictly
   on thermodynamic considerations; knowledge of reaction rates is
   critical. Potentially important mass transfer rate limitations between
   solutes and reactants in sediments as well as heterogeneities in the
   distribution of redox properties in aquifers complicate determination of
   limiting rates for use in predictive simulations of the transport of
   redox-sensitive contaminants in groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{We present the development and demonstrate the use of the
   two-dimensional finite element code UNSATCHEM-2D for modeling major ion
   equilibrium and kinetic nonequilibrium chemistry in variably saturated
   porous media.  The model is intended for prediction of major ion
   chemistry and water and solute fluxes for soils under transient
   conditions.  Since the solution chemistry in the unsaturated zone is
   significantly influenced by variations in water content, temperature,
   and CO2 concentrations in the soil gas, all these variables are also
   calculated by the model.  The major variables of the chemical system are
   Ca, Mg, Na, K, SO4, Cl, NO3, alkalinity, and CO2.  The model accounts
   for equilibrium chemical reactions between these components such as
   complexation, cation exchange, and precipitation-dissolution.  For the
   precipitation-dissolution of calcite and dissolution of dolomite, either
   equilibrium or multicomponent kinetic expressions are used which include
   both forward and back reactions.  Other dissolution-precipitation
   reactions considered include gypsum, hydromagnesite, and nesquehonite. 
   Since the ionic strength of soil solutions can often reach high values,
   both modified Debye-Huckel and Pitzer expressions were incorporated into
   the model to calculate single ion activities.  The need for an iterative
   coupling procedure between the solute transport and chemical modules is
   demonstrated with an example which considers root water uptake and
   irrigation using moderately saline water.  The utility of the model is
   further illustrated with two-dimensional simulations with surface and
   subsurface irrigation from a line source.}},

Abstract = {{Building flood control rule curves (FCRC) for multipurpose
   multireservoir systems involves treating simultaneously the
   stochasticity of future inflows and the multivariate aspect of the
   problem.  The study demonstrates how theoretical findings concerning
   flood control multireservoir systems regulation obtained by Marien
   (1984) (the so-called controllability conditions) can be used to build
   generalized FCRC in multipurpose multireservoir systems.  These FCRC are
   generalized FCRC in the sense that they consist of a time varying
   constraint set on the needed empty space provisions in the different
   reservoirs of the system.  The applicability of the proposed technique
   is enhanced by the derivation of new controllability conditions for
   systems with more than one flood control section and mandatory releases.
   By means of several examples, it is shown how the proposed methodology
   is superior to the approach which consists of lumping all the reservoirs
   of the system into a single imaginary reservoir.  A practical example
   with an eight-reservoir hydropower system in Brazil demonstrates the
   applicability of the methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering design, optimal operation, evaluation of performance, and
   benefit-cost analysis of a local flood warning system require an
   explicit and extensive characterization of uncertainties in terms of
   probability distributions.  Such a characterization is obtained via a
   Bayesian Processor of Forecasts (BPF) which provides (1) a prior
   description of uncertainty about flood occurrence and crest height, (2)
   a stochastic characterization of the forecaster in terms of likelihood
   functions, and (3) a posterior description of uncertainty about flood
   occurrence and crest height, conditional on a flood crest forecast.  The
   theoretical novelty of our BPF is that a posterior distribution can be
   constructed for any prior distribution, parametric or nonparametric, the
   generality essential in light of the variety of models used as flood
   crest distributions.  The conceptual novelty of the BPF opens a new
   research paradigm (which provides distributions for real-time decision
   making based on forecasts) that adjoins the classical flood frequency
   analysis (which has provided probability distributions for planning and

Abstract = {{A model for the topographic influence on shallow landslide initiation is
   developed by coupling digital terrain data with near-surface through
   flow and slope stability models.  The hydrologic model TOPOG
   (O'Loughlin, 1986) predicts the degree of soil saturation in response to
   a steady state rainfall for topographic elements defined by the
   intersection of contours and flow tube boundaries.  The slope stability
   component uses this relative soil saturation to analyze the stability of
   each topographic element for the case of cohesionless soils of spatially
   constant thickness and saturated conductivity.  The steady state
   rainfall predicted to cause instability in each topographic element
   provides a measure of the relative potential for shallow landsliding. 
   The spatial distribution of critical rainfall values is compared with
   landslide locations mapped from aerial photographs and in the field for
   three study basins where high-resolution digital elevation data are
   available:  Tennessee Valley in Marin County, California; Mettman Ridge
   in the Oregon Coast Range; and Split Creek on the Olympic Peninsula,
   Washington.  Model predictions in each of these areas are consistent
   with spatial patterns of observed landslide scars, although hydrologic
   complexities not accounted for in the model (e.g., spatial variability
   of soil properties and bedrock flow) control specific sites and timing
   of debris flow initiation within areas of similar topographic control.}},

Abstract = {{Burial of transported material in gravel bed rivers was examined using
   several hundred magnetically tagged particles.  Burial depth of
   individual particles varies with no simple relation to particle size. 
   Distributions of burial depth of particles were examined by considering
   observed burial depth of individual size groups of all mobile particles
   and of all tagged particles (including static ones).  `'Simple''
   (single-peak) flow events yielded exponential distributions of burial
   depth of mobile particles.  Distributions with secondary peaks were
   obtained from large and multipeak events.  Season long results were skew
   peaked with a tendency toward uniformity.  An m-layer model is developed
   to account for the variation of frequency of burial depth of particles,
   based on the assumptions that the burial depth of particles in a simple
   event is exponentially distributed and the proportion of particles which
   change vertical position from a given layer is constant from event to
   event.  The model is elaborated for varying mixing rates, varying scour
   depths, and variable behavior of different size classes.  After many
   events the material is uniformly distributed throughout all layers, in
   conformity with field experience.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of water salinity, soil sodicity, and raindrop energy on
   final infiltration rate, wash erosion, and soil particle splash of two
   kaolinitic soils (ustochrepts and paleudalf) was studied.  Final
   infiltration rate decreased with the increase in soil sodicity and drop
   energy and increased with the increase of water salinity.  Wash erosion
   and splash increased with the increase in soil sodicity and drop energy
   and decreased with the increase in water salinity.  Infiltration was
   very sensitive to relatively low drop energy.  The major decrease in
   final infiltration rate was already achieved at drop energies lower than
   10 J mm-1 m-2.  Wash erosion increased exponentially with the increase
   in drop energy compared to a linear increase of the splash.  Soil splash
   was approximately 2-3 times higher than wash erosion for any given drop
   energy.  The threshold energy for soil splash initiation was 4-6 J mm-1
   m-2, while for wash erosion (low exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP))
   it was 2-4 J mm-1 m-2, and for the high ESP it was beyond the lowest
   energy we used (2.1 J mm-1 m-2).}},

Abstract = {{A water-saturated fracture, partially clogged with porous material
   coating the fracture surfaces, is considered.  Fluid flow and
   contaminant transport in this fracture are significantly altered
   relative to an unclogged fracture.  Analytical expressions are developed
   for the water velocities in the clogged and the unclogged regions in the
   fracture and the asymptotic longitudinal dispersion coefficient for the
   system.  For highly adsorbing dissolved contaminants or large colloids,
   the slow diffusion within the porous region causes enhanced dispersion. 
   In a standard tracer test, colloidal contaminants will arrive earlier
   than dissolved tracers for either one of two reasons:  (1) colloids
   confined to the unclogged portion of the fracture will have a larger
   average velocity or (2) colloids that can diffuse into the porous region
   have very low Brownian diffusivities, resulting in a large longitudinal
   dispersion due to the inverse relationship between Taylor dispersion and
   Brownian diffusion.  The average velocity or asymptotic longitudinal
   dispersion coefficient can be orders of magnitude greater than that for
   a molecular tracer.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of distributed rainfall data and
   computational resources is providing the opportunity to use distributed
   models for rainfall-runoff forecasting or other applications. This paper
   compares the accuracy of simulations from a complex distributed model
   (KINEROS), a simple distributed model (based on the Soil Conservation
   Service (SCS) method), and a simple lumped model (SCS method). The 150
   km2, semiarid Walnut Gulch experimental watershed was the test site;
   models were validated using 24 severe thunderstorms and rain gauge
   densities similar to those found at flash flood warning sites (one gauge
   per 20 km2). Under these circumstances, none of the models were able to
   accurately simulate peak flows or runoff volumes from individual events.
   Models showed somewhat more skill in predicting time to peak and the
   ratio of peak flow to volume. When calibration was performed, the
   accuracy of the complex distributed model was similar to that of the
   simple distributed model. Without calibration, the complex distributed
   model was more accurate than the simple distributed model. The spatially
   lumped model performed very poorly. The complex distributed model was
   validated under real-time forecasting conditions; forecasts based on
   observed rainfall had lead times of 30-75 min.}},

Abstract = {{Early theoretical investigations into initiation of limestone cave
   development suggested that water entering small fractures approaches
   saturation within a short distance and thus appeared to be unable to
   produce much further enlargement of these fractures. The answer to this
   problem seems to be White's (1977) `'kinetic trigger'' idea, emphasizing
   the precipitous drop in dissolution rates as equilibrium is approached.
   However, minimum conditions of flow rate, passage geometry, and initial
   CO2 concentration may exist, below which the waters will so nearly
   achieve saturation that caves will be unable to develop. Modeling
   results indicate that under geologically reasonable PCO2 and head
   gradient values, the minimum initial aperture widths in which caves will
   develop is of the order of 100 mum. Initial apertures wider than about
   500 mum will form passages very easily, even under low head gradients.
   There will thus be strong differential selection among initial flow
   paths with regard to cavern passage development.}},

Abstract = {{Data from FIFE (the First International Satellite Land Surface
   Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment) were used in an
   atmospheric boundary layer bulk similarity formulation to derive values
   of the friction velocity, u{*} (i.e., the shear stress), from surface
   geostrophic wind measurements under unstable conditions. Several
   stability-dependent forms for the similarity functions B (corresponding
   to the x direction geostrophic wind, u(g)) and B(w) (corresponding to
   the scalar geostrophic wind speed, G) were tested. Formulations to
   calculate u{*} from G were more successful than those which used only
   u(g). However, the dependency of B, B(w), or the geostrophic drag
   coefficient, C(G) = mu{*}/G, on either stability or baroclinicity was
   observed to be relatively weak. For FIFE, a constant value of B(w) =
   1.99 agreed with the reference u{*} values almost as well as the best
   stability-dependent formulations. A constant value Of C(G) = 0.0883,
   used with measured values of G, gave an unbiased estimate of u{*}, on

Abstract = {{Great Lakes hydrologic research requires the use of
   continuous-simulation daily ice cover models over long time periods in
   the absence of field observations. They must be physically based, rather
   than statistically based, for use under conditions different than those
   under which they were derived. But they also must match existing
   conditions for which data exist. A review discloses that existing ice
   dynamics models do not meet all of these criteria; a new one that does
   is based here on a prismatic ice pack heat balance, ice growth and
   temperature constraints, and thermodynamic flux terms from companion
   water heat balance and storage equations. The prismatic ice model is a
   good first step to understanding complex geometries and is supportable
   through the use of lake-averaged energy fluxes. The ice model is
   integrated into an existing lake thermodynamics and one-dimensional heat
   storage model, and the resulting combination is calibrated for
   Laurentian Great Lakes applications. Simulation experiments are used to
   analyze the model's strengths and limitations and to explore its
   relevance. Comparisons between model output and existing data allow
   consideration of the ice climatology of the Great Lakes; the climatology
   description is extended through use of the new model. Promising
   potential model extensions include spatial extension, additional
   parameterizations for wind-ice movement, snow, and albedo, and
   inclusions of remotely sensed data.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements from a rectangular grid of thermistors set in a maritime
   snowpack are used to study the infiltration of water during two
   midwinter rain on snow events. The progress of wetting is tracked in
   real time by monitoring changes in the position of the zero-degree
   isotherm. Rates and patterns of infiltration are calculated for each
   event. Infiltration was not uniform, and water penetrated through
   localized channels that often occupied less than 50\% of the total
   volume of the snowpack. The evolution of wetting was strongly influenced
   by the snow stratigraphy. In one case the snowpack contained multiple
   ice layers, and vertical flow was impeded and diverted laterally for
   several hours at each layer. In the other case the snowpack was more
   homogeneous, and water concentrated in channels and penetrated to depth
   more rapidly. The measurements of temperature are also used to calculate
   the components of heat transfer within the snow during each rain event.
   Heat transfer in dry snow occurs primarily by conduction, and rates are
   relatively slow. However, introduction of liquid water results in the
   release of latent heat when water freezes on contact with subfreezing
   snow at the wetting front. The release of latent heat dominates heat
   transfer and has the potential to warm the snowpack rapidly. Rates of
   freezing needed to satisfy the heat equation are calculated. In both
   cases studied, less than 4\% of the total influx of rainwater needed to
   change phase. Most of the rain remained liquid and wet the snow or
   drained through the snowpack.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal variability of rainfall and raindrop processes is examined
   at time scales ranging from less than 1 min to 1 hour. Raindrop
   processes are represented in terms of drop arrival rate, mean diameter,
   and coefficient of variation of drop diameter and modeled as
   time-varying stochastic processes. It is shown that rainfall rate and
   accumulated rainfall have simple and accurate representations in terms
   of raindrop processes. Using these results the temporal variability of
   rainfall rate is examined in terms of temporal variability of raindrop
   processes. It is shown that the temporal variability of rainfall rate
   varies systematically across a range of climatic settings and, more
   importantly, that these climatic contrasts in rainfall rate can be
   related to contrasting properties of raindrop processes. Two statistical
   models of rainfall rate and raindrop processes are examined in detail: a
   lognormal model with fixed parameters and a lognormal model with
   parameters that vary from storm to storm. Temporal correlation structure
   of rainfall rate exhibits qualitatively different behaviour under the
   two models. Lognormal models of rainfall rate are extended to models in
   which dependence on the averaging time interval is explicitly
   represented. Scale properties of rainfall rate are examined empirically
   for averaging time intervals ranging from 1 min to 30 min. Empirical
   analyses are based on drop-size data from North Carolina, New Jersey,
   Oregon, Alaska, and the Marshall Islands.}},

Abstract = {{A dimensionless formulation of the acceleration terms of the
   Saint-Venant equations is presented for one-dimensional overland flows
   under either laminar or turbulent conditions. For stationary storms over
   a plane surface of uniform roughness, dimensionless analytical
   expressions are derived during the rising limb for the local
   acceleration a(l){*}, and during equilibrium for the convective
   acceleration a(c){*} and the pressure gradient a(p){*} ((13), (14), and
   (15), respectively). In terms of the order of magnitude, the three
   acceleration terms are inversely proportional to the kinematic flow
   number K. At equilibrium, the pressure gradient a(p){*} is also
   inversely proportional to the square of the Froude number Fr. The
   relative magnitude of the acceleration terms for supercritical overland
   flow (a(l){*} > a(c){*} > a(p){*}) differs from subcritical overland
   flow (a(p){*} > a(l){*} > a(c){*}), which in all cases contrasts with
   open-channel flows (a(p){*} > a(c){*} > a(l){*}). The kinematic wave
   approximation is therefore only suitable when both K and Fr are large.
   Improvements using the diffusive wave approximation are only possible
   for subcritical overland flow. Both the diffusive wave and the
   quasi-steady dynamic wave approximations are not suitable for
   supercritical overland flow. The analysis of moving storms corroborates
   these findings in that the local acceleration exceeds the convective
   acceleration. These effects are particularly pronounced during the
   rising limb of overland flow hydrographs for downstream moving
   rainstorms.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the spatial variability of conductivity within the
   sandstone Wabiskaw member of the Lower Cretaceous, Middle Mannville in
   the Alberta Basin. The Wabiskaw is an important regional
   hydrostratigraphic unit. Vertical variability within the aquifer is
   characterized by downhole variograms of log conductivity from core
   measurements. They are found to exhibit pseudoperiodic structures due to
   alternating sand and shale layers. Horizontal spatial variability is
   characterized using variograms of log transmissivity and indicator data.
   These variograms show a steady increase in spatial variability over
   length scales ranging from 400 m to 100 km, characteristic of
   self-similar or fractal behavior. They also reveal distinct correlation
   structures related to both high and low transmissivity depositional
   features. This study also considers the upscaling of conductivity
   vertically, from the core to the well scale, and horizontally, from the
   well to the basin scale. It is shown that traditional vertical upscaling
   of conductivities by arithmetic averaging causes an overestimation of
   transmissivity in two-dimensional areal flow models. An alternative
   approach, based on power averaging, is proposed. Transmissivities
   derived by vertical upscaling of core measurements are compared with
   values derived from drill-stem tests in the same well. No correlation
   between these quantities is observed. An average transmissivity for the
   Wabiskaw in the study area is determined by geometric spatial averaging;
   however, the highly clustered spatial distribution of well locations
   requires a weighting of sample values using ordinary kriging.}},

Abstract = {{The flowmeter test, when modified, can be applied long before the well
   response reaches a quasi-steady state. In many practical applications
   the traditional flowmeter test provides only an order of magnitude
   estimate of the hydraulic conductivity distribution. Conducting the
   double flowmeter test, i.e., running the flowmeter test on the same
   borehole twice (at appropriate times), improves the accuracy of the
   estimated downhole distribution of the hydraulic conductivity and, in
   addition, provides the downhole distribution of the specific
   storativity. Formulae for the hydraulic conductivity and specific
   storativity of each layer are derived for a case of a layered aquifer.
   The accuracy of the estimated parameter distributions is evaluated via a
   first-order sensitivity analysis. A formula is also found for the
   equivalent specific storativity of a layered aquifer. In addition, it is
   shown that accounting for well bore storage in the flowmeter test leads
   to an inconsistent model, and hence the flowmeter test should be
   conducted only after well bore storage effects disappear.}},

Abstract = {{The size, shape, and arrangement of structured voids 1-10 mm in size
   play an important role in the transport of water and solutes through
   soil. However, these characteristics are complex and difficult to
   quantify. Improved methods are needed to quantify the characteristics of
   these voids to better understand and predict the behavior of water and
   solutes passing through them. This study applied fractal analysis to
   soil bulk density data measured by X ray computed tomography (CT), a
   relatively new tool for nondestructively measuring macropore-scale
   density in soil cores. Studies were conducted using undisturbed soil
   cores (7.6 cm ID) from forested and cultivated sites in the A horizon of
   a Menfro silt loam soil containing macropores and using two groups of
   soil cores which were uniformly packed with Menfro aggregates from 1-2
   mm in diameter for one group and < 1 mm in diameter for the other group.
   Samples were probed using CT to produce a 512 by 512 digital matrix of
   CT pixel values corresponding to bulk density. Pixels above a specified
   CT `'cutoff'' value were designated as occupied. A box-counting method
   was used to find the fractal dimension of the perimeters between
   occupied and unoccupied pixels and of the areas formed by the unoccupied
   pixels. For length scales from 1 to 10 mm, perimeters and areas of these
   regions appeared to be fractal systems. Single degree of freedom
   orthogonal contrast tests determined from analysis of variance showed
   significant differences between the fractal dimension for (1) forest and
   cultivated cores versus uniformly packed cores, (2) two groups of
   uniformly packed cores made of different aggregate sizes, and (3) forest
   versus cultivated cores.}},

Abstract = {{Most analytical formulas used to model moisture retention in unsaturated
   porous media have been developed for the wet range and are unsuitable
   for applications in which low water contents are important. We have
   developed two models that fit the entire range from saturation to oven
   dryness in a practical and physically realistic way with smooth,
   continuous functions that have few parameters. Both models incorporate a
   power law and a logarithmic dependence of water content on suction,
   differing in how these two components are combined. In one model,
   functions are added together (model `'sum''); in the other they are
   joined smoothly together at a discrete point (model `'junction''). Both
   models also incorporate recent developments that assure a continuous
   derivative and force the function to reach zero water content at a
   finite value of suction that corresponds to oven dryness. The models
   have been tested with seven sets of water retention data that each cover
   nearly the entire range. The three-parameter sum model fits all data
   well and is useful for extrapolation into the dry range when data for it
   are unavailable. The two-parameter junction model fits most data sets
   almost as well as the sum model and has the advantage of being
   analytically integrable for convenient use with capillary-bundle models
   to obtain the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Soil physics parameters were monitored in a semiarid site in the
   Chihuahuan Desert of Texas to evaluate unsaturated flow processes under
   natural conditions. The bed of an ephemeral stream was instrumented with
   neutron probe access tubes to monitor water content for 3 years and with
   thermocouple psychrometers to monitor water potential and temperature
   for 2 years. Soil samples were collected from stream and interstream
   settings for laboratory measurement of water content, water potential,
   water retention, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. Absence of
   temporal variations in water content in deep (41-m) profiles indicated
   that within the accuracy of the neutron probe measurements, water pulses
   were not moving through the system. Penetration of water after rainfall
   was generally restricted to the uppermost 0.2 m of the sediments. During
   rain-free periods, the surficial sediments were extremely dry, as
   indicated by laboratory-measured water potentials as low as -16 MPa.
   After rainfall, water potentials were highest at the surface and
   decreased sharply at the base of the wetting front, with gradients as
   steep as -13 MPa in 0.05 m. Water potentials were out of range of the in
   situ psychrometers down to 0.8 m throughout most of the monitoring
   period because the soils were very dry (less-than-or-equal-to -7 to -8
   MPa). Seasonal fluctuations in water potential were recorded at depths
   of 1. 1 and 1.4 m. Water potentials at greater depths remained fairly
   uniform with time. Except in the shallow subsurface after rainfall,
   water potentials generally decreased upward; this trend indicated an
   upward driving force for liquid and isothermal vapor movement. Soil
   temperatures displayed large seasonal and diurnal fluctuations.
   Temperatures generally increased with depth in the winter and decreased
   with depth in the summer. Downward summer temperature gradients opposed
   upward water potential gradients and resulted in a downward driving
   force for thermal vapor movement.}},

Abstract = {{Transient one-dimensional fluxes of soil water (liquid and vapor) and
   heat in response to 1 year of atmospheric forcing were simulated
   numerically for a site in the Chihuahuan Desert of Texas. The model was
   initialized and evaluated using the monitoring data presented in a
   companion paper (Scanlon, this issue). Soil hydraulic and thermal
   properties were estimated a priori from a combination of laboratory
   measurements, models, and other published information. In the first
   simulation, the main drying curves were used to describe soil water
   retention, and hysteresis was ignored. Remarkable consistency was found
   between computed and measured water potentials and temperatures.
   Attenuation and phase shift of the seasonal cycle of water potentials
   below the shallow subsurface active zone (0.0- to 0.3-m depth) were
   similar to those of temperatures, suggesting that water potential
   fluctuations were driven primarily by temperature changes. Water fluxes
   in the upper 0.3 m of soil were dominated by downward and upward liquid
   fluxes that resulted from infiltration of rain and subsequent
   evaporation from the surface. Upward flux was vapor dominated only in
   the top several millimeters of the soil during periods of evaporation.
   Below a depth of 0.3 m, water fluxes varied slowly and were dominated by
   downward thermal vapor flux that decreased with depth, causing a net
   accumulation of water. In a second simulation, nonhysteretic water
   retention was instead described by the estimated main wetting curves;
   the resulting differences in fluxes were attributed to lower initial
   water contents (given fixed initial water potential) and unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivities that were lower than they were in the first
   simulation. Below a depth of 0.3 m, the thermal vapor fluxes dominated
   and were similar to those in the first simulation. Two other simulations
   were performed, differing from the first only in the prescription of
   different (wetter) initial water potentials. These three simulations
   yielded identical solutions in the upper 0.2 m of soil after
   infiltration of summer rain; however, the various initial water
   potentials were preserved throughout the year at depths greater than 0.2
   m. Comparison of all four simulations showed that the predominantly
   upward liquid fluxes below a depth of 0.2 m were very sensitive to the
   differences in water retention functions and initial water potentials
   among simulations, because these factors strongly affected hydraulic
   conductivities. Comparison of numerical modeling results with chemical
   tracer data showed that values of downward vapor flux below the surface
   evaporation zone were of the same order of magnitude as those previously
   estimated by analysis of depth distributions of bomb H-3 (volatile) and
   bomb Cl-36 (nonvolatile).}},

Abstract = {{The statistics of chloride transport through 29 undisturbed soil
   monoliths (20 cm in diameter and 1 m long, sampled from a field plot of
   15 x 175 m2) were evaluated in a controlled laboratory experiment.
   Although the field soil (loamy sand) was relatively homogeneous with
   regard to texture, the individual monoliths showed large and irregular
   variability in their soil characteristics and in their flow and
   transport properties. The distribution of the specific discharge of
   water could be quantified by a bimodal distribution; the horizontal
   correlation length for the specific discharge of water was estimated to
   about 10 m. The ratio between the arrival time of the peak in chloride
   concentration and the water residence time given by the measured flow
   parameters indicated a mobile water content that was smaller than the
   measured water content. The large variability in hydraulic conductivity
   in both the vertical and horizontal direction, and the agreement between
   the present hydraulic conductivity measurements and earlier measurements
   in the field area, indicate that the partition of the measured water
   content between mobile and relatively immobile water was an effect of
   the soil structure rather than a boundary effect.}},

Abstract = {{The observed statistics of chloride breakthrough presented by Sassner et
   al. (this issue) were compared with predictions of a
   stochastic-advective modeling approach. The stochastic-advective model
   based on the observed spatial distribution of flow rates and on
   transport parameters consistent with parameter values obtained from
   local breakthrough curves (BTCs) agreed well with the observations.
   Alternative models that agreed well with the local BTCs failed to
   predict the large-scale BTC with realistic parameter values. The results
   support the assumption that compared to advection variability, local
   dispersion within the mobile water will often have a second-order effect
   on field scale solute transport. The stochastic-advective model is
   robust with regard to the rate of mass transfer between mobile and
   immobile water zones. This robustness implies that order of magnitude
   estimates may be sufficient for providing useful predictions of both
   field scale solute transport and the associated prediction uncertainty.
   In contrast, accurate estimation of the statistics of solute advection
   at the scale of interest for the transport problem is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Neglecting local solute dispersion, we prove that under realistic
   conditions the ensemble moments of the local concentration satisfy a
   mean convection dispersion equation (CDE) for both conservative and
   instantaneously adsorbing solutes, provided that the solute velocity
   field is stochastically stationary. Thus the same algorithm can be used
   to model the ensemble mean concentration and its uncertainty. For
   uniform initial conditions the solution of the mean CDE contains all the
   information about the local concentration probability distribution
   function, which is not Gaussian. The governing equation for k-point
   ensemble moments of the concentration is similar in form to the mean
   CDE, with the same effective dispersion coefficient and convective
   velocity. The special case of an impulse initial condition is used to
   illustrate that volume averaging can significantly change the
   concentration coefficient of variation except at the plume front. The
   persistence in the longitudinal direction of concentration moments and
   concentration k-point moments is caused by large longitudinal
   megadispersion. Finally, it is suggested that `'ergodicity'' should be
   interpreted operationally in terms of an acceptably small coefficient of
   variation of the concentration field so that this concept can be applied
   to experimental field data.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of water saturation on the transport of a conservative,
   nonreactive solute pulse by quasi steady state and transient flows in a
   vertical cross section of a hypothetical, yet realistic heterogeneous,
   partially saturated soil has been analyzed here by a series of numerical
   experiments. Mean water saturation in the flow domain was controlled by
   predetermined capillary pressure head at the entry zone, or by
   predetermined time interval between successive water applications.
   Analyses of the simulation results show that under both quasi steady
   state and transient flow regimes, lower degree of water saturation
   enhances solute spreading, in qualitative agreement with the results of
   Lagrangian-stochastic analyses of vadose-zone transport {[}Russo, 1993a,
   b]. The pattern of the velocity field, and, consequently, the spreading
   of the solute body, were affected considerably by the boundary
   conditions imposed on the flow at the entry zone. In the case of the
   quasi steady state flows under predetermined capillary pressure head at
   the inlet zone, the flow was essentially unidirectional vertical, with
   slight local derivations and, consequently, solute spreading took place
   mainly in the longitudinal direction. In the case of transient flows
   under periodic influx, the flow pattern was more complicated,
   essentially two dimensional, thereby restricting the longitudinal
   spreading of the solute plume and enhancing its transverse spreading. In
   the companion paper (Russo et al., this issue), integrated measures of
   the simulated solute plumes are compared with their predicted values,
   based on the first-order Lagrangian-stochastic analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of results of Lagrangian-stochastic analyses of
   vadose-zone transport {[}Russo, 1993a, b] to realistic situations is
   investigated using results of detailed numerical simulations of
   transport in a hypothetical, yet realistic heterogeneous, partially
   saturated soil, obtained in the first companion paper (Russo et al.,
   this issue) for both quasi steady state and transient, nonmonotonic
   flows. For both flow regimes, lower mean water saturation and longer
   travel time are shown to increase solute spreading, while lower water
   saturation and smaller travel distance are shown to increase the skewing
   of mean solute breakthrough curves. Solute plumes associated with the
   latter flow regimes, however, exhibit less spreading in the longitudinal
   direction and more spreading in the transverse direction, while the
   respective breakthrough curves are less skewed and less erratic, as
   compared with solute spreading and breakthrough associated with the
   former flow regimes. Components of the time-dependent displacement
   covariance tensor, X and expected solute flux through a given horizontal
   control plane {[}s], based on the Lagrangian-stochastic analyses,
   compared favorably with estimates of X and {[}s] obtained from the
   simulated transport under quasi steady state, essentially unidirectional
   flows, but failed to predict estimates of X and {[}s] obtained from the
   simulated transport under transient, nonmonotonic, multidirectional
   flows. The latter can be predicted by a particle-tracking method
   {[}Rubin, 1990] that allows for deviation of the solute particles from
   their mean path, provided that the pertinent flow regime is quantifiable
   in terms of an appropriate velocity covariance function.}},

Title = {{NONREACTIVE AND REACTIVE SOLUTE TRANSPORT IN 3-DIMENSIONAL HETEROGENEOUS

Abstract = {{The field-scale transport of reactive and nonreactive solutes by
   groundwater in a statistically anisotropic aquifer is examined by means
   of high-resolution, three-dimensional numerical solutions of the steady
   state flow and transient advection-dispersion equations. The presence of
   physical and chemical heterogeneities in the aquifer media is modeled
   with the use of a geostatistical description of the hydraulic
   conductivity and chemical distribution coefficient. The geostatistical
   parameters describing the spatial variations of the log-transformed
   hydraulic conductivity fields, In {[}K(x)], are chosen to resemble those
   of the Borden aquifer. For sorbing solutes the spatial variation in the
   log-transformed distribution coefficient fields, ln {[}K(d)(x)], is
   generated so as to have a geometric mean and variance similar to that
   estimated by Durant (1986) for the organic chemical tetrachlorethane
   with Borden sand. It is further assumed that the In {[}K(x)] and In
   {[}K(d)(X)] fields are inversely correlated to each other and that they
   possess the same spatial correlation structure. Five realizations of
   media which incorporate these characteristics are generated by means of
   the Fourier spectral technique of Robin et al. (1993). It is shown that
   joint K(x) and K(d)(X) variability can impart a large-scale
   `'pseudokinetic'' behavior, in that the ensemble mean bulk retardation
   factor can increase with time and plume displacement distance, even
   though sorption is modeled as being linear and instantaneous at the
   scale of any single heterogeneity and the flow field is assumed to be
   steady state. From realization to realization, however, the apparent
   bulk retardation factor can either increase dramatically at early time
   in a manner similar to that observed by Roberts et al. (1986) during the
   Borden tracer test or it can decrease. At large time the ensemble mean
   velocity of the centroid of the reactive plume is close to a value given
   by the mean fluid velocity divided by the arithmetic mean of the locally
   variable retardation factors. Local-scale transport nonidealities, such
   as intraparticle diffusion and relatively rapid kinetic sorption, are
   shown to have minimal influence on the plume centroid velocity and
   macrodispersivity, relative to the effect of aquifer heterogeneity. The
   results of the numerical simulations further demonstrate that the
   first-order stochastic analyses of Gelhar and Axness (1983), Dagan
   (1988), and Naff (1990) tend to overestimate the actual field-scale
   longitudinal spreading of a nonreactive solute. This result is believed
   to occur because these analyses include the artificial effect of plume
   centroid dispersion about the ensemble mean position, in addition to the
   actual spreading of each plume realization about its center of mass.
   When the effect of plume centroid dispersion is added to the numerical
   simulation results, a reasonable agreement with the solution of Naff
   (1990), which takes into consideration local-scale dispersion, is
   obtained for the longitudinal macrodispersivity. In the transverse
   direction, the ensemble mean spreading agrees reasonably well with the
   solution of Dagan (1988). It is also shown that the longitudinal
   macrodispersivity of a reactive solute can be enhanced relative to that
   of a nonreactive one. Its actual value, however, is overpredicted by the
   first-order solution of Garabedian (1987) for the reasons given above.
   Also explored, in a preliminary fashion, are some issues related to
   prediction uncertainty for both reactive and nonreactive solutes
   migrating through heterogeneous aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{The embedding optimization modeling approach is adapted to aid
   sustainable groundwater quantity and quality management of complex
   nonlinear multilayer aquifers. Implicit block-centered finite difference
   approximations of the quasi three-dimensional unsteady flow equation and
   Galerkin finite element approximations of the two-dimensional
   advection-dispersion transport equation are embedded directly as
   constraints in the model. Also used are nonlinear constraints describing
   river-aquifer interflow, evapotranspiration, and vertical flow reduction
   due to unconfinement. These circumvent use of large numbers of integer
   variables. The use of both linear and nonlinear formulations in a
   cyclical manner reduces execution time and improves confidence in
   solution optimality. The methodology is demonstrated for Salt Lake
   valley where groundwater quantity and quality management are needed, the
   proportion of pumping cells and cells needing head constraint is large,
   and many flows are described by discrete nonlinear or piecewise linear
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two methods for approximating the optimal

   The first method employs a policy iteration dynamic programming (DP)
   algorithm where the value function is estimated by Monte Carlo
   simulation combined with curve-fitting techniques. The second method
   uses a Taylor series approximation to the functional equation of DP
   which reduces the problem, for a given observed state, to solving a
   system of equations equal in number to the aquifers. The methods are
   compared using a four-state variable, stochastic dynamic programming
   model of Madera County, California. The two methods yield nearly
   identical estimates of the optimal pumping policy, as well as the steady
   state pumping depth, suggesting that either method can be used in
   similar applications.}},

Abstract = {{The permeability of argillaceous formations, although rarely measured
   and poorly understood, is commonly a critical parameter in analyses of
   Subsurface flow. Data now available suggest a regular relation between
   permeability and porosity in clays and shale's and permeabilities that,
   even at large scales, are significantly lower than usually assumed.
   Permeabilities between 10(-23) and 10(-17) m(2) have been obtained at
   Porosities between 0.1 and 0.4 in both laboratory and regional studies.
   Although it is clear that transmissive fractures or other
   heterogeneities control the large-scale hydraulic behavior of certain
   argillaceous units, the permeability of many others is apparently scale
   independent. These results have significant implications for
   understanding fluid transport rates and abnormal pressure generation in
   basins, and could prove important for waste isolation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{A general relationship between the contributing area, slope, and mean
   elevation of catchments with relief declining after a tectonic uplift
   event is presented. This relationship is based on the continuity
   equation for runoff and erosion processes in the catchment. The key
   hypothesis underlying this relationship is that as a catchment declines,
   the nondimensionalized catchment approaches a constant form. This
   hypothesis is verified for computer simulated catchments. The
   area-slope-elevation relationship covers several cases: catchments
   declining toward a peneplain; catchments declining from a high slope
   dynamic equilibrium (resulting from a high rate of tectonic uplift) to a
   low slope one (resulting from a lower rate bf tectonic uplift); and
   catchments declining from an elevated initial condition, as, for
   example, in the decline of a mine spoil heap. A previously published
   relationship between slope and area for catchments in dynamic
   equilibrium and based on runoff and erosion physics is shown to be a
   special case of this general relationship. The new area-slope-elevation
   relationship is compared with data from simulated catchments and a field
   catchment. It is thus shown that for declining catchments the
   area-slope-elevation relationship is a good predictor of catchment form
   for catchments with declining relief. It is argued that the
   slope-area-elevation relationship is sufficient, with the planiform
   drainage pattern, to completely define the elevation properties of the
   catchment such as, for instance, the hypsometric curve.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of samples of visually classified channel networks are
   taken from some published works. The samples are representative of the
   following pattern types: dendritic, parallel, rectangular, trellis; and
   pinnate. By means of computer techniques, essential parameters of
   elements of these pattern samples are determined. These include lengths,
   directions, and degrees of curvedness and meandering of channel
   segments, as well as confluence angles. The parameters are used to
   determine pattern attributes such as density, texture, parallelism,
   rectangularity, and bifurcation ratios. Thresholds are generated for the
   attributes and used in the construction of classification models for the
   five pattern types studied. The processes and models are coded in a
   computer program for use in the automated classification Of numerically
   valued channel networks. After classification the image is displayed
   with each individual network bearing a color which shows the pattern
   type to which it has been assigned.}},

Abstract = {{Based on Kohsiek's fast air circulation chamber, a method has been
   developed to measure the surface resistance to vapor diffusion in a
   drying topsoil. This resistance is important to estimate evaporation
   from bare soils using an aerodynamic resistance formulation.
   Measurements were done for a fine sandy loam during a dry down after
   artificial wetting. Surface resistance started to increase at a moisture
   content of 15\% by volume in the l-cm top layer, which is 50\% of its
   moisture content at field capacity. Calculations of the aerodynamic
   resistance were corrected for stability and were used to isolate the
   real surface resistance from the bulk resistance. Resistances could be
   modeled as a function of the top 1 cm soil moisture and varied between
   approximately 10 s/m for a wet and several thousand seconds per meter
   for a dry top layer. The measurements demonstrated a very pronounced
   diurnal course due to drying of the very top layer during the day and
   recovery of the moisture profile during nighttime hours.}},

Abstract = {{The S-11 scatter function of a coaxial probe in the frequency domain is
   shown to be an accurate model for predicting waveforms of a seven-wire
   coaxial probe in the time domain. Reproducibility of discrete Fourier
   analyses carried out on waveforms measured with the Tektronix 1502b
   cable tester (Tektronix, Incorporated, Beaverton, Oregon) indicated a
   frequency band width ranging from 20 kHz to approximately 1.5 GHz. The
   frequency dependent complex dielectric permittivity can be calculated
   from measured waveforms by inverting the S-11 scatter function. Results
   indicate that a seven-wire coaxial probe, connected to a 1-m RG214
   coaxial cable, emulates a coaxial tube for frequencies up to 150 MHz.
   Application of the frequency domain model to time domain reflectometry
   waveforms shows that the apparent dielectric permittivity calculated
   from the travel time in the probe is very dependent on the relaxation
   frequency of the material in which the probe is embedded. For materials
   with low relaxation frequencies the apparent dielectric permittivity is
   much lower than the static permittivity. Inversion of the frequency
   domain model allows for solving the frequency dependent complex
   dielectric permittivity of soils from measured waveforms.}},

Abstract = {{Although time domain reflectometry (TDR) is becoming accepted as an
   important tool for the measurement of soil water content and bulk soil
   electrical conductivity, a major part of the method is based on
   empirical relationships. An improved understanding of dielectric
   measurements on soils mat give more insight into soil properties other
   than soil water content and bulk soil electrical conductivity. Frequency
   domain analysis of TDR waveforms enables the measurement of the
   frequency dependent complex dielectric permittivity of soils. The
   frequency dependent complex dielectric permittivity of soils can be
   described with a four-component complex dielectric mixing model based on
   the volumetric mixing of the refractive indices of the soil components.
   The four soil components in the model are air, solids, bound water, and
   free water. Results indicate that the apparent dielectric permittivity
   obtained from the travel time of the TDR pulse in the soil is the
   dielectric permittivity at the highest measurement frequency of the
   cable tester, probe, arid soil system. The model based on the volumetric
   mixing of real permittivities underestimates the measurements in
   situations with high values of the imaginary part of the dielectric
   permittivity. Because the model based on the mixing of the complex
   dielectric permittivities can describe the data, we conclude that the
   apparent dielectric permittivity is influenced by the imaginary parts in
   the dielectric permittivities of the soil components. Combination of the
   four-component complex dielectric mixing model with the complex
   dielectric permittivity obtained from the frequency domain analysis of
   TDR waveforms gives a tool for modeling the bulk soil electrical
   conductivity by separating the conductivity of the soil water into a
   bound water conductivity and a free water conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic conductivity function, which is required to solve the
   Richards equation, is difficult to measure. Therefore prediction methods
   are frequently used where the shape of the conductivity function is
   estimated from the more easily measured water retention characteristic.
   Errors in conductivity estimations can arise either from an invalidity
   of the prediction model for a given soil, or from an incorrect
   description of the retention data. This second error source is
   particularly important for soils with heterogeneous pore systems that
   cannot be adequately described by the usually used retention functions.
   To describe the retention characteristics of such soils, a flexible
   theta(psi) function was formed by superimposing unimodal retention
   curves of the van Genuchten (1980) type. By combining this retention
   model with the conductivity prediction model of Mualem (1976),
   conductivity estimations for soils with heterogeneous pore systems are
   obtained. Estimated conductivities by this model and the classical van
   Genuchten-Mualem method can differ by orders of magnitude. Thus reported
   disagreements between measured and estimated conductivities may in some
   cases be due to an inadequate description of the retention data rather
   than due to a failure of the prediction model.}},

Abstract = {{A 10-mM LiCl solution was hydraulically forced through a 0.3-cm-thick
   smectite membrane at a constant solution flux in order to depict the
   chemical and isotopic evolution of analogous hyperfiltration cells in
   the subsurface. At steady state (similar to 19 days) there was, relative
   to the input solution, a measured 12\% buildup of solute within the
   entire cell and a calculated 248\% solute increase at the clay/solution
   interface. The maximum depletion of Li-7 (about 13 parts per thousand
   relative to the input solution) was calculated to occur about 1 cm away
   from the membrane out into the high-pressure reservoir. When scaled to
   realistic solution fluxes in natural systems, the position of maximum
   fractionation would occur meters away from a shale/aquifer contact. A
   steady state hyperfiltration model indicates that a solute's heavy
   isotopic species will always be depleted on the high-pressure side of a
   clay membrane, a prediction corroborated not only by the Li experiment
   but also by previous hyperfiltration studies involving stable isotopes
   of C and Cl. The extent of fractionation increases with higher values of
   the membrane's reflection coefficient, sigma. In the experiment a sigma
   of 0.55 for the 90\% porosity clay membrane yielded these results.
   Because shales have substantially lower porosities with attendant higher
   values of sigma, we conclude that the hyperfiltration phenomenon in the
   subsurface may result in sampling of waters that are not chemically and
   isotopically representative of the formation penetrated by the well.}},

Abstract = {{Soil nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) data arranged on a three-dimensional grid
   were analyzed to compare tillage effect on the spatial distribution of
   residual NO3-N in the soil profile of agricultural plots drained by
   subsurface tiles. A three-dimensional median-based resistant (to
   outlier(s)) approach was developed to polish the spatially located data
   on soil NO3-N affected by directional trends (nonstationarity in the
   mean) in three major directions (row, column, and depth) and along the
   horizontal diagonal directions of the grid. Effect of preferential or
   nonpreferential path of transport of NO3-N in the vertical direction
   defined as sample hole effect was also removed to make the data
   trend-free across holes. Composite three-dimensional semivariogram
   models (along horizontal and vertical directions) were used to describe
   the spatial structure of residual soil nitrate distribution. Two plots
   in the same field, one under each tillage system (conventional tillage
   and no tillage), were studied. In each plot, soil samples were collected
   at five depths (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 cm) from 35 sites (holes)
   arranged on a 7 x 5 regular grid of 7.6 x 7.6 m. In the conventional
   tillage plot, residual NO3-N concentrations decreased gradually to a
   depth of 90 cm and increased beyond this depth. The coefficient of
   variation, however, became gradually smaller, showing more uniform
   distribution for greater depths. In the no-tillage plot, trends were
   similar to those in the conventional tillage system, but were spatially
   more stable across the profile. Structural analyses indicated that under
   conventional tillage, the semivariogram of residual soil nitrate
   distribution was linear in the horizontal and vertical directions. In
   contrast, the semivariograms for no-tillage showed nugget-type behavior,
   indicating a lack of spatial structure in the residual soil nitrate.}},

Abstract = {{Four month-long field experiments investigated movements of water and
   solutes through unsaturated sand plains near Princeton, Minnesota, and
   Oakes, North Dakota. Atrazine and bromide were applied to bare soils and
   soils planted with corn. The field plots were irrigated according to
   local farming practices. At the end of each experiment, unsaturated
   soils were analyzed for atrazine and bromide concentrations and oxygen
   and hydrogen isotope compositions of soil water. Most soil water was
   affected by evaporation but groundwater beneath the plots had no
   evaporative isotopic signature. Therefore most recharge consisted of
   water that was unaffected by evaporation. Sources of such water may have
   included snowmelt, prolonged or high-intensity rainfalls that were not
   interrupted by periods of drying, and water that moved through
   preferential flow paths. Preferential flow also was suggested by the
   detection of atrazine, deethylatrazine, and bromide in groundwater
   shortly after each application of irrigation water at Princeton and by
   isolated concentrations of atrazine and bromide in soil well below the
   main masses of chemicals at Oakes.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual stochastic model is developed that describes the natural
   spatial variability of nonreactive solute concentrations in large
   groundwater systems. The spatial variation in aqueous concentration is
   associated with dissolution from source areas of high mineral enrichment
   in the aquifer matrix. The stochastic model considers randomly varying
   inputs of a solute species from source deposits that occur as a
   two-dimensional spatial Poisson process. A steady state
   advective-dispersive transport equation is utilized to predict the
   downgradient movement of the solute from the source areas. The total
   groundwater concentration at any location is calculated from the
   superposition of the individual contributions from each source area in
   the aquifer. A spatially varying concentration field results, described
   mathematically by a filtered Poisson process model. The theoretical
   concentration field is nonstationary, with the mean and variance
   increasing, and the coefficient of variation decreasing, in the
   direction of groundwater flow. Gaussian fields for abundant elements and
   highly skewed probability distributions for trace elements are indicated
   by the filtered Poisson process model. Evaluation of elemental
   concentration data from the Sherwood aquifer in England demonstrates how
   field data may be analyzed in the context of the stochastic model.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic controls on sulfate mobility were investigated in a forested
   catchment in the Georgia Piedmont using a watershed mass balance
   approach. Variations in annual sulfate export were governed primarily by
   differences in runoff rather than by differences in sulfate deposition
   or in total annual precipitation. However, 2 years with similar total
   runoff had substantially different sulfate export. A residual analysis
   indicated that a shift in the concentration-discharge relationship
   accounted for 72\% of the difference in sulfate export and that a change
   in the pattern of discharge accounted for the remainder of the
   difference. Stream water sulfate concentrations reflected past
   hydrologic conditions. Concentrations at the same discharge were higher
   following an extended dry period than following average periods. The
   elevation in stream water sulfate concentrations following dry periods
   persisted for several months. The influence of rainfall patterns on
   sulfate export underscores the need for long-term records to adequately
   characterize the acidification status of the watershed and to understand
   trends in water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Data from the large and diverse Adirondack-Lake Survey were used to
   calibrate four simple organic acid analog models in an effort to
   quantify the influence of naturally occurring organic acids on lake
   water pH and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC). The organic acid analog
   models were calibrated to observations of pH, dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC), and organic anion (A(n-)) concentrations from a reduced data set
   representing 1128 individual lake samples, expressed as 41 observations
   of mean pH, in intervals of 0.1 pH units from pH 3.9 to 7.0. Of the four
   organic analog approaches examined, including the Oliver et al. (1983)
   model, as well as monoprotic, diprotic, and triprotic representations,
   the triprotic analog model yielded the best fit (r(2) = 0.92) to the
   observed data. Moreover, the triprotic model was qualitatively
   consistent with observed patterns of change in organic solute charge
   density as a function of pH. A low calibrated value for the first H+
   dissociation constant (pK(a1) = 2.62) and the observation that organic
   anion concentrations were significant even at very low pH (<4) indicate
   that naturally occurring organic solutes in these waters have strongly
   acidic functional groups. Inclusion of organic acidity in model
   calculations resulted in good agreement between measured and predicted
   values of lake water pH and ANC. Assessments to project the response of
   surface waters to future changes in atmospheric deposition, through the
   use of acidification models, will need to include representations of
   organic acids in model structure to make accurate predictions of pH and
   ANC.}},

Abstract = {{The attenuation of gamma radiation was utilized to measure changing
   residual trichloroethylene (TCE) saturation in an otherwise
   water-saturated porous medium as clean water was flushed through the
   medium. A front over which dissolution actively occurred was observed.
   Once developed, this front varied in length from approximate to 11 mm to
   approximate to 21 mm, lengthening as it moved through the porous medium.
   Gamma attenuation measurements and analyses of effluent water samples
   indicate that there was minimal if any transport of TCE as colloidal
   droplets. Even as trapped TCE ganglia decreased in size due to
   dissolution, there is no evidence that they became mobile and advected
   downgradient. An extraction of the porous medium at the completion of
   one experiment indicated that less than 0.002\% of the original TCE mass
   remained, suggesting that minimal amounts of separate phase TCE remained
   trapped within the medium after flushing with 290 pore volumes. Mass
   transfer rate coefficients were computed and are shown to be a function
   of Darcy flux, TCE volumetric content, and distance into the region of
   residual TCE.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the experimental measurement and mathematical
   modeling of processes affecting the dissolution of nonaqueous phase
   liquids (NAPLs) entrapped in sandy porous media. Results of a series of
   laboratory-scale one-dimensional column dissolution experiments indicate
   that the length of time required to dissolve NAPLs and substantially
   reduce aqueous phase effluent concentrations is many times greater than
   predicted by equilibrium calculations. Experimental measurements clearly
   show an influence of both grain size and grain size distribution on the
   evolution of effluent concentrations. The longer cleaning times
   associated with coarse or graded media are attributed to the larger and
   more amorphous NAPL blobs associated with these media. A general
   correlation for transient dissolution rates is proposed which
   incorporates porous medium properties, Reynolds number, and volumetric
   fraction of NAPL. The model is calibrated with results from styrene
   dissolution experiments and is shown to adequately predict
   trichloroethylene dissolution rates in the same sandy media over the
   period of time required to dissolve the NAPL.}},

Abstract = {{Many solutes, either naturally occurring or introduced, are surface
   active and sorb preferentially at the interfaces of subsurface systems.
   In multiphase systems, the sorption of surfactants affects the capillary
   pressure-saturation relationships, fundamental constitutive
   relationships in the modeling of multiphase flow. In this study, the
   impact of surfactant sorption on capillary pressure relationships for
   organic liquid-waters systems was demonstrated by qualitatively
   correlating measurements of sorption and zeta potential, with
   interfacial tension and contact angle and, in turn, quantitatively
   relating these measurements to changes in capillary pressure-saturation
   relationships for o-xylene-water-quartz systems containing a cationic
   surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The results show that
   the sorption of CTAB causes the naturally hydrophilic system to become
   hydrophobic, as evidenced by a change in the contact angle from about 10
   degrees-15 degrees to 155 degrees or 180 degrees, depending on the pH.
   This change in hydrophilicity is reflected in the zeta potential of the
   system which goes from negative to positive as the aqueous phase CTAB
   concentration increases. The spontaneous imbibition capillary
   pressure-saturation relationship is more sensitive to the sorption of
   CTAB than the drainage relationship. To predict the observed changes in
   both capillary pressure-saturation relationships, a modified form of
   Leverett's function was used where roughness and curvature corrections
   were incorporated into the intrinsic contact angle to give an
   operational contact angle. A comparison of the measured and predicted
   capillary pressure-saturation relationships showed reasonable agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated flow and solute transport models in isothermal porous media
   generally assume surface tension at the air-water interface to be
   constant. Yet many organic compounds, including a number of
   environmental interest, reduce surface tension in proportion to their
   aqueous phase concentrations; An isothermal saturated-unsaturated flow
   and transport model has been developed that incorporates variable
   surface tension caused by varying solute concentration. The model was
   based on the pressure head form of the unsaturated flow equation and was
   solved using finite element methods. The extreme nonlinearities inherent
   in the problem necessitated spatial discretization on the scale of
   millimeters and initial temporal discretization on the scale of
   milliseconds. A comparison of simulations with and without varying
   surface tension showed that changes in surface tension could have
   significant effects on pressure head, water content, water flux, and
   solute flux. Implications relative to multiphase flow models,
   unsaturated zone contamination, and remedial technologies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Vapor extraction is a commonly used method for removing nonaqueous phase
   liquid volatile organic compounds (VOC) from the vadose zone. Experience
   indicates that in the absence of liquid VOC, the efficiency of vapor
   extraction systems decreases dramatically with time as effluent
   concentrations approach zero asymptotically. When such systems are
   restarted after a temporary shutdown, effluent concentrations are often
   found to recover for a short period before dropping back to preshutdown
   levels. This behavior is generally attributed to kinetic processes which
   limit the transfer of contaminant into the moving air. A numerical model
   is developed to simulate the rate-limited extraction of volatile
   compounds governed by first-order kinetic mass transfer processes. A
   sensitivity analysis is performed to identify model responses to various
   kinetic and equilibrium partitioning processes. The model is calibrated
   using experimental data collected from a pilot-scale experiment
   involving vapor extraction of trichloroethylene from fine sand. An
   analysis of the relationships between airflow rates and the kinetic mass
   transfer coefficients under various pumping schemes shows that for a
   given condition, increasing the flow rate has little effect beyond a
   certain point. It is also shown that pulsed pumping is generally less
   efficient than continuous pumping at a low rate.}},

Abstract = {{A forced-gradient test of solute transport was conducted adjacent to the
   site of a previous natural gradient test to allow comparison of results
   obtained from the two types of field tests. In the forced-gradient test,
   one inorganic tracer and four organic solutes (carbon tetrachloride,
   trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and hexachloroethane) were
   injected for 48 hours. The migration of the dissolved chemicals toward
   the extraction well was monitored by multilevel samplers and a partially
   penetrating monitoring well. Moment analyses of the solute breakthrough
   curves at the multilevel points provide model-independent insight into
   the variation of hydraulic conductivity and organic solute retardation
   in the aquifer. The estimated retardation factors fall within the range
   estimated in the previous natural gradient test. Sorption distribution
   coefficients inferred from the transport data indicate spatial
   variability of sorption for all solutes, with mean values and ranges
   similar to those observed in laboratory studies of core dr bulk samples.
   Some evidence was obtained for spatially variable in situ transformation
   of hexachloroethane.}},

Abstract = {{Conservative tracer transport was monitored at 42 multilevel points and
   a partially penetrating (PP) well during a forced-gradient test in the
   Borden aquifer. Point breakthrough curves were adequately simulated by
   the advection-dispersion model indicating negligible or nondetectable
   physical nonequilibrium effects. Relative hydraulic conductivities
   estimated from fitted how rated for. each point varied by almost an
   order of magnitude, similar to the variation previously reported for
   permeameter analyses of samples from a nearby core transect.
   Longitudinal dispersivities were 16 cm for the PP well data and ranged
   from approximately 1 to 11 cm for the point data. These values are
   within the range of local dispersivities reported for point data in
   previous tracer tests at the Borden site and other experiments.
   Composite later simulations of the PP well utilizing flow and
   dispersivity estimates from multilevel data matched the general shape of
   the observed response but not its position.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of four organic solutes was monitored in 15 multilevel points
   and a partially penetrating well during a forced-gradient test in the
   Borden aquifer. Simulations assuming equilibrium sorption were unable to
   match the observed breakthrough curves, particularly for the more highly
   sorbing solutes. The data were better fit by first-order physical
   nonequilibrium simulations including mass transfer between mobile and
   immobile water regions. Assuming 86\% of total porosity is mobile, as
   estimated previously, curve fits yielded estimates of K-d (sorption
   distribution coefficient), f (fraction of sorption sites within mobile
   water regions), and alpha (first-order mass transfer coefficient). K-d
   and f estimates compare well with those from previous laboratory studies
   and simulations of the natural gradient test previously conducted
   nearby. The estimated alpha values compare reasonably well with those
   derived from laboratory tests but are considerably higher than the value
   utilized in simulations of the natural gradient test.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of the concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs),
   tritium, and other environmental tracers can be used to calculate
   recharge ages of shallow groundwater and estimate rates of groundwater
   movement. Numerical simulation also provides quantitative estimates of
   flow rates, flow paths, and mixing properties of the groundwater system.
   The environmental tracer techniques and the hydraulic analyses each
   contribute to the understanding and quantification of the flow of
   shallow groundwater. However, when combined, the two methods provide
   feedback that improves the quantification of the flow system and
   provides insight into the processes that are the most uncertain. A case
   study near Locust Grove, Maryland, is used to investigate the utility of
   combining groundwater age dating, based on CFCs and tritium, and
   hydraulic analyses using numerical simulation techniques. The results of
   the feedback between an advective transport model and the estimates of
   groundwater ages determined by the CFCs improve a quantitative
   description of the system by refining the system conceptualization and
   estimating system parameters. The plausible system developed with this
   feedback between the advective flow model and the CFC ages is further
   tested using a solute transport simulation to reproduce the observed
   tritium distribution in the groundwater. The solute transport simulation
   corroborates the plausible system developed and also indicates that, for
   the system under investigation with the data obtained from 0.9-m-long
   (3-foot-long) well screens, the hydrodynamic dispersion is negligible.
   Together the two methods enable a coherent explanation of the flow paths
   and rates of movement while indicating weaknesses in the understanding
   of the system that will require future data collection and conceptual
   refinement of the groundwater system.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal extraction well locations and pumping rates are compared, based
   on a limited number of deterministic simulations, for multiple
   contaminant plumes exhibiting rate-limited, or nonequilibrium, mass
   transfer from a mobile to an immobile phase. This rate-limited mass
   transfer results in what we define as rate-limited, or nonequilibrium,
   transport. Two-dimensional, nonequilibrium solute transport simulation
   and optimization are used to study the simultaneous remediation of
   carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane and tetrahydrofuran that have
   been chromatographically separated during transport by groundwater.
   Minimum total pumping necessary for cleanup is compared for five
   different well geometries over remediation periods of 3 and 15 years.
   The sensitivity of these designs to first-order mass transfer rates is
   examined for equilibrium and for three levels of nonequilibrium
   transport. The key results of this particular study are that (1) classic
   contaminant capture at downgradient wells is a poor design for
   contaminant cleanup; (2) for effective design of multiple plume
   remediation, the transport characteristics of each contaminant must be
   considered; (3) if solute transport is limited by mass transfer from an
   immobile to a mobile phase, there is a minimum remediation time which
   cannot be reduced by adjustment of pumping rates or changing well
   locations; (4) the optimal locations and pumping rates of extraction
   wells are less sensitive to nonequilibrium transport for long-term
   remediation than for short-term remediation; and (5) competition between
   pumping wells may significantly affect the feasibility and efficiency of
   specific multiple-well cleanup designs. In addition, a method and a
   measurement are presented for evaluating the importance to remediation
   of rate-limited mass transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Atrazine retention on a Sharkey clay soil was quantified using a kinetic
   batch method for different soil to solution ratios. Time-dependent
   adsorption-desorption was also measured using a batch method with
   successive dilution steps. Adsorption was found to be highly kinetic in
   nature. In addition, adsorption-desorption isotherms exhibited a strong
   hysteretic behavior. The extent of observed hysteresis increased with
   retention time. Attempts were made to describe atrazine retention based
   on a modified second-order approach where heterogeneity of adsorption
   sites was assumed. Two retention sites were considered: type 1 (S-e)
   represented that retained on noncatalytic sites with low binding energy,
   and type 2 (S-k) was that retained on catalytic sites and form strong
   interactions with matrix surfaces. A third type (S-i) represented
   irreversible sites occupied by hydroxyatrazine following hydrolysis or
   other physical/chemical transformations. The rates of reactions were
   assumed as a function of vacant or available sites which were equally
   accessible to either S-e or S-k. A direct method to quantify the
   adsorption capacity (phi(m)) as a measure of the total retention sites
   by maintaining high atrazine concentrations in soil solution was not
   successful. However, the use of an indirectly estimated phi(m) along
   with nonlinear least squares adequately described kinetic retention
   results. Based on least square best fit, model parameters were
   independent of initial concentrations (C-i) and an overall set of
   parameters was capable of describing an entire data set for all C-i. The
   model was also successful in predicting atrazine retention for a
   different data set and for all C-i using one set of model parameters
   which were obtained independently from another data set. Further
   application of the model was to test whether these independently
   estimated model parameters can predict the kinetics of
   adsorption-desorption hysteresis. Unlike other approaches where
   adsorption and desorption isotherms were separately described, the
   second-order model was capable of describing both adsorption and
   desorption kinetics. Improved hysteresis predictions were observed when
   model parameters were derived from experiments of similar conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to nonlinear groundwater management methodology is
   presented which optimizes aquifer remediation with the aid of artificial
   neural networks (ANNs). The methodology allows solute transport
   simulations, usually the main computational component of management
   models, to be run in parallel. The ANN technology, inspired by
   neurobiological theories of massive interconnection and parallelism, has
   been successfully applied to a variety of optimization problems. In this
   new approach, optimal management solutions are found by (1) first
   training an ANN to predict the outcome of the flow and transport code,
   and (2) then using the trained ANN to search through many pumping
   realizations to find an optimal one for successful remediation. The
   behavior of complex groundwater scenarios with spatially variable
   transport parameters and multiple contaminant plumes is simulated with a
   two-dimensional hybrid finite-difference/finite-element flow and
   transport code. The flow and transport code develops the set of examples
   upon which the network is trained. The input of the ANN characterizes
   the different realizations of pumping, with each input indicating the
   pumping level of a well. The output is capable of characterizing the
   objectives and constraints of the optimization, such as attainment of
   regulatory goals, value of cost functions and cleanup time, and mass of
   contaminant removal. The supervised learning algorithm of back
   propagation was used to train the network. The conjugate gradient method
   and weight elimination procedures are used to speed convergence and
   improve performance, respectively. Once trained, the ANN begins a search
   through various realizations of pumping patterns to determine whether or
   not they will be successful. The search is directed by a simple genetic
   algorithm. The resulting management solutions are consistent with those
   resulting from a more conventional optimization technique, which
   combines solute transport modeling and nonlinear programming with a
   quasi-Newton search. The results suggest that the ANN approach has the
   following advantages over the conventional technique for the test
   remediations: more independence of the flow and transport code from the
   optimization, greater influence of hydrogeologic insight, and less
   computational burden due to the potential for parallel processing of the
   flow and transport simulations and the ability to `'recycle'' these
   simulations. The ANN performance was observed upon variation of the
   problem formulation, network architecture, and learning algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{A method for pattern completion based on the application of artificial
   neural networks and possessing many operational objectives of the
   ordinary kriging approach, neural kriging, is developed. A neural
   kriging (NK) network is described, implemented in a parallelizing
   algorithm, and applied to develop maps of discrete spatially distributed
   fields (e.g., log hydraulic conductivity). NK is, in the case df two
   discrete field values, similar to indicator kriging. It uses a
   feed-forward counterpropagation training approach because field
   observations are available and because fast yet reliable results are
   obtained. NK is data-driven and requires no estimate of a covariance
   function. The optimal design of the NK network is found to depend on the
   number of hidden units in a more complex way than expected. The quality
   of the estimate of each pixel of the NK maps can be presented as well,
   as in kriging, to help identify areas in which additional information
   will be most beneficial. A comparison with a reference field shows that
   the NK network produces unbiased errors relative to sample bias and
   reproduces the variogram of a quantized random field with reasonable
   accuracy. Ordinary kriging (OK) followed by quantization can also
   perform well; however, estimation errors in the variogram selected for
   use in OK (in this case the range coefficient in particular) must be
   carefully examined and treated. The NK method can provide multiple
   realizations of the estimated field, all of which respect observations;
   hence conditional simulation is demonstrably possible. The combination
   of simplicity, interpolation, reasonably accurate prediction statistics,
   ability to provide conditional simulations, and computational speed
   suggest that artificial neural networks can be useful tools in
   geohydrology when applied to specific well-defined problems for which
   they are well suited, such as aquifer characterization.}},

Abstract = {{A relatively simple method of characteristics is developed to simulate
   one-dimensional variably saturated water flow. The method uses the
   Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to separate the governing flow equation
   into `'convection'' and `'diffusion'' parts, which are solved with the
   method of characteristics and the conventional finite element method,
   respectively. The method of characteristics combines a single-step
   reverse particle tracking technique with a correction strategy to ensure
   accurate mass balances. The correction process is implemented by
   weighing the calculated convective contribution to the pressure head at
   each node with the pressure head values of two upstream nodes, using an
   adaptive weighing factor lambda. The value of lambda is automatically
   adjusted by considering the global mass balance at each time step.
   Numerical experiments for ponded infiltration are presented to
   illustrate the scheme's performance for situations involving highly
   nonlinear soil hydraulic properties and extremely dry initial
   conditions. Results indicate that the proposed method is
   mass-conservative, virtually oscillation-free, and computationally quite
   efficient. The method is especially effective for simulating highly
   nonlinear flow scenarios for which traditional finite difference and
   finite element numerical methods often fail to converge.}},

Abstract = {{Practical aspects of three-dimensional modeling of groundwater flow in
   heterogeneous aquifer systems are investigated using a finite element
   approach. Particular attention is given to the properties of the
   conductance matrix and the efficiency of the conjugate gradient method
   with different preconditioners: diagonal scaling, incomplete Cholesky
   decomposition, incomplete factorization, and modified incomplete
   factorization. It is shown that for hexahedral trilinear finite elements
   the resulting matrix is, except for cube-shaped elements, never
   diagonally dominant, which restricts the existence of several
   preconditioners. Numerical comparison of several test problems,
   including hypothetical and field applications with different degrees of
   heterogeneity, show that the incomplete Cholesky and the incomplete
   factorization preconditioners, if they exist, are more efficient than
   diagonal scaling with respect to both rate of convergence and overall
   computing time, but diagonal scaling can be considered superior because
   it is always possible. An M matrix transformation is proposed which
   guarantees the existence of all preconditioners. Numerical comparison of
   the test problems shows that this technique is very effective. From the
   resulting preconditioners, the incomplete Cholesky and the incomplete
   factorization are shown to be the most efficient, but the latter is
   superior from the point of view of computer storage and is recommended
   for all practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated flows within subsurface regions control many large-scale
   hydrological and environmental processes. This study addresses the issue
   of spatial averaging of unsaturated flow equations at field scales. Two
   models for horizontally averaged unsaturated flow have been developed
   from two different approaches in this study. The spatially horizontally
   averaged Richards equation (SHARE) model is represented by a system of
   two coupled partial differential equations for the mean water saturation
   in each horizontal soil layer and the cross-covariance of the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity and the water saturation in each horizontal soil
   layer in a heterogeneous field. As an alternative to the spatial
   averaging/perturbation approach which was used for SHARE, a spatially
   horizontally averaged form of Green-Ampt model is obtained by field
   scale spatial horizontal averaging of the local soil water dynamics
   which are represented approximately by rectangular profiles. This
   strategy leads to analytical solutions for average water content and the
   results can be upscaled to large spatial areas. The computational effort
   required to evaluate such analytic expressions is trivial in comparison
   with that of the numerical solution of Richards equation. The averaged
   Green-Ampt model, though approximate, yields good results when large
   variations exist in the soil properties in the horizontal directions.}},

Abstract = {{Two models for horizontally averaged unsaturated flow have been
   developed from two different approaches in the first (Chen et al., this
   issue) of these companion papers. In this paper the results from both
   the spatially horizontally averaged Richards equation (SHARE) model and
   the averaged Green-Ampt model are compared with the results from a
   three-dimensional finite difference model of unsaturated flow which is
   perceived as the reference solution. The results of the averaged
   Green-Ampt model show very good agreement with the averaged results from
   the three-dimensional model, while SHARE model results are applicable
   only when fluctuations in soil parameters are small with respect to
   their mean values. It is also shown that methods of simple parameter
   averaging (arithmetic or geometric averages) with the local Richards
   equation does not yield meaningful results in heterogeneous soils. This
   study suggests that spatially horizontally averaged simplified models
   (such as the averaged Green-Ampt model) are attractive alternatives to
   perturbation models (such as the SHARE model) in heterogeneous fields.
   Due to their simplicity in formulation, accuracy in predicting average
   behaviors, and minimal requirement of computer effort, the spatially
   horizontally averaged simplified models can be easily implemented in
   large-scale models, such as atmospheric mesoscale models.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{The problem of one-dimensional groundwater flow in a homogeneous leaky
   aquifer is analyzed within a stochastic framework. The stochastic
   analysis is straightforward and exact; it is based on a closed-form
   solution obtained using the Laplace transform method. The solution
   relates linearly a stochastic perturbation of the aquifer head to
   uncertainty in the initial aquifer head and stochastic fluctuations of
   the water table in an overlying phreatic aquifer. Autocorrelation
   functions for the aquifer head, the leakage flow, and the base flow are
   developed for two cases of the water table fluctuations, namely,
   delta-correlation fluctuations (i.e., white noise) and fully correlated
   fluctuations. The analysis clearly demonstrates that the stochasticity
   of the aquifer hydraulic response is highly controlled by the
   geohydrology of the problem: the geometry given by aquifer length and
   the hydraulic properties given by the leakage factor, aquifer
   diffusivity, and aquitard leakance. The results show that the temporal
   variance of aquifer head induced by a random initial head persists
   longer for larger values of the dimensionless leakage factor. The
   smaller the dimensionless leakage factor, the greater the variance of
   aquifer head, leakage, and base flow. Asymptotic results obtained for
   large times reveal that (1) watertable fluctuations that are white noise
   induce a cumulative leakage whose variance is asymptotically linear in
   time, and quadratic in time if the fluctuations are fully correlated:
   (2) the variance of the aquitard leakage flux is asymptotically equal to
   the variance of its time average if the fluctuations of the water table
   are fully correlated in time; (3) cumulative base flow and cumulative
   leakage have identical autocorrelation function when water table
   fluctuations are fully correlated in time; and (4) the attenuating
   characteristic of aquifer flow systems, often observed in the spectral
   domain, is evident in the case of highly variable water table
   fluctuations (white noise); the base flow has a finite variance when the
   leakage flux has an infinite variance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates two-dimensional aquifer flow under naturally
   variable recharge and its application to optimal estimation in
   groundwater. The adopted framework is a stochastic one in which the
   governing stochastic equation is solved quasi-analytically using the
   Galerkin finite element method and matrix exponentials. The
   continuous-time stochastic solution relates head perturbations to random
   initial head and a convolution of the pertinent stochastic recharge
   process. Based on the quasi-analytical solution, continuous time
   autocorrelation matrices for aquifer head are developed conforming to
   (1) white noise recharge fluctuations in time and (2) fully correlated
   recharge fluctuations in time. From a stochastic point of view,
   transient aquifer flow in its conventional meaning is only inferred when
   recharge fluctuations ai e fully correlated in time, provided that the
   mean flow approaches steady state. Application to optimal state feedback
   estimation is demonstrated by adopting Kalman filtering and forecasting
   to a numerical experiment consisting of two-dimensional aquifer flow
   instigated by variable leakage. Filtering results demonstrate that under
   scarce measurements, statistical conditioning on available measurements
   Can result in an estimated aquifer hydraulic response that captures the
   actual variability that may exist under natural field conditions.
   Forecasted aquifer heads, however, are sufficient for a relatively short
   period; they converge asymptotically to their respective average values.}},

Abstract = {{A model is proposed for the sorption of organic solutes from aqueous

   matter. A general expression of the solute uptake in the Laplace domain
   is obtained, which together with appropriate macroscopic conservation
   equations and standard Laplace transform inversion techniques, may be
   used to obtain the extent of sorption and the distribution of organics

Abstract = {{Modeling of the time evolution of a solute plume in a heterogeneous
   porous formation has often focused on low-order spatial concentration
   moments calculated in comprehensive field experiments in which a plume
   is sampled synoptically at successive stages of its postinjection
   development. Assumptions of a, stochastic nature usually have been
   invoked to derive equations that predict the time dependence of these
   spatial moments and permit their interpretation in terms of field
   concentration data. In this paper, expressions for the low-order spatial
   moments are derived on the basis of a purely dynamical formulation of
   plume motion in terms of the solution of the autonomous ordinary
   differential equation determined by a steady fluid velocity field. The
   equations derived stress the importance of spatial interdependence
   between the (arbitrary) initial state of a solute plume, as defined by
   its concentration field, and the subsequent displacements of moving
   spatial points determined by a groundwater velocity field.}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed for predicting the location of major vegetation
   ecotones in eastern North America. The model is based upon the
   interaction of plant physiological characteristics, climate, and soil in
   order to be useful as an interactive boundary condition in atmospheric
   general circulation models. The model represents the relative
   competitive ability of different vegetation types by their annual net
   primary productivity as expressed through water use. At any given
   location, the vegetation type with the highest productivity is assumed
   to be dominant. Ecotones are located where competitive dominance shifts
   from one vegetation type to another. Productivity is computed as a
   function of annual evapotranspiration, which is a function of the length
   of the growing season, photosynthetic capacity, potential
   evapotranspiration, and soil moisture availability, among other things.
   When considering the coniferous boreal/deciduous forest ecotone, it is
   found that inherent physiological differences between conifers and
   deciduous trees lead to differences in productivity which are related
   primarily to temperature. The model predicts a reversal of
   deciduous/coniferous productive dominance at the latitude of the
   observed ecotone; that is, within the transition zone of mixed forest.
   The productivity model does not adequately explain the existence of the
   deciduous/southern pine ecotone. Soil chemistry apparently plays a role
   in the determination of this boundary.}},

Abstract = {{This paper exposes the significant role played by the gas-water
   interface in the fate and transport of colloids in porous media and also
   introduces a micromodel method to allow direct visualization of colloid
   behavior in pore networks. The gas-water interface was created by
   trapping air in the pore space. Various types of latex and clay
   particles, as well as bacteria, were studied. The results suggest that
   the gas-water interface sorbs not only hydrophobic but also hydrophilic
   particles. The degree of sorption is controlled by particle surface
   hydrophobicity, solution ionic strength, and particle charge sign.
   Sorption increases with increasing particle hydrophobicity and solution
   ionic strength, while positively charged particles have a very strong
   affinity for the gas-water interface. The sorption on the gas-water
   interface is essentially irreversible, in that the capillary free energy
   provides a large attractive force to hold particles on the gas-water
   interface after its rupture. These findings reveal a mechanism of vadose
   zone transport: A static gas-water interface behaves as a sorbent phase
   retarding the transport of particulate contaminants. The visualization
   method developed in this research is very useful for the investigation
   of particulate contaminant behavior and interface-related transport,
   especially in the context of bioremediation.}},

Abstract = {{For some potentially useful and emerging in situ bioremediation
   technologies it is important to control bacterial attachment to
   subsurface materials during the injection of microbial cell suspensions.
   In this study the attachment patterns of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b
   were measured after horizontal injections into a two-dimensional
   miniature aquifer simulator containing a wet homogeneous sand. In
   preliminary sand column assays, bacterial attachment to the sand was
   increased nearly 2 orders of magnitude compared to attachment in the
   presence of distilled water by raising the concentration of a pH 7.0
   sodium-potassium phosphate buffer to 10 mM. The maximal concentration of
   attached cells was similar to 4 x 10(8) cells/g dry sand with both sand
   minicolumns and the wet sand aquifer simulator. For the latter this
   occurred on streamlines directly between the horizontal injector and
   withdrawal ports, where injection-withdrawal velocities were the
   highest. The effects of a simulated groundwater cross flow during
   suspension injection on bacterial attachment to the aquifer simulator
   sands were also studied, and a peristaltic pumping method to counteract
   these groundwater flow effects resulted in a more localized pattern,
   i.e., without extensive downstream skewing of the bacterial attachment
   zone. Phenol red was utilized as a nonbinding, red-colored tracer
   compound. It proved to be very convenient for quantitatively measuring
   the earlier breakthroughs of cells versus an inert tracer during the
   aquifer simulator and subsequent capillary tube cell injection
   experiments and also fdr visualizing the anticipated boundaries of cell
   attachment in the aquifer simulator. The effect of injection velocity on
   the observed bacterial attachment patterns in these experiments appears
   to be accounted for by colloid filtration theory.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a tracer experiment conducted in a single fracture are
   interpreted using a semianalytical model which accounts for advective
   dispersion, matrix diffusion, mixing in the test zones, and for
   tortuosity. The experiment was conducted using a conservative tracer
   which was injected into a steady divergent flow field. Arrival of tracer
   was monitored in an array of 13 boreholes intersecting the fracture over
   a square area of approximately 30 m on a side. The arrival of tracer was
   detected in 11 of the 13 boreholes. Simulation of the transport process
   suggests that matrix diffusion may play a significant role in the
   migration of solutes. Contrary to previously published results, the
   relative influence of advective dispersion was found to be increasingly
   diminished with increasing scale. Fracture apertures determined from the
   results of the tracer experiment were found to be in general agreement
   with apertures calculated from independent hydraulic tests. The
   individual advective processes that contribute to advective dispersion
   remain unresolved on the basis of this experiment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the hydrochemical evolution of groundwaters in the
   multilayer artesian aquifer of the Continental Intercalaire (the mainly
   Jurassic Agadez-Dabla sandstones) aquifer of northern Niger. Isotopic
   and chemical changes in relation to the geological setting suggest that
   the increasing HCO3- alkalinity of the groundwaters is caused by
   interaction of deep CO2 with the aquifer matrix. Alteration of feldspars
   by CO2 with a delta(13)C value of -3.0 parts per thousand accounts for
   the observed alkalinity and isotopic and trends. Carbon 14 ages have
   been estimated for recent and Holocene groundwaters which have a
   distinct stable isotopic (H-2 and O-18) signature compared with C-14
   dead groundwaters from further west on the Irhazer Plain. Recharge
   temperatures, estimated by analysis of noble gas contents, show that the
   C-14 dead waters were recharged under conditions cooler than present
   averages in the region, possibly at the beginning of deglaciation
   (approximate to 16 ka B.P.) or during the period 23-30 ka B.P. Trends in
   the hydrochemistry of U are related to the deep CO2 alteration process.
   Radiogenic He contents increase along the flow direction and extremely
   high values occur in the proximity of U ores. Denitrification in the
   paleowaters of the Irhazer was assessed by measurements of
   nitrogen/argon ratios.}},

Abstract = {{Variability in hydraulic properties and various mechanisms resulting in
   rate-limited mass transfer influence field scale solute transport in
   aquifers. In this study analytical expressions are presented for the
   expected value and variance of the mass Aux for a solute undergoing a
   nonequilibrium sorption reaction controlled by first-order kinetics. The
   uncertainty in the mass flux, expressed through the variance, stems from
   finite solute injection volumes compared to the hydraulic conductivity
   integral scale. Two-dimensional numerical simulations are performed
   under statistically identical conditions to the ones assumed in the
   derivation of the analytical results. Two cases of variability in the
   log hydraulic conductivity are considered (sigma(Y)(2) = 0.1 and
   sigma(Y)(2) = 1.0). The analytical model and the numerical simulations
   yield comparable predictions of the mass flux statistics for both
   variability cases. Comparing conservative and kinetically sorbing solute
   an apparent effect of sorption kinetics is to lower the discrepancy
   between the analytical model and the simulations due to increased
   spreading of the solute resulting from rate-limiting mass transfer.}},

Abstract = {{Finding the history of a groundwater contaminant plume from measurements
   of its current spatial distribution is an ill-posed problem and,
   consequently, its solution is extremely sensitive to errors in the input
   data. In this paper, Tikhonov regularization (Tikhonov and Arsenin,
   1977) is used in numerical experiments to recover the release history of
   a plume that has originated from a known, single site. The recovered
   release history is then used to reconstruct the plume evolution history.
   The method is found to be insensitive to round off errors, but its
   accuracy is affected by plume measurement errors, the extent to which
   the plume has dissipated, and, to a lesser degree, the accuracy of the
   transport parameter estimates. A regularization approach may be
   effective at finding a plume history when there are adequate data.}},

Abstract = {{Constant flux infiltration experiments were performed at rates less than
   saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) on uniform columns of soils and
   glass beads with low initial water contents. Tensiometers measured
   matric pressure (psi) histories at various depths in the 0.05-m
   diameter, 0.73-m-tall columns. One of two devices applied the steady
   fluxes: one was a ceramic plate applicator that allowed monitoring of
   pressures above the plate, and the other was a rain applicator that
   sprinkled water uniformly over the surface. Two columns were used. One
   allowed destructive sampling for water content in a way that prevented
   postrun changes in water content. The other allowed prerun replacement
   of pore air with gases of different solubilities. Contrary to
   predictions based on the Richards equation, transmission zone psi values
   passed through maxima, then decreased continuously as wetting fronts
   moved down columns. Such nonideal behavior was observed in Aiken silt
   loam, Hanford sandy loam, Delhi sand, Oakley sand, and grass beads. At
   an infiltration rate equal to 70\% of K-sat, values of psi at 2, 5, and
   8 cm depths in the glass beads column decreased an average of 52\% from
   their respective maxima in about 3 hours. In the soil columns the
   nonmonotonic behavior was less pronounced but statistically significant
   at all rates examined (3-59\% of K-sat). Matric pressure reversals were
   larger, and corresponding maxima higher, when a given rate was preceded
   by a series of stepwise increasing rates. Tests of possible explanations
   provided no evidence to support hypotheses involving trapped-air
   dynamics, convective air flow, particle rearrangement, or experimental
   artifacts. The results cast doubt on the ability of the Richards
   equation to predict the course of constant flux infiltration including
   the initiation of runoff.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a screening model for flow of a nonaqueous phase liquid
   (NAPL) and associated chemical transport in the vadose zone is
   developed. The model is based on kinematic approximation of the
   governing equations for both the NAPL and a partitionable chemical
   constituent. The resulting governing equation is a first-order,
   quasi-linear hyperbolic equation to which the generalized method of
   characteristics can be applied. This approach generally neglects the
   contribution to the NAPL flux from capillary pressure gradients. During
   infiltration under ponded conditions, or when the NAPL flux exceeds the
   maximum effective conductivity of the soil, the effect of capillary
   suction is included in the model through the usage of the Green-Ampt
   model. All of the resulting model equations are in the form of ordinary
   differential equations which are solved numerically by a variable time
   step Runge-Kutta technique. Results from a simple column experiment were
   used to evaluate the vadose zone flow model assumptions. Independently
   measured parameters allow simulation without calibration of the model
   results. The match of the model to the data suggests that the model
   captures the qualitative behavior of the experimental system and is
   capable of an acceptable degree of quantitative agreement.}},

   scattering analog. Here s(= alpha l/2) is defined as the ratio of the
   characteristic length l of the water supply surface (in fact, its
   radius) to the sorptive length 2 alpha(-1) of the soil and alpha
   satisfies the relationship K(psi) = K(0) e(alpha psi), where K is the
   hydraulic conductivity, and psi is the moisture potential. This exact
   solution cannot be used directly to obtain the separate contributions to
   the mean infiltration rate from the top and the bottom halves of the
   cylinder; our analysis is based on a new class of special functions
   derived from the modified Bessel equation with a forcing term. In this
   paper, we obtain the separate asymptotics for the two halves for large s
   to make a comparison with the results of the trench problem (Waechter
   and Mandal 1993). The asymptotic expansions for top and bottom halves
   are (2/pi)(0.69553s(-2/3)) and (2/pi)(1 + 0.30066s(-2/3)), respectively,
   whereas for a semicircular trench, the mean infiltration rate is given
   by (2/pi)(1 + 0.30066s(-2/3)).}},

Abstract = {{Wells are commonly held at constant drawdown to maximize their discharge
   or to recover nonaqueous phase liquids, but only the simplest cases of
   constant drawdown wells have been treated analytically. In this paper
   the method of instantaneous source functions, which was originally
   limited to cases where the discharges of wells are specified, is
   extended to predict transient discharge and drawdown in the vicinity of
   wells held at constant drawdown. The analysis requires applying a
   Laplace transform to the Duhamel integral, rearranging the resulting
   algebraic expression, and then numerically inverting to obtain the
   discharge function that will result in a constant drawdown at a
   particular location. This approach allows flow problems with a wide
   range of geometries to be analyzed, and it also allows superposition to
   be used for transient problems without violating the condition of
   constant drawdown at the well.}},

Abstract = {{An approach is proposed which allows consideration from common positions
   the self-similar and self-affine properties of river drainage basins and
   which introduces respective characteristics of their fractal structure.
   Horton's (1945) model has been assumed as the basis of this study. It is
   shown that self-similarity of river drainage basins is characterized by
   the self-similarity dimension D-S = In R(B)/ln RL( )In the case of
   self-affinity, two scaling indices D-L = In R(B)/ln R(L) and D-w = In
   R(B)/ln (R(A)/R(L)) are required, the combinations of which determine
   the Hurst H = D-L/D-W index (characterizing the degree of drainage
   basins self-affinity) and the lacunary dimension D-G = 2D(L)D(W)/(D-L +
   D-W) (characterizing the degree of lacunarity or noncompactness of
   drainage basins). On the basis of analysis of published data from rivers
   in the United States, Italy, Russia, and Romania, the conclusion is
   drawn that river drainage basins are generally noncompact (D-G < 2) and
   self-affine (H < 1) fractal objects. Besides, for a quantitative
   description of river drainage basins, a new parameter is introduced,
   which characterizes the degree to which a large catchment is filled with
   smaller ones.}},
