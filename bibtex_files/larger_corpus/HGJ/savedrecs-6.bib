Abstract = {{Hydrologic processes are fundamental in the emplacement of all three
   major categories of sedimentary uranium deposits: syngenetic,
   syndiagenetic, and epigenetic. In each case, the basic sedimentary
   uranium-enrichment cycle involves: (1) leaching or erosion of uranium
   from a low-grade provenance; (2) transport of uranium by surface or
   groundwater flow; and (3) concentration of uranium by mechanical,
   geochemical, or physiochemical processes. Although surface flow was
   responsible for lower Precambrian uranium deposits, groundwater was the
   primary agent in upper Precambrian and Phanerozoic sedimentary uranium
   emplacement. Meteoric or more deeply derived groundwater flow
   transported uranium in solution through transmissive facies, generally
   sands and gravels, until it was precipitated under reducing conditions.
   Syndiagenetic uranium deposits are typically concentrated in reducing
   lacustrine and swamp environments, whereas epigenetic deposits
   accumulated along mineralization fronts or tabular boundaries.
   The role of groundwater is particularly well illustrated in the bedload
   fluvial systems of the South Texas uranium province. Upward migration of
   deep, reducing brines conditioned the host rock before oxidizing
   meteoric flow concentrated uranium and other secondary minerals.
   Interactions between uranium-transporting groundwater and the
   transmissive aquifer facies are also reflected in the uranium
   mineralization fronts in the lower Tertiary basins of Wyoming. Similar
   relationships are observed in the tabular uranium deposits of the
   Colorado Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-system analysis is based on the concept of hierarchical groundwater
   flow systems. The topography of the water table, which is strongly
   related to the topography of the land surface, is a major factor in the
   hierarchical nesting of gravity-driven groundwater flow, resulting in
   flow systems of different orders of magnitude in lateral extent and
   depth of penetration. The concept of flow systems is extremely useful in
   the analysis of spatial and temporal scales and their mutual
   relationships. Basic equations on the laboratory scale are extended to
   larger, regional scales. Making use of Fourier analysis further develops
   Toth's original idea of topography-driven flow systems. In this way, the
   different spatial scales of the water table are separated in a natural
   way, leading to a simple expression for the penetration depth of a flow
   system. This decomposition leads also to the relationship between
   spatial and temporal scales.
   Analogous to flow systems, water bodies with different water quality may
   be called `transport systems.' Field studies, numerical micro-scale
   modeling over macro-scale domains, and stochastic dispersion theory
   indicate that between systems with steady transport, the interfaces are
   relatively thin. The interfaces are much thinner than the relatively
   large mixing zones predicted by the conventional engineering approach to
   macrodispersion in which relatively large, time-independent
   macrodispersion lengths are applied. A relatively simple alternative
   engineering approach is presented. For macrodispersion of propagating
   solute plumes, the alternative dispersion term gives the same results as
   the conventional engineering approach and gives correct results for
   steady-state transport.}},

Journal = {{HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Computer models are commonly used by regulators and managers to make
   predictions regarding groundwater flow and contaminant concentrations at
   various locations and times. However, the uncertainty associated with
   those predictions is often overlooked, despite the fact that an
   assessment of such uncertainty is critical in the formulation of policy
   decisions. One method of quantifying the uncertainty of model
   predictions, based on the collective uncertainties of the model
   parameter input values, is to use an approximation of the three-point
   Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula. The Gauss-Hermite approximation is a
   convenient substitute for simple Monte Carlo sampling, because it
   requires fewer model runs and provides an immediate sensitivity analysis
   of parameter main effects and two-way interactions. For example, a model
   with four parameters, each with its own associated uncertainty, needs to
   be run only 33 times to complete the Gauss-Hermite analysis. For an
   application to a contaminant-transport model, the Gauss-Hermite
   approximation compares well to the full method, with considerable
   savings in computing effort. By comparison, Latin hypercube sampling can
   be more flexible, but it is more complex to use in some circumstances
   and cannot as easily generate the detailed sensitivity analysis that the
   Gauss-Hermite approach offers.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic networks of carbonate rocks usually consist of three types of
   spaces: pores, fissures, and caverns; sometimes filled forms also are
   present. At sufficiently large scales, the spaces are assumed to be
   homogeneous with arbitrary boundaries and to be characterized by mean
   values of parameters. A conceptual model and its schematic presentation
   demonstrate the importance of particular parameters for flow and solute
   transport, and they explain the responses of pumping rates and water
   levels to changes in boundary conditions. Three examples characterize
   some typical networks: (1) chalk in eastern Poland, representing
   fissured aquifers with a high storage volume for solutes in stagnant
   matrix water; (2) Middle Triassic limestones in southern Poland,
   representing fissured-cavernous aquifers; however, a large storage
   volume for solute transport is in mostly stagnant matrix water; and (3)
   Triassic dolomites in the same area, representing
   porous-fissured-cavernous aquifers with a considerable storage volume in
   the matrix, which can partly be released (20\%), considerably
   contributing to the total specific yield. For the last two types of
   aquifers, the hydraulic conductivity near pumping wells and mine
   galleries usually quickly increases in time due to suffosion of filled
   forms, which leads to a temporal large increase of the inflows.}},

   and PATH3D were used to assess bedrock-aquifer susceptibility to
   contamination. Estimated travel time from water table to bedrock surface
   ranges from <0.25 to >512 yr. Spatial distribution of the estimates
   demonstrates that increased travel time to bedrock can result from the
   presence of shallow surface-water bodies, greater depths to bedrock, and
   smaller hydraulic conductivities. Estimated travel times to local
   domestic wells are inversely related to atrazine and desethylated
   atrazine concentrations observed in water from those wells.
   The potential impact of long-term atrazine use on aquifer water quality
   was investigated using MT3D in two best-case scenarios. Uncertainties
   associated with predicted atrazine concentrations at various depths and
   times were estimated. For shallow groundwater, widespread violations of
   Wisconsin's current preventive action limit were predicted, but with
   large uncertainty stemming from uncertain estimates of input parameter
   values. The simulations indicate, however, that moderate inputs at the
   water table are very unlikely to produce violations of Wisconsin's
   standards deeper in the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The Basin of the Valley of Mexico is a closed basin of 9600 km(2), where
   average annual precipitation (1980-55) is 746 mm (226.7 m(3)/s).
   Calculated actual evapotranspiration, is 72-79\% of the precipitation.
   The surrounding mountain ranges of the Sierra de Las Cruces, Sierra
   Nevada, and Sierra Chichinautzin are the main recharge areas for the
   enclosed Basin, in decreasing order,
   Calculated recharge rate is a maximum of 19 m(3)/s in the Metropolitan
   Zone,:whereas a recent estimate of the groundwater exploitation rate
   indicates that 51.35 m(3)/s is being withdrawn from the Basin aquifer
   systems, resulting in a deficit of more than 30 m(3)/s. Taking into
   account infiltration processes by leaking water-supply systems, the
   calculated deficit is reduced to 20.5 m(3)/s. Overexploitation of the
   natural aquifer systems is also indicated by an average annual decline
   of Im of the potentiometric levels of the shallow groundwater systems.
   Possible solutions include: (1) the use of surface runoff water (unused
   amount in 1995:17.6 m(3)/s) for consumption purposes, which is currently
   pumped to areas outside the Basin; (2) an increased number and capacity
   of treatment plants; (3) the renovation of the leaky water-distribution
   network; (4) the reinjection of treated water, and (5) possible
   exploitation of deep regional aquifer systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Valley of Hermosillo coastal aquifer, state of Sonora, northwestern
   Mexico, has been overexploited for the last four decades, in order to
   maintain agricultural activity in one of the most important irrigation
   districts of the Mexican Republic. The over-exploitation has resulted in
   the development of several drawdown cones and in the lowering of the
   water table to as much as 50 m below mean sea level. Contamination of
   the aquifer in the form of salt-water intrusion from the Gulf of
   California and high nitrate concentrations is the consequence of human
   activities. A hydrogeochemical zonation of the aquifer, based on the
   presence of differ ent water families, led to the identification of a
   coastal band approximately 30 km wide that is affected by saltwater
   intrusion. Conductivity of the sampled water and the interpretation of
   the ratio Na/Cl x 1000 was used to identify the location of three major
   intrusion plumes in this coastal band. The background nitrate
   contamination of the aquifer is about 4 ppm, but contents as great as
   about 17 ppm occur in some wells. Irrigation with raw sewage and
   movement of contaminants in areas of high hydraulic gradients within the
   drawdown cones probably are responsible for localized peaks of the
   nitrate concentration.}},

Abstract = {{The southern Voltaian Sedimentary Basin underlies an area of about 5000
   km(2) in east-central Ghana. Groundwater in the basin occurs in
   fractures in highly consolidated siliciclastic aquifers overlain by a
   thin unsaturated zone. Aquifer parameters were evaluated from available
   aquifer-test data on 28 shallow wells in the basin.
   Hydraulic-conductivity values range from 0.04-3.6 mid and are about two
   orders of magnitude greater than the hydraulic conductivity calculated
   using Darcy's Law and the average groundwater velocity estimated from
   carbon-14 dating. Linear-regression analysis of the transmissivity and
   specific-capacity data allowed the establishment of an empirical
   relationship between log transmissivity and log specific capacity for
   the underlying aquifers.
   Groundwater chemistry in the basin is controlled by the weathering of
   albitic plagioclase feldspar. The weathering rates of various minerals
   were estimated using C-14-derived average velocity in the basin. The
   weathering rate of albite was calculated to be 2.16 mu mol L-1 yr(-1)
   with the resulting formation of 3.3 mu mol L-1 yr(-1) of kaolinite and
   0.047 mu mol L-1 yr(-1) of calcite. The low porosity and permeability of
   the aquifers in the basin are attributed to the precipitation of
   secondary minerals on fracture surfaces and interlayer pore spaces.}},

Abstract = {{Deep-well injection has been used to dispose of municipal liquid wastes
   in southwestern Florida since 1988. The liquid wastes are injected into
   an extremely high-transmissivity zone of fractured dolomite in the Early
   Eocene Oldsmar Formation of the Floridan aquifer system; this zone is
   commonly referred to as the Boulder Zone. Data collected during the
   drilling and operational testing of southwestern Florida injection
   wells,provide insights into the nature of the injection zone and
   overlying confining beds. The location of high-transmissivity zones that
   are capable of accepting large quantities of waste water is vertically
   and horizontally variable and cannot be predicted with certainty. A
   40.9-m thick high-permeability interval in one injection well, for
   example, was absent in a well drilled only 85.4 m away. Some upward
   migration of low-density injected fluids has occurred, but at no site
   were the injected liquids detected in deep monitor wells, such as
   occurred at injection-well sites along the coasts of southeastern,
   west-central, and east-central Florida. The primary confinement of the
   injected liquids (i.e., deepest effective confining beds) consists of
   unfractured beds of low-permeability dolomite within the Oldsmar
   Formation, whose locations are also laterally and vertically-variable.
   The origin and controls of the distribution of fractures in the Oldsmar
   Formation are poorly understood.}},

Abstract = {{The Gaza Strip coastal aquifer is under severe hydrological stress due
   to over-exploitation. Excessive pumping during the past decades in the
   Gaza region has caused a significant lowering of groundwater levels,
   altering in some regions the normal transport of salts into the sea and
   reversing the gradient of groundwater flow. The sharp increase in
   chloride concentrations in groundwater indicates intrusion of seawater
   and/or brines from the western part of the aquifer near the sea.
   Simulations of salt-water intrusion were carried out using a
   two-dimensional density-dependent flow and transport model SUTRA (Voss
   1984). This model was applied to the Khan Yunis section of the Gaza
   Strip aquifer. Simulations were done under an assumption that pumping
   rates increase according to the rate of population growth, or about
   3.8\% a year. Model parameters were estimated using available field
   observations. Numerical simulations show that the rate of seawater
   intrusion during 1997-2006 is expected to be 20-45 m/yr, The results
   lead to a better understanding of aquifer salinization due to seawater
   intrusion and give some estimate of the rate of deterioration of
   groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{In order to characterize the hydraulic properties of an aquifer in
   Finland comprising two subvertical fracture zones, observation-well
   responses were matched with generalized radial flow (GRF) type curves.
   The responses in six wells out of seven are consistent with the GRF
   model. The fractional flow dimensions (1-1.2 and 1.5) were determined by
   regression analysis of straight-line slopes and type-curve matching. In
   each test, the flow dimensions in the neighboring fracture zone range
   from 2-2.25. Comparisons of the late-time responses with the asymptotic
   GRF solution and the flow dimensions obtained by reversing the pumping
   and observation points suggest homogeneous hydraulic properties.
   Deviations in responses can be explained by flow-path tortuosity. After
   assessments of the extent of the flow and radial distances along the
   fracture system, hydraulic conductivities and storativities were
   determined from the results of the type-curve matching procedure. The
   obtained hydraulic conductivities are 1.3x10(-5) to 7.9x10(-5) m/s and
   5.0x10(-6) to 2.5x10(-5) m/s for the western and the eastern fracture
   zones, respectively. The results were verified by applying them to
   analytical solutions for pumping wells. The calculated pumping-well
   responses are consistent with the observations. The analysis of flow
   dimension also enhances qualitative interpretations on the hydrogeology
   of fracture zones.}},

Abstract = {{A method was devised for designing configurations of monitoring wells,
   consisting of vertically nested intakes in boreholes. The network-design
   method involves analyzing a subset of potential contaminant plumes
   emerging from the downgradient margin of a landfill, Plume widths are
   evaluated along selected equipotential lines and compared to the lengths
   of those lines, The method was applied to a 32-ha solid-waste landfill
   in Tarrant County, Texas, USA. Sixty-nine potential source nodes were
   considered. A 15-bore-hole network devised by the method registered 93
   detections in total, detecting all 69 model-generated plumes by at least
   one borehole. Based on an enumeration procedure, a minimum of 10
   boreholes was needed to detect all of the model-generated plumes.
   However, the less conservative 10-borehole network had little capability
   for backup detection. An existing monitoring network of seven
   downgradient wells detected only 38 model-generated plumes. Results of
   this study illustrate a practical need for structured approaches to
   designing detection-based groundwater-monitoring configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Land subsidence in the form of sinks has occurred on and near farmlands
   near Tucson, Pima County, Arizona, USA. The sinks occur in alluvial
   deposits along the flood plain of the Santa Cruz River, and have made
   farmlands dangerous and unsuitable for farming. More than 1700 sinks are
   confined to the flood plain of the Santa Cruz River and are grouped
   along two north-northwestward-trending bands that are approximately
   parallel to the river and other flood-plain drainages. An estimated
   17,000 m(3) of sediment have been removed in the formation of the sinks.
   Thirteen trenches were dug to depths of 4-6 m to characterize
   near-surface sediments in sink and nonsink areas. Sediments below about
   2 m included a large percentage of dispersive clays in sink areas.
   Sediments in nonsink areas contain a large component of medium- to
   coarse-grained, moderately to well sorted sand that probably fills a
   paleochannel. Electromagnetic surveys support the association of silts
   and clays in sink areas that are highly electrically conductive relative
   to sand in nonsink areas. Sinks probably are caused by the near-surface
   process of subsurface erosion of dispersive sediments along pre-existing
   cracks in predominantly silt and clay sediments. The pre-existing cracks
   probably result from desiccation or tension that developed during
   periods of water-table decline and channel incision during the past 100
   years or in earlier periods.}},

   needs to consider the vertical head gradients and aquifer anisotropy
   that may be present. This paper presents a method to calculate vertical
   head gradients using water-level measurements made during drilling of a
   partially penetrating well; the gradient is then used to estimate
   interface depth. Application of the method to a numerically simulated
   fresh-water/salt-water system shows that the method is most accurate
   when the gradient is measured in a deeply penetrating well. Even using a
   shallow well, the method more accurately estimates the interface
   position than does the Ghyben-Herzberg relation where substantial
   vertical head gradients exist. Application of the method to field data
   shows that drilling, collection methods of water-level data, and aquifer
   inhomogeneities can cause difficulties, but the effects of these
   difficulties can be minimized.}},

Abstract = {{A geophysical survey was conducted to determine the depth of the base of
   the water-table aquifer in the southern part of Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
   USA. Audio-magnetotellurics (AMT) measurements at 77 sites in the study
   area yielded electrical-resistivity ions of the subsurface, and these
   were used to infer lithologic changes with depth. A 100-600 ohm-m
   geoelectric layer, designated the Jackson aquifer, was used to represent
   surficial saturated, unconsolidated deposits of Quaternary age. The
   median depth of the base of the Jackson aquifer is estimated to be 200
   ft (61m), based on 62 sites that had sufficient resistivity data.
   AMT-measured values were kriged to predict the depth to the base of the
   aquifer throughout the southern part of Jackson Hole. Contour maps of
   the kriging predictions indicate that the depth of the base of the
   Jackson aquifer is shallow in the central part of the study area near
   the East and West Cros Ventre Buttes, deeper in the west near the Teton
   fault system, and shallow at the southern edge of Jackson Hole
   Predicted, contoured depths range from 100 ft (30 m) in the south, near
   the confluences of Spring Creek and Flat Creek with the Snake River, to
   700 ft (210 m) in the west, near the town of Wilson, Wyoming.}},

Abstract = {{One-third of the population of Oman depends upon groundwater extracted
   from the alluvium of the Batinah Plain, on the coast of the Gulf of
   Oman. Deep geophysical exploration techniques were used to determine the
   depth and nature of the alluvium and the boundaries of the aquifer. The
   base and structural controls of the alluvial basin at its contact with
   Tertiary marine sediments and Cretaceous ophiolite were mapped with
   seismic reflection data, recorded originally for oil exploration. The
   base of the alluvium dips northward from the foothills of the Northern
   Oman Mountains, reaching a maximum depth of 2000 m at the coast. The
   varying facies of the alluvium are grossly characterised by different,
   overlapping ranges of electrical resistivity, depending largely on the
   clay content and degree of cementation. Resistivities near the coast are
   reduced by saline intrusion. These variations of resistivity were mapped
   with time-domain electromagnetic sounding along 400 km of profile, to
   distinguish among the three zones of the alluvial aquifer. The wedge of
   saline intrusion was also delineated, up to 10 km from the coast. The
   thickness of the saturated gravel aquifer ranges from 20-160 m in an
   area greater than 600 km(2).}},

Abstract = {{The Cross River State, Nigeria, is underlain by the Precambrian-age
   crystalline basement complex and by rocks of Cretaceous to Tertiary age.
   The exploration for groundwater in this area requires a systematic
   technique in order to obtain optimum results, but the non-availability
   of funds and facilities has made it extremely difficult to carry out
   site investigations prior to the drilling of water wells. Therefore, the
   failure rate is as high as 80\%, In order to delineate areas that are
   expected to be suitable for future groundwater development, black and
   white radar imagery and aerial photographs were used to define some
   hydrological and hydrogeological features in parts of the study area.
   Lineament and drainage patterns were analysed using length density and
   frequency. Lineament-length density ranges from 0.04-1.52; lineament
   frequency is 0.11-5.09; drainage-length density is 0.17-0.94, and the
   drainage frequency is 0.16-1.53. These range of values reflect the
   differences in the probability of groundwater potentials. Results were
   then used to delineate areas of high, medium, and low groundwater
   potential. Study results also indicate that correlations exist between
   lineament and drainage patterns, lithology, water temperature, water
   conductivity, well yield, transmissivity, longitudinal conductance, and
   the occurrence of groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{In Taiwan, rapid economic growth, rising standards of living, and an
   altered societal structure have in recent years put severe demands on
   water supplies. Because of its stable quantity and quality, groundwater
   has long been a reliable source of water for domestic, agricultural, and
   industrial users, but the establishment of a management program that
   integrates groundwater and surface-water use has been hampered by the
   lack of groundwater data. In 1992, the Department of Water Resources
   (DWR) initiated a program entitled ``Groundwater Monitoring Network Plan
   in Taiwan.'' Under this program, basic groundwater data, including
   water-level and water-quality data, are being collected, and a reliable
   database is being established for the purpose of managing total water
   resources. This paper introduces the goals, implementation stages, and
   scope of that plan. The plan calls for constructing 517 hydrogeologic
   survey stations and 990 groundwater monitoring wells within 17 years.
   Under this program, water-level fluctuations are continuously monitored,
   whereas water-quality samples are taken for analysis only at the initial
   drilling stage and, subsequently, at the time when a monitoring well is
   being serviced. In 1996, the DWR and the Water Resources Planning
   Commission were merged to form today's Water Resources Bureau.}},

Abstract = {{The Judea Group, a limestone and dolomite karstic aquifer of late
   Albian-Turonian age, is one of the most important sources of water in
   Israel. In the western part of the country, the Judea Group aquifer is
   also known as the Yarkon-Taninim basin. In the northern Negev, the Judea
   Group is a recipient for fresh water flowing southward from the Hebron
   Mountains and of brackish paleowater flowing northward from Sinai. Very
   little is known of the hydraulic properties of this aquifer. In order to
   outline assumed natural flow paths that existed in this karstic
   environment prior to groundwater exploitation, use was made of
   lithological, structural, and paleomorphological features. A detailed
   hydrogeological conceptual model of the Judea Group aquifer in northern
   Negev was established by the geological interpretation of
   high-resolution seismic reflection and by analysis of lithological
   evidence from boreholes. Isopach, isolith-contour, and isolith-ratio
   maps were compiled for the main lithological components, Increase in
   transmissivity values is inversely proportional with the cumulative
   thickness of argillaceous components. The lithological and hydraulic
   evidence provides the basis for subdividing the subsurface into
   distinctive permeability zones for the upper and lower sections of the
   aquifer; for outlining possible preferential groundwater flow paths for
   both subaquifers; and for improving understanding of groundwater-salinty
   variations that result from lithological variability, direction of
   groundwater flow paths, groundwater flow rates, and the duration of
   rock/water interactions. In an earlier conceptual model of the basin,
   the Judea Group aquifer was regarded as a continuous and undisturbed
   entity. The present study reveals an intricate ground water flow pattern
   that is controlled by lithological and structural factors that create
   zones of preferential flow. This interpretation bears on the overall
   evaluation of groundwater resources and their management and
   exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{A method for general assessment of groundwater vulnerability was
   developed using the concept of hydrogeological settings by which a
   small-scale landscape can be represented by larger units on the map.
   For accidental spills, the time available for remedial actions is
   crucial. Travel times to the saturated zone or to a depth of 5 m are
   classified in four intervals, ranging from < 1 day to > 1 yr.
   Total particle surface available for retention of pollutants in the
   unsaturated zone is used as a semi-quantitative indicator of
   vulnerability in a long-term perspective, This indicator is classified
   into four intervals, ranging from < 1 x 10(6) m(2)/m(2) to > 25 x 10(6)
   m(2)/m(2). The quality of the surfaces is not assessed. However, the
   absence of an intact soil profile is estimated to result in an increase
   in vulnerability by one class.
   Application of the methodology was demonstrated in an area south of
   Stockholm, Sweden. The digital geological map was processed using GIS to
   delineate four defined hydrogeological settings and vulnerability
   classes. Compared with an existing vulnerability map based on
   stratigraphic zoning, the hydrogeological settings allow a site to be
   interpreted in its hydrogeological context, and the use of quantitative
   vulnerability indicators increase the usefulness in practical planning
   and management.}},

Abstract = {{Flow of groundwater with variable density and viscosity was simulated at
   the Atikokan Research Area (ARA) in northwestern Ontario, Canada. An
   empirical viscosity-concentration equation was modified to include
   total-dissolved-solids (TDS) data from the ARA, The resulting equation
   was used successfully to estimate reasonably accurate viscosity values
   over the expected range of temperature and concentration, in comparison
   with experimental values derived for sodium chloride solutions. A
   three-dimensional finite-element code, MOTIF, developed by Atomic Energy
   of Canada Limited, was used in the simulations. The inclusion of the
   effects of depth-increasing temperature and TDS-dependent fluid-density
   distribution, while maintaining only a temperature-dependent viscosity
   relationship in a simulation, resulted in a more penetrative flow
   against expected buoyancy effects (i.e., the physics of the system was
   not honored). Accounting for concentration in the viscosity equation
   caused water to be less penetrative and more in accordance with the
   expected physics of the system. A conclusion is that fluid concentration
   should be considered simultaneously in calculating the density and
   viscosity of a fluid during modeling of variable-density flow in areas
   underlain by fluids with high TDS. Results of simulations suggest that
   both flow directions and magnitudes should be employed simultaneously
   during the calibration of a model. Large-scale groundwater movement in
   the ARA may be analyzed with carefully selected vertical no-flow
   boundaries. By incorporating the geothermal temperature gradient,
   groundwater recharge increases by 12\%, thus, this gradient plays a
   significant role in groundwater flow at the ARA. Variability in the
   fluid concentration at the ARA neither decreases nor increases recharge
   into the groundwater system. The hypothesis that an isolated continuous
   regional flow system may exist at depth in the ARA is not supported by
   these simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer
   seems to increase as the portion of the aquifer tested increases. To
   date, such studies have all relied on different methods to determine
   hydraulic conductivity at each scale of interest, which raises the
   possibility that the observed increase in hydraulic conductivity is due
   to the measurement method, not to the scale. This study analyzes
   hydraulic conductivity with respect to scale during individual aquifer
   tests in porous, heterogeneous carbonate rocks in southeastern
   Wisconsin, USA. Results from this study indicate that hydraulic
   conductivity generally increases during an individual test as the volume
   of aquifer impacted increases, and the rate of this increase is the same
   as the rate of increase determined by using different measurement
   methods. Thus, scale dependence of hydraulic conductivity during single
   tests does not depend on the method of measurement. This conclusion is
   supported by 22 of 26 aquifer tests conducted in porous-flow-dominated
   carbonate units within the aquifer. Instead, scale dependency is
   probably caused by heterogeneities within the aquifer, a conclusion
   supported by digital simulation. All of the observed types of
   hydraulic-conductivity variations with scale during individual aquifer
   tests can be explained by a conceptual model of a simple heterogeneous
   aquifer composed of high-conductivity zones within a low-conductivity
   matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Measured hydraulic conductivity increases with the scale of testing, but
   the reason for this increase is not clear. Possibly, high-conductivity
   heterogeneities are more effective in raising hydraulic conductivity
   over the regional scale than at the local scale. Alternatively, borehole
   skin and storage effects, among others, can systematically bias the
   results of small-scale tests; thus, the increase may simply be an
   artifact of the test method.
   Radial-flow tests were simulated at various scales in digital models of
   fractured double-porosity media. The mean hydraulic conductivity
   increases until the radius of influence in the test exceeds the fracture
   spacing. Therefore, under radial flow, hydraulic conductivity is indeed
   dependent on measurement scale.
   The increase in hydraulic conductivity with scale is a natural
   consequence of heterogeneity. Over short distances, water converging
   toward a borehole must generally flow across heterogeneities. Therefore,
   small-scale tests tend to measure a weighted harmonic mean of the
   hydraulic-conductivity field. Over a large area, however, flow is
   primarily along high-conductivity heterogeneities. Therefore,
   large-scale tests approach a weighted arithmetic mean where
   high-conductivity heterogeneities have a greater influence.}},

Abstract = {{The coastal aquifer system of southern Oahu, Hawaii, USA, consists of
   highly permeable volcanic aquifers overlain by weathered volcanic rocks
   and interbedded marine and terrestrial sediments of both high and low
   permeability. The weathered volcanic rocks and sediments are
   collectively known as caprock, because they impede the free discharge of
   groundwater from the underlying volcanic aquifers. A cross-sectional
   groundwater flow and transport model was used to evaluate the
   hydrogeologic controls on the regional flow system in southwestern Oahu.
   Controls considered were: (a) overall caprock hydraulic conductivity;
   and (b) stratigraphic variations of hydraulic conductivity in the
   caprock. Within the caprock, variations in hydraulic conductivity,
   caused by stratigraphy or discontinuities of the stratigraphic units,
   are a major control on the direction of groundwater flow and the
   distribution of water levels and salinity. Results of cross-sectional
   modeling confirm the general groundwater flow pattern that would be
   expected in a layered coastal system. Groundwater flow is: (a)
   predominantly upward in the low-permeability sedimentary units; and (b)
   predominantly horizontal in the high-permeability sedimentary units.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater in alluvial aquifers of the Wakatipu and Wanaka basins,
   Central Otago, New Zealand, has a composition expressed in equivalent
   units of Ca2+ much greater than Mg2+ congruent to Na+ > K+ for cations,
   and HC0(3)-much greater than SO42- > NO3- congruent to Cl- for anions.
   Ca2+ and HCO3- occur on a 1:1 equivalent basis and account for > 80\% of
   the ions in solution. However, some groundwater has increased
   proportions of Na+ and SO42- reflecting a different source for this
   water. The rock material of the alluvial aquifers of both basins is
   derived from the erosion and weathering of metamorphic Otago Schist
   (grey and green schists). Calcite is an accessory mineral in both the
   grey and green schists at < 5\% of the rock. Geological mapping of both
   basins indicates that dissolution of calcite from the schist is the only
   likely mechanism for producing groundwater with such a constant
   composition dominated by Ca2+ and HCO3- on a 1:1 equivalent basis.
   Groundwater with higher proportions of Na+ and SO42- occurs near areas
   where the schist crops out at the surface, and this groundwater
   represents deeper and possibly older water derived from basement fluids.
   Anomalously high K+ in the Wakatipu basin and high NO3- concentrations
   in the Wanaka basin cannot be accounted for by interaction with basement
   lithologies, and these concentrations probably represent the influence
   of anthropogenic sources on groundwater composition.}},

Abstract = {{Due to rapid economic growth in the Pingtung Plain of Taiwan. the use of
   groundwater resources has changed dramatically. Over-pumping of the
   groundwater reservoir, which lowers hydraulic heads in the aquifers, is
   not only affecting the coastal area negatively but has serious
   consequences for agriculture throughout the plain. In order to determine
   the safe yield of the aquifer underlying the plain, a reliable estimate
   of groundwater recharge is desirable. In the present study, for the
   first time, the chloride mass-balance method is adopted to estimate
   groundwater recharge in the plain. Four sites in the central part were
   chosen to facilitate the estimations using the ion-chromatograph and
   Thiessen polygon-weighting methods. Based on the measured and calculated
   results, in all sites, including the mountain and river boundaries,
   recharge to the groundwater is probably 15\% of the annual rainfall,
   excluding recharge from additional irrigation water. This information
   can improve the accuracy of future groundwater-simulation and management
   models in the plain.}},

Abstract = {{Waters from five cenotes that are currently being used for aquatic
   recreational activities and that lie along the Cancun-Tulum touristic
   corridor, Mexico, were evaluated hydrochemically to determine whether
   the cenotes may be considered as potential drinking-water sources.
   Several parameters exceed the Mexican Drinking Water Standards (MDWS),
   but since they do not pose a significant health threat, four of the five
   cenotes may be used as drinking-water sources. The common contaminants
   in the Yucatan Peninsula, fecal coliforms and nitrate, are in most cases
   below the MDWS (0-460 MPN/100 mi and 0.31-1.18 mg/L, respectively).
   Although these four cenotes meet the MDWS, a careful groundwater
   management policy needs to be developed to avoid contamination (fecal
   and nitrates) and saltwater intrusion.}},

Abstract = {{The Dammam Formation of Middle Eocene age is one of the major aquifers
   containing useable brackish water in Kuwait. Apart from the paleokarst
   zone at the top, the Dammam Formation in Kuwait consists of 150-200 m of
   dolomitized limestone that is subdivided into three members, on the
   basis of lithology and biofacies. The upper member consists of friable
   chalky dolomicrite and dolomite. The middle member is mainly laminated
   biomicrite and biodolomicrite. The lower member is nummulitic limestone
   with interlayered shale toward the base. Geophysical markers conform to
   these subdivisions. Core analyses indicate that the upper member is the
   most porous and permeable of the three units, as confirmed by the
   distribution of lost-circulation zones. The quality of water in the
   aquifer deteriorates toward the north and east. A potentiometric-head
   difference exists between the Dammam Formation and the unconformably
   overlying Kuwait Group; this difference is maintained by the presence of
   an intervening aquitard.}},

Abstract = {{The total amount of groundwater resources in the middle and upper Odra
   River basin is 5200x10(3) m(3)/d, or about 7.7\% of the disposable
   groundwater resources of Poland. The average modulus of groundwater
   resources is about 1.4 Lis/km(2). Of the 180 `Major Groundwater Basins'
   (MGWB) in Poland, 43 are partly or totally located within the study
   area. The MGWB in southwestern Poland have an average modulus of
   groundwater resources about 2.28 L/s/km(2) and thus have abundant water
   resources in comparison to MGWB from other parts of the country.
   Several types of mineral waters occur in the middle and upper Odra River
   basin. These waters are concentrated especially in the Sudety Mountains.
   Carbon-dioxide waters, with yields of 414 m(3)/h, are the most
   widespread of Sudetic mineral waters.
   The fresh waters of the crystalline basement have a low mineralization,
   commonly less than 100 mg/L; they are a HCO3-Ca-Mg or SO4-Ca-Mg type of
   water. Various hydrochemical compositions characterize the groundwater
   in sedimentary rocks. The shallow aquifers are under risk of atmospheric
   pollution and anthropogenic effects. To prevent the degradation of
   groundwater resources in the middle and upper Odra River basin, Critical
   Protection Areas have been designated within the MGWB.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{3-14}},

Abstract = {{The 1995 Water Consumer Protection Act of Tucson, Arizona, USA
   (hereafter known as the Act) was passed following complaints from Tucson
   Water customers receiving treated Central Arizona Project (CAP) water.
   Consequences of the Act demonstrate the uncertainties and difficulties
   that arise when the public is asked to vote on a highly technical issue.
   The recharge requirements of the Act neglect hydrogeological
   uncertainties because of confusion between ``infiltration{''} and
   ``recharge.{''} Thus, the Act implies that infiltration in stream
   channels along the Central Wellfield will promote recharge in the
   Central Wellfield. In fact, permeability differences between channel
   alluvium and underlying basin-fill deposits may lead to subjacent
   outflow. Additionally, even if recharge of Colorado River water occurs
   in the Central Wellfield, groundwater will become gradually salinized.
   The Act's restrictions on the use of CAP water affect the four
   regulatory mechanisms in Arizona's 1980 Groundwater Code as they relate
   to the Tucson Active Management Area: (a) supply augmentation; (b)
   requirements for groundwater withdrawals and permitting; (c) Management
   Plan requirements, particularly mandatory conservation and water-quality
   issues; and (d) the require ment that all new subdivisions use renewable
   water supplies in lieu of groundwater. Political fallout includes
   disruption of normal governmental activities because of the demands in
   implementing the Act.}},

Abstract = {{Spain is a relatively large European country (ca. 500,000 km(2)) with
   extensive semiarid areas in which there exists a large number of good
   aquifers. In some areas, these aquifers are intensively developed and
   are the most important sources of fresh water. Nevertheless, groundwater
   development and protection has rarely been duly considered by the
   Spanish Water Administration, despite the pressure to remedy this
   situation by various groups of experts, some of them members of the
   Water Administration. The Spanish Committee of the International
   Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH) has been very active during the
   last decade in promoting activities to spread groundwater science,
   technology, and management in Spain and outside, mostly in Latin
   America, and in trying to orient water policy toward issues of
   groundwater. These activities include mainly the organization of
   technical and scientific meetings on current topics such as groundwater
   in the new Water Act, overexploitation, groundwater in water-resources
   planning, groundwater pollution, natural-recharge estimation and others.
   The impact of these activities on the recent water policy of Spain seems
   significant, and the experience gained may be applicable to other
   countries.}},

Abstract = {{``Capture{''} is the increase in recharge and the decrease in discharge
   that occurs when pumping is imposed on an aquifer system that was in a
   previous state of approximate dynamic equilibrium. Regional groundwater
   models are usually used to calculate capture in a two-step procedure. A
   steady-state solution provides an initial-head configuration, a set of
   flows through the boundaries for the modeled region, and the initial
   basis for the capture calculation. The transient solutions provide the
   total change in flows through the boundaries. A difference between the
   transient and steady-state solutions renders the capture calculation.
   When seasonality is a modeling issue, the use of a single initial
   hydraulic head and a single set of boundary flows leads to
   miscalculations of capture. Instead, an initial condition for each
   season should be used. This approach may be accomplished by determining
   steady oscillatory solutions, which vary through the seasons but repeat
   from year to year. A regional groundwater model previously developed for
   a portion of the San Pedro River basin, Arizona, USA, is modified to
   illustrate the effect that different initial conditions have on
   transient solutions and on capture calculations.}},

Title = {{Inverse modeling of groundwater flow in the semiarid evaporitic closed

Journal = {{HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-49}},

Abstract = {{Only minor attention has been given in the past to the study of
   closed-basin hydrogeology in evaporitic environments, because these
   basins usually contain poor-quality groundwater. The motivation for
   hydrogeological research in the Los Monegros area in northeastern Spain
   was the approval in 1986 of a large irrigation project in the Ebre River
   basin. The irrigation of 60,000 ha is planned, partly in an evaporitic
   closed basin containing playa lakes. The project has given rise to
   environmental concerns. The evaluation of the hydrologic impacts of
   irrigation requires quantifying properly the hydrogeology of the area.
   With the available information, a conceptual hydrogeological model was
   formulated that identifies two main aquifers connected through a leaky
   aquitard. On the basis of the conceptual model, a numerical model was
   calibrated under steady-state conditions using the method of
   maximum-likelihood automatic parameter estimation (Carrera and Neuman,
   1986a). The calibrated model reproduces the measured hydraulic heads
   fairly well and is consistent with independent information on
   groundwater discharge. By the solution of the inverse problem, reliable
   parameter estimates were obtained, It is concluded that anisotropy plays
   a major role in some parts of the lower aquifer. The geometric average
   of model conductivity is almost two orders of magnitude larger than the
   average conductivity derived from small-scale field tests. This scale
   effect in hydraulic conductivity is consistent with the findings of
   Neuman (1994) and Sanchez-Vila et al. (1996).}},

Abstract = {{Temporal distributions of the isotopic composition in arid rain storms
   and in the associated runoff were investigated in a small arid rocky
   basin in Israel. Customized rain and runoff samplers provided sequential
   water samples hermetically sealed in high-density PVC bags. In several
   storms where the runoff was isotopically depleted, compared with the
   rainfall, the difference could not be explained by fractionation effects
   occurring during overland flow. A water-balance study relating the
   runoff discharge to rainfall over a rocky watershed showed that the
   entire discharge is produced by a very small segment (1-2 mm) of the
   rain storm. The major objective, therefore, was to provide quantitative
   relations between segments of rainfall (rain showers and rain spells)
   and runoff. The time distribution of the composition of stable isotopes
   (oxygen and hydrogen) was used to quantify the correlation between the
   rain spell's amount and the consequent runoff. The aim of this work was
   to (a) utilize the dynamic variations in the isotopic composition in
   rainfall and runoff and model the magnitude of surface-storage capacity
   associated with runoff processes of overland flow, and (b) characterize
   the isotopic composition of the percolating water with respect to the
   isotopic distribution in rainfall and runoff events. The conceptual
   model postulates an isotopic mixing of overland flow with water within
   the depression storage. A transport model was then formulated in order
   to estimate the physical watershed parameters that control the
   development of overland flow from a certain rainfall period. Part I
   (this paper) presents the results and the assessment of the relative
   depression storage obtained from oxygen-18 and deuterium analyses that
   lead to the physical and mathematical formulation of a double-component
   model of kinematic-wave flow and transport, which is presented in Part
   II (accompanying paper).}},

Abstract = {{A new mathematical method based on a double-component model of kinematic

   arid rain storms and runoff. This model describes the transport and
   delta(18)O evolution of rainfall to overland flow and runoff in an arid
   rocky watershed with uniformly distributed shallow depression storage.
   The problem was solved numerically. The model was calibrated using a set
   of temporal discharge and delta(18)O distribution data for rainfall and
   runoff collected on a small rocky watershed at the Sede Boker
   Experimental Site, Israel. Simulation of a reliable result with respect
   to observation was obtained after parameter adjustment by trial and
   error. Sensitivity analysis and model application were performed. The
   model is sensitive to changes in parameters characterizing the
   depression storage zones. The model reflects the effect of the isotopic
   memory in the water within the depression storage between sequential
   rain spells. The use of the double-component model of kinematic wave
   flow and transport provides an appropriate qualitative and quantitative
   fitting between computed and observed delta(18)O distribution in runoff.}},

   convective storms, which contribute approximately a third of the annual
   precipitation to the Spring Mountains, provide only a small fraction
   (perhaps 10\%) of the recharge to this major upland in southern Nevada,

   Peak Spring Canyon Creek during the period 1978-94 show that snowpacks
   were greatly enhanced during El Nino events.}},

Abstract = {{Aquifers in the arid alluvial basins of the southwestern U.S. are
   recharged predominantly by infiltration from streams and playas within
   the basins and by water entering along the margins of the basins. The
   Tucson basin of southeastern Arizona is such a basin. The Santa Catalina
   Mountains form the northern boundary of this basin and receive more than
   twice as much precipitation (ca. 700 mm/year) as does the basin itself
   (ca. 300 mm/year). In this study environmental isotopes were employed to
   investigate the migration of precipitation basinward through shallow
   joints and fractures. Water samples were obtained from springs and
   runoff in the Santa Catalina Mountains and from wells in the foothills
   of the Santa Catalina Mountains. Stable isotopes (SD and delta(18)O) and
   thermonuclear-bomb-produced tritium enabled qualitative characterization
   of flow paths and flow velocities. Stable-isotope measurements show no
   direct altitude effect. Tritium values indicate that although a few
   springs and wells discharge pre-bomb water, most springs discharge
   waters from the 1960s or later.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorine-36 is a radionuclide with a half-life of 3.01 x 10(5)a. Most
   Cl-36 in the hydrosphere originates from cosmic radiation interacting
   with atmospheric gases. Large amounts were also produced by testing
   thermonuclear devices during 1952-58. Because the monovalent anion,
   chloride, is the most common form of chlorine found in the hydrosphere
   and because it is extremely mobile in aqueous systems, analyses of both
   total Cl- as well as 36Cl have been important in numerous hydrologic
   studies. In almost all applications of 36Cl, knowledge of the initial,
   or pre-anthropogenic, levels of Cl-36 is useful, as well as essential in
   some cases. Standard approaches to the determination of initial values
   have been to: (a) calculate the theoretical cosmogenic production and
   fallout, which varies according to latitude; (b) measure Cl-36 in
   present-day precipitation and assume that anthropogenic components can
   be neglected; (c) assume that shallow groundwater retains a record of
   the initial concentration; (d) extract Cl-36 from vertical depth
   profiles in desert soils; (e) recover Cl-36 from cores of glacial ice;
   and (f) calculate subsurface production of Cl-36 for water that has been
   isolated from the atmosphere for more than one million years. The
   initial value from soil profiles and ice cores is taken as the value
   that occurs directly below the depth of the easily defined bomb peak.
   All six methods have serious weaknesses. Complicating factors include
   Cl-36 concentrations not related to cosmogenic sources, changes in
   cosmogenic production with time, mixed sources of chloride in
   groundwater, melting and refreezing of water in glaciers, and seasonal
   groundwater recharge that does not contain average year-long
   concentrations of Cl-36.}},

Abstract = {{We have known for a long time that the material properties of the
   subsurface are highly variable in space. We have learned that this
   variability is due to the extreme complexity and variation with time of
   processes responsible for the formation of the earth's crust, from plate
   tectonics to erosion, sediment transport, and deposition, as well as to
   mechanical, climatic, and diagenetic effects. As geologists, we learned
   how to ``read{''} this complex history in the rocks and how to try to
   extrapolate in space what we have understood. As physicists, we then
   learned that to study flow processes in such media we must apply the
   laws of continuum mechanics. As mathematicians using analytical methods,
   we learned that we must simplify by dividing this complex continuum into
   a small number of units, such as aquifers and aquitards, and describe
   their properties by (constant) equivalent values. In recent years, as
   numerical modelers, we learned that we now have the freedom to
   ``discretize{''} this complex reality and describe it as an ensemble of
   small homogeneous boxes of continuous media, each of which can have
   different properties. How do we use this freedom? Is there a need for
   it? If the answer is ``yes,{''} how can we assign different
   rock-property values to thousands or even millions of such little boxes
   in our models, to best represent reality, and include confidence levels
   for each selected rock property? As a tribute to Professor Eugene S.
   Simpson, with whom the first author of this paper often discussed these
   questions, we present an overview of three techniques that focus on one
   property, the rock permeability. We explain the motivation for
   describing spatial variability and illustrate how to do so by the
   geostatistical method, the Boolean method, and the genetic method. We
   discuss their advantages and disadvantages and indicate their present
   state of development. This is an active field of research and space is
   limited, so the review is certain to be incomplete, but we hope that it
   will encourage the development of new ideas and approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Information on sediment texture and spatial continuity are inherent to
   sedimentary depositional facies descriptions, which are therefore
   potentially good predictors of spatially varying hydraulic conductivity
   (K). Analysis of complex alluvial heterogeneity in Livermore Valley,
   California, USA, using relatively abundant core descriptions and field
   pumping-test data, demonstrates a depositional-facies approach to
   characterization of subsurface heterogeneity. Conventional textural
   classifications of the core show a poor correlation with K; however,
   further refinement of the textural classifications into channel, levee,
   debris-flow and flood-plain depositional facies reveals a systematic
   framework for spatial modeling of K. This geologic framework shows that
   most of the system is composed of very low-K flood-plain materials, and
   that the K measurements predominantly represent the other, higher-K
   facies. Joint interpretation of both the K and geologic data shows that
   spatial distribution of K in this system could not be adequately modeled
   without geologic data and analysis. Furthermore, it appears that K
   should not be assumed to be log-normally distributed, except perhaps
   within each facies. Markov chain modeling of transition probability,
   representing spatial correlation within and among the facies, captures
   the relevant geologic features while highlighting a new approach for
   statistical characterization of hydrofacies spatial variability. The
   presence of fining-upward facies sequences, cross correlation between
   facies, as well as other geologic attributes captured by the Markov
   chains provoke questions about the suitability of conventional
   geostatistical approaches based on variograms or covariances for
   modeling geologic heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{The migration. dissolution, and subsequent fate of spilled chlorinated
   solvents in the urban alluvial valleys of the southwestern U.S. appear
   to be governed by a unique set of hydrogeologic and geochemical
   processes occurring within terrigeneous elastic depositional systems.
   The alluvial and lacustrine fill of the basins, the trapping of solvents
   in fine-grained sediments beneath the urbanized valley centers, the oxic
   conditions typical of the deeper alluvium, and the contaminant-transport
   patterns produced by large-scale basin pumping combine to produce long
   aqueous-phase plumes derived from the dissolution of trapped chlorinated
   solvents. Although of limited aqueous solubility, these dense solvents
   are sufficiently mobile and soluble in the southwestern alluvial valleys
   to have produced aqueous plumes that have migrated several kilometers
   through the deeper alluvium and have contaminated valuable water-supply
   well fields in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The typical length
   of these plumes and the presence of oxic groundwater indicate that it is
   unlikely that natural attenuation will be a practical remedial option in
   the southwestern alluvial valleys or in other alluvial systems in which
   similar hydrogeologic and geochemical conditions exist.}},

Abstract = {{Effective porosity in solute-transport analyses is usually estimated
   rather than calculated from tracer tests in the field or laboratory.
   Calculated values of effective porosity in the laboratory on three
   different textured samples were compared to estimates derived from
   particle-size distributions and soil-water characteristic curves. The
   agreement was poor and it seems that no clear relationships exist
   between effective porosity calculated from laboratory tracer tests and
   effective porosity estimated from particle-size distributions and
   soil-water characteristic curves. A field tracer test in a
   sand-and-gravel aquifer produced a calculated effective porosity of
   approximately 0.17. By comparison, estimates of effective porosity from
   textural data, moisture retention, and published values were
   approximately 50-90\% greater than the field calibrated value. Thus,
   estimation of effective porosity for chemical transport is highly
   dependent on the chosen transport model and is best obtained by
   laboratory or field tracer tests.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments on heterogeneous porous media (otherwise known as
   intermediate scale experiments, or ISEs) have been increasingly relied
   upon by hydrogeologists for the study of saturated and unsaturated
   groundwater systems. Among the many ongoing applications of ISEs is the
   study of fluid flow and the transport of conservative solutes in
   correlated permeability fields. Recent advances in ISE design have
   provided the capability of creating correlated permeability fields in
   the laboratory. This capability is important in the application of ISEs
   for the assessment of recent stochastic theories. In addition,
   pressure-transducer technology and visualization methods have provided
   the potential for ISEs to be used in characterizing the spatial
   distributions of both hydraulic head and local water velocity within
   correlated permeability fields. Finally, various methods are available
   for characterizing temporal variations in the spatial distribution (and,
   thereby, the spatial moments) of solute concentrations within ISEs. It
   is concluded, therefore, that recent developments in experimental
   techniques have provided an opportunity to use ISEs as important tools
   in the continuing study of fluid flow and the transport of conservative
   solutes in heterogeneous, saturated porous media.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix diffusion has become widely recognized as an important transport
   mechanism. Unfortunately, accounting for matrix diffusion complicates
   solute-transport simulations. This problem has led to simplified
   formulations, partly motivated by the solution method. As a result, some
   confusion has been generated about how to properly pose the problem. One
   of the objectives of this work is to find some unity among existing
   formulations and solution methods. In doing so, some asymptotic
   properties of matrix diffusion are derived. Specifically, early-time
   behavior (short tests) depends only on phi(m)(2)R(m)D/L-m(2), whereas
   late-time behavior (long tracer tests) depends only on phi(m)R(m), and
   not on matrix diffusion coefficient or block size and shape. The latter
   is always true for mean arrival time. These properties help in: (a)
   analyzing the qualitative behavior of matrix diffusion; (b) explaining
   one paradox of solute transport through fractured rocks (the apparent
   dependence of porosity on travel time); (c) discriminating between
   matrix diffusion and other problems (such as kinetic sorption or
   heterogeneity); and (d) describing identifiability problems and ways to
   overcome them.}},
