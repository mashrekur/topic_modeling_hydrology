Abstract = {{Ethoxylated nonionic surfactants are widely used for industrial
   applications and have been considered for environmental remediation
   applications. As a result, an understanding of the sorption and
   transport of nonionic surfactants is important, both for their efficient
   use during remediation applications and for understanding their
   potential fate in the environment. Because ethoxylated nonionic
   surfactants are typically broadly-distributed mixtures containing a
   substantial number of components, an understanding of the influence of
   the surfactant component distribution on the overall mixture behavior is
   also required. In this paper, the sorption behaviors of linear alcohol
   ethoxylates and alkylphenol ethoxylates are examined in the presence of
   three different sorbents, a crushed natural silica, an organic-coated
   crushed natural silica, and a river sediment. Similar sorption behavior
   is observed for all surfactants on all three sorbents, although the
   magnitudes of sorption trends vary with sorbent and surfactant
   properties. In general, sorbed surfactant is enriched in high-EO
   surfactant components at low concentrations, and is enriched in low-EO
   surfactant components at intermediate concentrations. At high
   concentrations, sorbed and solution surfactant compositions approach the
   initial surfactant composition. This behavior is attributed to mixed
   aggregate formation on the solid surface and in solution. The varying
   magnitudes of observed behavior are attributed to differences in surface
   site energies and to surface site heterogeneity. Column transport data
   are presented for a nonionic surfactant mixture, and the results are
   discussed in terms of mixed sorption behavior. Implications of transport
   results for the fate and transport of surfactants in the environment are
   also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A plume of groundwater affected by sulfide oxidation extends 160 m
   downgradient from the Nickel Rim Mine tailings impoundment and
   discharges to a small lake. The plume water has near neutral pH, but
   contains high concentrations of Fe and SO4. Field observations indicate
   that the release of SO4, H+, Fe2+ and other metals and their
   distribution in the aquifer is controlled by the rate of sulfide
   oxidation in the vadose zone of the tailings and by subsequent
   dissolution and precipitation of carbonate and oxyhydroxide mineral
   phases in the tailings and aquifer. Using field-determined aqueous and
   solid geochemistry, a conceptual geochemical model for the site was
   developed. This model accounts for trends in pH and in the
   concentrations of Fe and SO4. The numerical model MINTOX was used in
   conjunction with this conceptual model to simulate sulfide oxidation and
   two-dimensional reactive transport of dissolved sulfide oxidation
   products. Simulated sulfide oxidation and transport are compared to
   trends observed in the field after 35 years of oxidation. Similarity
   between observed and simulated concentrations demonstrates that, when
   used with a well-developed conceptual geochemical model, MINTOX is
   capable of simulating sulfide oxidation and plume evolution at mine
   drainage sites. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{From 1953 to 1958, mine tailings were deposited in an elevated
   impoundment at the Nickel Rim mine, an abandoned Ni-Cu mine near
   Sudbury, Ontario. The oxidation of sulfide minerals, principally
   pyrrhotite (8 wt.\% of tailings), has generated low-pH waters and
   released high concentrations of Fe (up to 9.8 g/l), SO4 (up to 24 g/l),
   dissolved metals (1130 mg/l Al; 698 mg/l Ni) and other dissolved
   constituents. Groundwater flow through the tailings is mainly horizontal
   with velocities of 4-8 m/yr. Iron, SO4 and Mn are moving at groundwater
   velocities and a low-pH front (pH less than or equal to 4.5) is moving
   more slowly than the groundwater velocity. A series of pH zones with pH
   values of 3.0, 4.1, 5.6 and 6.7 is present within the impoundment. The
   occurrence of these zones is attributed to the successive dissolution of
   iron (oxy)hydroxides, aluminum hydroxide and aluminosilicates, siderite
   and calcite. Concentrations of dissolved metals, including Al, Co, Cr,
   Ni and Zn are controlled by the pore-water pH, except for Cu, which is
   controlled by the precipitation of covellite. The dominant secondary
   minerals are goethite, jarosite and gypsum. Accumulations of gypsum and
   jarosite in the oxidation zone have been great enough to cement the
   tailings. The cemented layers limit O-2 diffusion, resulting in longer
   oxidation times for the tailings. High concentrations of Fe and SO4
   presently in the tailings pore-water will discharge from the impoundment
   for at least 50 years. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sheet pile test cells were used to isolate two adjacent segments of a
   long-extant groundwater plume containing volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs), including tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE)
   and their degradation by-products cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (c-DCE) and
   chloroethene (a.k.a. vinyl chloride or VC). One cell was subjected to
   continuous flushing and the other to intermittent (pulsed) flushing for
   over 200 days. Pre-pumping coring and sampling revealed maximum
   contaminant concentrations immediately adjacent to the basal aquitard
   for most analytes in both cells. The single exception to this trend was
   PCE, which showed maximum concentrations 0.5 to 2.5 m above the aquitard
   in the continuously pumped cell. For contaminants other than PCE, the
   contaminant mass within the aquitard was similar to that in the aquifer.
   Substantial ``cleanup{''} was achieved in the aquifer region of both
   test cells, but levels of contamination within the aquitard region of
   the two cells were comparatively unaffected. Regarding overall removal
   efficiency in terms of mass removed per volume of water pumped,
   differences in pre-pumping contaminant distributions and total masses
   among the two cells complicated the comparison. Nevertheless,
   pulsed-pumping was observed to be slightly more efficient than
   continuous pumping at the same rate. The slight efficiency difference is
   attributed to diffusive limitations on contaminant removal from
   low-permeability zones. In this regard, diffusion from the thick
   underlying aquitard was too slow to contribute strongly to contaminant
   `'rebound'' within the time scale of the pumping interruption. We
   postulate that larger differences in efficiency between pulsed and
   continuous pumping would be observed for longer interruption periods, or
   with similar pumping conditions at sites where more of the initial
   contamination is in small scale low-permeability regions (e.g., sorbing
   silty or clayey layers within the aquifer). Overall, this work
   illustrates that contaminant transport and subsurface remediation may be
   influenced not only by (1) spatial variability of the transport medium
   (aquifer), matter reasonably well appreciated, but also by (2) spatial
   variability in pre-remediation contaminant distribution, and (3) the
   nature and extent of contamination in adjacent less permeable regions.

Abstract = {{A numerical model based on the two-phase method of characteristics
   (2PMOC) is developed to account for rate-limited dissolution processes
   and to examine the groundwater and soil gas contamination resulting from
   an immobile non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) residual in water-saturated
   and variably unsaturated field-scale systems. Recently developed
   dissolution rate coefficient correlation formulations are used to
   simulate the rate-limited dissolution processes. One-dimensional aqueous
   simulations are performed to examine differences between these
   correlations by comparing effluent concentrations. Damkohler number
   analysis is used to determine degree of equilibrium for each correlation
   and extent of error introduced by assuming local equilibrium between the
   NAPL and aqueous phases. Mathematical models are also used to simulate
   two-dimensional two-phase flow and contaminant transport to evaluate the
   potential of groundwater contamination resulting from a NAPL residual.
   While the simulation results illustrate the significance of the system
   scale on the rate of mass transfer between phases and the degree of
   equilibrium, the exact extent of the system scale effects remains to be
   answered. The modeling results from this study suggest more efforts to
   address the differences between laboratory and field-scale dissolution
   characteristics before a mature understanding of NAPL dissolution
   processes in subsurface can be achieved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Analytical models can be valuable tools to investigate solute transport
   in porous media. The application of analytical solutions is limited by
   the perception that they are too cumbersome to derive while their
   implementation rests on assumptions that are too restrictive. The
   Green's function method (GFM) was applied to facilitate analytical
   solution of the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) for solute transport
   in uniform porous media with steady one- or two-dimensional flow. The
   GFM conveniently handles different boundary and initial conditions as
   well as multi-dimensional problems. Concise expressions are possible for
   the solute concentration with the GFM. This paper provides a general
   framework to efficiently formulate analytical solutions for many
   transport problems. Expressions for the longitudinal and transversal
   Green's function are presented that can be inserted in the general
   expression to solve a wide variety of transport problems in infinite,
   semi-infinite, and finite media. These solutions can be used to
   elucidate transport phenomena, estimate transport parameters, evaluate
   numerical solution procedures and simulate the movement and fate of
   solutes. An illustration of the GFM is provided by the analytical
   modeling of transport from a planar source of persistent, long-lasting
   contamination. Such a source may be used to represent dissolution from a
   pool of a non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL). Analytical solutions are
   obtained for a first-, second-, and third-type condition in case of a
   planar source; the third-type condition is due to downward flow or
   rate-limited dissolution. Several examples are presented to show the
   effect of source conditions, the sensitivity of NAPL dissolution to
   transport parameters included in the Damkohler and Peclet numbers, and
   upstream dispersion. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An open microcosm method for quantifying microbial respiration and
   estimating biodegradation rates of hydrocarbons in gasoline-contaminated
   sediment samples has been developed and validated. Stainless-steel
   bioreactors are filled with soil or sediment samples, and the
   vapor-phase composition (concentrations of oxygen (O-2), nitrogen (N-2),
   carbon dioxide (CO2), and selected hydrocarbons) is monitored over time.
   Replacement gas is added as the vapor sample is taken, and selection of
   the replacement gas composition facilitates real-time decision-making
   regarding environmental conditions within the bioreactor. This
   capability allows for maintenance of field conditions over time, which
   is not possible in closed microcosms. Reaction rates of CO2 and O-2 are
   calculated from the vapor-phase composition time series. Rates of
   hydrocarbon biodegradation are either measured directly from the
   hydrocarbon mass balance, or estimated from CO2 and O-2 reaction rates
   and assumed reaction stoichiometries. Open microcosm experiments using
   sediments spiked with toluene and p-xylene were conducted to validate
   the stoichiometric assumptions. Respiration rates calculated from O-2
   consumption and from CO2 production provide estimates of toluene and
   p-xylene degradation rates within about +/-50\% of measured values when
   complete mineralization stoichiometry is assumed. Measured values ranged
   from 851.1 to 965.1 g m(-3) year(-1) for toluene, and 407.2-942.3 g
   m(-3) year(-1) for p-xylene. Contaminated sediment samples from a
   gasoline-spill site were used in a second set of microcosm experiments.
   Here, reaction rates of O-2 and CO2 were measured and used to estimate
   hydrocarbon respiration rates. Total hydrocarbon reaction rates ranged
   from 49.0 g m(-3) year(-1) in uncontaminated (background) to 1040.4 g
   m(-3) year(-1) for highly contaminated sediment, based on CO2 production
   data. These rate estimates were similar to those obtained independently
   from in situ CO2 vertical gradient and flux determinations at the field
   site. In these experiments, aerobic conditions were maintained in the
   microcosms by using air as the replacement gas, thus preserving the
   ambient aerobic environment of the subsurface near the capillary zone.
   This would not be possible with closed microcosms. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Contaminant characterization is important for successful remediation of
   non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in the unsaturated zone. A
   partitioning interwell tracer test (PITT) can provide a good estimate of
   average subsurface NAPL saturations. Screening experiments were
   completed in the laboratory to evaluate several gas tracers for a PITT
   study to be completed in the vadose zone at Kirtland Air Force Base in
   Albuquerque, NM. Four perfluorocarbon tracers were found to be suitable
   for this PITT. Further laboratory column studies were completed using
   contaminated field soil to measure the partition coefficients between
   the tracers and the NAPL. The results from the column studies showed
   that the air/NAPL tracer partition coefficients ranged from 8.8 +/- 0.6
   to 71 +/- 3. This range of partition coefficients is suitable for
   detection of NAPL saturations in the field of 0.002 to 0.14. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Forced-gradient groundwater tracer tests may be conducted using a
   variety of hydraulic schemes, so it is useful to have simple
   semi-analytic models available that can examine various
   injection/withdrawal scenarios. Models for radially convergent tracer
   tests are formulated here as transfer functions, which allow complex
   tracer test designs to be simulated by a series of simple mathematical
   expressions. These mathematical expressions are given in Laplace space,
   so that transfer functions may be placed in series by simple
   multiplication. Predicted breakthrough is found by numerically inverting
   the composite transfer function to the time-domain, using traditional
   computer programs or commercial mathematical software. Transport is
   assumed to be dictated by a radially convergent or uniform flow field,
   and is based upon an exact first-passage-time solution of the backward
   Fokker-Planck equation. These methods are demonstrated by simulating a
   weak-dipole tracer test conducted in a fractured granite formation,
   where mixing in the injection borehole is non-ideal. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Containment of groundwater contamination using physical barriers can be
   an important element of a subsurface remediation program. This work
   presents simple analytical tools for predicting the performance of
   barriers in terms of the steady-state contaminant flux across the
   barrier, the duration of the transient period following barrier
   installation, and the time-dependent contaminant concentration
   distribution within the barrier. The analytical expressions are
   developed from approximate boundary layer (BL) solutions to the
   advective-dispersive equation subject to conservative fixed
   concentration boundary conditions. Critical ranges of important
   dimensionless quantities are identified for use in barrier performance
   assessment, for both steady-state and transient conditions. Comparative
   calculations made with the BL equations and more exact semi-analytical
   solutions are used to characterize the accuracy and applicability of the

Abstract = {{In arid and semi-arid environments, artificial recharge or reuse of
   wastewater may be desirable for water conservation, but NO3-
   contamination of underlying aquifers can result. On the semi-arid
   Southern High Plains (USA), industrial wastewater, sewage, and feedlot
   runoff have been retained in dozens of playas, depressions that focus
   recharge to the regionally important High Plains (Ogallala) aquifer.
   Analyses of ground water, playa-basin core extracts, and soil gas in an
   860-km(2) area of Texas suggest that reduction during recharge limits
   NO3- loading to ground water. Tritium and Cl- concentrations in ground
   water corroborate prior findings of focused recharge through playas and
   ditches. Typical delta(15)N values in ground water (>12.5 parts per
   thousand) and correlations between delta(15)N and In CNO3--N suggest
   denitrification, but O-2 concentrations greater than or equal to 3.24 mg
   1(-1) indicate that NO3- reduction in ground water is unlikely. The
   presence of denitrifying and NO3--respiring bacteria in cores, typical
   soil-gas delta(15)N values < 0 parts per thousand, and decreases in
   NO3-- N/Cl- and SO42-/Cl- ratios with depth in cores suggest that
   reduction occurs in the upper vadose zone beneath playas. Reduction may
   occur beneath flooded playas or within anaerobic microsites beneath dry
   playas. However, NO3--N concentrations in ground water can still exceed
   drinking-water standards, as observed in the vicinity of one playa that
   received wastewater. Therefore, continued ground-water monitoring in the
   vicinity of other such basins is warranted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The investigation of contaminated sites is usually a long and expensive
   process. It is therefore desirable to use a combination of methodologies
   in an integrative approach that can reduce redundant information
   gathering. The objective of this study was to examine the usefulness of
   2 non-intrusive exploration techniques in a contaminated site
   investigation. Borehole positioning based on geophysical measurements
   was compared to positioning based on the Bayesian expert system for
   flow-field modeling. The goal set at the field site was the assessment
   of the type and load of contaminants transported from the landfill site
   to the adjacent aquifer and the extent of leachate plumes within the
   groundwater. The two methods made different demands on information
   gathering and were found to be complementary. The geophysical approach
   focused attention on the waste compartments at the site and on mixing
   plumes in the adjacent aquifer but could not, without prior information,
   provided information on the flow field. The Bayesian approach to
   flow-field modeling determined areas of greatest model uncertainty at
   the model boundaries. The model highlighted areas of greatest
   uncertainty that might otherwise have been overlooked and provided
   information on the most likely mean direction of the leachate plumes, it
   was concluded that both methods contribute to a site investigation and
   should be used before additional drilling is carried out. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{EDTA was percolated in laboratory columns through a soil polluted by
   heavy metals to investigate the efficiency of and processes involved in
   soil decontamination by chemical extraction. At high EDTA concentration
   (10(-2) M), elution of Pb and Cd was very efficient for one pore volume,
   after which it decreased to almost zero due to depletion of available Pb
   and Cd and to competition with Ca and Fe slowly solubilized during the
   passage of the EDTA front. Clogging occurred after the end of the EDTA
   plateau. At lower EDTA concentrations (10(-3) and 10(-4) M), elution was
   less efficient, but extraction decreased little with the volume
   percolated; moreover no Ca above background values was dissolved. The
   optimum EDTA concentration for heavy metal extraction ranges between
   10(-2) and 10(-3) M, The higher the concentration, the greater the
   extraction efficiency, but as the EDTA concentration is increased there
   is an optimum point at which clogging takes place and permeability
   decreases. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of contaminants in groundwater is controlled by many factors;
   the most relevant are the formation heterogeneities, the geochemical
   properties of the aquifer and the source size which is a limiting factor
   for the spreading of the contaminant. When the source size is much lager
   than the characteristic scale of the formation heterogeneities, the
   transport develops under ergodic conditions and the spatial moments of
   the plume are not influenced by the source size. In this case, the plume
   samples all the relevant scales of heterogeneity and the spreading of
   the solute reaches its maximum. To date, a number of solutions are
   available for transport under ergodic conditions and only few studies
   address the non-ergodic case, which develops when the source size is of
   the same order of magnitude of the formation integral scale, In this
   paper, we study how the source size affects the transport of linear
   kinetically sorbing solutes, characterized by constant reaction
   parameters. First, the general expressions for the effective plume
   moments in natural formations are obtained by using the Lagrangian
   approach. Then, closed form solutions are provided for instantaneous
   injection over a plane normal to the mean flow direction and in the
   limiting case of large travel times, in addition, we analyze the plume
   moments at small and moderate times in an isotropic two-dimensional
   formation characterized by the Gaussian log-conductivity covariance
   function. We found that the source size is the key factor controlling
   the relative impact on transport of the formation heterogeneities and
   the geochemical properties of the aquifer. In addition, we found that
   the relative importance of the contribution to dispersion stemming from
   the formation heterogeneities increases with the source size.
   Conversely, when the source size is comparable with the Darcy's scale,
   the formation heterogeneities do not contribute to solute spreading,
   which is controlled by the reaction only. The results show also that the
   ergodic conditions for the longitudinal second order moment are obtained
   with a progressively smaller source size as the reaction rates
   increases. Hence, the presence of reaction facilitates the occurrence of
   ergodic transport, which is obtained for plumes significantly smaller
   than for nonreactive solutes transport. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Contaminant diffusion through a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) in
   unsaturated soils may often be an important transport mechanism. A
   diffusion tube technique was used to measure the effective diffusivity
   through NAPL in unsaturated soils as a function of soil type (or pore
   size distribution), water saturation (milliliter water/milliliter void),
   and NAPL saturation (milliliter NAPL/milliliter void). Results indicated
   that the effective diffusivities depended on the `connectivity' of the
   NAPL. This `connectivity' increased with NAPL saturation, but was shown
   to have a more complex relation to the water saturation and pore size
   distribution of the soil. A series of mercury intrusion and extrusion
   experiments was also carried out To characterize the pore size
   distribution and pore `connectivity' of the model soils. Using this
   characterization of the pore size distribution, along with a previously
   developed diffusional resistance model, the effective diffusivity was
   reasonably predicted for the soils and saturations examined in this
   study. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The leachate composition of the Landfill Lostorf, Buchs, Switzerland has
   been examined as a function rain events and dry periods between November
   1994 and November 1996, Discharge and electrical conductivity of the
   central drainage discharge were monitored continuously, whilst samples
   for chemical analysis were taken at discrete intervals. The average
   total concentrations of Na, Cl, K, Mg, Ca and SO4 are 44.5, 47.1, 11.8,
   0.63, 8.2 and 12.4 mM, respectively. During rain events, the leachate is
   diluted by the preferential flow of rainwater into the drainage
   discharge. Drainage discharge pH values range between 8.68 and 11.28,
   the latter under dry conditions. Thermodynamic calculations indicate
   that CaSO4, ettringite (3CaOAl(2)O(3)CaSO(4) . 32H(2)O) and AI(OH), may
   control the concentrations of the components Ca, SO, and Al. Dissolved
   Si may be in thermodynamic equilibrium with either Ca silicate hydrate
   or imogolite. Cadmium, Mo, V, Mn and Zn are also diluted during rain
   events and concentration changes agree with those of conductivity
   (representing the major constituents). Average concentrations are 0.012,
   5.4, 2.3, 0.085, and 0.087 mu M, respectively. Components such as Al,
   Cu, Sb and Cr increase in concentration with increased discharge.
   Average concentrations an 1.6, 0.27 and 0.21 mu M, respectively. For Cu,
   the explanation lies in its affinity for total organic carbon (TOC).
   Thermodynamic calculations indicate th;lt whilst
   dissolution/precipitation reactions with metal hydroxides and carbonates
   can explain the observed concentrations of Cd, sorption and complexation
   reactions probably influence the concentrations of Cu, Pb (average
   measurable concentration 0.013 mu M), Zn and Mn. For the oxyanion
   species such as MoO4 and WO4 (average concentration 0.61 mu M), it is
   probable that Ca metallate formation plays a dominant role in
   determining concentration ranges. Geochemical processes appear to
   determine concentration ranges and the hydrological factors, the
   fluctuations in concentration. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The scale of biogeochemical reactions was studied in a physically and
   chemically heterogeneous surficial Coastal Plain aquifer contaminated by
   a gasoline spill. The physical heterogeneity of the aquifer is
   manifested in two hydrologic units, a shallow local aquifer of perched
   water and a regional sandy aquifer. Over the studied vertical interval
   of 21.3 ft (6.5 m), concentrations of reactive sixties varied by orders
   of magnitude, and the impact of biodegradation,was expressed to widely
   varying degrees. A thin (3 ft thick) section of the perched-water zone
   was the most contaminated; total aromatic hydrocarbons were as high as
   19.4 mg/l, Hydrocarbons were degraded by microbially mediated reactions
   that varied over short vertical distances and time. Anaerobic processes
   dominated within the low-permeability clay unit, whereas in the more
   permeable sandy layers nitrate reduction and aerobic degradation
   occurred. Hydrocarbons were more persistent over time in the
   low-permeability layer due to the limited availability of electron
   accepters for degradation. The microbial degradation of hydrocarbons
   was-linked to sulfate and iron reduction in the clay unit and led to
   alterations in the aquifer solids; electron microscopy revealed the
   presence of FeS minerals encrusting primary aquifer grains. High
   concentrations of Fe2+ in groundwater, up to 34.5 mg/l, persist in
   kinetic disequilibrium in the presence of elevated H2S levels of 1.0
   mg/l. Assessment of aquifer heterogeneities and groundwater
   contamination was possible due to sample discrimination at a scale of
   approximately 2 ft (similar to 0.6 m), a much finer resolution than is
   attempted in many remedial investigations of polluted aquifers. The
   information obtained in this type of study is essential to the
   development of models capable of estimating the fate of hydrocarbons at
   a site scale. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mobilization of residual DNAPL in a contaminated aquifer may be
   problematic for the application of enhanced dissolution remediation
   techniques such as alcohol or surfactant flushing. The objective of this
   study was to investigate the effects of clay fines on residual
   saturation, permeability and the onset of mobilization of PCE during
   alcohol flushing. Column experiments were conducted with soils
   containing 0\%, 2\%, 5\%, 10\%, and 20\% clay that was completely mixed
   within a well-sorted Ottawa sand. Column characterization included
   pressure-saturation relationships, pore-size distribution, permeability,
   and residual saturation. The columns were flushed with isopropyl alcohol
   (TPA) in concentration increments to determine when mobilization of PCE
   occurred. Trapping numbers were calculated. Results showed that
   increasing amounts of clay resulted in decreased hydraulic conductivity,
   increased residual PCE saturation and a larger pore size distribution.
   Residual PCE was found to begin to mobilize in the clay-mixed media at.
   a range of trapping numbers below those reported in the literature for
   homogeneous well-sorted sand. This suggests that the potential to
   mobilize the residual PCE is greater in the mixed media. This may be
   explained by the formation of multi-pore branched ganglia in the
   clay-containing media as opposed to singlet formation in a well-sorted
   media. The multi-pore ganglia may mobilize more readily than singlets
   due to the added force of head acting on the PCE interface where the
   trapping is occurring. Using a narrow range of trapping numbers
   determined in homogeneous media to predict mobilization may not be
   appropriate in mixed media because mobilization was noted at a variety
   of trapping numbers. However, relationships between the trapping
   number:at mobilization and various soil parameters such as the amount of
   clay, residual DNAPL saturation, and pore size distribution, indicate
   that these, coupled with the trapping number, may aid in our ability to
   predict mobilization. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   physical behavior of birnessite, a column packed with birnessite-coated
   sand was injected with a sequence of CaCl2, MgCl2, FeCl2 and KBr
   solutions. The dispersivity of the sediment as a function of the
   solution composition was evaluated from breakthrough curves. The
   birnessite-coated sediment showed in the Mg-form a 4-8 times higher
   dispersion than in the Ca-form. This is related to differences in
   swelling behavior observed with X-ray diffraction at 0\% relative
   humidity. After reduction of delta-MnO2 with FeCl2 and precipitation of
   Fe(OH)(3), the dispersion is 10-15 times higher than in the original

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional compositional model CompFlow has been extended to
   allow the simulation of the multiphase advective, dispersive and
   diffusive flux of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants in a
   discrete-fracture network, allowing for phase partitioning and dynamic
   interactions between the fracture network and the surrounding
   low-permeability rock matrix. The approach used to couple fluxes between
   the fractures and matrix allows representation of capillary pressure
   differences within the fractures and matrix and makes no assumption of
   equilibrium hydraulic conditions between the two. The model is verified
   for the case of aqueous-phase solute transport by comparison with an
   analytical solution. An example problem is presented involving the
   migration of a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) consisting of
   trichlorethylene (TCE) in a single vertical fracture within a
   low-permeability material with significant matrix porosity. The
   simulation results demonstrate that matrix diffusion acts to transfer
   significant amounts of contaminant to the matrix in the aqueous phase.
   After the DNAPL source is removed, the NAPL ultimately disappears from
   the fracture due to partitioning of contaminant into the aqueous phase
   with concomitant matrix diffusion. It is shown that as the porosity of
   the matrix increases, the rate of migration of the TCE DNAPL front
   within fractures is retarded, due to dissolution and matrix diffusion.
   The sensitivity of DNAPL migration within the fracture to the form of
   the relative permeability relationship is also discussed. The model is
   then used to highlight the potential for deep DNAPL penetration through
   a vertical cross-section consisting of a shallow unconfined sand aquifer
   and a deeper sand aquifer separated by a layer of fractured clay.
   Vertical fractures through the clay that hydraulically connects the
   shallow and deep aquifers are: shown to be capable of transmitting both
   dissolved contaminant and DNAPL to the underlying aquifer, with DNAPL
   travel times through the 5-m thick clay unit being on the order of days.
   For the scenarios examined, the DNAPL entering the lower aquifer via the
   fractured clay unit may completely dissolve at the aquifer-aquitard
   interface due to lateral groundwater flow in the lower aquifer, provided
   the aperture of the vertical fractures in the clay layer are less than
   about 30 mu m; however, some DNAPLs may penetrate into the lower aquifer
   and exist as a non-aqueous phase if the fracture apertures in the clay
   layer are 50 mu m in size or larger. In this latter case, the presence
   of the DNAPL in the lower aquifer acts as a persistent source of
   groundwater contamination and can produce an extensive plume in the
   direction of groundwater flow. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The perchloroethylene (PCE) sorption distribution coefficient (K-d,
   measured at 40-100 mu g/l solution concentration in batch experiments)
   ranged from 4.0 to 134 l/kg over the sampled thickness (1.0-6.0 m depth)
   of a moderately-low organic carbon (0.002-0.005), fractured and
   weathered diamict (poorly sorted, glacially deposited) aquitard. The
   organic carbon-normalized k(d) (K-oc) for deeper, unoxidized (reduced)
   samples from this deposit(log K-oc = 4.4-4.59) were generally consistent
   with the kerogen in the underlying Devonian-age shale (log K-oc = 4.57),
   a likely sourer rock for these sediments. The similarities between these
   samples suggest that the sorption capacity of the kerogen was minimally
   altered during transport and deposition, and that humic substances were
   not co-deposited with the kerogen in the glacially-deposited sediments.
   The K-oc within the diamict was correlated to the oxidation state of the
   organic matter, characterized by the H/O ratio through elemental
   analysis. The K-oc for more oxidized samples from shallower depth
   samples (log K-oc = 3.35-3.65) were approximately an order of magnitude
   less than these determined for the reduced samples. The K-oc for 1.5- to
   2.5-cm thick oxidation haloes surrounding fractures and characterized by
   visible Fe-oxidation, were approximately 20-30\% lower than the adjacent
   unaltered matrix samples. The linear trend observed between log K-oc and
   log H/O is similar to, but steeper than, the relation reported
   previously, which represents increasing sorption magnitude with
   increasing diagenesis in coal and shale samples. The spatial
   distribution of the K-oc within this aquitard, in concert with
   qualitative geologic observations, suggests that oxidative weathering of
   the native kerogen exerts an important control on hydrophobic organic
   compound sorption. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Microbial activity in aquifers is controlled by the mixing between the
   reacting substrates. Conventional modelling methods that are commonly
   used to analyze reactive transport of organics in heterogeneous systems
   may give erroneous results because mixing is often over-represented in
   the model. This effect will be strangest when the reaction is controlled
   by transverse dispersion as in the case of aerobic degradation of
   waste-water introduced into an aquifer by an injection well. We show
   that fictitious transverse mixing can be created by a numerical model
   based on rectangular grids, and that this problem can be controlled by
   formulating the problem in streamline-oriented coordinates. In both
   model formulations, nonlinear high-resolution techniques minimizing the
   amount of artificial diffusion were applied, so that fictitious mixing
   is exclusively due to grid-orientation effects. Additionally it is shown
   that applying dispersivity values based on the second spatial moment
   transverse to the direction of flow leads to an overestimation of
   mixing. The fictitious degradation produced by model-dependent
   transverse dispersion caused the modelled plume to degrade much faster,
   and therefore appear much shorter, than the actual plume. Thus, the
   choice of appropriate dispersivity values as well as the control of
   artificial transverse diffusion is crucial when modelling
   mixing-controlled reactive transport. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Efficient design of zero-valent metal permeable `barriers' for the
   reduction of organohalides requires information regarding the pertinent
   reaction rates as well as an understanding of the resultant distribution
   of products. In this study, the pathways and kinetics for reaction of
   polychlorinated ethanes with Zn(0) have been examined in batch reactors.
   Reductive p-elimination was the only route through which
   hexachloroethane (HCA), 1,1,1,2-tetrachloroethane (1,1,1,2-TeCA),
   1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (1,1,2,2-TeCA), 1,1,2-trichloroethane
   (1,1,2-TCA) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) reacted. Pentachloroethane
   (PCA) reacted via concurrent reductive beta-elimination (93\%) and
   hydrolysis (7\%). As previously demonstrated, 1,1,1-trichloroethane
   (1,1,1-TCA) and 1,1-dichloroethane (1,1-DCA) reacted predominantly via
   reductive a-elimination. Attempts to correlate BET surface
   area-normalized rate constants (k(SA-BET)) with one-electron reduction
   potential (E-1) met with limited success, as HCA, PCA, 1,1,1,2-TeCA, and
   1,1,1-TCA reacted at nearly identical rates despite substantial
   differences in E-1 values. Comparison of the pseudo-first-order rate
   constants (k(obs)) for these species with rate constants (k(L)a)
   obtained from a correlation for mass transfer to suspended particles
   revealed that the reaction of these species was mass transfer limited
   even though reaction rates were unaffected by mixing speed. Calculations
   suggest that mass transfer limitations may also play a role in the
   design of treatment systems for highly reactive species, with overall
   rate constants predicted to increase with flow velocity. (C) 1999

Title = {{Sorption of trichloroethene onto stylolites}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Batch and double reservoir diffusion cell experiments are used to
   investigate sorption of trichloroethene onto stylolites. Stylolites are
   common features in carbonate rock formations, and might contain high
   amounts of organic matter. Due to the hydrophobic character of TCE, its
   transport in fractured carbonate aquifers could be significantly
   affected due to these aforementioned features. No research has been
   carried out to evaluate the impact of stylolites on organic pollutant
   transport. The main objectives of this experimental research are to
   verify TCE sorption onto stylolites, and to derive sorption and
   diffusion parameters describing the solute/rock interaction. Test
   results show that stylolites from the Lockport Formation in Southern
   Ontario, Canada contain significant amounts of organic carbon.
   Discrepancies are noted between carbon analyzer data and estimates from
   batch experiments and these might be due to TCE sorption also onto a
   clay mineral phase in stylolites or due to selective sampling.
   Adsorption and desorption behavior of TCE is investigated in specially
   designed double reservoir diffusion cells made out of stainless steel
   and Teflon. Three semi-analytical solutions for one-dimensional,
   reactive tracer migration through a porous medium are derived and used
   to evaluate TCE time-concentration profiles. Experimental data can best
   be modeled using a kinetic Langmuir sorption formulation with a maximum
   sorption capacity of 1.3 to 4.6 mu g/g and a kinetic sorption constant
   of 4 x 10(-7) to 5 x 10(-7) l/mg s(-1). TCE desorption into the exit
   reservoir is found to be a very slow kinetic process. No retardation is
   observed during TCE migration through a clay and organic matter free
   dolostone sample. TCE seems not to interact with calcareous mineral
   phases and moves conservatively. Bromide diffusion curves yield geometry
   factors (gamma) for dolostone ranging between 0.05 and 0.13. From this
   study it can be concluded that TCE sorption is of importance when
   modeling TCE migration in fractured, stylolitic limestone aquifers where
   diffusion into the rock matrix takes place. Temporal TCE storage in rock
   matrix stylolites and fracture wall stylolites has to be taken into
   consideration when evaluating actions of remediation at organic spill
   sites. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR) has shown great promise
   in laboratory studies as a technique for removing nonaqueous phase
   liquids (NAPLs) from soils. Failures of SEAR in the field are often
   attributed to the reduction of conductivity of the soil. Conductivity
   may be altered due to changes in Liquid properties, in porous medium
   properties or in both. This study focuses on the changes in liquid
   properties, specifically viscosity and density, in systems comprising
   aqueous solutions of surfactants selected for their solubilization
   potential of NAPLs that are denser than water, such as
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE). Measurements showed that the viscosity of the
   surfactant solutions increased with surfactant concentration, with the
   increase being considerably greater with the addition of ethanol as a
   co-surfactant. The impact of temperature was also substantial, with the
   viscosity increasing as the temperature decreased. The solubilization of
   PCE and the subsequent formation of a dilute emulsion also increased the
   viscosity, but only slightly. This increase could be predicted using
   equations developed for calculating the viscosity of emulsions, even at
   organic liquid concentrations below the point of emulsion formation. The
   density increased somewhat with the solubilization of PCE in the
   surfactant solution. This increase could be estimated from a
   weighted-volume average of the densities of PCE and the surfactant
   solution. The resultant reductions in conductivity calculated based on
   the measured changes in viscosity and density ranged from about 26\% to
   73\% at a surfactant concentration of 4\% and a PCE concentration of
   40-50 g/l, depending on the temperature, the type of surfactant and the
   ethanol concentration. Since some laboratory studies, particularly those
   employing fine-grained soils, have reported reductions in conductivity
   greater than those determined here, changes in porous medium properties
   must contribute to conductivity reductions as well. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Bioremediation has become an important remediation technology during the
   past few years. However, limited understanding of processes, data
   limitations and parameter uncertainty, and computationally intensive
   numerical solutions have reduced the interest to perform detailed
   field-scale modeling, especially with non-linear Monod expressions. In
   this paper, the focus was computational efficiency where a simplified
   numerical algorithm was developed to solve the non-linear reactions
   between the hydrocarbon, oxygen, nitrate, and a heterotrophic
   facultative microbial population. The numerical algorithm was presented
   using a commonly adapted conceptual model of reaction kinetics between
   different species with multi-term Monod expressions. The accuracy and
   efficiency of the algorithm were tested with an iterative solution using
   the Runge-Kutta method. Simulation results obtained from reaction only
   and one-dimensional advection-dispersion-reaction transport examples
   showed good accuracy while maintaining numerical stability. In general,
   the accuracy increased with contaminant concentrations relatively higher
   than the corresponding half-saturation constant. Also, the simplified
   algorithm is found to be much more computationally efficient than the
   iterative technique. The gain in computational efficiency was at least
   threefold and this gain increased with the increase of time step. Future
   work will explore the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed simplified
   algorithm with field-scale scenarios related to intrinsic and enhanced
   bioremediation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) as
   interfacial tracers to measure non-aqueous phase Liquid (NAPL)-water
   interfacial areas (a(nw)) in columns packed with silanized glass beads
   which were coated with either n-decane or perchloroethylene (PCE). The
   consistency of the interfacial tracer technique was evaluated by showing
   that: (1) a(nw) values measured with two tracers for two NAPLs were
   similar; (2) the interfacial adsorption isotherm estimated from the
   surfactant retardation factors was comparable to that predicted from
   interfacial tension data and the Gibbs adsorption equation; and (3) the
   measured a(nw) values were comparable with those estimated from a simple
   geometrical analysis of the solid surface area of the glass beads of
   known size and shape. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The sorption of benzofuran, dibenzofuran, benzothiophene, and
   dibenzothiophene from water on natural clayey till from two locations in
   Denmark was investigated in single solute systems for a large range of
   solute concentrations. The variation in sorption of a basic (quinoline)
   and a neutral (dibenzofuran) heterocyclic compound in samples from
   different depths in the natural clayey till was also investigated. The
   sorption isotherms for all four compounds and both clayey tills were
   highly non-linear, and the overall best fits were obtained with
   Freundlich isotherms. These observations indicate that sorption is not
   strictly hydrophobic or that the affinity for organic material is
   influenced by the sorbed solute, and that multiple components contribute
   to the sorption. The f(oc) normalized Linear K-d-value and Freundlich
   K-f-coefficient were compared with estimated K-oc values. Hydrophobic
   sorption appears to dominate for dibenzofuran, benzothiophene and
   dibenzothiophene, whereas benzofuran and in particular quinoline
   sorption is influenced by inorganic sorption sites. This corresponds
   reasonably well with expectations based on estimates of critical organic
   carbon content. The sorption of quinoline at the uppermost sample was
   slightly higher (10\%-20\%) than for the deeper locations. This is
   possibly related to a slightly higher clay content at this depth. The
   sorption of dibenzofuran was higher at the deepest location
   (approximately 65\%) than for the above locations. The only measured
   geological parameter which was significantly different in the sample
   from the deep location was the content of fine silt. (C) 1999 Elsevier

   ratios (s:1) of clayey till (solid) to aqueous phase (liquid). The
   effect of the complex mixture of solutes on sorption of the four
   heterocyclic compounds: benzofuran, dibenzofuran, benzothiophene, and
   dibenzothiophene is evaluated by comparison with their sorption measured
   in single-solute systems. Sorption of the four compounds is affected by
   the complex mixture, with sorption decreases for all four compounds at
   high s:1 ratio indicating competitive sorption. The effect on sorption
   of the individual compounds is not related to solubility or
   hydrophobicity of the compounds. Freundlich-type isotherms are observed
   for all compounds in the high s:1-ratio experiments, but for the most
   hydrophobic compounds isotherms are close to linear. The sorption of
   N-compounds and benzofuran is apparently influenced by cation exchange
   and dipole-dipole attraction to clay minerals. At high concentrations a
   dramatic increase in the sorption of the most strongly sorbing compounds
   is observed in the low s:1-ratio experiment. The dramatic increase in
   sorption appears to be a result of multimolecular layer sorption or
   condensation on surfaces in the clayey till at high surface density of
   organic compounds, and the data are fitted by BET (Brunauer, Emmet, and
   Teller) type 2 isotherms. The increase may or may not be induced by the
   presence of N-heterocyclic compounds sorbed by cation exchange and
   dipole-dipole attraction. The desorption of the compounds was studied
   for the low s:1 ratio where multimolecular layer formation apparently
   had occurred. Partially irreversible sorption, hysteric Langmuir type
   desorption with isotherms of very high K-1 coefficient, or behaviour
   reflecting dissolution of a condensed phase is observed. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The diffusion of coal-tar compounds in natural clayey till was studied
   experimentally. Cores were exposed to a solution with near constant
   concentration of coal-tar compounds in a multi-component mixture for 5
   months, the cores were subsequently sub-sampled and analyzed, Diffusion
   profile data strongly indicates highly non-linear sorption isotherms.
   For dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, 2-methylquinoline, carbazole,
   phenanthrene, and fluorene, the profiles indicated significantly
   stronger sorption at high solute concentrations than at low solute
   concentrations, and than expected based on linear sorption isotherms.
   This corresponds with observed dramatic increase in sorption of these
   compounds at high surface density. For benzofuran, benzothiophene,
   quinoline, phenols, naphthalenes, and BTEXs the profiles indicated
   significantly weaker sorption at high solute concentrations than at low
   solute concentrations and than expected based on linear or Freundlich
   isotherms. The observed diffusion profiles have important implications
   with respect to transport of dissolved coal-tar compounds in
   multi-component mixtures of high concentrations as expected near
   immiscible phase coal-tar sources. Breakthrough times and concentration
   levels are affected significantly. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A volume of sand containing coal tar creosote was emplaced below the
   water table at CFB Borden to investigate natural attenuation processes
   for complex biodegradable mixtures. Coal tar creosote is a mixture of
   more than 200 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds
   and phenolic compounds. A representative group of seven compounds was
   selected for detailed study: phenol, m-xylene, naphthalene,
   phenanthrene, 1-methylnaphthalene, dibenzofuran and carbazole. Movement
   of groundwater through the source led to the development of a dissolved
   organic plume, which was studied over a 4-year period. Qualitative plume
   observations and mass balance calculations indicated two key
   conclusions: (1) compounds from the same source can display distinctly
   different patterns of plume development and (2) mass transformation was
   a major influence on plume behaviour for all observed compounds. (C)

Abstract = {{A source of coal tar creosote was emplaced below the water table at CFB
   Borden to investigate natural attenuation processes for complex
   biodegradable mixtures. A mass balance indicated that ongoing
   transformation occurred for seven study compounds. Phenol migrated as a
   discrete slug plume and almost completely disappeared after 2 years,
   after being completely leached from the source early in the study. The
   m-xylene plume migrated outward to a maximum distance at approximately 2
   years, and then receded back towards the source as the rate of mass flux
   out of the source decreased to below the overall rate of plume
   transformation. Carbazole showed similar behaviour, although the
   reversal in plume development occurred more slowly. The dibenzofuran
   plume remained relatively constant in extent and mass over the last 2
   years of monitoring, despite constant source input over this period,
   providing evidence that the dibenzofuran plume was at steady state.
   Meanwhile, the naphthalene and 1-methylnaphthalene plumes continued to
   advance and increase in mass over the observation period, although at a
   decreasing rate. The phenanthrene plume was also subject to
   transformation, although measurement of the rate was less conclusive due
   to the higher proportion of sorbed mass for this compound. Three lines
   of evidence are presented to evaluate whether the observed plume mass
   loss was due to microbial biodegradation. Measurement of redox-sensitive
   parameters in the vicinity of the plume showed the types of changes that
   would be expected to occur due to plume biodegradation: dissolved oxygen
   and SO42- decreased in groundwater within the plume while significant
   increases were noted for Fe2+, Mn2+ and methane. Further evidence that
   plume mass loss was microbially-mediated was provided by the
   accumulation of aromatic acids within the plume. Measurements of
   phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in aquifer material indicated that
   microbial biomass and turnover rate were greater within the plume than
   outside: also consistent with biodegradation. Study results highlight
   the potential for utilizing natural attenuation as a site cleanup
   approach for dissolved phase plumes from complex organic mixture like
   coal tar creosote. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The transport in macroporous clayey till of bromide and 25 organic
   compounds typical of creosote was studied using a large intact soil
   column. The organic compounds represented the following groups:
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenolic compounds,
   monoaromatic hydrocarbons (BTEXs), and heterocyclic compounds containing
   oxygen, nitrogen or sulphur in the aromatic ring structure
   (NSO-compounds), The clayey till column (0.5 m in height and 0.5 m in
   diameter) was obtained from a depth of 1-1.5 m at an experimental site
   located on the island of Funen, Denmark. Sodium azide was added to the
   influent water of the column to prevent biodegradation of the studied
   organic compounds. For the first 24 days of the experiment, the flow
   rate was 219 ml day(-1) corresponding to an infiltration rate of 0.0011
   m day(-1). At this flow rate, the effluent concentrations of bromide and
   the organic compounds increased very slowly. The transport of bromide
   and the organic compounds were successfully increased by increasing the
   flow rate to 1353 mi day(-1) corresponding to 0.0069 m day(-1). The
   experiment showed that the transport of low-molecular-weight organic
   compounds was not retarded relative to bromide. The
   high-molecular-weight organic compounds were retarded significantly, The
   influence of sorption on the transport of the organic compounds through
   the column was evaluated based on the observed breakthrough curves. The
   observed order in the column experiment was, with increasing
   retardation, the following: benzene = pyrrole = toluene = o-xylene =
   p-xylene = ethylbenzene = phenol = benzothiophene = benzofuran <
   naphthalene < 1-methylpyrrole < 1-methylnaphthalene = indole = o-cresol
   = quinoline < 3,5-dimethylphenol = 2,4-dimethylphenol < acridine <
   carbazole < 2-methylquinoline < fluorene < dibenzofuran < phenanthrene =
   dibenzothiophene. This order could not be predicted from regularly
   characteristics as octanol/water-distribution coefficients of the
   organic compounds but only from experimentally determined data. The
   results indicate that a thin clayey till cover of the type described in
   this paper does not protect groundwater against contamination by
   low-molecular-weight organic compounds. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted using a large, intact column of fractured
   clayey till to study the transport and biodegradation of 25 organic
   compounds typical of creosote. The column (0.5 m in height and 0.5 m in
   diameter) was collected from a depth of 2.5-3 m at an experimental site
   on the island of Funen, Denmark. For the first 82 days of the
   experiment, the column was infiltrated with water containing nitrate,
   but no organic compounds. During this period, significant nitrate
   removal and nitrite production were observed indicating that
   denitrification occurred in the clayey till. After 82 days, a mixture of
   25 organic compounds with a total concentration of approximately 70 mg
   1(-1) was added to the influent water together with a conservative
   tracer (92 mg bromide 1(-1)). Most of the organic compounds were
   transported as rapidly as bromide, and only carbazole, dibenzofuran,
   fluorene, dibenzothiophene, and phenanthrene were significantly
   retarded. No extensive loss of organic compounds was observed during
   this period, which was attributed to the high concentration of
   applicated organic compounds. After 40 days, the influent concentration
   of organic compounds was lowered by a factor of 5; subsequently,
   significant biodegradation of phenol, ethylbenzene, toluene, quinoline,
   indole, p-xylene, and o-cresol was observed. Additionally, o-xylene,
   naphthalene, l-methylnaphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene,
   2-methylquinoline, carbazole, acridine, benzothiophene,
   dibenzothiophene, benzofuran, dibenzofuran, pyrrole, 1-methylpyrrole,
   and benzene were biodegraded to some degree when oxygen was added
   concomitantly with nitrate (92 days after the addition of organic
   compounds). Pyrrole, 1-methylpyrrole, and benzene were only slightly
   biodegraded. The biodegradation of benzene was likely inhibited by the
   presence of pyrrole and/or 1-methylpyrrole. The study has shown that the
   transport of low-molecular-weight organic compounds through fractured
   clayey till may occur as rapid as the transport of bromide.
   Consequently, there is a high risk of groundwater contamination if
   aquifers are overlain with fractured clayey till with properties similar
   to the till used in this column study. The study has also shown that the
   till provides an environment when biodegradation of some organic
   compounds may occur when oxygen is provided. However, the concentration
   of oxygen present in water will often not be sufficient for complete
   biodegradation of the organic compounds at the concentrations known to
   be typical for creosote sites. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Year = {{1999}},

Abstract = {{The transport behavior of lithium, uranin, bromide and chloride was
   studied in column experiments using sediment from an unconfined aquifer
   at the Krauthausen test site. Sorption isotherms of uranin, bromide and
   chloride were determined in batch experiments. In addition, a
   sorption/desorption isotherm of uranin was determined. Inverse parameter
   estimation and asymptotic analysis of solute transport processes were
   used to interpret measured BTCs. The log transformed BTCs of bromide and
   chloride showed a linear decrease of the tailing part with time.
   Depending on the shape of the tail in the BTCs, a CDE with retardation
   or a mobile/immobile model was adjusted successfully. Measured uranin
   BTCs were described using either the CDE with hysteretic Freundlich
   sorption or the CDE with linear kinetic sorption. In addition, one of
   the measured uranin BTCs provided evidence for the presence of nonlinear
   nonequilibrium sorption. The discrimination and identification of the
   different types of sorption processes was based to a large extent on
   asymptotic analysis. However, in a few experiments asymptotic analysis
   did not provide information on the sorption process because the tailing
   concentrations fell below the detection limit before convergence to one
   of the asymptotic solutions could be observed. For none of these cases,
   the models analyzed in this work were able to describe the complete BTCs
   (including the tail). For two BTCs showing sorption hysteresis, the
   observed concentrations could be predicted using data from independent
   measurements almost without parameter fitting. Only a slight
   modification of the distribution coefficient was needed in one case.
   Lithium transport could be described either by Freundlich sorption or
   linear kinetic sorption. Field BTCs of uranin showed a qualitatively
   similar behavior as the BTCs observed in column experiments. Evaluation
   of the slope of log-log transformed field BTCs suggested that uranin
   sorption may be described by a nonlinear nonequilibrium sorption or
   hysteretic Freundlich sorption model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{From 1942 to the early 1980s, Rocky Mountain Arsenal (RMA), a superfund
   site northeast of Denver in central Colorado, served as a facility for
   the development, manufacture, and disposal of toxic organic and
   inorganic chemicals including US Army surety agents (including nerve gas
   and blistering agents), munitions, propellants, and pesticides. Arsenic
   (As) in the form of Lewisite (blistering agent), arsenic trioxide
   (herbicide), trisodium arsenate, and arsenic trichloride (process
   intermediate) was present in extremely large quantities at RMA's South
   Plants Processing Area. Even though current cleanup efforts are likely
   to remove the vast majority of As presently polluting the soil and
   groundwater, there is still a future potential threat for the movement
   of residual levels of As into groundwater supplies. The distribution and
   movement of As were monitored over a 2.5-year period to evaluate the
   threat to groundwater by low levels of As. Because of access
   restrictions to RMA, an off-site meso-scale (0.6 m diameter by 1.83 m in
   height) weighing lysimeter study was conducted using excavated soil
   (i.e., Ascalon sandy Flay loam) associated with As contamination at
   RMA's South Plants Processing Area. The long-term study revealed the
   persistence of As under aerobic soil conditions, and a limited, but
   perceptible, mobility of As (0.87\% of the total applied As drained
   beyond 1.5 m) resulting from interacting physical, chemical, and
   biological factors. Results suggest that even though the movement of As
   is significantly retarded due to adsorptive processes, preferential flow
   and chemical factors (i.e., pH and redox potential) can mobilize As at
   point locations above permissible levels, if precautionary measures are
   not taken. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Geochemical processes in mining waste rock, including sulphide
   weathering, heavy metal release (Cu and Zn), and acidity consumption by
   carbonate and silicate mineral weathering have been investigated. We
   operated six large columns, each containing about 1.6 tons of waste
   rock, with unsaturated water flow for nearly 3 1/2 years. The column
   results illustrate two pH controls: (1) sulphide oxidation with calcite
   dissolution sustaining a neutral pH, and, (2) simultaneous sulphide
   oxidation and weathering of primary silicate minerals at pH 3-4. The
   column effluents either remained at near neutral pH or became acidic
   after a lag period of between 0.5 and 3 years. For columns developing
   acidic effluents, there was an associated mobilisation of copper with
   maximum copper concentrations as high as 500 ppm. The variable calcite
   content of the rock appears to be an important factor for controlling
   the effluent pH within the columns. Extrapolating these results to the
   field scale, suggests that the much slower than expected copper release
   at the site is due to fractions of waste rock with very low sulphide
   content, fractions with significant amounts of calcite remaining, and
   slower weathering rates due to lower temperature, larger particle size
   and lower oxygen content. In addition, immobile water in the waste rock
   is expected to accumulate weathering products rather than release them
   with the site drainage. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Observations of organic contaminant liquids retained in layered soil
   profiles indicate contaminant saturations much greater than residual,
   where residual saturation would be expected, if one assumes a static
   distribution of fluid pressure. It is theorized that the increased
   retention of fluid is caused by coarse soil layers that reach a very
   small unsaturated hydraulic conductivity early in the drainage process,
   and thus prevent further drainage. The results from a retention
   experiment in a one-dimensional column were used to test this
   hypothesis. A vertical column was dry packed with a layer of fine sand
   (high entry pressure head) overlaying a layer of coarse sand (low entry
   pressure head). The column was saturated with an organic liquid and then
   drained. The saturation and pressure profiles were monitored over an
   extended period of time. A dual-gamma system was used to determine the
   liquid saturation, and specially fitted ring tensiometers were used to
   measure the capillary pressure at selected points along the column. The
   pressure readings and saturation profiles showed a high retention of oil
   in the fine layer above the interface of the two soils. The profiles
   were compared first with static pressure and corresponding saturation
   profiles, and secondly with profiles calculated assuming a very small
   steady flow through the column. The experimental profiles closely
   resemble those profiles that assume small flow rates, and display a much
   higher retention above coarse layers than the static profiles. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{An analytical modeling analysis was used to assess when local
   equilibrium (LE) and nonequilibrium (NE) modeling approaches may be
   appropriate for describing nonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL) pool
   dissolution. NE mass-transfer between NAPL pools and groundwater is
   expected to affect the dissolution flux under conditions corresponding
   to values of Sh'St (the modified Sherwood number (L-x k(l)/D-z)
   multiplied by the Stanton number (k(l)/v(x))) < approximate to 400. A
   small Sh'St can be brought about by one or more of: a large average pore
   water velocity (v(x)), a large transverse dispersivity (alpha(z)), a
   small pool length (L-x), or a small mass-transfer coefficient (k(l)). On
   the other hand, at Sh'St > approximate to 400, the NE and LE solutions
   converge, and the LE assumption is appropriate. Based on typical
   groundwater conditions, many cases of interest are expected to fall in
   this range. The parameter with the greatest impact on Sh'St is k(l). The

   by comparing pool dissolution fluxes from the literature to each other
   and to the corresponding LE and NE model predictions. The LE model
   described most of the pool dissolution flux data reasonably well, given
   the uncertainty in some of the model parameter estimates, suggesting
   that the LE model can be a useful tool for describing steady-state NAPL
   pool dissolution under some conditions. However, a conclusive test of
   the LE assumption was difficult due to the Limited range of experimental
   conditions covered and the uncertainties in some of the model input
   parameters, including the mass-transfer coefficient correlation required
   for the NE model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Gasoline behaviour in the unsaturated zone is difficult to predict as a
   number of soil factors, gasoline properties and environmental conditions
   will determine the eventual fate of a spill. These factors include the
   diffusive and convective processes that contribute to passive
   volatilization. To gain a better insight into passive volatilization and
   how it can impact the clean-up of a contaminated site, batch column
   experiments were completed. Three soils were tested at varying initial
   gasoline contents, water contents, and at room and sub-zero
   temperatures. The results indicate that immiscible phase movement to the
   surface is a significant contributor to passive volatilization. However,
   the immiscible phase movement ceases once the gasoline content has
   dropped below a threshold level. The driving force necessary for
   immiscible phase movement is maintained by gasoline precipitation at the
   soil surface. Higher soil water contents inhibited the volatilization of
   gasoline as water impacted both the diffusive and wicking movement of
   the gasoline. Sub-zero temperatures reduced volatilization and extended
   the time to cessation of wicking behaviour. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Organic bases in crude oil have been linked to complex interfacial
   phenomena that could affect the multiphase flow of these fluids in
   subsurface systems. Little information is available, however, to
   correlate the strength and concentration of organic bases in nonaqueous
   phase liquids (NAPLs) to interfacial properties. The specific objectives
   of this paper were: (1) to evaluate and apply titration techniques
   employing nonaqueous solvents to quantify the acid neutralizing capacity
   and characterize the strength of the organic base constituents in
   complex NAPL mixtures; and, (2) to relate these characteristics to the
   wetting properties of quartz minerals exposed to environmentally
   significant NAPLs. The selection of a suitable organic solvent is
   critical for nonaqueous titration. Mixtures of known organic bases were
   used to verify the capability of three different solvent systems for
   quantifying the concentration and strength of organic bases. Methyl
   iso-butyl ketone was identified as the best solvent for the nonaqueous
   titration-providing both accurate measurement of the total concentration
   of bases as well as providing a means of differentiating between strong
   and weak base constituents. The NAPLs tested showed a wide range of base
   concentrations and were found to contain only weak organic bases. All of
   the NAPLs with a base number greater than two significantly altered the
   system wettability at pH = 4.6. Only a few, however affected the
   wettability at pH = 7.2. These observations confirm the characterization
   of the organic bases as weak bases. The titration techniques, however,
   cannot characterize the strength of the bases precisely enough to
   predict the aqueous phase pH at which a NAPL-water-quartz system would
   become oil wetting. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments demonstrate that in situ recovery of pooled
   tetrachloroethene (PCE) from porous media may be accomplished more
   efficiently using multiple-step alcohol floods than with single alcohol
   floods. To optimize flooding efficiency while maintaining a low risk of
   downward DNAPL mobilization, a three-step flooding process is developed
   employing an isobutanol preflood, a composite alcohol mainflood, and a
   polymer solution postflood, The density and viscosity of these solutions
   are manipulated to prevent the onset and propagation of viscous and
   gravitational fingers, while maintaining phase behavior critical for
   efficient miscible NAPL displacement, An aqueous partitioning preflood
   solution of 10\% by volume (10\% v) isobutanol reduces the NAPL density
   in situ to approximately 1.00 g/ml by swelling the NAPL prior to
   miscible displacement induced by the mainflood, The composite alcohol
   mainflood, containing 65\% v ethylene glycol and 35\% v I-propanol
   maintains miscibility while achieving neutral buoyancy and near stable
   displacement of the NAPL. Aqueous solutions of xanthan gum polymer
   efficiently displace the mainflood, reducing viscous fingering
   associated with waterfloods. Two-dimensional experiments using the
   multiple-step technique achieve 99.8\% DNAPL mass recovery using a total
   of 0.45 pore volumes of alcohol, illustrating greater recovery
   efficiency than previous alcohol flooding formulations under comparable
   conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of pore-water velocity (v), transport distance (L), and
   hydraulic residence time (L/v(m), in which subscript m refers to mobile
   region) on the fraction of mobile water (beta), mass transfer rate
   (alpha), and longitudinal dispersivity (lambda) were evaluated from 53
   breakthrough curves of a conservative tracer (rhodamine WT), observed
   from tracer experiments conducted at a field site. The individual
   effects of hydraulic conductivity (K) and hydraulic gradient (I), which
   determine v, were also evaluated. A three-dimensional non-equilibrium
   analytical model, N3DADE, was used to analyze the data, combined with a
   modified method of moments for estimation of pore-water velocity. At v
   values of 5-104 m/day in an alluvial gravel aquifer, the following
   significant tendencies were found: (1) beta and alpha increased while
   lambda decreased with increasing v and K; (2) alpha decreased while
   lambda increased with increasing L and L/v(m); (3) there was no
   significant relationship between beta and alpha and between beta and
   lambda, bur alpha had a strong inverse correlation with lambda. The
   results of this study suggest that both aquifer properties (K) and fluid
   dynamics (I and L/v(m)), as well as transport scale (L), were
   controlling factors in physical non-equilibrium transport and parameter
   interrelationships. beta was largely a property of the aquifer medium,
   while alpha and lambda appeared to be properties of both aquifer medium
   and fluid. There was significant `immobile water' in the alluvial gravel
   aquifer system, probably resulting from aquifer heterogeneity, in which
   slow mixing between zones of contrasting permeability was important. (C)

Abstract = {{A variety of column experiments have been completed for the purpose of
   selecting and evaluating suitable surfactants for remediation of
   nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). The various NAPLs tested in the
   laboratory experiments were tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene
   (TCE), jet fuel (JP4) and a dense nonaqueous phase Liquid from a sire at
   Hill Air Force Base, UT. Both Ottawa sand and Hill field soil were used
   in these experiments, Surfactant candidates were first screened using
   phase behavior experiments and only the best ones were selected for the
   subsequent column experiments. Surfactants which showed high contaminant
   solubilization, fast coalescence times, and the absence of liquid
   crystal phases and gels during the phase behavior experiments were
   tested in soil column experiments. The primary objective of the soil
   column experiments was to identify surfactants that recovered at least
   99\% of the contaminant. The secondary objective was to identify
   surfactants that show low adsorption and little or no loss of hydraulic
   conductivity during the column experiments. Results demonstrated that up
   to 99.9\% of the contaminants were removed as a result of surfactant
   flooding of the soil columns. The addition of xanthan gum polymer to the
   surfactant solution was shown to increase remediation efficiency as a
   lower volume of surfactant was required for recovering a given volume of
   NAPL. Based on these experimental results, guidelines for designing
   highly efficient and robust surfactant floods have been developed and
   applied to a field demonstration. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The Kidd Creek Cu-Zn sulfide mine is located near Timmins, Ontario, Mill
   tailings are thickened and deposited as a slurry in a circular
   impoundment with an area of approximately 1200 ha. Deposition of
   tailings as a thickened slurry from a central discharge ramp results in
   a conical-shaped tailings deposit with low perimeter dykes, a uniform
   grain-size distribution, uniform and low hydraulic conductivity, and a
   tension-saturated zone above the water table up to 5 to 6 m thick, These
   characteristics provide benefits over conventionally disposed tailings
   with respect to tailings management. The thick tension-saturated zone
   within the railings limits the thickness of unsaturated tailings that
   are susceptible to rapid sulfide oxidation. The conical shape of the
   deposit results in the formation of a recharge area near the centre of
   the impoundment and discharge in the peripheral areas. In contrast, the
   elevated nature of many conventional, unthickened tailings impoundments
   results in recharge over most of the surface of the impoundment, with
   discharge occurring outside the impoundment through large containment
   dykes. Three-dimensional pore water flow modelling suggests that
   approximately 90\%, of the total discharge from the thickened railings
   occurs within the tailings impoundment. When discharge is confined
   within the impoundment, there is improved control over low-quality
   effluent, and an opportunity to design passive control measures to
   reduce treatment costs and minimize environmental impacts. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The US Department of Energy (DOE) has been evaluating the unsaturated
   zone (UZ) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as a potential repository site for
   high level nuclear waste. A large number of boreholes have been drilled
   at the site, and an underground tunnel, the exploratory studies facility
   (ESF), has been constructed. A variety of boreholes and underground
   tests have been conducted that have provided large amounts of data from
   the UZ. This paper summarizes some of the current knowledge of
   geological and hydrological characteristics of the site and provides the
   framework for a series of technical papers that follow in this issue. A
   brief discussion is also given to the repository safety strategy for
   Yucca Mountain and the UZ site-scale flow model. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An important issue in the evaluation of the unsaturated zone (UZ) at
   Yucca Mountain, Nevada is the calibration of the parameters used in the
   3-D site-scale numerical flow model. The hydrogeologic parameters are
   calibrated using an inversion code (ITOUGH2) to fit measured core sample
   and in situ data according to statistical criteria. The available data
   include saturations, water potentials, pneumatic pressure records, and
   pore water age estimates based on geochemical analyses. Five 1-D columns
   are extracted from the 3-D site-scale model and used in an inversion
   that matches data from the five boreholes simultaneously. This results
   in layer-averaged fracture and matrix permeabilities and van Genuchten
   fitting parameters. The columns are then refined and individual
   inversions are performed with each I-D model to develop a spatially
   varying parameter set. A number of sensitivity studies are performed to
   evaluate the effects of modeling assumptions on the calibrated
   parameters. Several fracture-matrix interaction formulations are also
   investigated during the study. The results show that the calibrated
   parameter set concluded to be most consistent with the conceptual model
   provides a good fit to the ambient data. The study also shows that the
   choice of the fracture-matrix interaction formulation has a significant
   effect on the calibrated parameter set. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Yucca Mountain, Nevada is being investigated as the proposed site for
   geologic disposal of the United States' high level nuclear waste. A
   massive effort to collect data for characterization of the
   thermo-hydrologic behavior of the unsaturated zone is being conducted at
   the site. Several boreholes have been instrumented by the United States
   Geological Survey and the Nye County Nuclear Waste Repository Project
   Office for passive pneumatic monitoring of the subsurface. One-, two-
   and three-dimensional numerical models are used to simulate the observed
   subsurface pressure variations. The data are inverted using these models
   in order to characterize the unsaturated system and estimate the
   pneumatic diffusivity of important geologic features. Blind predictions
   of subsurface response and subsequent comparison to recorded data have
   built confidence in the models of Yucca Mountain. Inversions show that
   the pneumatic response of the system is dominated by the Paintbrush
   non-welded unit (PTn). Faults are shown to be fast pathways for gas flow
   but affect subsurface response only on a relatively local scale.
   Estimates of the diffusivity of the tuffs that comprise Yucca Mountain
   range from a low of 0.008 m(2)/s in the non-welded pre-Yucca bedded tuff
   layer to a high of 4 m(2)/s in the densely welded, fractured Topopah
   Spring tuff. Estimates of diffusivity in fault zones at Yucca Mountain
   range between 0.03 m(2)/s and 1500 m(2)/s with the highest being in the
   Drill Hole Wash fault where it intersects the Topopah Spring tuff. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigate the utility and appropriateness of various conceptual and
   numerical approaches for modeling several flow and transport processes
   in the unsaturated zone (UZ) at Yucca Mountain, NV, using a
   one-dimensional (I-D) column extracted from a three-dimensional (3-D) UZ
   site-scale model. Simulations of steady-state and transient moisture
   flow, transient gas now, tracer transport, and thermal loading scenarios
   are performed, using a variety of numerical approaches to treat
   fracture-matrix (F-M) interactions, including an effective continuum
   model (ECM) and several varieties of dual-continua models. For the
   dual-continua models, we investigate the effect of varying the number of
   matrix,gridblocks per fracture gridblock, the formulation applied for
   calculating F-M interface area, and whether or not global
   matrix-to-matrix flow occurs (dual-permeability vs. dual-porosity
   models). The key findings of the work based on a 1-D column are as
   follows. For steady-state moisture flow, most of the numerical and
   conceptual models provide similar results for saturation and fracture
   flow profiles. The ECM adequately models the steady-state processes
   because the system is not too far away from F-M equilibrium. For both
   transient moisture flaw and transient transport in a steady flow field,
   the ECM is not adequate in general. Within the dual-continua models, the
   formulation for F-M interface area can have a major effect on the
   hydrodynamic response to an infiltration pulse and tracer arrival at
   various horizons, with fracture responses becoming earlier as F-M
   interface area decreases. The number of matrix blocks also has a
   significant effect on response time, with the more accurate
   multi-matrix-gridblock models yielding slower fracture response times.
   For transient gas flow arising from barometric pressure variations, the
   ECM adequately models the process, because F-M gas flow occurs rapidly
   compared to the time scale of the barometric pressure variations. For
   thermal loading, preliminary studies indicate that the ECM does not
   capture all the significant physical processes, because rapid fluid and
   heat flow can occur in the fractures before the matrix has a chance to
   equilibrate. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3-D) simulations of the spatial and temporal
   variations in chloride and strontium concentrations in porewaters were
   performed to constrain infiltration rates, flow paths, and mixing
   processes in the unsaturated zone (UZ) at Yucca Mountain, NV. Chloride
   concentrations in infiltrating water were calculated from aerial
   distributions of precipitation and infiltration rates for the current
   climatic conditions and for the last glacial maximum, combined with
   effective chloride concentrations in precipitation. Modeled
   concentrations are roughly similar to measured porewater chloride
   concentrations from the Paintbrush nonwelded tuffs in the Exploratory
   Studies Facility (ESF) tunnel and in boreholes suggesting that the mean
   infiltration rate over the site is unlikely to be higher than the
   calculated mean infiltration rate for the modern climate (similar to 5
   mm/year; {[}Flint, A.L., Hevesi, J.A., Flint, L.E., 1996. Conceptual and
   Numerical Model of Infiltration for the Yucca Mountain Area, Nevada.
   Milestone 3GU1623M. U.S. Geol. Surv. Water Res. Invest. Rep. U.S.
   Geological Survey, Denver, CO]). Porewaters from the late Pleistocene (>
   10 ka) could be present in the Paintbrush bedded tuffs and in the
   underlying Topopah Spring welded tuffs (TSw), predominately under
   regions of thick alluvium having little infiltration. However,
   porewaters at the potential repository level may have a higher
   proportion of Holocene recharge due to the higher calculated
   infiltration rate in this region. Dual-permeability simulations shaw
   that in low infiltration regions chemical disequilibrium can exist
   between fracture and matrix porewaters, as a result of the climate
   change 10,000 years ago. Below the potential repository level,
   simulations show significant mixing due to lateral flow on top of the
   low permeability basal vitrophyre in the Topopah Spring unit and on
   zeolitized tuffs in the Calico Hills unit. Perched water chloride
   concentrations are closely matched using the calculated conditions for
   the last glacial maximum climate, with some component of Holocene
   recharge. Measured strontium concentrations in the UZ and in the perched
   water bodies can be roughly matched by assuming conservative behavior in
   nonzeolitic units and strong ion exchange in zeolitic units, and
   indicate that the perched water bodies are poorly mixed. Differences in
   the Cl contents of samples having a bomb-pulse Cl-36 signature and those
   with a modem ratio indicate that waters of intermediate Cl-36/Cl ratios
   may be mixtures, that without other isotopic data could be inferred as
   either Pleistocene or Holocene age waters. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the use of a multiphase
   subsurface flow model to study perched water phenomena in vadose zones.
   Modeling studies are based on field investigations of the unsaturated
   zone (UZ) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Perched water data have been
   compiled, analyzed, and incorporated into a three-dimensional (3-D) UZ
   flow model developed to investigate perched water phenomena at Yucca
   Mountain. A conceptual model of perched water occurrences is discussed,
   and a series of comprehensive computer modeling studies on perched water
   at the site are presented. The model has been calibrated using perched
   water data observed in six boreholes, and reproduces water-perching
   conditions in the unsaturated zone of the mountain. Both steady-state
   and transient simulations have been conducted. The steady-state
   simulation results are in agreement with the observed perched water
   data, including water saturation and potential profiles and perched
   water elevations. Transient numerical pumping tests were performed using
   pumping testing data collected in the field from two boreholes. The
   numerical pumping test results match observed water levels collected
   during pumping and recovery periods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional unsaturated-zone numerical model has been developed
   to simulate flow and distribution of moisture, gas and heat at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada, a potential repository site for high-level radioactive
   waste. The model takes into account the simultaneous flow dynamics of
   liquid water, vapor, air and heat in the highly heterogeneous, fractured
   porous rock in the unsaturated zone (UZ). This model is intended for use
   in the prediction of the current and future conditions in the UZ so as
   to aid in the assessment of the system performance of the proposed
   repository. The modeling approach is based on a mathematical formulation
   of coupled multiphase, multicomponent fluid and heat flow through porous
   and fractured rock. Fracture and matrix flow is treated using both
   dual-permeability and effective-continuum modeling approaches. The model
   domain covers a total area of approximately 43 km(2), and uses the land
   surface and the water table as its top and bottom boundaries. In
   addition, site-specific data, representative surface infiltration, and
   geothermal conditions are incorporated into the model. The reliability
   and accuracy of the model have been the subject of a comprehensive model
   calibration study, in which the model was calibrated against measured
   data, including liquid saturation, water potential and temperature. It
   has been found that the model is generally able to reproduce the overall
   system behavior at Yucca Mountain with respect to moisture profiles,
   pneumatic pressure variations in different geological units, and ambient
   geothermal conditions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A systematic modeling study of the effect of thermal loading on
   moisture, gas, and heat flow in the unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain
   has been carried out. The study is based on a two-dimensional (2-D)
   north-south vertical cross-section, using both the effective continuum
   and the dual-permeability modeling approaches. A study was also
   conducted on a three-dimensional (3-D) model using the effective
   continuum approach. The 2-D model conducted in 1996 uses a average
   uniform infiltration rate of 4.4 mm/year and a thermal load of 83
   kW/acre. The 3-D model uses an spatially varying infiltration rate and a
   revised average thermal load of 87.6 kW/acre. For the rock properties
   used in the Topopah Springs (TSw) hydrogeological unit, heat pipe
   conditions develop above and below the repositary in 10-100 years in
   both models. The average temperature of the boiling zone is about 96
   degrees C. This boiling zone is confined to the TSw hydrogeological unit
   and lasts about 1000 years. At the top of the CHn (vitric/zeolitic
   interface), predicted maximum temperature is about 70-75 degrees C after
   about 2000 years. The model predicts a temperature increase of
   approximately 30 degrees C at the water table. The results show that
   thermal loading at the repository also results in significant changes in
   the moisture distributions at the repository horizon and the zone
   directly above and below it. A large increase in liquid and gas flux,
   several orders of magnitude above ambient conditions, is predicted near
   the repository. This study indicates the ECM and dual-k modeling
   approaches provide similar simulation results, in terms of temperature
   and moisture flow and distribution. The only difference is that at early
   times, the ECM model predicts more extensive boiling conditions.
   Localized dry-out is predicted in areas with low infiltration flux
   within the central part of the repository. However, because coarse grids
   were used, average saturation in the matrix blocks representing the
   repository indicates will remain high even when the regions near
   repository are completely dry. Analysis of the flux pattern at the top
   and bottom boundaries of the repository shows that the liquid always
   flows into the repository for most the thermal loading period (up to
   10,000 years). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to predict the effect of changes in
   future climatic conditions on the distribution and movement of moisture
   in the unsaturated zone (UZ) at Yucca Mountain. Modeling is conducted as
   part of a continuing effort (Wittwer et al., 1995; Bodvarsson and
   Bandurraga, 1996; Bodvarsson et al., 1997) using TOUGH2, a multiphase,
   integrated finite difference numerical model (Pruess, 1991) calibrated
   using available saturation, water potential and pneumatic data from six
   boreholes (Bodvarsson et al., 1997). Modeling results indicate that
   wetter future climatic conditions may increase lateral diversion above
   low permeability units of the Calico Hills nonwelded (CHn) hydrogeologic
   unit, and decrease lateral diversion above the Paintbrush nonwelded
   (PTn) hydrogeologic unit. The existence of lateral diversion above the
   CHn hydrogeologic unit is important if this diversion allow moisture to
   bypass altered zeolitic layers where radionuclides potentially released
   from the repository could be sorbed. Lateral diversion within the PTn
   hydrogeologic unit is important because it could redistribute the
   spatial distribution of net infiltration above the repository horizon.
   Nevertheless, no field evidence of lateral diversion in the PTn unit has
   been observed, suggesting that faulting or interface heterogeneities
   limit lateral flow. Collection and analysis of additional,geochemical
   data may decrease uncertainty in capability of the PTn and altered CHn
   hydrogeologic units to create barriers to vertical flow, improving
   confidence in future climatic predictions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that water seepage in thick unsaturated zones
   in fractured rocks may occur in non-volume-averaged fashion, as
   relatively `slow' flow in the rock matrix, and `fast' flow along
   localized preferential pathways in fractures. This poses difficult
   challenges for mathematical modeling. We summarize recent field
   observations of subsurface flow and transport from semi-arid regions,
   discuss alternative approaches for modeling fast preferential flow, and
   evaluate prospects for resolving current uncertainties. It is concluded
   that modeling of flow in fractured unsaturated zones is complex, but
   feasible, while modeling of transport processes is more difficult and
   less certain. We emphasize that successful modeling requires clear and
   specific objectives, but does not necessarily require a complete and
   detailed understanding of all processes and properties of a system. In
   order to achieve a robust modeling capability, as needed for engineering
   assessment and design of waste containment systems, it is suggested that
   two or more alternative modeling approaches be developed simultaneously
   for a given site. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on field test results and model analyses of the first
   set of five niche seepage tests conducted in the Exploratory Studies
   Facility at Yucca Mountain. The test results suggest that (1) a niche
   opening (short drift excavated for this study) acts as a capillary
   barrier; (2) a seepage threshold exists; and (3) the seepage is a
   fraction of the liquid released above the ceiling. Before seepage
   quantification, air injection and liquid release tests at two niche
   locations were conducted to characterize the fracture flow paths. Nearly
   two-order-af-magnitude changes in air permeability values were measured
   before and after niche excavation. The dyed liquid flow paths, together
   with a localized wet feature potentially associated with an ambient flow
   path, were mapped during dry excavation operations. After niche
   excavation, the seepage is quantified by the ratio of the water mass
   dripped into a niche to the mass released above the opening at selected
   borehole intervals. For the first set of five tests conducted at Niche
   3650 site, the ratios range from 0\% (no dripping for two tests) to
   27.2\%. Changes in flow path distributions and water accumulation near
   seepage threshold were observed on the niche ceiling. The seepage test
   results compare reasonably well with model results without parameter
   adjustments, using capillary barrier boundary condition in the niche and
   two-dimensional and three-dimensional conceptualizations to represent
   discrete fracture and fracture network for the flow paths. Model
   analyses of the niche tests indicate that the seepage is very sensitive
   to the niche boundary condition and is moderately sensitive to the
   heterogeneity of the fracture flow paths and to the strengths of matrix
   imbibition. Strong capillary strength and large storage capacity of the
   fracture flow paths limit the seepage. High permeability value also
   enhances diversion and reduces seepage for low liquid release rate. (C)

Abstract = {{An important issue for the long-term performance of underground nuclear
   waste repositories is the rate of water seepage into the waste
   emplacement drifts. A prediction of the seepage rate is particularly
   complicated for the potential repository site at Yucca Mountain, NV,
   which is located in a thick sequence of unsaturated, fractured tuffs.
   Underground openings in unsaturated media might act as capillary
   barriers, diverting water around them. In the present work, we study the
   potential rates of seepage into drifts as a function of predicted
   percolation flux at Yucca Mountain, based on a stochastic model of the
   fractured rock mass in the drift vicinity. A variety of now scenarios
   are considered, assuming estimated present-day and predicted future
   climate conditions. We show that the heterogeneity in the flow domain is
   a key factor controlling seepage rates, since it causes channelized flow
   and local pending in the unsaturated flow field. The rates of seepage
   are related in a complex non-linear manner to the rock properties, the
   size and shape of the drift, the degree of heterogeneity, and the
   assumed percolation scenario. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Single Heater Test (SHT) is one of two in-situ thermal tests
   included in the site characterization program for the potential
   underground nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. Coupled
   thermal-hydrological-mechanical-chemical processes in the fractured rock
   mass around the heater were monitored by numerous sensors emplaced among
   30 boreholes. Periodic active testing of cross-hole radar tomography,
   neutron logging, electrical resistivity tomography, and interference air
   permeability tests probed the change of moisture content in the rock
   mass. Thermal-hydrological processes in the SHT have been simulated
   using a 3-D numerical model and compared to the monitored data. The good
   agreement between the temperature data and simulated results indicates
   that the thermal-hydrological responses of the SHT in the 9 months of
   heating are well-represented by the coupled thermal-hydrological
   numerical model. The dominant heat transfer process is by conduction and
   the signature of vapor and liquid counter flow is subtle in the
   temperature data. The simulated result of a dry-out zone of about 1 m
   (at the end of the heating phase) around the heater hole, and a
   condensation zone of increased liquid saturation outside of the dry-out
   zone, is consistent with the radar tomography and air permeability data.
   Tomography data and post-test laboratory measurements indicate that the
   moisture content is larger below than above the heater horizon,
   suggesting gravity drainage of condensate in the fractures. Model
   studies show that gravity drainage occurs in simulations using the dual
   permeability conceptual model, but is absent in the effective-continuum
   model, where matrix and fractures are required to be in thermodynamic
   equilibrium at all times. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. Ail rights

Abstract = {{A concept is proposed to assess in situ petroleum hydrocarbon
   mineralization by combining data on oxidant consumption, production of
   reduced species, CH4, alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   with measurements of stable isotope ratios, The concept was applied to a
   diesel fuel contaminated aquifer in Menziken, Switzerland, which was
   treated by engineered in situ bioremediation. In the contaminated
   aquifer, added oxidants (O-2 and NO3-) were consumed, elevated
   concentrations of Fe(II), Mn(II), CH4, alkalinity and DIC were detected
   and the DIC was generally depleted in C-13 compared to the background.
   The DIC production was larger than expected based on the consumption of
   dissolved oxidants and the production of reduced species. Stable carbon
   isotope balances revealed that the DIC production in the aquifer
   originated mainly from microbial petroleum hydrocarbon mineralization,
   and that geochemical reactions such as carbonate dissolution produced
   little DIC. This suggests that petroleum ydrocarbon mineralization can
   be underestimated if it is determined based on concentrations of
   dissolved oxidants and reduced species. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Theoretical analysis of the multicomponent soil vapor extraction (SVE)
   process is presented. It is based on general principles of transport in
   porous medium and the Raoult's law describing the equilibrium between
   multicomponent nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) and aqueous/gaseous
   phases. The principal simplifying assumptions of the theory include:
   isothermal conditions, homogeneous porous medium, radial advective
   transport of volatile organic compounds, steady-state radial soil gas
   flow through the contaminated zone, stagnant NAPL and aqueous phases,
   constant solid-water distribution and gas-water partitioning
   coefficients. The main emphasis of the study is on the description of
   propagating composition fronts under local equilibrium conditions.
   Construction of multicomponent front solutions is carried out by
   applying the concept of coherent waves, developed by Helfferich and
   Klein for multicomponent chromatography. It is shown that under typical
   conditions component volatilities control the sequence of propagating
   fronts. However, this sequence may change for very small NAPL saturation
   values (similar to 10(-3)-10(-4) or less) and/or relatively high
   retardation factors (>10(2)). Tailing effect of nonequilibrium
   (kinetically controlled) gas-water partitioning behind the NAPL zone is
   also addressed in the presented study. This effect is shown to diminish
   with the increase of NAPL saturation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Interest in coupled biodegradation and transport of organic contaminants
   has expanded greatly in the past several years. In a system in which
   biodegradation is coupled with solute transport, the magnitude and rate
   of biodegradation is influenced not only by properties of the microbial
   population and the substrate, but also by hydrodynamic properties (e.g.,
   residence time, dispersivity), By nondimensionalizing the
   coupled-process equations for transport and nonlinear biodegradation, we
   show that transport behavior is controlled by three characteristic
   parameters: the effective maximum specific growth rate, the relative
   half-saturation constant, and the relative substrate-utilization
   coefficient. The impact on biodegradation and transport of these
   parameters, which constitute various combinations of factors reflecting
   the influences of biotic and hydraulic properties of the system, are
   examined numerically. A type-curve diagram based on the three
   characteristic parameters is constructed to illustrate the conditions
   under which steady and non-steady transport is observed, and the
   conditions for which the linear, first-order approximation is valid for
   representing biodegradation. The influence of constraints to microbial
   growth and substrate utilization on contaminant transport is also
   briefly discussed. Additionally, the impact of biodegradation, with and
   without biomass growth, on spatial solute distribution and moments is
   examined. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Innovative in situ remediation technologies using injection/extraction
   well pairs which recirculate partially treated groundwater as a method
   of increasing overall treatment efficiency have recently been
   demonstrated, An important parameter in determining overall treatment
   efficiency is the fraction of flow that recycles between injection and
   extraction points. Numerical and semi-analytical methods are currently
   available to determine this parameter and an analytical solution has
   been presented for a single injection/extraction well pair. In this
   work, the analytical solution for fraction of recycled flow for a single
   injection/extraction well pair is extended to multiple co-linear well
   pairs. In addition, a semi-analytical method is presented which permits
   direct calculation of fraction recycle for a system of arbitrarily
   placed injection/extraction wells pumping at different rates. The
   solution is used to investigate the behavior of multiple well pairs,
   looking at how well placement and pumping rates impact capture zone
   width and fraction recirculation (and, therefore, overall treatment
   efficiency). Results of the two-well solution are compared with data
   obtained at a recent field-scale demonstration of in situ aerobic
   cometabolic bioremediation, where a pair of dual-screened
   injection/extraction wells was evaluated. A numerical model is then used
   to evaluate the impact of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy on the
   overall treatment efficiency of the dual-screened injection/extraction
   well pair. The method presented here provides a fast and accurate
   technique for determining the efficacy of injection/extraction systems,
   and represents a tool that can be useful when designing such in situ

Abstract = {{The prognosis for the remediation of contaminated fractured media is
   much worse than that for more homogeneous units. Fractures act as
   conduits for the flow of dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), while
   diffusion is responsible for the storage of dissolved mass in the
   surrounding matrix. A numerical model incorporating aqueous phase
   transport in a variable-aperture fracture and its surrounding matrix is
   developed and coupled with an existing two-phase flow model. The
   processes of transient two-phase flow, non-equilibrium dissolution,
   advective-dispersive transport in the fracture, and three-dimensional
   matrix diffusion are included in the model. Results from various
   investigations show that the DNAPL distribution is very sensitive to
   variations in aperture within a single fracture. Diffusion-controlled
   mass removal from both the matrix and from the hydraulically
   inaccessible zones within the fracture itself result in extremely large
   time frames for significant mass removal from these systems. Success in
   aqueous phase mass removal from the matrix is very sensitive to the
   effective fracture spacing. The hydraulic gradient in the fracture only
   affects the amount of water removed from the system, and does not
   greatly affect the amount of time required to remove the contaminant
   mass from the matrix. The ability to remove mass is somewhat sensitive
   to the porosity and effective matrix diffusion coefficient over the
   range of expected values. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The oxidative treatment of chlorinated ethylenes in ground water using
   permanganate was investigated in a series of batch kinetic tests, Five
   chlorinated ethylenes including tetrachloroethylene (PCE),
   trichloroethylene (TCE), and three isomers of dichloroethylenes (DCEs)
   were examined. The degradation process was rapid with pseudo-first-order
   rate constants ranging from 4.5 X 10(-5) to 0.03 s(-1) at MnO4- = 1 mM.
   The rate increased with a decreasing number of chlorine substituents on
   the ethylene, The higher reactivity of trans-DCE (k(obs) = 30 X 10(-3)
   s(-1) at MnO4- = 1 mM) as compared to cis-DCE (k(obs) = 0.9 X 10(-3)
   s(-1) at MnO4- = 1 mM) is thought to be caused by a significant steric
   effect due to the formation of a large cyclic activated complex, TCE
   oxidation as a second-order reaction was confirmed and the rate
   constant, k = 0.67 +/- 0.03 M-1 s(-1), is independent of pH over the
   range of 4-8. The activity of both Cl- and hydrogen ions was monitored
   over time and suggests essentially complete dechlorination, making the
   degradation products less harmful than the parent compounds. Competition
   far MnO4- from other organic compounds in ground water or highly
   contaminated ground water was also evaluated in experiments. A simple
   and quick approach was demonstrated to estimate permanganate consumption
   by other organic compounds for field applications and to predict the TCE
   degradation rate in a system involving multiple contaminants. The
   modeling results suggest that the effect of autocatalysis by MnO2 on TCE
   degradation is significant when the system contains high concentration
   levels of MnO4- and TOC. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Mass transfer between aquifer material and groundwater is often modeled
   as first-order rate-limited sorption or diffusive exchange between
   mobile zones and immobile zones with idealized geometries, Recent
   improvements in experimental techniques and advances in our
   understanding of pore-scale heterogeneity demonstrate that two (or even
   a few) rate coefficients are insufficient in many cases. Here, we
   investigate a piece-wise linear model for a continuous distribution of
   rate coefficients, that has several advantages over previously used
   `statistical' distribution models (with functional form from gamma or
   lognormal PDF's): (1) distributions of arbitrary, even bimodal, shapes
   can be represented; (2) linear estimation methods can be applied to
   determine the distribution from experimental data; (3) the uncertainty
   in the distribution can be determined for each of its sections; and (4)
   the relationship between the time scales of available data and those of
   estimatable mass transfer processes can be investigated. A statistical
   model refinement algorithm is presented that reduces the number of
   parameters (sections of the piece-wise linear model) to the admissible
   minimum. We show that purging experiments allow estimation of a wider
   zone of the rate distribution than do batch experiments, and hence will
   provide predictions that are accurate over a wider range of time scales.
   Finally, in an application to TCE gas-purging desorption data, the
   piece-wise linear rate-distribution model has a higher probability of
   being adequate than these using a gamma or lognormal distribution or a
   single rare coefficient. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a formulation for water flow and solute transport in
   two-dimensional variably saturated media that accounts for the effects
   of the solute on water density and viscosity. The governing equations
   are cast in a dimensionless form that depends on six dimensionless
   groups of parameters. These equations are discretized in space using the
   Galerkin finite element formulation and integrated in time using the
   backward Euler scheme with mass lumping. The modified Picard method is
   used to linearize the water flow equation. The resulting numerical
   model, the MARUN model, is verified by comparison to published numerical
   results. It is then used to investigate beach hydraulics at seawater
   concentration (about 30 g l(-1)) in the context of nutrients delivery
   for bioremediation of oil spills on beaches. Numerical simulations that
   we conducted in a rectangular section of a hypothetical beach revealed
   that buoyancy in the unsaturated zone is significant in soils that are
   fine textured, with low anisotropy ratio, and/or exhibiting low physical
   dispersion. In such situations, application of dissolved nutrients to a
   contaminated beach in a freshwater solution is superior to their
   application in a seawater solution. Concentration-engendered viscosity
   effects were negligible with respect to concentration-engendered density
   effects for the cases that we considered. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The results of a screening model are always approximate, lying within an
   imprecision range. This paper focuses first on various types of
   imprecision in such modelling results, introduced either by subjective
   or state-of-the-art estimates of coefficients or through measurement
   error, and second on the different types of methods able to take into
   account imprecision in the input parameters in order to evaluate
   imprecision in the simulation results. Emphasis is placed on the
   evaluation of imprecision in potential groundwater contamination by
   pesticides using the Attenuation Factor (AF) index, the Retardation
   Factor (RF) index and two different methods of uncertainty analysis: the
   classical first-order uncertainty analysis and a method based on the
   fuzzy set approach as an illustration of the basic ideas. The results of
   this comparison show that the fuzzy set approach is more suitable for
   evaluating imprecision in screening models than the classical technique.
   Furthermore, it furnishes a mean value imprecision range and adds a
   degree of confidence to this range. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Uncultivated riparian areas can play an important role in reducing
   nutrient loading to streams in agricultural watersheds. Groundwater flow
   and geochemistry were monitored in the riparian zone of a small
   agricultural watershed in southern Ontario. Hydraulic and geochemical
   measurements were taken along a transect of monitoring wells extending
   across the riparian area into an agricultural field. Chloride and
   nitrate concentrations in groundwater samples collected from the
   agricultural field were much higher than in samples from the riparian
   area. A sharp decline in both nitrate and chloride concentrations was
   observed near the field-riparian zone boundary. It appears that
   increased recharge within the riparian zone, as compared to the
   artificially drained field, caused nitrate-rich groundwater from the
   field to be diverted downward beneath the riparian zone, thus limiting
   the input of agrochemicals to the riparian area and consequently
   protecting the stream from potential contamination. Geochemical data
   also indicated that nitrate was attenuated in the downward moving
   groundwater. Patterns of dissolved oxygen concentrations and redox
   potential in the subsurface coincided with the pattern defined by
   groundwater nitrate. These patterns indicated that conditions within the
   riparian zone and at depth near the field-riparian zone boundary were
   conducive to denitrification. A Linear relation between the delta(15)N
   and delta(18)O values of nitrate from the monitored transect also
   supported denitrification as the primary nitrate removal mechanism. This
   study provides a new conceptual model of how riparian zones may prevent
   nitrate contamination of streams, and highlights the need for a complete
   understanding of both groundwater flow and geochemistry in riparian
   environments. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of aerobic m-xylene biodegradation kinetics was performed on
   the results of laboratory batch microcosms. A modified version of the
   computer model BIO3D was used to determine the Monod kinetic parameters,
   k(max) (maximum utilization rate) and K-S (half-utilization constant),
   as well as the Haldane inhibition concentration, K-I, for pristine
   Borden aquifer material, The proposed method allows for substrate
   degradation under microbial growth conditions. The problem of
   non-uniqueness of the calculated parameters was overcome by using
   several different initial substrate concentrations. With a
   relative-least-squares technique, unique kinetic degradation parameters
   were obtained. Calculation of the microbial yield, Y, based on microbial
   counts from the beginning and the end of the experiments was crucial for
   reducing the number of unknowns in the system and therefore for the
   accurate determination of the kinetic degradation parameters, The
   kinetic parameters obtained in the present study were found to agree
   well with values reported in the literature. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We investigated patterns of contaminant transport within the layered and
   fractured aquifer of a 7.3-km(2) upland agricultural watershed in
   east-central Pennsylvania, USA. Geometry and hydraulic properties of the
   aquifer had been characterized by field testing and model calibration.
   These results were extended to simulate flow pathways and patterns of
   contaminant transport in both areal and cross-section formats within the
   watershed. The analyses indicated that the ground water flow system at
   the larger watershed scale is comprised of smaller units of subsurface
   flow which are self-contained at the scale of first- or second-order
   streams. For this scale subwatershed or larger, contaminant inputs to
   ground water from the mix of land use within the subwatershed should
   translate directly to the quality of nonstorm streamflow. For
   illustration, recharge water quality from typical land-use distributions
   were combined with a simple model of contaminant transport to simulate
   nitrate concentration patterns in ground water in a cross-section
   format. Land use in the vicinity of the drainage divides between streams
   was found to control ground water quality within the deeper layers of
   the aquifer, while land use over the remainder of the watershed area
   affected water quality only within the shallower layers of the aquifer.
   Streamflow nitrate data collected during a baseflow survey on the
   watershed were examined in context of these simulations and found to
   support the conclusions. Results of the study demonstrate the potential
   for localized contamination of ground water and nonstorm streamflow by
   agricultural land use, as well as the potential for managing stream
   quality and minimizing contamination within targeted zones of the ground
   water by controlling land use position. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Experiments coupled with mathematical modeling are used to further
   elucidate the quantification of NAPL pool dissolution and its
   enhancement by water flushing. The experiments were performed using
   glass bead-packed column reactors with small pools of neat toluene or a
   toluene in dodecane mixture (toluene mole fraction, X-tol approximate to
   0.02 or 0.09). Experimental quasi-steady-state toluene dissolution
   fluxes were determined by a mass-balance approach. The results of these
   experiments are used to quantify the impact of flushing on the NAPL pool
   dissolution flux, J, for wide ranges of two of the key controlling
   parameters-equilibrium concentration, C-S, and average pore water
   velocity, nu(x). In addition, the experimental dissolution flux data are
   used to evaluate predictions made using independently obtained model
   parameters and analytical mathematical models incorporating the two
   basic approaches used for mathematically describing the interphase
   distribution of NAPLs: the local equilibrium (LE) approach; and the mass
   transfer limited, or nonequilibrium (NE) approach. The data from the
   experiments with a neat toluene pool demonstrate the expected trend of
   increasing J as nu(x), increased from approximately 2 to 30 m/day. The
   LE model and the NE model with an average mass transfer coefficient,
   k(1) = 4.76 m/day, were able to describe the neat toluene pool data for
   nu(x) < 18 m/day reasonably well. However, for nu(x) > 18 m/day, the NE
   model with k(1) = 4.76 m/day provides a better description of the data,
   suggesting that the equilibrium boundary condition may become invalid
   for very high velocities. The experiments with the binary toluene in
   dodecane pools also show the expected trend of increasing J with
   increasing nu(x). The LE model describes the binary pool data reasonably
   well for the entire range of nu(x) studied (approximately 0.1 to 10
   m/day), and the NE model predictions with the average k(1) = 4.76 m/day
   determined in the neat-pool studies do not deviate significantly from
   the LE model in this nu(x) range, although small deviations occur for >
   10 m/day. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments in an undisturbed, saturated column of weathered and
   fractured shale saprolite using fluorescent carboxylate-coated latex
   microspheres as tracers indicate that particle diameter plays a major
   role in controlling transport. In this study the optimum microsphere
   diameter for transport was approximately 0.5 mu m. Microspheres larger
   than the optimum size were present in the effluent at lower relative
   concentrations, apparently because of greater retention due to
   gravitational settling and/or physical straining. The smaller than
   optimum microspheres also experienced greater retention, apparently
   related to their higher rates of diffusion. Faster diffusion can lead to
   more frequent collisions with, and attachment to, fracture walls and may
   also lead to movement of particles into zones of relatively immobile
   pore water in the fractures or in the fine pore structure of the
   clay-rich matrix between fractures. Dismantling of the soil column and
   mapping of the distribution of retained microspheres indicated that
   there was substantial size-segregation of the microspheres between
   different fractures or in `channels' within a fracture. Examination of
   small core samples showed that the smallest microspheres (0.05-0.1 mu m)
   were present in the fine pores of the matrix at distances of up to 3-4
   mm from the nearest fracture, which supports the hypothesis that small
   particles can be retained by diffusion into the matrix. Calculations of
   settling velocity and diffusion rate using simple 1D approaches suggest
   that these processes could both cause significant retention of the
   larger and smaller particles, respectively, even for the fast advective
   transport rates (up to 32 m/day) observed during the experiments. (C)

Abstract = {{An intermediate-scale flow cell experiment was conducted to study the
   flow of liquid and the transport of dissolved trichloroethylene (TCE) in
   a saturated, heterogeneous porous medium system. The 1.67-m long by
   1.0-m high by 0.05-m wide flow cell was packed with three layers and
   five lenses consisting of four different sands. All lenses and layers
   had horizontal interfaces, except the lowest interface, which was
   pointed down in the middle. Groundwater flow was imposed by manipulating
   the water levels in two head chambers. Over 500 mi of dyed TCE was
   allowed to infiltrate at a constant rate into the porous medium from a
   narrow source located on the surface. A dual-energy gamma radiation
   system was used to determine TCE saturations at 1059 locations. Fluid
   samples were collected from 20 sampling ports to determine dissolved TCE
   concentrations. The TCE migrated downwards in the form of several
   relatively narrow (3-8 mm) fingers. Visual observations and measured TCE
   saturations indicated that the spilled TCE accumulated on top of, but
   did not penetrate into, fine-grained sand lenses and layers but that
   some TCE infiltrated into medium-grained sand lenses. This behavior is a
   result of the different nonwetting-fluid entry and permeability values
   of the sands. Most of the TCE finally pooled on top of a fine-grained
   sand layer located in the bottom part of the flow cell. A multifluid
   code (STOMP: subsurface transport over multiple phases), accounting for
   TCE entrapment, was used to simulate the movement of liquid TCE. Using
   independently obtained hydraulic parameter values, the code was able to
   qualitatively predict the observed behavior at the interfaces of the
   lenses and sand layers. Simulation results suggest that most of the
   liquid TCE at the lowest interface was in free, continuous form, while
   most of the other TCE remaining in the flow cell was entrapped and
   discontinuous. A simple pool dissolution model was used to predict
   observed dissolved TCE concentrations. Results show that the measured
   concentrations could only be predicted with unrealistically high
   transverse dispersivity values. The observed TCE concentrations are a
   result of a combination of entrapped and pool dissolution. (C) 1999

Abstract = {{An intermediate-scale flow cell experiment was conducted to remove a
   liquid trichloroethylene (TCE) spill from a saturated, heterogeneous
   porous medium using pump-and-treat (P\&T) as well as surfactant flushing
   (SF) techniques. Dissolved TCE concentrations were measured at 20
   locations, while fluid saturations were obtained with a dual-energy
   gamma scanner. The behavior of the TCE spill has been described by
   Oostrom et al. (1998b) {[}Oostrom, M., Hofstee, C., Walker, R.C., Dane,
   J.H., 1998b. Movement and remediation of TCE in a saturated
   heterogeneous porous medium: I. Spill behavior and initial dissolution,
   this issue.]. A total of six alternating P\&T and SF periods were used
   to remediate the flow cell. A two-well system, consisting of an
   injection and an extraction well, was used during the first five
   remediation periods. For the last SF period, a three-well system was
   employed with two injection wells and one extraction well. During the
   first P\&T period, most entrapped TCE was removed, but TCE saturations
   in a substantial pool on top of a fine-grained sand layer were largely
   unaffected. During the first SF period, a dense plume was formed
   containing solubilized TCE which partially sank into the fine-grained
   sand. In addition, unstable fingers developed below the liquid TCE in
   the pool. In several samples, small TCE droplets were found, indicating
   mobilization of TCE. Most of the samples with concentrations larger than
   5000 ppm had a milky, emulsion-like appearance. The SF considerably
   reduced the amount of TCE in the pool on top of the fine-grained sand.
   During the second P\&T period, plume sinking and instabilities were not
   observed. After starting the second SF period, some unstable fingering
   and plume sinking resumed, starting at the upstream end of the TCE in
   the pool. The saturation distribution obtained after the second SF
   period was quite similar to the one obtained after the first SF period,
   indicating that additional removal of TCE through SF was difficult as a
   result of the limited accessibility of the TCE in the pool. A gamma
   scan, obtained after three weeks of pumping using the three-well
   configuration, shows that all the liquid TCE had been removed from the
   coarse-grained sand. Computations based on extraction rates and measured
   TCE concentrations show that only about 60\% of the injected TCE was
   removed from the cell during the experiment. Part of the missing 40\%
   might have moved downwards into the fine-grained sand as a result of
   pure phase mobilization. The experimental results suggest that besides
   the positive effects of solubilization, possible detrimental processes
   such as pure phase mobilization and dense aqueous-phase plume behavior
   should be considered during SF. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{For the performance assessment study of a geological disposal of High
   Level Waste (HLW) in clayey formations, migration studies are essential.
   For low permeability soils (clays), classical diffusion studies take a
   very long time. In order to reduce the experimental time, we propose an
   electrical field as driving force to accelerate the migration of ionic
   species. This paper reports the assessment of the electromigration
   technique as a powerful new and fast technique for migration studies.
   The apparent molecular diffusion coefficient can be derived by two
   independent methods using the migration parameters obtained from an
   electromigration experiment, namely the apparent dispersion coefficient
   and the apparent convection velocity. First, it can be calculated from
   the velocity of the migrating species by the Einstein relation. But,
   corrections are necessary for electroosmotic flow. The apparent
   electroosmotic mobility is experimentally determined as 2.2 . 10(-9)
   m(2)/Vs. Second, it can be calculated from the relation between the
   apparent dispersion coefficient and the total apparent convection
   velocity. But it is necessary to know the dispersion length of the
   medium. The dispersion length for Boom Clay is experimentally determined
   as 8 . 10(-5) m. Because of the serious reduction in time, it becomes
   possible to run series of experiments at different electrical fields to
   obtain averaged values for the apparent molecular diffusion coefficient
   according to the two methods. Experiments at different electrical fields
   have another advantage: the intercept of the linear relationship between
   the total apparent convection velocity and the apparent dispersion
   coefficient gives the apparent molecular diffusion coefficient. The
   apparent molecular diffusion coefficients obtained for Sr-85, I-131 and
   HTO are respectively 0.8 . 10(-11), 15 . 10(-11), and 24 . 10(-11)
   m(2)/s. These values are confirmed by pure diffusion experiments. The
   excellent agreement with the apparent molecular diffusion coefficients
   obtained by classical diffusion tests clearly demonstrates the
   feasibility of the electromigration technique for the determination of
   diffusion coefficients. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effect of synthetic wastewater containing
   surfactants on the sorption of atrazine using an equilibrium batch
   technique. Laboratory experiments were conducted on three soils with two
   non-ionic (Rexol and Rexonic) surfactants and one anionic (Sulphonic)
   surfactant, specifically manufactured for the detergent industry. Four
   sets of experiments were conducted to examine the influence of
   surfactants on the equilibrium time of atrazine sorption, to explore the
   effect of surfactant concentration, pH and type of surfactant on the
   amount of atrazine sorbed and to determine sorption isotherms of
   atrazine in the presence of surfactants. The results indicate that the
   application of Sulphonic results in dramatic increase in the adsorption
   of atrazine on to soils, the increase being directly proportional to the
   concentration of the surfactant. Application of the Sulphonic
   surfactants with a concentration of 3000 mg/l can result in a
   significant increase in K-d values of atrazine for loam and sandy loam
   soils. On the other hand, the effect of non-ionic surfactants depends on
   their concentration, Generally, non-ionic surfactants can result in a
   slight increase in atrazine sorption at high concentration, an exception
   being Rexol on sandy loam soil. At low concentrations, non-ionic
   surfactants have shown a tendency to decrease atrazine sorption. (C)

Abstract = {{Data from long-term groundwater sampling, limited coring, and associated
   studies are synthesised to assess the variability and intrinsic
   remediation/natural attenuation of a dissolved hydrocarbon plume in
   sulphate-rich anaerobic groundwater. Fine vertical scale (0.25- and
   0.5-m depth intervals) and horizontal plume-scale (> 400 m)
   characteristics of the plume were mapped over a 5-year period from 1991
   to 1996. The plume of dissolved BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
   xylene) and other organic compounds originated from leakage of gasoline
   from a subsurface fuel storage tank. The plume was up to 420 m long,
   less than 50 m wide and 3 m thick. In the first few years of monitoring,
   BTEX concentrations near the point of leakage were in approximate
   equilibrium with non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) gasoline. NAPL
   composition of core material and long-term trends in ratios of BTEX
   concentrations in groundwater indicated significant depletion (water
   washing: volatilisation and possibly biodegradation) of benzene from
   residual NAPL after 1992. Large fluctuations in BTEX concentrations in
   individual boreholes were shown to be largely attributable to seasonal
   groundwater flow variations. A combination of temporal and spatial
   groundwater quality data was required to adequately assess the
   stationarity of plumes, so as to allow inference of intrinsic
   remediation. Contoured concentration data for the period 1991 to 1996
   indicated that plumes of toluene and o-xylene were, at best, only
   partially steady state (pseudo-steady state) due to seasonal groundwater
   flow changes. From this analysis, it was inferred that significant
   remediation by natural biodegradation was occurring for BTEX component
   plumes such as toluene and o-xylene, but provided no conclusive evidence
   of benzene biodegradation. Issues associated with field quantification
   of intrinsic remediation from groundwater sampling are highlighted,
   preferential intrinsic biodegradation of selected organic compounds
   within the BTEX plume was shown to be occurring, in parallel with
   sulphate reduction and bicarbonate production. Ratios of average
   hydrocarbon concentrations to benzene for the period 1991 to 1992 were
   used to estimate degradation rates (half-lives) at various distances
   along the plume. The estimates varied with distance, the narrowest range
   being, for toluene, 110 to 260 days. These estimates were comparable to
   rates determined previously from an in situ tracer test and from
   plume-scale modelling. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Soils surrounding industrial sites or at locales where industrial
   chemicals are utilized, frequently become contaminated through
   unsuitable discharge of potentially hazardous organic compounds. The
   fate and transport of these chemicals must be sufficiently understood to
   predict detrimental environmental impacts and to develop technically and
   economically appropriate remedial action to minimize environmental
   degradation. Improving our understanding of the processes involved in
   organic pollutant vapor transport is important because the gas phase is
   often the most mobile, and therefore most potentially hazardous phase.
   In order to gain a better understanding of the basic kinetic processes
   affecting soil adsorption/desorption of volatile organic compounds
   (VOC's) in the vapor phase, we conducted VOC adsorption/desorption
   experiments using oven-dry clay minerals. Transient, isothermal,
   gravimetric sorption experiments using volatile organic compounds
   (VOC's) acetone, benzene and toluene onto pure clay minerals obtained
   from Ward's Scientific (kaolinite, illite, and Ca-montmorillonite)
   suggest a biphasic sorption mechanism on these minerals. Experimental
   results indicate that hydrophobic sorption onto oven-dry clay minerals
   with negligible soil organic matter is controlled by rates of
   inter-particle Fickian diffusion mechanisms, intra-particle Fickian
   diffusion mechanisms, and sorption kinetics. Using an analytical
   solution to Fick's Second Law where sorption is partitioned into
   macroscopic and microscopic domains, each with unique diffusion time
   constants, enables precise prediction of experimental sorption
   observations. Correlation coefficients of 0.999 were found between the
   parameter optimized analytical solution and very large sets of
   experimental data. Macroscopic diffusion coefficients ranged from 10(-2)
   to 10(-4) cm(2)/min, while microscopic diffusion coefficients ranged
   from 10(-12) to 10(-17) cm(2)/min. Sorption rates suggest that
   significant fractions of VOC's adsorb onto surfaces other than the
   external mineral surfaces. The fraction of mass sorbed on the mineral
   surface ranged from 30\% to 75\% of the equilibrium sorbed mass.
   Equilibrium sorption mass correlates approximately to mineral specific
   surface area and, similarly, the fraction of `irreversible' sorption
   appears to be proportional to the specific surface area of the clay
   mineral. Finally, the experimental results suggest that sorption
   processes (once the sorbate has diffused to the sorbent) are not
   instantaneous. Due to the experimental inter-particle length scales and
   intra-particle diffusion processes, diffusional time constants
   associated with each process during sorption experiments were generally
   found to he within two orders of magnitude. Such close agreement would
   not be expected if particles larger than a few micrometers (i.e.,
   aggregates) comprised part of the sorbing soil system. Although the
   experiments were conducted using oven-dry clays, it is hoped that these
   results offer an improved conceptual model of clay mineral sorption
   processes to better explain field observations of VOC persistence in the
   subsurface. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The results of dissolution experiments for benzene, toluene, m-xylene
   and naphthalene (BTXN) from a relatively insoluble oil phase
   (tridecane), residually trapped in a non-sorbing porous medium, are
   described. This mixture was chosen to simulate dissolution of soluble
   aromatic compounds from a petroleum hydrocarbon mixture, e.g., crude
   oil, for which a large fraction of the mixture is relatively insoluble.
   The experiments were carried out at a small source length to
   interstitial velocity ratio, L/Lv, so that dissolution would be mass
   transfer limited (MTL). When fitted to data for toluene, a multiregion
   mass transfer model was found to predict the experimental data
   satisfactorily for the other components without adjustment of the mass
   transfer rate parameters. These results indicate that the dissolution
   process can be generalized for various hydrophobic organic compounds
   present in a multicomponent non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) when mass
   transfer limitations are present. This also suggests that dissolution
   data obtained for one compound can be useful for predicting the
   dissolution histories for other compounds from petroleum hydrocarbon
   mixtures. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A computer program to calculate coupled mass transport and fluid rock
   interactions has been developed. CHEMFRONTS is based on the
   quasi-stationary state approximation and it uses a kinetic expression to
   describe mineral dissolution and precipitation rates. It simulates the
   chemical evolution of the mineral and aqueous phases over time along a
   streamline. For fast kinetics, local equilibrium conditions are
   approached. In the aqueous phase, complexation and redox reactions are
   included. Reactions with gas phases such as carbonation may also be
   handled by the program in some special cases. The quasi-stationary state
   approximation makes it possible to solve problems that would require an
   extremely large computer effort with conventional models. Such problems
   arise when the mass of minerals is large compared to the concentrations
   in the water. The program is especially suited to handle sharp reaction
   fronts. As the program does not use spatial discretization, the
   separation between closely located fronts can be resolved and the
   movements of the fronts may be computed with high spatial resolution.
   Sharp fronts are usual in the ground and typical examples an redox
   fronts and dissolution and precipitation fronts. The capabilities of the
   program are shown in the interpretation of two field-scale processes.

Abstract = {{Column and batch experiments were conducted with sandstone and ground
   water samples to investigate oxidation of uraninite precipitated by
   microbially mediated reduction of U(VI), a contaminant in ground water
   beneath a uranium mill tailings site near Tuba City, AZ, USA. Uraninite
   precipitated together with mackinawite (FeS0.9) because Fe(III) from the
   sandstone and sulfate, another contaminant in the water were reduced
   together with U(VI). After completion of U(VI) reduction, experiments
   were conducted to find out whether uraninite is protected by mackinawite
   against reoxidation. Uncontaminated ground water from the same site,
   containing 7 mg/l of dissolved oxygen, was passed through the columns or
   mixed with sandstone in batch experiments. The results showed that small
   masses of uraninite, 0.1 mu g/g of sandstone, are protected by
   mackinawite from reoxidation. Uraninite masses on the order of 0.1 mu
   g/g correspond to U(VI) concentrations of 0.5 mg/l, typically
   encountered in uranium contaminated mound waters. Mackinawite is an
   effective buffer and is formed in sufficient quantity to provide
   long-term protection of uraninite. Uranium concentrations in ground
   water passed through the columns are too low (4 mu g/l) to distinguish
   between dissolution and oxidative dissolution of uraninite. However,
   batch experiments showed that uraninite oxidation takes place, (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Source zone characterization of DNAPL in the subsurface is a necessary
   part of managing environmental risks. Modeling DNAPL-water displacement
   processes at the pore-scale can lead to greater insight and
   understanding of lateral spreading, the extent of vertical migration,
   and the final fluid distributions of dense non-aqueous phase liquids. A
   two-dimensional stochastic aggregation model is developed to study
   DNAPL-water displacement in porous media. The model is a modified
   diffusion limited aggregation model, and uses essential properties
   governing front stability as model input: DNAPL-water viscosity
   differences, DNAPL-water density differences, intrinsic permeability of
   the porous media, flow rate, and the inclination angle of the porous
   media from the horizontal. Due to the simplicity of the algorithm, this
   modeling technique can produce realistic DNAPL-water configurations much
   faster than conventional continuum approaches and allows for a Monte
   Carlo approach to be utilized. The model is validated through comparison
   to laboratory experiments involving 1,2-Dichloroethane, carbon
   tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, and mobile pyrogard 53. These
   experiments were performed at varying flow rates and angles of
   inclination from the horizontal. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper reports an index-based regional-scale characterization of
   non-paint source groundwater contamination potential for the
   agricultural areas on the Canary Island of Tenerife. The relative
   leaching potential for 24 pesticides was quantitatively assessed and
   ranked using the Leaching index (Li) for the soil, landcover, and
   recharge conditions in Tenerife. The uncertainty in the Li estimates,
   due to uncertainties in the soil, recharge, and chemical data, were
   accounted for using first-order uncertainty analysis. Several of the
   pesticides considered in this study were assessed to be potential
   leachers. The soil insecticide Carbofuran
   (il,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl-n-methylcarbamate) was found
   to have the greatest leaching potential for the soil, landcover, and
   recharge conditions across Tenerife. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of the K(f) and n parameters of the Freundlich
   sorption isotherm for atrazine and their correlation with soil textural
   variables, cation exchange capacity and organic carbon content were
   studied in a stagnic podzoluvisol. Ninety-three sample points were
   organized on an irregular three-dimensional grid to a depth of 3.2 m. A
   trend in the vertical direction explains, for most variables, about 85\%
   of the observed variance. This trend also significantly influences the
   observed correlation structure between the variables. The horizontal and
   vertical trends were removed from the data set with the median polish
   algorithm. The residuals resulting from this technique obey the
   intrinsic hypothesis. Organic carbon content, cation exchange capacity
   and n revealed spatial structure. The estimated correlation length
   scales in the vertical direction were between 0.63-0.81 m for n and the
   organic carbon content, and between 0.25-0.40 m for the cation exchange
   capacity. The variograms of sand, loam, clay and K(f) exhibited pure
   nugget. The correlation structures between the variables differ for
   different spatial increments. Variables appeared correlated at small
   spatial increments whereas they are not correlated if the spatial
   location of the sample points is neglected. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This study reports the impact of the degree of water saturation on
   sorption nonequilibrium parameters. Two nonionic organic compounds
   (benzene anti dimethylphthalate) and three nonaggregated sandy soils
   were utilized. Local equilibrium assumptions were found to be invalid
   for describing the transport of these compounds even at pore-water
   velocities as low as 0.7 cm/h. Sorption nonequilibrium appeared to be of
   a diffusive nature rather than due to a slow chemical reaction. Sorption
   mass-transfer coefficients varied proportionally with pore-water
   velocity. A strong correlation between the mass-transfer coefficient and
   residence time was found utilizing present and previously reported
   laboratory data. A similar relationship was also found for the
   mass-transfer coefficient between mobile and immobile water regions.
   Field data indicate that the sorption mass-transfer coefficient may
   continue to decrease in a consistent way even at residence times as
   large as 5 x 10(3) h. Variations in the degree of water saturation had
   no impact on the value of the sorption mass-transfer coefficient other
   than what would be expected due to changes in the residence time. This
   suggested that movement into the solid grains of the large emptied pores
   through diffusion from the water-filled pores into stagnant water
   covering these grains was relatively fast compared to the sorption rate.

Abstract = {{Porous media column experiments were used to investigate Pseudomonas
   fluorescens strain P17 transport as a function of water content and the
   influences of the solid-liquid and gas-liquid interfaces. Retention of
   radiolabeled P17 in washed quartz sand was evaluated at 100, 84, and
   46\% water saturation. At the completion of each experiment, the porous
   medium was extruded and sampled directly for cell retention on the basis
   of a radiolabel mass balance. Maximum cell retention occurred in the top
   centimeter of porous media at all three water contents and decreased
   with depth in the column. The total fraction of cells retained (R-t) was
   inversely proportional to water content, with nearly twice the cell
   retention at 46\% saturation (R-t - 0.95) compared to retention in 100\%
   water-saturated experiments (R-t = 0.50). Total retained cells were
   further divided into strongly and weakly attached fractions by settling
   a sample of the porous medium through groundwater to dislodge loosely
   adhering cells. Cells that became suspended in the solution represented
   the fraction retained at the gas-liquid interface or weakly attached to
   the solid-liquid interface (R-g). Those that remained attached to the
   porous medium were defined as cells strongly attached to the
   solid-liquid interface (R-s). Values of R-g/R-t were inversely related
   to water content, while R-s/R-t decreased with decreasing saturation.
   Bacteria thus preferentially accumulated at the gas-liquid interface
   with total cell removal inversely proportional to water content. The
   increased retention of bacteria at the gas-liquid interface indicates
   the presence of the interface is an important factor in limiting
   pathogen migration, evaluating biocolloid-facilitated transport of
   pollutants, and developing bioremediation strategies for unsaturated
   porous media. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Studies are presented investigating the ability to enhance aryl
   nitro-reduction processes in sediments through electron donor addition.
   In particular, high molecular weight (starch and guar gum) and/or low
   aqueous solubility electron donors (oleic acid) were studied, since they
   should be less prone to diffusive loss to the water column after
   addition to contaminated areas. For comparison, complimentary studies
   were conducted with water-soluble electron donors (acetate and
   dextrose). The ability to enhance activity was measured by methane
   production and reduction of either nitrobenzene or 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene
   to aniline or dinitroaniline. The results demonstrate that all electron
   donors resulted in increased methane production after a lag phase. The
   highest level of methane production and the shortest lag phase in
   uncontaminated sediment microcosms was observed in acetate-fed systems.
   Sorption studies of all electron donors showed that starch was
   partitioning the least into the water phase. In microcosms containing
   nitrobenzene, trinitrobenzene and acetate, methane production did not
   occur and nitro-reduction was not observed. Conversely, the addition of
   dextrose or starch yielded methane production and aryl nitro-reduction
   with each contaminant tested. Neither nitrobenzene nor trinitrobenzene
   was significantly reduced in HgCl(2)-killed controls. From these
   studies, it appears that starch may be well suited for applications of
   in-place, anaerobic sediment bioremediation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Soil vapor extraction (SVE) is a standard remediation technique for
   cleaning up soils contaminated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A
   key parameter for planning SVE operations is the time required to reach
   the desired cleanup standard. In this paper, an approximate analytical
   solution is developed, which allows the fast estimation of cleanup times
   in layered unsaturated zones. The contaminants are assumed to be
   dissolved in the pore water, sorbed on the soil matrix and mixed with
   the soil air. Liquid organic phase is absent. For partitioning between
   gas and water and water and solid, local-equilibrium is assumed The
   analytical solution is based on the well mixed reservoir model and on
   the plug flow model. It is shown that, for a number of scenario cases,
   the results of the analytical solution are, for practical purposes, in
   reasonable agreement with a numerical solution of the partial
   differential equations for the local-equilibrium advection-dispersion
   model of mass transport in porous media by Fickian diffusion and Darcian
   air flow. The results are displayed in terms of Peclet number of
   molecular diffusion (PNMD). In the analytical solution three different
   approximations are used. The PNMD range is divided into three intervals,
   representing different transport regimes. At low PNMD, molecular
   diffusion dominates transport in both layers. In this interval cleanup
   time is estimated by the average of the plug flow time for one pore
   volume through the layer of higher permeability, and the cleanup time
   estimated by the mixed reservoir model. At intermediate PNMD values,
   advective transport dominates in the more permeable layer and molecular
   diffusion in the less permeable. Consequently, cleanup time is limited
   by diffusive mass transfer from the less to the more permeable layer. In
   this interval, the estimation of cleanup time is entirely based on the
   mixed reservoir model. At high PNMD values, transport is governed in
   both layers by advection. Here, cleanup time is estimated by applying
   the plug flow model to the layer of lower permeability. The range of
   soil permeability values, for which such high PNMD values can be
   achieved, as well as the range of the actual air flow rates, are
   identified. The limitations of the validity of local-equilibrium
   assumption at high PNMD values are discussed using the relationship
   between desorption rates and gas advection fluxes. Further, the
   sensitivity of cleanup time estimates with respect to the independent
   dimensionless parameters characterizing the SVE configuration
   considered, is studied. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Double reservoir diffusion cell tests were employed to estimate
   parameters for fluoride sorption and diffusion through porous clay
   media. Tests were conducted on both commercial kaolin and bentonite
   clays. The bentonite was found to be a better fluoride barrier than
   kaolin, especially when volumetric changes from swelling were minimised
   by clamping. Modelled values of effective diffusion in kaolin were
   typically around 0.015 m(2)/yr, which are nearly three times lower than
   the molecular diffusion in free solution and 10 times greater than the
   value obtained for clamped bentonite (constant volume and constant
   confining pressure). Optimised sorption parameters obtained by fitting
   both linear and non-linear sorption models to diffusion cell
   breakthrough data were compared with equivalent parameters from batch
   sorption tests. Both models were equally capable of accurately fitting
   all experimental data. However, in cases of highly non-linear sorption,
   care must be taken with the linear model as the sorption parameter
   depends on the concentration range. Sorption parameters from fluoride
   batch tests and clay tortuosities from chloride diffusion tests were
   found to adequately predict fluoride diffusion results. It was found
   that the modelled parameters for diffusion and partition did not depend
   significantly on the initial moisture content at compaction of the clay
   plug. Clay plugs formed through consolidation of a slurry, however,
   appear to provide more tortuous barriers than compacted clay plugs. Some
   decline in fluoride retention was observed with increasing ionic
   strength of solution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Pages = {{185-206}},

Abstract = {{The transport of Cd in alluvial gravels was investigated using batch
   tests and miscible displacement experiments with large and small
   columns. Batch tests indicates that Cd adsorption fitted the Freundlich
   isotherm reasonably well and was highly nonlinear. The sorption of Cd
   under batch conditions was essentially complete within a few minutes,
   followed by a time-dependent slow sorption in weeks. A large column (200
   cm long, 19 cm diameter) was injected with pulse solutions containing
   Cd, Br, Cl, and rhodamine WT at pore-water velocities of 20 and 61
   m/day; while the small column (18 cm long, 10 cm diameter) was injected
   with Br and Cd pulses at pore-water velocities of 18 and 58 m/day.
   Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of Cd were highly asymmetric while those of
   other solutes were essentially symmetric, suggesting the presence of a
   non-equilibrium component for the Cd transport. This was further
   evidenced by decreases in Cd concentrations when flow was interrupted.
   Under all conditions investigated, asymmetry in Cd BTCs essentially
   resulted from chemical non-equilibrium as physical non-equilibrium was
   not present. Both equilibrium and non-equilibrium models, as
   incorporated in CXTFIT, were used to describe observed BTCs of Cd.
   Dispersivity was obtained from the nonreactive solute Br data, and it
   was then held constant for the other solutes. The retardation factor (R)
   values were estimated based on results from batch tests and the time
   moment method. For comparison purposes, the R values of the Cd data were
   also simulated from the two-site models. The values of the partitioning
   coefficient (beta) and the mass transfer coefficient (omega) were
   estimated from two-region/site models. Modelling results suggest that
   (1) Cd transport was mainly controlled by rate-limited sorption; (2) the
   scale effect on Cd transport was minor for the reasonably well sorted
   material investigated, with a slight increase in the degree of
   equilibrium in the large column. Small columns may be used to obtain
   fast experimental results for homogeneous medium. However, if
   heterogeneity and preferential flow is important, larger columns are
   recommended. (3) it was evidenced that the degree of chemical
   non-equilibrium increased with increasing pore-water velocities, however
   the change was not major for the flow rates investigated (18-61 m/day);
   and (4) equilibrium models could provide apparently good fits to skewed
   BTCs by overestimating dispersivity, which incorporates all the effects
   from the dispersion and diffusion within both mobile and immobile liquid
   phases and/or type-1 and type-2 sorption sites. Comparatively,
   non-equilibrium models described the Cd data better and provided a more
   correct explanation for the spreading and asymmetry of the Cd BTC. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, comparison is made of terms describing solubilization of
   hydrophobic organic compounds (HOC) by dissolved humic substances (DHS)
   and commercial non-ionic surfactants. This paper examines the ability of
   a commercial humic acid (Aldrich humic acid) to solubilize and mobilize
   tetrachlorothene (PCE) residual in porous media. The constant for
   solubilization of PCE by Aldrich humic acid is shown to be a factor of
   two to thirty times less than that published for dodecyl alcohol
   ethoxylate surfactants, showing that Aldrich humic acid is less capable
   than some non-ionic surfactants at solubilizing residual PCE. The
   depression of PCE-water interfacial tension in the presence of DHS is
   shown to be significantly less than published values for a non-ionic
   surfactant, and surfactant mixtures, indicating that the DHS used in
   this study is less prone to cause mobilization of non-aqueous phase
   liquids relative to surfactants. Several possible advantages of DHS use
   in the remediation of subsurface media contaminated with HOC are
   described, including the ability of DHS to solubilize HOC irrespective
   of the DHS concentration, and potential lesser tendency of DHS to
   depress the interfacial tension between non-aqueous phases and water
   relative to surfactants (an advantage when mobilization is undesired).

Abstract = {{The design of in-situ remediation of contaminated soils is mostly based
   on a description at the macroscopic scale using averaged quantities.
   These cannot address issues at the pore and pore network scales. In this
   paper, visualization experiments and numerical simulations in pore
   networks are carried out to understand basic aspects of mass transfer
   during the solubilization of residual non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPL).
   The experiments are carried out in 2-D etched-glass micromodels with
   randomly distributed pore sizes. The evolution of the configuration of
   the residual phase, the pressure drop across the micromodel and the
   concentration of the effluent are continuously recorded under various
   displacement conditions. A pore network numerical model, based on the
   convection-diffusion equation using appropriate modifications for the
   local mass transfer coefficients, is developed to simulate mass transfer
   during the solubilization of a residual phase. The pore network
   simulator is found to match well the experimental results, provided that
   the local mass transfer coefficients are properly modeled. Under the
   assumption of spatially uniform local mass transfer coefficients, an
   asymptotic power-law scaling between the effluent concentration and the
   Peclet number is obtained, the exponent of which is related to the local
   mass transfer expression. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Subsurface solute transport through structured soil is studied by model
   interpretation of experimental breakthrough curves from tritium and
   phosphorus tracer tests in three intact soil monoliths. Similar
   geochemical conditions, with nearly neutral pH, were maintained in all
   the experiments. Observed transport differences for the same tracer are
   thus mainly due to differences in the physical transport process between
   the different monoliths. The modelling is based on a probabilistic
   Lagrangian approach that decouples physical and chemical mass transfer
   and transformation processes from pure and stochastic advection.
   Thereby, it enables explicit quantification of the physical transport
   process through preferential flow paths, honouring all independently
   available experimental information. Modelling of the tritium
   breakthrough curves yields a probability density function of
   non-reactive solute travel time that is coupled with a reaction model
   for linear, non-equilibrium sorption-desorption to describe the
   phosphorus transport. The tritium model results indicate that
   significant preferential flow occurs in all the experimental soil
   monoliths, ranging from 60-100\% of the total water flow moving through
   only 25-40\% of the total water content. In agreement with the fact that
   geochemical conditions were similar in all experiments, phosphorus model
   results yield consistent first-order kinetic parameter values for the
   sorption-desorption process in two of the three soil monoliths;
   phosphorus transport through the third monolith cannot be modelled
   because the apparent mean transport rate of phosphorus is anomalously
   rapid relative to the non-adsorptive tritium transport. The occurrence
   of preferential flow alters the whole shape of the phosphorus
   breakthrough curve, not least the peak mass flux and concentration
   values, and increases the transported phosphorus mass by 2-3 times
   relative to the estimated mass transport without preferential now in the
   two modelled monoliths. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The truncation errors associated with finite difference solutions of the
   advection-dispersion equation with first-order reaction are formulated
   from a Taylor analysis. The error expressions are based on a general
   form of the corresponding difference equation and a temporally and
   spatially weighted parametric approach is used for differentiating among
   the various finite difference schemes. The numerical truncation errors
   are defined using Peclet and Courant numbers and a new Sink/Source
   dimensionless number. It is shown that all of the finite difference
   schemes suffer from truncation errors. Tn particular it is shown that
   the Crank-Nicolson approximation scheme does not have second order
   accuracy for this case. The effects of these truncation errors on the
   solution of an advection-dispersion equation with a first order reaction
   term are demonstrated by comparison with an analytical solution. The
   results show that these errors are not negligible and that correcting
   the finite difference scheme for them results in a more accurate
   solution. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many numerical computer codes used to simulate multi-species reactive
   transport and biodegradation have been developed in recent years. Such
   numerical codes must be validated by comparison of the numerical
   solutions with an analytical solution. In this paper, a method for
   deriving analytical solutions of the partial differential equations
   describing multiple species multi-dimensional transport with first-order
   sequential reactions is presented. Although others have developed
   specific solutions of multi-species transport equations, here a more
   general analytical approach, capable of describing any number of
   reactive species in multiple dimensions is derived. A substitution
   method is used to transform the multi-species reactive transport problem
   to one that can be solved using previously published single-species
   solutions for various initial and boundary conditions. One- and
   three-dimensional examples are presented to illustrate the steps
   involved in extending single-species solutions to a four-species system
   with sequential first-order reactions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Argillaceous rock formations are targets of exploration for radioactive
   waste disposal sites in several countries. Groundwater flow in most
   indurated argillaceous rocks is very limited and occurs (if at all)
   mainly in brittle discontinuities, such as faults. On the basis of
   surface observations, core logging and hydraulic measurements in
   boreholes penetrating an argillaceous marl formation in the Swiss Alps,
   the relationships between internal fault architecture, larger-scale
   arrangement of the fault network and fault transmissivity are explored.
   Only a fraction of all faults observed in the cores correlates with
   water inflow points into the boreholes, and this is taken as evidence of
   variable transmissivity within each fault. Such flow channeling is also
   supported by geologic evidence. Stochastic discrete fracture network
   models are used for the upscaling of measured fault transmissivities,
   namely for the calculation of effective hydraulic conductivities (K-eff)
   of model cubes with lengths of side of 50-500 m. Input data to these
   models include size, spacing, orientation, heterogeneity (flow
   channeling) and transmissivity of the faults. Fault size is not well
   known, but a sensitivity analysis shows that even the extreme assumption
   of infinite size yields K-eff only less than 1 order of magnitude higher
   when compared to the base case. The effect of different arrangements of
   flow channels within each fault is also explored but has no appreciable
   effect on K-eff. It is concluded that calculated values for K-eff are
   robust because those input parameters that are least adequately known
   have only Limited effects on the model results. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Results are reported for migration experiments performed with Np under
   in situ geochemical conditions over a range of groundwater flow rates in
   columns of crushed rock in a specially designed facility at the
   240-level of the Underground Research Laboratory (URL) near Pinawa,
   Manitoba, Canada. This laboratory is situated in an intrusive granitic
   rock formation, the Lac du Bonnet batholith. Highly altered granitic
   rock and groundwater were obtained from a major subhorizontal fracture
   zone at a depth of 250 m in the URL, The granite was wet-crushed and
   wet-sieved with groundwater from this fracture zone. The 180-850-mu m
   size fraction was selected and packed in 20-cm long, 2.54-cm in diameter
   Teflon(TM)-lined stainless steel columns. Approximately 30-ml vols of
   groundwater containing (HHO)-H-3 and Np-237 were injected into the
   columns at flow rates of 0.3, 1, and 3 ml/h, followed by elution with
   groundwater, obtained from the subhorizontal fracture, at the same flow
   rates, for a period of 95 days. Elution profiles for (HHO)-H-3 were
   obtained, but no Np-237 was detected in the eluted groundwater. After
   terminating the migration experiments, the columns were frozen, the
   column material was removed and cut into twenty 1-cm thick sections and
   each section was analyzed by gamma spectrometry. Profiles of Np-237 were
   obtained for the three columns. A one-dimensional transport model was
   fitted to the (HHO)-H-3 breakthrough curves to obtain flow parameters
   for this experiment. These flow parameters were in turn applied to the
   Np-237 concentration profiles in the columns to produce sorption and
   dispersion coefficients for Np. The results show a strong dependence of
   retardation factors (R-f) on flow rate. The decrease in the retarded
   velocity of the neptunium (V-n) varied over one order of magnitude under
   the geochemical conditions for these experiments. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sorption and diffusion behavior of Se in tuff was studied by batch
   sorption and through-diffusion experiments, Tuff samples used in the
   experiments were obtained from the Toki Lignite-Bearing Formation, Tone
   area, Gifu, central Japan. The experiments were carried out in a
   nitrogen glove-box with an oxygen level less than 1 ppm at room
   temperature. Batch sorption experiments of Se on crushed tuff samples
   and its constituent minerals were carried out in the pH range between 2
   and 13. The fraction of Se sorbed on tuff was above 90\% in the pH range
   below 8 and decreased to below 30\% with increasing pH. Comparison of pH
   dependencies of sorption between tuff and its constituent minerals
   suggested that Fe minerals such as Fe-oxyhydroxide and pyrite
   contributed to Se sorption on tuff. Through-diffusion experiments of Se
   through intact tuff samples were carried out at the pH values of 8 and
   11. Effective diffusion coefficients obtained at both pH values were
   almost the same, on the other hand, the distribution coefficient
   obtained at pH 8 was higher than that at pH 11 by one order of
   magnitude. This result was consistent qualitatively with the pH
   dependency of Se sorption by the batch experiments. However, the
   distribution coefficients obtained by the diffusion experiments were
   lower than those by the batch experiments and the differences were one
   order of magnitude, Correcting the difference of specific surface areas
   for crushed and intact tuff samples could not explain the difference
   between distribution coefficients obtained by batch sorption and
   diffusion experiments. Consideration of the pore size distribution by
   the mercury porosimetry suggested that the microscopic pores with size
   below several tens of nanometers might contribute slightly to sorption.
   The assumption that the pores with size below 20 nm are not concerned
   with sorption leads to the consistency of distribution coefficients
   between batch sorption and diffusion experiments. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivity measurements have been used to investigate the
   effect of surface ion mobility in Aspo diorite. Rock tablets were
   depleted of their pore ions by leaching, leaving mostly ions in the
   electrical double layer in the pores. One of the tablets had been ion
   exchanged with Sr2+ before leaching, leaving mostly Sr2+ as the cation
   in ion exchange positions. The conductivity through the rock tablets was
   then measured at increasing pore concentrations of SrCl2 solutions for
   the ion exchanged piece and SrCl2 or NaCl solutions for the others. The
   conductivity measurements show a large contribution from the cation
   layer to the total conductivity in low salinity pore waters. For Sr2+, a
   surface diffusivity, evaluated from the conductivity, of about 2 X
   10(-13) m(2)/s, was obtained. Dp epsilon was 4 X 10(-14) m(2)/s also
   evaluated from the measurements. In low salinity waters with a K-d(Sr2+)
   of 0.01 m(3)/kg, as suggested for Swedish rock at low ionic strength
   pore water, this means that the overall effective diffusivity would be
   more than 100 times higher than if there had only been transport in the
   free pore solution. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation) have been carrying out
   a long-term programme of in situ experiments aimed at providing a more
   precise data base on transport pathways and sites of radionuclide
   retardation. Here, two experiments within this programme will be
   discussed to illustrate the use of in situ resin impregnation to better
   define in situ transport pathways and retardation sites. Details of the

Abstract = {{The sorption behaviour of uranium(VI) and selenium(IV) on a purified
   bentonite sample has been investigated and the results compared with
   those for sorption onto the unpurified material and goethite. Batch
   sorption data for U(VI) on purified bentonite show strong sorption in
   the pH range 5 to 8 (R-d > 10(4) cm(3) g(-1)). Outside this range the
   sorption decreases although the R-d remains above 10(3) cm(3) g(-1)
   across the pH range studied. U(VI) sorption was also found to decrease
   rapidly with increasing carbonate concentration. Thermodynamic modelling
   of the data indicates that sorption at low pH may be due to an
   ion-exchange process, whereas above pH 5 surface complexation dominates.
   The sorption of Se(IV) on purified bentonite was found to be significant
   only below pH 7. Sorption of Se(IV) on goethite showed a strong
   dependency on pH; with strong sorption below pH 8, and a sharp decrease
   in sorption above pH 8. Sorption of Se(IV) onto the smectite component
   of impure bentonite is therefore only likely to be significant at low pH
   and sorption is dominated by a goethite-like surface of an iron
   constituent mineral above pH 5. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments have been performed on magnetite according to the
   batch method. The sorption of three cations of three different oxidation
   states has been investigated under various pH: Cs (I) and Ba (II) which
   have long lived isotopes, and Eu (In) which can be considered as a
   chemical analogue of Am (III). Results showed that magnetite has a high
   capacity of retention for Ba2+ and Eu3+, especially under pH conditions
   expected in a deep geological disposal. Cs+ is not sorbed on a pure
   magnetite but it can be sorbed if magnetite contents some impurities
   such as silica. In this case the sorption was strongly dependent on the
   presence of other alkaline metal ions such as sodium. A good fitting of
   these experimental results has been obtained by using the surface
   complexation theory (FITEQL 3.2 code) with the diffuse layer model (DLM)
   (leading to the species = XOHBa2+, = XOBaOH, = XOHEu3+, = XOEu(OH)(2)
   with log K respectively equal to 4.05-11.50 6.43 and -14.87). (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The transport properties of Np(V) were studied in a column packed with a
   mixture of silica sand and natural clay minerals (8\% w/w), essentially
   montmorillonite and kaolinite with goethite (6.5\% of clays fraction).
   The clayey sand packing is 1.6 cm in diameter and 7 cm in length; the
   pore velocity is 3.6 m/day. Np(V) was injected as a concentration pulse
   of 8.0 10(-6) mol/l in a solution containing sodium perchlorate and
   sodium carbonate at a given pH. Np(V) was detected at the outlet and the
   distribution coefficient, Kd, was measured from the first-moment of
   peaks. The curve log(K-d) vs. pH displays a characteristic shape:
   log(K-d) firstly decreases from 1.5 at pH 8.2 to 0.5 at pH 9.8, value
   for which a minimum is observed. Then, when pH increases from 10.0 to
   11.8, log(K-d) value increases to 1.3. The theoretical interpretation of
   equilibrium properties as a function of pH takes into account
   Na+/H+/NpO2+ cation exchange on a specific site of clay minerals.
   Analysis and modelling of peak shapes show that the stronger the
   retention, the higher the reduced variance of the Np(V) peaks. This
   behaviour is interpreted in the framework of linear chromatography
   theory, which leads to attribute the evolution of reduced variance of
   peaks vs. pH to external and/or internal mass transfer limitations.
   Introducing the characteristic times of a first order kinetics allows
   one to determine the nature of mass transfer kinetics and the
   characteristic length of clayey sand aggregates. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Many countries considering radioactive waste disposal have, or are
   considering programs to study and quantify microbial effects in terms of
   their particular disposal concept. Although there is an abundance of
   qualitative information, there is a need for quantitative data.
   Quantitative research should cover topics such as the kinetics of
   microbial activity in geological media, microbial effects on
   radionuclide migration in host rock (including effects of biofilms),
   tolerance to extreme conditions of radiation, heat and desiccation,
   microbially-influenced corrosion of waste containers and microbial gas
   production. The research should be performed in relevant disposal
   environments with the ultimate objective to quantify those effects that
   need to be included in models for predictive and safety assessment
   purposes. The Canadian approach to dealing with microbial effects
   involves a combination of pertinent, quantitative measurements from
   carefully designed laboratory studies and from large scale engineering
   experiments in AECL's Underground Research Laboratory (URL). The
   validity of these quantitative data is measured against observations
   from natural environments and analogues. An example is the viability of
   microbes in clay-based sealing materials. Laboratory studies have shown
   that the clay content of these barriers strongly affects microbial
   activity and movement. This is supported by natural environment and
   analogue observations that show clay deposits to contain very old tree
   segments and dense clay lenses in sediments to contain much smaller,
   less diverse and less active microbial populations than more porous
   sediments. This approach has allowed for focused, quantitative research
   on microbial effects in Canada. Crown Copyright (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{Distribution of rare earth elements (REEs) in granitic rock has been
   studied to clarify the migration behavior of REEs in granitic rock
   during alteration. The altered and unaltered rock samples were collected
   at Toki granitic rock, central Japan. The concentrations of REEs in rock
   samples were measured by the neutron activation analysis. The
   concentrations of the light REEs (LREEs) in the altered rock samples
   were higher than those in the unaltered ones. In contrast, the
   concentrations of heavy REEs (HREEs) in the altered rock samples were
   approximately the same as those in the unaltered ones. XRD patterns show
   that clay minerals were not present in the unaltered rock samples, but
   were in the altered ones. Both the altered and unaltered rock samples
   contain apatite, zircon and xenotime, which contain REEs as minor
   components. Carbonate minerals, calcite, CaCO(3), bastnaesite,
   (LREE)(CO(3))F, and parisite, Ca(LREE)(2)(CO(3)) (3)F(2) were observed
   only in the altered rock samples. Calcite filled veins in the altered
   samples, and bastnaesite and parisite occurred with calcite. Bulk
   concentration of calcium in the altered rock are higher by a factor of
   two than those in the unaltered ones. It is concluded that both light
   REEs and calcium have migrated with hydrothermal solution, and
   precipitated as carbonate minerals. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) is ubiquitous in global aquatic systems,
   the mass concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 100 mg/l of organic carbon.
   The polydispersity of molar masses and the chemical structures
   comprising NOM give it a multifunctional role in natural environment and
   in water treatment processes. Important functions include serving as an
   electron donor in metal complexation, sorption of xenobiotics and
   adsorption onto mineral phases and onto activated carbon. NOM is
   partially oxidized during microbial utilization and during water
   treatment in which it may also become substituted with chlorine leading
   to a suite of products with toxic relevance. Meaningful methods of NOM
   characterization would be useful for the development of a predictive
   capacity for NOM behaviour in different water sources. Among analytical
   characterization methods, those directly applicable to aqueous samples
   are most useful and in addition to classical spectroscopic methods, more
   advanced methods have become available within the last decade. High
   pressure liquid chromatography using gels have proved useful in
   combination with UV/vis, fluorescence, light scattering and sensitive
   dissolved organic carbon detection techniques, yielding information on
   molecular absorbance, size distribution, molar mass and reactivity.
   information on biodegradability of NOM can be deduced from experimental
   measurement of bacterial growth under defined conditions. The nature and
   amount of biologically assimilable organic carbon (AOC) in combination
   with the bacterial cell number and growth rate constants can provide a
   meaningful characterization of microbial stability in aquatic systems.
   In addition, determination of directly available and acid or
   enzymatically hydrolysable amino acids and carbohydrates can add to the
   understanding of NOM biodegradability over different time scales. The
   paper gives the results obtained by the application of the different
   methods for the characterization of aquatic NOM and its fractions of
   different origin. It can be shown that the availability of advanced
   characterization techniques offers the potential for predicting the
   functionality of aquatic NOM without precise knowledge of the chemical
   structures present in the macromolecular complex. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We report on bio-catalyzed reduction and immobilization of U(VI) species
   (0.25 mg/l to 235 mg/l) in ground water in the presence of high
   concentrations of nitrate, sulfate and carbonate, We studied ground
   water from the uranium mill tailings site near Tuba City, Arizona (USA).
   Experiments with the ground water were conducted in the presence of the
   Navajo sandstone host rock. Uranium in solution is complexed by
   carbonate. Two indigenous denitrifying bacteria were identified
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri, and one sulfate reducing
   bacterium, Shewanella putrefaciens, also known as Fe(III)-reducer. S.
   putrefaciens can use U(VI) as an electron acceptor, instead of Fe(III).
   Ethanol was used as the organic carbon source. Microbially mediated
   reactions are sequential in the order of decreasing redox intensity.
   Metabolic reduction of nitrate to gaseous species (N-2, N2O) was
   complete within 1 week at 16 degrees C. The sulfate concentration
   remained constant. Some of the U(VI) coprecipitated with
   aragonite/calcite or was adsorbed on biomass during denitrification.
   Subsequently, the enzymatically catalyzed reduction of U(VI) to U(IV)
   was complete within 3 weeks but was accompanied by reduction of sulfate
   to sulfide. U(IV) precipitated as a uraninite solid solution (U, Ca)O-2,
   adhering to the bacteria. The final concentration in solution was less
   than or equal to 1 mu g/l. U(VI) was not reduced by sulfide.
   Complexation of U(VI) by carbonate made its reduction by sulfide even
   slower than in pure water. The bio-catalyzed reaction is the faster
   process under the conditions given by the composition of the ground
   water. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The migration of uranium through siliceous porous media has been
   investigated by conducting a series of con flood experiments in
   conjunction with the development of predictive coupled chemical
   transport models, Initial investigations made during the programme have
   demonstrated that under oxidising conditions, at pH approximate to 5-6
   with NaCl concentrations approximate to 0.3 mol dm(-3), uranium is
   strongly retarded by adsorption to a Clashach Sandstone matrix. Sorption
   has been shown to be largely reversible, dependent on the absolute
   concentrations involved and on the finite sorptive capacity of the rock.
   Comparative experimental and modelling studies have also demonstrated
   the sorptive behaviour of the Clashach Sandstone to be close to that of
   amorphous silica. Recent work has focused on assessing the role of EDTA
   and cellulose degradation products in enhancing uranium mobility by
   complexation/chelation. Laboratory scale migration experiments involving
   radio-labelled EDTA and saccharic acid have been supported by batch
   sorption studies to investigate the behaviour of the U-EDTA-silica and
   U-saccharic acid-silica systems. In order to obtain unequivocal
   comparisons of the rates of uranium migration in the presence and
   absence of the organic complexant, parallel column floods have been
   carried out such that intact cores of Clashach Sandstone have been
   flooded with waters from the same reservoirs at carefully controlled
   flow rates. Geochemical modelling techniques have been used to assess
   the chemical speciation of the waters, to describe the sorption
   behaviour observed in the batch sorption studies and, where appropriate,
   derive model specific data to allow predictive coupled chemical
   transport modelling of the migration experiments. It is shown that, for
   a pre-equilibrated uranium-organic system, the use of conventional
   techniques encompassing complexation in the aqueous phase and reversible
   adsorption of organically-bound species would give a reasonable
   approximation of the system. Conversely, where uranium is introduced
   ahead of the organic plume, rc-mobilisation is severely constrained by
   slow desorption kinetics. The results point to the need to consider the
   sequence of radionuclide interactions with organic waste components in
   formulating models used in performance assessment. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Multi-tracer tests with both solutes and particles allow to parametrise
   heterogenous porous media on the basis of the dual porosity model. In
   soil column experiments both solute and particle tracers were measured
   on-line at the outflow of the column. For the on-line measurement of
   particles we developed a flow cytometer with a sensitivity of one single
   microsphere in 1 ml of water. The microspheres used are latex spheres of
   1 mu m diameter, labeled with a fluorescent dye. The technique is based
   on the excitation of microspheres with a small diode laser. If a
   microsphere passes the laser focus the incorporated dye molecules emit
   fluorescent light. These photons are sampled by a Single-Photon-Counting
   Avalanche-Diode. The maximum flow rate through the instrument is 1
   ml/min with a detection efficiency of up to 90\%. The instrument is
   working stably over a time period of several weeks and has been tested
   under field conditions. The solute tracer we use is uranine, which is
   detected with a sensitive fluorimeter. Extreme sensitivity of the
   detectors is necessary to resolve tails of breakthrough curves which
   contain information on the structure of the medium. Laboratory columns
   were filled with a mixture of quartzsand (250-500 mu m) and cellpore
   filter cylinders with an internal pore size of similar to 35 mu m. The
   measured breakthrough curves show, that because of the highly reduced
   matrix diffusion of colloids, their first breakthrough can be up to 2.25
   times faster than the first breakthrough of uranine. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Migration experiments were performed to study the influence of aquatic
   humic substances on the transport behavior of Am-241(III). Four
   groundwaters with different humic substance concentrations (DOC: 1 to 80
   mg/l) were sampled together with Pleistocene aeolian quartz sand from
   the Gorleben site. Sand, groundwaters and humic substances were
   characterized by different analytical methods (e.g., ICP-MS, X-ray
   diffraction, X-ray fluorescence analysis, ultrafiltration). The sand was
   equilibrated with each groundwater under inert gas atmosphere with 1\%
   CO2 for a period of at least 3 months. As confirmed by ultrafiltration,
   the size distribution of humic colloids remained unchanged during
   equilibration. The hydraulic properties of sand columns were
   characterized with tritiated water as an inert tracer. Column and batch
   experiments were carried out with each groundwater as a function of the
   reaction period and flow velocity. In addition, the influence of the
   equilibration period of Am with groundwater was investigated prior to
   the injection into a column. The results revealed that increasing humic
   substance concentration reduced the Am sorption onto sand and enhanced
   the transport as colloid-borne Am species. The migration of
   colloid-borne Am was slightly faster than the groundwater flow velocity.
   Furthermore, the mi,oration behavior of Am was found to depend on
   kinetically controlled interaction of humic colloid-bound Am with the
   sand surface. The application of the laboratory data to natural
   conditions was examined. The results were found applicable for the
   assessment of humic colloid facilitated radionuclide migration in
   natural aquifers. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   of charged spherical colloidal particles on the colloid diameter and

   less than unity. This means that the diffusion of a charged colloidal
   particle is slowed down through the friction induced on the colloidal
   particle by the electrostatic interaction in the binary system. The
   ratio was calculated by generalized Langevin equation, and it was found
   that the calculated ratio agreed well with the experimental ratio.
   Diffusion behavior of a charged colloidal particle through quartz powder

Abstract = {{The influence of fracture aperture variability on transport of a

   the effective specific surface area, or flow wetted surface area, are

   advection and dispersion in a channel, molecular diffusion in the
   stagnant water zones and matrix diffusion. In a first step, constant
   fracture aperture, it is shown that matrix diffusion is multidimensional
   and that stagnant water is a major pathway for the diffusive mass
   transfer into the rock matrix. In a second step, the impact of aperture
   variability on transport in the channel and transport in stagnant water
   is studied by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. The best expression of
   the effective specific surface area is found to be the inverse of the

Abstract = {{Deep argillaceous formations are potential host media for radioactive
   waste disposal. The French institute of Protection and Nuclear Safety
   (ZPSN) is developing in situ studies concerning the confining properties
   of this kind of geological barrier at the Tournemire tunnel site
   (Aveyron, France). The past research programme covered physical and
   physico-chemical properties of the consolidated argillaceous medium,
   diffusive and convective transport; rock and water chemistry and
   long-term behaviour of the host rock. Investigations conclude that fluid
   circulations in the unperturbed matrix are very slow. However, past
   tectonic events have induced fractures which might accelerate these
   circulations. The hydraulic role of fractures in this type of rocks is
   poorly known. A detailed study of the role of these fractures is
   presently under way. Moreover, the 100-year old tunnel exhibits a very
   clear `Excavation-Damaged Zone' (EDZ), with large fractures which might
   drain water rather quickly over long distances. The mechanical,
   hydraulic and physico-chemical properties of the EDZ are being
   investigated. The present paper summarizes the results obtained so far
   at Tournemire, and the current research orientations. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{When designing investigations of microbial populations in the
   subsurface, it is extremely valuable to undertake scoping calculations
   to estimate the likely microbial abundances and evaluate the effects of
   contamination during sampling. A biogeochemical assessment of the
   groundwater and lithologies of the Tono mine, Japan, has been made using
   the BGS/NAGRA computer code BGSE (Bacterial Growth in Subsurface
   Environments). This code enables an assessment to be made of the maximum
   microbial growth rates that may be achieved in ideal circumstances,
   based on availability of nutrients and energy calculated from
   mineralogical and groundwater analyses. The effect of drilling
   fluid/groundwater mixing on biomass was assessed using a hypothetical
   drilling fluid composition. The results of modelling the mixing between
   groundwater and drilling fluid shows that the addition of only small
   concentrations of drilling fluid (<1\% (v/v)) to the groundwater gives
   rise to significant microbial growth rates for the systems studied.
   Maximum growth rates were observed at ratios of 50:50 (v/v)
   (groundwater: drilling fluid) for the Akeyo and Toki lower groundwaters,
   and ratios of 90:10 (v/v) (groundwater:drilling fluid) for the Toki
   upper and Granite groundwaters. At low ratios of drilling fluid (< 1\%
   (v/v)) the limiting factor in each system was the availability of an
   energy source. This reflects the fact that the system is approaching
   pristine conditions. However, there was sufficient energy to permit a
   significant growth rate to be observed. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Contamination of the subsurface by nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) is a
   widespread problem. To investigate the behavior of a nonspreading, dense
   NAPL (DNAPL) in the vadose zone, we conducted perchloroethylene (PCE)
   infiltration experiments in nominally 1- and 2-dimensional (D),
   stratified porous media. In addition, the usefulness and limitations of
   a multifluid flow simulator to describe PCE infiltration and
   redistribution under the experimental conditions were tested. The
   physical simulations were conducted in a column (1-D) and a flow
   container (2-D) which were packed with two distinct layers of
   coarse-grained sand and a fine-grained sand layer in between. Volumetric
   water and PCE contents were determined with a fully automated
   dual-energy gamma radiation system. While migrating through the drier
   parts of the coarse-grained sand layers, PCE appeared to wet the
   water-air interface rather than displacing any water. In the wetter
   parts of the porous medium, PCE displaced water and behaved as a true
   nonwetting fluid. PCE showed a limited response to gradients in
   capillary pressure and rather high values for the volumetric PCE content
   were measured in the fine-grained sand layers. This was attributed to
   the nonspreading nature of PCE. The multifluid flow simulator appeared
   to predict the initial PCE movement in the vadose zone reasonably well.
   However, the model was not capable of predicting the final amounts of
   PCE retained in either the unsaturated of saturated part of the flow
   domain, mainly because the simulator does not consider the nonspreading
   flow behavior of NAPLs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The objectives of this research were to quantify the extent of
   cosolvency for water-gasoline mixtures containing ethanol and to
   identify appropriate modeling tools for predicting the equilibrium
   partitioning of BTEX compounds and ethanol between an ethanol-bearing
   gasoline and water. Batch-equilibrium experiments were performed to
   measure ethanol and BTEX partitioning between a gasoline and aqueous
   phase. The experiments incorporated simple binary and multicomponent
   organic mixtures comprised of as many as eight compounds as well as
   highly complex commercial gasolines where the composition of the organic
   phase was not completely defined. At high ethanol volume fractions, the
   measured partition coefficients displayed an approximate linear
   relationship when plotted on semi-log scale as a function of ethanol
   volume fraction. At lower concentrations, however, there was a
   distinctly different trend which is attributed to a change in
   solubilization mechanisms at these concentrations. Three mathematical
   models were compared with or fit to the experimental results. Log-linear
   and UNIFAC-based models were used in a predictive capacity and were
   capable of representing the overall increase in partition coefficients
   as a function of increasing ethanol content in the aqueous phase.
   However, neither of these predicted the observed two-part curve. A
   piecewise model comprised of a linear relationship for low ethanol
   volume fractions and a log-linear model for higher concentrations was
   fit to data for a surrogate gasoline comprised of eight compounds and
   was then used to predict BTEX concentrations in the aqueous phase
   equilibrated with three different commercial gasolines. This model was
   superior to the UNIFAC predictions, especially at the low aqueous
   ethanol concentrations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We studied soil and ground water samples from the tailings disposal site
   near Tuba City, AZ, located on Navajo sandstone, in terms of uranium
   adsorption and precipitation. The uranium concentration is up to 1 mg/l,
   20 times the maximum concentration for ground water protection in the
   United States. The concentration of bicarbonate (HCO;) in the ground
   water increased from less than or equal to 7 x 10(-4) M, the background
   concentration, to 7 x 10(-3) M. Negatively charged uranium carbonate
   complexes prevail at high carbonate concentrations and uranium is not
   adsorbed on the negatively charged mineral surfaces. Leaching
   experiments using contaminated and uncontaminated sandstone and 1 N HCl
   show that adsorption of uranium from the ground water is negligible.
   Batch adsorption experiments with the sandstone and ground water at 16
   degrees C, the in situ ground water temperature, show that uranium is
   not adsorbed, in agreement with the results of the leaching experiments.
   Adsorption of uranium at 16 degrees C is observed when the contaminated
   ground water is diluted with carbonate-free water. The observed increase
   in pH from 6.7 to 7.3 after dilution is too small to affect adsorption
   of uranium on the sandstone. Storage of undiluted ground water to 24
   degrees C, the temperature in the laboratory, causes coprecipitation of
   uranium with aragonite and calcite. Our study provides knowledge of the
   on-site uranium chemistry that can be used to select the optimum ground
   water remediation strategy. We discuss our results in terms of ground
   water remediation strategies such as pump and treat, in situ
   bioremediation, steam injection, and natural flushing. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR) had previously been
   thought to require a capillary barrier below the contaminated zone to
   prevent the vertical migration of a microemulsion containing solubilized
   DNAPL. This paper shows the vertical migration of the dense
   microemulsion is described and predicted by the value of three
   dimensionless scaling groups. Embedded within these scaling groups are
   four design parameters. The value of these parameters can be manipulated
   in order to reduce the amount of vertical migration anticipated for a
   given remediation design. Plots have been constructed that illustrate
   the relationship between vertical migration and the value of the scaling
   groups; such plots can be used to predict vertical migration and to
   determine appropriate screen intervals of extraction wells to ensure
   full capture of the contaminants. This predictive capability has been
   verified in laboratory experiments. Predicted migration of the
   microemulsion agreed within about 2\% of that observed Development of
   the scaling groups is presented, remediation design implications are
   discussed, and laboratory verification is shown. Additional discussion

Abstract = {{Even in the absence of mobilization of dense nonaqueous phase liquid
   (DNAPL), the microemulsion that forms when the surfactant solubilizes a
   dense contaminant such as trichloroethylene will be more dense than
   water and tends to migrate downward. This paper addresses the issue of
   migration with a new concept: surfactant enhanced aquifer remediation at
   neutral buoyancy. Laboratory results of surfactant remediation in
   two-dimensional model aquifers show that downward migration of
   microemulsion containing solubilized dense contaminants can be reduced
   to an acceptable level, even in the absence of capillary barriers in the
   aquifer. One model experiment was designed to exhibit a small degree of
   vertical migration and full capture of the microemulsion at the
   extraction well. The second experiment was designed to demonstrate the
   effect of large buoyancy forces that lead to excessive downward
   migration of the microemulsion. Density measurements of aqueous
   solutions containing sodium dihexyl sulfosuccinate surfactant,
   isopropanol, trichloroethylene, and sodium chloride are presented. A
   companion paper presents the results of the flow and transport
   calculations needed for this approach to surfactant flooding. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This study presents results of flow-tank experiments on variable-density
   flow in a layered system. Less dense water displaced more dense water in
   a system layered with a lower over a higher hydraulic conductivity unit.
   This configuration created a potentially unstable interface between the
   displaced water and the displacing water. The displacing water wedge
   (i.e., less dense water) in the higher hydraulic conductivity layer
   traveled downgradient faster than the displacing water wedge moving in
   the layer above. Downward movement of more dense water from the upper
   layer into the freshwater wedge in the lower layer caused the latter to
   become more saline. Flow rate and density difference between displacing
   and displaced water, and hydraulic conductivity difference between
   layers, were each analyzed for their effect on mixing behavior in this
   system. Fluid movement and mixing processes were monitored using time
   sequence photography. Digital processing of black and white negatives
   provided a large and semi-continuous data base of concentration values
   to analyze the salinization of the displacing water. In many cases, the
   unstable stratification and density gradient also promoted the upward
   growth of finger-shaped instabilities into the less permeable layer. An
   analytical stability analysis was able to reasonably predict the
   wavelength of these fingers. Results from the experiments suggest that
   density variations can promote complex flow and mixing patterns in even
   the simple layered systems considered herein. This conclusion has
   important implications for both contaminant transport and fluid
   displacement processes occurring during remediation. (C) 1998 Published

Abstract = {{Our objective is to describe two non-invasive monitoring techniques that
   could provide an alternative to traditional water sampling in
   small-scale tank experiments. Here, a dense plume was monitored both
   electrically and visually using probes emplaced in a three-dimensional
   sand tank. Long, clear glass-tubes, which were modified by the addition
   of conductive copper tapes and connecting wires, were installed in a
   vertical array in the tank. The plume was monitored using Rhodamine WT
   (RWT) as a tracer and a conductive solution of NaCl. Appropriate
   consideration for the confined boundaries is applied to the resistivity
   calculations. The resistivity measurements with the emplaced electrodes
   perform well in tracking the denser plume. The visual monitoring of the
   optical tracer was conducted using a flexible endoscope with a 90
   degrees mirror. The endoscope transmits the images through a CCD camera
   to a VCR. This visual monitoring system also provides an excellent
   capability to determine the location of the RWT plume. Results from both
   methods compare well with each other. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation of advective solute transport requires
   approximation of two vectors: the concentration gradient and the
   velocity. Estimation of the concentration gradient by Eulerian solution
   techniques gives rise to classical `numerical dispersion' since the
   truncation error is of the form del(2)C. Truncation of the velocity
   vector has escaped close scrutiny because the velocity field generally
   varies slowly in space in most groundwater environments. However, in
   many problems, including saltwater intrusion, the velocity field is
   highly variable and error associated with velocity approximation
   strongly affects the solution. particle-tracking (Lagrangian) algorithms
   create a non-uniform error vector within each numerical block. The
   non-uniform error gives rise to differential advective flux that mimics
   the effects of classical numerical dispersion. Since the velocity
   truncation error vector depends on the size of a numerical block,
   Lagrangian methods may require extremely fine discretization of the
   underlying pressure grid. A finite-difference Lagrangian
   variable-density flow and transport code shows slow convergence to a
   `correct' solution of Henry's and related problems of saltwater
   intrusion as the grid density is changed. On the other hand, an Eulerian
   finite element code is shown to have a uniform velocity error vector
   within each element and the solution converges quickly as the grid
   density is changed. This suggests that the usual computational advantage
   that Lagrangian transport algorithms gain by using coarse grids is lost
   when modeling transport within highly variable velocity fields. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A new computer code (MITSU3D) has been developed to simulate variable

   preconditioned conjugate gradient-type methods employing a
   block-incomplete LU factorization and reduced system preconditioning.
   Numerical simulations involving contaminant migration in a
   two-dimensional cross-section show MITSU3D to be much faster and more
   robust than SUTRA. MITSU3D successfully avoids an ``error-driven{''}
   contaminant plume instability in a coarse grid discretization and shows
   increased performance by a factor of five. The enhanced speed and
   robustness will enable us to examine much larger coupled problems than

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional, coupled variable-density flow and transport simulations
   with heterogeneous media advance understanding of how local-scale
   non-idealities create and control instabilities. Dense plumes (5000 mg
   l(-1) NaCl) are introduced into a domain (1.50 x 0.56 m) with
   synthetically generated permeability fields. Simulations with the first
   set of realizations {[}mean permeability (k)= 5.7 x 10(-11) m(2), In(k)
   variance = 0.25, longitudinal correlation length (tau(x)) = 0.10 m,
   transverse correlation length (tau(z)) = 0.02 m] illustrate how the
   lower plume boundary is naturally perturbed by local-scale
   heterogeneities. Some of these perturbations are stable, some are highly
   bounded or pseudostable in certain portions of the field, while others
   rapidly destabilize the lower plume boundary. Even with similar
   macroscopic field statistics, widely varying degrees of density-induced
   mixing occur among different realizations. Unstable perturbations result
   in complex mixing features, such as coalescing of instability lobes as
   different portions of the plume sample various regions of the
   permeability field. Such mixing greatly enhances and controls the
   dispersion process. Based on the control that local field
   characteristics exhibit on instability growth and decay, the
   applicability of stability criteria to plume-type displacements in
   natural heterogeneous media is likely inappropriate. Additional
   simulations employing fields of lower variance and lower densities
   illustrate the delicate balance between these variables and the ability
   of the field to propagate unstable perturbations. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The development of a dense solute plume in a fractured geologic medium
   can be highly irregular due to both the complexity of the fracture
   network as well as the presence of convection cells that may arise as a
   result of the density contrast between the invading solute and the
   ambient groundwater. A two-dimensional numerical model has been
   developed here to investigate density-dependent groundwater flow and
   solute transport in geologic materials that contain discrete fractures
   in order to examine some of the complex forms into which plumes can
   evolve, particularly with regard to fracture-matrix interactions.
   Results from simulations which involve parallel vertical fractures show
   that the evolution of the solute plume is affected by the development of
   convection cells in the porous matrix blocks between the vertical
   fractures. In a geologic medium containing a network of regularly spaced
   horizontal and vertical fractures, complex migration pathways can
   develop that are unexpected even though the geometry and
   interconnectivity of the fractures are known a priori. Downward solute
   migration can occur in some vertical fractures, while upward migration
   of less dense fluid can occur in others with transient circulation
   patterns developing in the intervening porous matrix. Because of the
   inherent uncertainty associated with fracture delineation, and because
   of the irregular nature of unstable dense plumes, deterministic
   prediction of dense-plume migration pathways and travel times in
   fractured geologic media will be subject to considerable uncertainty.

Abstract = {{The role of rye as a winter cover crop to reduce nitrate leaching was
   investigated over a three-year period on a loamy sand soil. A cover crop
   was planted after corn in the early fall and killed in late March or
   early April the following spring. No-tillage and conventional tillage
   systems were compared on large plots with irrigated corn. A replicated
   randomized block design experiment was conducted on small plots to
   evaluate a rye cover crop under no-tillage and conventional tillage and
   with commercial fertilizer, poultry manure and composted poultry manure
   as nitrogen fertilizer sources. Nitrogen uptake by the cover crop along
   with nitrate concentrations in groundwater and the soil profile (0-150
   cm) were measured on the large plots. Soil nitrate concentrations and
   nitrogen uptake by the cover crop were measured on the small plots.
   There was no significant difference in nitrate concentrations in the
   groundwater or soil profile with and without a cover crop in either
   no-tillage or conventional tillage. Annual amounts of nitrate-N leached
   to the water-table varied from 136.0 to 190.1 kg/ha in 1989 and from
   82.4 to 116.2 kg/ha in 1991. Nitrate leaching rates were somewhat lower
   with a cover crop in 1989, but not in 1990. There was no statistically
   significant difference in corn grain yields between the cover crop and
   non-cover crop treatments. The planting date and adequate rainfall are
   very important in maximizing nitrogen uptake in the fall with a rye
   cover crop. On the Delmarva Peninsula, the cover crop should probably be
   planted by October 1 to maximize nitrogen uptake rates in the fall. On
   loamy sand soils, rye winter cover crops cannot be counted on as a best
   management practice for reducing nitrate leaching in the Mid-Atlantic
   states. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although surfactant enhanced remediation of nonaqueous phase liquids
   (NAPLs) by pump-and-treat technology has been studied extensively in the
   laboratory with one-dimensional columns, very few multi-dimensional
   investigations have been reported. In this study we focus on the removal
   of perchloroethylene (PCE) from a two-dimensional, saturated porous
   medium containing a low permeability sand layer situated in an otherwise
   high permeability sand. A PCE spill was applied at the surface of the
   porous medium and allowed to redistribute until static equilibrium was
   achieved. The porous medium was then flushed with various surfactant and
   co-solvent formulations injected at the PCE source location and
   extracted at the bottom of the porous medium using a configuration
   similar to that of Abdul and Ang {[}Abdul, S.A., Ang, C.C., 1994. In
   situ surfactant washing of polychlorinated biphenyls and oils from a
   contaminated field site: Phase II. Pilot study. Ground Water 32,
   727-734], Effluent samples were analyzed for dissolved PCE
   concentrations. Volumetric water and PCE content values were determined
   at a number of locations by means of dual-energy gamma radiation
   measurements. Once surfactant flushing had started, PCE moved as a
   distinct separate phase ahead of the surfactant front. Most of this
   downward moving PCE accumulated on top of the low permeability sand
   layer. Some PCE, however, passed quickly through this layer and
   subsequently through the high permeability sand below it. Movement of
   some of the PCE into and through the low permeability sand layer was
   attributed to local heterogeneities combined with reduced interfacial
   tensions associated with the surfactant formulation. Clean-up of PCE in
   most of the high permeability sand was considered to be effective. PCE
   accumulated on top of the fine layer, however, posed a significant
   challenge to remediation and required several pumping configurations and
   surfactant/co-solvent formulations before most of it was removed. (C)

Abstract = {{Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), such as perchloroethylene
   (PCE), pose a significant threat to the environment, specifically to our
   drinking water present in aquifers. In many instances, a DNAPL will
   become trapped and form pools on top of confining layers while migrating
   through the vadose zone. Residual DNAPL and DNAPL pools form sources of
   long term contamination, which are difficult to remove by classical
   pump-and-treat remediation. A physically simulated PCE spill into a
   large, two-dimensional flow container, packed with a fine sand layer
   surrounded by coarse sand, was therefore studied in this work. ii water
   table was maintained near the bottom of the flow container, such that
   the coarse sand just below the fine layer was unsaturated, but the
   bottom of the fine sand layer was at or near saturation. A PCE spill was
   applied at the center of the porous medium's surface and allowed to
   redistribute until static equilibrium was reached. The porous medium was
   then flushed with a surfactant solution (Triton X-100, 4.0\% by volume),
   using the same application configuration as for the spill, while
   simultaneously extracting solution at one or more locations at the
   bottom of the porous medium. Effluent samples were analyzed for PCE
   concentrations. Volumetric water and PCE content values were determined
   several times at a number of locations by means of dual-energy gamma
   radiation measurements. The coarse sand in the upper portion of the
   porous medium was cleaned rapidly by the surfactant flushing. Removal of
   PCE from the fine sand layer, however, proved to be more difficult
   because most of the surfactant solution bypassed the PCE. Lateral
   spreading of the surfactant plume occurred near the saturated/nearly
   saturated zones in the fine and coarse sand. This lateral spreading,
   unfortunately, allowed for solubilized PCE, the concentration of which
   was enhanced by micelle formation, to move into regions previously
   uncontaminated. The pumping configuration was subsequently changed in an
   attempt to force the surfactant solution through the entire fine layer,
   i.e., to hydraulically control the surfactant flushing, while
   simultaneously increasing the amount of solubilized PCE. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a 3-D coupled model of subsurface
   flow, heat transfer, and reactive chemical transport where the local
   equilibrium assumption is applied. Strong coupling is used for
   steady-state simulations, while weak coupling may be employed for
   transient simulations to save computation time. Four types of boundary
   conditions and a complete suite of geochemical reactions are taken into
   account. The flow equation is discretized by the Galerkin finite element
   method. Both the reactive chemical transport and heat transfer equations
   are solved by either the hybrid Lagrangian-Eulerian or the conventional
   Eulerian finite element method. Two approaches are considered to compute
   the transport of aqueous components. The Picard method is used to handle
   non-linearity in both reactive chemical transport and unsaturated
   subsurface flow, while the Newton-Raphson method is employed to
   calculate chemical equilibrium. Two realistic, albeit hypothetical
   example problems are used to demonstrate the capability of the model.

Abstract = {{In the framework of the Migration Experiment at the Grimsel Test Site,
   Switzerland, breakthrough experiments with a conservative tracer,
   uranine, and sorbing cationic gamma-emitting radionuclides (Na-22,24(+),
   Sr-85(2+), Rb-86(+), and Cs-137(+)) were carried out to test models of
   radionuclide migration in the field. An array of bore holes drilled from
   an experimental drift penetrated a transmissive, water-saturated shear
   zone in a granodiorite. The shear zone consists of a set of fractures
   filled with a fine-grained porous fault gouge. A two bore hole
   injection-withdrawal ('dipole') now field was superimposed on the
   natural hydraulic gradient and two different linear flow distances, 1.7
   and 4.9 m, were studied in detail. The concentrations of the
   radionuclides were, in general, much smaller than the natural background
   levels of the corresponding stable isotopes of Na, Sr, Rb, and Cs, in
   the groundwater of the shear zone. In-line tracer detection techniques
   included down-hole point fluorescence measurement and NaI scintillation
   counting of gamma-emitters in the withdrawal flow line. Pulse-stimulus
   tracer injections resulted in monomodal breakthrough curves and recovery
   curves. The reduction of the maximum (peak) radionuclide activity
   (relative to the injected activity), peak retardation, and retardation
   of the time of 50\% recovery were compared to those of uranine. A.
   selectivity sequence of relative affinity of the studied cations for an
   exchange site was found to be Na (< Ca) < Sr < Rb < Cs. In the shorter
   flow field, the radionuclides exhibited little peak-height reduction
   relative to uranine and little or no retardation. In the longer flow
   field, Sr and Cs showed a considerable peak-height reduction and a
   significant retardation relative to uranine and Na. Increasing the flow
   distance affected the retardation of the radionuclides. The results were
   compared with both pre- and post-experiment model simulations and
   earlier model predictions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relationships between
   the equilibrium sorption constant (K-p), the first-order desorption rate
   coefficient (k(2)), and the volumetric fraction of water miscible
   solvent (f(c)); and to utilize SPARC-calculated (SPARC Performs
   Automatic Reasoning in Chemistry) solubility and partitioning parameters
   with empirical measurements for a priori prediction of solute sorption
   kinetics in aqueous and mixed solvent systems. Soil column miscible
   displacement experiments were performed using naphthalene, phenanthrene,
   anthracene, pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene over an f(c) range from 0.0 to
   0.8. Data from the miscible displacement studies were analyzed using a
   two-domain first-order mass transfer model to obtain K-p and k(2).
   Results corroborated and extended the range of the validity of the
   log-log linear relationship between k(2) and K-p and log-linear
   relationship between k(2) and f(c) for mixed solvent systems. In
   addition, the slope of the log k(2)-log K-p relationship was found to be
   relatively solute independent. Predicted values of k(2) in aqueous
   systems agreed well with experimentally measured values, thus,
   indicating the general applicability of the predictive approaches for
   predicting the sorption kinetics of hydrophobic organic compounds. (C)

Abstract = {{A model for contaminant transport along a discrete fracture in a porous
   rock matrix is developed and solved analytically. The focus here is on
   the dynamics of solute exchange between the matrix and a single crack
   and its effect on solute transport within the crack and the chemical
   distribution with time at any depth. A laminar boundary layer of near
   stagnant fluid exists at the interface between the fracture and the
   matrix through which a rate-limited mass transfer takes place. The flow
   and the dissolved chemical concentration normal to the flow direction
   are essentially uniform in the crack except for the boundary layer.
   Chemical concentration in the immobile porosity varies with time and
   space in the lateral direction. The driving force for the dissolved
   chemical exchange through this layer is the difference between the fluid
   concentration in the crack and the matrix concentration at the
   interface, both varying with time and space. The dissolved chemical
   concentration in the crack is modeled by the kinematic wave equation and
   the diffusion equation is used to model the dissolved chemical transport
   in the matrix. Exact analytical solutions far the matrix and crack
   equations are obtained in the Laplace domain and an approximate solution
   in the time domain for the case where zeta epsilon/s is sufficiently
   small. zeta is the dimensionless distance along the crack, epsilon is a
   dimensionless parameter obtained when dimensionless variables were
   introduced into the differential equations and boundary conditions, and
   s is the Laplace transformation variable. The deviations between the
   approximate and exact solutions for different values of epsilon and
   other variables, calculated in the Laplace domain, enable us to evaluate
   the cases where the approximate solution can be satisfactorily used. The
   solution obtained by the current model was verified by its comparison
   with BTCs measured by Neretnieks et al. (Neretnieks, I., Eriksen, T.,
   Tahtinen, P., 1982. Tracer movement in a single fissure in granitic
   rock: some experimental results and their interpretation. Water Resour.
   Res. 18, 4, pp. 849-858) for a granite core with a natural fissure
   parallel to its axis. A very good agreement was obtained between the
   measured and predicted BTCs. The physical meaning of the fitted
   parameters has been discussed. The relative role of the two rate-limited
   processes, namely film transfer and diffusion in the stagnant matrix
   solute, on the overall chemical exchange and BTC shape was analyzed by
   the non dimensional version of the mass balance equations. The
   displacement duration has been divided into two stages, Soon after its
   initiation, the chemical transfer through the stagnant film controls the
   chemical exchange between the preferential path and matrix. The duration
   of this stage depends on different properties of the system.
   Subsequently, the matrix-diffusion controls the chemical exchange
   between the two domains and the model can then be simplified by
   replacing the rate-limited transfer by a local equilibrium. For cases
   for which the current study is dealing with, the preferential flow is
   very fast and the rate-limited transfer through the stagnant film
   dominates the BTC shape. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The ability of naturally occurring microorganisms to biodegrade
   1,2-dichloroethane was examined in soil/water microcosms prepared using
   aquifer material obtained from manufacturing sites in Louisiana and
   Texas with known histories of exposure to the compound, as well as in
   aquifer samples taken from a site in Oklahoma with no known history of
   1,2-dichloroethane contamination. Biotransformation of
   1,2-dichloroethane was noted under methanogenic or sulfate reducing
   conditions in all samples. Under anaerobic conditions,
   1,2-dichloroethane was transformed to ethylene in a single step via
   reductive dihaloelimination. No other metabolites were detected in the
   reaction mixtures. Microbial adaptation appeared to be required for
   biotransformation of 1,2-dichloroethane. Lag periods ranging from 7 to 8
   weeks preceded degradation in microcosms prepared with aquifer material
   from the Texas and Oklahoma sites. In contrast, no lag period was
   evident prior to biotransformation in microcosms prepared from the
   Louisiana manufacturing site, which is consistent with field evidence
   for natural biological attenuation in situ based on analysis of the
   groundwater chemistry. Aerobic biodegradation of 1,2-dichloroethane to
   carbon dioxide was also observed after 13 weeks in aquifer material from
   the Louisiana site, but was not evident in samples from the Texas or
   Oklahoma sites following 18 weeks of incubation. The ability of
   naturally occurring microorganisms to degrade 1,2-dichloroethane has
   bearing on assessments of the fate and lifetime of the compound in the
   environment, as well as having potential application in the remediation
   of contaminated groundwater. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The concept of first-order mass transfer between mobile and immobile
   regions, which mathematically simplifies the concept of Fickian
   diffusion in stagnant areas, has often been used to describe physical
   nonequilibrium transport of solutes into natural porous media. This
   study compares the two concepts, using analytical expressions describing
   cyclic mass transfer into and out of stagnant layers. The results show
   that the first-order mass transfer concept cannot describe continuous
   diffusion into the immobile zone during period of net outward diffusion
   if the immobile zone has not filled completely during the period of net
   inward diffusion. This sets phenomenological limitations to the
   first-order mass transfer concept when short periods of relative time
   are involved; these limitations have to be compared with the practical
   Limitations to the Fickian diffusion concept. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The Copper Cliff Tailings Disposal Area, located near Sudbury, Ontario,
   covers an area of approximately 2200 ha and constitutes more than 10\%
   of the total area of all mine tailings in Canada. The area has been
   utilized since 1936, receiving sulphide-containing tailings from the
   Inco Sudbury operations. Field measurements of pore-gas oxygen and
   carbon dioxide in the vadose zone indicate that sulphide oxidation has
   progressed to depths of 1.6 m to 1.7 m within the tailings. The
   oxidation of sulphide minerals within the vadose zone, and the
   accompanying dissolution of carbonate and aluminosilicate minerals
   within these tailings releases SO4, Fe(II) and other metals to the pore
   water. In the vadose and saturated zones, concentrations of Fe and Ni
   exceed 10100 mg/l and 2210 mg/l, respectively. These high concentrations
   of dissolved metals are attenuated by a series of precipitation,
   coprecipitation and adsorption reactions. The precipitation of secondary
   sulphate and hydroxide phases also create hardpan layers at or near the
   oxidation front. Geochemical modelling of the pore-water chemistry
   suggests that pH-buffering reactions are occurring within the shallow
   oxidized zones, and that secondary-phase precipitation is occurring at
   or near the underlying hardpan and transition zones. Mineralogical study
   of the tailings confirmed the presence of jarosite, gypsum and goethite
   within the shallow tailings, suggesting that these phases are
   controlling the dissolved concentrations of Fe, SO4 and Ca. Extraction
   experiments conducted on the tailings solids indicate that the
   constituents contained in the water-soluble fraction of the shallow,
   weathered tailings are derived from the original pore water and the
   dissolution of highly soluble phases such as gypsum. The acid-leachable
   fraction of the weathered tailings accounts for up to 25\% of the heavy
   metals, and the reducible fraction may contain up to 100\% of the heavy
   metals within the shallow, weathered tailings. Based on the pore water
   profiles and the geochemistry of the tailings solids, a relative
   mobility scale of Fe = Mn = Ni = Co > Cd Zn > Cr = Pb > Cu can be
   determined. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. AU rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of anaerobic microbial redox processes was investigated
   along a 305 m long transect of a shallow landfill-leachate polluted
   aquifer. By unamended bioassays containing sediment and groundwater, 37
   samples were investigated with respect to methane production, sulfate,
   iron, and manganese reduction, and denitrification. Methane production
   was restricted to the most reduced part of the plume with rates of
   0.003-0.055 nmol CH4/g dry weight/day. Sulfate reduction was observed at
   rates of maximum 1.8 nmol SO42-/g dry weight/day along with methane
   production in the plume, but sulfate reduction was also observed further
   downgradient of the landfill. Iron reduction at rates of 5-19 nmol
   Fe(II)/g dry weight/day was observed in only a few samples, but this may
   be related to a high detection limit for the iron reducing bioassay.
   Manganese reduction at rates of maximum 2.4 nmol Mn(Il)/g dry weight/day
   and denitrification at rates of 0.2-37 nmol N2O-N/g dry weight/day were
   observed in the less reduced part of the plume. All the redox processes
   were microbial processes. In many cases, several redox processes took
   place simultaneously, but in all samples one process dominated
   accounting for more than 70\% of the equivalent carbon conversion. The
   bioassays showed that the redox zones in the plume identified from the
   groundwater composition (e.g. as methanogenic and sulfate reducing)
   locally hosted also other redox processes (e.g. iron reduction). This
   may have implications for the potential of the redox zone to degrade
   trace amounts of organic chemicals and suggests that unamended bioassays
   may be an important supplement to other approaches in characterizing the
   redox processes in an anaerobic plume. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The major ion and trace metal geochemistry of a septic system plume in a
   shallow sand aquifer was characterized to assess geochemical processes
   controlling the transport of nutrients and their release to a nearby
   wetland. The plume was generated from a 16-year-old tile bed, and is
   more than 60 m long, 40 m wide and 7 m thick. The groundwater pH at the
   site is near neutral, but up to 0.4 units lower in the plume core as a
   result of H+ generated from NH3 and DOC oxidation in the unsaturated
   zone. The plume can be divided into distinct redox zones, which show
   differences in nutrient mobility. Proximal to the tile bed, there is a
   shallow suboxic zone, with intermediate Eh values (> 400 mV), low
   concentrations of dissolved oxygen 1.0 mg/l), and elevated
   concentrations of Mn (1-3 mg/l) and nutrients (10-80 mg/l NO3-N, 1-15
   mg/l NH3-N, 0.1-1.5 mg/l PO4-P, 6-13 mg/l dissolved organic carbon). At
   the base of the aquifer, there is a reduced zone (Eh < 200 mV) with
   elevated concentrations of Fe (1-14 mg/l), PO4 and NH3, but negligible
   concentrations of NO3 (<0.01 mg/l N). Distal from the tile bed, the
   shallow groundwater is suboxic to oxic, and has elevated concentrations
   of NO3 and NH3, but negligible PO4. In the lower reduced zone, elevated
   concentrations of PO4 occur up to 60 m away. The release of groundwater
   containing even very low concentrations of PO4 ( 0.02 mg/l P) can lead
   to the development of eutrophic conditions in surface water bodies.
   Geochemical calculations indicate that, in the Mn-rich zone, the
   groundwater is close to saturation or supersaturated with respect to
   hydroxyapatite, rhodochrosite, calcite and ferrihydrite. In the reduced
   zone, the groundwater is close to saturation or supersaturated with
   respect to hydroxyapatite, vivianite, calcite and siderite. Formation of
   these phases, or related phases, are likely Limiting the concentrations
   of dissolved PO4, Fe and Mn and controlling the geochemical evolution of
   the plume. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations were carried out using a multicomponent reactive
   solute transport model to study the migration of four heavy metals
   (Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+) in a sand/bentonite mixture. The numerical
   model is capable of simulating simultaneous processes of water flow,
   advective-dispersive solute transport, and chemical reactions such as
   acid-base reaction, complexation, ion exchange, precipitation and
   dissolution. The migration of the heavy metals was simulated in a
   hypothetical sand/bentonite clay column which was assigned realistic
   physical and chemical properties and boundary conditions to model
   one-dimensional contaminant transport through a landfill barrier. The
   input leachate properties used in the model were modified from those of
   an actual leachate containing the heavy metals. The numerical
   simulations were focused on the concentration profiles of these heavy
   metals in the simulated barrier and the effect of the leachate pH on
   their mobilities. Numerical results indicate that under a nearly neutral
   leachate, the mobility of the four heavy metals follows the order Cu2+ >
   Zn2+ > Pb2+ > Cd2+. Under a more acidic leachate, the mobility order
   changes to: Cd2+ > Zn2+ > Cu2+ > Pb2+. However, the differences in
   mobility of the four heavy metals were relatively small. The leachate pH
   has a significant effect on the migration of Cd2+ and Pb2+, but has only
   limited effect on the mobility of Cu2+ and Zn2+. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The one previous analytical solution to the steady sparging problem in a
   homogeneous soil was in the boundary-layer approximation that neglects
   the vertical capillary pressure gradient. The present study gives an
   analytical solution to the full air-flow equation, with the
   corresponding boundary-layer solution for comparison. The full solution
   predicts sparging below the air-injection point, whereas the
   boundary-layer solution does not. Solutions are expressed both in terms
   of the dimensionless Kirchhoff potential theta (increasing monotonically
   with capillary pressure and air saturation also) and the dimensionless
   Stokes stream function F (mapping the pattern of air flow). Both theta
   and F show the full solution predicting more effective sparging near the
   injection point than does the boundary-layer solution. The overall
   boundary-layer relative error, however, decreases as dimensionless
   air-injection depth below the undisturbed water-table increases. (C)

Abstract = {{Groundwater contaminant transport is a dispersive process and
   consequently there are limits to what may be learned about a
   contaminant's origins (history) from measurements of its present spatial
   distribution. The extent of these limitations in a particular case
   depends on a number of factors, including the dispersive properties of
   the transport medium, the accuracy of the measured plume, and the
   interval of time over which the plume has evolved, We propose to
   characterize the limitations that will be encountered in a given
   transport medium by performing numerical simulations that assess our
   ability to recover various `test functions', i.e., hypothetical
   contaminant release functions that are designed to provide insight into
   the effect that a transport medium's dispersive properties have on the
   recoverability of a plume history. Knowing our ability to recover test
   functions that differ, for example, in the time span over which the
   release occurs or in the amount of mass released allows us to make
   inferences about our ability to recover the history of an arbitrary
   plume in a transport medium with dispersive properties similar to those
   used in the simulations, Our ability to recover a test function is
   quantified using a Monte Carlo methodology. The method is demonstrated
   for the case of Gaussian test functions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The objective of the investigation of the municipal solid waste
   incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash landfill, Landfill Lostorf, was to
   determine the residence time of water in the landfill and the flow paths
   through the landfill. Over a period of 22 months, measurements of
   rainfall, landfill discharge and leachate electrical conductivity were
   recorded and tracer experiments made. Over the yearly period 1995,
   approximately 50\% of the incident rainfall was measured in the
   discharge. An analysis of single rain events showed that in winter,
   90-100\% of rainfall was expressed in the landfill discharge, whereas in
   summer months, the value was between 9 and 40\% depending on the
   intensity of the rain event. The response to rainfall was rapid. Within
   30-100 h, approximately 50\% of water discharged in response to a rain
   event had left the landfill. The discharge was less' than 4 l/min for
   approximately 50\% of the measurement periods. Qualitative tracer
   studies with fluorescein, pyranine and iodide clearly showed the
   existence of preferential flow paths. This was further substantiated by
   quantitative tracer studies of single rain events using O-18/O-16 ratios
   and electrical conductivity measurements. The proportion of rainwater
   passing directly through the landfill was found to be between 20 and
   80\% in summer months and around 10\% in winter months. The difference
   has been ascribed to the water content in the landfill. The average
   residence time of the water within the landfill has been estimated to be
   roughly 3 years and this water is the predominant component in the
   discharge over a yearly period. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The relative contributions of volatilisation and biodegradation are
   quantified for a field trial of air sparging for the remediation of
   groundwater contaminated with dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons.
   Groundwater in the unconfined sand aquifer at Kwinana in Western
   Australia was grossly contaminated by benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
   xylene (BTEX) and other dissolved organics from spills of gasoline.
   Multi-depth sampling bores, in situ oxygen sensors and neutron access
   tubes were used to determine changes in groundwater chemistry, oxygen
   utilisation and the fate of injected air in the aquifer. Oxygen
   utilisation was used to infer rates of biodegradation. A vadose zone
   soil vapour extraction system was used to quantify the volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) that partitioned from the aqueous phase into the gas
   phase. Volatilisation was found to be the dominant mechanism for the
   removal of dissolved VOCs. This was indicated by the close
   correspondence between calculated masses and the timing of losses. The
   rate of removal was very rapid, with most organics removed within 3 days
   of the start of sparging. The rate of loss was also observed to follow
   the Henry's Law constant for the particular compounds. Estimating
   biodegradation of dissolved petroleum hydrocarbons was complicated by
   other sinks for dissolved O(2), the presence of residual entrapped air
   in the aquifer and bulk movement of groundwater. However, biodegradation
   rates were at least an order of magnitude less than volatilisation rates
   over the period of greatest losses. It was also notable that dissolved
   VOCs were reduced over a larger volume of the aquifer than directly
   contacted by injected air. This may have been due to groundwater
   movement enhanced by stopping and starting sparging during the trial.

Abstract = {{Characterization of phosphorus (P) enriched solids was undertaken in the
   sediments below four mature septic system infiltration beds, where
   previous monitoring of phosphate (PO4) concentrations in the groundwater
   had indicated that substantial retention of P was occurring in the
   vadose zone. At each site, zones of sediment P enrichment were
   identified by an acid extraction procedure. Acid extractable sediment P
   concentrations were found to be 2-5 times higher than background values,
   within narrow discrete zones generally 10-30 cm in thickness, located
   within one meter of the infiltration pipes. Back scattered electron
   images of the P enriched zones indicated that the P solids occurred as
   distinct authigenic grains (up to 300 mu m diameter) and as grain
   coatings. Microprobe analyses indicated predominantly Fe-P in calcareous
   sediments (Cambridge and Langton) and AI-Fe-P in non-calcareous
   sediments (Muskoka and Harp Lake). Porewater analyses indicated that the
   zones of P accumulation were closely associated with zones of redox
   change characterized by the conversion of effluent NH4+ to NO3-. The
   data suggests that a substantial amount of the septic derived P is being
   attenuated by mineral precipitation reactions that occur rapidly after
   the effluent encounters subsurface sediments. Reductive dissolution of
   ferric (oxy)hydroxide minerals as a consequence of reducing environments
   near the infiltrations pipes, the release of Fe2+ in solution and
   subsequent conversion of Fe2+ to Fe3+ may promote the precipitation of
   ferric or ferrosoferric PO4 minerals. In sediments with limited
   buffering capacity (calcite deficient), the decrease in pH resulting
   from effluent oxidation may cause Al (oxy)hydroxide dissolution and
   subsequent precipitation of AI-P rich phases. These precipitation
   reactions appear to have the capacity to immobilize a substantial amount
   of septic derived P (25-99\% at these sites) for a considerable period
   of time. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Gas phase diffusional resistance (D-0/D) was measured using packed soil
   columns containing a fixed relative saturation of dodecane with varying
   moisture contents. Argon was chosen to serve as an inert gas phase
   tracer. Dodecane was used to simulate an immobilized NAPL in the soil
   subsurface. Results indicated that filling of soil pores by either
   liquid water or liquid dodecane has a similar effect on the gas phase
   diffusional resistance. A previously developed diffusion model was
   modified to account for total liquid (water and NAPL) saturation and

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of the solid grain's wettability strongly
   influences the phase-interconnection, phase-flow and solute transport in
   unsaturated porous media. Non-uniform wetting conditions can arise in
   soils and aquifers from natural or anthropogenic impacts. In this study,
   a water-air system in porous media consisting of several types of
   granular materials is considered. A conceptual model for pressure-wise
   estimation of water saturation and relative unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity of such materials is proposed. The model uses the boundary
   water retention curves and corresponding wetting angles of the pure
   components of the mixture as the input parameters. The approach is based
   on simplified statistical and geometrical assumptions for describing the
   mixed porous material and its capillary behavior. In the experimental
   part of this study, three materials with different wetting angles
   (quartz sand, silanized quartz and teflon grains) were used both as pure
   and as homogeneously mixed packings to conduct experiments with a
   water-air system in short columns under well-controlled laboratory
   conditions. The hydraulic characteristics were determined for packings
   with various mixing ratios. The non-uniform matrix wettability was found
   to strongly influence the water retention behavior of the packings,
   whereas its impact on the water-saturation-dependent hydraulic
   conductivity was weak. The measured data are compared to model
   predictions. The results show that the model is capable of providing
   good qualitative estimates of both the boundary water retention curves
   and the curves of the relative hydraulic conductivity for all
   investigated materials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The physical properties of the interfaces between solid, liquid, and
   gaseous phases determine the fate of organic pollutants in soils.
   Choosing butanol as a model substance, we investigated the effects of a
   dissolved organic compound on the relationships between capillary
   pressure, phase saturation, and permeabilities of a quartz sand mixture.
   Steady-state column experiments were performed at various degrees of
   phase saturation using air as the non-wetting phase and aqueous
   solutions with 0\%, 2\% or 6\% (by weight) butanol as the wetting phase.
   The capillary pressure-saturation curves were found to scale according
   to the surface tension ratio. While the saturation curves showed
   considerable hysteresis between wetting and drying with respect to
   capillary pressure, no hysteresis was found in the hydraulic
   permeability curves with respect to saturation and all curves described
   a unique function of saturation. Contrary to hydraulic permeability,
   pneumatic permeability however showed significant hysteresis with
   respect to saturation. The drainage and imbibition branches of the air
   permeability functions were not found to depend on the butanol
   concentration. These results indicate that for a dissolved organic
   compound the effect of concentration on the hydraulic and pneumatic
   characteristics of a soil can be predicted well from a single set of
   capillary pressure-saturation and permeability-saturation curves if the
   corresponding surface tensions are known and if changes of contact
   angles remain small. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Periodically changing boundary conditions influence the water flow at
   the interface of the unsaturated/saturated zone. In this study we
   investigate periodically time-variant lower boundary conditions in a
   one-dimensional soil column with a water table, using numerical
   solutions of Richards equation. The signals used for the simulations are
   triangular and rectangular wave functions as well as a sine function
   with periods ranging from minutes to years and amplitudes of 25, 50, and
   100 cm. The upper boundary was described by a zero or a constant
   downward flux of 0.01 and 1.0 cm d(-1). The hydraulic properties were
   described by the van Genuchten-Mualem model with parameters representing
   soils from the textural classes sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, and loam.
   Water content and pressure head profiles exhibited sharper fronts for
   upward movement of the water table than for downward movement. This also
   resulted in asymmetric variations of matric head and saturation as a
   function of time. By analyzing the simulation results in terms of the
   maximum, minimum, and average height of the water table, we have shown
   that the water table was strongly damped for the upward movement but
   weakly damped for the downward movement. We present a criterion for
   determining the period and amplitude of the boundary condition in which
   the damping of the water table movement is negligible. The unsaturated
   zone above the water table was characterized by the height at which the
   water flow changed from a transient to a steady state. By applying
   scaling {[}Youngs, E.G., 1990. Application of scaling to soil-water

   Publication No. 25, pp. 23-37] and using a macroscopic length scale
   derived from steady unsaturated water flow, we found that the variation
   of the simulation results caused by textural differences was greatly
   reduced. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The transport of water and solutes from the topsoil to groundwater is
   sensitive to the mixing regime near and within the capillary fringe. The
   capillary fringe is the transition zone between the saturated and
   unsaturated regions of the vadose zone. This study was conducted to
   describe variations of water content and matric potential in the
   presence of a capillary fringe. We used a sand column with a fluctuating
   water table to explore the dynamics of the phase distributions. A column
   57 cm in length and 5.3 cm in diameter was packed with a sand mixture.
   The water pressure fluctuated at the bottom and forced the capillary
   fringe to move within the column. The column was installed on a balance
   for measuring the total water mass in it. Water content and potential
   were measured at different soil depths using TDR probes and
   tensiometers. The first series of experiments was conducted without
   irrigating. In a second series water was added to the surface at a
   constant rate by means of a sprinkling system. The variations of water
   content and matric potential were increasingly dampened and shifted in
   time with increasing distance from the capillary fringe. To describe the
   dynamics of water distribution it was necessary to account for
   hysteresis. Hysteresis dampened the water dynamics and caused a highly
   asymmetrical response of water content to the symmetrically oscillating
   lower boundary condition. The water dynamics were simulated with the
   computer code HYSTFLOW {[}Stauffer, F., 1996. Hysterestic unsaturated

Abstract = {{In many field or laboratory situations, well-mixed reservoirs like, for
   instance, injection or detection wells and gas distribution or sampling
   chambers define boundaries of transport domains. Exchange of solutes or
   gases across such boundaries can occur through advective or diffusive
   processes. First we analyzed situations, where the inlet region consists
   of a well-mixed reservoir, in a systematic way by interpreting them in
   terms of injection type. Second, we discussed the mass balance errors
   that seem to appear in case of resident injections. Mixing cells (MC)
   can be coupled mathematically in different ways to a domain where
   advective-dispersive transport occurs: by assuming a continuous solute
   flux at the interface (flux injection, MC-FI), or by assuming a
   continuous resident concentration (resident injection). In the latter
   case, the flux leaving the mixing cell can be defined in two ways:
   either as the value when the interface is approached from the
   mixing-cell side (MC-RT -), or as the value when it is approached from
   the column side (MC-RT +). Solutions of these injection types with
   constant or-in one case-distance-dependent transport parameters were
   compared to each other as well as to a solution of a two-layer system,
   where the first layer was characterized by a large dispersion
   coefficient. These solutions differ mainly at small Peclet numbers. For
   most real situations, the model for resident injection MC-RI + is
   considered to be relevant. This type of injection was modeled with a
   constant or with an exponentially varying dispersion coefficient within
   the porous medium. A constant dispersion coefficient will be appropriate
   for gases because of the Eulerian nature of the usually dominating
   gaseous diffusion coefficient, whereas the asymptotically growing
   dispersion coefficient will be more appropriate for solutes due to the
   Lagrangian nature of mechanical dispersion, which evolves only with the
   fluid flow. Assuming a continuous resident concentration at the
   interface between a mixing cell and a column, as in case of the MC-RI +
   model, entails a flux discontinuity. This flux discontinuity arises
   inherently from the definition of a mixing cell: the mixing process is
   included in the balance equation, but does not appear in the description
   of the flux through the mixing cell. There, only convection appears
   because of the homogeneous concentration within the mixing cell. Thus,
   the solute flux through a mixing cell in close contact with a transport
   domain is generally underestimated. This leads to (apparent) mass
   balance errors, which are often reported for similar situations and
   erroneously used to judge the validity of such models. Finally, the
   mixing cell model MC-RI + defines a universal basis regarding the type
   of solute injection at a boundary. Depending on the mixing cell
   parameters, it represents, in its limits, flux as well as resident
   injections. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In soils advective gas flow may be due to natural processes, e.g.,
   water-table fluctuations, or may be a result of remediation techniques,
   such as soil vapor extraction (SVE), which are used to remove volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs) from the vadose zone. Recently, multicomponent
   experiments as well as numerical simulations provided evidence that the
   efficiency of SVE operations can be limited by slow diffusion of VOCs
   from interparticle water into the gas phase. Using a first-order
   kinetics approach, we show that the degree of local nonequilibrium
   between the two phases and, thus, of the validity of the local
   equilibrium assumption (LEA) can be characterized by the prefix
   denominator, P-D, for gas-water mass transfer which is derived by the
   SKIT (Separation of the Kinetically Influenced Term) procedure of Bahr
   and Rubin {[}Bahr, J.M., Rubin, J., 1987. Direct comparison of kinetic
   and local equilibrium formulations for solute transport affected by
   surface reactions. Water Resour. Res. 23(3), 438-452]. Values of the
   prefix denominator smaller than 1 indicated nonequilibrium between the
   two phases while P-D-values of 10 or larger indicated local equilibrium
   between aqueous and gaseous VOC concentrations. These findings can be
   used to optimize field applications of soil vapor extraction (SVE). (C)

Abstract = {{Bacterial mobility in unsaturated soils plays an important role in
   bioremediation, biofacilitated transport of pollutants, and dispersal of
   pathogenic microorganisms. A sand column equipped with ports for
   measuring water pressure and water saturation has been used to study
   bacterial transport under well-defined unsaturated flow conditions.
   Bacterial breakthrough curves at various water saturations were obtained
   for two soil bacteria. Retention of hydrophobic Rhodococcus sp. C125 and
   mesohydrophilic Pseudomonas putida mt2 was markedly increased at lower
   water saturation. A mechanistic model for bacterial transport under
   unsaturated conditions is proposed. The model attributes stronger
   bacterial retention under unsaturated conditions to the accumulation of
   bacteria at the air-water interface. Moreover, the model takes into
   account changes in the available surface areas of both the solid surface
   and the air-water interface due to coverage by bacteria and changes in
   the water flow. Application of the model to our own data and data from
   the Literature showed that short-term breakthrough experiments can be
   simulated, but that the model deviates from experimental observation in
   long-term experiments. Reasons for this deviation are discussed, and
   suggestions for a further model extension are made. All investigated
   colloidal particles had a higher affinity to the air-water interface
   than to the solid surface. Therefore, trapping of bacteria by air-water
   interfaces is an important process possibly controlling bacterial
   transport in unsaturated soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Supercritical fluid extraction with CO2 was applied to the analysis of
   traces of pendimethalin, a herbicide of the dinitroanilines group, in
   four different natural soils. The Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE)
   method was compared with the classical Soxhlet and shaking methods in
   terms of ease to run, extraction efficiency, selectivity and
   reproducibility. The influence of the physico-chemical properties of the
   soil matrix on herbicide extraction was then evaluated with the SFE
   method. The supercritical fluid extraction system used in the present
   study was found to be much easier to run than the other two methods,
   less time consuming and requires fewer operations as it was optimized
   for on-line sample clean up. SFE is the most selective of the three
   tested methods as fewer co-extracts are obtained in the final samples.
   SFE with CO2 is particularly powerful because pendimethalin is highly
   hydrophobic. However, this makes pendimethalin a poor choice for a
   selectivity study of SFE as it is very rapidly extracted at any CO2
   density. Pendimethalin extraction with supercritical CO2 was found to be
   almost complete with average recoveries of 96-99\%, similarly to Soxhlet
   but with a much lower standard deviation (8-10\%). The performance of
   SFE was shown to be unaffected by soil parameters except soil water
   content. It is demonstrated indeed that extraction efficiency is not
   linearly related to soil water content, and optimal recovery was found
   for water contents ranging from 2 to 15\% depending on the type of soil.
   Soil water increases extraction efficiency because water acts as a
   modifier of the supercritical fluid and increases the penetration of the
   fluid inside the soil particles (clay swelling). In contrast to SFE and
   Soxhlet, the efficiency of the shaking method appeared to be partial and
   strongly dependent on soil properties. Although initial developments
   should be needed, the various benefits of SFE-CO2 make this method
   attractive compared to traditional methods. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on sorption and degradation processes
   involved in the fate of nitroaromatic herbicides in an alluvial sandy
   loam. Particular attention was given to a competitive sorption process
   and its impact on herbicide biodegradation through bioavailability
   modification. The main question addressed was the occurrence of
   antagonistic or synergistic effects in herbicide mixtures. Approaching
   the problem by using a herbicide combination, it was demonstrated that
   the more soluble herbicides strongly decreased the sorption of the more
   hydrophobic ones on the soil organic fraction. Conversely, ionic
   strength was shown to increase sorption levels dramatically. These
   results prove that soil solution chemistry is a relevant factor to be
   taken into account in pesticide behaviour studies. Herbicide
   biodegradation was studied with the same approach, and the results
   revealed that degradation of a particular dinitrophenol is affected by
   the presence of similar molecules. In well-dispersed soil suspensions
   where herbicide/micro-organism contact is optimal, toxicity was shown to
   increase herbicide persistence and to be the controlling factor of
   biodegradation. Conversely, persistence in repacked unsaturated soil
   batches was strongly decreased in both mono and multi-solute systems. In
   such solid batches, the soil structure imposed mass transfer kinetics
   which modify micro-organism/herbicide contact and decreased toxicity
   effects. Furthermore, the competitive sorption observed in multi-solute
   systems was supposed to be responsible for the observed increase of
   herbicide biodegradation presumably by keeping molecules bioavailable
   for microbial attack. These results support the assumption that soils
   are divided into two compartments presenting different capacities in
   regard to chemical sorption and biodegradation, which could be a basis
   for explaining chemical aging in soil. This study providing new
   information on physico-chemical control of pollutant biodegradation in
   soils, contributes to the understanding of the reasons for chemical
   persistence and mobility, and opens some perspectives to improvements of
   soil bioremediation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The water content of porous media may substantially affect the transport
   behaviour of conservative and sorbing solutes. Physical processes
   potentially involved include alterations of the flow velocities, flow
   patterns, or of accessible surface sites. We performed column
   experiments using a synthetic porous medium, in which a substantial part
   of the sorption sites was concentrated in regions within small grained
   aggregates that were accessible only by diffusion, a feature often found
   in natural soils and sediments. We investigated the transport of solutes
   exhibiting very different sorption characteristics under steady state
   conditions at different water contents of the porous medium. The tracers
   used were either nonreactive, partitioned into organic matter or sorbed
   specifically and nonlinearly to clay minerals. Hydrodynamic dispersion
   generally increased with decreasing water content, reflected by the
   breakthrough curves (BTCs) of conservative and only slightly sorbing
   tracers, which exhibited stronger spreading and early breakthrough of
   the fronts at lower water saturation. Nonlinear sorption and
   nonequilibrium mass transfer between the mobile region and the immobile
   water present within the aggregates dominated the BTCs of the strongly
   sorbing tracer at all degrees of water saturation, and, thus, rendered
   the effects of increased hydrodynamic dispersion negligible. Due to a
   relative increase in the ratio of sorption sites per water volume, the
   retardation of this tracer distinctly increased at low water contents of
   the porous medium. Solute transport of all tracers was successfully
   simulated with an advective-dispersive transport model that considered
   the respective sorption behaviour and retarded intra-aggregate diffusion
   as predominant processes. All parameter values of the model had been
   determined previously in independent experiments under completely
   saturated conditions. Our results demonstrate that a well parameterised
   transport model that was calibrated under completely saturated
   conditions was able to describe rate-limited advective-dispersive
   transport of reactive solutes also under unsaturated steady-state
   conditions. Enhanced relative retardation of strongly sorbing compounds
   under such conditions is likely to affect biological and chemical
   transformation processes of these compounds. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The development of the redox conditions has been studied in an initially
   aerobic column filled with quartz sand coated with ferrihydrite and
   subjected to a fluctuating water table. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the effect of water table fluctuations on the redox dynamics
   and the fate of selected organic pollutants. The column that was
   percolated continuously with electron accepters (O-2, NO3, SO4) and
   electron donors (acetate and formate), was first operated under
   saturated conditions resulting in the classical redox zonation. After 4
   months of operation, we started to fluctuate the water level and three
   drainage-imbibition cycles were run each with a total cycle length of 1
   month. The pulse of oxygen introduced by lowering the water table caused
   a partial and temporal oxidation of previously reduced species. To
   investigate the effect of the changing redox environment on the
   transport and transformation of organic pollutants, breakthrough
   experiments were performed with 4-nitrobenzoate and toluene as model
   pollutants representative for nitro-substituted and volatile aromatics,
   respectively. The fate of 4-nitrobenzoate and toluene was studied under
   saturated conditions in short pulse breakthrough experiments and
   evaluated using the advection-dispersion model. 4-nitrobenzoate was
   transformed stoichiometrically into 4-aminobenzoate caused by the
   reduction of the nitrogroup. The transformation rate varied with depth
   and with time, dropping from 15.3 nmol g(-1) h(-1) after the first
   drainage-imbibition cycle to 1.5 nmol g(-1) h(-1) after 4 additional
   months of operation. Toluene was not degraded during the first
   breakthrough experiment and showed a retardation factor of 2.06 which
   was ascribed to diffusion into entrapped air, originating from
   drainage-imbibition cycles, and to sorption to biomass. After the 24-h
   pre-exposure to toluene, adaptation had occurred and in later
   experiments toluene was degraded within the first 6 cm. These data show
   that in an experiment that was well-described in terms of water flow,
   gas flow, and initial mineral phase composition, the microbial processes
   induced a chemical and physical heterogeneity. An additional
   heterogeneity in space and time was introduced by the fluctuating water
   table. The `history' of the column had consequences for the fate of
   organic pollutants and resulted in an unpredictable behaviour with
   respect to their transformation, transport and degradation. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Water flow and solute transport in a fractured medium are described by
   the Channel Network model, CHAN3D. In the field and in the model, most
   of the flow and transport take place in fracture zones. CHAN3D was used
   to simulate a long-term pumping and tracer test called LPT2. In the
   first simulations, no calibrations, conditioning or parameter
   adjustments were made to better fit the experimental results. Instead,
   as much as possible of the available field data were used. In six
   different paths the simulations predicted breakthrough that should be
   observable. However, only two of the performed tracer tests resulted in
   breakthrough of solutes. Some possible reasons for the scant recovery is
   discussed. In the analysis of LPT2, the impact of the flow rates at the
   injection positions, flow porosity and interaction with the rock matrix
   were studied. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vadose zone description of multi-fluid flow requires measurement
   techniques capable of determining the capillary pressure and
   permeability functions of multi-fluid soil systems. Multi-step outflow
   experiments are presented that use a modified Tempe cell for air-water,
   oil (Soltrol)-water, and air-oil fluid pairs in Columbia fine sandy loam
   and a Lincoln sandy loam. In addition to measurements of cumulative
   outflow and wetting fluid pressure in outflow experiments of air
   displacing water or oil, pressure changes of the oil (non-wetting fluid)
   were measured in oil-water experiments. Results from the multi-step
   measurements were successfully used to directly estimate capillary
   pressure-saturation and wetting fluid permeability functions. The
   capillary pressure saturation data for each fluid pair were scaled using
   their interfacial tension values relative to that of air-water, thereby
   yielding a combined capillary pressure-saturation curve for the three
   measured fluid pairs. The combined relative permeability data for both
   soils nearly coalesce to a single curve, indicating that the relative
   permeability is solely a function of the porous medium properties.
   Furthermore, the directly estimated permeability data agreed well with
   permeability functions obtained using a parameter estimation approach,
   by which parameters were optimized from comparison of observed and
   numerically-simulated values of capillary pressure and cumulative
   outflow. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The retardation factor describes the average velocity of a sorbing
   contaminant in groundwater relative to the average velocity of
   groundwater. The modified retardation factor (R' or R{*}) describes the
   average velocity of a sorbing contaminant relative to groundwater in the
   presence of a carrier that binds the contaminant and facilitates its
   transport. Dissolved organic matter and particulate colloids are
   examples of potential facilitating carriers. The modified retardation
   factor R' concerns the case when sorption of the carrier itself to the
   stationary phase is negligible, whereas R{*} accounts for significant
   sorption of a facilitating carrier to the stationary phase, and so
   represents a magnitude less than R, but greater than R'. A well-cited
   expression for R{*} is shown to differ in form and behavior relative to
   a lesser known expression for R{*}, and the bounds of applicability of
   these expressions are examined. The lesser-known expression for R{*} is
   shown to be more broadly applicable in its ability to describe
   situations where carrier sorption to the stationary phase is
   significant, and even rivals or exceeds that of the contaminant. The
   well-known expression for R{*} is shown to be not applicable to
   situations involving significant sorption of the carrier. The derivation
   of the expression for R{*} presented in this paper is given by two
   separate methods used to develop the previously published expressions,
   in order to relate the presented and previously published expression to
   each other. The expression is extended to include non-linear contaminant
   sorption to the stationary phase, and predictions from this expression
   are compared to a set of experimental data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Groundwater provides about 30\% of water requirements in Ontario, but
   farm families depend almost entirely on private wells. Major potential
   contaminants on farms are nitrate (NO3-), pathogenic microorganisms,
   pesticides and petroleum derivatives. A survey of farm drinking-water
   wells was conducted throughout the Province of Ontario, Canada, in 1991
   and 1992 and tested for these contaminants. The main objectives of the
   survey were to determine the quality and safety of drinking water for
   farm families, and determine the effect of agricultural management on
   groundwater quality at a provincial scale. Four farm wells were chosen
   in each township where > 50\% of the land area was used for agricultural
   production. Elsewhere one well per township was usually sampled. Within
   each township the types of farming activity and dominant soils were
   additional criteria for selection. The network comprised 1292 of the
   estimated 500,000 water-wells in Ontario, and the study conformed to a
   stratified random survey. A subset of 160 wells, chosen by farm type,
   soil, and the presence or absence of a fuel storage tank, was
   investigated for the presence of petroleum derivatives: benzene,
   toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene. About 40\% of farm wells tested
   contained one or more of the target contaminants above the maximum
   acceptable concentration; 34\% of wells had more than the maximum
   acceptable number of coliform bacteria, 14\% contained NO3--N
   concentrations above 10 mg l(-1) limit and about 7\% were contaminated
   with both bacteria and NO3-. Only six wells contained pesticide residues
   above the interim maximum acceptable concentration (IMAC), but
   pesticides were detected in 7\% of wells in winter and in 11\% in
   summer. No wells contained detectable petroleum derivatives. These
   results for NO3- contamination were not significantly different from
   those reported for a survey of Ontario wells for the period 1950-1954,
   but the frequency of contamination by Escherichia coli was greater in
   the present study. None of the point sources investigated contributed
   significantly to the NO3- contamination. The percentage of wells
   contaminated by coliform bacteria decreased significantly with
   increasing separation of the well from the feedlot or exercise yard on
   livestock farms. A full statistical model including the type of well
   construction, depth, age and soil hydrologic group was developed to
   describe the frequency of NO3- contamination. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Multilevel monitoring wells (MLWs) were installed at 144 farms which
   were part of a province-wide survey of farm drinking water wells
   conducted in 1991-1992 in Ontario, Canada. The multilevel sites were
   selected in areas characterized by coarse-textured soils, on farms
   typifying local agricultural enterprises. The MLWs were installed in
   cultivated fields adjacent to the location of the drinking water wells
   on each farm (within 200 m). On 16 of these farms, MLWs were also
   installed in a woodlot adjacent to the field site. Water samples were
   collected on two occasions (winter and summer) and analyses were
   conducted for nitrate (NO3-), typical bacteria and a selected suite of
   common pesticides. At 23\% of the sites, concentrations in 50\% or more
   of the monitored intervals exceeded the provincial drinking water
   standard (MAC) for NO3--N during both sampling periods. Significantly
   higher frequencies of total coliform contamination were encountered in
   the winter (66\%) than in the summer (36\%). Very few pesticide
   detections were recorded. The average concentration of NO3- with depth
   in multilevel wells decreased from approximately 10 mg N l(-1) near the
   water table to 3 mg N l(-1) at a depth of about 6.5 m. Bacteria
   concentrations remained more uniform with depth but decreased
   significantly in the summer. For most analytes, contaminant frequency
   was similar for both the drinking water wells and multilevel wells. The
   occurrence of elevated levels of contamination in the water wells
   appeared to be associated more with activities on the cultivated fields
   than with on-farm point sources of contamination. Groundwater quality
   determined using drinking water wells was consistent with conclusions
   drawn from multilevel monitoring wells, indicating the utility of water
   well survey data for assessing groundwater quality within the rural
   environment. No correlations were observed between the type of cropping
   practice and the frequency of groundwater contamination. Farms where
   manure spreading occurred, however, had significantly higher occurrences
   of contamination from NO3- and bacteria than farms where manure was not
   applied along with commercial N-fertilizer. The uncultivated conditions
   beneath the woodlot areas appeared to provide an environment conducive
   to attenuation of nitrate but not bacteria. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Transport of reactive colloids in groundwater may enhance the transport
   of contaminants in groundwater. Often, the interpretation of results of
   transport experiments is not a simple task as both reactions of colloids
   with the solid matrix and reactions of contaminants with the solid
   matrix and mobile and immobile colloids may be time dependent and
   nonlinear. Further colloid transport properties may differ from solute
   transport properties. In this paper, a one-dimensional model for coupled
   colloid and contaminant transport in a porous medium (COLTRAP) is
   presented together with simulation results. Calculated breakthrough
   curves (BTC's) during contamination and decontamination show
   systematically the effect of nonlinear and kinetic interactions on
   contaminant transport in the presence of reactive colloids, and the
   effect of colloid transport properties that differ from solute transport
   properties. It is shown that in case of linear kinetic reactions, the
   rate of exchange of mobile and immobile colloids have a large impact on
   the shape of BTC's even if the solid matrix is saturated with respect to
   colloids. BTC's during the contamination and decontamination phase have
   identical shapes in this case. Moreover, the slow reactions of
   contaminants and colloids may lead to unretarded breakthrough of
   contaminants. Independent of reaction rates, nonlinear reactions lead to
   BTC's that are steeper during contamination than in the linear case. A
   characteristic aspect of nonlinear sorption is that shapes of BTC's
   differ during the contamination and decontamination phase. It has been
   observed that shapes of some of the simulated adsorption and desorption
   curves are similar as shapes found in experiments reported in
   literature. This stresses the importance of incorporating both kinetics
   and nonlinearity in models for coupled colloid and contaminant transport
   and the capability of COLTRAP to interpret experimental results.
   Finally, to figure out whether nonlinear processes play a role, it is
   very important to consider both contamination and decontamination in
   transport experiments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent work has demonstrated the utility of reactive barriers for
   transformation or immobilization of contaminants in ground water.
   However, reaction-induced changes in hydraulic conductivity may
   Compromise the reactive barrier by diverting flow or focusing
   breakthrough of contaminants. For an acidic, ferric solution flowing
   through calcareous sand in column experiments, we investigated how
   hydraulic-conductivity reduction, reaction-front propagation, and
   fingering depend upon the reactive solid volume, reactive surface area,
   and pore-water velocity. Hydraulic-conductivity reductions are greater
   with larger initial pore-water velocity, calcite surface area, or
   calcite volume. Reductions in hydraulic conductivity (up to four orders
   of magnitude) result primarily from CO2 (g) exsolution rather than from
   ferric oxyhydroxide precipitation and may be at least partly reversed as
   bubbles migrate. Although fingering is both driven and repressed by
   pore-scale hydraulic changes, the velocity of the reaction front, width
   of the primary reaction zone, and maximum length of the largest finger
   appear to be insensitive to macroscopic changes in hydraulic
   conductivity at a constant flow rate. Reaction-front velocity increases
   as the ratio of initial calcite volume to pore-water velocity decreases,
   whereas zonal width and maximum finger length appear to increase as the
   Damkohler number decreases for a given calcite grain-size distribution.
   These results offer guidelines for improving the efficiency of reactive
   barriers when the reaction rate equals or exceeds the rate of mass
   transfer. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a basic study in generalized terms that originates
   from two needs: (1) to understand the major mechanisms involved in the
   mineralization of groundwater of the Great Bend Prairie aquifer of
   Kansas by saltwater originating from a deeper Permian bedrock formation,
   and (2) to develop simple, robust tools that can readily be used for
   local assessment and management activities in the salt-affected region.
   A simplified basic conceptual model is adopted, incorporating two
   horizontal layers of porous medium which come into contact at a specific
   location within the model domain. The top layer is saturated with
   freshwater, and the bottom layer is saturated with saltwater. The paper
   considers various stages of approximation which can be useful for
   simplified simulation of the build-up of the transition zone (TZ)
   between the freshwater and the saltwater. The hierarchy of approximate
   approaches leads to the development of the top specified boundary layer
   (TSBL) method, which is the major tool used in this study for initial
   characterization of the development of the TZ. It is shown that the
   thickness of the TZ is mainly determined by the characteristic
   dispersivity. The build-up of the TZ is completed after a time period
   equal to the time needed to advect a fluid particle along the whole
   extent of the TZ. Potential applications and the effects of natural
   recharge and pumpage on salinity transport in the domain are discussed
   and evaluated in the context of demonstrating the practicality of the
   TSBL approach. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a generalized basic study that addresses practical
   needs for an understanding of the major mechanisms involved in the
   mineralization of groundwater in the Great Bend Prairie aquifer in
   south-central Kansas. This Quaternary alluvial aquifer and associated
   surface waters are subject to contamination by saltwater, which in some
   areas seeps from the deeper Permian bedrock formation into the overlying
   freshwater aquifer through semiconfining layers. A simplified conceptual
   model is adopted. It incorporates the freshwater aquifer whose bottom is
   comprised of a semiconfining layer through which a hydrologically minor
   but geochemically important saline water discharge seeps into the
   aquifer. A hierarchy of approximate approaches is considered to analyze
   the mineralization processes taking place in the aquifer. The recently
   developed top specified boundary layer (TSBL) approach is very
   convenient to use for the initial characterization of these processes,
   and is further adapted to characterization of head-driven seepage
   through semi-confining layers. TSBL calculations indicate that the
   seeping saline water may create two distinct new zones in the aquifer:
   (1) a completely saline zone (CSZ) adjacent to the semiconfining bottom
   of the aquifer, and (2) a transition zone (TZ) which develops between
   the CSZ and the freshwater zone. Some possible scenarios associated with
   the various mineralization patterns are analyzed and discussed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The movement of light nonaqueous-phase liquids (LNAPLs) in heterogeneous
   vadose environments is not fully understood. We investigated LNAPL
   movement near sloping fine-over-coarse-grained textural interfaces,
   forming capillary barriers. Flow experiments were conducted in a glass
   chamber (50 X 60 x 1.0 cm) using two uniform silica sands (12/20 and
   30/40 sieve sizes). LNAPL (Soltrol(R) 220) was released at the sand
   surface during constant water irrigation and visible light transmission
   was used to observe LNAPL and water flow paths. LNAPL movement strongly
   depended on the water saturation in the fine-grained sand layer above
   the textural interface. At low water saturation, LNAPL was fully
   diverted along the interface, whereas at moderate water saturation
   partial penetration of the LNAPL into the coarse-grained sand layer was
   observed. At high water saturation, LNAPL was fully diverted parallel to
   the interface, supported on the zone of high water saturation.
   Additional hysteretic effects on LNAPL movement were observed at high
   water saturation. The results demonstrate the critical role water
   saturation plays in determining LNAPL disposition in a heterogeneous
   vadose zone. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   of deterministic pesticide leaching models (Monte-Carlo), along with
   geostatistical interpolation techniques, were used to map both
   vulnerability levels and uncertainties. The various tested leaching
   models (numerical and analytical solutions of the convection-dispersion

   show very high vulnerabilities. However, uncertainties are large,
   ranging from 20-30\% for vulnerability indices between 0 and 1.
   Variations in pesticide properties (40-50\%), water table depth

   SO42- and CO2 as externally supplied oxidants. After 31 days of column
   operation, stable concentration profiles were found for most of the
   measured dissolved species. Within 14 h residence time, about 0.24 mM
   SO42- were consumed and dissolved Fe(II) (up to 0.012 mM), Mn(II) (up to
   0.06 mM), and CH4 (up to 0.38 mM) were produced. The alkalinity and the
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration increased and the DIC
   became enriched in C-13. In the column, n-alkanes were selectively
   removed while branched alkanes persisted, suggesting a biological
   degradation. Furthermore, based on changes of concentrations of aromatic
   compounds with similar physical-chemical properties in the effluent, it
   was concluded that toluene, p-xylene and naphthalene were degraded. A
   carbon mass balance revealed that 65\% of the hydrocarbons removed from
   the column were recovered as DIG, 20\% were recovered as CH4, and 15\%
   were eluted from the column. The calculations indicated that hydrocarbon
   mineralization coupled to SO42- reduction and methanogenesis contributed
   in equal proportions to the hydrocarbon removal. Hydrocarbon
   mineralization coupled to Fe(III) and Mn(IV) reduction was of minor
   importance. DIG, alkalinity, and stable carbon isotope balances were
   shown to be a useful tool to verify hydrocarbon mineralization. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A mixed-integer programming model to determine the optimum number of
   wells, their locations and pumping rates for soil vapor extraction (SVE)
   is developed by coupling an air flow simulation model (AIR3D) to the
   GAMS optimization software. The model was tested for sensitivity of the
   vertical discretization of the domain, the number of potential well
   locations, the number of constraints, and the screen length of the
   wells. It was shown that these variables affected the optimal solution.
   It was also shown that the installation costs of the wells in the model
   influenced the optimal design. This was demonstrated by comparing the
   results of the mixed-integer programming model to a linear programming
   model in which the installation costs of the wells were neglected. The
   mixed-integer programming model could be useful in the design process in
   cases of short remediation times when the installation costs of wells
   could be significant. Numerous test cases with results are presented to
   demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the model. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Analysis of water flow and transport of one conservative (Bromide) and
   two reactive {[}Bromacil (BMC) and Terbuthylazine (TBA)] solutes in a
   field experiment at Bet Dagan site, Israel is carried out. The study is
   based on the early developed column model of flow and transport in
   unsaturated soil which is expanded here to incorporate the
   redistribution stage. The transport of reactive solute is modeled by
   assuming three mechanisms: advection by water flow, equilibrium sorption
   and linear decay. The solutions of flow and transport equations are
   derived for a infiltration-redistribution cycle and averaged further by
   regarding the soil properties (saturated conductivity, saturated and
   residual water contents) and the rate of water application by
   irrigation,on the soil surface as independent random values. The most
   extensive experimental data are concentration measurements in 20
   vertical profiles at a few depths and times. These data are used in
   order to evaluate the spatially averaged concentration as function of
   time and depth. Flow parameters are identified by a best fit between the
   model and measured mean concentration of the conservative solute. The
   same procedure is used to identify the reactive properties (partition
   coefficient, half life) of the reactive solutes. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The bacterial consumption of chelating agents that are present in
   low-level radioactive and mixed wastes may help to immobilize chelated
   metals and radionuclides accidentally released to groundwater. We
   investigated the influence of the bacterial consumption of citrate
   complexed with cobalt on cobalt transport through packed sand columns.
   Experiments were conducted using each of three types of column packing
   material using minerals common to subsurface environments: clean quartz
   sand; ferric oxide (Fe(OH)(3))-coated sand; hausmannite (Mn3O4)-coated
   sand. Separate control column experiments were conducted to examine
   citrate's influence on cobalt transport without the bacterial
   consumption of citrate. The bacterial community consumed all the
   citrate; the pore water pH decreased by up to one unit before reaching a
   steady-state value of 6.9-7.1, which was lower than the influent pH
   (7.4). These results were in contrast to open batch experiments
   conducted with the same culture, where the pH increased by more than one
   unit. The dissolved oxygen exhibited similar dynamics, reaching a
   steady-state value of 3-4 mg/l, well below the influent value of 7.5
   mg/l. The dynamics in pore water pH and dissolved oxygen were associated
   with the presence of the bacterial community because these parameters
   remained steady in control experiments in which the bacteria were not
   included. Cobalt transport was most rapid for the columns packed with
   quartz sand followed by the Fe-coated sand and finally the Mn-coated
   sand. Most of the cobalt retained by the quartz sand and Fe-coated sand
   was easily exchanged with Mg2+ whereas most of the cobalt retained by
   the Mn-coated sand required an acetic acid solution for its removal. The
   bacterially mediated pH decrease, driven by the consumption of citrate,
   decreased cobalt sorption to the solid phase resulting in enhanced
   cobalt transport. The results of these experiments suggest that
   geochemical changes, driven by the bacterial consumption of citrate,
   enhanced cobalt transport although the complexing ligand had been
   removed from the system. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. ALI rights

Abstract = {{Tailing phenomena observed during the dissolution of binary oil mixtures
   are manifestations of non-equilibrium effects and are not induced by
   non-ideal partitioning. This conclusion follows a
   thermodynamically-based analysis of the dissolution process in a
   chromatographic framework. A criterion, both components of binary oil
   mixtures having enhanced or unaffected solubilities relative to Raoult's
   law, serves as an indicator for systems in which non-linear-partitioning
   induced tailing is precluded; tailing must be the result of
   non-equilibrium processes. This condition is the rule, since chemical
   dissimilarities tend to increase activity coefficients in mixtures. (C)

Title = {{Three-dimensional plume source reconstruction using minimum relative

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend the minimum relative entropy (MRE) method to
   recover the source-release history of a three dimensional plume. This
   extension is carried out in an analytic framework, and in order to
   qualify as a Linear inverse problem the various transport parameters
   such as dispersivity and the like are considered to be known. In
   addition, the groundwater flow system is assumed to be steady and
   uniform. The contributions of this paper include an explanation how MRE
   can be used as a measure of resolution in linear inversion, a reporting
   of a three dimensional analytic solution for mass transport in a steady
   one dimensional velocity field for a variable in-time source loading, an
   estimation the source-release history for synthetically generated data
   sets, and an application of the methodology to a case-study problem at
   the Gloucester Landfill in Ontario, Canada. We found that the relative
   entropy measure is useful in indicating the reduction in uncertainty
   between the posterior and prior pdfs as a result of the new information
   provided by the physical constraints and data. Using the individual
   model-parameter relative entropies as a measure of resolution, one can
   make quantitative judgments about which part of the history is likely to
   be well resolved. Comparing inversion results for synthetic aquifers
   with one well and two sample points with only one sample point indicates
   that temporal data at several wells allows for a superior reconstruction
   of the release history. We investigate the potential benefits of
   locating sample points on an spatial rather than temporal basis. Results
   show that early part of the release history is poorly recovered.
   Comparing these results with one well and two sample points indicates
   that temporal data at a few wells allows for a better reconstruction of
   the release history. An incomplete time record is also investigated.
   Results show that early part of the release history prior to the
   commencement of measurements is poorly recovered. It is essential that
   as much as possible of the time histories of plumes be monitored if the
   entire release history is to be determined. The MRE approach is used to
   reconstruct the release history of a I,4-dioxane plume measured at the
   Gloucester Landfill in Ontario, Canada. The recovered release history is
   fairly narrow and generally flat in shape, although two peaks are
   evident. Neither peak is particularly well defined, judging from the
   resolution curve and analysis of the confidence ranges. One of the peaks
   coincides with year 1979. close to the year 1978 in which a large spill
   was noted. However, a considerable variation of possible source releases
   is possible. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The natural gas sweetening chemicals, sulfolane and diisopropanolamine
   (DIPA), are highly water soluble and have leached into the ground water
   from landfills and spills at some sour gas processing plant sites in
   western Canada. This paper reports on the results of batch equilibration
   studies designed to evaluate sulfolane and DTPA sorption parameters,
   which are of relevance to modeling fate and behavior of these compounds
   in the saturated zone. The sorbents included aquifer materials from
   three plant sites, reference montmorillonite and kaolinite, and six
   soils of various clay and organic matter contents. The DIPA sorption
   isotherms were curvilinear, the slope decreasing with increasing
   concentration. DIPA adsorption by montmorillonite decreased as the
   solution concentration of K2SO4 increased, consistent with a
   cation-exchange reaction. A decrease in pH from 8.3 to 6.8 produced a
   slight increase in DIPA adsorption by montmorillonite. X-ray analysis of
   DIPA-saturated montmorillonite showed that DIPA enters the interlayer
   space of the mineral. The sulfolane sorption isotherms were linear and
   sulfolane sorption by the aquifer materials was very low (K-d < 1 l/kg),
   whereas DIPA uptake was somewhat higher (K-d < 4 l/kg). Both compounds
   were sorbed more by clay minerals than by organic matter and cation
   exchange capacity was a reasonable predictor of the sorption of
   sulfolane and DIPA by soils and aquifer materials with low contents of
   organic C (<1 g/100 g). DIPA desorption from montmorillonite was low
   relative to adsorption, and some hysteresis was found for some aquifer
   materials in the desorption of DIPA. Based on estimates of retardation,
   sulfolane was predicted to move farther than DIPA under the conditions
   at plant sites. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. AII rights reserved.}},

   solute transport in heterogeneous porous media under saturated flow
   conditions is applied to the prediction of conservative nonreactive
   solute transport in the vadose zone where observations are obtained by
   soil coring. Exact analytical solutions are developed for both the mean
   and variance of solute concentrations measured in discrete soil cores
   using a simplified physical model for vadose-zone flow and solute
   transport. Theoretical results show that while the ensemble mean
   concentration is relatively insensitive to the length-scale of the
   measurement, predictions of the concentration variance are significantly
   impacted by the sampling interval. Results also show that accounting for
   vertical heterogeneity in the soil profile results in significantly less
   spreading in the mean and variance of the measured solute breakthrough
   curves, indicating that it is important to account for vertical
   heterogeneity even for relatively small travel distances. Model
   predictions for both the mean and variance of locally measured solute
   concentration, based on independently estimated model parameters, agree
   well with data from a field tracer test conducted in Manatee County,
   Florida. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In situ flushing groundwater remediation technologies, such as cosolvent
   flushing, rely on the stability of the interface between the resident
   and displacing fluids for efficient removal of contaminants. Contrasts
   in density and viscosity between the resident and displacing fluids can
   adversely affect the stability of the displacement front. Petroleum
   engineers have developed techniques to describe these types of
   processes; however, their findings do not necessarily translate directly
   to aquifer remediation. The purpose of this laboratory study was to
   investigate how density and viscosity contrasts affected cosolvent
   displacements in unconfined porous media characterized by the presence
   of a capillary fringe. Two-dimensional flow laboratory experiments,
   which were partially scaled to a cosolvent flushing field experiment,
   were conducted to determine potential implications of flow instabilities
   in homogeneous sand packs. Numerical simulations were also conducted to
   investigate the differential impact of fluid property contrasts in
   unconfined and confined systems. The results from these experiments and
   simulations indicated that the presence of a capillary fringe was an
   important factor in the displacement efficiency. Buoyant forces can act
   to carry a Lighter-than-water cosolvent preferentially into the
   capillary fringe during displacement of the resident groundwater. During
   subsequent water flooding, buoyancy forces can act to effectively trap
   the cosolvent in the capillary fringe, contributing to the inefficient
   removal of cosolvent from the aquifer. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Multiphase flow in porous media is an important research topic. In situ,
   nondestructive experimental methods for studying multiphase flow are
   important for improving our understanding and the theory. Rapid changes
   in fluid saturation, characteristic of immiscible displacement, are
   difficult to measure accurately using gamma rays due to practical
   restrictions on source strength. Our objective is to describe a
   synchrotron radiation technique for rapid, nondestructive saturation
   measurements of multiple fluids in porous media, and to present a
   precision and accuracy analysis of the technique. Synchrotron radiation
   provides a high intensity, inherently collimated photon beam of tunable
   energy which can yield accurate measurements of fluid saturation in just
   one second. Measurements were obtained with precision of +/-0.01 or
   better for tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in a 2.5 cm thick glass-bead porous
   medium using a counting time of 1 s. The normal distribution was shown
   to provide acceptable confidence limits for PCE saturation changes.
   Sources of error include heat load on the monochromator, periodic
   movement of the source beam, and errors in stepping-motor positioning
   system. Hypodermic needles pushed into the medium to inject PCE changed
   porosity in a region approximately +/-1 mm of the injection point.
   Improved mass balance between the known and measured PCE injection
   volumes was obtained when appropriate corrections were applied to
   calibration values near the injection point. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Properties related to sorption and transport of organic compounds have
   been determined on 126 sections of 17 cores taken in an aquifer at
   Columbus Air Force Base in Columbus, MS. Each core section was
   homogenized prior to analysis. Organic carbon content (OC), specific
   surface area (SA), distribution coefficient (K-d) for naphthalene, and
   particle size distribution were measured on each section. Hydraulic
   conductivity (K-h) for each section was calculated from the particle
   size distributions. K-h values obtained were comparable with those from
   earlier borehole flowmeter and pulse bracer tests. Frequency
   distributions for all properties were lognormal. The arithmetic means
   and standard deviations for all samples are: OC = 0.028\% (+0.031,
   -0.015), SA = 4.02 m(2)/g (+3.95, -1.99), K-d = 0.198 l/kg (+0.195,
   -0.098), K-h = 0.00033 m/s (+0.00051, -0.00020). These standard
   deviations are asymmetrical about the mean because statistics were
   calculated using log-transformed data, and antilogarithms then taken to
   obtain the results in the units of property measurement. Variabilities,
   expressed as coefficients of variation, were similar for all properties.
   Correlations between the properties were investigated. A good
   correlation between naphthalene K-d and OC (r = 0.78) was found, and
   other correlations were weak, thus indicating that organic carbon
   content may control sorption of nonpolar organic solutes in this low
   carbon aquifer. Autocorrelation (variogram) analysis indicated that, for
   all properties, correlation lengths were less than the distance between
   sample points, which were separated by about 20 m horizontally and 1 m
   vertically. Separate statistical analysis of two widely separated groups
   of wells showed the groups similar in all properties, except organic
   carbon. Large-scale inhomogeneity was not detected, although earlier
   tracer tests produced irregular plumes indicating inhomogeneity in
   observed solute transport. Implications of the results to site
   characterization, in situations where aquifers are heterogeneous on
   short length scales, are discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We derive the long-term biodegradation rate of an organic contaminant
   (substrate) for an in situ bioremediation model with axisymmetric flow
   conditions. The model presumes that a nonsorbing electron acceptor is
   injected into a saturated homogeneous porous medium which initially
   contains a sorbing substrate and attached indigenous microorganisms. The
   derived analytical removal rate depends upon the injection flow rate,
   the initial substrate and supplied acceptor concentrations, the
   stoichiometric coefficient for acceptor utilization, and the sorption
   characteristics of the substrate; the removal rate does not depend upon
   the dispersion parameters, microbial kinetic parameters, and initial
   biomass concentration. Numerical simulations confirm the analytical
   results. The insensitivity of the long-term removal rate to the
   microbial kinetic parameters and initial biomass concentration suggests
   that precise estimation of these data may not be necessary to assess
   bioremediation effectiveness. In the numerical results, however, there
   exists an initial transient phase during which the removal rate depends
   upon microbial growth kinetics. This initial phase is significantly
   prolonged if the initial substrate and injected acceptor concentrations
   are at nutrient-limiting levels, or if the microbial kinetic parameters
   and initial biomass concentration do not yield efficient microbial
   growth and substrate utilization. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Soil water repellency might lead to preferential flow of water and
   solutes through the unsaturated zone of soils. To study this process in
   a water repellent sandy field soil, a bromide tracer had been applied on
   a 2.2 m long and 0.4 m wide plot. The bromide application rate was 8
   g/m(2), and the plot was sampled using 100 cm(3) steel cylinders after
   52 mm of rainfall in 12 days. A total of seven layers were sampled to a
   depth of 74 cm. Each layer was sampled at 240 locations in a 40 by 6
   grid. All samples were used for the determination of soil water content,
   degree of actual and potential water repellency, bromide concentration
   and pH. The spatial distribution of these properties was visualized
   three-dimensionally and compared. The degree of water repellency,
   bromide concentration, and pH distribution bore close resemblance to the
   fingered now induced soil water content distribution. The degree of
   potential water repellency was relatively low in places with such
   fingers. Actual water repellency occurred between the fingers at the dry
   spots. Bromide was not found, or only in very low concentrations, in
   such places. Bromide depth profiles clearly indicated the occurrence of
   diverging flow in the wetter subsoil. Most likely, manuring activities
   during the last decades resulted in relatively high pH values in the
   topsoil, and in the subsoil along the recurring fingered flow pathways.

Abstract = {{The complexity of simultaneous flow of water and non-aqueous phase
   liquids is largely unappreciated because few techniques permit accurate
   quantitative measurement of water and oil contents in rapidly changing
   now fields. High intensity X-rays were used at the Cornell High Energy
   Synchrotron Source (CHESS) to obtain rapid, accurate, and
   non-destructive quantitative measurements of the changing fluid contents
   in a porous medium during infiltration events. Concomitant temporal
   pressure measurements were obtained for each liquid phase using rapidly
   responding tensiometers. The system was used for measuring temporal
   volumetric fluid content changes during a water finger infiltration into
   sand saturated with a NAPL (Soltrol-220) in a two-dimensional chamber.
   The fluid content distribution of a finger in the oil-water system was
   found to be similar to air-water systems. The hysteretic constitutive
   relationship between pressure and the content was developed from the
   data. The relationship was used to explain why the finger did not widen
   behind the tip, and why, upon re-infiltration, water followed the
   previously established path. These findings are relevant for cleanup of
   oil-contaminated sites because it aids in the understanding of
   hydrologic control which is an essential component of cost-effective
   in-situ remediation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The difficulty of determining transient fluid contents in a
   soil-oil-water system is hampering an understanding of the system's flow
   characteristics. In this paper, we describe a light transmission method
   (LTM) which can rapidly obtain oil and water contents throughout a large
   two-dimensional flow field of silica sand. By appropriately coloring the
   water with 0.005\% FD\&C blue \#1, the hue of the transmitted light is
   found to be directly related to the water content within the porous
   media. The hue provides a high resolution measurement of the water and
   oil contents in transient flow fields (such as unstable flow).
   Evaluation of the reliability of LTM was assessed by checking the mass
   balance for a known water injection and its utility in visualizing a
   whole flow field was exemplified for unstable fingered flow by comparing
   fluid contents to those obtained with synchrotron X-ray radiation. (C)

Abstract = {{The lack of a complete mechanistic description of subsurface
   interactions between contaminants and microbes has limited the ability
   to predict the effectiveness of subsurface bioremediation processes.
   Important microbial processes which must be included in such mechanistic
   descriptions of bioremediation are microbial growth, death and
   transport, including microbial attachment to and detachment from the
   soil surfaces. Recent advances have provided a better understanding of
   the relationships between contaminant destruction rates and such
   microbial processes. In this manuscript, contaminant profiles predicted
   using more realistic descriptions are compared with those obtained using
   less complete, previously published mathematical models. The more
   comprehensive model described here includes mathematical descriptions
   for microbial growth and transport. Contaminant profiles predicted using
   this model are compared with those obtained when the contaminant
   destruction processes are described by assuming that (1) no reaction
   occurs, (2) the contaminant reacts instantaneously with any available
   oxygen, and (3) dual-substrate Monod kinetics without consideration of
   microbial growth and transport. This work demonstrates that if reaction
   kinetics are ignored, the size of the plume will be overpredicted at
   large times and if the reaction is assumed to occur instantaneously, the
   plume will be underpredicted at small times. Thus, if these processes
   are not included in the mathematical description of bioremediation,
   erroneous interpretations of site characterization data collected during
   this period would be likely. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The combined effects of nonlinear sorption, nonequilibrium mass transfer
   and the distribution of sorption sites on transport of organic
   contaminants has been examined in porous media containing aggregates of
   clay minerals and organic matter as sorbents. The major goal was to
   develop general concepts for describing, deterministically, the
   transport processes of solutes with different adsorption characteristics
   in such systems. Various sets of batch adsorption and miscible
   displacement experiments were performed covering a wide range of time
   scales and other experimental conditions. Using a multiple reactive
   tracer approach, independent information was obtained on the
   hydrodynamic properties of the columns, on the relative importance of
   the two different sorbents present, and on the accessibility and the
   distribution of these sorbents at the pore scale. The breakthrough
   curves (BTCs) of the nonlinearly sorbing tracer generally exhibited
   sharp fronts and excessive tailing, consistent with the
   Langmuir-Freundlich type adsorption at clays. The effect of
   nonequilibrium mass transfer was most evident from the tailing of the
   self-sharpened fronts of the BTCs and from the results of interrupted
   flow experiments. A two-region model, which incorporated nonlinear
   sorption and retarded intra-aggregate diffusion, successfully described
   the results of our entire set of miscible displacement data using a
   single set of parameter values. Our study demonstrates that although
   nonlinear sorption and nonequilibrium mass transfer may have very
   similar effects on solute BTCs, these processes can be distinguished
   from experimental data if experiments with different solutes, different
   flow rates and different input concentrations are evaluated
   simultaneously. It is shown that a very small volume fraction of
   immobile regions (< 0.1\% of total porosity), which is insignificant for
   the transport of conservative solutes, may strongly affect the transport
   of sorbing solutes if sorption sites are concentrated within these
   regions. In soils and aquifers, clay minerals and other reactive
   surfaces are often present in aggregates. Thus, the transport of solutes
   that strongly interact with such sites generally is very susceptible to
   rate-limited mass transfer processes while the transport of conservative
   tracers is poorly affected. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-analytical method for simulating transient contaminant transport
   originating from the dissolution of multicomponent nonaqueous phase
   liquid (NAPL) pools in three-dimensional, saturated, homogeneous porous
   media is presented. Each dissolved component may undergo first-order
   decay and may sorb under local equilibrium conditions. The NAPL pool
   dissolution process is envisioned to occur in a series of consecutive
   short intervals (pulses), The mole fraction, nonaqueous phase activity
   coefficient and aqueous solubility of every pool constituent are
   estimated before the initiation of each pulse, and they are assumed to
   remain constant for the duration of each interval. Individual component
   aqueous phase concentrations resulting from each dissolution interval
   are estimated by existing analytical solutions applicable to single
   component NAPL pools, and total concentration distributions of the same
   component are obtained by direct superposition. The semi-analytical
   method is more efficient and less computationally demanding than a
   finite-difference approximation. Furthermore, it is shown that
   neglecting the changes in nonaqueous phase activity coefficients that
   occur during multicomponent NAPL pool dissolution may result in
   erroneous predictions. The model presented in this work is useful for
   the design and interpretation of experiments in laboratory bench scale
   aquifers, certain homogeneous subsurface formations, and for the
   verification of complex numerical codes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater colloids can act as a vector which enhances the migration of
   contaminants. While sorbed to mobile colloids, contaminants can be held
   in the aqueous phase which prevents them from interacting with immobile
   aquifer surfaces. In this study, an idealized laboratory set-up was used
   to examine the influence of amorphous silica colloids on the transport
   of cesium. Synthetic groundwater and saturated glass bead columns were
   used to minimize the presence of natural colloidal material. The columns
   were assembled in replicate, some packed with 150-210 mu m glass bead
   and others packed with 355-420 mu m glass beads. The colloids used in
   these experiments were 100 nm amorphous silica colloids from Nissan
   Chemical Company. In the absence of these colloids, the retardation
   factor for cesium was 8.0 in the 150-210 mu m glass bead columns and 3.6
   in the 355-420 mu m glass bead columns. The influence of anthropogenic
   colloids was tested by injecting 0.09 pore volume slugs of an
   equilibrated suspension of cesium and colloids into the colloid-free
   columns. Although there was little noticeable facilitation in the
   smaller glass bead columns, there was a slight reduction in the
   retardation of cesium in the larger glass bead columns. This was
   attributed to cesium having less of a retention time in the larger glass
   bead columns. When cesium was injected into columns with a constant flux
   of colloids, the retardation of cesium was reduced by 14-32\% in the
   150-210 mu m glass bead columns and by 38-51\% in the 355-420 mu m glass
   bead columns. A model based on Corapcioglu and Jiang (1993)
   {[}Corapcioglu, M.Y., Jiang, S., 1993. Colloid-facilitated groundwater
   contaminant transport, Water Resour. Res., 29 (7) 2215-2226] was
   compared with the experimental elution data. When equilibrium sorption
   expressions were used and the flux of colloids through the glass bead
   columns was constant, the colloid facilitated transport of cesium was
   able to be described using an effective retardation coefficient. Fully
   kinetic simulations, however, more accurately described the colloid
   facilitated transport of cesium. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The method for simulating wells screened over several computational

   consistent approach for applying numerical boundary conditions for
   multiphase subsurface flow. J. Cent. Hyd., 23:157-184.] is applied to
   multiphase LNAPL remediation problems. Computational issues concerning
   modelling wellbore flow are discussed. Three-dimensional computations
   are presented using a multiphase, nonequilibrium mass transfer model,
   which show the effect of well placement and geometry on containment of
   the dissolved LNAPL plume and the dissolution of the NAPL phase. It is
   also shown that unless very small aqueous phase dispersion parameters
   are used, classical dispersion theory can produce unrealistic dispersion
   against the flow direction in the neighbourhood of a pumping well.
   Except in the long term, this may have implications regarding the
   prediction of near-field plume configuration and contaminant capture.

Abstract = {{Analysis of flow and transport in double/dual-porosity or fractured
   formations is a problem with important theoretical and practical
   applications. We present steady-state and transient solutions for solute
   transport in a finite system of parallel fractures with fracture skins.
   Solute transport in the fractures is by advection and hydrodynamic
   dispersion. Concentrations are attenuated by diffusion into the porous
   matrix. Radioactive decay and sorption in the skin, the matrix, and
   along the fracture walls are included. Our analysis extends previous
   studies by considering both finite fracture lengths and the effects of
   fracture skins. Our results conform to these studies when considering
   large, but finite fractures without skins. For transient solutions, we
   use a numerical inversion of the Laplace transforms and also present a
   series solution. Steady-state solutions are closed form analytical
   solutions. The results of these analyses can be used for the
   verification of numerical models used in predicting or retrodicting flow
   and transport in fractured porous media and for sensitivity analyses.
   The steady-state analyses are shown to be satisfactory for sensitivity
   analyses. We utilize data for cesium-137 and from the Permian Brushy
   Canyon Sandstone of west Texas in the sensitivity analyses to show the
   effects of fracture skins. The analyses indicate increased distances of
   transport with thicker skins of lower porosity and lower diffusivity.
   Retardation effects were smaller in magnitude. Analysis of transport in
   dual-porosity systems should consider the effects of fracture skins
   because they are ubiquitous in nature and are present in many, if not
   most, hydraulically active near-surface fractures. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Intrinsic bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes in anaerobic aquifers
   previously has not been considered feasible, due, in large part, to 1)
   the production of vinyl chloride during microbial reductive
   dechlorination of higher chlorinated contaminants and 2) the apparent
   poor biodegradability of vinyl chloride under anaerobic conditions. In
   this study, a combination of field geochemical analyses and laboratory
   radiotracer ({[}1,2-(14)C] vinyl chloride)experiments was utilized to
   assess the potential for intrinsic biodegradation of vinyl chloride
   contamination in an Fe(III)-reducing, anaerobic aquifer. Microcosm
   experiments conducted under Fe(III)-reducing conditions with material
   from the Fe(III)-reducing, chlorinated-ethene contaminated aquifer
   demonstrated significant oxidation of {[}1,2-(14)C] vinyl chloride to
   (14)CO(2) with no detectable production of ethene or other reductive
   dehalogenation products. Rates of degradation derived from the microcosm
   experiments (0.9-1.3\% d(-1)) were consistent with field-estimated rates
   (0.03-0.2\% d(-1)) of apparent vinyl chloride degradation. Field
   estimates of apparent vinyl chloride biodegradation were calculated
   using two distinct approaches; 1) a solute dispersion model and 2) a
   mass balance assessment. These findings demonstrate that degradation
   under Fe(III) reducing conditions can be an environmentally significant
   mechanism for intrinsic bioremediation of vinyl chloride in anaerobic
   ground-water systems. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption and desorption equilibria were measured for an organic
   contaminant probe, phenanthrene, and five EPA reference soils and
   sediments to evaluate the existence and extent of apparent isotherm
   hysteresis. Three different experimental protocols were tested to assess
   their relative potentials for introduction of artifact. The results
   reveal that: i) all systems studied exhibit apparent sorption-desorption
   hysteresis; ii) the three protocols tested yield significantly different
   degrees of apparent hysteresis; iii) principal sources of artifact are
   solute losses to reactor components and failure to achieve equilibrium
   sorption conditions; iv) isotherm nonlinearity elevates the potential
   for introduction of artifacts in the quantification of desorption
   hysteresis; and v) Little if any `solids effect' was observed. A
   single-cycle decant-refill batch reactor technique employing sealed and
   resealed glass ampules was found to involve minimal potential for
   introduction of artifacts. The general suitability of the procedure is
   confirmed in additional studies described in the companion paper of this
   two-part series. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption and desorption equilibria were measured for phenanthrene and 12
   different soil and sediment samples using an experimental protocol
   described in the companion paper of this two-part series. Ten of the 12
   sorbents studied were found to exhibit statistically significant
   sorption-desorption hysteresis, with those containing
   diagenetically-altered soil organic matter (kerogens) doing so to
   greater extents than those containing geologically-younger humic soil
   organic matter. Correlations between the extent of hysteresis and the
   characteristics of C-13-NMR spectra indicate that particle-scale soil
   organic matter heterogeneity significantly affects this phenomenon. The
   experimental observations are mechanistically consistent with a
   conceptual model based on polymer sorption theory, the Dual Reactive
   Domain Model (DRDM). The work reinforces the general suitability of the
   DRDM for characterizing sorption-desorption interactions between

Abstract = {{The reactive transport model TBC (transport, biochemistry, and
   chemistry) numerically solves the equations for reactive transport in
   three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow. A finite element
   approximation and a standard Galerkin method are used. Solute transport
   is coupled to microbially mediated organic carbon degradation. Microbial
   growth is assumed to follow Monod-type kinetics. Substrate consumption
   and release of metabolic products is coupled to microbial growth via
   yield coefficients and stoichiometric relations. Additionally, the
   effects of microbial activity on selected inorganic chemical species in
   the aquifer can be considered, TBC allows the user to specify a wide
   range of possible biochemical and chemical reactions in the input file.
   This makes TBC a powerful and flexible simulation tool. It was developed
   to simulate reactive processes related to in situ bioremediation, but
   further fields of application are laboratory column studies on redox
   processes coupled to organic carbon degradation, field cases of
   intrinsic biodegradation, and early diagenetic processes in sediments.

Abstract = {{The reactive transport model TBC (Transport, Biochemistry, and
   Chemistry) was applied to a laboratory column study on microbial organic
   carbon degradation by von Gunten and Zobrist {[}von Gunten, U., Zobrist,
   J., 1993. Biogeochemical changes in groundwater-infiltration systems:
   column studies, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta, 57 (1993) 3895-3906]. Five
   microbial groups were considered in the model: facultatively aerobic
   bacteria or denitrifiers, fermenters, and sulfate-, manganese-, and
   iron-reducers. By simulating their growth, subsequent consumption of
   organic carbon and electron accepters, and production of metabolic
   products, it was possible to reproduce the observed transient
   concentration changes of the reactive species. Inhibition and
   availability of electron accepters and/or organic carbon governed the
   transient growth behaviour of the different microbial groups. With the
   model the much slower growth of sulfate reducers compared to that of
   facultatively aerobic or denitrifying bacteria could be reproduced. To
   be able to reproduce the observed spatial sequence of different
   microbial groups a maximum microbial capacity had to be introduced. It
   restricts total microbial density in the porous material. Without this
   restriction the excessive organic substrate supply would have caused the
   microbial activity to be exclusively located at the immediate vicinity
   of the column inlet. The distribution of facultatively aerobic or
   denitrifying organisms and sulfate reducers in the column was determined
   by the exchange coefficient for the electron acceptor between pore water
   and biophase. The exchange of sulfate seemed to be much slower than that
   of O-2 and NO3-. The growth of manganese and iron reducers was limited
   by the availability of the solid electron accepters Fe(III) and Mn(IV).
   The testing of two hypotheses concerning the interaction of iron and
   sulfide in the column suggests that;the formation of elemental sulfur
   during abiotic reductive iron dissolution is an important sink for
   sulfide. The TBC model has proven to be complex enough to grasp the
   important reactive processes. The model provides a temporally and
   spatially resolved quantification of microbial degradation activity. It
   has shown to be a useful tool in testing alternative hypotheses on
   processes which could not directly be identified from the observed
   concentration data. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Numerical validation of a Eulerian hydrochemical code using a 1D
   multisolute mass transport system involving heterogeneous kinetically

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that at steady state, the ID thermo-kinetic
   hydrochemical Eulerian mass balance equations in pure advective mode are
   indeed identical to the governing mass balance equations of a single
   reaction path (or geochemical) code in open system mode. Thus, both
   calculated reaction paths should be theoretically identical whatever the
   chemical complexity of the water-rock system (i.e., multicomponent,
   multireaction zones kinetically and equilibrium-controlled). We propose
   to use this property to numerically test the thermo-kinetic
   hydrochemical Eulerian codes and we employ it to verify the algorithm of
   the 1D finite difference code KIRMAT. Compared to the other methods to
   perform such numerical tests (i.e., comparisons with analytical,
   semi-analytical solutions, between two Eulerian hydrochemical codes),
   the advantage of this new method is the absence of constraints on the
   chemical complexity of the modelled water-rock systems. Moreover, the
   same thermo-kinetic databases and geochemical functions can be easily
   and mechanically used in both calculations, when the numerical reference
   comes from the Eulerian code with no transport terms (u and D = 0) and
   modify to be consistent with the definition of the open system mode in
   geochemical modelling. The ability of KIRMAT to treat multicomponent
   pure advective transport, subjected to several kinetically
   equilibrium-controlled dissolution and precipitation reactions, and to
   track their boundaries has been successfully verified with the property
   of interest. The required numerical validation of the reference
   calculations is bypassed in developing the Eulerian code from an already
   checked single reaction path code. A forward time-upstream weighting
   scheme (a mixing cell scheme) is used in this study. An appropriate
   choice of grid spacing allows to calculate within the grid size
   uncertainty the correct mineral reaction zone boundaries, despite the
   presence of numerical dispersion. Its correction enables us to improve
   the convergence and to extend the numerical test to mixed
   advective-dispersive mass transport. However, the skewness factor
   involves numerical oscillations that prevent to compute different grid
   spacing. The use of a different chemically controlled time step
   constraint in both calculations induces some inconsistencies into the
   validation tests. This numerical validation method may be applied as
   well as to check a thermo-kinetic hydrochemical finite element based
   code, from a 1D heterogeneous systems, and 2D-3D systems provided that
   they are designed so as to be 1D equivalent. A one-step algorithm and
   the use of a numerical reference coming from the Eulerian code to be
   tested ensure the potential success (accuracy) of the numerical
   validation method. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical model CompFlowC + + is used to examine the relative
   importance of different formulations of a forward dissolution rate
   model, within the range of parameters measured from laboratory and field
   studies, for predicting the mean and uncertainty in dense nonaqueous

   We also investigate whether uncertainty in the DNAPL distribution due to
   imprecise knowledge of the form of the nonaqueous phase relative
   permeability curves and the variance of the heterogeneous permeability
   field are more important factors affecting the dissolution of a DNAPL
   source zone than the formulation and parameter values of the forward
   dissolution rate. Results indicate that the mean dissolution time is
   particularly sensitive to the exponent associated with the nonaqueous
   phase saturation term, in the kinetic formulation of the forward
   dissolution rate expression, while the uncertainty is sensitive to the
   Reynolds number associated with aqueous phase flow. Uncertainty in the
   DNAPL distribution due to imperfect knowledge of parameters controlling
   multiphase flow or the geostatistical nature of the aquifer exert less
   influence on the dissolution behaviour of the DNAPL source zone than the

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional flow and transport model was developed for simulating
   transient water flow and nonreactive solute transport in heterogeneous,
   unsaturated porous media containing air and water. The model is composed
   of a unique combination of robust and accurate numerical algorithms for
   solving the Richards', Darcy flux, and advection-dispersion equations.
   The mixed form of Richards' equation is solved using a finite-element
   formulation and a modified Picard iteration scheme. Mass lumping is
   employed to improve solution convergence and stability behavior. The
   flow algorithm accounts for hysteresis in the pressure head-water
   content relationship. Darcy fluxes are approximated with a Galerkin and
   Petrov-Galerkin finite-element method developed for random heterogeneous
   porous media. The transport equation is solved using an
   Eulerian-Lagrangian method. A multi-step, fourth-order Runge-Kutta,
   reverse particle tracking technique and a quadratic-linear interpolation
   scheme are shown to be superior for determining the advective
   concentration. A Galerkin finite-element method is used for
   approximating the dispersive flux. The unsaturated flow and transport
   model was applied to a variety of rigorous problems and was found to
   produce accurate, mass-conserving solutions when compared to analytical
   solutions and published numerical results. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of cation type, ionic strength, and
   pH on the performance of an anionic monorhamnolipid biosurfactant for
   solubilization and removal of residual hexadecane from sand. Three
   common soil cations, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, were used in these experiments
   and hexadecane was chosen to represent a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)
   less dense than water. Results showed that hexadecane solubility in
   rhamnolipid solution was significantly increased by the addition of Na+
   and Mg2+. Addition of up to 0.2 mM Ca2+ also increased hexadecane
   solubility. For Ca2+ concentrations greater than 0.2 mM there was little
   effect on hexadecane solubility due to competing effects of
   calcium-induced rhamnolipid precipitation and enhanced hexadecane
   solubilization. Efficiency of NAPL solubilization can be expressed in
   terms of molar solubilization ratios (MSR). The results showed that MSR
   values for hexadecane in rhamnolipid solutions increased 7.5-fold in the
   presence of 500 mM Na+, and 25-fold in the presence of 1 mM Mg2+. The
   presence of cations also reduced the interfacial tension between
   rhamnolipid solutions and hexadecane. For example, an increase in Na+
   from 0 to 800 mM caused a decrease in interfacial tension from 2.2 to
   0.89 dyn cm(-1). Similarly, decreasing pH caused a reduction in
   interfacial tension. The lowest interfacial tension value observed in
   this study was 0.02 dyn cm(-1) at pH 6 in the presence of 320 mM Na+.
   These conditions were also found to be optimal for removal of hexadecane
   residual from sand columns, with 58\% of residual removed within three
   pore volumes. The removal of residual NAPL from the packed columns was
   primarily by mobilization, even though solubilization was significantly
   increased in the presence of Na+. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The potential fate and behaviour of the herbicide isoproturon, under
   aerobic conditions, was studied in soil, chalk and groundwater from two
   sites on an unconfined aquifer in Hampshire, UK. A small but significant
   sorption potential for isoproturon was noted in the upper chalk,
   suggesting that some retardation would take place in transport through
   the chalk. The degradation potential of the samples was studied using
   laboratory microcosms. Very little degradation potential appeared to
   exist for isoproturon in the unsaturated zone of upper chalk 3 m below
   the soil surface. Wide variations in degradation rates between samples
   from the same depth was noted. A degradation potential was noted in the
   chalk from shallow depths under laboratory microcosm conditions at a
   pesticide concentration of 100 mu g l(-1). Of the two sites examined,
   the most rapid and consistent degradation observed was associated with
   the groundwater rather than the chalk in the saturated zone. No
   significant isoproturon ring mineralisation occurred in the chalk or
   groundwater samples, implying that where isoproturon degradation does
   occur a by-product containing the phenyl ring will persist. Isoproturon
   degradation potential was not directly related to the moisture content,
   total organic carbon, ability to metabolise acetate, or number of viable
   bacteria present in the sample. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{High performance computing has made possible the development of high
   resolution, multidimensional, multicomponent reactive transport models
   that can be used to analyze complex geochemical environments. However,
   as increasingly complex processes are included in these models, the
   accuracy of the numerical formulation coupling the nonlinear processes
   becomes difficult to verify. Analytical solutions are not available for
   realistically complex problems and benchmark solutions are not generally
   available for specific problems. We present an advective reactive
   streamtube (ARS) transport technique that efficiently provides accurate
   solutions of nonlinear multicomponent reactive transport in nonuniform
   multidimensional velocity fields. These solutions can be compared with
   results from Eulerian-based advection-dispersion-reaction models to
   evaluate the accuracy of the numerical formulation used. The ARS
   technique includes mixed equilibrium and kinetic complexation and
   precipitation-dissolution reactions subject to the following
   assumptions: (1) transport is purely advective (i.e., no explicit

Abstract = {{Evidence from a number of field sites suggests that water seepage
   through fractured unsaturated zones may proceed, in part, by means of
   fast preferential flow paths. This paper presents conceptual and
   numerical models which aim at developing an understanding of water
   seepage behavior in such media, and exploring conditions for fast
   preferential flow. Water seepage has been numerically simulated in
   heterogeneous fractures, which were conceptualized as two-dimensional
   heterogeneous porous media. Flow was found to proceed in dendritic
   patterns along preferential paths, giving rise to such features as
   localized pending and bypassing. Fast preferential flow can occur from
   `external' (non-uniform boundary conditions) or `internal' mechanisms
   (heterogeneities), or a combination thereof. A most effective condition
   for fast preferential flow is the presence of sub-horizontal barriers of
   significant length. Limited parameter variation studies have shown
   strong dependence of seepage patterns on fracture permeability and
   applied flow rate. The temporal evolution of seeps proceeds on a vast
   range of time scales. This casts doubt on the applicability of
   steady-state concepts for water migration in unsaturated zones of
   fractured rock where infiltration is episodic. An approximate invariance
   of seepage behavior was derived for simultaneous space-and-time scaling,
   suggesting that seepage patterns should appear more vertically elongated
   as the scale of observation is increased. Numerical simulation
   experiments have confirmed this invariance, as well as its limits of
   applicability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Leaching of nitrate contributes to the deterioration of groundwater and
   can consequently have a negative influence on the quality of our
   drinking water. Critical threshold values for nitrogen leaching are
   established to preserve groundwater quality. A critical threshold value
   for nitrate leaching of 50 mg l(-1) (11.3 mg N l(-1)), similar to the
   drinking water standard, serves as a threshold value for European
   countries. However, the temporal aggregation scale on which this
   threshold value should be considered is unknown. A well tested
   simulation model was used to evaluate the exceedance of the threshold
   value at different time aggregation levels, ranging from one day till 30
   yr. For three different soil structure types within one soil type and a
   selected fertilisation regime, the aggregated nitrogen leaching over 30
   yr was 11.4, 19.2 and 10.6 mg l(-1) Considering an aggregation level of
   one day, the critical threshold value of 11.3 mg N l(-1) was exceeded
   2973, 5801 and 2556 times, respectively, for the three structure types
   during 30 yr. By considering other time aggregation levels, a clear
   relation resulted between time aggregation level and the number of time
   elements during which the critical level was exceeded. Results strongly
   indicate that a critical threshold value for leaching should include an
   associated time-aggregation level. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We present here an application of a new experimental method called the
   `interfacial tracers technique' (IFTT), using tracer retardation by
   adsorption as the basis, to determine the specific NAPL-water
   interfacial areas (a(nw), cm(2)/cm(3)) in packed columns of sand and
   glass beads containing residual saturation of non-aqueous phase liquid
   (NAPLs). Four NAPLs, two types of sand and uniform glass beads, and two
   interfacial tracers were used in the tracer experiments. The a(nw)
   values determined for residual NAPLs in sand or glassbead columns were
   in the range of 60 to 300 (with one exception of 1200) cm(2)/cm(3), and
   are in agreement with the current understanding of immiscible fluid
   behavior in porous media. For a given NAPL, the a(nw) value was found to
   be about twice as large when the porous medium was NAPL wet first,
   compared to when the medium was first water wet. The interfacial tracer
   technique will be useful in assessing NAPL morphology, dissolution and
   mass transfer, and is useful in the characterization and remediation
   assessment at NAPL-contaminated waste sites. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A large sand column experiment is used to illustrate the principles of
   complex organic contaminants (DNAPL) recovery by a chemical solution
   containing an alcohol (n-butanol), a surfactant (Hostapur SAS), and two
   solvents (d-limonene and toluene). The washing solution is pushed by
   viscous polymer solutions to keep the displacement stable. The main NAPL
   recovery mechanisms identified are: (1) immiscible displacement by oil
   saturation increase (oil swelling), oil viscosity reduction, interfacial
   tension lowering, and relative permeability increase; (2) miscible NAPL
   displacement by solubilization. Most of the NAPL was recovered in a
   Winsor, type TT system ahead of the washing solution. The 0.8 pore
   volume (PV) of alcohol-surfactant-solvent solution injected recovered
   more than 89\% of the initial residual DNAPL saturation (0.195). Winsor
   system types were determined by visual observation of phases and
   confirmed by electrical resistivity measurements of phases and water
   content measurements in the oleic phase. Viscosity and density lowering
   of the oleic phase was made using solvents and alcohol transfer from the
   washing solution.
   Small sand column tests are performed to check different rinsing
   strategies used to minimize washing solution residual ingredients which
   can be trapped in sediments. An alcohol/surfactant rinsing solution
   without solvent, injected behind the washing solution, minimizes solvent
   trapping in sediments, More than five pore volumes of polymer solution
   and water must be injected after the rinsing solution to decrease
   alcohol and SAS concentrations in sediments to an acceptable level. To
   obtain reasonable trapped surfactant concentrations in sediments, the
   displacement front between the rinsing solution and the subsequent the
   following polymer solution has to be stable. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A field test was performed to recover DNAPL (Dense Non Aqueous Phase
   Liquid) in a shallow aquifer at the Thouin Sand Pit near Montreal, to
   evaluate a new technique of aquifer restoration involving surfactant
   solutions. Laboratory tests have shown that washing solutions containing
   alcohols, surfactants, and solvents are very efficient in recovering
   DNAPL as a miscible phase. The Thouin field test was designed to: (1)
   study in situ recovery of DNAPL; (2) evaluate an injection-pumping
   strategy; (3) test the use of polymer solutions to control the mobility
   of a washing solution slug and to improve the vertical sweep efficiency
   throughout the sand unit. The test was performed in a shallow medium
   sand aquifer containing both contaminated saturated and unsaturated
   zones. The washing experiment was done on 17 m(3) of the saturated zone
   with an average DNAPL initial concentration of 55 000 mg kg(-1) dry
   soil. Solutions were injected through a central well and pumped into
   four wells arranged in a five-point square pattern. In the zone swept by
   the washing solution, 86\% of residual DNAPL was recovered using only
   0.9 pore volume of a surfactant solution. These results confirm
   laboratory sand column experiments although the washing solution used in
   the field experiment had not yet been optimized to meet site-specific
   criteria. The use of a polymer solution before and after injection of
   the washing solution proved beneficial in insuring that the washing
   solution effectively swept all the sand layers in spite of soil
   heterogeneities. As the rinsing cycles were not completed because of
   weather problems (freezing conditions), small but significant amounts of
   the washing solution ingredients were still present in the aquifer at
   the end of the test and their fate is being monitored. For this field
   test, DNAPL recovery could have been better if an optimal washing
   solution had been injected, a larger volume of the selected solution had
   been circulated, or a different injection-pumping strategy had been
   chosen. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Transuranic (TRU) radionuclides in groundwater at the Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory migrate rapidly and with little retardation of the
   radionuclides over distances of 80 m. Several interacting
   hydrogeochemical processes contribute to the observed releases of
   actinides (Cm-244 and Am-241) from the shallow unlined disposal
   trenches, through the highly weathered, fractured shale (saprolite) and
   to the surface-water seeps at White Oak Creek. Major releases are
   promoted when seasonal fluctuations in the water table permit
   groundwater to contact actinide-contaminated waste. Local recharge of
   stormwater into the trenches appears to permit minor releases, perhaps
   due to transient saturation within the trenches but above the local
   water table. Although the hydrogeology of the site permits contact of
   the TRU waste with the groundwater, the expected inorganic species of
   the actinides should strongly adsorb to the layer silicates and mineral
   oxides of the shale saprolite, Yet the timing of the actinide releases
   relative to when rising groundwater intercepts the trenches suggests
   that actinide transport is rapid, and the relative magnitude of peak
   actinide levels in wells near the trenches and at downgradient seeps
   suggests that then is very limited retention of the actinides by the
   formation. Based on anion exchange chromatography of the groundwater and
   geochemical modeling, the mobilization and transport of the actinides is
   demonstrated to result from complexation of the actinides by natural
   organic matter (NOM). Storm events contribute to mobilization by
   promoting hydrologic links between the TRU waste and groundwater, and by
   increasing the concentration of NOM in the mobile soil and groundwater.
   This study demonstrates that even in formations characterized by
   abundant mineral phases known to strongly adsorb actinides, the
   actinides can be transported essentially conservatively as NOM
   complexes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations with a dual permeability model show that a few discrete
   fractures can have a major influence on plume geometry. A limited number
   of truncated fractures (1-4) within a permeable matrix can create nearly
   circular plumes, with about the same degree of spreading in the
   direction transverse to the average hydraulic gradient as in the
   longitudinal direction. By comparison, continuous fractures in the
   direction of flow tend to produce elongated plumes, similar to those
   typically seen in granular materials. Both types of plumes have been
   observed in tracer experiments in fractured porous media on the Oak
   Ridge Reservation. Understanding the influence of fracture geometry is
   important in planning field characterization and subsequent remediation
   in fractured porous media. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The capability of the convection-dispersion model coupled with the
   Richards equation to predict transient transport of water and solutes in
   porous media is studied in a laboratory soil column. The solutes used
   are (H2O)-H-3 as a conservative tracer and C-14-labeled dibutylphthalate
   (DBP) as a sorbing solute. To account for multiple nonideal transport
   processes, a model was developed that may consider hysteresis of the
   water retention curve, sorption nonequilibrium (sorption kinetics and
   sorption hysteresis) and mobile and immobile water domains during solute
   transport. The model parameters were determined independently from the
   transient experiments, but on the same soil column to avoid uncertainty
   in transferring results from one sample to another. The hydraulic
   properties of the soil column were estimated by a multistep outflow
   experiment using inverse modeling. Transport parameters were estimated
   form breakthrough curves of (H2O)-H-3 measured under steady-state flow
   conditions. The sorption parameters of DBP were determined using batch
   techniques. Matrix potentials in the soil could not be predicted using a
   simple hysteresis model. Whereas the prediction of the tracer transport
   was satisfactory, it was not successful for DBP, inspite taking all
   nonequilibrium processes into account. DBP showed an early breakthrough
   and fluctuations in the outflow concentrations, which were induced by
   changes in the hydraulic boundary conditions. These fluctuations are
   caused by exchange processes during redistribution. The results suggest
   that models based on equilibrium assumptions may not always be suitable
   to predict the observed transport patterns. A calibration of the
   multinonequilibrium convective-dispersive model with the measured data,
   however, was possible. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The macrodispersion of an inert solute in a 2-D heterogeneous porous
   media is estimated numerically in a series of fields of varying
   heterogeneity. Four different random function (RF) models are used to
   model log-transmissivity (ln T) spatial variability, and for each of
   these models, In T variance is varied from 0.1 to 2.0. The four RF
   models share the same univariate Gaussian histogram and the same
   isotropic covariance, but differ from one another in terms of the
   spatial connectivity patterns at extreme transmissivity values. More
   specifically, model A is a multivariate Gaussian model for which, by
   definition, extreme values (both high and low) are spatially
   uncorrelated. The other three models are non-multi-Gaussian: model B
   with high connectivity of high extreme values, model C with high
   connectivity of low extreme values, and model D with high connectivities
   of both high and low extreme values. Residence time distributions (RTDs)
   and macrodispersivities (longitudinal and transverse) are computed on
   lnT fields corresponding to the different RF models, for two different
   flow directions and at several scales. They are compared with each
   other, as well as with predicted values based on first-order analytical
   results. Numerically derived RTDs and macrodispersivities for the
   multi-Gaussian model are in good agreement with analytically derived
   values using first-order theories for log-transmissivity variance up to
   2.0. The results from the non-multi-Gaussian models differ from each
   other and deviate largely from the multi-Gaussian results even when In T
   variance is small. RTDs in non-multi-Gaussian realizations with high
   connectivity at high extreme values display earlier breakthrough than in
   multi-Gaussian realizations, whereas later breakthrough and longer tails
   are observed for RTDs from non-multi-Gaussian realizations with high
   connectivity at low extreme values. Longitudinal macrodispersivities in
   the non-multi-Gaussian realizations are, in general, larger than in the
   multi-Gaussian ones, while transverse macrodispersivities in the
   non-multi-Gaussian realizations can be larger or smaller than in the
   multi-Gaussian ones depending on the type of connectivity at extreme
   values. Comparing the numerical results for different flow directions,
   it is confirmed that macrodispersivities in multi-Gaussian realizations
   with isotropic spatial correlation are not flow direction-dependent.
   Macrodispersivities in the nonmulti-aaussian realizations, however, are
   flow direction-dependent although the covariance of ln T is isotropic
   (the same for all four models). It is important to account for high
   connectivities at extreme transmissivity values, a likely situation in
   some geological formations. Some of the discrepancies between
   first-order-based analytical results and field-scale tracer test data
   may be due to the existence of highly connected paths of extreme
   conductivity values. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Significant groundwater contamination by trichloroethene (TCE) has been
   identified in the Spearwood Sands aquifer, Perth Western Australia. The
   organic carbon content of the aquifer sediment is very low and reported
   retardation coefficients for TCE in low organic carbon subsurface
   environments an rare. Carbon-based correlation equations were reported
   to underestimate the retardation of nonionic hydrophobic organic
   compounds in aquifers characterised by low organic carbon contents.
   Estimating the retardation coefficient for TCE in the Spearwood Sands
   aquifer, therefore, is difficult. Various methods to estimate the
   retardation coefficient for TCE in the Spearwood Sands aquifer were
   investigated. Estimates obtained by commonly used correlation equations
   were compared to retardation coefficients calculated based on laboratory
   batch and column studies. An in situ transport experiment using
   deuterium labelled TCE (TCEd1) within a TCE contaminated zone was
   carried out to assess the reliability of the various estimation
   techniques. The field transport experiment showed that TCEd1 was not
   retarded in the Spearwood Sands aquifer. Carbon-based correlations
   overestimated the retardation coefficient for TCE. The equations are
   shown to be limited by the lack of reliable estimates of the organic
   carbon content for the Spearwood Sands. Laboratory batch studies
   resulted in more reliable estimates of TCE retardation. Retardation
   coefficients from the batch studies, however, were still overestimated
   since Teflon-coated silicone liners used in the experiments show
   considerably higher sorption capacity for TCE than does the aquifer
   sediment. Laboratory column studies were accurate in assessing the
   sorption behaviour of TCE in the Spearwood Sands. Column studies
   eliminated the additional uncertainty inherent in determining the input
   concentration for TCE, by assessing the retardation coefficient in
   relation to an inorganic tracer. Column studies also avoided the
   experimental difficulties experienced with the batch studies and proved
   to be more cost effective. It is shown, however, that also with batch
   experiments an accurate prediction of the field retardation for TCE can
   be obtained, if naphthalene is used in the batch studies to determine
   the sorptive properties of the sediment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of modelling and experimental
   investigations of factors affecting enhanced transport of hydrophobic
   organic compounds (HOCs) on colloids in porous media, especially effects
   of nonequilibrium sorption/desorption. Simulations were performed with a
   model that considers equilibrium and rate-limited exchange of
   contaminant between the true dissolved phase, the suspended and attached
   colloids, and the fixed solid phase as well as the advection,
   dispersion, deposition, and release of colloidal particles from the
   porous medium. The model was also applied to laboratory column data for
   colloid-facilitated transport of a common HOC, phenanthrene. Simulations
   of colloid-enhanced transport and fitting of experimental data indicated
   that colloid-enhancement of hydrophobic organic contaminant transport
   can be signifi cant for sufficiently high colloid concentrations, a high
   partition coefficient of contaminant on colloids with respect to the
   fixed porous medium, a low deposition efficiency of the colloids on the
   fixed porous medium surfaces, and a slow desorption rate of contaminant
   from the colloids. The last of these conditions was identified as
   probably the most important in enhancing transport distances of
   contaminants in natural systems with mobile colloids which usually occur
   at concentrations not exceeding a few mg/l. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Pesticide leaching models are being used to assist in the regulation and
   management of pesticides by indicating their potential for leaching to
   groundwater. Uncertainty in model input data is not, regrettably,
   included in most pesticide leaching assessments. In the work described
   here, we use logarithmic transformations of the attenuation factor (AF),
   a simple process-based index model, to represent uncertainty in a
   pesticide leaching assessment. Characterization of a wide range of
   pesticides as `leachers' or `non-leachers' for a specific Hawaii
   hydrogeological setting is facilitated by comparing the log-transformed
   AF, designated AFR, for each chemical with two reference chemicals for
   which leaching behavior in Hawaii is known. Defining a mean and
   uncertainty interval for the AFR index of each chemical being ranked
   provides a practical method of incorporating data uncertainty into a
   regulatory protocol. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A landfill leachate affected aquifer was investigated with respect to
   the geology and sediment geochemistry (solid organic carbon, cation
   exchange capacity, oxidation capacity, reduced iron and sulfur species)
   involving 185 sediment samples taken along a 305-m-long and 10-12-m-deep
   transect downgradient from the landfill. The geology showed two distinct
   sand layers (upper Quaternary, Weichselian and a lower Tertiary,
   Miocene) sandwiching thin layers of silt/clay deposits, peat and brown
   coal. The organic carbon content (TOC) and the cation exchange capacity
   (CEC) of the sandy sediments were low (TOC, 100-300 mu g C (g DW)(-1);
   CEC, 0.1-0.5 meg per 100 g DW) and correlated fairly well with the
   geology. Processes in the contaminant plume caused depletion of
   oxidation capacity and precipitation of reduced iron and sulfur species.
   However, some of these parameters were also affected by the geology,
   e.g. the oxidation capacity (OXC) was significantly higher in the
   Quaternary layer (OXC, 14-35 mu eq g DW-1) than in the Tertiary sand
   layer (OXC, < 5 mu eq g DW-1). The intermediate layers (silt/clay and
   brown coal) have significantly higher values of most of the parameters
   investigated. This work demonstrates the need for a small scale
   geological model and a detailed mapping of the geochemistry of the
   sediments in order to distinguish impacts caused by the contaminant
   plumes from natural variations in the aquifer geochemistry. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Phase diagrams were used for the formulation of
   alcohol-surfactant-solvent and to identify the DNAPL (Dense Non Aqueous
   Phase Liquid) extraction zones. Four potential extraction zones of
   Mercier DNAPL, a mixture of heavy aliphatics, aromatics and chlorinated
   hydrocarbons, were identified but only one microemulsion zone showed
   satisfactory DNAPL recovery in sand columns. More than 90 sand column
   experiments were performed and demonstrate that: (1) neither surfactant
   in water, alcohol-surfactant solutions, nor pure solvent can effectively
   recover Mercier DNAPL and that only alcohol-surfactant-solvent solutions
   are efficient; (2) adding salts to alcohol-surfactant or to
   alcohol-surfactant-solvent solutions does not have a beneficial effect
   on DNAPL recovery; (3) washing solution formulations are site specific
   and must be modified if the surface properties of the solids
   (mineralogy) change locally, or if the interfacial behavior of liquids
   (type of oil) changes; (4) high solvent concentrations in washing
   solutions increase DNAPL extraction but also increase their cost and
   decrease their density dramatically; (5) maximum DNAPL recovery is
   observed with alcohol-surfactant-solvent formulations which correspond
   to the maximum solubilization in Zone C of the phase diagram; (6)
   replacing part of surfactant SAS by the alcohol n-butanol increases
   washing solution efficiency and decreases the density and the cost of
   solutions; (7) replacing part of n-butanol by the nonionic surfactant
   HOES decreases DNAPL recovery and increases the cost of solutions; (8)
   toluene is a better solvent than D-limonene because it increases DNAPL
   recovery and decreases the cost of solutions; (9) optimal
   alcohol-surfactant-solvent solutions contain a mixture of solvents in a
   mass ratio of toluene to D-limonene of one or two. Injection of 1.5 pore
   volumes of the optimal washing solution of
   n-butanol-SAS-toluene-D-limonene in water can recover up to 95\% of
   Mercier DNAPL in sand columns. In the first pore volume of the washing
   solution recovered in the sand column effluent, the DNAPL is in a
   water-in-oil microemulsion Lighter than the excess aqueous phase (Winsor
   Type II system), which indicates that part of the DNAPL was mobilized.
   In the next pore volumes, DNAPL is dissolved in a oil-in-water
   microemulsion phase and is mobilized in an excess oil phase lighter than
   the microemulsion (Winsor Type I system). The main drawback of this oil
   extraction process is the high concentration of ingredients necessary
   for DNAPL dissolution, which makes the process expensive. Because
   mobilization of oil seems to occur at the washing solution front, an
   injection strategy must be developed if there is no impermeable limit at
   the aquifer base. DNAPL recovery in the field could be less than
   observed in sand columns because of a smaller sweep efficiency related
   to field sand heterogeneities. The role of each component in the
   extraction processes in sand column as well as the Winsor system type
   have to be better defined for modeling purposes. Injection strategies
   must be developed to recover ingredients of the washing solution that
   can remain in the soil at the end of the washing process. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The sorption of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and tetrachloroethene was
   investigated in a series of well-controlled batch experiments, using
   authigenic soil materials from a profile extending to 2.5 m below ground
   surface. Batch experiment techniques were verified by study with both
   pulverized and unpulverized soil at different times of equilibration,
   using two widely different soil:water ratios, and at a wide range of
   aqueous concentration. Sorption isotherms were approximately Linear,
   with sorption distribution coefficients (K-d) found to decrease roughly
   100-fold down the soil profile. K-d decreased with depth to an extent
   greater than could be predicted on the basis of the only 10-fold
   decrease in natural solid organic matter (SOM) content and despite
   significantly higher specific surface area in the lower horizons. All
   base-extractable SOM in these deeper soil horizons was operationally
   defined as fulvic acid (FA), although there was also a significant
   fraction that was not extracted by the standard base technique. The
   lower K-d of the deeper soil horizons is believed to reflect a complex
   combination of (1) lower SOM content; (2) a more hydrophilic form of
   SOM; and (3) a more intimate association of the SOM with the mineral
   fraction, affecting its accessibility, sorptivity, or both. For the
   deeper horizons, an increase in overall K-d by more than 1-fold was
   observed on solids treated by either base extraction or H2O2 treatment,
   demonstrating that sorption to remaining soil components could be
   dramatically increased by fractional SOM removal and/or chemical
   alteration of the soil. A simple regression model that divides SOM into
   only two types (shallow and deep SOM) provides a reasonably good
   explanation of sorption in all seven horizons and suggests an
   order-of-magnitude variability in K(oc)among surface soil and deeper
   horizons. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Dehalogenation of chlorinated aliphatic contaminants at the surface of
   zero-valent iron metal (Fe(0)) is mediated by the thin film of iron
   (hydr)oxides found on Fe(0) under environmental conditions. To evaluate
   the role this oxide film plays in the reduction of chlorinated methanes,
   carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) degradation by Fe(0) was studied under the
   influence of various anions, ligands, and initial CCl(4) concentrations
   ({[}P](0)). Over the range of conditions examined in these batch
   experiments, the reaction kinetics could be characterized by
   surface-area-normalized rate constants that were pseudo-first order for
   CCl(4) disappearance (k(CCl4)), and zero order for the appearance of
   dissolved Fe(2+) (k(Fe2+)). The rate of dechlorination exhibits
   saturation kinetics with respect to {[}P](0), suggesting that CCl(4) is
   transformed at a limited number of reactive surface sites. Because
   oxidation of Fe(0) by CCl(4) is the major corrosion reaction in these
   systems, k(Fe2+) also approaches a limiting value at high CCl(4)
   concentrations. The adsorption of borate strongly inhibited reduction of
   CCl(4), but a concomitant addition of chloride partially offset this
   effect by destabilizing the film. Redox active ligands (catechol and
   ascorbate), and those that are not redox active (EDTA and acetate), all
   decreased k(CCl4) (and k(Fe2+)). Thus, it appears that the relatively
   strong complexation of these Ligands at the oxide-electrolyte interface
   blocks the sites where weak interactions with the metal oxide lead to
   dehalogenation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of a sharp interface between salt and fresh
   waters in an aquifer of spatially variable permeability. We assume a
   layered structure, with permeability a stationary random function of the
   vertical coordinate, of given mean and two point covariance. The flow is
   shallow and it obeys the Dupuit assumption.
   We derive an exact analytical solution of two-dimensional steady flow of
   fresh water in a confined aquifer, with salt water at rest. The mean
   interface shape is a Dupuit parabola, for a constant effective
   permeability equal to the arithmetic mean of the random permeability.
   The variance of the interface coordinate, and particularly of the toe,
   depends on the permeability variance and integral scale. The uncertainty
   of the interface location can be large. We also investigate the
   uncertainty of the discharge of a coastal collector, for a given depth
   of the upconed interface. We also determine, by using conditional
   probability, the impact of measurement of the interface depth in a given
   cross-section on the reduction of the uncertainty of its position.
   The second case is the generalization of the solution by Keulegan (1954,
   National Bureau of Standards Report, Department of Commerce, Washington,
   DC) of unsteady flow that results from an abrupt removal of a thin
   vertical partition between salt-and freshwater bodies. The mean
   interface is similar to that prevailing in a homogeneous medium, i.e. a
   rotating line whose slope approximately corresponds to the permeability
   arithmetic mean. The uncertainty affecting the interface position is of
   a smaller extent than that in steady flow. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Few proven technologies exist that may be used to treat dense
   non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminants. In-situ chemical flushing
   is a proposed technology which consists of flushing DNAPL source zones
   with a reactive solution to degrade the contaminant mass below ground.
   A laboratory and controlled field experimental program was conducted to
   assess the potential of potassium permanganate (KMnO4) as a reagent for
   in-situ DNAPL remediation. The results of laboratory experiments
   indicated that two common DNAPL contaminants, perchloroethylene (PCE)
   and trichloroethylene (TCE), were rapidly degraded to chloride and
   carbon dioxide. Column experiments, using residual PCE flushed with
   oxidant concentrations as high as 10 g L-1, indicated that chloride
   could be used as a reaction tracer. From the chloride data, it appeared
   that the rate of PCE removal from the columns was a complex process
   dependent upon the kinetics of both dissolution and oxidation.
   Two experimental applications of in-situ oxidation were conducted in the
   Borden aquifer isolated within a 7.5 m(3) double sheet-pile cell. The
   cell was fitted with injection and recovery wells through which aqueous
   solutions of KMnO4 were flushed to oxidize solvent source zones in situ.
   In the initial experiment, flushing of a 1 L PCE residual source with 10
   g L-1 KMnO4 at total flow rates of up to 100 L per day, completely
   removed the source within 120 days. A second experiment, using an 8 L
   mixture of PCE and TCE slowly allowed to infiltrate into the cell, was
   conducted using a system to recycle the oxidant. The oxidant was added
   at 10 g L-1 with a flow of approximately 50 L per day. After 290 days of
   flushing, it was concluded from the monitoring data that 62\% of the
   initial source (as equivalent chloride mass) had been oxidized and it
   was evident that oxidation was continuing in the upper third of the
   cell.
   These experiments have suggested that the effectiveness of in-situ
   chemical oxidation will depend primarily upon the distribution of the
   DNAPL in the subsurface and its effects upon dissolution. In both
   experiments, spatial variability of chloride measurements appeared to
   reflect both the DNAPL location and distribution. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A large scale groundwater remediation project using pump-and-treat (PAT)
   or pump-treat-inject (PTI) cannot be designed as a single time-step
   operation, because of uncertainties associated with the system. The
   changes in concentrations in reality may differ significantly from
   predicted ones. Instead, a multi-stage decision process is formulated
   and solved as a two-level hierarchical optimization model. Cost serves
   as the objective function, while contaminant concentration and total
   cleanup time are constraints. The entire cleanup time is divided into
   several stages. The number of wells for both pumping and injection is
   treated as a decision variable in each design stage. At the basic level,
   well locations and pumping/injection rates are sought so as to maximize
   mass removal of contaminants. At the upper level, the number of wells
   for pumping and injection is optimized, so as to minimize the cost,
   taking maximum contaminant level (MCL) as a constraint. Indices for the
   equivalent centroid and areal extent of a contaminant plume are proposed
   and used to initiate well locations at each design stage. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A study of elemental transport at the Akrotiri archeological site on the
   island of Santorini, Greece, has been conducted to evaluate the use of
   natural analog data in support of long-term predictive modeling of the
   performance of a proposed geologic repository for nuclear waste at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada. Akrotiri and Yucca Mountain have many analogous
   features including silicic volcanic rocks, relatively dry climates, and
   oxidizing, hydrologically unsaturated subsurface conditions. Transport
   of trace elements from artifacts buried in volcanic ash 3600 years ago
   at Akrotiri is analogous to transport of radioactive wastes in the
   proposed repository. Subtle evidence for a plume of Cu, Zn, and Pb has
   been detected by selective leaching of packed earth and bedrock samples
   collected immediately beneath the site where bronze and lead artifacts
   were excavated. The geologic setting of the artifacts and the hydraulic
   properties of the enclosing media were characterized. A numerical model
   of the type used in repository performance assessments was developed for
   elemental transport at the site. Site characterization data were used to
   build the model but no prior information on the nature of the
   contaminant plume was provided to the modelers, Some model results are
   qualitatively consistent with field data, including the small amount of
   material transported, limited amounts of sorbed material, and relatively
   elevated sorption on a packed earth layer. However, discrepancies result
   from incomplete representation of heterogeneity and complexity and
   poorly constrained model parameters. Identification of such system
   characteristics and model limitations in relevant systems is a major
   contribution that analog studies can contribute in support of repository
   modeling. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The use of synthesized aqueous solutions for determining experimentally
   derived strontium sorption isotherms of sediment was investigated as
   part of a study accessing strontium chemical transport properties. Batch
   experimental techniques were used to determine strontium sorption
   isotherms using synthesized aqueous solutions designed to chemically
   represent water from a natural aquifer with respect to major ionic
   character and pH. A strontium sorption isotherm for a sediment derived
   using a synthesized aqueous solution was found to be most comparable to
   an isotherm derived using natural water when the synthesized aqueous
   solution contained similar concentrations of calcium and magnesium,
   However, it is difficult to match compositions exactly due to the
   effects of disequilibrium between the solution and the sediment, Strong
   linear relations between sorbed strontium and solution concentrations of
   calcium and magnesium confirm that these cations are important
   co-constituents in these synthesized aqueous solutions. Conversely, weak
   linear relations between sorbed strontium and solution concentrations of
   sodium and potassium indicate that these constituents do not affect
   sorption of strontium. The addition of silica to the synthesized aqueous
   solution does not appreciably affect the resulting strontium sorption
   isotherm. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the first installment of a multi-paper series concerned
   with simulating the potential vulnerability of groundwater in Fresno
   County (California) to contamination resulting from long-term,
   agriculture related, applications of the nematocide DBCP. In this paper
   our focus is on the surface and the unsaturated subsurface. Using
   PRZM-2, we quantitatively estimate, for a 35 year period, the potential
   fate and transport of DBCP between the surface and the water table for
   multiple non-point source applications, related to different and
   changing land-use, between 1960 and 1977. Our transport simulations
   include consideration for advection, decay, sorption, and
   volatilization. The results presented here indicate tremendous spatial
   and temporal variability in DBCP loading at the water table at the
   regional scale. Our simulations also suggest that the DBCP loading to
   the water table, resulting from the legacy of the chemical's use, is
   currently well below the detectable limit. The characterization of
   spatially variable DBCP loadings to the saturated subsurface through
   time, which are presented in this paper, is used as input for the 3-D
   groundwater models of DBCP fate and transport in Fresno County between
   1960 and 1994 that are reported in the companion paper (League et al.,
   1997).

   assessment of DBCP transport in the saturated subsurface. Here, the
   groundwater flow code MODFLOW is coupled to the solute transport code
   MT3D to simulate the potential fate and transport of DBCP below the
   water table in the Fresno County study area for a 35-yr period. The
   results presented here illustrate the long-term regional-scale evolution
   of the DBCP plume in the study area. The simulated DBCP concentrations
   are limited to the relatively shallow younger sediments and are
   generally well below the maximum contaminant level set for the chemical.
   The simulations presented here suggest that nonpoint source applications
   of DBCP are not responsible for the observed hot spots in the study
   area, At the end of this paper we discuss the implications and
   extensions of the Fresno case study which has been reported here and in
   the companion paper mentioned above (Loague et al., 1997).

Abstract = {{A column study was initiated to study the effect of phenanthrene,
   fluorene, and p-cresol on the aerobic biodegradation of carbazole in
   columns of sandy aquifer material. Biodegradation of the contaminant
   mixture was sequential in space with p-cresol being preferentially
   degraded, followed by phenanthrene, then the other compounds, Both
   p-cresol and phenanthrene were completely biotransformed to
   non-detectable levels during passage through the 46 cm sand column but
   some carbazole and fluorene persisted throughout the approximately 3
   month experiments, Influent p-cresol (10 000 ppb) was the only compound
   that affected adaptation of the microbial community to carbazole
   biodegradation, but its effect was of little practical importance,
   amounting to a 4.5 day difference in carbazole breakthrough. However,
   when influent p-cresol was at high levels (70 000 ppb),
   biotransformation of the other co-substrates in the mixture never ensued
   because p-cresol caused complete dissolved oxygen depletion. Conversely,
   influent p-cresol ultimately enhanced biotransformation of the other
   co-substrates in the mixture when present at a concentration (10 000
   ppb) that did not deplete all available oxygen. The concentrations of
   the other, more recalcitrant compounds, ranging between 33 and 238 ppb,
   were probably too low to support bacterial growth so that slow, limited
   biotransformation resulted, although addition of an auxiliary substrate
   (i.e. the p-cresol) stimulated their biotransformation. Under
   quasi-steady-state conditions, the presence of phenanthrene in the
   influent inhibited fluorene biotransformation and possibly carbazole
   biotransformation. Results of the present study demonstrated also that
   interactions identified in static batch microcosms and in a hydrodynamic
   saturated column system can differ. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Determination of gaseous phase diffusion through unsaturated soil beds
   is essential for estimating the transport of volatile contaminants and
   designing remediation processes in the vadose zone. Factors controlling
   gas phase diffusion include both the distribution of pore sizes and
   water within the soil matrix. Diffusion column experiments were carried
   out to measure the effective diffusivity of argon gas through air as a
   function of soil moisture content and soil physical characteristics.
   Argon was chosen as a non-sorbing tracer because of its low aqueous
   solubility and chemical inertness. Thus, direct calculation of gaseous
   phase diffusion resistance was possible. A diffusion model based on
   parallel diffusion between interparticle pore and macropore regimes was
   developed. This model incorporates pore size distribution information
   along with other readily obtainable soil bed parameters. The new model
   provided better agreement with experimental data than did other existing
   models. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This study is a laboratory test of the aquifer remediation concept
   proposed by Gvirtzman and Gorelick (1992, Transp. Porous Media, 8:
   71-92), which involves the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
   dissolved in groundwater. The principle is to inject air into a well,
   creating air-lift pumping, which is used as a means of in-well vapor
   stripping. The partially treated water is separated from the VOC vapor
   and infiltrates back to the water table. A laboratory-scale aquifer
   model containing a remediation-well prototype was used to trace VOC
   removal over time. The removal rates of trichloroethylene (TCE), toluene
   and chloroform were monitored using eight triple-level observation
   wells. The continuous decrease of VOC concentrations in space and time
   was interpreted based on three processes: (1) the diffusional mass
   transfer between the contaminated water and the air bubbles during their
   rise within the well; (2) the desorption of VOCs from the solid matrix
   to the water phase; (3) the flow field in the saturated zone driven by
   the continuous water circulation between the pumping well and the
   recharging area. In a companion paper (Pinto et al., 1997),
   three-dimensional flow and transport modeling with inter-phase mass
   transfer is carried out to simulate these processes. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from groundwater
   through in-well vapor stripping has been demonstrated by Gonen and
   Gvirtzman (1997, J. Contam. Hydrol., 00: 000-000) at the laboratory
   scale. The present study compares experimental breakthrough curves with
   those predicted by three-dimensional numerical simulation of VOC
   transport, volatilization, and removal. We are able to sufficiently
   model the behavior of the laboratory system by assuming an isotropic,
   homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field and uniform linear retardation
   of the VOCs. The exponential reductions in concentrations of
   trichlorethylene, chloroform, and toluene were well represented by the
   simulation model. Local disparities between experimental and simulated
   breakthrough curves appear to result primarily from differences between
   the actual and estimated initial concentrations, and secondarily from
   differences in the actual and modeled flow field, Our analysis suggests
   that the in-well vapor stripping process is understood at the laboratory
   scale. The model developed for this work provides a sound basis for
   current analysis at the field scale.}},

Abstract = {{The speciation of Pb in batch experiments and its mobility under flowing
   conditions in column transport experiments were investigated to study Pb
   behavior in a soil-water system in the presence of dissolved natural
   organic matter (DOM), peat humic acid (PHA) and peat fulvic acid (PFA).
   A sandy soil having a significant intraparticle porosity was used as the
   sorbing media. Batch equilibrium sorption isotherms for single
   components (Pb, PHA, and PFA) and for Pb in the presence of PHA and PFA
   were generated. Batch equilibrium experiments were also performed for
   both PHA and PFA to investigate Pb-DOM binding in the absence of soil.
   Single component (Pb, PHA, and PFA) and multicomponent (Pb-PHA and
   Pb-PFA) laboratory-scale column transport experiments were conducted to
   assess transport behavior of Pb in the presence of DOM.
   Sorption isotherms indicated that the soil had a higher affinity for PHA
   than for PFA. However, single component column transport experiments
   showed that PHA was less retarded than PFA. This anomaly was attributed
   to the size exclusion of the larger PHA molecules from the intraparticle
   porosity of the media under the geochemical conditions in the column. Pb
   retardation predicted by equilibrium equations based upon nonlinear
   isotherm parameterization agreed well with observed retardation.
   However, equilibrium retardation equations overpredicted retardation of
   DOM, indicating sorption kinetic Limitations (chemical and/or physical
   nonequilibrium), molecular size exclusion during column transport, or
   chemical heterogeneity of the DOM.
   In multicomponent column transport experiments, Pb retardation decreased
   by factors of 4-8 in the presence of DOM. Multicomponent batch
   equilibrium experiments suggested that Pb mobility was governed by
   speciation of Pb with soluble DOM during transport, Thus, Pb eluted
   earlier In the presence of PHA than in the presence of PHA than in the
   presence of PFA because PHA had a higher affinity for Pb binding than
   PFA. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Column experiments were conducted to evaluate the aqueous leachability
   of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from sludge-soil mixtures
   contaminated with PCBs and hydraulic oils, Untreated and biotreated
   sludge-soil samples were obtained from a two-month, pilot-scale field
   test of PCB biodegradation in land treatment units. Column leachate
   comprised mainly di-and trichlorobiphenyls, In comparison to untreated
   samples, column leachate from biotreated samples showed 34 to 63\%
   reduction in PCBs; average values of total PCB concentrations in the
   column effluent ranged from 0.36 to 0.82 mu gl(-1) for untreated samples
   and 0.25 to 0.30 mu gl(-1) for biotreated samples. Only a small
   fraction, less than 6\%, of the PCB mass in the untreated sludge-soil
   mixtures was removed by prolonged flushing with up to 2400-3000 pore
   volumes of water, suggesting long-term, slow release of PCBs at low
   aqueous concentrations. It should be noted that flushing rates for the
   column experiments were much higher than typical ground-water flow rates
   and the two-month period for column experiments can be qualitatively
   compared to a greatly extended duration for ground-water flow. The
   leaching of PCBs from a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) in the column
   experiments was modelled as a predominantly dissolution-governed process
   based on first-order kinetics. The estimated dissolution rate
   coefficients ranged from 0.02 to 0.04 min(-1) for various PCB homolog
   groups. This investigation helps support the concept of
   biostabilization, in which contaminated materials may be actively
   biotreated to remove the potentially mobile organic contaminants leaving
   a residual material that is more stable against leaching. Natural
   attenuation processes like sorption and intrinsic biodegradation further
   reduce the PCB leachability potential. Additional long-term monitoring
   of the land treatment units under passive conditions is under progress
   to evaluate such reductions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption onto five saturated soils of the homologs within the commercial
   surfactant mixture Brij 35 (registered trademark of ICI Americas) was
   investigated. Brij 35 is a mixture of linear ethoxylated alcohols,
   having an average of 23 ethoxy (EO) groups per molecule and alcohol
   chain of primarily 12 carbons in length (C12H25(OCH2CH2)(23)OH). In
   experiments, saturated soils were exposed to various concentrations of
   the surfactant mixture for specified times, the slurries were
   centrifuged to separate the phases, the aqueous phases were extracted
   with 1,2-dichloroethane, and the residual homologs were derivatized with
   3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride and analyzed by normal phase HPLC. Homologs
   containing 4-43 EO groups were chromatographically separated at near
   baseline. At aqueous Brij 35 concentrations below the critical micelle
   concentration (cmc), the proportion of each homolog sorbed to each of
   the soils increased with increasing EO chain length through the
   homologous series. As a result, in experiments where a significant
   proportion of the surfactant adsorbed, significant shifts in the aqueous
   phase compositions occurred to mixtures with lower mean EO numbers. A
   sharp break in the adsorption isotherms occurs at the cmc. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of environmental concern
   because many PAHs are either carcinogens or potential carcinogens.
   Petroleum products are a major source of PAHs. The occurrence of PAH
   contamination is widespread and novel treatment technologies for the
   remediation of contaminated soils are necessary.
   Ozone has been found to be extremely useful for the degradation of PAHs
   in soils. For these compounds, the reaction with molecular ozone appears
   to be the more important degradation pathway. Greater than 95\% removal
   of phenanthrene was achieved with an ozonation time of 2.3 h at an ozone
   flux of 250 mg h(-1). After 4.0 h of treatment at an ozone flux of 600
   mg h(-1), 91\% of the pyrene was removed. We have also found that the
   more hydrophobic PAHs (e.g. chrysene) react more slowly than would be
   expected on the basis of their reactivity with ozone, suggesting that
   partitioning of the contaminant into soil organic matter may reduce the
   reactivity of the compound. Even so, after 4 h of exposure to ozone, the
   chrysene concentration in a contaminated Metea soil was reduced from 100
   to 50 mgkg(-1).
   Ozone has been found to be readily transported through columns packed
   with a number of geological materials, including Ottawa sand, Metea
   soil, Borden aquifer material and Wurtsmith aquifer material. All of
   these geological materials exerted a limited (finite) ozone demand, i.e.
   the rate of ozone degradation in soil columns is very slow after the
   ozone demand is met. Moisture content was found to increase the ozone
   demand, most likely owing to the dissolution of gaseous ozone into the
   pore water. As once the initial ozone demand is met, little degradation
   of ozone is observed, it should be possible to achieve ozone penetration
   to a considerable distance away from the injection well, suggesting that
   in-situ ozonation is a feasible means of treating uncontaminated soils.
   This is substantiated by two field studies where in-situ ozonation was
   apparently successful at remediating the sites. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sorption of organic contaminants to soils has been shown to limit
   bioavailability and biodegradation in some systems. Use of surfactants
   has been proposed to reverse this effect. In this study, the effects of
   a high organic carbon content soil and a nonionic surfactant (Triton
   X-100) on the reductive dechlorination of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4),)
   were examined in anaerobic systems containing Shewanella putrefaciens.
   Although more than 70\% of the added CCl(4), was sorbed to the soil
   phase in these systems, the reductive dechlorination of CCl(4), was not
   diminished. Rather, rates of CCl(4), dechlorination in systems
   containing soil were enhanced relative to systems containing
   non-sorptive sand slurries. This enhancement was also observed in
   sterile soil slurries to which a chemical reductant, dithiothreitol was
   added. It appears that the organic soil used in these experiments
   contains some catalytic factor capable of transforming CCl(4), in the
   presence of an appropriate chemical or microbial reductant. The addition
   of Triton X-100 to sand and soil slurries containing S. putrefaciens
   resulted in increased CCl(4), degradation in both systems. The effect of
   Triton could not be explained by: (i) surfactant induced changes in the
   distribution of CCl(4), (i.e. decreased sorption) or the rate of CCl(4),
   desorption; (ii) a direct reaction between Triton and CCl(4),; or (iii)
   increased cell numbers resulting from use of the surfactant as a
   substrate. Rather, it appears that Triton X-100 addition resulted in
   lysis of bacterial cells, a release of biochemical reductant, and
   enhanced reductive transformation of CCl(4),. These results provide
   insights to guide the development of more effective direct or indirect
   bioremediation strategies. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to assess the nature of solute transport in
   peat by using step-inputs of a NaCl solution in laboratory columns of
   undisturbed peat. Feat has a dual-porosity matrix with inter-connected
   pores that actively transmit water, and dead-end and closed pores formed
   by the remains of plant cells. The proportion of dead-end and closed
   pores increased at depth, where the state of decomposition of organic
   material is more advanced. These dead-end and closed pores act as a sink
   for solute. Breakthrough at C/C-0 = 0.5 occurred much later than the
   total active pore volume in the column, indicating that solute
   retardation occurred. This retardation was attributed to diffusion of
   the flowing solute into the closed and dead-end pores (matrix
   diffusion). Greater retardation occurred at depth, increasing from 2.7
   at 0.20 m to 7.3 at 0.62 m, corresponding to the greater volume of
   closed and dead-end pores there. Retardation was also velocity
   dependent, with higher velocity resulting in less retardation of solute
   since there was less time available for solute to be abstracted from the
   flowing water into closed pores. Matrix diffusion was shown to enhance
   dispersion at lower flow velocities, and dispersion increased with
   depth. Feat effectively attenuated the conservative solute through
   matrix diffusion, and heterogeneity in peat properties influenced the
   effectiveness of this retardation. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Current methods of scaling imbibition and drainage pressure-saturation
   data scale the capillary pressure head using ratios of surface tension,
   constant intrinsic contact angle, fluid density difference and bubbling
   pressure. These methods are applicable to scaling either the main
   drainage or imbibition curve for different fluid pairs. However, for a
   given fluid pair, scaling of the drainage to the imbibition curve is
   generally unsatisfactory. For the drainage to imbibition case, the
   maximum error in computed saturations typically occurs at saturations
   representative of the funicular zone. It is proposed that an empirical
   functional relationship between advancing and receding apparent contact
   angles for a specific porous medium can be used to improve the scaling
   of imbibition to drainage pressure-saturation data for organic
   liquid-water systems. The Leverett J scaling function is modified by
   including the ratio of the apparent contact angles as a new scaling
   term. In the term cos (phi(R))/cos(phi(A))(p), the advancing apparent
   contact angle is first corrected for the combined effects of hysteresis
   and surface roughness by a constant exponent p. The exponent p is equal
   to the power of the fit of the advancing apparent contact angle, phi(A),
   to the receding apparent contact angle, phi(R). The magnitude of the
   correction appears to be a characteristic of the medium; however, more
   laboratory tests are needed for verification. The scaling procedure is
   tested for a limited series of fluid pairs in several porous media that
   are characterized by differing pore size distributions and granular
   compositions. The scaling technique is inadequate, however, for systems
   subjected to forced imbibition. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing concern about dangerous levels of bacterial
   contamination of rural ground water resources in Ontario and throughout
   the world. Recent studies in rural parts of Canada have identified
   leaching bed systems as one of the major sources of this contamination.
   Field studies were undertaken to evaluate bacterial contamination from
   three different types of leaching bed designs, using nalidixic
   acid-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli NAR) as a biotracer. This
   biotracer was used rather than passive ground water sampling to clearly
   identify the source of the contamination and also to allow the
   determination of travel times and distances more clearly. While this
   biotracer has been used for other studies its use in actual working
   septic systems has not yet been reported.
   This work has also shown that E. coli NAR is an excellent biotracer and
   can be used to give an accurate assessment of a leaching bed's
   performance provided it is introduced into the system over a reasonable
   period of time. Results also show that bacteria are not necessarily
   removed before the effluent reaches the ground water. The speed,
   distance of travel and attenuation of biotracer concentrations was found
   to be highly related to precipitation events, age of system and depth of
   unsaturated zone below the bed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{As an extension to the traditional dual-porosity approach, a
   triple-porosity model is presented to study the solute transport in
   heterogeneous porous media where the transport processes are distinctly
   different between macropores, mesopores and micropores. The distinctions
   in terms of conductance and storage in the respective pore domain are
   characterized by the fact that: (a) macropores are primary Bow paths
   where both dispersion and convection are prevalent; (b) mesopores are
   intermediate flow paths where convection becomes dominant and (c)
   micropores are supplemental flow paths and mass storage spaces where
   only diffusive flow is manifested. In cascading coupling, the solute
   interchange between micropores and mesopores is maintained by assuming
   micropore diffusion as internal sources (sinks) attached to mesopore
   skins. A comprehensive solute exchange between macropores and mesopores
   is preserved. A mathematical model is constructed in accordance with the
   physical conceptualization. The coupled partial differential equations
   are solved in a one-dimensional geometry using Laplace transform, and
   the subsequent coupled ordinary differential equations are circumvented
   via the method of differential operators. Semi-analytical solutions are
   obtained. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the potential effectiveness of kaolin clay liners in storage
   of fluoride contaminated waste, an experimental study of the sorption
   and desorption behaviour of fluoride in kaolin clay was conducted. The
   degree of fluoride sorption by kaolin was found to depend on solution pH
   and available fluoride concentration with equilibrium being achieved
   within 24 h. A site activation process involving the uptake of fluoride
   was also observed at the initial stages of sorption. This behaviour was
   attributed to a layer expansion process of the clay during sorption. The
   maximum fluoride sorption capacity was found to be 18.3 meq/100 g at pH
   6 and 8.6 meq/100 g at pH 7. A competitive Langmuir sorption isotherm
   where sorption is dependant on both pH and fluoride concentration is
   employed to characterise the experimental sorption and desorption data.
   The sorption and desorption isotherms revealed pronounced hysteretic
   behaviour. The model fitting experimental results suggests that 75\% of
   fluoride sorbed is irreversibly bound. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The role of overland flow dynamics on the lateral transport of
   soil-dissolved chemicals toward an outlet is studied herein using the
   solutions of the mass conservation equations for overland flow and
   transport. The transfer of soil chemicals to the overland flow is a
   rate-limited process proportional to the chemical concentration at the
   soil surface which is time dependent. Some simplifying conditions are
   considered, to develop an analytical solution for both equations. The
   rainfall rate f, the infiltration rate i, and the mass transfer
   coefficient k are assumed constant. The analytical solution is based on
   the characteristic method for the two main stages of overland flow,
   namely, the rising and falling stages. The first stage occurs from
   pending time to the time when rainfall ceases, at which point the second
   stage begins. During the second stage, the slope drains and overland
   flow depth gradually becomes zero. Although the initial water depth for
   the kinematic wave equation, h(0), could be chosen arbitrarily, its
   combination with the solute equation requires that h(0) should be
   greater than zero, since a singularity is obtained for h(0) = 0.
   Therefore, the solution for overland flow is developed for a general
   constant initial water depth, but in order to meet real initial
   conditions, h(0) is chosen to be very small, almost negligible. Use of
   the characteristic method imposes different solutions for each sub-zone
   that composes the domain. In one sub-zone that belongs to the falling
   stage, the characteristic curve is solved by Euler's method. During the
   rising stage of overland flow the concentration hydrograph decreases
   rapidly followed by a moderate decrease thereafter. During the falling
   stage of overland flow, the concentration hydrograph increases
   gradually. Since here the soil surface concentration is a function of
   time, the relative influence of the different rate-limited processes
   determining the shape of the concentration distribution at the slope
   outlet can be identified and analyzed. At time of pending and during the
   final period of overland flow recession, the assumption of constant k is
   not valid and, although mathematically correct, physically erroneous
   results are obtained. As an example, the analytical solution for
   c(s)(t), as obtained by Wallach and van Genuchten (1990), is introduced
   into the solution and the overland flow concentration distributions at
   the slope outlet were compared and successfully agreed with measured
   data. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into the fate and transport of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) in the subsurface requires the consideration of
   contaminant mass in both the aqueous and soil gas phases. As a result of
   water/gas phase partitioning, contaminated soil gas can act as a source
   of ground water pollution. Conversely, soil gas can be contaminated by
   partitioning from underlying ground water VOC plumes. This soil gas and
   aqueous phase interaction has motivated the popularity of soil gas
   sampling technology as a method of characterizing ground water VOC
   contamination.
   A finite-element-based numerical model was developed to accurately
   simulate the interaction between the soil gas phase and the aqueous
   phase. This interaction is complicated since the saturation of the
   aqueous phase varies dramatically across the capillary fringe. The
   two-phase flow equations for gas and water are used to describe the flow
   regime, while the advective-dispersive transport of the VOC is
   considered in both phases. Dissolution and volatilization from a
   non-mobile non-aqueous phase liquid is included as a volatile organic
   contaminant source. A deforming mesh allows the model to accurately
   track the water table movement, and a Eularian-Lagrangian formulation is
   used to control some of the numerical difficulties associated with the
   numerical solution of the advection-dispersion equation.
   An investigation into diffusion of a VOC from below the water table
   demonstrated that both the frequency and the magnitude of water table
   fluctuations have a profound influence on the degree of soil gas
   contamination.
   Two-dimensional large-scale, long-term simulations were performed to
   estimate the aqueous and soil gas phase plumes resulting from an
   immobilized trichloroethylene residual located in the unsaturated zone.
   The simulation results indicate that these plumes are very sensitive to
   the vertical position of the contaminant source. In addition, it was
   determined that seasonal fluctuations in soil gas VOC concentrations are
   primarily controlled by temperature fluctuations, while ground water VOC
   concentration fluctuations are primarily a result of infiltration
   fluctuations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{An experimental method has been developed to quantify helium molecular
   diffusion through water-saturated rocks. The procedure is based on the
   through diffusion method classically used for diffusion experiments. The
   first main improvement consists of the ability to control more
   environmental parameters close to the in-situ conditions than
   previously. The sample is subjected to stable temperature conditions
   (from 30 to 80 +/- 1 degrees C), total isotropic stress (from 5 to 20
   +/- 0.5 MPa) and pore water pressure (from 1 to 5 +/- 0.2 MPa). The
   water saturated state of the sample is controlled using permeability
   measurements and maintained throughout the experiment. A second
   important improvement is owing to the development of a numerical
   simulation and a new procedure for analysing helium which permits the
   study of the initial transient phase of the diffusive transfer. This
   procedure is based on helium leak detection using mass-spectrometry. A
   diffusion experiment performed on a clayey-marl specimen from
   Callovo-Oxfordian sediments in the north-east of the Parisian basin
   constitutes a significant test of the method. According to the results,
   an apparent diffusion coefficient as small as 2 X 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) can
   be determined within a month, using a 1 cm thick sample. (C) 1997

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{95-114}},

Abstract = {{Solute transport in a parallel plate fracture is simulated using a
   random walk model which accounts explicitly for sorption onto the
   fracture walls. With the hypothesis that solute must move into the
   vicinity of the fracture wall in order to participate in the sorption
   process, three implications follow. (1) In comparison to a nonreactive
   solute, a sorbing solute requires a greater entrance length along the
   fracture before transverse homogenization is established. The increase
   in this entrance length is proportional to the surface retardation
   factor. (2) At short transport distances, surface sorption leads to a
   high degree of non-uniform retardation. The transport distance required
   to establish uniform retardation of the entire solute mass varies
   greatly with geometric conditions and sorption strength. (3) Surface
   sorption results in enhanced longitudinal spreading of the solute mass
   in transport regimes which favor advective transport along the fracture
   relative to transverse diffusion across the fracture aperture. At
   distances greater than that required for transverse homogenization, an
   effective longitudinal dispersion coefficient can be defined that
   describes this enhanced dispersion for a wide range of fluid velocities.
   The magnitude of enhanced dispersion increases with sorption strength.

Title = {{Nonideal transport of reactive solutes in heterogeneous porous media -
   2. Quantitative analysis of the Borden natural-gradient field experiment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments constitute an integral component of research on
   transport and fate of contaminants in the subsurface. One of the most
   well known of the few field experiments performed with reactive solutes
   is the natural-gradient experiment conducted at the Borden site during
   1982 to 1984. A major finding of the experiment was that the transport
   of the reactive, organic compounds was nonideal. First, the velocities
   of the centers of mass of the plumes decreased with time, which was
   reflected in a temporal increase in effective retardation. Second, the
   longitudinal spreading observed for the organic solutes was about three
   times larger than that of the nonreactive tracers for an equivalent
   travel distance. Third, the breakthrough curves measured at selected
   monitoring points exhibited greater asymmetry compared to the
   nonreactive tracers. The cause(s) of the nonideal transport observed for
   the organic solutes has remained unexplained, despite a number of
   attempts. We have used a multi-scale, multi-factor mathematical model to
   successfully predict the displacement and spreading behavior of the
   tetrachloroethene and tetrachloromethane plumes. Based on our analyses,
   we conclude that a near-field trend of increasing sorption capacity was
   a primary cause of the deceleration of the centers of mass of the
   organic-solute plumes. The coupled effects of nonlinear sorption and
   enhanced spreading caused by spatially variable hydraulic conductivity
   and spatially variable sorption also influenced plume displacement. In
   addition, it is possible that the combination of spatially variable
   hydraulic conductivity and sorption contributed directly to plume
   deceleration. However, a magnitude of sorption variability larger than
   has been measured to date is required for this contribution to be
   significant. The combined spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity
   and sorption, and a potential negative cross correlation between them,
   appears to have been the major cause of the enhanced longitudinal
   spreading observed for the organic-solute plumes in comparison to the
   nonreactive-solute plumes. However, nonlinear sorption, the spatial
   trend of increasing sorption capacity, and rate-limited sorption/mass
   transfer also influenced spreading behavior. In total, it is evident
   that the transport of the organic compounds during the Borden
   natural-gradient field experiment was influenced by several interacting
   factors and coupled processes, and that accurate prediction of the
   observed behavior requires the use of a mathematical model that accounts
   for this complexity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of these experiments was to study the effects of physical
   heterogeneity and velocity on transport of gas-phase contaminants in dry
   porous media. Experiments were conducted at gas velocities ranging from
   6 to 200 cm min(-1) to examine the contributions of longitudinal
   molecular diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, and rate-limited diffusive
   mass transfer to solute spreading. Methane was used as a nonreactive
   tracer, and trichloroethene, benzene and toluene were used as reactive
   tracers. Total dispersion of methane during transport through a
   homogeneous porous medium was the sum of longitudinal molecular
   diffusion and hydrodynamic dispersion. The latter was the major process
   contributing to total dispersion at gas velocities greater than 40 cm
   min(-1). The contribution of longitudinal molecular diffusion was
   negligible at gas velocities greater than 150 cm min(-1). Transport of
   tracers in the heterogeneous (macroporous) medium exhibited preferential
   flow and tailing at gas velocities greater than about 100 cm min(-1) as
   a result of rate-limited mass transfer between macropore and micropore
   domains. The spreading associated with rate-limited mass transfer
   between macropore and micropore domains was the main contributor to
   total dispersion at gas velocities greater than 120 cm min(-1). The
   transport of the reactive tracers was successfully predicted using data
   obtained for the nonreactive tracer. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Specification of relative permeability (k(r))-saturation (S) relations
   for all fluid phases is required for the simulation of multiphase flow
   and transport in porous media. Indirect methods are frequently employed
   to estimate these k(r)-S relations owing to the time, expense, and
   difficulty associated with direct measurements. A common indirect
   approach uses capillary pressure data in conjunction with a selected
   pore-size distribution model to estimate k(r)-S relations. Such methods
   typically assume perfect wettability of the solid. Natural porous media,
   however, are composed of a variety of mineral constituents with
   different adsorptive properties, which can exhibit non-zero contact
   angles and/or fractional wettability. Consequently, fluid distributions
   in natural media may be more complex than those predicted by simple
   pore-size distribution models and, under such conditions, current
   estimation approaches for k(r) may be inadequate. In this work, the
   pore-size distribution model of N.T. Burdine (1953, Relative
   permeability calculations from pore-size distribution data. Transactions
   of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum
   Engineers 198, 71-77) is extended to incorporate wettability variations.
   In this model, wetting and less wetting (non-wetting or intermediate)
   fluid pore classes are used to calculate k(r) for water or organic. The
   wettability of the porous medium is used to determine the contributions
   of the pore classes to k(r). For both two-and three-fluid systems, the
   model predicts that an increase in the contact angle (measured through
   water) or organic-wet fraction of a medium will be accompanied by an
   increase in the water k(r) and a decrease in the organic k(r). In
   three-fluid media, k(r) values for water and organic depend on both
   liquid saturations when the solid is imperfectly wetted. The model
   assumes that wettability variation has no influence on the air k(r).
   Model predictions are shown to be consistent with available experimental
   data. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional model for the migration of colloids in a saturated
   fracture is presented, which considers the motion of colloids as a
   result of advection and diffusion, as well as colloid-surface
   interactions at the fracture walls. This model is successfully
   incorporated into a three-dimensional particle tracking algorithm that
   tracks particles within a continuum and allows consideration of the
   migration of colloids in symmetrical, three-dimensional, non-uniform
   fractures. The framework is general enough to incorporate non-local
   interactions that provide colloid motion relative to the fluid. The
   algorithm is verified against classical Taylor dispersion, and its
   generalization to a sorbing phase, in a uniform fracture and shows
   excellent agreement with theory. A simple, non-uniform fracture that has
   an analytically tractable velocity field is also considered, and both
   quantitative and qualitative comparisons are made with the uniform
   fracture case. The modelling of more complex fracture geometries is also
   discussed and a particular case is implemented within the particle
   tracking framework. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Semiconfined aquifers used as the principal water supply within the
   Basin of Mexico are overlain by lacustrine deposits that provide a
   degree of protection from contamination associated with metropolitan
   Mexico City. Solute transport behavior and the nature of chemical
   interactions with mineral components in these sediments is poorly
   understood. The objectives of this paper were to identify the clay
   mineral phases of the lacustrine sediments and to determine the
   significance of the exchange properties of the day minerals on
   contaminant transport processes. Samples obtained from two cores were
   separated into sand, silt, and clay-size fractions. The clay-size
   fraction was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy and for specific surface area and pH-dependent
   cation and anion exchange capacity. The clay-sized fraction averaged
   56\% of the sediment. Analyses indicated that the clay was predominantly
   composed of a Si-rich allophane with approximately 30\% montmorillonite.
   Halloysite was also present to a depth of about 1.5 m, but was absent
   deeper in the sediment. Kaolinite and illite, reported in previous
   studies, and imogolite were not found in the samples. Solute transport
   in the sediment was modeled to demonstrate the impact of exchange
   properties imparted by the allophane compared to other possible clay
   mineral assemblages. The predominance of allophane in the Basin of
   Mexico sediments is responsible for many of the fundamental
   characteristics of the material including: high porosity (0.8-0.9), high
   water content (200-400\%), and an extremely high and ps-dependent cation
   exchange capacity. The pH of the pore water within the lacustrine
   sediments of the Basin of Mexico is typically between 6.5 and 12.
   Measured cation exchange values ranged from approximate to 450 meq
   kg(-1) at pH 6.5 to approximate to 650 meq kg(-1) at pH 12 which could
   produce variable cation mobility in the semiconfining aquitard. The
   simulations illustrated that allophane is very effective for retarding
   the leaching of cationic metals compared to other possible clay mineral
   suites, particularly at high pH values. Simulation of long-term
   infiltration indicated that trace metals will become concentrated in the
   clay matrix adjacent to fracture facts in the sediment near ground
   surface. As such, the aquitard behaves as an efficient barrier to the
   infiltration of cationic metals into the underlying aquifer. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{In this paper experimental investigations into the acid/base titration
   characteristics of Na-montmorillonite and the sorption behaviour of Ni
   and Zn under a wide variety of conditions are presented. From these
   measurements the dominant sorption mechanisms could be deduced. In the
   following paper (Bradbury and Baeyens, 1997) the titration and sorption
   data are analysed to determine the parameters in cation exchange and
   surface complexation based models which together provide a quantitative
   description of the titration and sorption data.
   A conditioning procedure was applied to the SWy-1 Na-montmorillonite
   starting material in order to remove background metal impurities,
   soluble salts and sparingly soluble minerals which could influence
   titration and sorption measurements. The purified clay, in the
   homo-ionic Na form, was thoroughly physico-chemically characterised
   before carrying out batch titration measurements on suspensions in 0.1
   and 0.5 M NaClO4. The influence of background impurities, not removed by
   the conditioning, and cation exchange processes on the form of the
   titration curves is discussed. Titration data can be analysed to yield
   site capacities and protonation/deprotonation constants for the
   amphoteric surface hydroxyl groups (=SOH). The acid endpoint in the
   titration data was used to estimate an =SOH site capacity of 0.08 mol
   kg(-1).
   The sorption of Ni and Zn on conditioned Na-montmorillonite was studied
   at trace concentrations as a function of pH over a range from similar to
   3 to similar to 10 to produce so-called `'sorption edges''. In the case
   of Ni, such measurements were carried out as a function of the NaClO4
   background electrolyte concentration. In addition, sorption isotherms
   were determined for both nuclides at several fixed pH values in 0.1 M
   NaClO4. From the form of the `'edges'' it was deduced that two main
   sorption mechanisms were controlling the uptake of Ni and Zn onto the
   clay mineral; a pa-independent component, identified as cation exchange
   on the permanent charge sites, and a pH-dependent one, interpreted as
   surface complexation on the amphoteric surface hydroxyl groups. The
   non-linearity of the sorption isotherms indicated that at least two
   different =SOH type sites were contributing to the overall sorption on
   Na-montmorillonite. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Titration and sorption edge/isotherm measurements, carried out under a
   wide variety of conditions on Na-montmorillonite, were reported in Part
   I (Baeyens and Bradbury, 1997). These data are modelled here in terms of
   cation exchange and surface complexation mechanisms using a computer
   code called MINSORB. This code allowed the uptake of radionuclides by
   both mechanisms to be calculated simultaneously; also taking into
   account competitive reactions from other cations present. A stepwise
   iterative fitting/modelling procedure is described. For the case of
   Na-montmorillonite it is demonstrated that an electrostatic term in the
   surface complexation model is not required. From the modelling of the
   titration results, values for site capacities and
   protonation/deprotonation constants were deduced. These values were then
   fixed and used in all further surface complexation modelling of the
   sorption measurements. The main study was carried out with Ni, but
   impurity cations present in the system, particularly Zn, had to be
   examined in addition due to their competitive effects on Ni sorption.
   The surface complexation behaviour of Ni and Zn was investigated in
   detail to give intrinsic surface complexation constants on two of the
   =SOH type sites included in the model. The sorption of Mn is also
   considered, though in less detail, and estimated surface complexation
   constants for this element are presented. Cation exchange was included
   in all of the calculations. Measured selectivity coefficients for Ni-Na
   and Zn-Na exchange reactions are given. The model, with the derived
   parameters, allowed all the experimental data from titration
   measurements through sorption edges to sorption isotherms to be
   quantitatively described. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   groundwater. The data suggest both point and non-point sources of
   groundwater pollution. Thirty-three percent of the groundwater samples
   showed nitrate contents exceeding the general acceptable Limit of 20
   p.p.m. and 15\% of the samples crossed the maximum permissible limit of
   45 p.p.m. High nitrate levels are associated with high delta(18)O
   values, clearly indicating that significant quantities of evaporated
   (isotopically enriched) irrigation water infiltrate along with
   fertilizer nitrate to the groundwater system. Different delta(18)O-NO3-
   trends suggest isotopically distinct, non-point source origins which
   vary spatially and temporally, due to different degrees of
   evaporation/recharge and amounts of fertilizer applied. A scatter
   diagram of NO3- vs K+ suggests a common source of these ions when the
   concentration is less than 40 p.p.m. The investigation indicates that a
   combination of isotope (O-18) and hydrochemical data can clearly
   characterize the impact of fertilizer on groundwater. Application of
   high nitrate, high potassium groundwater irrigation can minimize the
   requirement for inorganic fertilizers and bring down the cost of
   cultivation considerably, through appropriate management of fertilizer
   and water and modifications in agronomic practices and strategies on
   crops grown. Such practices will help protect groundwater from further
   degradation. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Some results from numerical models of flow and contaminant transport in
   fractured permeable rocks, where fractures are more conductive than rock
   matrix, are described. The 2D flow field in the fractured and permeable
   rock matrix is calculated using a finite difference, `conductance mesh'
   method, and the contaminant transport is simulated by particle tracking
   methods using an advection-biased, random walk technique. The model is
   applied to simulated and naturally occurring fracture patterns. The
   simulated pattern is an en echelon array of unconnected fractures, as an
   example of st common, naturally occurring fracture geometry. Two natural
   fracture patterns are used: one of unconnected, sub-parallel fractures
   and one with oblique fracture sets which is well connected. Commonly
   occurring matrix permeability and fracture aperture values are chosen.
   The simulations show that the presence of fractures creates complex and
   heterogeneous flow fields and contaminant distribution in the permeable
   rock matrix. The modelling results have shown that some effects are
   non-intuitive and therefore difficult to foresee without the help of a
   model. With respect to contaminant transport rates and plume
   heterogeneity, it was found that fracture connectivity (crucial when the
   matrix is impermeable) can play a secondary role to fracture orientation
   and density. Connected fracture systems can produce smooth break-through
   curves of contaminants summed over, for example, a bore-hole length,
   whereas in detail the contaminant plume is spatially highly
   heterogeneous. Close to a constant-pressure boundary (e.g. an extraction
   bore-hole), flow and contaminants can be channelled by fractures. Thus
   observations at a bore-hole may suggest that contaminants are largely
   confined to the fracture system, when, in fact, significant
   contamination resides in the matrix. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Soil heating has been proposed as a method to enhance the vapor
   extraction of NAPLs from contaminated soils. Three-dimensional fluid
   flow and heat transfer simulations have been per formed for soil-heated
   vapor extraction to determine the transient system performance for a
   hypothetical configuration. Soil layering has been considered in
   evaluation of the initial non-aqueous phase Liquid (NAPL) distribution
   and in evaporation and transport to the vapor extraction location.
   Results from this layered model are compared with results for a
   homogeneous system with an initially uniform NAPL, indicating the
   influence of layering, the initial NAPL distribution, the type of NAPL,
   and the possibility of enhanced vapor diffusion. Not only is the NAPL
   removal. time reduced significantly with the addition of heat, but the
   uncertainty in the removal time owing to a number of difficult to
   characterize in situ factors, such as layering and the initial NAPL
   distribution, is much less than for standard soil vapor extraction
   without heating, owing to the rise in temperature and increase in NAPL
   vapor pressure with time. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a two-dimensional mathematical solute transport model is
   proposed to simulate the leaching of copper ore tailings using sulfuric
   acid as the leaching agent, injection wells to introduce the leaching

   To calibrate the model, a tracer experiment and a leaching experiment
   were performed, both under conditions of a single-direction flow pattern
   established between two boundaries of constant height. These experiments
   enabled the model hydraulic, dispersion and reaction parameters to be
   determined. Validation of the model was performed by comparison of the
   numerical results given by the model with experimental results obtained
   from a second leaching experiment, performed under conditions of a
   radial flow pattern established through the use of four injection wells
   and one pumping well and making use of the parameters estimated
   previously during the calibration process, The comparison between
   predicted and measured leaching behavior was good (20-22\% error). The

Abstract = {{Diffusion is fundamental in controlling movement of organic contaminants
   in clay textured materials. Diffusion coefficients for 1-napthol and
   naphthalene were measured for a weathered shale based on the
   breakthrough time and on the steady state flux of solute through the
   clay barrier. Steady state solute flux through the clay barrier was 9 to
   35 times lower than that predicted based on breakthrough diffusion
   coefficients within the clay barrier. Analysis of napthalene
   concentration in the pore solution of a non-sorbing medium
   (montmorillonite clay) showed that the solute concentration in the clay
   pores was only 40\% of that in the free solution suggesting that the
   clay barrier was restricting the entry of the solute into the clay pore
   space. Results suggest that the clay can act to exclude the diffusing
   species from the pore space, reducing the effective solute concentration
   gradient within the clay cell. This will act to further enhance the
   ability of clay materials to limit contaminant flux. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The simulation of pollutant transport in groundwater requires the
   numerical solution of the advection-dispersion equation. Until now the
   main difficulty in solving this equation was to satisfy the
   discretization requirements which guaranteed a reasonably accurate
   solution. In the paper a new algorithm (named the front limitation
   algorithm) is demonstrated which avoids most of the difficulties, The
   technique makes use of the control volume method with fully implicit
   diffusion-dispersion and source-sink terms and with explicit handling of
   the advection term. The new algorithm avoids numerical dispersion. The
   method fulfils the mass balance in each grid element. Neither a grid
   Peclet number criterion nor the Neumann criterion are required. The
   method has little grid orientation effect. It, however, requires a low
   Courant number and time step criteria with respect to source-sink terms.
   The new method was verified in 1D, 2D and 3D cases with analytical
   solutions and with random walk simulation runs. It allows to work with
   relatively coarse grids and is therefore well-suited for parameter
   identification and optimal control problems, where a model has to be
   solved many times in a row. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solutions are developed for modeling solute transport in a
   vertical section of a homogeneous aquifer with steady uniform
   groundwater flow. The source is assumed to be located at the top (or the
   bottom) of the aquifer, and the initial concentration is assumed to be
   zero everywhere in the aquifer. Both constant-flux and
   constant-concentration sources are treated. For cases of a constant-flux
   source, we present exact analytical solutions considering the following
   transport mechanisms: advection in the horizontal direction, dispersions
   in both horizontal and vertical directions, adsorption, and
   biodegradation. For cases of a constant-concentration source, we present
   simplified analytical solutions by neglecting dispersion in the
   horizontal direction. For both kinds of sources, the solutions for
   aquifers with a relatively large or small thickness are presented and
   compared. The solutions for the two different source conditions are also
   compared for similar cases. The comparisons indicate that simpler
   solutions, used in appropriate cases, can give the same results as those
   given by more complex solutions. Example calculations are given to show
   the movement of the contamination front, the steady-state concentration
   profiles, and the applications to determine dispersivities. The
   analytical solutions developed in this study can be useful in site
   characterization, groundwater monitoring, and remediation. Published by

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the fluid-fluid and fluid-solid interfacial areas is
   important to better understand and quantify many flow and transport
   processes in porous media. This paper presents estimates for interfacial
   areas of porous media containing two or three fluids from measured
   capillary pressure (P-c)-saturation (S) relations. The thermodynamic
   treatment of two-fluid P-c-S relations presented by Morrow (1970) served
   as the basis for the predictions. In media containing two fluids
   (air-oil, air-water, oil-water), the solid-nonwetting interfacial area
   (A(sN){*}) equaled zero when the solid was completely wetted by the
   wetting fluid. The area under the P-c-S curve was directly proportional
   to the nonwetting-wetting interfacial area (A(NW){*}). If the solid
   surface was not completely wetted by one fluid, A(NW){*} and A(sN){*}
   were estimated by weighed partitioning of the area under the P-c-S
   curve. For porous media with fractional wettability, the procedure was
   applied separately to water- and oil-wet regions. The values of A(NW){*}
   and A(sN){*} were highest and lowest, respectively, in systems that were
   strongly wetted. In three-fluid media the wetting and spreading behavior
   of the liquids greatly affected the estimated interfacial areas. For a
   water-wet medium with a continuous intermediate oil phase, the
   interfacial areas were predicted from P-c-S data in a similar manner as
   for two-fluid media. The oil-water and oil-solid interfacial areas were
   estimated from the oil-water P-c-S curve, while the air-oil interfacial
   area was obtained from the air-oil P-c-S curve. For a fractional
   wettability or oil-wet medium there may be as many as six interfaces.
   These interfacial areas were estimated from three-fluid P-c-S relations
   based on previously developed methods for predicting three-fluid P-c-S
   relations from two-fluid data. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper applies fuzzy sets and fuzzy arithmetic to incorporate
   imprecise information into transport modeling of nonreactive solute
   materials in groundwater flow. The method is applied to both one- and
   two-dimensional uniform flow fields. Emphasis is on the solution methods
   of the fuzzy numerical model of solute transport, which is a function of
   fuzzy variables. The solution techniques, including the vertex method
   and the fuzzy-numerical simulation method (i.e. the single-value
   simulation method), are discussed in detail. The solute concentration
   outputs from the fuzzy finite-difference numerical models based on these
   two solution methods are compared with those from the fuzzy analytical
   models. The vertex method can avoid the widening of the fuzzy function
   value set, in this case, the fuzzy solute concentration function. This
   widening is due to multi-occurrence of variables in the function
   expression when using conventional interval analysis. However, in fuzzy
   finite-difference numerical simulation of solute transport. the vertex
   method may still overestimate the uncertainty in the concentration
   outputs since all the fuzzy variables in the fuzzy numerical model are
   taken to be independent. The fuzzy-numerical simulation method can
   control the growth of the imprecision in the solute concentration
   calculations by taking into account the interaction (dependence) of
   concentration variables in both space and time dimensions in the fuzzy
   finite-difference model of solute transport. It has the advantage of
   allowing the use of imprecise data for modeling and also processing the
   fuzzy information using generated crisp values of fuzzy variables. The
   adoption of fuzzy sets allows common-sense knowledge to be represented
   in defining values through the use of a membership function. This
   enables the subjective information to be incorporated in system modeling
   in a formal algorithm. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to measure flow of a light,
   non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL or simply `'oil'') in porous media. The
   objective of these experiments was to measure oil recovery as influenced
   by hysteresis, the oil-water capillary fringe, and an oil seepage face.
   Oil was infiltrated and allowed to redistribute across the horizontal
   length of a two-dimensional tank filled with medium sand. The first
   experiment involved oil recovery without water pumping, while the second
   experiment involved oil recovery with water pumping to increase the
   gradient toward the recovery well. Observed oil recovery compared
   favorably with the predictions of a numerical model (ARMOS). A
   dual-energy gamma radiation attenuation system monitored oil and water
   saturations throughout the experiments, while hydrophobic tensiometers
   measured the location of the air-oil table (Z(ao)). The experimental
   distribution of oil saturations suggested the need to incorporate an
   oil-water capillary fringe in the calculation of oil trapping in the
   saturated zone. Measurements of Z(ao) indicated that hysteresis
   influenced the liquid saturation-pressure relationships. When the
   effects of hysteresis were incorporated into the model, predicted and
   measured values of Z(ao) came into agreement, especially at early times
   during the recovery process. Experimental data also suggested the
   presence of an oil seepage face at the pumping well, but model results
   were not sensitive to this factor. Oil saturation measurements at later
   times suggested that the oil may have experienced delayed yield, an
   effect that was not modeled explicitly. A sensitivity analysis revealed
   that oil recovery predictions were most affected by horizontal hydraulic
   conductivity, fluid scaling parameters beta(ao) and beta(ow), and van
   Genuchten alpha, n, and S-m. Overall, the numerical model appeared to
   match measured data for oil saturation, pressure, and recovery under two
   sets of boundary conditions. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of natural geological and archaeological systems as analogues to
   long-term processes, which are predicted to occur within a radioactive
   waste repository environment, have become increasingly popular over the
   last 10 years or so, to the extent that such studies form an integral
   part of many national programmes for radioactive waste disposal. There
   is now a common consensus that the natural analogue approach is a very
   useful scientific methodology to: (a) identify and understand processes
   and mechanisms analogous to those which could occur in the vicinity of a
   repository over realistic timescales, (b) derive input data which have
   been successfully used to test some of the laboratory-based models which
   form the basis of long-term repository performance assessment, and (c)
   to produce data which can be input directly to performance assessment
   models. Increasingly, analogues are playing an important role in public
   awareness, enabling the layman to understand better the concept of
   radioactive disposal and demonstrating the reliability of the disposal
   system over long periods of geological time.
   The complexity of geological systems means that it is very often
   difficult and sometimes impossible to quantify precisely the
   physico-chemical boundary conditions necessary to model a particular
   geochemical process or mechanism. Consequently, the availability of
   quantitative analogue data is Limited when repository performance
   assessments are considered. However, this in no way detracts from their
   value in building confidence by demonstrating that important processes
   do exist and by showing qualitatively that they behave in a way
   predicted by models based on laboratory-derived data.
   The transfer of natural analogue data from the complexity of field
   studies to simplistic models which, by necessity, are used in
   performance assessments, is an area of activity which is presently being
   addressed. Field analogue studies are now being planned to interface
   with laboratory experiments and, ultimately, with in situ field
   experiments. This is a promising avenue of research which should provide
   a more quantitative use of natural analogue data in testing and further
   developing models used in (or supporting) repository performance
   assessments. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, we have been building up the thermodynamic and kinetic
   basis necessary to quantitatively determine the pathway for the
   long-term oxidative alteration of the UO2 spent fuel matrix. There is a
   need to complement our thermodynamic description of these processes with
   kinetic mass transfer models. The development of these kinetic mass
   transfer models to the long-term oxidative alteration of UO2 has been
   recently illustrated. The Cigar Lake ore deposit constitutes a unique
   opportunity to test the validity of these alteration models, since they
   provide the appropriate time and space scales. The purpose of this paper
   will be to show the successful testing of equilibrium and kinetic mass
   transfer models to describe the long-time-low temperature evolution of
   the uraninite deposit and the contacting groundwaters. In this paper, we
   will discuss the basic kinetics and thermodynamics of the model as well
   as the encouraging results so far obtained. The kinetic model has been
   applied to the aluminosilicates system. The results show that the
   interactions with clay minerals control the bulk composition of
   groundwater, The kinetic approach is able to describe the evolution of
   the groundwater composition along the hydrogeological pathways studied.
   The uranium system has been modelled by simulating the dissolution of
   uraninite along the flowpaths investigated. This modelling is based on
   equilibrium assumptions. The evolution of the redox state of
   groundwaters along different flowpaths is well reproduced. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The applications of geochemical modelling to natural water systems
   mostly rely upon the equilibrium assumption. This is in principle
   justified for deep groundwater systems with long water residence times.
   In addition, trace element behaviour in these natural systems has been
   normally modelled by taking into account the precipitation and
   dissolution of individual trace element phases.
   Recent geochemical modelling work related to natural analogue systems
   would indicate that: (1) the equilibrium condition is restricted to a
   limited number of components in long water residence times and (2) the
   behaviour of trace metals is very much connected to the major component
   cycling in the system.
   There is a need to develop our geochemical modelling capabilities to
   take these two facts into account in order to be able to predict the
   behaviour of trace components (radionuclides) in a geological
   repository.
   In this work we report on the successful application of steady-state
   kinetics in conjunction with co-dissolution/co-precipitation approaches
   to model trace element geochemistry in the natural analogue system at El
   Berrocal. The evolution of major components of the system (Ca (II), Al
   (III), CO32- and Si) as well the trace elements investigated (U, Ba and
   Mn) is well reproduced by using the coupling between steady-state
   kinetics and co-dissolution/co-precipitation approaches. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The fracture fillings in the El Berrocal site are the result of several
   overlapping alteration processes of the granite since the formation of
   the fractures. They are essentially composed of quartz, feldspars, clay
   minerals, carbonates and minor pyrite and Fe oxyhydroxides. The U(IV)
   oxides occur only in some samples, whereas uranyl phosphates and
   silicates, sometimes with Th and REE, are present in almost all the
   samples, Adsorption and/or coprecipitation of U onto Fe oxyhydroxides
   were also observed, In relation to the granite, the fracture fillings
   are enriched in U by a factor ranging between 60 and 2, and in Th by a
   factor of 3.
   delta(18)O values in clay minerals, quartz and carbonates and delta(13)C
   in the latter indicate that quartz, illite and kaolinite were formed at
   a minimum temperature of 100 degrees C; the CO32-, of edaphic origin,
   was formed between 15 degrees C and at least 60 degrees C. Smectite and
   a second generation of kaolinite were formed at ambient temperature.
   Just under half of the bulk samples of the fracture fillings are in
   secular equilibrium with respect to U isotopes. The rest have at least
   one activity ratio less or larger than unity.
   The existence of uranyl minerals and the U-Th enrichment factors
   observed indicate retention processes mainly by precipitation of both
   natural radionuclides. The different values of the U-234/U-238 activity
   ratio observed show that fixation or leaching of U may be currently in
   progress at various locations in the fracture system. However, some
   samples in equilibrium for the U-234/U-238 pair are taking up Ra-228
   (Th-228) from the waters, whereas samples with U-234/U-238 not equal 1
   generally function as a close system for the Ra-228(Th-228)/Th-232 pair.
   This is consistent with the extremely open character of the site
   studied. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidation of pyrite at the Nopal I uranium deposit, Pena Blanca
   district, Chihuahua, Mexico has resulted in the formation of
   Fe-oxides/hydroxides. Anomalous U concentrations (i.e. several hundred
   to several thousand ppm) measured in goethite, hematite, and amorphous
   Fe-oxyhydroxides in a major fracture that crosscuts the deposit and the
   absence of U minerals in the fracture suggest that U was retained during
   secondary mineral growth or sorbed on mineral surfaces. Mobilization and
   transport of U away from the deposit is suggested by decreasing U
   concentrations in fracture-infilling materials and in goethite and
   hematite with distance from the deposit. Greater than unity U-234/U-238
   activity ratios measured in fracture-infilling materials indicate
   relatively recent (< 1 Ma) U uptake from fluids that carried excess
   U-234. Systematic decreases in U-234/U-238 activity ratios of fracture
   materials with distance from the deposit suggest a multistage
   mobilization process, such as remobilization of U from U-234-enriched
   infill minerals or differential or diminished transport of U-bearing
   solutions containing excess U-234. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Results are reported for a series of migration experiments performed in
   a hydraulically characterized, single, natural fracture in a block of
   granite with overall dimensions of 1 x 1 x 0.7 m (all approximate),
   using the conservative, poorly sorbing and strongly sorbing
   radionuclides (H2O)-H-3, I-131, Na-22, Sr-85, Cs-137, Co-60,
   Eu-154,Eu-155, Np-237, and Pu-238. The volumetric flow velocity of the
   transport solution was 3 ml h(-1), giving a residence time in the
   fracture of approximately 50 h. Elution profiles were obtained for
   (H2O)-H-3, I-131, Na-22, Sr-85 and Cs-137 but no evidence of the other
   radionuclides was observed in the eluent. Results from supporting static
   sorption measurements on crushed geological materials and granite
   coupons showed in general higher sorption on alteration minerals than on
   granite. Sorption was lowest for Na-22 and Sr-85.
   The migration of I-131, Na-22, Sr-85 through the fracture in real time
   was followed using end-window Geiger-Muller probes located in unused
   boreholes. Additional information, obtained by alpha and gamma scanning
   of the fracture surfaces after separating the block along the fracture,
   confirmed that transport had occurred along the flow path predicted from
   the hydraulic characterization of the fracture and that, over a 5.5
   month period, the bulk of the injected Cs-137 had migrated only 75 cm
   along the flow path. The Co-60, the rare earths and the actinides had
   not moved beyond the location of the injection borehole, suggesting that
   fracture infilling minerals played a major role in retarding
   radionuclide transport. Additional confirmation of the role of secondary
   minerals in radionuclide retardation was obtained using selective
   sequential extraction on the fracture surfaces. These observations
   support the inclusion of sorption data for fracture infilling minerals
   in the sorption database developed for the geosphere model for the
   Canadian Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Program. (C) 1997 Atomic Energy

Abstract = {{A transport model has been used to describe the migration of nonsorbing
   tracers in a non-uniform flow field in a natural fracture. A variable
   aperture channel model with particle tracking was used to characterize
   the aperture width of the fracture and to simulate solute transport.
   This model was validated using results obtained from a radionuclide
   migration experiment performed in a natural fracture in a quarried block
   of granite over a distance of 1 m. The hydraulic conductivity of the
   fracture was determined from the pressure differential required to
   maintain a given flow rate between pairs of boreholes. The results were
   used with a variable aperture channel model to map the aperture
   distribution. Pressure distribution and flow vector distribution are
   calculated for these experimental conditions. Groundwater containing
   (H2O)-H-3 and I-131 was injected into the fracture as a band at a flow
   rate of 3 ml h(-1). The movement of the plume through the fracture was
   monitored by Geiger-Muller probes inserted in the boreholes. The
   calculated results for the migration plume and elution profiles were
   compared with experimental results. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The effective diffusivity of uranium(VI) in Inada granite has been
   determined by through-diffusion. Experiments were performed at room
   temperature (20-25 degrees C) in a 0.1 mol l(-1) KCl solution where
   uranium is present predominantly as the poorly sorbing UO22+. An
   effective diffusivity (D-e) of (3.6 +/- 1.6) x 10(-14) m(2) s(-1) was
   obtained, close to that for uranine (nonsorbing organic tracer), but one
   order of magnitude lower than those obtained for Sr2+ and NpO2+, and two
   orders of magnitude lower than that obtained for I-. According to well
   established theory, a proportional relationship exists between D-e and
   the diffusivity in the bulk of the solution (D-v). The effective
   diffusivity obtained in granite was not proportional to D-v. This agrees
   with results obtained for effective diffusivity in a Swedish granite.
   The ratio D-e/D-v was found to be not constant but increased with D-e or
   D-v. This result suggests a limit to the application of the theory. (C)

Abstract = {{Through-diffusion experiments were carried out for Ca, Ni and Sm which
   can have a valence of I, II and III, respectively, through granodiorite,
   basalt and mudstone which have been considered candidates as natural
   barriers at 25 degrees C under ambient conditions, The tracer solution
   was prepared as a mixture of Ca, Ni and Sm. The experiments were
   continued for a maximum of 596 days. During the experiments, the pH was
   monitored. The tortuosities of the rocks were measured using a NaCl
   tracer and a through-diffusion method. The porosities, pore size
   distributions, specific surface area and dry densities of the rocks were
   measured by a water saturation method and a mercury porosimetry.
   Effective and apparent diffusion coefficients (epsilon Dp, Da) were
   obtained for each element. The epsilon Dp and Da values ranged from 0.57
   to 1.4 X 10(-12) and 1.0 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1) for granodiorite,
   respectively. Those for mudstone ranged from 0.53 to 4.8 X 10(-13) and
   from 2.6 to 3.9 X 10(-13) m(2) s(-1), respectively, and those for basalt
   ranged from 0.28 to 1.5 X 10(-13) and from 1.6 to 2.1 X 10(-13) s(-1),
   respectively. The epsilon Dp and Da values of Cs were the highest of the
   three elements for all rocks. Both diffusion coefficients for all
   elements were in the order: granodiorite > mudstone > basalt. The pore
   size was found to be relatively large for each rock compared with the
   ionic radius. The epsilon Dp values were predicted, based on the
   formation factors by taking into account the porosity and tortuosity.
   The predicted values were in relatively good agreement with the measured
   values with deviations of less than about five times. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The matrix diffusion of non-sorbing tracers was studied in rocks from
   the Syyry area, Central Finland (SY1). The effect of alteration and
   weathering on rock matrix porosity and on the available pore space,
   which affects diffusivity, are discussed. The main rock type in the
   crystalline bedrock of Syyry is a slightly foliated, gray tonalite with
   mica gneiss inclusions as well as minor, more mafic inclusions. The
   total porosity and the spatial porosity distribution and microstructure
   of the rocks were investigated using infiltration of
   carbon-14-methylmethacrylate, electron microscopy and Hg-porosimetry.
   The laboratory-scale diffusion experiments were performed using (1) the
   out-leaching technique of methylmethacrylate (MMA), (2) the
   through-diffusion of tritiated water (HTO) and chloride in the liquid
   phase and (3) the through-diffusion of helium in the gas phase.
   The results of structure investigations indicate that alteration and
   weathering create micrometric-scale pore apertures, visible as fissures
   and cracks. These migration pathways dominate in laboratory-scale
   diffusion experiments and result in high effective porosities and
   effective diffusivities. Alteration also creates spherical pores,
   smaller than 1 mu m, especially in heavily altered biotite and
   plagioclase minerals. The altered mineral phases act as quasi dead-end
   pores hindering the diffusion of non-sorbing tracers. The heterogeneity
   of the matrix is increased. The heterogeneous spatial pore structure of
   altered and weathered rock samples causes uncertainty in the diffusion
   coefficients owing to an assumed homogeneous matrix in Fickian diffusion
   models. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   was conceived to allow an analysis of the data using a constant

   The experimental results tend to show reversibility of sorption when the
   surface loading is small, and irreversibility when the surface loading
   is high. Surface complexation modeling gives a good interpretation of
   these two phenomena, taking into account hydroxylation of the surface
   complexes. In these two cases, it is possible to describe sorption and
   desorption curves with the same surface stoichiometries and the same
   surface complexation constants. The existence of these surface complexes
   depends on the pH of the solution, surface loading, and reaction

Abstract = {{This work identifies the main phenomena that control the peptisation and
   transport of clay particles in a sand core. Clay can be dispersed into
   small particles in an aqueous solution of low ionic strength. This
   property is used to generate clay particles with NaCl concentration
   varying from 0.5 M to 0.015 M. For this purpose, a chromatographic
   column is initially packed with a 5\% clay-sand mixture. The monitored
   decrease of the NaCl concentration of the feed solution allows the
   control of transport of the particles without plugging the porous
   medium. In this condition it is shown that in a column of a given
   length, the amount of clay particles released into solution and
   available to transport, depend only on NaCl concentration. Some clay
   particles are available to migration when the NaCl concentration of the
   feed concentration is between 0.16 M and 0.05 M (first domain) or
   between 0.035 M and 0.019 M (second domain). An empirical function,
   P-d({[}NaCl]), accounts for this particle generation. Transport is
   mainly dependent on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the porous
   medium that vary during the elution, probably owing to the particle
   motion inside the column. A phenomenological modelling is derived from
   these results, coupling the particle generation term, P-d({[}NaCl]),
   with an adapted nonequilibrium transport solute model. Similarly to the
   solute, particles were attributed a characteristic time of mass transfer
   between mobile and immobile water zones, This is sufficient to take into
   account the kinetic limitations of particles transport. The values of
   the parameters are determined by independent experiments. Finally,
   breakthrough curves of clay particles are predicted when a column of a
   given length is flushed by a salinity gradient of NaCl in various
   conditions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Tracer tests provide highly valuable information about the transport
   properties of saturated rocks which is essential to the characterization
   of a potential radioactive waste repository site. In the frame of El
   Berrocal project, a set of tracer tests was performed in a complex
   geometry of inclined boreholes, combined with highly fractured
   transmissive zones. The aims of the tracer test programme were to gain
   experience, knowledge and insight into field transport experiments. To
   achieve this a detailed programme of new instrumentation design, site
   characterization and laboratory tasks was developed. For field
   monitoring a new electronic system was developed. The system is able to
   measure up to 256 parameters per borehole, with surface equipment to
   control pumping rates and physical and chemical parameters at both
   injection and extraction boreholes. The experiments progressed from
   single borehole dilution tests under both natural flow and forced
   gradient conditions to convergent flow tracer tests. Dilution tests
   helped to discriminate the most suitable borehole sections at which to
   inject tracers. The tracers were selected by the results of the
   laboratory programme. Uranine (fluorescein), DTPA-gadolinium
   (diethylenetriaminopentacetic acid, gadolinium (III)), and deuterium
   were injected simultaneously in one borehole section and recovered at
   another borehole 20 m away, pumping at a flowrate of 0.1 1 min(-1).
   First results showed a thickness porosity of 1.2 X 10(-3) m and a
   longitudinal dispersivity of 17.0 m using uranine data acquired over a
   period of 4 d, at which point the recovery concentration had reached a
   maximum. However, gadolinium and deuterium appeared to travel faster,
   arriving at peak values after only 2 d of injection. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A modelling experimental activity was developed to characterise the
   hydraulic behaviour of water-bearing fractures in crystalline rocks.
   Three conservative tracers were injected into two packed-off sections of
   the same well, 69 m deep in a granite formation, and recovered by
   pumping from an isolated section of a second borehole, 46 m deep, 14 m
   apart. The concept of this design is to characterise separately an
   isolated fracture zone intersecting the lower parts of both wells from
   the fracture network intersecting the bulk of the rock.
   Before using the tracers in the field, their behaviour was studied in
   the laboratory under controlled conditions. Fluorescein, eosin and
   iodide were finally chosen as the best spikes.
   The field experiments were developed under strictly controlled
   conditions, such as (1) checking the hydraulic pressure in the
   packed-off sections and in other parts of circuits; (2) mixing the
   tracer solutions during the injection and checking their homogeneity;
   (3) performing a continuous and automatic monitoring of tracer
   concentration in the arrival well.
   Iodide and fluorescein were injected in one section, and eosin in the
   other section. The pumping rate was maintained at 21 min(-1). The test
   lasted 27 d after which from 40 to 60\% of the injected masses were
   recovered.
   Breakthrough curve analysis considered two conceptual models: radial
   advective-dispersive transport with and without matrix diffusion: the
   first model returns thickness-porosity values around 0.2 X 10(-1) m and
   dispersivity around 4 m. Parameters are remarkably consistent for iodide
   and fluorescein, although, fittings can be improved. The matrix
   diffusion model provides much better fittings by decreasing thickness
   porosity to 0.8 X 10(-2) m. Dispersivities range from 0.5 to 0.9 m and
   the molecular diffusion ten differentiates the behaviour of conservative
   tracers such as fluorescein and iodide. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of particle migration in fractured rock, required to
   assess the potential for colloid-facilitated transport of radionuclides,
   can best be evaluated when the results of laboratory experiments are
   demonstrated in the field. Field-scale migration experiments with silica
   colloids were carried out at AECL's Underground Research Laboratory
   (URL), located in southern Manitoba, to develop the methodology for
   large-scale migration experiments and to determine whether colloid
   transport is possible over distances up to 17 m. In addition, these
   experiments were designed to evaluate the effects of flow rate and flow
   path geometry, and to determine whether colloid tracers could be used to
   provide additional information on subsurface transport to that provided
   by conservative tracers alone. The colloid migration studies were
   carried out as part of AECL's Transport Properties in Highly Fractured
   Rock Experiment, the objective of which was to develop and demonstrate
   methods for evaluating the solute transport characteristics of zones of
   highly fractured rock. The experiments were carried out within fracture
   zone 2 as two-well recirculating, two-well non-recirculating, and
   convergent flow tests, using injection rates of 5 and 101 min(-1).
   silica colloids with a 20 nm size were used because they are potentially
   mobile due to their stability, small size and negative surface charge.
   The shapes of elution profiles for colloids and conservative tracers
   were similar, demonstrating that colloids can migrate over distances of
   17 m. The local region of drawdown towards the URL shaft affected
   colloid migration and, to a lesser extent, conservative tracer migration
   within the flow field established by the two-well tracer tests. These
   results indicate that stable colloids, with sizes as small as 20 nm,
   have different migration properties from dissolved conservative tracers.

Abstract = {{Two successive dipole tracer experiments were performed in a fractured
   rock at the Grimsel Test Site in February/March 1993. In both
   experiments NaCl was used as a tracer and the extraction rate was twice
   the injection rate. In the second experiment injection and extraction
   were interchanged ('reverse experiment'). The withdrawal rate remained
   twice the injection rate. Long tailing was characteristic for the
   breakthrough curves in both experiments, The tests were interpreted
   using a single fracture flow model. Tracer transport is described by
   advection/dispersion along the fracture allowing for diffusion into an
   immobile matrix. We were able to interpret the breakthrough curves for
   both experiments by one unique set of parameters, describing transport
   and baseflow. Uniqueness could only be achieved when using the
   information from both experiments. We conclude that performing a reverse
   experiment is an indispensable tool for parameter identification in
   dipole tracer tests.
   A sensitivity analysis proved that not only the exchange of tracer
   between the mobile zone and the immobile matrix but also transversal
   dispersivity is responsible for the tailing in the breakthrough curves.
   Further, the typical exchange time between mobile and immobile media was
   too small to be attributed to mere molecular diffusion into the matrix.
   The interpretation of the estimated parameters allows us to conclude
   that we did not observe matrix diffusion but a fast exchange of tracer
   between the mobile zone and both the adjacent rock and less pervious
   zones within the fracture. Analysis of the joint covariance matrices
   showed that the estimated transport parameters have small errors. (C)

Abstract = {{Organic matter has a great influence over the fate of inorganic colloids
   in surface waters, The chemical nature and structure of natural organic
   matter (NOM) will be an important factor in determining whether colloids
   will be stabilised or destabilised by NOM. Under environmentally
   relevant conditions, the ubiquitous fulvic acids are likely to be
   responsible for coating and imparting a negative charge to colloids, If
   the adsorbed polyelectrolyte coating produces an increase in absolute
   surface potential, it will act to stabilise colloids in the water
   column. On the other hand, colloidal organic carbon, especially
   chain-like structures, has been shown to be involved in the aggregation
   of inorganic colloids through the formation of bridges. It is highly
   probable that both adsorption and bridging flocculation are occurring
   simultaneously in the natural aquatic environment. The importance of
   each process depends directly on the nature and concentration of organic
   matter in the system and indirectly on the productivity of the lake, its
   hydrological pathways, temporal variations, temperature, etc. The
   present paper reports such results and emphasises the need to
   discriminate the different kinds of NOM. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Binding of radionuclides to natural colloids can significantly alter
   their transport behaviour in porous media. Dependent on the interaction
   between radionuclides, colloids and the solid matrix, radionuclide
   transport may be enhanced or retarded as a result of the presence of
   colloids. Often, equilibrium models are used to describe interactions
   between radionuclides, colloids and the solid matrix. However,
   experimental results indicate that kinetic processes may be important.
   In this paper, a model for coupled colloid and radionuclide transport in
   porous media is presented. Kinetic relationships are incorporated for
   the interaction between radionuclides, colloids and solid matrix. With
   this transport model, column experiments have been simulated, and
   modelling results are compared with experimental data reported in
   literature. It appears that kinetic interaction relationships are
   required to adequately model the experimental data. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The current approach for modelling ion adsorption onto binary
   (hydr)oxides using homogeneous surface complexation models involves the
   assumption of either an ideal mixture of the two surfaces (i.e. two
   surface sites on one surface) or a patchwise surface (i.e. two surfaces
   with one surface site on each surface). As the physical truth should be
   between these two limiting cases, a model which assumes a patchwise
   surface constituted of three patches is proposed. Two patches represent
   the distinct (hydr)oxides, and the third one a mixture of these distinct
   (hydr)oxides. Using the diffuse layer model, the three approaches are
   applied to literature data for Cd adsorption onto binary mixtures of
   alumina-coated silica at total constant Cd concentration and varying
   amounts of alumina coatings. For Cd adsorption onto these binary
   (hydr)oxide systems, the new approach explains the observed potential
   effects. The proposed model, which contains two additional adjustable
   parameters in terms of site concentrations or one adjustable parameter
   in terms of specific surface area, is more successful than the two
   limiting cases. The new model is then validated by predicting Ca and Zn
   behaviour on the same binary (hydr)oxide system. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In earlier work using coupled geochemical and transport models such as
   CHEQMATE, HYDROGEOCHEM, PHREEQM and other codes, we have found that,
   when the mass of mineral phases in the system is large compared with the
   solubilities of the minerals in the water, computing times become
   prohibitively large. These problems have been found for several systems
   of interest for radionuclide migration. In a study of the coupled
   formation and movement of redox fronts, hydrolysis fronts and dissolving
   and precipitating secondary minerals, scaling of the amounts of the
   minerals could be made without influencing the results. This is not
   possible in general.
   In these circumstances the computations would typically need millions or
   many millions of time steps to have the fronts move through one `'cell''
   in a finite difference based code. It has been noted, however, that this
   also leads to stationary states, developing in the system. This has been
   pointed out and utilised by Lichtner. We have developed a code,
   CHEMFRONTS, which utilises this property. The drawback is that it is not
   easy to incorporate diffusion/dispersion using this approach. It can
   only handle advection dominated transport. For such cases however it is
   extremely fast compared with conventional codes.
   We have now developed a technique whereby the stationary state
   approximation can be superimposed on and incorporated in finite
   difference and finite element codes. This speeds up the computations
   considerably. So far we have used it successfully in CHEQMATE,
   HYDROGEOCHEM and PHREEQM.
   In this paper we show the method and give some examples of its
   application using previously addressed problems. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work presents an intercomparison exercise between two geochemical
   migration codes, TRIO-EF (an object-oriented finite element code) and
   IMPACT (a chemical engineering code using mixing cells in series). The
   predictions of the two codes are compared with the reference
   experimental results obtained in a previous study of strontium transport
   in soil columns. This simulated geochemical system is well documented
   and includes ion exchange and dissolution-precipitation reactions. The
   solution transport is simulated by a one-dimensional
   advection-dispersion model. The predictions of TRIO-EF and IMPACT are
   both in good agreement with the experimental results. However, slight
   differences can be observed between the two codes, especially when
   concentration discontinuities are involved, such as precipitation fronts
   or changes in boundary conditions. These discrepancies between the two
   codes can mainly be attributed to the different discretisation
   approaches. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

   technology to remove Cs-137 and Sr-90 from the soil. 100 V DC current is

   time. If the soil to be treated has similar sorption and diffusion
   properties as bentonite, and when the soil is flushed with saline water

Abstract = {{Accidental releases of waste water from the first Czechoslovak nuclear
   power plant, Al, caused contamination of sediments of the Dudvah river,
   flowing into the Vah river, in Slovakia. Rather high concentrations of
   Cs-137 and Sr-90 (2150 Bq dm(-3) and 215 Bq dm(-3), respectively) were
   found in bottom sediments of a former channel of the re-engineered river
   body at a distance of about 250 m from a village, Siladice, with
   water-supply wells. In order to assess the possibility of contamination
   of the wells, underground migration of both radionuclides from the
   contaminated area was simulated using an original layered
   convection-diffusion model. K-d values determined in laboratory
   experiments were used. The analysis of the hydrological situation in the
   area reveals that the critical condition is a dominant horizontal
   groundwater flow near the water table in the direction from the Vah bank
   to Siladice, in the periods when the contaminated body lies under the
   water table. The simulation calculated under conservative conditions
   showed that the contamination of water-supply wells would not exceed
   permissible concentration limits. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A modelling study of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in the
   geosphere surrounding a repository for vitrified high-level waste sited
   in the crystalline basement of northern Switzerland has been carried out
   as part of the recently completed Kristallin-I project. The study
   derives information from an analysis of seven deep boreholes, along with
   seismic surveys, regional surface geological mapping and hydrochemical
   and hydrogeological analysis.
   This paper describes the transport model itself and how, by means of a
   suite of supporting models, field data are translated into input
   parameters. Supporting models include: (i), a conceptual model of the
   proposed siting region; (ii) a set of hydrogeological models, the
   formulation of which is guided by the conceptual model and by
   hydrochemical and isotopic data. Sources of uncertainty in the
   conceptual model are described and a parameter sensitivity study is
   presented that illustrates the resultant uncertainty in radiological
   consequences. A particular source of uncertainty is the heterogeneous
   nature of the geosphere, giving rise to a complex and incomplete dataset
   from which ranges of input parameter values must be derived. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{The feasibility of using a chemical reaction-based approach for
   evaluating and modelling the role of adsorption reactions in determining
   the geochemical confinement capacity of natural geological barriers is
   being studied as part of an on-going R\&D programme. The confined
   superficial aquifer underlying the Centre de Stockage de l'Aube
   facility, a geological barrier for this site, has been used as a case
   study with the following aims. First, development of a site
   characterisation protocol and demonstration of its use to determine the
   principal geochemical characteristics of aquifer materials using batch
   experiments and to represent the information obtained in terms of a
   chemical model. The experimental results obtained for Ni2+ partitioning
   as a function of total Ni, pH, total Ca and total solid can be
   satisfactorily represented in terms of reactions with an ion exchange
   site and a single amphoteric surface hydroxyl site with ferrihydrite
   reaction constants. A second objective is the incorporation of the
   reactions in a coupled geochemistry/transport code, and to verify the
   applicability of the coupled code predictions for Ni2+ mass transfer by
   comparison with the results obtained during column tracer experiments.
   The breakthrough curve and equilibrium solid phase Ni loading, predicted
   by a one-dimensional coupled model for a column tracer experiment, agree
   closely with observed data.
   Additional studies are underway to reduce model conditionality, to
   extend the adsorption model to other analogue cations and anions, to
   incorporate the effect of natural organic matter and to take into
   consideration precipitation/dissolution of amorphous Fe surface phases.

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the potential of
   groundwater microorganisms to degrade selected heterocyclic aromatic
   compounds containing nitrogen, sulphur, or oxygen (NSO-compounds) under
   four redox-conditions over a period of 846 days. Eight compounds
   (pyrrole, 1-methylpyrrole, quinoline, indole, carbazole,
   dibenzothiophene, benzofuran, and dibenzofuran) were degraded under
   aerobic conditions, whereas thiophene and benzothiophene were degraded
   only when other compounds were degraded concomitantly. Quinoline and
   indole were the only two NSO-compounds degraded under anaerobic
   conditions, even though the microorganisms present in the anaerobic
   microcosms were active throughout the incubation period. A high
   variability in the lag period among the NSO-compounds was observed under
   aerobic conditions. While quinoline, indole, and carbazole were degraded
   with a lag period of 3-25 days, the lag periods for pyrrole,
   dibenzothiophene, benzofuran, and dibenzofuran were significantly longer
   (29-278 days). Under anaerobic conditions, lag periods of 100-300 days
   were observed. Differences in the degradation rate among the compounds
   were also observed. Indole, quinoline, carbazole, and benzofuran were
   quickly degraded in the aerobic microcosms, whereas a slow degradation
   of dibenzothiophene and dibenzofuran was observed. Pyrrole and
   1-methylpyrrole were slowly degraded and 1-methylpyrrole was not
   completely removed within the 846 days. The anaerobic degradation rate
   was significantly slower than the aerobic degradation rate. The
   degradation rate under sulphate-reducing conditions was higher than
   under denitrifying and methanogenic conditions, though after re-addition
   of a compound a quick removal was observed.
   The persistence of many NSO-compounds under anaerobic conditions
   together with the long lag periods and the low degradation rates under
   aerobic conditions suggest that NSO-compounds might persist in
   groundwater at creosote-contaminated sites. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Three natural nonaggregated soil samples, with similar grain-size
   distributions, have been used to determine the dispersive behavior of
   porous media under steady, saturated and unsaturated flow conditions.
   Tritium was used as a tracer and was found to have no sorption on the
   solid matrix. Generated breakthrough curves (BTCs) for the unsaturated
   experiments were symmetrical with no evidence of tailing. The
   unsaturated experiments for two of the soils were adequately described
   by considering all the water in the pore volume as mobile. However,
   about 10\% of the pore water, independent of the degree of saturation,
   was found to be immobile in the case of the third soil during
   unsaturated flow, For this soil, there was no mass transfer between the
   two water regions, indicating that the immobile water is essentially
   isolated from the flowing water fraction. For all three soils,
   dispersivity under unsaturated conditions was found to be higher,
   independent of the degree of water saturation, than the value determined
   for the saturated experiments. This is inconsistent with what would be
   expected from the simple bundle-of-capillary-tubes model and does not
   agree well with a more sophisticated conceptualization of the porous
   medium. The data, however, clearly indicate a wider range in pore-water
   velocities when these soils are desaturated. (C) Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Column flow experiments under saturated conditions were conducted to
   investigate the sorption behavior of simazine on a Tujunga sandy loam.
   The Bow interruption technique was used to test whether rate-limited
   processes were present. The outflow results showed that the simazine
   sorption was not at equilibrium during the time of the experiment. This
   non-equilibrium was due to the sorption process, as the bromide tracer
   concentration did not change during flow interruption. Simazine
   breakthrough data could be best described by a two-stage, two-rate
   process, where the first rate is considerably faster than the second.
   The model predicts slow reaction kinetics, so that equilibrium was not
   reached even after 185h of flow interruption. Outflow data of the first
   simazine breakthrough only could be described well with a one-stage,
   rate-limited sorption model; flow interruption was necessary to reveal
   the second sorption stage. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A classical way to obtain three-fluid retention curves in porous media
   from measured two-fluid retention curves is based on the Leverett
   concept, which states that the total volumetric liquid content in a
   water-wet porous medium, containing water, a nonaqueous-phase liquid
   (NAPL) and air, is a function of the capillary pressure across the
   interface between the continuous NAPL and air. This functional
   relationship results from the assumed condition that in a three-fluid
   porous medium, the intermediate wetting fluid spreads over the water-air
   interface. Application of Leverett's concept may not be valid, however,
   for nonspreading NAPLs Like perchloroethylene (PCE). This paper
   discusses measurements of both PCE-air and water-PCE-air retention
   curves using a long vertical column in conjunction with a dual-energy
   gamma radiation system. The data indicate that the Leverett concept was
   applicable only until a critical PCE saturation had been reached. (C)

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional, multiphase flow experiment was conducted in the
   laboratory and numerically modelled using a finite difference multiphase
   flow code. Heptane, a lighter-than-water non-aqueous phase liquid

   spilt was completed, the LNAPL was allowed to distribute itself above
   the capillary fringe. The water pressure at the base of the experimental
   box was subsequently raised and lowered on two separate occasions to
   simulate fluctuating water table conditions. The water and LNAPL
   pressures were measured using hydrophillic and hydrophobic porous cups
   connected to pressure transducers and a data acquisition system. The
   laboratory spill was modelled using a hysteretic and non-hysteretic

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of one variable,
   natural organic matter, on residual gasoline saturation in sandy soils.
   Capillary pressure-saturation (P-c-S) relationships (air-gasoline) were
   determined for three physically-similar sandy soils, with different
   organic carbon contents (0.086\%, 0.89\% and 1.65\%) and residual
   gasoline saturations were compared. Two initial moisture conditions,
   residual water saturation and air-dry, were evaluated. One soil type was
   packed to two different bulk densities. Visualization of the soils using
   cryo-scanning electron microscopy was performed to aid in better
   understanding the role of the organic matter in the soil. The results
   showed that soils with higher organic contents had higher residual
   gasoline saturations when starting with an initially air-dry soil.
   Increasing the bulk density of the same air-dried soil resulted in an
   increase in residual gasoline saturation. In the presence of a residual
   water saturation, however, residual gasoline saturations were virtually
   identical for the three soils and independent of bulk density;
   approximately 5-10 times lower than in soil that was initially air-dry.
   The presence of the residual water effectively coated the surface of the
   soil thereby reducing or eliminating gasoline/soil interactions. Some
   residual water may also be occupying very small pore spaces, making
   these locations inaccessible to the gasoline. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The most important mechanisms that control the release of contaminants
   from a repository for nuclear or chemical waste have been studied. For
   the time scale of interest for the disposal of nuclear and even chemical
   waste, diffusion into the rock matrix is an important factor which
   retards and dilutes the contaminants. It is found that the water
   flow-rate distribution and the now-wetted surface are the entities that
   primarily determine the solute transport. If the diffusion into the rock
   matrix is negligible, the solute transport is determined by the water
   flow rate and the flow porosity. This is shown using analytical
   solutions obtained for simple geometries, such as the flow in a fracture
   with constant aperture or a channel. Similar results are obtained for
   more complex systems, such as flow in a fracture with variable aperture
   and through a network of channels. It is also found that the use of a
   retardation factor relating the travel times of interacting and
   noninteracting solutes is inappropriate and may be misleading. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Stable colloidal particles can travel long distances in subsurface
   environments and carry particle-reactive contaminants with them to
   locations further than predicted by the conventional
   advective-dispersive transport equation. When such carriers exist in a
   saturated porous medium, the system can be idealized as consisting of
   three phases: an aqueous phase, a carrier phase, and a stationary solid
   matrix phase. However, when colloids are present in an unsaturated
   porous medium, the system representation should include one more phase,
   i.e. the air phase. In the work reported, a mathematical model was
   developed to describe the transport and fate of the colloidal particles
   and a non-volatile contaminant in unsaturated porous media. The model is
   based on mass balance equations in a four-phase porous medium. Colloid
   mass transfer mechanisms among aqueous, solid matrix, and air phases,
   and contaminant mass transfer between aqueous and colloid phases are
   represented by kinetic expressions. Governing equations are
   non-dimensionalized and solved to investigate colloid and contaminant
   transport in an unsaturated porous medium. A sensitivity analysis of the
   transport model was utilized to assess the effects of several parameters
   on model behavior. The colloid transport model matches successfully with
   experimental data of Wan and Wilson. The presence of air-water interface
   retards the colloid transport significantly counterbalancing the
   facilitating effect of colloids. However, the retardation of contaminant
   transport by colloids is highly dependent on the properties of the
   contaminant and the colloidal surface. (C) 1997 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The transport and elution behavior of Cd and Ni in the presence of Ca in
   subsurface soils was investigated using batch and miscible-displacement
   experiments. The adsorption of Cd and Ni by the soils was dramatically
   decreased and their transport through the soils was significantly
   enhanced in the presence of Ca. These effects were attributed to the
   competition between Ca and these metals for exchange sites on the soil
   surfaces. The volume of CaCl2 solution required to remove a certain \%
   of Cd decreased with increasing concentration of CaCl2. However, the
   concentration of CaCl2 used to flush the soil did not significantly
   affect the final \% of Cd removed, which was 90\%. The position of the
   Cd elution peak varied with Ca concentration due to the nonlinear
   sorption behavior of Ca. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new reversible-flow design for a continuously
   stirred reactor used to study sorption mass transfer in soil and solvent
   systems. The stirred reactor has potential advantages over conventional
   packed column or batch reactors because it isolates intraparticle
   sorption rate limitations from advective-dispersive transport, yet
   allows changes to flux through the reactor for analysis of sorption
   kinetics under dynamic conditions. Previously, stirred reactors have
   often failed due to clogging of sediment on the effluent frit. The
   reverse-flow backwashing design allows longer life and higher confidence
   in maintaining mixed conditions than previous designs. Mass transfer
   rate coefficients estimated from stirred and column experiments are
   compared; both techniques produced results consistent with a published
   correlation. The data also show that fitted sorption mass transfer
   coefficients can be strongly dependent on the choice of equilibrium
   partition coefficient (i.e. batch or first-moment derived values), and
   that the conventional two-site sorption kinetics model fails to
   accurately predict sorption mass transfer in the presence of changing
   solvent velocity through the reactor. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We perform a series of three-phase gravity drainage experiments in
   columns containing two different sands and for three different light
   non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) - hexane, iso-octane and n-decane.
   The fluid system is chosen to have different values of the equilibrium
   spreading coefficient, which measures the tendency for LNAPL to spread
   on water. The final configuration of air, water and LNAPL in
   capillary/gravity equilibrium is measured using gas chromatography. We
   find that the saturation of LNAPL in the top part of the column for the
   hexane system could be as low as 0.1\%, but that it increases with
   increasing soil heterogeneity and with decreasing spreading coefficient.
   We also measure the air/water distributions in capillary/gravity
   equilibrium to obtain the capillary pressure curve for each sand. Using
   a modified Leverett J function scaling, we predict the distribution of
   continuous LNAPL, water and air from a single capillary pressure curve
   and compare with our experimental results. The predictions match the
   measurements in the regions where the NAPL saturation is greater than
   similar to 10\%. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A microscale mathematical model is developed to analyze the desorption
   rate limited extraction of volatile organic compounds in a soil column.
   By solving the diffusion equation in the liquid layer around the soil
   particles and incorporating the effects of slow desorption from the soil
   surfaces, it is found that the concentration of organics in the effluent
   is eventually given by the sum of two separate contributions. The first
   represents the removal of the compounds initially dissolved in the
   liquid layer by diffusion, providing an exponentially decaying
   concentration in the effluent. The second represents the removal of the
   organics, initially adsorbed onto the solid surfaces, by slow desorption
   producing the long-time tail which has been observed in the effluent
   concentration during soil vapor extraction. This model was applied to
   two bench-scale columns packed with soil contaminated by volatile
   organic compound (VOC) contaminated soil. The simplified results of the
   mathematical model allow such parameters as the effective diffusion
   length, area of gas-liquid contact, the desorption rate constant and the
   equilibrium partition coefficient, for trichloroethylene in the two soil
   columns to be determined. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface fate and transport models are utilized to predict
   concentrations of chemicals leaching from wastes into downgradient
   receptor wells. The contaminant concentrations in groundwater provide a
   measure of the risk to human health and the environment. The level of
   potential risk is currently used by the U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency to determine whether management of the wastes should conform to
   hazardous waste management standards. It is important that the transport
   and fate of contaminants is simulated realistically. Most models in
   common use are inappropriate for simulating the migration of wastes
   containing significant fractions of nonaqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs).
   The migration of NAPL and its dissolved constituents may not be reliably
   predicted using conventional aqueous-phase transport simulations. To
   overcome this deficiency, an efficient and robust regulatory assessment
   model incorporating multiphase flow and transport in the unsaturated and
   saturated zones of the subsurface environment has been developed. The
   proposed composite model takes into account all of the major transport
   processes including infiltration and ambient flow of NAPL, entrapment of
   residual NAPL, adsorption, volatilization, degradation, dissolution of
   chemical constituents, and transport by advection and hydrodynamic
   dispersion. Conceptually, the subsurface is treated as a composite
   unsaturated zone-saturated zone system. The composite simulator consists
   of three major interconnected computational modules representing the
   following components of the migration pathway: (1) vertical multiphase
   flow and transport in the unsaturated zone; (2) areal movement of the
   free-product lens in the saturated zone with vertical equilibrium; and
   (3) three-dimensional aqueous-phase transport of dissolved chemicals in
   ambient groundwater. Such a composite model configuration promotes
   computational efficiency and robustness (desirable for regulatory
   assessment applications). Two examples are presented to demonstrate the
   model verification and a site application. Simulation results obtained
   using the composite modeling approach are compared with a rigorous
   numerical solution and field observations of crude oil saturations and
   plume concentrations of total dissolved organic carbon at a spill site
   in Minnesota, U.S.A. These comparisons demonstrate the ability of the
   present model to provide realistic depiction of field-scale situations.

Title = {{Predicting solute transport in heterogeneous media from results obtained
   in homogeneous ones: An experimental approach}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to show that the hydrodispersive transport
   parameters of a solute in a heterogeneous medium can be predicted using
   parameters determined by several experiments with the different
   homogeneous media that constitute together the heterogeneous one.
   Elementary rules for predicting these parameters are defined. Three
   types of experiments were carried out.
   (1) Homogeneous medium transport experiments in 1-D columns. They were
   fitted with the help of a new numerical particle tracking method,
   including advection-dispersion and exchange between mobile and immobile
   water with first-order kinetics.
   (2) Layered heterogeneous media. The experiments were simulated by the
   numerical model without fitting, using the parameters of each of the
   layers of the homogeneous media included in the heterogeneous one. The
   results prove that, in such layered media, the global transport problem
   can be considered as the convolution of elementary transports in
   homogeneous blocks. We will therefore conclude that the reservoir
   simulation methods which represent the heterogeneous reservoir as a
   random set of elementary homogeneous blocks can be used to represent
   transport if each elementary block is given its appropriate
   hydrodispersive parameters.
   (3) Homogeneous mixtures of two pure components. The experiments
   produced three interesting results. The immobile water volume is the
   direct linear combination of its equivalent in the two components,
   weighted by the volumetric fraction of the component in the mixture. The
   dispersivity of the medium also evolves linearly, but is affected by an
   initial sharp rise due to a strong increase in local flow path
   heterogeneities whenever a `'foreign body'' is introduced into a pure
   component. The exchange rate between mobile and immobile water is also
   perturbed by mixing. In a binary mixture of one component with dual
   porosity and another one without, the exchange rate decreases with the
   increase of the volumetric fraction of the medium without dual porosity.
   It seems that, even if it does not modify the volumes of immobile and
   mobile water, it reduces the surface/volume ratio of the solid medium
   and consequently the exchange rate. Mixing rules could be adopted in
   order to modify the values of the hydrodispersive parameters that need
   to be introduced for the elementary blocks of heterogeneous reservoirs.

Abstract = {{`'Traditional'' approaches to sampling groundwater and interpreting
   monitoring well data often provide misleading pictures of plume shape
   and location in the subsurface and the true extent of contamination.
   Groundwater samples acquired using pumps and bailers in conventional
   monitoring wells yield data which are largely dependent upon the length
   of the screened interval, the purging and sampling method employed, and
   the purge volume extracted prior to sample collection. Accurate
   delineation of plume boundaries and vertical concentration gradients is
   desirable, to accurately characterize waste sites and optimize remedial
   strategies. The objective of this study was to compare sampling results
   using four different sampling approaches and devices. Conventional
   monitoring wells were sampled with an electric submersible pump using
   low-flow sampling techniques and with a bailer using `'traditional''
   sampling methods. The same wells were also sampled with a passive
   multi-layer sampling system (DMLS(R), Margan Ltd.). Finally, aqueous
   concentrations were also determined in the formation adjacent to the
   monitoring wells studied using a Geoprobe(R) and short (30 cm) screens.
   Results indicated that `'traditional'' sampling methods can provide
   misleading information regarding contaminant distribution and mass and
   indeed can miss the presence of contamination altogether. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Changes in the volatile organic liquid mixture (VOLM) hydraulic
   conductivity in different soils are compared with corresponding changes
   in VOLM viscosity through an extended analysis of results from three
   previous experimental studies. The conductivity with regard to four
   different kerosene mixtures, corresponding to different degrees of
   volatilisation of the original kerosene, was determined in one set of
   soils; an increasing degree of volatilisation implies less lighter
   kerosene compounds, changing both kerosene viscosity and its chemical
   composition. In another set of soils, kerosene conductivity measurements
   were conducted at two temperatures, which provided two different
   viscosities but did not affect the kerosene chemical composition. Both
   volatilisation- and temperature-induced changes in kerosene viscosity
   and conductivity were studied in two of the soils. In all the soils that
   were used in the temperature experiments, the changes in kerosene
   conductivity could be successfully predicted by scaling the original
   kerosene conductivity value based on the observed viscosity ratio. For
   the chemically different kerosene mixtures, the changes in conductivity
   agreed with the corresponding viscosity changes only in inert sands. For
   a montmorillonitic loam, a montmorillonitic clay and a peat soil,
   considerable deviations were found between the conductivity ratio and
   the viscosity ratio; for the peat, which was also used in temperature
   experiments, no such deviations were observed at different temperatures.
   The deviations between the conductivity ratio and the viscosity ratio
   were also found to increase with increasing differences in kerosene
   chemical composition. These results indicate that chemical composition
   may be of major importance for VOLM hydraulic conductivity in
   interacting soils, apart from the effect that the composition has on
   viscosity. The viscosity ratios were shown to deviate more than 300\%
   from observed conductivity ratios for the chemically most different
   kerosene mixtures. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Bank-filtrated water is an important component of the drinking water
   production in many countries. The changes in the water chemistry during
   the transfer from the river to the aquifer have important implications
   for the quality of the produced water. In this paper, we first describe
   certain features of the evolution of the water chemistry during
   bank-filtration in the case of an experimental site, part of a large
   well field (Seine river, France). Here, bank-filtration leads to highly
   reducing conditions in the aquifer. A conceptual and numerical
   macroscopic model of this evolution, focusing on nitrogen compounds, is
   then presented. The model is designed to simulate organic matter
   mineralization and redox reactions catalyzed by bacteria in the river
   bed sediments where water infiltrates. Growth and decay of bacteria are
   explicitly accounted for and a numerical solution is found with an
   operator splitting technique. The model is able to reproduce column
   experiments by von Gunten and Zobrist (1993) designed to simulate
   infiltration of organically polluted river water into an aquifer. A
   model application to the characteristics of the experimental site is
   also presented. Results of a sensitivity analysis highlight the
   importance of: (1) the flow rate of water infiltrating river bed
   sediments; and (2) the organic carbon content of these sediments, for
   the evolution of the water quality during transfer from the river to the
   aquifer. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{An anionic monorhamnolipid biosurfactant produced by Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa was investigated for its potential to remove residual
   hexadecane from sand columns. In a series of column experiments,
   residual hexadecane saturation was established by pumping
   C-14-hexadecane into water-saturated sand columns and then flushing with
   water at a velocity of 25 cm h(-1). Monorhamnolipid solutions of varying
   concentration were then applied to the columns at a velocity of 15 cm
   h(-1) to remove the residual hexadecane. Of the rhamnolipid
   concentrations tested, which ranged from 40 to 1500 mg l(-1), the
   optimal concentration for residual removal was 500 mg l(-1),
   approximately ten times the critical micelle concentration (cmc).
   Approximately 84\% of the residual was removed from the column packed
   with 20/30 mesh sand, and 22\% was removed from the 40/50 mesh column.
   The primary mechanism for residual removal was mobilization
   (displacement and dispersion), whereas solubilization was found to be
   insignificant. The performance of monorhamnolipid was compared with that
   of two synthetic surfactant solutions on a mass basis (500 mg l(-1)) for
   the 40/50 mesh sand. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.2 X cmc), and
   polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate (38 X cmc), removed 0\% and
   6.1\% of the residual saturation, respectively. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Contaminant transport in structured soil systems is often characterised
   by early and asymmetric breakthrough curves. These phenomena are usually
   interpreted using the mobile/immobile region model, which is suitable
   for the simulation of nonequilibrium processes. The parameters involved
   in two-region models, viz. the rate parameter, alpha, and the fraction
   of mobile zone, beta, are often obtained by fitting procedures since
   there is no independent method available to estimate them. For porous
   media with a well-defined structure, e.g., one containing aggregates,
   beta is often related to the volume fraction of the aggregates. However,
   both alpha and beta are less understood when the two-region model is
   applied to media that are non-structured, but may have randomly
   distributed hydraulic conductivities. Laboratory experiments with
   randomly packed artificial media and numerical experiments using
   randomly distributed hydraulic conductivities were conducted to study
   the behaviour of these parameters. The variation of these parameters
   with pore-water velocity and porous medium characteristics is explored
   in detail. The results indicate that the rate parameter, alpha, usually
   increases linearly with pore-water velocity. The parameter, beta, is a
   characteristic of the medium that varies with the standard deviation of
   the log of hydraulic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{The transport and fate of many contaminants in subsurface systems can be
   influenced by several rate-limited processes, such as rate-limited
   sorption, diffusional mass transfer, and transformation reactions.
   Identification of the controlling process in such systems is often
   difficult, and is confounded by the possible influence of additional
   factors such as nonlinear or hysteretic sorption. We present a
   relatively simple method, flow interruption, that can be used to
   discriminate between various sets of processes. The application of the
   method is illustrated with results obtained from experiments performed
   for selected systems. Specific process-pairs investigated include
   physical nonequilibrium vs. physical heterogeneity, rate-limited
   sorption vs. nonlinear sorption, and sorption vs. transformation
   reactions. The results show that, while both physical nonequilibrium and
   physical heterogeneity can cause enhanced spreading or dispersion, only
   the former causes a noticeable concentration perturbation upon
   imposition of flow interruption under typical conditions. In addition,
   while both rate-limited sorption and nonlinear sorption can cause
   breakthrough curves to exhibit tailing, only rate-limited sorption
   induces a concentration perturbation upon imposition of flow
   interruption. The information obtained from applying flow interruption
   can be used to assist in the planning of additional, process-specific
   experiments and to help identify appropriate mathematical models to be
   used for transport simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Spheres and pendular rings of trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene
   are observed dissolving in an artificial porous medium consisting of a
   single layer of glass beads. Given the simple geometry of the droplets,
   pore-scale mass transfer coefficients are calculated. For dissolving
   spheres, mass transfer coefficients are found to be constant over time.
   However, coefficients for pendular rings are found to decrease as the
   rings shrink in size. This is consistent with the concept of
   diffusion-controlled mass transfer in low-flow zones. Sherwood numbers
   measured at Reynolds numbers between 0.0033 and 8.33 show a similar
   trend to empirical relationships established by previous researchers
   using other techniques. As in previous experiments, considerable scatter
   in mass transfer rates is observed at a given mean flux. It is
   hypothesized that this variation in local mass transfer rates is caused
   by variations in local pore velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Column experiments were performed under water-saturated conditions to
   evaluate the effectiveness of low-concentration surfactant solution at
   removing a trapped light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) o-xylene and a
   dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) o-dichlorobenzene from soil.
   Sorption of the ethoxylated alcohol (Witconol SN90) surfactant on the
   porous material was evaluated using both batch and column flow
   experiments. The batch sorption results showed that the sorption of the
   surfactant on sand reached a minimum value near the surfactant
   concentration selected for the experiments. Negligible sorption of the
   surfactant was observed in the column sorption experiment at the 90 cm
   day(-1) flow rate used in our study, implying that the residence time
   was too short for equilibrium sorption to be reached. The NAPLs were
   removed from the columns by solubilization, emulsification and
   mobilization. Macroemulsions were formed in both batch and column
   experiments, suggesting that the NAPL was mostly removed by immiscible
   displacement. The direction of flow was an important parameter in LNAPL
   removal, influencing both the location of the chemical in the column and
   the removal efficiency. The percentage of DNAPL removed from the column
   was successfully described using a dissolving sphere model with
   increased apparent solubility. However, the model failed to describe the
   NAPL distribution in the column adequately, suggesting that a more
   complex process than the solubility enhancement accounted for by the
   model is occurring.}},

Abstract = {{Soil column experiments were conducted to study bacterial growth and
   transport in porous media under denitrifying conditions. The study used
   a denitrifying microbial consortium isolated from aquifer sediments
   sampled at the U.S. Department of Energy's Hanford site.
   One-dimensional, packed-column transport studies were conducted under
   two substrate loading conditions. A detailed numerical model was
   developed to predict the measured effluent cell and substrate
   concentration profiles. First-order attachment and detachment models
   described the interphase exchange processes between suspended and
   attached biomass. Insignificantly different detachment coefficient
   values of 0.32 and 0.43 day(-1), respectively, were estimated for the
   high and low nitrate loading conditions (48 and 5 mg l(-1) NO3,
   respectively). Comparison of these values with those calculated from
   published data for aerobically growing organisms shows that the
   denitrifying consortium had lower detachment rate coefficients. This
   suggests that, similar to detachment rates in reactor-grown biofilms,
   detachment in porous media may increase with microbial growth rate.
   However, available literature data are not sufficient to confirm a
   specific analytical model for predicting this growth dependence.}},

Abstract = {{A tracer-elution experiment was conducted in a 9-m-thick alluvial sand
   aquifer at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, Denver, Colorado, within an
   extensive 1,1,1-trichloroethane and trichloroethene plume. The
   forced-gradient flow field was controlled by an injection well and an
   extraction well separated by 8.4 m and aligned in the direction of the
   natural-gradient flow. Upon extraction, the contaminant-laden water was
   treated by air stripping and reinjected into the injection well. Iodide
   tracer was added to the injection flow during the initial 27.5 h of the
   experiment. Tracer transport and organic contaminant elution were
   monitored by four 0.15-m-screened drive points and a fully penetrating
   monitoring well. Relative permeabilities, dispersivities and retardation
   factors were estimated from tracer breakthrough and contaminant elution
   curves by the moment method and by curve-fitting with an
   advection-dispersion model. Tracer transport through the four strata
   sampled by the drive points indicated a permeability variation of three
   orders of magnitude. Contaminant elution was not observed in the
   lowest-permeability stratum monitored during the experiment. In all
   monitored strata, contaminant elution was controlled primarily by
   permeability effects on water flow and exhibited minimal retardation or
   desorption effects. The fully penetrating monitoring well exhibited a
   tracer response primarily from the more permeable strata with the
   addition of tracer from the less permeable strata producing an increased
   breakthrough spreading. This increased spreading or dispersion was
   reflected in a higher longitudinal dispersivity estimate (1.2 m assuming
   a homogeneous aquifer) than dispersivity estimates from the drive-point
   sampler tracer curves (ranging from 5 to 21 cm). Contaminant elution
   curves from the fully penetrating monitoring well exhibited an initial
   response primarily from the more permeable strata (rapid elution of
   contaminants) and provided no insight into the elution response of the
   majority of the aquifer strata. Low mass recoveries of tracer within
   low-permeability layers are suspected to be due to the initial transient
   flow field and/or the initially high range of hydraulic conductivities
   along the injection well screen.}},

Abstract = {{The metal ion binding characteristics of particulate matter obtained
   from column experiments on the anaerobic digestion of solid waste were
   studied using a titrimetric approach. The experimental set-up allowed us
   to study the dynamics of particle bound ligand concentrations during
   digestion processes typically found in landfills.
   We developed a continuous titration method by simultaneously using a
   Cd-sensitive and pH electrode and combining metal and acid/base
   titrations. This technique allows for a more precise determination of
   pK(a)-log K-M pairs for each ligand than metal titrations alone. The
   results were compared with titration methods using differential pulse
   anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV) and atomic absorption spectroscopy
   (AAS) with longer equilibration times in order to further characterize
   ligand properties such as reaction kinetics, the electrochemical
   lability of the respective complex during DPASV, the distinction between
   metal adsorption to particulate matter and metal complexation by soluble
   ligands adhered to particles, reversibility of the binding process by
   competition studies, and resistance against purging with nitrogen gas.
   The properties of seven major metal binding ligands were identified and
   assignments to the most likely functional groups were made. The most
   important ligand properties are for ligand A: pK(a) approximate to 9.2,
   log K-Cd approximate to 7.0 fast reaction kinetics (mercapto groups);
   ligand B: pK(a) approximate to 4.8, log K-Cd approximate to 6.0, slow
   reaction kinetics (chelates with 3 or 4 carboxylic groups); Ligand C:
   pK(a) approximate to 6.0, log K-Cd approximate to 13.0, irreversible
   metal binding at basic pH-values (uptake inside bacterial cells); ligand
   D: pK(a) approximate to 7.7, log K-Cd approximate to 4.0, runs parallel
   to N content of particulate matter with digestion time (primary amines
   neighboring oxo groups); ligand E: pK(a) approximate to 12.0, log K-Cd
   approximate to 9.0, runs parallel to P content of particulate matter
   (phosphate); ligand F: pK(a) >> 9.0, log K-Cd approximate to pK(a) +
   0.4, runs parallel to N content of particulate matter (primary amines
   neighboring SH groups); and ligand di pK(a) less than or equal to 4.8,
   log K-Pb approximate to 4.3, strong Pb2+ ligand, even at low pH-values.
   Metal ions were found to be irreversibly bound by ligand C at low
   heavy-metal concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations the binding
   is reversible and can be predicted using the mass action law. The
   concentrations of ligands containing amino groups (D, F) increase
   towards the end of the digestion process (methanogenic phase). All other
   ligands have their concentration maximum in the transition phase between
   acetogenic and methanogenic phase.}},

Abstract = {{First-order analysis, based on a stochastic continuum presentation of
   the Eulerian retarded velocity in heterogeneous, partially saturated
   porous formations and a general Lagrangian description of the transport,
   was used to investigate the effect of both the anisotropy of the
   formation and the texture of the soil materials constituting the
   formation, on the spreading of reactive (sorptive) solutes under
   unsaturated flow. The physically plausible situation in which the
   retardation factor is negatively correlated with log-unsaturated
   conductivity was considered in this study. Results of the analyses show
   that for a given water saturation and gravity-dominated unsaturated
   flow, both the physical and chemical heterogeneities of the formation
   enhance the spreading of the reactive solute in the longitudinal
   direction. This applies especially in formations with typical flow
   barriers which are small in a direction perpendicular to the mean flow,
   relative to their size in the direction parallel to the mean flow (large
   aspect ratio, e), and in formations of fine-textured soil materials with
   significant capillary forces (large macroscopic capillary length scale,
   lambda). The relative impact of the chemical heterogeneity of the
   formation on the spreading of the reactive solute, however, is expected
   to increase in formations of coarse-textured soil materials (small
   lambda) and in formations which exhibit a significant stratification
   (small e). This result stems from the fact that when the mean flow is
   vertical, small lambda and small e both diminish the impact of the
   heterogeneity in the physical properties of the formation on the
   variability of the flow in the longitudinal direction.}},

Abstract = {{A reliability algorithm is coupled to a van Genuchten model-based
   unsaturated flow and transport numerical solution to develop a
   probabilistic model of one-dimensional non-reactive and reactive
   contaminant transport in the vadose zone. The reliability approach
   provides two important quantitative results: an estimate of the
   probability that a contaminant concentration is exceeded at some time
   and location, and a probabilistic sensitivity measure which quantifies
   the relative importance of each uncertain variable to the probabilistic
   outcome. The method requires that each uncertain variable be assigned at
   least a mean and standard deviation but marginal distributions and
   correlation structure may be incorporated. Transport through an
   idealized soil column with fixed boundary conditions and constant source
   concentration is analyzed. The uncertain variables include the van
   Genuchten model shape parameters, the saturated and residual water
   contents, saturated hydraulic conductivity, dispersivity, dispersion
   coefficient, first-order decay terms, bulk density and partitioning
   coefficient. The objective is to examine the relative importance of each
   uncertain variable and marginal distributions assigned to each variable.
   The influence of correlation structure is not considered in this study.
   Results indicate that the probabilistic outcome is generally very
   sensitive to likely changes in the saturated water content. Uncertainty
   associated with the diffusion coefficient, residual water content and
   first-order decay coefficients is often not a significant issue with
   respect to the probabilistic outcome; thus, these variables may be
   treated as deterministic constants. Although these results are limited
   by the assumptions of the numerical code and by the conceptual setup of
   the idealized soil column, they provide insight into the critical issues
   to consider in a probabilistic analysis of contaminant transport in the
   vadose zone. Such information concerning the most important uncertain
   parameters can be used to guide field and laboratory investigations.}},

Abstract = {{The transport of reactive solutes at the field scale is
   characteristically nonideal, and this nonideality is often caused by
   more than one factor. In these cases, mathematical models that
   explicitly account for multiple factors are necessary for proper
   simulation of transport and for accurate analysis of causative factors.
   The purpose of this paper is to present a mathematical model for
   simulating the transport of reactive solute in heterogeneous porous
   media. We have taken a multi-scale, multi-factor approach that
   explicitly accounts for such factors as hydraulic-conductivity
   variability, structured porous media, rate-limited diffusive mass
   transfer, and nonlinear, rate-limited, spatially variable sorption. The
   influence of these factors on the displacement and spreading of solute
   plumes and on mass flux is illustrated with a series of two-dimensional
   (vertical) simulations.
   It is shown that rate-limited sorption/mass transfer and nonlinear
   sorption can significantly influence the first, second, and third
   spatial moments, whereas hydraulic-conductivity variability
   significantly influences only the second spatial moment. Plume skewness
   is especially sensitive to the specific factor controlling nonideal
   transport. For example, both rate-limited sorption/mass transfer and
   nonlinear sorption can create negatively skewed plumes during early
   stages of transport. However, the plume influenced by rate-limited
   sorption/mass transfer tends toward symmetry as global residence time
   increases. Conversely, the plume influenced by nonlinear sorption tends
   toward a constant degree of asymmetry as the spreading forces balance
   the concentration-dependent retardation behavior associated with
   nonlinear sorption. Furthermore, the results illustrate that unique
   behavior can result from the coupling of multiple processes. For
   example, when influenced by coupled heterogeneity and nonlinear
   sorption, the shape of a plume may change from positive to negative
   skewness during the course of transport.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in the ambient atmospheric pressure results in subsurface
   motion of air in porous and fractured earth materials. This is known as
   barometric pumping. We analyze this phenomenon for unfractured media and
   demonstrate that if hydrodynamic dispersivity is included, barometric
   pumping can significantly decrease the retention time of volatile
   subsurface contaminants. Formulae are derived which give analytically
   the dependence of the effect on the amplitude and frequency of the
   barometric pump as well as on the material properties. In addition,
   numerical modeling results using a method which carefully avoids
   spurious numerical dispersion are presented. Field data will appear to
   follow a standard diffusive transport model; but in the systems in which
   barometric pumping is significant, the value for D will need to be
   greater than that derived from isobaric tests. In addition to enhancing
   the diffusion, pumping also sweeps out pore gases near the surface and
   thus, reduces the distance a subsurface contaminant must diffuse before
   it mixes with the atmosphere. These barometric pumping mechanisms will
   be enhanced by the presence of fractures, which permit pressure
   variations to propagate deep into the ground. Because barometric pumping
   affects the rate of contaminant transport from the subsurface, this
   process may play an important role in the environmental remediation of
   volatile organic chemicals in the vadose zone.}},

Abstract = {{The application of analytical groundwater solute transport models is
   presented in a case-study in the white-sand aquifer of Rio Maior,
   Portugal.
   Two simultaneous experiments were performed using a conservative and
   non-conservative tracer. The experiments were carried out using an
   innovative technique developed by Lobo-Ferreira (1988, 1989). A measured
   quantity of two different tracers one being considered an ideal tracer
   and the other a non-conservative tracer were injected simultaneously in
   1 m(3) of water from the aquifer into a piezometer, during a measured
   period of time. A injection of 1 m(3) of fresh water from the aquifer
   was injected immediately afterwards. Under regional groundwater flow the
   tracer returned back to the piezometer where the concentration was
   monitored for both tracers.
   The purpose of the experiment is to analyze the different behaviour of
   two tracers with different properties, under the same hydrogeological
   conditions, using a reactive transport model. The ideal tracer
   experimental results obtained served to test if the experimental
   hydrogeological properties of the aquifer, i.e. the velocity and the
   longitudinal dispersivity, used in the model, fit with the experimental
   results. As the model performance was shown to be very accurate, the
   data obtained for the aquifer hydrogeological properties were used in
   the non-conservative tracer modelling.
   The results for the non-conservative modelling were adjusted to the
   field monitoring by changing the initial settings and comparing with the
   field curve by an inverse problem procedure. This allowed us to
   calibrate the non-conservative parameters of the tracer. The results
   obtained in this study illustrate the different behaviour between
   conservative and non-conservative tracers. The two models, CANALX, which
   computes solute spatial profiles, and CANALT, which computes the solute
   breakthrough curve, provide quantitative tools to analyze the behaviour
   and the data for adsorbing solute transport in groundwater. Given
   parameters uncertainties and experimental limitations, we consider the
   model performance to be very encouraging in this application.}},

Abstract = {{First- and second-order reliability methods (FORM and SORM) are applied
   as alternatives to the Monte Carlo simulation method in the
   probabilistic analysis of groundwater contaminant transport and
   remediation. A two-dimensional finite-element model is interfaced with a
   reliability analysis program to account for uncertainty in aquifer
   media. Hydraulic conductivity is modeled as a spatial random field with
   prescribed marginal probability distribution and correlation structure.
   FORM and SORM provide the probability that a contaminant exceeds a
   target level at a well, termed the probability of failure. Sensitivity
   of the probability of failure to basic uncertainty in grid block
   conductivities is also obtained, at no additional computational effort,
   Component reliability is used to analyze failure in a single well.
   Results indicate that, at the most likely failure scenario, grid block
   conductivities attain their maximum value near the source, the receptor
   well, and along the stream tubes connecting the two. System reliability
   is used to analyze the joint probability of failure at several wells in
   the aquifer, Results indicate that system failure probability is greater
   than the largest component failure probability, Correlation between
   component failure events is greater when the individual wells are
   closer, Sensitivity of the upper bound on system probability with
   respect to grid block conductivities is highest along the path the
   contaminant follows to reach the receptor wells, Furthermore, the
   probability of failure to contain a plume from escaping site boundaries
   is analyzed, along with the corresponding sensitivity information.
   Probability of failure to contain the plume decreases as the well
   pumping rate increases, The presence of regions of lower conductivity
   dramatically increases the probability of remediation failure, A careful
   analysis of aquifer material uncertainty and heterogeneity is vital to
   the success of groundwater remediation systems.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work is to investigate the transport of rate-limited
   sorbing solutes in a saturated, aggregated porous medium. Data obtained
   from miscible displacement experiments are used to examine the transport
   of solutes constrained by rate-limited sorption and mass transfer, to
   examine the synergistic effects of two non-ideality factors, and to test
   the capability of a multiprocess non-equilibrium (MPNE) model to
   simulate transport. The input parameters were obtained independently,
   allowing the model to be used in a predictive mode. The independent
   predictions obtained with the MPNE model provided very good descriptions
   of the experimental data for several organic solutes with different
   structures. The effects of multiple non-ideality factors controlling
   solute transport were explored, and flow interruption experiments
   provided additional evidence regarding the synergistic effects of
   rate-limited sorption and rate-limited mass transfer. Our analyses have
   shown quantitatively that both mass distribution and characteristic
   reaction time are important factors influencing transport. Solute
   characteristics controlled the degree to which each factor influenced
   transport behavior for a given porous medium. The velocity dependency of
   the mass-transfer and desorption rate coefficients and the resultant
   impact on solute transport were also examined.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution coefficients (K-d) were measured for cadmium (Cd) and
   nickel (Ni) in laboratory batch experiments for 18 sandy aquifer
   materials at environmentally relevant solute concentrations (Cd: 0.1-15
   mu g/l; Ni: 4-200 mu g/l). The K-d-values ranged three orders of
   magnitude: Cd: 2-1770 l/kg and Ni: 3-7250 l/kg. Correlating observed
   K-d-values to characteristics of the aquifer materials (particle size
   fractions, organic-C content, surface area, pH) revealed very good
   correlation with pH in the pH range 4.9 to 8.9 (Cd: r(2) = 0.942; Ni:
   r(2) = 0.929). including any other of the measured aquifer material
   characteristics did not improve the correlation significantly. The
   results indicate that at the same pH-values, the K-d-values for aquifer
   materials are 4-10 times lower than K-d-values for soils reported in the
   literature. However, the mobility of Cd and Ni, as reflected in the
   K-d-values, is still very limited in sandy aquifers, unless the pH is
   very low. The results indicate that at pH 6 the relative mobility of
   both Cd and Ni is of the order of 1\%.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-96}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Groundwater is being used extensively in the Delhi area for both
   irrigation and raw water requirement. Fluoride contamination in
   groundwater is therefore a matter of concern for the planners and
   managers of water resources, Stable isotope (O-18) and fluoride
   signatures in groundwater have been discussed, in this context, to
   characterise the sources and controlling processes of fluoride
   contamination. The study indicates that almost 50\% of the area is
   affected by fluoride contamination beyond the maximum permissible limit.
   The wide range (0.10-16.5 ppm) in fluoride concentration suggests
   contributions from both point and non-point sources. Very high fluoride
   levels in groundwater are mostly found in the vicinity of brick kilns.
   Significant quantities of evaporated (isotopically enriched) rainfall,
   irrigation water and surface runoff water from surrounding farmland also
   percolate along with fluoride salts from the soils to the groundwater
   system. The process of adsorption and dispersion of fluoride species in
   the soil as well as lateral mixing of groundwater along specific
   flow-paths control the groundwater fluoride and O-18 composition. The
   groundwater system has more than two isotopically distinct non-point
   source origins, causing spatial and temporal variations in fluoride
   concentration. Issues related to harmful effects of excessive use of
   high-fluoride groundwater and management options have also been
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the anaerobic
   biodegradability of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, ortho-, meta- and
   para-xylene (BTEX) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in aquifer sediment down
   gradient of an unlined landfill. The major organic contaminants
   identified in the shallow unconfined aquifer an cis-dichloroethylene
   (c-DCE) and toluene. The biodegradative potential of the contaminated
   aquifer was measured in three sets: of microcosms constructed using
   anaerobic aquifer sediment from three boreholes down gradient of the
   landfill. The degradability of BTEX and TCE was examined under ambient
   and amended conditions, TCE was degraded in microcosms with aquifer
   material from all three boreholes. Toluene biodegradation was
   inconsistent, exhibiting biodegradation with no lag in one set of
   microcosms but more limited biodegradation in two additional sets of
   microcosms, TCE exhibited an inhibitory effect on toluene degradation at
   one location. The addition of calcium carbonate stimulated TCE
   biodegradation which was not further stimulated by nutrient addition.
   TCE was converted to ethylene, a harmless byproduct, in all tests.
   Benzene, ethylbenzene and xylene isomers were recalcitrant in both
   ambient and amendment experiments. Biodegradation occurred under
   methanogenic conditions as methane was produced in all experiments.
   Bromoethane sulfonic acid (BES), a methanogenic inhibitor, inhibited
   methane and ethylene production and TCE biodegradation. The results
   indicate the potential for intrinsic bioremediation of TCE and toluene
   down gradient of the Wilder's Grove, North Carolina, landfill. The low
   concentrations of TCE in monitoring wells was consistent with its
   biodegradation in laboratory microcosms.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of large-scale contamination of groundwater by relatively
   low levels of organic contaminants is most frequently addressed by
   extracting and treating the impacted groundwater. This pump-and-treat
   strategy is often unsuccessful because of difficulties encountered in
   recovering the contaminants from relatively immobile zones within the
   porous medium. These zones can exist at the particle scale, as
   intraparticle or intra-aggregate porosity, and at the larger scales, as
   low-permeability layers or lenses interspersed in substantially more
   permeable layers. This work focuses on achieving an efficient numerical
   solution to a system of groundwater now and contaminant transport
   equations that sufficiently captures the dynamics of slow desorption in
   a two-dimensional porous medium. The conceptual model and governing
   equations are presented. A numerical method for solving the governing
   equations, the upstream-weighted, multiple cell balance (UMCB) method,
   is proposed. The UMCB algorithm has been employed previously for the
   case of solute transport with equilibrium sorption, and is extended here
   to the nonequilibrium case. The approach employs a finite-element basis
   function and a finite-difference local mass balance, and is designed to
   reduce computational and storage requirements, while minimizing the mass
   balance error. The computational grid is formed by division of the flow
   domain into triangular elements. An invented node at the center of each
   clement divides the element into three subtriangular regions. By linking
   the center of each triangular element and the mid-point of each
   elemental side, a multiangular region, referred to as an exclusive
   subdomain, is defined. The discretized system of governing equations is
   derived from the integral form that describes the mass balance in the
   exclusive subdomain of each node. The paper details the application of
   the numerical method, and demonstrates that the method is reasonably
   accurate and computationally efficient for a two-dimensional domain
   subject to nonequilibrium sorption.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a three-dimensional, multicomponent, multiphase
   compositional finite-difference simulator for application to the
   analysis of contaminant transport and surfactant enhanced aquifer
   remediation (SEAR) of nonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL) pollutants.
   Mixtures of surfactant, water and NAPL can form many types of micellar
   and microemulsion phases with a complex and important dependence on many
   variables of which the dilute aqueous solution typically assumed in SEAR
   models is just one example. The phase behavior model is central to our
   approach and allows for the full range of the commonly observed micellar
   and microemulsion behavior pertinent to SEAR. The other surfactant
   related properties such as adsorption, interfacial tension, capillary
   pressure, capillary number and microemulsion viscosity are all dependent
   on an accurate phase behavior model. This has proven to be a highly
   successful approach for surfactant enhanced oil recovery modeling, so it
   was adapted to SEAR modeling. However, there are many significant
   differences between petroleum and environmental applications of
   surfactants, so many new features have been added to model contaminant
   transport and remediation and these are described and illustrated for
   the first time here.}},

Abstract = {{The in situ bioremediation of aquifers contaminated with petroleum
   hydrocarbons is commonly based on the infiltration of groundwater
   supplemented with oxidants (e.g., O-2, NO3-) and nutrients (e.g., NH4+,
   PO43-). These additions stimulate the microbial activity in the aquifer
   and several field studies describing the resulting processes have been
   published. However, due to the heterogeneity of the subsurface and due
   to the limited number of observation wells usually available, these
   field data do not offer a sufficient spatial and temporal resolution. In
   this study, flow-through columns of 47-cm length equipped with 17
   sampling ports were filled with homogeneously contaminated aquifer
   material from a diesel fuel contaminated in situ bioremediation site.
   The columns were operated over 96 days at 12 degrees C with artificial
   groundwater supple mented with O-2, NO3- and PO43-. Concentration
   profiles of O-2, NO3-, NO2-, dissolved inorganic and organic carbon (DIC
   and DOC, respectively), protein, microbial cells and total residual
   hydrocarbons were measured. Within the first 12 cm, corresponding to a
   mean groundwater residence time of < 3.6 h, a steep O-2 decrease from
   4.6 to < 0.3 mg l(-1), denitrification, a production of DIC and DOC,
   high microbial cell numbers and a high removal of hydrocarbons were
   observed. Within a distance of 24 to 40.5 cm from the infiltration, O-2
   was below 0.1 mg l(-1) and a denitrifying activity was found. In the
   presence and in the absence of O-2, n-alkanes were preferentially
   degraded compared to branched alkanes. The results demonstrate that: (1)
   infiltration of aerobic groundwater into columns filled with aquifer
   material contaminated with hydrocarbons leads to a rapid depletion of
   O-2; (2) O-2 and NO3- can serve as oxidants for the mineralization of

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of the chemical composition of recharge sewage
   effluent and associated contaminated groundwater from the Dan Region
   Sewage Reclamation Project shows, after 16 years of recharge operation,
   the presence of a distinct saline plume (up to 400 mg/l Cl), extending
   1600 m downgradient in the Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel. The recorded
   electrolyte composition of groundwater in the vicinity of the recharge
   area reflects the variations in the compositions of the sewage
   effluents, as well as water-rock interactions induced by the recharge of
   treated sewage effluents. The original sewage composition was modified,
   particularly during early stages of effluent migration in the
   unsaturated zone, by cation-exchange and adsorption reactions. Since the
   soil sorption capacity is finite these reactions caused only limited
   modifications, and once the system reached a steady state the inorganic
   composition of the contaminated groundwater became similar to that of
   the recharge water. Decomposition of organic matter in the unsaturated
   zone resulted in CO, generation and dissolution of CaCO3 minerals in the
   aquifer. It was shown that chemical and/or bio-degradation of organic
   matter takes place mainly in the unsaturated (vadose) zone. Hence,
   monitoring the efficiency of the vadose zone to retain contaminants is
   essential for evaluating the quality of groundwater since it was shown
   that organic compounds behave almost conservatively once the effluents
   enter and flow within the saturated zone.}},

Abstract = {{The potential effect of rainfall and evapotranspiration on contaminant
   migration in the unsaturated soil zone was studied using a deterministic
   dynamic modeling approach. The contaminant mass transfer equation was
   solved along with Richards' equation for water transport subject to
   dynamic surface boundary conditions that consider rainfall and
   evapotranspiration. As an illustration of the effect of rainfall and
   evapotranspiration on various transport mechanisms, test cases are
   presented for the transport and volatilization of benzene,
   1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and methanol for a loam-type soil using
   self-consistent dynamic rainfall and evapotranspiration weather
   sequences. The present study suggests that transport mechanisms such as
   diffusion, dispersion and convection can all be significant, to varying
   degrees, during various parts of the year. The temporal variability of
   both the volatilization flux and the amount of chemical remaining in the
   unsaturated soil zone are significantly impacted by the dynamics of
   rainfall and the period of initial contamination.}},

Abstract = {{A wetland at a chromium-contaminated electroplating site was studied to
   determine its ability to immobilize subsurface chromium contamination.
   First, a site characterization was conducted to determine the lateral
   and vertical extent of chromium contamination in the sediment and pore
   water. The wetland was found to be highly contaminated, with sediment
   concentrations of up to 50,000 mu g g(-1). Chromium was partitioned
   largely on the sediment, with K-d's up to 317,000 mL g(-1). No Cr(VI)
   was detected in the pore water. Sequential chemical extractions
   performed on the sediment found 60-90\% of the chromium bound in the
   Fe/Mn-oxide and residual fractions of the soil, with very little
   exchangeable or organic-bound chromium present. These results indicate
   that the chromium is very tightly bound to the sediment. XPS determined
   a very low Cr/Si ratio on the solid surface. Batch leaching experiments
   using the contaminated sediment were conducted at pH 3, 4, and 5.
   Leaching of chromium from the sediment increased with lower pH, ranging
   from 0.02\% to 0.34\% of the total, and appeared to be solubility
   controlled. Results indicate that the wetland has been highly effective
   in immobilizing Cr, by reducing the Cr(VI) and precipitating it as a
   relatively insoluble Cr(III)-hydroxide.}},

Abstract = {{Miscible subsurface contaminant plumes emanating from waste disposal
   sites and landfills can be denser than the ambient groundwater. These
   dense plumes may be either stable or unstable. Since unstable plumes
   contaminate larger regions of an aquifer, it is important to predict
   when gravitational instabilities will occur. In this paper, we propose a
   new criterion to predict gravitational instabilities in the transverse
   mixing zones at the bottoms of dense plumes in porous media. This new
   criterion is based on the existing pi(1) number and a modified Peclet
   number. The experimental results of this study, together with those of
   previous research, seem to show that the proposed criterion is useful
   for prediction purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the removal of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) in the
   subsurface was theoretically simulated using a steady-state
   one-dimensional form of the advection-dispersion-reaction (ADR)
   equation, also accounting for TNT dissolution. The system studied
   consists of equal-sized spherical TNT particles uniformly distributed in
   an anaerobic saturated sediment. Water is assumed to flow steadily and
   uniformly through the sediment. The TNT removal is accomplished by
   biochemical catalysts (enzymes) released by plants. A sensitivity
   analysis was performed by varying TNT particle diameter, soil TNT
   content, Darcy velocity and a first-order biochemical reduction rate
   constant, and studying their effect on the TNT aqueous-phase
   concentration and TNT removal rate from the exposure zone. With zero or
   low biochemical reduction rate constants, it was found that the rate of
   removal of TNT from the exposure zone improved with higher flushing
   rates. On the other hand, higher biochemical reduction rate constants
   resulted in significant reduction of the aqueous TNT concentration at
   all flushing rates and in higher TNT removal rates from the exposure
   zone. A biochemical reduction rate constant of 14.25 day(-1) was
   measured for reduction of dissolved TNT by sediments containing
   biochemical catalysts under anaerobic conditions. A simulation using
   this rate constant suggested the feasibility of in situ phytoremediation
   of TNT-contaminated sediments.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete fracture, saturated-unsaturated numerical model is developed
   where the porous matrix is represented in three dimensions and fractures
   are represented by two-dimensional planes. This allows a fully
   three-dimensional description of the fracture network connectivity,
   Solute advection and diffusion in the porous matrix are also directly
   accounted for, The variably-saturated flow equation is discretized in
   space using a control volume finite-element technique which ensures
   fluid conservation both locally and globally. Because the relative
   permeability and saturation curves for fractures may be highly
   nonlinear, and in strong contrast to those of the matrix, the robust
   Newton-Raphson iteration method is implemented according to the
   efficient procedure of Kropinski (1990) and Forsyth and Simpson (1991)
   to solve the variably-saturated flow equation. Upstream weighting of the
   relative permeabilities is used to yield a monotone solution that lies
   in the physical range and adaptive time stepping further enhances the
   efficiency of the solution process, A time-marching Galerkin
   finite-element technique is used to discretize the solute transport
   equation. Although the methodology is developed in a finite-element
   framework, a finite-difference discretization for both groundwater flow
   and solute transport can be mimicked through a manipulation of the
   influence coefficient technique. The use of an ILU-preconditioned
   ORTHOMIN solver permits the fast solution of matrix equations having
   tens to hundreds of thousands of unknowns. Verification examples are
   presented along with illustrative problems that demonstrate the
   complexity of variably-saturated flow and solute transport in fractured
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{A transient, two-dimensional groundwater flow and contaminant transport
   model is developed here to study DNAPL dissolution in discrete fracture
   networks. The model accounts for matrix diffusion, equilibrium sorption
   and non-linear relative transmissivity effects that influence
   groundwater flow within fractures as the DNAPL disappears, A mixed
   analytical-numerical approach is incorporated to accurately calculate
   the disappearance of the DNAPL from the source fractures by
   aqueous-phase diffusion into the matrix. Locally, equilibrium
   partitioning of the contaminant between the non-aqueous and aqueous
   phases is assumed. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the dissolution
   time of the DNAPL is a function of the flow and transport properties of
   the fracture network and the rock matrix, with the degree of fracture
   connection playing an important role, In relatively porous rock types,
   the DNAPL is removed relatively rapidly from the hydraulically-active
   fractures by matrix diffusion and by aqueous-phase transport along these
   fractures. In poorly connected or dead-end fractures, the rate of
   dissolution of the DNAPL is controlled by matrix diffusion if the rock
   is porous but of low permeability, or by groundwater movement into the
   matrix if the matrix is sufficiently permeable. In all cases,
   dissolution is encouraged by the maintenance of high concentration
   gradients adjacent to the DNAPL source, either naturally or by hydraulic
   manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{Deterministic transport models based on the advection-dispersion
   equation are widely used to simulate groundwater contaminant transport.
   Only the largest heterogeneities and velocity field variations are
   explicitly modeled by the advection part of such models because
   subsurface explorations allow limited understanding of the distribution
   of heterogeneity and velocities. Smaller heterogeneities and associated
   velocity field variations are not incorporated in the modeled velocity
   field, but their overall mixing effect is represented implicitly as
   macrodispersion. As a result, such models do not replicate the complex
   small-scale variation of actual concentration distributions, but instead
   simulate a smoother concentration distribution. This discrepancy causes
   significant uncertainty in modeled concentrations. In this paper, such
   uncertainty is quantified for the detailed concentration distribution
   data sets of the Cape Cod and Borden natural-gradient tracer tests.
   Models of these tests could be made with relatively little uncertainty
   about the source distribution, large-scale flow field, and apparent
   macrodispersivities. As earlier moment analyses reveal, the
   ensemble-average bromide migration in both tests was approximately
   consistent with classical advection-dispersion theory. Therefore, the
   reported uncertainties are primarily due to the use of macrodispersivity
   to represent mixing caused by small-scale velocity field variations.
   Analytic three-dimensional transport models were used to simulate the
   migration of bromide, a non-reactive tracer. The distribution of
   log(c(a)/c(m)), where c(a) is actual concentration and c(m) is modeled
   concentration at the same point, had a standard deviation of similar to
   0.70 for both tests. The distribution of vertically-averaged
   concentration predictions, log(Sigma c(a)/Sigma Zc(m)), where the
   summation is over each multi-level sampler, had a standard deviation of
   similar to 0.45 for both tests. Comparing the peak actual concentration
   to the peak modeled concentration at any given time results in a
   standard deviation of similar to 0.12 in the statistic
   log(c(a(max))/c(m(max))) for both tests. Although the uncertainties
   listed above pertain to the scales of un-modeled velocity variation in
   these models at these sites. the reported uncertainties could serve as
   lower bound estimates for most deterministic model applications.
   Uncertainty due to the assumption of macrodispersive mixing tends to
   increase as the plume scale decreases or as the scale of un-modeled
   velocity field variations increases.}},

Title = {{Uncertainty in recharge estimation: Impact on groundwater vulnerability
   assessments for the Pearl Harbor Basin, O'ahu, Hawai'i, USA}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, uncertainty in recharge estimates is investigated
   relative to its impact on assessments of groundwater contamination
   vulnerability using a relatively simple pesticide mobility index,
   attenuation factor (AF). We employ a combination of first-order
   uncertainty analysis (FOUA) and sensitivity analysis to investigate
   recharge uncertainties for agricultural land on the island of O'ahu,
   Hawai'i, that is currently, or has been in the past, under sugarcane or
   pineapple cultivation. Uncertainty in recharge due to recharge component
   uncertainties is 49\% of the mean for sugarcane and 58\% of the mean for
   pineapple. The components contributing the largest amounts of
   uncertainty to the recharge estimate are irrigation in the case of
   sugarcane and precipitation in the case of pineapple, For a suite of
   pesticides formerly or currently used in the region, the contribution to
   AF uncertainty of recharge uncertainty was compared with the
   contributions of other AF components: retardation factor (RF), a measure
   of the effects of sorption; soil-water content at field capacity
   (Theta(FC)); and pesticide half-life (t(1/2)). Depending upon the
   pesticide, the contribution of recharge to uncertainty ranks second or
   third among the four AF components tested.
   The natural temporal variability of recharge is another source of
   uncertainty in AF, because the index is calculated using the
   time-averaged recharge rate. Relative to the mean, recharge variability
   is 10\%, 44\%, and 176\% for the annual, monthly, and daily time scales,
   respectively, under sugarcane, and 31\%, 112\%, and 344\%, respectively,
   under pineapple. In general, uncertainty in AF associated with temporal
   variability in recharge at all time scales exceeds AF. For chemicals
   such as atrazine or diuron under sugarcane, and atrazine or bramacil
   under pineapple, the range of AF uncertainty due to temporal varisbility
   in recharge encompasses significantly higher levels of leaching
   potential at some locations than that indicated by the AF estimate.}},

Abstract = {{Flow-through column and liquid batch experiments were performed in the
   present study in order to evaluate whether the kinetics of
   biodegradation reactions of organic contaminants for batch conditions
   were comparable to those measured under solid-to-solution ratios
   applicable to aquifer or water-saturated soil systems. The
   biodegradation of benzene, toluene, and xylene was observed under oxic
   conditions. Steady-state reaction rates were determined for the
   biodegradation reactions in the flow-through columns and evaluated using
   a rate law based on the Monod equation for conditions where bacterial
   growth is negligible. Calculated rate constants (k(1)) for
   biodegradation, or substrate disappearance, for sole substrate
   experiments were 1.32 mmol L(-1) h(-1) for benzene, 1.42 mmol L(-1)
   h(-1) for toluene, and 0.833 mmol L(-1) h(-1) for xylene. Rate constants
   were determined for batch experiments using a rate law based on the
   Monod equation that does account for bacterial growth. The maximum
   specific growth rate, mu(max), was found to be similar between batch and
   column experiments, indicating that there were no mass-transport
   limitations in the columns and that the solid-to-solution ratio was not
   a significant factor affecting kinetic parameters. There is considerable
   variability in rate constants for BTX biodegradation reported in the
   literature, up to two orders of magnitude for mu(max). Rate constants
   from this study were within the range of published values. For the
   experiments reported here, rates determined for sole carbon sources
   could be used to predict the reaction rates of BTX mixtures given some
   adjustment of cell yields and lag times.}},

Abstract = {{Before and during soil remediation, frozen soil barriers are used to
   provide containment of liquid contaminants so as to prevent their
   migration to adjacent areas. Questions concerning formation of frozen
   gravelly sand barriers in the vadose zone and barrier resistance to ice
   erosion by liquid contaminants provided the impetus for this study.
   Bench-scale barriers with full and partial ice saturation were studied.
   For comparison, one barrier was formed in gravelly sand using water
   injection;ia a bentonite-water slurry. The bentonite increased the
   slurry viscosity, thereby providing a water retention period suitable
   for freezing. Liquid contaminants included a sodium nitrate solution
   (freezing point of -5 degrees C) and an antifreeze solution (freezing
   point of -33 degrees C), Results showed that ice erosion in the
   bench-scale barriers occurred when the contaminant freezing point
   depression was lower than the temperature of the frozen soil. When
   Liquid contaminants entered the voids of partially ice saturated frozen
   soil, the rate of ice erosion was significantly increased. Full ice
   saturation and barrier temperatures below the freezing point depression
   of the contaminant are needed to minimize ice erosion.}},

Abstract = {{A correction for truncation errors associated with a finite-difference
   solution of the advection-dispersion equation with reaction is developed
   from a Taylor analysis. An explicit finite-difference scheme is used to

   criteria for the stability of the finite-difference solutions are
   derived using a matrix method proposed by Smith (1978).
   Comparison with an analytical solution shows that the uncollected errors
   are not negligible and that by correcting the finite-difference scheme
   for them the results will be more accurate. The approach can also be
   used for correcting other finite-difference schemes whenever they do not

Abstract = {{In the Ellen catchment on the Pinjarra Plain, NE of Perth in Western
   Australia, cadmium from fertilisers is starting to leach from soils.
   About 70\% of surface soils in the Ellen catchment are sandy and often
   on top of a shallow ephemeral water table. Adsorption of Cd in the sandy
   soils of the Ellen catchment was studied by batch adsorption and by
   leaching small columns of soil, Adsorption of Cd increases linearly with
   increasing soil organic matter content and exponentially with increasing
   pH. Cadmium is significantly mobilised in the sandy soils by dissolved
   organic matter.
   The capacity of most of the sandy soils in the Ellen catchment to adsorb
   phosphate from fertiliser hhs been saturated. Resulting concentrations
   in Ellen Brook average similar to 500 mu g L(-1) P, Cadmium is adsorbed
   more strongly in the sandy soils than phosphate and is just starting to
   leach into Ellen Brook. From a comparison of Cd/P ratios in water, soils
   and fertiliser, cadmium concentrations in Ellen Brook are estimated to
   be at 10-30\% of their maximum for complete breakthrough from soils.
   Present concentrations of Cd in Ellen Brook average similar to 0.1 mu g
   L(-1) and are estimated to approach the maximum for complete
   breakthrough in similar to 100 yr, Maximum Cd concentrations in Ellen
   Brook could range from 0.6 to 2 mu g L(-1), depending on rates of input
   with fertiliser and future increases in agricultural land use in the
   catchment.
   Breakthrough curves, resulting from leaching Cd through small columns of
   sandy soil, indicate that adsorption significantly increases the
   effective hydrodynamic dispersion of Cd. Longitudinal dispersivities,
   measured at pore-water velocities of 0.7-14 m day(-1), were similar to 5
   cm for Cd and similar to 0.1-0.2 cm for chloride. The much greater
   dispersion of Cd in the sandy soils than of chloride is shown not to be
   caused by non-equilibrium adsorption.}},

Abstract = {{Several geochemical properties of an aquifer sediment that control
   metal-ion adsorption were investigated to determine their potential use
   as indicators of the spatial variability of metal adsorption. Over the
   length of a 4.5-m-long core from a sand and gravel aquifer, lead (Pb2+)
   and zinc (Zn2+) adsorption at constant chemical conditions (pH 5.3)
   varied by a factor of 2 and 4, respectively. Pb2+ and Zn2+ were adsorbed
   primarily by Fe- and Al-oxide coatings on quartz-grain surfaces. Per
   unit surface area, both Pb2+ and Zn2+ adsorption were significantly
   correlated with the amount of Fe and Al that dissolved from the aquifer
   material in a partial chemical extraction. The variability in
   conditional binding constants for Pb2+ and Zn2+ adsorption (log K-ADS)
   derived from a simple non-electrostatic surface complexation model were
   also predicted by extracted Fe and Al normalized to surface area.
   Because the abundance of Fe- and Al-oxide coatings that dominate
   adsorption does not vary inversely with grain size by a simple linear
   relationship, only a weak, negative correlation was found between the
   spatial variability of Pb2+ adsorption and grain size in this aquifer.
   The correlation between Zn2+ adsorption and grain size was not
   significant. Partial chemical extractions combined with surface-area
   measurements have potential use for estimating metal adsorption
   variability in other sand and gravel aquifers of negligible carbonate
   and organic carbon content.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of exchangeable cation - Na+ and Ca2+ - on the diffusive
   transport of I-, Sr2+ and H-3 (as HTO) in compacted bentonite was
   examined using a through-diffusion method. Total intrinsic diffusion
   coefficients, D-i, were determined from the steady-state flux of the
   diffusants through the clays, and apparent diffusion coefficients, D-a,
   were obtained from the time lag technique. The clays were compacted to a
   dry bulk density of 1.3 Mg/m(3), and Na-bentonite was saturated with a
   solution of 100 mol NaCl/m(3) and Ca-bentonite with one of 50 mol
   CaCl2/m(3). The D-i values for all diffusants are 2 to 6 times higher in
   the Ca- than Na-day. We attribute this to the larger quasicrystal, or
   particle, size of Ca- compared to Na-bentonite. Hence, Ca-bentonite has
   a greater proportion of relatively large pores; this was confirmed by Hg
   intrusion porosimetry. This means the diffusion pathways in Ca-bentonite
   are less tortuous than those in Na-bentonite. Moreover, in some cases
   the effective porosity, or the porosity available for diffusive
   transport, may be greater in Ca-bentonite. The D-a values are inversely
   proportional to the distribution coefficients of the diffusants with the
   clays.}},

Abstract = {{Perchloroethene (PCE) sorption was determined over a wide concentration
   range (similar to 1-90,000 mu g L(-1), or similar to 0.0007-60\% of
   solubility) for four diverse natural clay-rich aquitards using a batch
   method, All of the samples have high content of clay-size materials, and
   were selected to represent a range of fraction organic carbon (f(oc))
   (0.1-3.81\%) and smectite mineral content. Indexing to specific surface
   area (measured by EGME and N-2(g)-BET) or f(oc) could not explain the
   amount or variation of sorption measured. The sorption results were most
   adequately fit over the whole concentration range tested by nonlinear
   Freundlich isotherms with 1/n ranging from 0.72 to 0.95, Trichloroethene
   (TCE) sorption was also measured for one of the aquitard samples.
   Scaling by compound solubility resulted in superposition of the PCE and
   TCE isotherms measured for this sample, suggesting that the driving
   force for sorption was dominantly hydrophobic. Isotherm nonlinearity
   implies that aquitard mass storage will vary with concentration and that
   solute mobility will be concentration-dependent. For example, the PCE
   distribution factor, defined as rho(b)K(d,app)/eta {[}=(bulk
   density){*}(apparent K-d)/(porosity)], predicted for the most nonlinear
   isotherm ranged from 60 to 3 over the measured concentration range.
   Isotherm nonlinearity also suggests that competitive sorption could be
   significant.}},

Abstract = {{Many numerical models which describe the movement of a separate organic
   liquid phase in the subsurface require information about the
   relationships between capillary pressure and saturation, and between
   relative permeability and saturation. An evaluation of the information
   available for these relationships suggests that substantial
   discrepancies may be introduced into simulations if estimated, rather
   than measured, data are employed. The purpose of this study was to
   quantify these deviations. Two-phase displacement simulations were
   performed in one and two dimensions for several organic liquid-water
   systems. Both constant-head and constant-flux boundary conditions were
   employed at a variety of flow rates and time scales, using both
   measurements and estimates of capillary pressure and relative
   permeability for a sandy aquifer material. The results demonstrate that
   the use of estimated transport relationships produces significantly
   different predictions of organic liquid migration. The magnitude of the
   deviations between predictions may be as high as 25\% or more after
   relatively short displacement periods, depending on the boundary
   conditions of the simulated scenario, as well as on the physical
   characteristics of the two-phase system. For the systems examined, most
   of the deviations resulted from the estimates for relative permeability
   to the organic liquid. Thus, improved methods for the estimation of the
   relative permeability to the organic liquid are needed to reduce the
   uncertainty in displacement simulations.}},

Abstract = {{When the electrokinetic method is used to remove metals from soils,
   metals may precipitate as hydroxides in the region of the soil where pH
   is raised, which limits the remediation efficiency. The pH rise is
   caused by the generation of hydroxide ions as a result of electrolysis
   of water during the remediation. This paper proposes a new technique in
   which a conductive solution is inserted between the cathode and the soil
   to be treated. By this approach, the pH in the soil can be kept low so
   that no metal precipitation will occur, Thus metal ions may migrate out
   of the soil and precipitate in the inserted solution. Laboratory
   experiments have been carried out to remove copper and zinc from sand by
   the proposed technique. The experimental results show that metal removal
   efficiencies depend on the duration of the treatment and the content of
   electrolytes in the solution. Metal removal efficiencies of > 96\% can
   be reached for both copper and zinc.}},

Abstract = {{We present results from experiments on the migration of Cs-137 through
   columns containing quartz sand. Times for Cs-137 movement through these
   columns and the quantity of Cs-137 adsorbed by the sand decreased as the
   ionic strength of the pore water increased from 0.002 to 0.1 m. The
   breakthrough curves were characterized by a slow approach towards
   steady-state concentrations as well as by long tails, indicating that
   Cs-137 adsorption to the sand grains was, at least in part, controlled
   by rate-limited reactions, Various formulations for solute mass transfer
   were tested for their ability to fit the experimental breakthrough
   curves. Based on a statistical analysis, a nonlinear, two-site model was
   identified as the most appropriate for describing the suite of
   experimental data, Variation in the model parameter that describes the
   rate of Cs-137 adsorption to the sand showed no consistent pattern with
   changes in ionic strength. In contrast, model parameters describing the
   sorption capacity of the sand grains and the fraction of kinetic
   sorption sites on the sand decreased with increasing ionic strength. The
   parameter describing the rate of Cs-137 desorption varied directly with
   changes in ionic strength.}},

Abstract = {{An advection/dispersion/sorption model incorporating Monod kinetics
   (modified to describe bacterial growth near threshold concentrations of
   the contaminant) was used to analyze breakthrough curve and
   concentration profile data from soil column experiments previously
   reported for degradation of 1,2-dichlorobenzene by Pseudomonas P51. Two
   models for bacterial sorption in the column were compared: one assumed
   an equilibrium process and the other used first-order kinetics for
   adsorption and desorption. Numerical solutions of both models using
   reasonable parameter values represented the column concentration profile
   data well. The two adsorption models yielded qualitatively and
   quantitatively similar results for contaminant concentration data.
   However, significant differences in bacteria distributions and
   breakthrough curves were predicted from the two adsorption models. These
   are important considerations for distinguishing between various models
   of bacterial migration for field-scale applications.}},

Abstract = {{Split-operator approaches are methods in widespread use for numerical
   solutions of reaction/transport problems. However, only a couple of
   analyses of truncation errors resulting from operator splitting have
   been published. A range of linear, single species models is analysed
   here, leading to generalisations of earlier findings, in addition to
   developing new results. Linear retardation, radioactive decay and
   interphase mass transfer are considered in detail. Operator-splitting
   errors for both the standard two-step and alternating two-step methods
   are presented, the latter approach being popular as a way to reduce
   errors due to operator splitting. An ambiguity in implementing two-step
   methods is revealed. The truncation error analysis also shows that the
   application of the usual alternating split-operator method to an
   equilibrium reaction (linear retardation) actually increases the (first
   order in time) truncation error relative to the standard method.
   However, for homogeneous boundary conditions, the same reaction can be
   solved to second-order accuracy if the model derived from taking the
   limit of a nonequilibrium, interphase mass transfer process is used. For
   the linear reactions considered here, the alternating two-step method is
   always second-order accurate in the temporal discretisation.}},

Abstract = {{Free-product recovery system designs for light-hydrocarbon-contaminated
   sites were investigated to evaluate the effects of subsurface
   heterogeneity using a vertically integrated three-phase flow model. The
   input stochastic variable of the areal flow analysis was the
   log-intrinsic permeability and it was generated using the Turning Band
   method. The results of a series of hypothetical field-scale simulations
   showed that subsurface heterogeneity has a substantial effect on
   free-product recovery predictions. As the heterogeneity increased, the
   recoverable oil volume decreased and the residual trapped oil volume
   increased. As the subsurface anisotropy increased, these effects
   together with free- and total-oil contaminated areas were further
   enhanced. The use of multiple-stage water pumping was found to be
   insignificant compared to steady uniform pumping due to reduced recovery
   efficiency and increased residual oil volume. This observation was
   opposite to that produced under homogeneous scenarios. The effect of
   subsurface heterogeneity was enhanced at relatively low water pumping
   rates. The difference in results produced by homogeneous and
   heterogeneous simulations was substantial, indicating greater attention
   should be paid in modeling free-product recovery systems with
   appropriate subsurface heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Effects of high variance of fracture transmissivity on transport and
   sorption at different scales in a discrete model for fractured rocks}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3-D) variable-aperture fracture network model for
   flow and transport in fractured crystalline rocks has been applied to
   study the effects of large variability in fracture transmissivity on
   non-sorbing and sorbing tracer transport, and scale effects in transport
   distance. The variable-aperture character of the fractures is introduced
   into a 3-D network model through a library of single-fracture
   permeabilities and associated particle transport residence time spectra.
   Sorption onto the fracture walls is added by a mathematical model for
   linear sorption. The resulting variable-aperture fracture network model,
   VAPFRAC, can handle flow and transport from single-fracture scale to the
   multiple-fracture scale. The model produces multi-peak transport
   breakthrough curves even for relatively moderate values of the fracture
   transmissivity variance. These breakthrough curves display dispersion on
   two different scales in the same way as has been observed in several
   field experiments conducted in crystalline rocks. The multi-peak
   structure is due to so-called channeling. For high values of the
   fracture transmissivity variance the solute transport is unevenly
   distributed and the channeling effects are more prominent.
   The effect of linear sorption is not just a simple translation in mean
   residence time as in a homogeneous medium. The dispersion
   characteristics of the breakthrough curves also change when linear
   sorption is included. The degree of the change depends strongly on the
   fracture transmissivity variance, as does the translation, In
   particular, with a high fracture transmissivity variance the translation
   in mean residence time due to sorption is significantly smaller compared
   to the cases with a low fracture transmissivity variance. Finally, the
   high variability in the model output data suggests that extrapolation of
   results from a particular tracer experiment will be highly uncertain.}},

Abstract = {{A model for simulating transport of reactive multispecies components has
   been applied to simulate the chemical changes occurring during salt
   water intrusion in a confined aquifer. One-dimensional reactive flow in
   permeable media is simulated by means of a numerical method which
   assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium. The method uses a set of
   partial differential equations, based on the conservation of mass,
   applied to each one of the chemical elements of the system (instead of
   applying them to the chemical species). In this way, the solution of the
   problem is simpler since the term which takes into account the addition
   or loss of mass by reaction is eliminated, The differential equations
   have been solved together with the proposed equilibrium equations, and
   the material and charge balances between the different chemical species
   and elements. The model has been applied to predict and analyze the
   laboratory experimental data of C.A.J. Appelo and coworkers which had
   not been represented exactly using existing models. The model presented
   predicts and explains these experimental data perfectly.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of 2-methylnaphthalene by Rossburg Soil was measured in the
   absence and presence of a nonionic surfactant (Triton(R) X-100).
   Sorption of the surfactant by the sorbent was significant and can be
   adequately described by the Langmuir isotherm equation. At surfactant
   equilibrium concentrations below the critical micelle concentration
   (CMC), sorption of the analyte was enhanced by as much as a factor of 2.
   At high surfactant dosages, the formation of micelles enhanced the
   aqueous-phase concentration of the sorbate thereby decreasing its
   sorption by the soil. A reduction in the analyte partition coefficient
   by as much as a factor of 3 was observed at a surfactant dosage of 3000
   mg/L. A simple three-phase model was used to estimate the effects of
   surfactants on the sorption of nonpolar organic compounds. This model
   also took into account the effect of the surfactant on sorbent
   properties. The model results suggest that very hydrophobic substances
   (K-ow > 10(5.0)) were most sensitive to the effects of the surfactant
   with regard to enhanced sorption below the equilibrium CMC and increases
   in solution-phase concentration above the CMC. Moreover, it appears that
   lower relative surfactant dosages above the CMC are required to
   effectively mobilize these types of pollutants.}},

Abstract = {{A site located in Hanahan, South Carolina, U.S.A., was contaminated in
   1975 by JP-4 jet fuel. These coastal plain sediments are comprised of
   unconsolidated, fine-grained sands, but have interfingering lenses of
   clay. Heterogeneity in subsurface sediment grain size and contaminant
   distribution was examined in sediment collected in adjacent boreholes at
   discrete depth intervals (15-20 cm) in the saturated zone. Sediments
   were analyzed for JP-4 and for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene
   (BTEX) by GC-MS, and for sediment grain size to determine percentages of
   sand vs. clay and silt. Spatial heterogeneities in sediment grain size
   were found on a small vertical scale in adjacent boreholes, and between
   boreholes separated by 21-m distance, although coastal plain sediments
   are considered to be homogeneous. Jet fuel contamination was positively
   correlated with clay content of the sediment. In addition,
   biodegradation of radiolabeled amino acids, toluene and benzene was
   measured in laboratory microcosms from sediment collected from
   contiguous depths from a single borehole in the same area.
   Biodegradation of the three substrates was less in the predominantly
   clay sample than that in the sandy sample. Increased sorption and
   limited biodegradation may contribute to higher concentrations of
   contaminants in clay sediments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents improvements in the `'classical boundary layer''
   (CBL) approximation method to obtain simple but robust initial
   characterization of aquifer contamination processes. Contaminants are
   considered to penetrate into the groundwater through the free surface of
   the aquifer. The improved method developed in this study is termed the
   `'top specified boundary layer'' (TSBL) approach. It involves the
   specification of the contaminant concentration at the top of the
   contaminated `'region of interest'' (ROI), which is simulated as a
   boundary layer. The TSBL modification significantly improves the ability
   of the boundary layer method to predict the development of concentration
   profiles over both space and time.
   The TSBL method can be useful for the simulation of cases in which the
   contaminant concentration is prescribed at the aquifer's free surface as
   well as for cases in which the contaminant mass flux is prescribed at
   the surface.}},

Abstract = {{In specific zones of the Oklo uranium deposit, criticality was naturally
   reached 2 Ga ago. This site thus provides a unique opportunity to show
   whether the stable nuclear reaction end-products have remained or not in
   the vicinity of the reactor zones after the termination of nuclear
   reactions. In addition, the evaluation of the stability of the uraninite
   matrix over very long periods of time provides information on the
   possible long-term stability of waste forms such as spent fuel. The
   Commission of the European Communities initiated in 1991 the Oklo
   Natural Analogue Programme, a part of which is devoted to present-day
   migration studies. The Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company
   (SKB) supports this programme, with special interest in the Bangombe
   reactor, a shallow reaction zone possibly affected by surficial
   alteration processes. The Oklo study comprises hydrogeology, groundwater
   chemistry, isotopic analyses (environmental isotopes, U series,
   U-235/U-238), and modelling. Two sites are being thoroughly
   investigated: the less perturbed OK84 reactor zone in Okelobondo (200 m
   south from Oklo) and the Bangombe reactor zone, 30 km south of Oklo. We
   focus our study on uranium migration from these reactor zones, using
   tracers such as the U-235/U-238 isotope ratio. After preliminary field
   campaigns, a conceptual model was constructed, both for Okelobondo and
   Bangombe. For this purpose, groundwaters have been characterised for
   three years in different areas around Oklo: Okelobondo groundwaters in
   mines and boreholes and surface waters, and Bangombe, both in boreholes
   and surface waters. Detailed investigations were then conducted in order
   to validate our conceptual models, and finally to enabling us to model U
   migration from the reaction zones, and to evaluate the performance
   assessment of deep geological disposal of radioactive wastes. After the
   presentation of regional and local geology and hydrogeology, we give a
   complete description and interpretation of groundwater chemical
   evolution both in Okelobondo and Bangombe. It concerns major-element
   behaviour, redox control and uranium behaviour. Preliminary conclusions
   for the conceptual model drawn from hydrogeological studies and from
   groundwater chemistry agree closely. In addition, we have successfully
   tested the use of U-235/U-238 isotope ratios in groundwaters to evaluate
   the migration of uranium from reactor zones.}},

Abstract = {{A near-field release model is developed both conceptually and
   mathematically. The model is tested against known helium release from
   the Cigar Lake uranium ore deposit. The release and transport of various
   aqueous species (including some radionuclides) in the deposit are
   studied by using this model. The uranium release rate predicted by the
   model is extremely low, which is consistent with field observations. In
   modelling the release of three other radionuclides (H-3, C-14 and
   Cl-36), the in situ generation and decay are taken into account. The
   measured concentration gradients of hydrogen was used to estimate the
   net rate of radiolysis. The simultaneously formed oxidising species are
   found in sulphates formed by oxidation of sulphides. There is a good
   agreement of the estimated rate of formation of the reducing component
   hydrogen and the oxidising component as found in the sulphate.}},

Abstract = {{The role played by the petrophysical characteristics of the rock matrix
   in the radioelement transfer phenomena through the geosphere is
   considered. The aim of this paper is to correlate information provided
   by the microcrack network, mineralogy and U-micromapping studies which
   can be used to quantify the extent of radioelement migration/retention
   in the granite. This study is part of an interdisciplinary research
   project on the El Berrocal site (Spain), which forms part of the R\&D
   Programme `'Management and Disposal of Radioactive Waste'' of the
   Commission of the European Communities.
   The experimental procedure combines complementary microscopic
   techniques: polarizing light, fluorescence, confocal laser scanning,
   acoustic, scanning electron microscopy and uranium-induced fission-track
   micromapping. All of these techniques are applied for quantifying the
   rock matrix characteristics.
   Data on preferential fissure zones in relation to mineralogy, and the
   correlation between these data and uranium microdistribution are
   obtained. These results are discussed in terms of radionuclide mobility
   and can be used, with other information, for evaluating the retardation
   capacity of the crystalline rock matrix around a high-level radioactive

Abstract = {{Current design concepts for low-/intermediate-level radioactive waste
   disposal in many countries involve emplacement underground in a
   cementitious repository. The highly alkaline groundwaters at Maqarin,
   Jordan, are a good analogue for the cementitious pore waters that will
   be present within such a repository. A geochemical modelling study of
   these groundwaters has been carried out in order to test the
   applicability of equilibrium models in geochemical programs and their
   associated thermodynamic databases in such hyperalkaline conditions.
   This was achieved by comparison of elemental solubilities and
   speciations predicted by the programs with observations in the natural
   system. Five organisations took part in the study: AEA Technology, U.K.;
   Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden; MBT Tecnologia Ambiental,
   Spain; Nagra, Switzerland; and SKB, Sweden. The modelling study was
   coordinated by the University of Berne.
   The results of the study showed good agreement between the predictions
   of the programs employed. Comparison of the observed solids with those
   predicted by the models has allowed limited validation of the databases.
   The results for U and Se are presented here.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion of contaminants from fractures into the interconnected
   wall-rock porosity is an important retardation process in geosphere
   transport. Contaminant immobilization can also be achieved at a redox
   front, owing to contrasting solubilities of reduced and oxidized species
   along with sorption and coprecipitation on secondary phases produced at
   the front. Here, a natural analogue study is presented that demonstrates
   the applicability of these concepts to potential sedimentary host
   formations for a high-level radioactive waste repository in Switzerland.
   The existence of matrix diffusion to at least 0.08 m into the wall rock
   (the full length of the profile examined) is demonstrated on the basis
   of mineralogical and porosimetric evidence, pore-space geometry and
   disequilibria in the U-238-and Th-232-decay series. Radioactive
   disequilibria are due to at least two distinct processes, namely
   pervasive U-234 and Ra-228 leaching throughout the rock along with U
   deposition around the redox fronts.}},

Abstract = {{For several years tracer migration experiments are performed at Nagra's
   Grimsel Test Site in the Swiss Alps as a joint undertaking of Nagra, PNC
   and PSI. The aim is to develop methods for field experiments at possible
   sites for nuclear waste repositories and to test radionuclide transport
   models.
   A hydraulic dipole field is generated in a well-defined fracture zone in
   granite. The tracers used are non-sorbing (uranine, He-3, He-4,
   Br-82(-), I-123(-)), mildly sorbing (Na-22(+), Na-24(+)), and more
   strongly sorbing (Sr-85(2+), Rb-86(+), Cs-134(+), Cs-137(+)). These
   experiments have been complemented by extensive laboratory
   investigations on petrography, on water-rock and nuclide-rock
   interaction as well as by migration experiments with bore cores.
   The main questions addressed are: What are the relevant geometric
   factors and mechanisms for transport, how well can breakthrough curves
   be extrapolated from one dipole arrangement to another, which parameters
   are scale dependent, is there a difference in sorption values between
   laboratory and field experiments or between static and dynamic
   experiments. Evaluating the experimental results for the non-sorbing
   uranine and the mildly sorbing tracers Sodium and Strontium, we show
   that a consistent picture of tracer transport, and specifically of
   tracer sorption, is obtained when exploiting all available experimental
   information and using not too simplistic models.}},

Abstract = {{It is anticipated that the U.K. radioactive waste repository will be
   sited in a saturated low-permeability fractured geology. The repository
   will contain material that will give rise to the generation of
   significant quantities of gas over an extended period of time. It is
   important to understand the mechanisms whereby these gases are released
   from the repository and migrate away. If the gases were to be localised
   at surface they could potentially pose radiological, toxicological or
   flammability risks to man.
   This paper discusses experimental and modelling studies of gas migration
   in water-saturated fractured rock. A field-scale helium gas injection
   experiment has been undertaken at a test site in a disused quarry. The
   aims of the experiment were to establish whether gas injected at depth
   was localised on release at the land surface, and to contribute to
   building confidence in the models being developed to describe gas
   migration processes. Gas was injected for nine days and throughout this
   period and the subsequent twelve months soil-gas surveying was used to
   establish release locations. Data from the experiment have been modelled
   using a number of approaches ranging from analytical scoping
   calculations to numerical simulations of two-phase flow in a porous
   medium. These approaches have proved useful in modelling gas injection
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Entrance tunnel construction at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory opened a
   conductive vertical fracture zone at a depth of 70 m on March 13, 1991.
   Three weeks later a sharp dilution front corresponding to 80\% shallow
   water inflow to the originally saline fracture zone arrived at the
   entrance tunnel depth. In spite of this large inflow of shallow water,
   the fracture zone has remained persistently anoxic over a subsequent 2
   1/2-year period. Results from gas sampling and C-14 dating of dissolved
   organic and inorganic carbon conclusively show that recent organic
   carbon is being transported into the fracture zone and oxidized to
   carbon dioxide. These results are important when considering possible
   changes of redox status in the deep groundwater environment during
   construction and operation of a repository for spent nuclear fuel.
   Opening this fracture zone to large-scale surface water inflow adds
   reducing capacity in the form of organic carbon. This implies that the
   soil cover may provide important protection against input of dissolved
   oxygen to fractures being drained during the open phase of the
   repository.}},

Abstract = {{Selenium (VI) migration through drill-core columns of granite was
   investigated as a function of water velocities under oxic and anoxic
   conditions. The measurement of Se(VI) recovery at the column outlet
   showed that a loss due to adsorption occurred. Comparison with the
   breakthrough curves of conservative tracers indicated that
   nonequilibrium of the sorption reaction did not contribute to the
   observed dependence of Se(VI) retention from the water velocity. A
   kinetically controlled redox transformation of Se(VI) to more strongly
   adsorbed Se species was postulated.
   Adsorption studies of selenate with pure minerals representative of
   granite weathering products indicated that iron sulfide inclusions can
   be important adsorbents for Se(VI). Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption
   spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that partial reduction of Se(VI)
   to Se(II) and Se(IV) occurred at the mineral surface.}},

   reactions between aqueous Cr(VI) and two iron oxides, goethite and

   on pH and the redox properties of the surface. For goethite the surface
   was quickly saturated and no further adsorption observed. Chromate anion
   (CrO42-) exhibited Langmuir-type adsorption. For magnetite, a
   significant slow steady-state rate of Cr(VI) uptake was observed. We
   propose two different mechanisms of chromium uptake: surface
   complexation of Cr(VI) species on goethite, and reductive precipitation

Abstract = {{A radionuclide migration experiment was performed over a distance of 1 m
   in a natural fracture in a quarried block of granite. The fracture in
   the block was characterized hydraulically by measuring the pressure drop
   in borehole-to-borehole pump tests. The effective fracture volume in the
   block was similar to 100 mL. A silicone coating was applied to the
   exterior, and the block was immersed in a tank of water to which
   hydrazine was added to provide a chemically reducing barrier. Migration
   experiments were performed at a flow rate of 2.2 mL h(-1) using Sr-85,
   I-131, Cs-137, Ce-144, Eu-152, Np-237 and Pu-238. A total of 9.5 L of
   groundwater was pumped through the fracture, corresponding to similar to
   95 fracture volumes. only Sr-85, I-131, Cs-137, Np-237 and Pu-238 were
   observed in the eluent. Scanning of the fracture surface at the end of
   the migration experiment showed limited mobility of alpha-emitting
   radionuclides and of the rare-earth elements, consistent with static
   sorption data obtained on representative fracture surface material. The
   mobility of Cs-137 was higher than that of the rare-earth elements, but
   it was lower than that of Sr-85. When samples of fracture-coating
   material were separated into fractions with different specific gravity,
   there was a clear indication of radionuclide association with mineral
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{The transient transport of trace radiocalcium and radiostrontium in a
   clayey and calcareous sandy soil is mainly governed by: (1) cation
   exchange with the major cations on clay minerals; (2) calcocarbonic
   equilibria which control the concentration of calcium in the leaching
   solution; and (3) the initial composition of the leaching solution. If
   there are no changes in the concentration of the major cations and pH
   and ionic composition are stable, it is possible to calculate a
   distribution coefficient (K-d) as a function of the major cations. In a
   constant physicochemical environment, this coefficient can be introduced
   in a linear transport model. Chromatographic experiments have been
   performed in which pulse injections of radiostrontium or radiocalcium
   are made into sand columns fed with various leaching solutions. The
   results are compared: (1) with the simulations based on a complete
   speciation model; and (2) with predictions from a linear model including
   the previously calculated K-d. The shape and the location of
   radionuclide peaks are well simulated for a large range of ionic
   composition (10(-3)-10(-1) M for a mixture of CaCl2 and NaCl).
   The distribution of clay minerals in the porous medium is of great
   importance. The local equilibrium assumption only holds when clay
   minerals particles are uniformly distributed on the sand grains. Kinetic
   effects occur when clays are in the form of aggregates. These effects
   are evaluated by means of a first-order transfer model and by comparison
   with tracer tests at different flow rates.}},

Abstract = {{Various construction materials are under consideration for nuclear waste
   repositories. Two important materials are concrete and bentonite clay,
   which will act as mechanical barriers and prevent convective water flow.
   These barriers will also retard transport (diffusion controlled) of
   dissolved radionuclides by a combination of mechanical constraints and
   chemical interactions with the solid.
   An important issue is the possible change of the initial sodium
   bentonite into the calcium form due to interaction with calcium from the
   concrete. The initial leaching of concrete was studied using radioactive
   spiked concrete in contact with compacted bentonite.
   Measurement were made of the diffusion of Cs, Am and Pu into 5 different
   types of concrete in contact with pore water. The diffusivity measured
   for Cs agrees reasonably well with data found in the literature. No
   movement could be measured for Am and Pu (< 0.2 mm), even though the
   contact times were extremely long (2.5 and 5 yr, respectively). The
   diffusion of Na, Ca and Cs from concrete into bentonite was also
   measured.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the dissolution of biotite and chlorite in laboratory systems
   with flow-through and batch reactors. The initial dissolution of biotite
   in the near-neutral pH region, under N-2(g) atmosphere is highly
   non-stoichiometric. A slow linear release of iron during a period of
   weeks indicates a surface-chemical-reaction-controlled mechanism of
   release for iron. The release of potassium is much faster than that of
   iron. A parabolic dependence of accumulated release with time suggests a
   diffusion-controlled mechanism of potassium release. The rates of
   magnesium, aluminium and silicon release are between those for potassium
   and iron and approach that of iron with time. There is no significant
   influence of (bi)carbonate or pH on biotite dissolution rate or
   stoichiometry in the pH region 7 < pH < 8.5. The release rates of
   elements from chlorite are close to stoichiometric and similar to the
   iron release rate from biotite. In closed batch reactors at near-basic
   pH the composition of test solutions in contact with biotite is
   apparently controlled by gibbsite (Al), kaolinite (Si) and
   Fe(III)-(hydr)oxide. We estimated a turn-over time (10(1)-10(2) yr) for
   molecular oxygen and a time scale (10 months) to develop characteristic
   Fe(II) concentrations for a granitic groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{A series of core flood experiments has been performed to investigate the
   migration behaviour of uranium under rigidly controlled conditions.
   Intact sandstone cores, pre-equilibrated with synthetic groundwater,
   were flooded with uranium solutions at varying concentrations and the
   transport process monitored as a function of pH, tracer concentration
   and the concentration of a competing ion, cadmium. In each case a
   substantial amount of uranium was retained by the core, implying a
   strong interaction with the rock matrix. The adsorption process was
   found to be highly concentration dependent; however, such that the
   finite retention capacity of an intact core can be exhausted within a
   relatively short time. The reversibility of uptake was studied by
   attempting to displace adsorbed uranium by injected cadmium and flushing
   with brine. Most of the uranium was readily recoverable but a small
   percentage is released very slowly on flushing, suggesting conversion to
   a more stable form.
   Prior to performing each experiment a simulation was carried out using a
   one-dimensional coupled chemical transport code, encompassing a
   thermodynamic description of the electrical double layer. The model was
   successful in predicting a priori the dominant trends in the uranium
   migration behaviour which may aid in model developments for more complex
   geochemical regimes than those studied here.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of

   packed columns. Submicrometre size particles, goethite (alpha-FeOOH),
   were used to represent the colloids. The radionuclides were Cs-137, N-22

   affecting goethite transport. At low pH, goethite is strongly retained
   by the quartz. At high pH, the breakthrough of goethite followed
   predictions based on the electrostatic repulsion between the colloids
   and the quartz. In addition, the flow rate and the initial goethite
   colloid concentration influenced the colloid breakthrough from the
   quartz column.
   There is not any similarity between either sodium and goethites or
   cesium and goethites breakthrough curves. The transport of iodate,

Abstract = {{We consider the dispersion and elution of colloids and dissolved
   nonsorbing tracers within saturated heterogeneous porous media. Since
   flow path geometry in natural systems is often ill-characterized
   macroscopic (mean) flow rates and dispersion tensors are utilized in
   order to account for the sub-model scale microscopic fluctuations in
   media structure (and the consequent hydrodynamic profile). Even for
   tracer migration and dispersal this issue is far from settled.
   Here we consider how colloid and tracer migration phenomena can be
   treated consistently. Theoretical calculations for model flow geometries
   yield two quantitative predictions for the transport of free (not yet
   captured) colloids with reference to a non-sorbing dissolved tracer
   within the same medium: the average migration velocity of the free
   colloids is higher than that of the tracer; and that the ratio of the
   equivalent hydrodynamic dispersion rates of colloids and tracer is
   dependent only upon properties of the colloids and the porous medium, it
   is independent of pathlengths and fluid flux, once length scales are
   large enough.
   The first of these is well known, since even in simple flow paths free
   colloids must stay more centre stream. The second, if validated suggests
   how solute and colloid dispersion may be dealt with consistently in
   macroscopic migration models. This is crucial since dispersion is
   usually ill-characterized and unaddressed by the experimental
   literature. In this paper we present evidence based upon an existing
   Drigg field injection test for the validity of these predictions.
   We show that starting from experimental data the fitted dispersion rates
   of both colloids and non-sorbing tracers increase with the measured
   elution rates (obeying slightly different rules for tracers and
   colloids); and that the ratio of colloid and nonsorbing tracer elution
   rates, and the ratio of colloid and nonsorbing tracer dispersion rates
   may be dependent upon properties of the colloids and the medium (not the
   flow regime).
   It is important to realize that even for unretarded species, an earlier
   peak in the breakthrough curve does not necessarily correspond to a
   faster mean elution rate, or vice versa. But rather that a colloid may
   elute faster but disperse less than an equivalent tracer. Hence its peak
   may be retarded compared to that of the tracer, even assuming no
   retardation. Hence one must consider a combination of mean elution rate
   and mean dispersion rate, and not rely on `'peak times'' to corroborate
   chromatographic effects. The importance of this lies in the fact that
   these processes are not independent and yet upscale differently. Thus
   realistic estimates of effective colloid dispersion rates should be
   upscaled in a way consistent with that adopted for tracers within the
   same system.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of the transport of radioelements sorbed on colloids often
   occurs when assessing the safety of radioactive waste disposal. A
   methodology for studying the influence of particles on the transport of
   solute is proposed. A salinity gradient of NaCl is flowed through a
   chromatographic column filled with a mixture of sand and bentonite clay
   (5\% by weight). As long as the NaCl concentration stays above a
   threshold value equal to 0.16 M, no particle migration out of the column
   is detected. A dramatic variation of the hydrodynamic properties of the
   column occurs just before the output of the clay particles: preferential
   pathways and dead water volumes are formed. The clay migration is first
   detected when NaCl concentration is < 0.16 M, and it is then controlled
   by varying NaCl concentration. For a given length and composition of the
   porous medium, the amount of clay that migrates depends only on the NaCl
   concentration of the feed solution. An empirical function is proposed to
   account for this. This function is included in a transport model to
   account for kinetic mass transfer between immobile and mobile water
   zones, and adsorption of trace solute such as cesium. The adsorption is
   assumed to be governed by cation exchange with sodium. This built model
   is in good agreement with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the mobility of colloids (0.001-0.45 mu m) and suspended
   particles (> 0.45 mu m) in granite fractures, laboratory
   particle-migration and conservative tracer studies have been carried out
   in a natural fracture within a large granite block, with overall
   dimensions of 83 X 90 X 60 cm. Flow fields within this horizontal
   fracture were controlled through a set of 9 boreholes drilled
   orthogonally to the fracture. Laboratory experiments were performed
   using a range of average water velocities which contained values low
   enough to closely approximate the natural flow velocities of (2 m yr(-1)
   in plutonic rocks of the Canadian Shield. The particles used had
   diameters between 0.02 and 22 mu m, and included latex spheres, glass
   spheres and colloidal silica. Migration experiments were carried out
   with a filtered groundwater, ionic strength of 0.01 mol kg(-1), obtained
   from a granite fracture within the Whiteshell Research Area of Manitoba.
   Flushing experiments showed that suspended particles as large as 40 mu m
   could be mobilized from the fracture surface. The mobility of suspended
   particles was significantly less than that of colloids. However, within
   the size range of colloids used in these studies (0.022-0.090 mu m),
   colloid size did not affect colloid migration. Although, in general,
   colloids eluted ahead of the conservative tracer, colloid mobility was
   significantly reduced when the average groundwater velocity dropped
   below between 32 and 240 m yr(-1). Colloid transport was found to be
   very sensitive to flow path and flow direction.}},

Abstract = {{We consider fully coupled geochemical process systems, and show how they
   may be cast as differential algebraic systems amenable to numerical
   solution.
   Considering reactive transport within engineered barriers, we motivate
   problems: (1) involving (some) kinetic reactions; (2) in two or more
   spatial dimensions; (3) incorporating spatial heterogeneity; and (4)
   with full coupling.
   The examples considered illustrate the possible treatment of spatial
   heterogeneity (which causes both channelled flow and stagnant water);
   the treatment of air-water interfaces as moving-boundaries; corrosion at
   interfaces; nonlinear feedback when the geochemical and flow problems
   are full coupled, and the formation of fingering patterns.
   Our preliminary calculations indicate that such problems are numerically
   tractable. However, verification and the availability of suitable data
   remain outstanding issues. Even though these problems are nonlinear,
   there is range of analytical tools available, and some aspects of the
   solution can be known quantitatively as well as qualitatively.}},

Abstract = {{The Fracture-Matrix Transport (FMT) code couples saturated porous medium
   advection and diffusion with mechanistic chemical models for speciation
   and interphase reactions. Previous versions of FMT simulated
   double-porosity transport in two dimensions on the continuum from
   advection- to diffusion-dominate, with a user-specified velocity field
   to allow double-porosity transport. However, aqueous density was assumed
   constant, and reactive minerals were assumed to occupy negligible
   volume. Both of these assumptions can be considered poor for evaporite
   systems, where large changes in porosity and aqueous density can result
   from high mineral solubilities. Further development of FMT has relaxed
   these restrictions, allowing aqueous density to vary with phase
   composition, and allowing void volume to change as minerals dissolve and
   precipitate. This paper describes the additional mathematical complexity
   and code modifications required to simulate such systems. The
   sensitivity of advection-dominated transport to these variables is
   explored briefly in a one-dimensional example.}},

Abstract = {{Available experimental data indicate that radionuclide sorption is a
   complex function of mineral and solution chemistry. Surface complexation
   models (SCM's) can be used to describe this sorption behavior, but
   comparison of model results requires interpretation of these data using
   a consistent set of model parameters. Based on available potentiometric
   titration data, a uniform approach is used to develop a set of
   consistent parameters for three SCM's and nine simple (hydr)oxides.
   Using these parameters, all three models prove capable of reproducing
   observed charge data, but each model is subject to limitations. Binding
   constants are developed for the U(VI)-H2O-CO2-goethite system. In the
   absence of CO2, all three models are able to reproduce observed trends
   for a given data set assuming a single surface complex. Two or more
   surface complexes were required to model observed sorption behavior in
   the presence of CO2/CO32-. The experimental data from the two studies
   considered differ, and binding constants based on combining modeling
   results do not perform as well, exhibiting bias towards the larger data
   set. For more complex minerals, sorption of Np(V) on biotite and U(VI)
   on kaolinite were well modeled using the simplest SCM and assuming
   stoichiometric proportions of silanol (SiOH0) and aluminol (AlOH0)

   are defined, there are very large ranges in the values selected for most
   elements (several orders of magnitude). In some cases, differences in
   solubilities can be attributed to differences in the thermodynamic
   databases used but, due to generally incomplete documentation, both of
   such databases and the criteria for data selection, detailed analysis of
   the reason for such discrepancies is precluded. A key factor, however,
   is the fairly subjective choice of the solid phase considered to be
   `'solubility-limiting''. Procedures are recommended which would increase
   the transparency of solubility database compilation in future analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Around 76\% of the world's population lives in developing countries
   where more fertilizer-N is currently applied than in developed
   countries. Fertilizers are applied preferentially in regions where
   irrigation is available, and soil and climatic conditions are favorable
   for the growth of crop plants. Due to low N application rates during the
   last 3 or 4 decades, negative N balances in the soil are a
   characteristic feature of the crop production systems in developing
   countries. In the future, with increasing fertilizer-N application
   rates, the possibility of nitrate pollution of groundwater in developing
   countries will be strongly linked with fertilizer-N use efficiency. A
   limited number of investigations from developing countries suggest that,
   in irrigated soils of Asia or in humid tropics of Africa, the potential
   exists for nitrate pollution of groundwater, especially if fertilizer-N
   is inefficiently managed. In a large number of developing countries in
   West and Central Asia and North Africa, the small amount of fertilizer
   applied to soils (mostly Aridisols) that remain dry almost all the year,
   do not constitute a major threat for nitrate pollution of groundwater,
   except possibly when soils are irrigated. In Asia and the Pacific
   regions, where 70\% of the fertilizers are used to grow wetland rice on
   soils with low percolation rates, leaching of nitrates is minimal.
   Climatic water balance and soil moisture conditions do not favor
   leaching of nitrates from the small amount of fertilizer-N applied to
   Oxisols and Ultisols in Latin America:rn developing countries located in
   the humid tropics, attempts have not been made to correlate fertilizer-N
   use with nitrate level in groundwater; however, fertilizers are being
   increasingly used. Besides high rainfall, irrigation is becoming
   increasingly available to farmers in the humid tropics and substantial
   leaching of N may also increase.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen is widely used in agricultural practice in different organic
   and inorganic forms to enhance crop productivity. After the growing
   season, a part of the nitrogen remains in forms sensitive to changes of
   the conditions, such as nitrate. In years with above-average
   precipitation a significant amount of nitrate can leave the rooting zone
   of various crops even when land is cropped annually. Integration of
   knowledge related to environmental conditions of a certain area with the
   soil, water and crop management practices helps to prevent the
   simultaneity of the unfavourable processes leading to nitrate leaching,
   thus water resources may be protected from nitrate pollution of
   agricultural origin. It is of increasing importance that such an
   approach be applied in the Hungarian crop production. Since the great
   spatial variability of soil-forming factors is clearly reflected by the
   heterogeneous (sometimes mosaic-like) soil cover in Hungary,
   differentiation of categories within the soil types is strongly needed
   for agricultural practices. Basic features of a computerized fertilizer
   recommendation system developed in RISSAC to characterize the soil
   fertility levels in Hungary are: classification of the soils into a new
   land-site category system characterized by 4-digit codes, and also into
   aggregated land-site groups with regard to the major plant nutrients;
   and characterization of the nutrient status of soil by establishing
   nutrient supply categories which consider also the fertilizer
   requirements of the main crops. Since during the last few decades
   Hungarian farmers have applied more N-P-K fertilizers than the crops
   required, and at the same time there was a large increase in other
   potential pollution sources, harmful side-effects such as unfavourable
   changes in the quality of surface and subsurface water resources were
   detected. Hence, it was imperative to develop methods to calculate N
   balances which take into account the amount of N originating from other
   sources than the applied mineral fertilizers and also N output via
   nitrate leaching down the soil profile. Comparison of the results of
   several long-term field trials conducted simultaneously at several
   experimental sites which differed in environmental characteristics such
   as soil type and climatic conditions was shown to provide a good basis
   for a more generalized quantification of the overall turnover of
   nitrogen and for calculating improved N balances. The results indicated
   that when the rational use of organic manures and N-containing
   fertilizers is based on the plant's N demand, the nitrogen balances are
   in equilibrium. The amount of N needed to obtain economically viable
   yields, while at the same time being in balance with the requirements of

Abstract = {{Deep percolation of nitrate can contribute to the deterioration of
   groundwater resources. Leaching of nitrate is a complex process affected
   by fertilizer and irrigation practices, efficiency of N use by the crop,
   and how the soil's water holding capacity and water transmission
   properties are affected by soil texture. Depleted ((NH4)-N-15)(2)SO4
   fertilizer at N rates of 0, 125, 250 and 375 kg ha(-1) was applied
   annually for 3 years to continuous corn grown within three different
   water regimes. This time period and the labeled N permitted an
   evaluation of N use efficiency by the crop and NO3 leaching and
   carryover on a Weld silty clay loam, a fine-textured soil, typical of
   the `'hardland'' soils of the semi-arid Great Plains. Three water
   regimes, W-1, (similar to 1.5 ET), W-3 (similar to ET) and W-3 (similar
   to 0.8 ET), were used. Beneath each plot within each water regime,
   Duke-Haise vacuum trough extractors were installed under undisturbed
   soil profiles at 1.22-m depth to measure weekly percolate and the NO3
   concentration in the percolate. The corn was harvested in the fall in
   the dent stage to measure the total above-ground biomass N uptake. Soil
   profiles (1.8 m) were sampled annually in the fall after crop harvest to
   determine NO3-N in the soil or carryover.
   Great variability was encountered in measuring the amount of extractor
   water and its NO3 content under each water regime, which made estimates
   of NO3 leaching losses unreliable. Also, the variability demonstrates
   formidable problems in quantifying percolation losses with vacuum trough
   extractors under undisturbed fine-textured soil profiles. With the
   highest N rate of 376 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) and within the water regime W-1,
   where leaching was expected to be greatest, only 1\% of the cumulative
   labeled N applied was found in extractor waters and most movement of the
   labeled N into extractors occurred the third year. The
   125-kg-ha(-1)-yr(-1) fertilizer N rate significantly increased the crop
   yield over the unfertilized plots without increasing residual NO3-N
   accumulation; whereas fertilizer N rates of > 125 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) did
   not appreciably increase plant yields over the 125-kg-ha(-1)-N rate, but
   did appreciably increase residual NO3.}},

Abstract = {{Cropping systems that fail to integrate nitrogen (N) water management
   are frequently associated with elevated concentrations of nitrate-N in
   soil and groundwater. Examples of poorly integrated management practices
   are abundant, especially where irrigation is used to minimize the
   effects of drought and N fertilizer is inexpensive. Two maize fields
   under improved water and N management practices at the Nebraska
   Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) project were compared with an
   adjacent field under conventional furrow irrigation that followed
   management guidelines mandated by the local Natural Resources District.
   Surge-flow furrow irrigation with laser grading and a runoff-water
   recovery system reduced water application by 45-69\% compared to
   conventional furrow irrigation over the three years of this study.
   Center-pivot sprinkler irrigation reduced water application by 60-72\%
   compared to conventional furrow irrigation. Uniformity of water
   application was improved with the surge-flow and sprinkler irrigation
   systems, which made it reasonable to consider adding fertilizer N in the
   water (fertigation) to meet crop needs. The spoon-feeding strategy,
   based on chlorophyll meter readings to schedule fertigation, saved 168
   kg ha(-1) N the first year and 105 kg ha(-1) N the second year without
   reducing yields. Near total reliance of fertigation to meet crop N needs
   resulted in a 15\% yield reduction the second year because spatial
   variability in soil N status made it difficult to collect representative
   chlorophyll meter data. Plot studies showed chlorophyll meter readings
   and yields were consistently higher for maize following soybean than
   where maize was grown in monoculture.}},

Abstract = {{The Nitrate Leaching and Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP) model was
   used to evaluate effects of climate and N fertility on nitrate leaching
   from a 3-yr field experiment of continuous corn (Zea mays L.). Half of
   the plots were randomly chosen to be either nonirrigated or irrigated
   (based upon calculated potential evapotranspiration). Three replications
   of nitrogen (N) fertility (56, 112 and 224 kg ha(-1)) were used. Soil
   was a Hecla sandy loam to loamy sand (Pachic Udic Haploboroll). Soil and
   climate data were from the upper Midwest U.S.A. database for NLEAP.
   On-site data were used in the model when available.
   This study shows that NLEAP is capable of integrating data collected for
   nonirrigated and irrigated conditions on sandy soil for a wide range of
   N treatments and predicting the nitrate available for leaching (NAL).
   Precipitation distribution and amount were different in each year.
   Calculated NAL provided an excellent indicator of potential nitrate
   leaching hazard. NLEAP output showed that leaching of residual N on this
   sandy soil is very sensitive to early-spring precipitation. The NLEAP
   model provided valuable insights concerning effects of climate and N and
   irrigation management on N leaching. To obtain optimum yields while
   minimizing nitrate leaching, this study indicates the need to use soil
   and plant-tissue testing, post-emergence N-fertilizer application, and
   modem irrigation-scheduling technology. Also, use of the NLEAP model
   along with field-plot experiments provide additional important
   information concerning timing of N-leaching events relative to climate
   and an additional assessment of the effectiveness of fertilizer-N
   management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Leaching of NO3-N from agricultural lands often occurs in well-defined
   hot spot areas when viewed across geographical regions of hundreds or
   thousands of km(2) and often appears as areas of high NO3-N
   concentrations in shallow underlying aquifers. Delineation of high-NO3-N
   zones can be achieved by combining models such the Nitrate Leaching and
   Economic Analysis Package (NLEAP) with Geographical Information System
   (GIS) technology to calculate the long-term potential mass of NO3-N
   leached from the crop root zone. Once identified, the hot spots can be
   further analyzed with the model to evaluate and rank appropriate
   alternative management techniques. A simulation analysis using the NLEAP
   model showed that long-term NO3-N leaching from corn (Zea mays L.) grown
   under furrow irrigation on a coarse-textured soil could be reduced by
   53\% with N management alone, while an 84\% reduction in leached NO3-N
   was achieved for combined N and water management (sprinkler irrigation).
   This type of modeling analysis can be completed after a few weeks of
   effort, while comparable field studies would take several years to
   finish.}},

Abstract = {{With respect to groundwater quality objectives, it is difficult to
   understand the nitrogen balance and nitrogen dynamics of agricultural
   ecosystems without the support of deterministic and stochastic
   simulation tools. This paper focuses on the deterministic and stochastic
   modelling of water, heat and nitrogen dynamics in the soil compartments
   of agricultural ecosystems. The deterministic nitrogen simulation model
   for agricultural soils presented in this paper, WHNSIM, was originally
   designed for site conditions typical of southern Germany but can easily
   be applied to other regions due to its physically based design. Model
   results are compared with data originating from different experimental
   sites in Germany. Special consideration is given to the effects of
   spatial variability. Two different techniques of Monte Carlo simulation
   are used to study the impact of parameter variability on target
   variables of nitrogen dynamics on the field scale. Moreover, a procedure
   is presented that allows modelling nitrogen dynamics on the scale of

Abstract = {{Farming practices are often developed to tackle one aspect of a problem
   without due regard to other possible consequences. Nutrient management
   systems commonly concentrate on maximizing yields rather than attempting
   to balance the needs of the crop with the desire to minimize
   contamination of the environment. Particular problems are shown to be
   associated with utilization of animal manures on arable crops, and the
   move towards soil conservation practices, especially the use of cover
   crops. We suggest that nutrient budgets provide a suitable format for
   developing a systems approach. We consider the issues associated with
   managing nitrogen for whole farm systems, taking account of the need for
   efficient production and protection of the environment from losses by
   leaching and in gaseous form. Finally, we suggest a role for expert
   groups in developing a systems approach.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate leaching can be reduced by the adoption of less intensive
   grassland systems which, though requiring a greater land area to achieve
   the same agricultural output, result in less nitrate leaching per unit
   of production than do intensively managed grasslands. The economic
   penalties associated with reductions in output can be partly offset by
   greater reliance on symbiotic nitrogen fixation and the use of
   clover-based swards in place of synthetic N fertilisers. Alternatively,
   specific measures can be adopted to improve the efficiency of nitrogen
   use in intensively managed systems in order to maintain high outputs but
   with reduced losses. Controls should take account of other forms of loss
   and flows of nitrogen between grassland and other components of the
   whole-farm system and, in most instances, should result in an overall
   reduction in nitrogen inputs. Removing stock from the fields earlier in
   the grazing season will reduce the accumulation of high concentrations
   of potentially leachable nitrate in the soil of grazed pastures but will
   increase the quantity of manure produced by housed animals and the need
   to recycle this effectively. Supplementing grass diets with low-nitrogen
   forages such as maize silage will reduce the quantity of nitrogen
   excreted by livestock but may increase the potential for nitrate
   leaching elsewhere on the farm if changes to cropping patterns involve
   more frequent cultivation of grassland. Improved utilisation by the
   sward of nitrogen in animal excreta and manures and released by
   mineralisation of soil organic matter will permit equivalent reductions
   to be made in fertiliser inputs, provided that adequate information is
   available about the supply of nitrogen from these non-fertiliser
   sources.}},

Abstract = {{Winter leaching losses of nitrate following the ploughing of temporary
   leguminous pastures in late summer or early autumn are a major concern
   in mixed cropping rotations on the Canterbury Plains of New Zealand.
   Field experiments showed that pastures ploughed in early autumn (March)
   and left fallow accumulated 107-142 kg ha(-1) N of mineral-N in the soil
   profile by the start of winter, with 72-106 kg ha(-1) N lost through
   leaching in the first winter. Delaying the ploughing of pasture until
   late autumn (May) reduced the accumulation of mineral-N to 42-120 kg
   ha(-1) N and the leaching loss to 8-52 kg ha(-1) N.
   In situations where early cultivation cannot be avoided, growing winter
   cover crops or using the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD)
   both have the potential to reduce leaching compared with fallow soil.
   DCD increased the amount of mineral-N present in the soil as ammonium
   and reduced leaching losses by 25-50\% without affecting the yield of
   the following spring wheat crop.
   Cover crops only reduced leaching losses (by up to 60\%) when they were
   sown early in the autumn and they had taken up considerable amounts of
   soil mineral-N before drainage occurred. When cover crops were grazed
   before incorporation in spring, there was an increased risk of leaching
   from urine patch areas. If residues were incorporated without grazing,
   however, the yield of the following spring wheat crop was depressed by
   20-30\% due to extensive net N immobilization during decomposition of
   the residues.
   In Canterbury conditions, the most reliable way to minimise N leaching
   losses is to delay the ploughing of pasture for as long as possible in
   autumn or winter. Where pastures are ploughed early, the relative
   effectiveness of using DCD or growing winter cover crops varies mainly
   in relation to rainfall distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Urine-affected areas can lead to considerable losses of N by leaching,
   ammonia volatilisation and denitrification from dairy pastures in the
   southeast of South Australia. Potable groundwater supplies are
   considered to have become contaminated by nitrate as a result of
   leaching from these leguminous pastures. Dairy cow urine, labelled with
   N-15 urea, was applied to micro-plots and mini-lysimeters installed in
   two adjacent irrigated (white clover-rye grass) and non-irrigated
   (subterranean clover-annual grasses) paddocks of a dairy farm on four
   occasions representing different seasonal conditions. These experiments
   allowed measurement of nitrogen transformations, recovery of N-15 in the
   pasture and soil, and leaching below various depths. Gaseous losses were
   calculated from the nitrogen balance.
   The results of the four experiments showed that within a day of urine
   application up to 40\% of the applied urinary-N was leached below a
   depth of 150 mm as a result of macropore flow in the irrigated paddock,
   and up to 24\% in the non-irrigated one. After application to the
   irrigated paddock 17\% of the urinary-N moved immediately below 300 mm
   but only 2\% below the 450-mm depth.
   The urinary-N remaining in the soil was converted from urea to ammonium
   within a day regardless of season. Within the first 7 days of
   application six times more nitrate was produced in summer than in
   winter. This has obvious implications for leaching potential.
   Leaching of N-15 from the top 150 mm of soil, following urine
   applications in all seasons, was between 41\% and 62\% of the applied
   N-15 in the irrigated paddock and 25-51\% in the non-irrigated paddock.
   However, leaching losses measured at depths of 300 or 450 mm were
   smaller by a factor of 2-4. The leaching loss of N-15 applied in spring
   in both paddocks was 41\% below 150 mm and 12\% below 450 mm. Recovery
   of N-15 from the soil-plant system in the 450-mm-deep lysimeters was
   similar to 60\% of that applied.
   Estimated ammonia volatilisation was similar to 9\% of applied N-15 With
   no paddock or season effect. No denitrification was evident in summer
   nor in the non-irrigated paddock in winter but 12\% of the applied N-15
   was lost due to denitrification following winter application to the
   irrigated paddock. Estimated N-15 loss due to denitrification from urine
   applied in spring was similar to 13\% of that applied and no difference
   was found between paddocks. The combination of mini-lysimeters,
   micro-plots and N-15 measurements enabled the nitrogen budget to be
   determined during four periods throughout the year.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation of specific organic compounds was investigated by in
   situ and laboratory experiments in an anaerobic landfill leachate
   pollution plume at four different distances from the landfill. This
   paper presents the experimental conditions in the in situ microcosm and
   laboratory batch microcosm experiments performed and the results on the
   fate of 7 phenolic compounds. Part 2 of this series of papers, also
   published in this issue, presents the results on the fate of 8 aromatic
   compounds and 4 chlorinated aliphatic compounds.
   The redox conditions in the plume were characterized as methanogenic,
   Fe(III)-reducing and NO3--reducing by the redox sensitive species
   present in groundwater and sediment and by bioassays. With a few
   exceptions the aquifer redox conditions were maintained throughout the
   experiments as monitored by redox sensitive species present in
   groundwater during the experiments, by redox sensitive species present
   in the sediment after the experiments and by bioassays performed after
   the experiments.
   Transformation of nitrophenol was very fast close to the landfill in
   strongly reducing conditions, while transformation was slower in the
   more oxidized part of the plume. Lag phases for the nitrophenols were
   short (maximum 10 days). Phenol was only transformed in the more distant
   part of the plume in experiments where NO3-, Fe(III) and Mn(IV)
   reduction was dominant. Lag phases for phenol were either absent or
   lasted up to 2 months. Dichlorophenols were only transformed in
   experiments representing strongly reducing, presumably methanogenic,
   redox conditions close to the landfill after lag phases of up to 3
   months. Transformation of o-cresol was not observed in any of the
   experiments throughout the plume.
   Generally, there was good accordance between the results obtained by in
   situ and laboratory experiments, both concerning redox conditions and
   the fate of the phenolic compounds. However, for phenol and
   2,4-dichlorophenol, transformation was observed in same in situ
   experiments but not in the corresponding laboratory experiments. In some
   experiments, this could be explained by differences in the redox
   conditions developing during the experiments. Nitrophenols were
   apparently transformed abiotically in the most reduced part of the
   plume, at 2 m from the landfill.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation of specific organic compounds was investigated by in
   situ and laboratory experiments in an anaerobic landfill leachate
   pollution plume at four different distances from the landfill. In a
   previous paper (Part 1, also published in this issue) we described the
   in situ microcosm and laboratory batch microcosm experiments performed
   focusing on redox conditions, microbiology and the fate of 7 phenolic
   compounds. In this paper we present the results on the fate of 8
   aromatic compounds and 4 chlorinated aliphatic compounds.
   Nitrobenzene was transformed at all distances from the landfill in
   methanogenic, and Fe(III)-and NO3--reducing conditions. Toluene was
   transformed slowly in one out of three in situ experiments at the
   distance of 250 m from the landfill in the Fe(III)-reducing part of the
   plume after a lag phase of similar to 3 months. Benzene, o-xylene,
   p-dichlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, naphthalene and biphenyl were not
   transformed at any of the investigated distances from the landfill,
   neither in in situ nor in laboratory experiments. In the methanogenic
   part of the aquifer 2 m from the landfill, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
   tetrachloromethane and tetrachloroethene were transformed in in situ
   experiments while trichloroethene was not. Lag phase periods were up to
   40 days for 1,1,1-trichloroethane and up to 100 days for
   tetrachloroethene. No or only short lag phases (<10 days) were observed
   for tetrachloromethane. Tetrachloromethane was furthermore transformed
   at distances of up to 250 m from the landfill in Fe(III)-reducing
   conditions but not in NO3--reducing conditions at 350 m from the
   landfill. Abiotic processes apparently contributed to the transformation
   of tetrachloromethane. A local variation in the transformation of the
   chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons was observed at 2 m from the
   landfill. In general, good accordance with respect to compound
   transformation was observed between in situ and laboratory experiments,
   but in a few cases more compounds were transformed in in situ
   experiments than in the corresponding laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In a 2.5-yr field study we determined the distribution of atrazine and
   its metabolites in a sandy-till aquifer overlying Cambrian sandstone in
   a dairy farming area. Flow paths are predominantly downward at
   piezometer nests where vertical hydraulic gradients dominate. Atrazine
   and desethylated atrazine concentrations along those flow paths
   generally decrease with increasing estimated groundwater travel time to
   the monitoring points. A one-dimensional contaminant transport model is
   developed in FORTRAN incorporating major chemical processes and
   dispersion along simulated flow paths. Separate simulations of atrazine
   and desethylated atrazine transport to individual piezometers are made,
   each with an appropriate average groundwater velocity. Regression
   equations are developed, based on an extensive literature review, to
   estimate acceptable sorption and dispersivity coefficients for the
   transport model. The one-dimensional simulations are calibrated using
   the field concentration-travel time relationships for atrazine and
   desethylated atrazine. The calibration procedure provides estimates of
   atrazine and desethylated atrazine degradation rates in groundwater
   corresponding to half-lives of 3470 and 2770 days, respectively.
   Although uncertain, the estimates provide evidence of much slower
   degradation in the aquifer than indicated by laboratory experiments.
   Using the calibrated transport parameter values, simulations of
   long-term steady-state leaching to the water table demonstrate that even
   with such slow degradation rates, steady-state concentrations at most
   piezometers are reached within similar to 20 yr. Concentrations in the
   underlying sandstone aquifer are therefore not expected to increase
   substantially over time due to continued atrazine use. However, the slow
   degradation rates mean that even with the most optimistic condition,
   i.e. all input to the aquifer ceases in response to a cessation of
   atrazine application, it may take more than a decade for concentrations
   deeper in the aquifer to drop to half of what they were during the
   period of atrazine use.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of the relation between capillary pressure (P-c) and fluid
   saturation (S) for porous media containing oil-water or air-oil-water,
   often assume that the medium is strongly water-wet. Natural porous
   media, however, are composed of a variety of mineral constituents; such
   media are typically composed of water- and oil-wet fractions. This study
   reports on two- and three-fluid P-c-S data for media of different
   fractions of water- and oil-wet sands. The oil-water capillary pressure,
   defined as the oil minus the water pressure, was measured during
   drainage (primary and main curves) as well as imbibition (main curve
   only) of water. A decrease in oil-water pressure was observed as the
   oil-wet fraction increased in two-fluid media. The pressure became
   negative during imbibition of water for relatively oil-wet media. The
   P-c-S data could be adequately described by modifying the van Genuchten
   model for water retention. The observed differences between primary and
   main drainage curves were partly attributed to the effect of initial
   saturation. In three-fluid systems with fractional wettability, the
   observed dependency of capillary pressures on fluid saturations
   suggested that there was no continuous intermediate phase -even for a
   relatively low oil-wet fraction (25\%). The oil-water and air-water
   capillary pressures decreased, at a particular water saturation, as the
   fraction of oil-wet sand increased. The water pressure is greater when
   water acts as the intermediate fluid than when it is the wetting fluid.
   The oil pressure, and hence the air-oil capillary pressure, was
   relatively insensitive to whether oil acted as wetting or intermediate
   fluid. There is a need to model three-fluid P-c-S curves that account
   for different wetting and intermediate fluids.}},

Abstract = {{Field and laboratory work have shown that the availability of electron
   accepters such as oxygen and/or nitrogen as well as of nutrients such as
   nitrogen and phosphorus is necessary for effective biodegradation of
   hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, these compounds are frequently
   injected into the contaminated subsurface to enhance in situ
   biodegradation. The effect of residual subsurface hydrocarbon (kerosene)
   contamination on the transport of an electron acceptor (NO3-) and a
   nutrient (NH4+) was investigated. Soil column experiments were conducted
   using uncontaminated and contaminated soil, and a one-dimensional solute
   transport model with multiprocess nonequilibrium sorption was used to
   predict the breakthrough curves. The presence of kerosene contamination
   was found to decrease the volumetric water content which in turn
   increased the pore-water velocity. An earlier breakthrough time for NO3-
   relative to the uncontaminated soil was observed and predicted by the
   transport model. The exchange isotherm involving NH4+ was not affected
   by the presence of kerosene; therefore, no significant difference in
   NH4+ transport was observed or predicted. The results of this study
   indicate that the transport of NO3- will be increased by residual
   subsurface hydrocarbon contamination whereas NH4+ transport will be
   unaffected. Therefore the presence of residual subsurface contamination
   by hydrocarbons will have to be taken into account in NO3- transport
   models.}},

Abstract = {{A highly-weathered, sandy aquifer material from the Upper Coastal Plain
   region of the southeastern U.S.A. (Aiken, South Carolina) was used to
   determine the impact of ionic strength and solution composition on the
   determination of physical transport parameters using ionic tracers. The
   mineralogy of the clay fraction consisted primarily of kaolinite,
   goethite and mica. Repacked saturated columns (bulk density similar to
   1.5 g cm(-3)) were leached at a constant rate (similar to 0.25 cm
   min(-1)) with a given tracer solution. For comparison, tritium (similar
   to 200 pCi mL(-1)) was included in leachate of selected columns and
   several of the experiments were replicated in columns of acid-washed
   sand. Pore volume estimates based on tritium breakthrough were
   consistent with those calculated from the bulk density of the repacked
   matrix. In contrast, solute breakthrough for the sandy geologic material
   was dependent on concentration, as well as cation and anion type. At low
   ionic strengths (0.0005-0.010 M) that are analogous to conditions that
   may be encountered in field-scale transport experiments, neither the
   cation nor the anion acted conservatively, yielding systematically high
   estimates of column porosity or low estimates of flow velocity. At the
   higher ionic strengths (similar to 0.10 M), solute breakthrough was
   essentially conservative regardless of ionic composition. The impact of
   cation valence and concentration on Br- breakthrough was determined
   using MgBr2 and KBr solutions of varying concentrations (0.001-0.1 N).
   Bromide breakthrough was substantially delayed for concentrations below
   0.10 M and was delayed to a greater extent in the presence of a divalent
   cation (Mg2+) than in the presence of a monovalent cation (K+). Failure
   to recognize these interactions in the field could lead to a false
   interpretation of Br displacement in terms of physical interactions,
   i.e. flow velocity, dispersivity, etc.}},

   important for estimating contaminant transport in soils and design of
   remediation processes for contaminated soils and groundwater.
   Liquid-phase diffusion through unsaturated soils is governed by both the
   pore size distribution and water distribution of the soil matrix.
   Diffusion tube experiments were carried out using several soils packed
   to field densities to determine the effective diffusivity of chloride
   ion as a function of soil moisture content. Chloride was selected to
   serve as a non-volatile, non-sorbing tracer species. A transport model
   was developed to predict liquid-phase tortuosity as a function of
   readily obtained soil parameters, including density, moisture content,
   particle size distribution and pore size distribution. The basis of the
   model was parallel diffusion resistances in the inter- and
   intra-particle pore regimes. The new model was found to provide an
   accurate prediction of observed experimental results. Previously
   reported models did not agree with experimental results over significant
   portions of the experimental domain investigated.}},

   that find their way into the subsurface are frequently chemically
   complex. The dispersion and diffusion characteristics of multicomponent
   solutions in soil have rarely been compared to equivalent single-solute

   dispersive transport of single- and multi-component solutions in
   homogeneous porous media. The miscible displacement technique was used
   to investigate the transport behavior of C-14-labelled
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyadetic acid (2,4-D) in two materials for which
   sorption of 2,4-D was minimal. Comparison of breakthrough curves
   collected for 2,4-D in single- and multi-component solutions shows that
   there is little, if. any, difference in transport behavior over a wide
   range of pore-water velocities (70, 7, 0.66 and 0.06 cm h(-1)). Thus,
   dispersivities measured with a non-sorbing single-solute solution should

   a glass chamber (50 cm X 60 cm X 0.95 cm) using four Miller-similar
   silica sands (12/20, 20/30, 30/40 and 40/50 sieve sizes) and two LNAPL's
   (Soltrol(R) 220 and Duoprime(R) 55 mineral oil). LNAPL's were released
   in water-wetted sands to simulate a point-source discharge above a water
   table. Observation of light transmission was used to delineate the
   changing LNAPL lens boundary during infiltration until equilibrium was
   established. At equilibrium, no zone above the capillary fringe remained
   at a NAPL saturation higher than the residual saturation. A previously
   published model for predicting vertical lens dimensions was tested and
   good agreement was found between measured and predicted lens thicknesses
   when the time-dependent nature of LNAPL-water interfacial tensions was
   considered. Less agreement between measured and predicted lens
   thicknesses was found when model equations were modified to a fully
   explicit, predictive form. Observed spatial variability in the
   emplacement of LNAPL's in the capillary fringe, compounded by the strong
   time dependence of a key variable, limits the use of the model as a
   predictive tool, but provides important insight into the low precision
   in prediction which is attainable even if a more complete model was
   developed. The results provide a means to better understand LNAPL
   behavior in the subsurface environment.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of PO43- behaviour in a well-defined septic system
   plume on calcareous sand (Cambridge site) shows that, after 17 yr of
   system operation, a distinct PO43- plume (PO43--P > 1 mg L(-1)) is
   present extending 20 m downgradient from the infiltration bed. The PO43-
   plume migration velocity is similar to 1 m yr(-1), reflecting
   retardation by a factor of 20 compared to the groundwater velocity.
   During monitoring between years 10 to 17, an expanding steady-state zone
   was noted below the infiltration bed where PO43--P levels remained
   consistently near 4 mg L(-1), a value similar to 25\% lower than the
   average effluent value (6.3 mg L(-1)). The pattern of attenuation - a
   25\% mass loss in the 2-m-thick vadose zone, then little further
   attenuation along the flowpath - is suggestive of a condition of
   equilibrium with a controlling phosphate mineral phase. Chemical
   equilibrium modelling shows supersaturation with respect to
   hydroxylapatite and variscite. Four other field sites are identified
   from the literature and from our work where similar steady-state PO43-
   zones are present in septic system plumes. In these, steady-state levels
   range from 15\% to 68\% of effluent values, with lower concentrations
   observed in the more acidic plumes, again indicative of a mineral
   solubility control, possibly variscite.
   PO43- behaviour in these plumes suggests that, although P migration
   velocity is controlled by the processes of sorption, the magnitude of
   P-4(3-) that is present is governed by the constraints of phosphate
   mineral solubility. When septic systems on sands are located relatively
   close to sensitive surface water bodies and when long-term downgradient
   impact is the primary concern, more attention should be focused an the
   geochemical conditions that control PO43- mineral solubility rather than
   only on the sorption characteristics of the sediment.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a simple method based on the examination of
   ultraviolet multiwavelength absorptiometry of groundwater samples
   collected from a karstic aquifer, for direct and fast quality
   evaluation. The method provides information about the flow conditions of
   a karstic system, it helps with the monitoring of groundwater sampling
   during the pumping procedure and, finally, it gives an insight into the
   complexity of the spatial and temporal evolutions of the system.
   Application of this method to the study of a karstic experimental field
   situated in the south of France is subsequently presented. UV
   spectrophotometry used during investigations shows the hydraulic
   relation between two piezometers, and also between a piezometer and a
   surface watercourse. It stresses the influence of surface hydrology on
   water quality of this karstic aquifer. During periods of high now, the
   water quality is the same in all the piezometers and is linked to the
   leaching of nitrates present in the upper surrounds of the aquifer;
   during mean or low flow, each piezometer presents a particular water
   quality depending on its local transmissivity.}},

Abstract = {{To be useful to field practitioners, advances in bioremediation research
   must be capable of being scaled up from the laboratory to the field. The
   phenomena which control the rate at which biodegradation proceeds are
   typically scale-dependent in nature. Failure to understand and account
   for scale-dependent variables, such as mass transport limitations,
   spatial heterogeneities and the presence of competing microorganisms,
   may inhibit the effectiveness of field-scale bioremediation designs.
   This paper reviews and evaluates the methods available for
   characterization of the processes effecting bioremediation at scales
   ranging from the laboratory to the field. Questions facing the
   field-scale practitioner of bioremediation are addressed in a manner
   which highlights the current state of research, the reliability of
   results and the extent to which laboratory-scale research accurately
   reflects common field conditions. Where gaps or inadequacies exist in
   our current knowledge or methods, research needs are identified. This
   review is intended to complement existing work by providing a framework
   from which to assess the importance of scale of observation to a
   particular result or conclusion, thereby providing an integrated
   approach to the scale-up process.}},

Abstract = {{Xylene, originating from a spill, is present both as a nonaqueous-phase
   liquid (NAPL) at residual saturation near the water table, and as a
   dissolved groundwater component contaminating a sandy aquifer beneath an
   abandoned refinery. Three remediation wells are in operation on the site
   to prevent further xylene migration in the groundwater. Field
   observations indicate that microbially-mediated xylene degradation and
   oxygen and nitrate reduction occur in the aquifer. To realistically
   simulate dissolved xylene migration at this site, a three-dimensional
   numerical flow and transport model incorporating biochemical
   multispecies interactions and xylene dissolution from the NAPL has been
   developed. In the calibration process the variable contact area between
   the NAPL and groundwater and the vertical transverse dispersivity were
   identified as crucial parameters controlling the fate of xylene. The
   simultaneous modeling of a whole set of related reactive species made it
   also possible to quantify the observed biodegradation. Results indicate
   that it contributes in the same order of magnitude to total xylene
   removal than does extraction by the wells. The calibrated model will be
   used to assist in the design of an in situ bioremediation scheme, where
   biodegradation in the aquifer is enhanced by injection of an electron
   acceptor.}},

Abstract = {{A large (1.1 m X 0.8 m in diameter) core of strongly cracked clay soil
   was instrumented with eight suction samplers, ten zero-suction samplers
   and sixteen pressure transducer tensiometers. Results of three rainfall
   events labelled with potassium bromide, pentafluorobenzoic acid and
   2,6-difluorobenzoic acid indicate rapid bypass flow, matrix advection
   and mixing of water between the soil macropores and the matrix all
   occurred. Generally, no sharp distinction was observed between crack
   flow and matrix advection; water flow was best described by a continuum
   of flow phenomena. Before rainfall application, the herbicides atrazine
   and isoproturon were applied to the soil surface at rates typically used
   in the field (2.475 kg active ingredient/ha). Rapid bypass flow in large
   cracks, by which some of the solutes were transported with limited
   contact with the soil, was mainly responsible for redistribution of the
   herbicides and their movement to depth in short time periods. Over the
   course of the experiments 0.23 pore volumes of rainfall were applied to
   the core but only 0.02 pore volumes were recovered by gravity drainage.
   Less than 1\% of the herbicides applied was lost in water draining from
   the soil core.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to measure the change in the
   ultrasonic wave signature as a function of the fraction of
   nonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants in initially water-saturated
   sand samples. This represents a fundamental step in the application of
   high-frequency seismic measurements to detect and delineate NAPL
   contamination in groundwater. The NAPL's used are n-dodecane, iso-octane
   and Freon 113(R). P-wave velocity changes almost linearly as a function
   of the fraction of pore space occupied by NAPL. At a given NAPL
   fraction, the velocities rank with the bulk moduli of the NAPL's. The
   percent change in velocity at residual water saturation relative to the
   water-saturated medium ranges from 15\% for n-dodecane to 31\% for Freon
   113(R). Velocity changes are significant relative to the ability of
   seismic methods to detect changes on the order of 5\%. These data are
   described by a model previously derived by G.T. Kuster and M.N. Toksaz
   of P-wave transmission through a fluid matrix with spherical inclusions
   that is modified to account for a two-fluid-phase matrix. Amplitude data
   as a function of NAPL fraction are described by assuming the
   distribution of NAPL in the column and using attenuation coefficients
   for the water-saturated and residual-water medium. Amplitudes are shown
   to be sensitive to both the fraction of NAPL and its distribution,
   whereas velocity is only a function of NAPL fraction.}},

Abstract = {{The wettability of a porous medium plays a critical role in the
   capillary phenomena governing the migration of a nonaqueous-phase liquid
   (NAPL) and subsequent efforts to recover this type of pollutant source
   from the subsurface. Although it is usually assumed that water-wetting
   conditions occur, limited field evidence at NAPL sites suggests that
   wettability characteristics can change to intermediate or organic-phase
   wetting, especially for complex NAPL's containing polar or surfactant
   molecules. The focus of this work was an assessment of potential
   wettability conditions for quartz mineral surfaces after exposure to
   synthetic gasolines. Many of the chemicals added to gasoline to increase
   engine performance have polar or surfactant characteristics. It is
   hypothesized that these additives could sorb to the quartz, causing the
   surface to become less hydrophilic. Four gasoline additives were added
   to isooctane, the base chemical for the synthetic gasoline. Following
   the exposure of the mineral surfaces to the organic phases, wettability
   was measured by three different techniques: oil-water contact angles,
   air-water imbibition rates and oil-water capillary pressure curves
   coupled with calculation of the USBM wettability index. Results show a
   change to intermediate-wetting conditions for two of the additives
   considered. Both concentration and the molecular structure of the
   additives affect the extent of these alterations.}},

Abstract = {{Two small farmland plots were treated with atrazine and alachlor at a
   rate of 1.4 and 1.6 kg ha(-1), respectively. Subsurface drains were
   placed in each plot to allow sampling of the leachate from February 14
   to May 26, 1989. The early leaching phase was high for both herbicides.
   Simulations were also made with a deterministic, physically-based model
   (HYDRUS). Different approaches were used to estimate the values of both
   sorption (K-d) and degradation (mu) parameters, namely, conventional
   soil-transfer functions, best-fitting to measured field data, and
   mass-balance and time-step procedures. The K-d-values obtained by the
   best-fitting method were the lowest, those calculated by conventional
   pedotransfer functions the highest. Measured and simulated leaching data
   were then compared. Qualitative (graphics) and quantitative (statistics)
   evaluations indicated that the herbicide leaching predictions depended
   greatly on the sorption parameter input. Computer simulations using
   K-d-values derived from the best-fitting and time-step approaches gave
   the best results in predicting the herbicide leaching under field soil
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The biological in situ remediation of a former pesticide production
   site, highly contaminated with chlorobenzenes, chlorophenols and
   hexachlorocyclohexanes, was studied for a period of one year. Field
   experiments testing the remediation technology were carried out in the
   subsurface to a depth of 5.5 m. Detailed monitoring of several chemical
   and microbiological parameters was made in order to evaluate the
   remediation success. The initial pollution of this site ranged from
   0.03-0.30 g EOX (extractable halogenated organic compounds)/kg soil in
   the saturated layer to 1-20 g kg(-1) EOX in the unsaturated layer,
   whereas the impounded water was polluted with 8-13 mg L(-1) AOX
   (adsorbable halogenated organic compounds). No significant decrease of
   the pollutants in the subsoil was observed, although oxygen and
   nutrients were supplied in sufficient concentrations. In contrast,
   several of the chlorinated organic compounds were eliminated from the
   water treatment plant, either by physical or biological processes. Based
   on measurements of AOX in different parts of the plant, 26\% of the
   pollutants was found adsorbed on the activated carbon and 3\% was found
   in the sludge of the filter back-wash. Dependent on these measurements,
   elimination of similar to 70\% of the pollutants was attributed to
   microbial degradation. The latter fact is supported by oxygen
   consumption data, by increase in the microbial counts and by changes in
   the distribution of the pollutants in the plant effluent. Among the
   chlorobenzenes, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, and among the
   hexachlorocyclohexanes, alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane were eliminated
   preferentially. The results suggest that an in situ remediation of a
   site polluted with chlorinated organic compounds cannot be recommended;
   however, an on site circulation water treatment is possible by a
   combination of physical and biological processes.}},

Abstract = {{Injection of air into the saturated zone of a contaminated aquifer, air
   sparging, is a currently popular remediation alternative to the
   conventional approach of groundwater extraction followed by surface
   treatment. The air flow behavior around a single air sparging well was
   investigated under natural field conditions in a relatively homogeneous
   aquifer consisting of well-sorted dune sand. The response of
   conventional monitoring data (including water table mounding, son gas
   pressure, soil gas composition and tracer gas response) was compared
   with the results of cross-borehole electrical resistance tomography
   (ERT), which provides a sensitive indication of the pattern of air flow
   in the saturated zone. Compared with the region of air flow imaged by
   ERT, conventional monitoring data provided an ambiguous indication of
   the region of air flow in the saturated zone, possibly leading to an
   overestimation of,the radius of influence by a factor of two to eight.
   Critical evaluation of the conventional monitoring data indicates that
   the shortcomings are a function of various factors which include the
   transient aspects of pressure and water table changes, and differences
   in the controls on air flow within the saturated and unsaturated zones.}},

Abstract = {{Neutron radiography (NR) provides a sensitive and quantitative technique
   for the determination of hydrogen. NR can therefore be used to determine
   the porosity of rocks impregnated with a hydrogen-containing material:
   in this feasibility study, the water content of granodiorite and
   mylonite samples was determined by quantitative NR combined with
   densitometric scanning. For a sample of 1-cm thickness, this technique
   allows porosity detection down to 0.015 with a resolution of 1 mm(2),
   down to 0.005 with a resolution of 2 cm(2), and is applicable for
   porosities higher than 0.05 with a precision of +/- 0.5\% at a
   resolution of 1 cm(2). 3-D information may be gained by combination of
   2-D radiographs. The accuracy of the technique was estimated by
   comparing the NR results with those obtained by gravimetry. Extension to
   resin-impregnated porosity and to other types or rock is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted to evaluate whether vapor-density effects
   are significant in transporting volatile organic compounds (VOC's) with
   high vapor pressure and molecular mass through the subsurface.
   Trichloroethylene (TCE) was chosen far the investigation because it is a
   common VOC contaminant with high vapor pressure and molecular mass. For
   the investigation, a 2-m-long by 1-m-high by 7.5-cm-thick flow cell was
   constructed with a network of sampling ports. The flow cell was packed
   with sand, and a water table was established near the lower boundary.
   Liquid TCE was placed near the upper boundary of the flow cell in a
   chamber from which vapors could enter and migrate through the sand. TCE
   concentrations in the gas phase were measured by extracting 25-mu l gas
   samples with an air-tight syringe and analyzing them with a gas
   chromatograph. The evolution of the TCE gas plume in the sand was
   investigated by examining plots of TCE concentrations over the domain
   for specific times and for particular locations as a function of time.
   To help in this analysis, a numerical model was developed that can
   predict the simultaneous movements of a gas, a nonaqueous liquid and
   water in porous media. The model also considers interphase mass transfer
   by employing the phase equilibrium assumption. The model was tested with
   one- and two-dimensional analytical solutions of fluid flow before it
   was used to simulate the experiment. Comparisons between experimental
   data and simulation results when vapor-density effects are considered
   were very good. When vapor-density effects were ignored, agreement was
   poor. These analyses suggest that vapor-density effects should be
   considered and that density-driven vapor advection may be an important
   mechanism for moving VOC's with high vapor pressures and molecular mass
   through the subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{A 3.6-m-thick unsaturated zone was constructed in a mesoscale model
   (2.4-m diameter by 4.6 m high, 65 tomes) consisting of A, B and C
   profiles. The model was designed to be a homogeneous isotropic system.
   Assuming piston flow the estimated transit time for water through the
   unsaturated zone (3.3 m) under steady-state conditions was 25-30 days.
   Monitoring of major ions, metals, pH, alkalinity, CO2, N-2, O-2, CH4 and
   other parameters indicated that the system approached chemical steady
   state after similar to 130-150 days. The herbicide diclofop-methyl was
   applied to ground surface on day 78. The migration of the herbicide was
   monitored at intervals using suction lysimeters to collect pore-water
   samples. Diclofop was detected in the 0.08-, 0.22-, 0.36- and
   0.54-m-depth samplers. However, the timing of detection, at 0.08 m
   immediately after application, 0.54 m after 4 days, and 0.22 and 0.36 m
   after 12 days indicated the presence of preferential now paths. Studies
   of the surface CO2 flux and water chemistry at 0.85 m further supported
   the existence of preferential flow. A fluorescein treatment was applied
   (day 345) to the surface and the model was systematically sampled and
   excavated (day 348), under ultra violet illumination, to further examine
   flow patterns and paths. Mapping of the distribution of fluorescein and
   examination of vertical sections confirmed that several pathways existed
   within the A and B horizons. These observations explained the observed
   distribution of diclofop within the system. The diclofop dissipated at
   all sample depths within 35 days of application Further studies were
   carried out to determine the fate of C-14 labeled diclofop-methyl in A,
   B and C horizon materials derived from the model. The results of these
   studies indicated that the maximum conversion of diclofop to CO2 in each
   of the horizons A, B and C was 1\%, 59\% and 75\%, respectively. These
   studies indicated that inhomogeneities in the reconstructed soil profile
   were the major path for penetration of diclofop below the rooting zone.
   Further, the diclofop rapidly dissipated and degraded at all depths in
   the unsaturated zone. In addition, the results show that these
   large-scale physical models can exhibit variability similar to that
   observed at field scale.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution is presented for one-dimensional vertical
   transport of volatile chemicals through the vadose zone to groundwater.
   The solution accounts for the important transport mechanisms of the
   steady advection of water and gas, diffusion and dispersion in water and
   gas, as well as adsorption, and first-order degradation. By assuming a
   linear, equilibrium partitioning between water, gas and the adsorbed
   chemical phases, the dependent variable in the mathematical model
   becomes the total resident concentration. The general solution was
   derived for cases having a constant initial total concentration over a
   discrete depth interval and a zero initial total concentration
   elsewhere. A zero concentration gradient is assumed at the groundwater
   table. Examples are given to demonstrate the application of the new
   solution for calculating the case of a non-uniform initial source
   concentration, and estimating the transport of chemicals to the
   groundwater and the atmosphere. The solution was also used to verify a
   numerical code caned VLEACH. We discovered an error in VLEACH, and found
   that the new solution agreed very well with the numerical results by
   corrected VLEACH. A simplified solution to predict the migration of
   volatile organic chemical due to the gas density effect has shown that a
   high source concentration may lead to significant downward advective
   gas-phase transport in a soil with a high air-permeability.}},

Title = {{APPLICATION OF GRAVITY DRAINAGE TO THE RECOVERY OF RESIDUAL LNAPL IN
   HOMOGENEOUS AND LENSED SAND PACKS}},

Abstract = {{Residual LNAPL (light non-aqueous-phase liquid) trapped as immobile,
   isolated blobs under the water table often constitutes a large fraction
   of the total amount of LNAPL in the subsurface. When the water table is
   lowered using pumping wells, these blobs are remobilized on contact with
   the layer of free LNAPL that lies on top of the water table. In the
   dewatered zone above the LNAPL layer, the LNAPL phase is kept continuous
   by LNAPL films which spread between water coating the pore walls and air
   occupying the centre of the pores. The LNAPL films can flow under the
   action of gravity forces, resulting in the accumulation of LNAPL on top
   of the water table where it can be recovered. Extremely small residual
   LNAPL saturations in the dewatered zone can be eventually achieved by
   gravity drainage. However, gravity drainage is a slow process due to the
   low conductivity of LNAPL films.
   Two experiments have been carried out in a two-dimensional laboratory
   model packed with sand. In the first experiment, the time scare involved
   in the recovery of residual Soltrol oil 100(R) by gravity drainage in a
   homogeneous sand pack was investigated. In the second experiment, a
   heterogeneous (lensed) sand pack has been used to study: (1) the
   influence of different-permeability lenses on the spatial distribution
   of LNAPL leaked at the top of the sand pack; (2) the effects of water
   table fluctuations; and (3) the recovery of residual LNAPL by gravity
   drainage in a lensed porous medium. Special attention has been given to
   the case where the lenses have smaller permeability than the surrounding
   medium.}},

Abstract = {{For fast-degraded chemicals such as 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D), their
   long persistent time in topsoils cannot be explained by the ordinary
   first-order kinetics of biodegradation that is commonly used in the
   simulation of chemical transport in soils. The Monod kinetics of
   biodegradation, which is usually defined as the mathematical
   relationship between the residual concentration of the growth-limiting
   substrate and the specific growth of degraders in laboratory reactors,
   was found to be responsible for the phenomenon of `'decelerated
   biodegradation''. To take advantage of both the simplicity of
   first-order kinetics in transport modeling and the realistic description
   of Monod kinetics for a physical situation, a simplified method was used
   to represent Monod kinetics with the corresponding pseudo first-order
   kinetics. Pseudo first-order constants fitted with Monod kinetics were
   later substituted into the transport model. A satisfactory agreement
   between field measurement and simulated results using these constants
   was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider transport of a nonlinearly adsorbing solute in
   a two-dimensional porous medium. The solute is continuously injected
   along a line source with a size equal to the transverse dimension of the
   domain. Adsorption is described by the Freundlich isotherm. The domain
   is assumed to be spatially variable and variation of hydraulic
   conductivity and adsorption coefficient is considered separately. Solute
   transport is solved by a mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian method. It is shown
   that nonlinear adsorption adds an extra requirement of taking into
   account pore scale dispersion while using Eulerian-Lagrangian solution
   methods. Solute dispersion is characterized in terms of spatial moments,
   where the pdf is the derivative of the transversely averaged
   concentration field. Results of numerical calculations are obtained for
   nonlinear and linear adsorption. It is shown that for large
   displacements an increase of pore scale dispersion leads to a decrease
   of average front spreading in case of nonlinear adsorption. The
   nonlinearity of adsorption opposes the local spreading in the
   longitudinal direction, whereas transverse spreading decreases the
   average front spreading. For larger displacements the front variance
   increases linearly with time. If transverse mixing is of the order of
   magnitude of the scale of heterogeneity, the front variance approaches a
   constant value, i.e. a traveling wave becomes apparent.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical solution is derived for the mass flux during remediation
   of a perfectly stratified aquifer by pumping. The idealized plume and
   the flow field are defined in a circular-cylinder geometry, where the
   aquifer is assumed to display spatial variability in the hydraulic
   conductivity, K, in the vertical direction only. The interaction between
   the solute in the mobile and immobile phases is described by the
   nonlinear Langmuir equation, which for a remediation case introduces
   additional dispersion to that caused by the heterogeneous flow
   conditions. Calculations for the case of variable K and constant
   sorption parameters show that the parameters expressing heterogeneity
   (sigma(Y)(2)) and sorption capacity (N-0) may cause changes of one order
   of magnitude, or more, in the time periods needed to fulfill the goals
   of remediation operations. For a given concentration, increased values
   of sigma(Y)(2) and/or N-0 lead to prolonged cleanup times. Furthermore,
   the effects of different cleanup goals, expressed as the mass fraction
   needed to be recovered, and the concentration-dependent effect, i.e. the
   variation in cleanup time with concentration for given natural
   conditions, are found to be important. Simultaneous spatial variability
   in K and N-0 is modeled assuming different degrees of negative
   correlation between these parameters. Calculation results based on very
   limited field data indicate that spatial variability in N-0 may have
   relatively small impact on cleanup times. The degree of negative
   correlation is found to be an important factor for determining whether
   spatial variability in N-0 needs to be included in the analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its simplicity and efficiency, the Muskingum-Cunge (M-C)
   method is a widely used modelling tool applied to flood routing
   problems. However, in the M-C method, there is an infinite number of
   combinations of spatial and temporal step sizes for which the solution
   is feasible and not all of these lead to accurate results. This has been
   a major criticism of the method. The same approach has been adopted here
   to solve the problem of nonlinear reactive solute transport. An
   optimised M-C scheme is proposed and tested which is very simple and
   efficient as compared with existing standard numerical solutions such as
   the Crank-Nicolson scheme. The optimisation principles are: (1) that the
   column holdup (area above the breakthrough curve normalised by the
   column length) is maintained; and (2) that the truncation error produced
   by the numerical scheme is minimised. The conditions derived are shown
   to be satisfactory for the mildly nonlinear reactions of the
   Freundlich-type typical of reactive chemical transport in soil.}},

Abstract = {{It is impractical to establish the detailed recoil range distribution
   and to measure the rough recoil surface of the porous media
   experimentally. Thus a computer based modelling approach is followed.
   The ion collision theory of nuclear physics provides the basics for
   calculating the recoil range distributions for radon within solid, water
   and air. The collision history is established by the modified Monte
   Carlo TRIM program. The recoil emanation power can also be calculated
   from the recoil range distributions. The recoil surface areas of the
   porous media are calculated through the fractal quantification of the
   synthetic porous media. The embedding effects are numerically calculated
   for solid, water and air, the three coexisting phases. The moisture
   distribution in the porous media is discussed based on the capillary
   theory. The simulation results indicate that the radon emanation rate is
   positively correlated with the moisture saturation in the porous media.
   The greater the moisture saturation is, the greater the possible radon
   emanation rate is. With moisture contents from 10\% up to 30\%, the
   recoil emanation rates quickly reach the emanation rate of the saturated
   condition. As the moisture reaches 30\%, a universal thin film on the
   pore surface is formed. This thin film is sufficient to stop the recoil
   radon from embedding into another part of the pore wall. The existing
   experimental data support this result.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1979, over 130,000 soil and water samples have been collected and
   analyzed for aldicarb in monitoring and research programs conducted in
   the U.S.A. Comprehensive field research studies have been conducted on
   40 plots located in 14 states and involving eight different crops. In
   addition, exploratory studies have been conducted in eight states
   including three in which field studies were not conducted at a later
   date. Drinking water samples have been collected in 39 states. Many
   laboratory studies have been performed to better define degradation
   mechanisms and rates. Modeling simulations have been performed to
   interpret field data and to properly apply the results to other
   situations.
   The movement and degradation of aldicarb residues in the unsaturated and
   saturated zone is a complex process affected by soil and hydrogeological
   properties, climatic conditions, and agricultural practices. These
   studies show that in most areas aldicarb residues degrade in the upper
   portion of the unsaturated zone. In the few areas where aldicarb
   residues reach groundwater, the combined effects of the primarily
   lateral movement of groundwater and the continuing degradation usually
   constrain aldicarb residues to shallow groundwater near treated fields.
   Most of the cases where aldicarb residues in drinking water have
   occurred in excess of the EPA (and WHO) health advisory level of 10 mu g
   L(-1) (a MCL of 7 mu g L(-1) is being proposed by the EPA) resulted from
   applications made at planting to potatoes. Generally, these instances of
   drinking water residues have been in the Northeast and Wisconsin;
   however, above guideline residues in drinking water wells have occurred
   as result of applications to lily bulbs in northern coastal California,
   sugar beets in Wyoming and citrus in central Florida. Management
   practices have been implemented to eliminate the occurrence of aldicarb
   residues in drinking water wells from future applications. These
   management practices have consisted of changes in application timing,
   application rates, and restrictions on applications near shallow
   drinking water wells in areas with vulnerable soils and shallow water
   tables. Almost all of the residues in drinking water wells currently
   exceeding guidelines are the result of applications made prior to the
   adoption of these management practices.}},

Abstract = {{A stepwise, time-varying pumping approach is developed to improve free
   phase oil recovery of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) from a
   homogeneous, unconfined aquifer. Stepwise pumping is used to contain the
   floating oil plume and obtain efficient free oil recovery. The pumping
   approach is developed using detailed simulations, multiple linear
   regression and graphical plots. The approach uses ARMOS(C), an areal
   two-dimensional multiphase flow, finite-element simulation model.
   Systematic simulations of free oil area changes to pumping rates are
   analyzed. Pumping rates are determined that achieve LNAPL plume
   containment at different times (i.e. 90, 180 and 360 days) for a
   planning period of 360 days. These pumping rates are used in reverse
   order as a stepwise (monotonically increasing) pumping strategy. This
   stepwise pumping strategy is analyzed further by performing additional
   simulations at different pumping rates for the last pumping period. The
   final stepwise pumping strategy is varied by factors of -25\% and +30\%
   to evaluate sensitivity in the free oil recovery process. Stepwise
   pumping is compared to steady pumping rates to determine the best free
   oil recovery strategy. Stepwise pumping is shown to improve oil recovery
   by increasing recovered oil volume (11\%) and decreasing residual oil
   (15\%) when compared with traditional steady pumping strategies. The
   best stepwise pumping strategy recovers more free oil by reducing the
   amount of residual oil left in the system due to pumping drawdown. This
   stepwise pumping approach can be used to enhance free oil recovery and
   provide for cost-effective design and management of LNAPL cleanup.}},

Abstract = {{The herbicide glufosinate-ammonium was persistent in aerobic sandy
   aquifer material in laboratory batch and field in situ microcosms when
   added at concentrations of 50-400 mu g L(-1). In contrast, the compound
   is biotransformed relatively quickly in surface soil. Glufosinate
   transformation and metabolite (3-methylphosphinyl-propionic acid)
   production in carbon-amended laboratory microcosms demonstrated that the
   aquifer system was carbon-limited with respect to glufosinate
   transformation. Microbiological tests showed that glufosinate ammonium
   and sodium-glufosinate can be used as a nitrogen source, in the presence
   of sufficient carbon. Glufosinate was not used by the native
   microorganisms as a source of phosphorus, nor metabolized as a sole
   carbon and energy source. Ammonium appeared to be preferred over
   glufosinate as a nitrogen source. When representative microbial strains
   isolated from the Borden aquifer were tested, most were
   glufosinate-ammonium tolerant. Complete inhibition of some isolates was
   demonstrated only at very high concentrations of 2-4 g L(-1). The
   research suggests that in an aquifer with a relatively low clay content
   and little labile organic carbon, such as the sandy aquifer at the field
   site, glufosinate will be persistent and transport will be essentially
   unretarded. The availability of alternate nitrogen sources was also
   indicated as a parameter that can affect persistence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a transfer function approach to mass transport
   modeling as a basis for comparing flowline routing or complete mixing
   models in two-dimensional fracture networks. The approach accounts for
   physical and chemical processes in the network, and for diffusion,
   retardation and kinetic decay in the matrix blocks. The fracture network
   is idealized in terms of fracture segments and intersections. By knowing
   the transfer function for each component, the response of the system can
   be evaluated by considering the interaction of all components.
   Mathematically, the transfer function for the single fracture is derived
   from an analytical solution for a single fracture, while the
   intersection component is approximated by either the complete mixing or
   the streamline routing model. In essence, the approach combines
   numerical and analytical approaches at the fracture scale to route mass
   through fracture segments and intersections. The analytical transfer
   function used in this application requires that mass diffusion not reach
   the centerline between fractures. Thus, there may be conditions where
   the transfer function may need to be modified to account for the
   geometry of the matrix blocks. The accuracy of the approach is examined
   through tests comparing results with an analytic solution and a simple
   network problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of a transfer function approach
   developed to model mass transport in a network of fractures subject to
   advection and dispersion within the fractures, and matrix diffusion. The
   model is able to treat mass mixing at fracture intersections by either
   flowline routing or complete mixing. This feature of the model is
   exploited in examining here the question of whether the choice of a
   particular model significantly influences the pattern of mass transport
   in a fractured medium. Previous studies appeared to have produced
   somewhat contradictory results. Our simulation experiments with the
   model involved a series of 12 trials with case of uniform flow imposed
   by constant-head boundaries and strongly radial flow created by an
   injection withdrawal doublet. The results showed that the case of
   uniform flow most emphasized the difference in the two mixing models,
   while in the case of strongly radial flow there was no difference in
   mass distributions measured through normalized breakthrough curves.
   These results can be interpreted in light of the possible patterns of
   inflow and outflow at a node, which show that mathematically the
   complete mixing model is the same as the streamflow routing model for
   three of the four possible flow conditions. Thus, the differences
   between the mixing models are only evident when flow conditions
   emphasize mixing via the one inflow/outflow pattern that is different.}},

Abstract = {{Underground storage and disposal of hazardous wastes require an
   understanding of groundwater flow and the ability to locate recharge and
   discharge. Usually, recharge and discharge occur at a transition zone
   where dispersion/advection, molecular diffusion and biogeochemical
   processes control the fate of contaminants leaving an underground
   facility. Appropriate landscape modelling for risk assessment cannot
   proceed until this interface is well defined and groundwater discharge
   can be mapped. Although discharge locations have traditionally been
   thought of as aquatic, the presence of animal licks suggests the
   possibility of terrestrial discharge. We have characterized a suspected
   terrestrial discharge, a well-used deer lick, (1) physically, through
   surficial mapping, and vegetation and soil profile analyses; (2)
   geophysically, through magnetic and very low-frequency electromagnetic
   tilt-angle surveys; (3) hydrogeologically, through water-table elevation
   measurements; (4) geochemically, through overburden analyses for U-238,
   Ra-226, Pb-210, Na, tritium, Cl and Cl-36/Cl atom ratios, as well as
   pore-water and groundwater analyses for pH, electrical conductivity (EC)
   and major anions and cations; and (5) thermally, through overburden-rock
   interface temperatures. Halophytic plants and sedges contained more Na,
   Cl and U-238 than averages reported in the literature. Lineament
   alignment, coincident with elevated groundwater EC, supported the
   presence and position of a subsurface fracture. Groundwater chemistry
   suggested that interfering runoff from a nearby ridge masked the
   chemical signatures expected of deep groundwater but attest to the weak
   and possibly ephemeral nature of this discharge. Interpretation of the
   geochemical data was supported by solute transport modelling. Good
   agreement between the predictions using an unsaturated soil model, a
   simple wetland compartment model and the observed profile implied that
   evapotranspiration, seasonal water-table fluctuations and flooding, and
   sorption of U-238 due to anoxia deep in the overburden are major
   processes shaping the overburden solute profile. This evidence strongly
   supported the hypothesis that the site is a location where deep
   groundwater (groundwater from depths of 500-1000 m) discharges.}},

Abstract = {{In many situations vapor-phase extraction procedures (e.g., soil
   venting, air sparging, and bioventing) may be suitable methods for
   remediating porous media contaminated by volatile organic compounds.
   This has led to increased study of operative processes in these systems,
   including aqueous-vapor phase mass transfer. Past work has shown the
   importance of the flow regime on this process, but a quantitative
   estimate of mass-transfer coefficients is lacking, especially for
   systems not confounded by uncertainties involving interfacial area
   between the phases. An experimental investigation was conducted to
   isolate the resistance to aqueous-vapor phase mass transfer at the phase
   boundary, using an ideal porous medium system. Mass-transfer
   coefficients were measured for toluene for a wide range of Reynolds
   numbers. An empirical model was fit to the data in dimensionless form.
   The mass-transfer model was coupled with an available interfacial area
   model, yielding a dimensionless expression for the mass-transfer rate
   coefficient. This expression was used to compare results from this work
   to three other experimental studies reported in the literature. These
   comparisons showed that for experiments where infiltrating water flowed
   uniformly within the porous medium, the predicted mass-transfer
   coefficients were within a factor of 5 of the measured coefficients.
   Mass transfer was significantly slower than the rate predicted, using
   the results from this work, in experiments where infiltrating water
   flowed nonuniformly.}},

Abstract = {{The transport of contaminants through porous media is influenced by
   several processes, two of the most important being sorption and
   transformation.  Several mathematical models have been developed to
   investigate the effects of sorption and transformation on contaminant
   transport.  Almost all of these models are based on the assumption of
   linear sorption.  However, it is well known that sorption of reactive
   contaminants is often nonlinear.  A mathematical model that describes
   the transport of solute undergoing nonlinear, rate-limited sorption and
   first-order transformation is used to investigate the effect of coupled
   transformation and non-linear sorption on contaminant transport. 
   Results of the analyses show that a model based on linear sorption
   cannot provide an accurate simulation of the transformation and
   transport of nonlinearly sorbing solutes when n is less than
   approximately 0.9.  In addition, the relative impact of nonlinear
   sorption on solute transport is mediated by the magnitude of
   transformation.  The nondimensional time required for a specified
   fraction of solute mass to be transformed during transport is influenced
   by nonlinear sorption.  These examples illustrate the intriguing effects
   that coupled processes can have on contaminant transport and which may
   be important for many contaminants of interest.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal venting is a remediation technique suitable to the liquid
   unsaturated zone to enhance recovery of less-volatile residual
   hydrocarbon contaminants.  Thermal venting is different to traditional
   soil venting because heated air instead of air at ambient conditions is
   applied to the contaminated zone.  The vapor pressure of a less-volatile
   contaminant is typically increased by temperature causing the gas-phase
   concentrations to increase by three- to five-fold over a temperature
   increase of 20-30-degrees-C.  The work described in this first paper
   provides the theoretical framework of analysis related to thermal
   venting.  The analysis included nonisothermal gas flow, thermal energy
   transport and multicomponent mass transport in a multiphase porous
   medium.  The transient gas flow analysis included the effect of
   temperature on fluid properties and gas compressibility.  The heat
   energy transport analysis was performed under the thermodynamic
   equilibrium condition with phase-summed effective thermal properties. 
   Multicomponent mass transport was performed under local equilibrium for
   partitioning between phases.  Model verification was performed to the
   extend possible using analytical and available experimental data for
   different physical processes.  The second paper of this two-part series
   will demonstrate the applicability of thermal venting technique through
   numerical simulations of hypothetical laboratory and field-scale
   scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The first part (Kaluarachchi and Islam, this issue) of this two-part
   series of papers developed the theoretical framework of analysis
   describing thermal venting using nonisothermal gas flow, heat energy
   transport and multicomponent mass transport.  The work presented in this
   paper demonstrated the applicability of thermal venting through a series
   of numerical simulations in one- and two-dimensional flow domains.  In
   both cases, a four-component hydrocarbon mixture consisting of volatile
   benzene, moderately-volatile n-dodecane, and less-volatile naphthalene
   and n-hexylbenzene in equal mass fraction was used.  The results from
   the one-dimensional laboratory-scale column simulations showed a total
   recovery of naphthalene, n-dodecane and n-hexylbenzene by thermal
   venting, where as corresponding removal by normal venting was < 33\% for
   the same time period.  Effect of thermal energy was negligible with
   volatile benzene due to high ambient vapor pressure.  Similar results
   were obtained from the two-dimensional field-scale simulations too.  The
   temperature distribution in the subsurface was affected by simultaneous
   evaporation of contaminants and moisture condensation from humid air. 
   The simulations also considered the parameter sensitivity to overall
   recovery.  The overall results of this theoretical analysis suggested
   that thermal venting may be a powerful remediation technique that is
   applicable to the unsaturated zone when normal soil venting fails to
   recover the less-volatile fraction of the residual plume.  However, the
   results of this analysis need to be experimentally validated for
   complete evaluation of the overall technology.}},

Abstract = {{Amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide is being used to treat groundwater
   contaminated with uranium(VI); the compound also has potential for use
   as a component in in situ chemical barriers.  To quantitatively evaluate
   its effectiveness in such applications, adsorption of uranium(VI) onto
   amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide was experimentally investigated under a
   wide range of uranium(VI) (8.40.10(-7)-2.10.10(-3) mol L-1; 0.2-500 mg
   L-1), sulfur(VI) (0-0.07 mol L-1; 0-2240 mg L-1) and carbon(IV)
   (0-0.0195 mol L-1; 0-234 mg L-1) concentrations, and pH-values (4-9.6). 
   The adsorption behavior of uranium(VI) (uranyl ion and its complexes) is
   similar to that of other cations; it exhibits a sharp rise in the extent
   of adsorption with increasing pH.  Interactions among uranyl complexes
   and surface sites are interpreted using a site complexation model. 
   Although the model does not incorporate electrostatics and includes only
   a single type of adsorption site, it provides a reasonable match to
   measured adsorption and proton exchange data.  The simplicity of the
   model and the resulting reduction in computational demand allow its
   efficient incorporation into coupled reaction-transport models.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of uranium onto amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide can be used for
   in situ containment of uranium(VI) present in mill tailings and for
   prevention of potential groundwater contamination.  Adsorption of
   uranium(VI) is strongly influenced by groundwater chemistry, especially
   pH and total dissolved carbonate concentration.  To evaluate the
   effectiveness of adsorption onto amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide as a
   containment barrier, the extent of uranium adsorption was quantified as
   a function of solution chemistry and other adsorption parameters.  The
   adsorption model was used within a coupled hydrogeochemical transport
   model to evaluate the conditions under which amorphous ferric
   oxyhydroxide can be effective in preventing groundwater contamination. 
   The modeling results depicted spatial and temporal evolution of the
   tailings-groundwater system, and permitted delineation of the
   uranium(VI) plume in groundwater under different scenarios.  The
   analysis showed that adsorption of uranium(VI) onto amorphous ferric
   oxyhydroxide can be an effective mechanism for preventing release of
   uranium(VI) into groundwater especially for neutral-pH mill tailings. 
   It was also found that essentially no retardation occurred in tailings
   with alkaline pore fluids.  An economic analysis showed that the
   amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide treatment can be applied to neutral-pH
   mill tailings in a cost-effective manner.  The results obtained in the
   study support the conceptual foundation of geochemical engineering in
   waste management.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to evaluate the potential for natural in situ
   biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's) in the
   subsurface at the site of a former manufactured gas plant. Fifty-seven
   samples of unconsolidated subsurface sediments were aseptically obtained
   from five boreholes across the site. Bacteria capable of aerobically
   degrading PAH's without an acclimation period were detected throughout
   shallow (2.7 m) and deep (24.7 m) areas of the subsurface in both
   relatively clean (<20 mu g L(-1) naphthalene) and contaminated (4400 mu
   g L(-1) naphthalene) zones. Significant (p < 0.05) quantities of
   naphthalene (8+/-3\% to 43+/-7\%) and/or phenanthrene (3+/-1\% to
   31+/-3\%) were mineralized in sediment-groundwater microcosms during 4
   weeks of aerobic incubation at 22 degrees C. Three samples out of 11
   were able to aerobically mineralize significant quantities of benzene
   (6+/-2\% to 24+/-1\%). Of 11 samples tested for anaerobic
   mineralization, naphthalene biodegradation (7+/-1\% to 13+/-2\%) in the
   presence of NO3- was observed in two samples. Compound removals were
   first order with respect to substrate concentration during the first
   10-15 days of incubation. Compound biodegradation plateaued in the later
   stages of incubation (15-40 days), most likely from diminishing
   bioavailability and nutrient and oxygen depletion.
   Population densities in the sediments were typically low, with viable
   aerobic counts ranging from 0 to 10(5) CFU gdw(-1), viable anaerobic
   counts ranging from 0 to 10(4) CFU gdw(-1),and total counts (AODC)
   usually 10-fold greater than viable counts. Total counts exhibited a
   strong (p<0.01) positive correlation with sample grain size. Viable
   aerobic and anaerobic populations commonly occurred in the same sample,
   suggesting the presence of facultative anaerobes. Bacteria were
   metabolically active in samples from groundwaters with low pH (3.7) and
   high naphthalene concentrations (11,000 mu g L(-1)). Data from these
   enumeration and microcosm studies suggest that natural in situ
   biodegradation is occurring at the site.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation programs proposed for decommissioned sulphide tailings may
   include the addition of a cover layer rich in organic-carbon material
   such as sewage sludge or composted municipal waste. These covers are
   designed to consume oxygen and prevent the oxidation of underlying
   sulphide minerals. The aerobic and anaerobic degradation of such
   organic-carbon-rich waste can release soluble organic compounds to
   infiltrating precipitation water. In laboratory experiments, and in
   natural settings, biotic and abiotic interactions between similar
   dissolved organic compounds and ferric-bearing secondary minerals have
   been observed to result in the reductive dissolution of ferric
   (oxy)hydroxides and the release of ferrous iron to pore waters. In
   weathered tailings, oxidation of sulphide minerals typically results in
   the formation of abundant ferric-bearing secondary precipitates near the
   tailings surface. These secondary precipitates may contain high
   concentrations of potentially toxic metals, either coprecipitated with
   or adsorbed onto ferric (oxy)hydroxides. Reductive dissolution
   reactions, resulting from the addition of the organic-carbon covers, may
   remobilize metals previously attenuated near the tailings surface. To
   assess the potential for metal release to tailings pore water by
   reductive dissolution reactions, a laboratory study was conducted on
   weathered tailings collected from the Nickel Rim mine tailings
   impoundment near Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. This site was selected for
   study because it is representative of many tailings sites. Mineralogical
   study indicates that sulphide minerals originally present in the vadose
   zone at the time of tailings deposition have been replaced by a series
   of secondary precipitates. The most abundant secondary minerals are
   goethite, gypsum and jarosite. Scanning electron microscopy, coupled
   with elemental analyses by X-ray energy dispersion analysis, and
   electron microprobe analysis indicate that trace metals including Ni, Cr
   and Cu are associated with these secondary minerals. To assess the
   masses of trace metals associated with each of the dominant secondary
   mineral phases, a series of extraction procedures was used. The masses
   of metals determined in three fractions (water soluble, reducible and
   residual) suggest that the greatest accumulation of metals is in the
   reducible fraction. These measurements indicate that high concentrations
   of metals are potentially available for release by reductive dissolution
   of the ferric-bearing secondary minerals. The actual mass of metals that
   can be released by. this mechanism will depend on a number of
   site-specific characteristics, particularly the intensity of the
   reducing conditions established near the tailings surface.}},

Abstract = {{Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) was used to monitor solute breakthrough
   curves (BTC's) in 30 saturated undisturbed soil columns collected along
   a 35-m-long transect in the field.  The BTC's were obtained by relating
   the bulk soil electrical conductivity, EC(a), to the relative
   concentration of a KCl solute pulse applied to the soil surface.  Values
   of EC(a) were estimated by measuring the soil's impedance to an
   electromagnetic wave generated by a cable tester.  Parallel two-rod TDR
   probes inserted horizontally at a depth of 10 cm were used to monitor
   the soil's impedance during transport of the KCl solute pulse. 
   Calculated experimental time moments indicated that the BTC data were
   very variable in time and space.  This variability was attributed in
   part to the relatively small volume of soil sampled with the TDR probes,
   and in part to the natural heterogeneity of the sandy loam soil.  The
   observed BTC's were classified into three groups.  One group showed
   bell-shaped curves consistent with the classical convection-dispersion
   equation (CDE).  A second group was characterized by early breakthrough
   and long tailing.  The BTC's in this group could be described by a
   mobile-immobile transport model (MIM).  A third group of BTC's showed
   irregular shapes with several peaks.  Time moments were used to compare
   the estimated (from the moments), fitted (CDE and MIM) and independently
   measured pore-water velocities.  The disparities between the observed
   and fitted velocities suggest that for structured soil several TDR
   probes may be necessary in order to obtain reasonable estimates of
   column-scale solute transport behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of volatile organic chemicals during transport has received
   little attention in the past.  In this study we report the results of a
   series of experiments on toluene movement through soil columns of
   different length in sterilized, pre-exposed and unexposed soil.  Toluene
   was added to 25-cm-diameter soil columns through an inlet chamber that
   maintained a constant concentration throughout the experiment.  The
   toluene diffused through the soil to an outlet chamber at the top which
   was continuously swept with humidified air and samples were periodically
   analysed to determine toluene flux.  The first experiment, conducted
   under sterilized conditions, was used to measure the soil gas diffusion
   coefficient, and subsequent experiments in which biodegradation occurred
   were used to estimate the degradation rate coefficient by fitting the
   outflow to a mathematical model.  The degradation rate was very rapid
   under both pre-exposed and unexposed soil conditions, corresponding to a
   half-life of approximately 2 h when bacterial activity reached high
   levels.  Prior to this stage, the volatilization flux was very erratic,
   implying that growth rates of the bacteria were out of phase with the
   transport process.  Overall, the degradation process was not well
   described by a first-order model until the population stabilized. 
   Pre-exposure of the soil to the substrate prior to the transport
   experiment greatly increased the rate of removal of toluene during
   transport.  Under such conditions, a 30-cm cover could virtually stop
   volatilization losses of the compound when the inlet concentration was
   well below saturation, and could decrease it by a factor of
   greater-than-or-equal-to 30 even when the inlet concentration was
   saturated.}},

Abstract = {{The solubility and sorption of three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (2-methylnaphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene) by two soils were measured
   in water and low-volume-fraction (<30\%) methanol-water mixtures.  A
   large increase in the solution hase concentration of our analytes was
   observed as the methanol concentration was increased from 0\% to 30\% by
   volume, and was much more pronounced for the more nonpolar compounds. 
   The solubility enhancement of our analytes exhibited a similar
   semi-logarithmic relationship that appeared to be linear in low
   co-solvent concentrations, but deviated from linearity as the methanol
   concentration increased beyond 20\% volume fraction.  An inverse
   relationship was observed for hydrophobic organic compound soil
   partition coefficients as a function of increasing co-solvent.  A
   semi-empirical equation was successfully applied to explain our
   observations if the requisite parameters needed to calibrate the model
   were elucidated from low-co-solvent solubility enhancement experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetically-controlled volatilization and dissolution of
   nonaqueous-phase liquids (NAPL's) in the unsaturated (vadose) zone are a
   more general model as compared to the usually used local equilibrium
   model of mass transfer.  This paper presents a one-dimensional vertical
   model of kinetically-controlled diffusive transport of organic vapors
   pertinent to pollution caused by a relatively long, ground
   surface-originating, mainly horizontally-spread leak of NAPL, the
   volatile compound of which undergoes sorption and degradation in the
   soil.  Analytical solutions of this model are applicable to homogeneous
   soils with ground surface fully open to the atmosphere.  Application of
   the solutions to several examples demonstrates the role of
   kinetically-controlled volatilization and dissolution at both early and
   advanced stages of the transport process.  Asymptotic analysis of the
   outlined solutions is employed in order to examine the depletion of the
   contaminant source.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of environmental conditions and soil characteristics on
   the retention and volatilisation of kerosene hydrocarbons in soils is
   investigated through laboratory experiments in six different glacial and
   post-glacial soils.  The soils ranged between 0.55 and 1.80 g cm-3 in
   density, 29\% and 70\% in porosity, 0.4\% and 28\% in organic matter
   content, and 0\% and 51\% in clay content.  The water retention capacity
   (WRC) could be estimated on basis of the bulk density and the sand,
   silt, clay and organic matter contents for many of the soils; for these
   soils a simple linear relation was identified between WRC and the
   kerosene retention capacity (KRC).  Furthermore, the combined effects of
   soil porosity and soil moisture content on the KRC were found to be
   significant and could be quantified by a linear relationship.  For
   moisture contents that can be expected in humid climate zones, the KRC
   will be relatively low and exhibit small variations between different
   soils.  The effect of temperature on KRC was found to be small.  The
   kerosene volatilisation flux was quantified as a function of time by a
   power law relationship, based on the initial surface density of kerosene
   in the soil and the prevailing temperature.  The C9-C11 components of
   the kerosene had selectivities above zero and were thus removed
   preferentially, while the C14 and C15 components were characterised by
   negative the soil by increasing the concentration of the C14 and C15
   components.  The results for the different soil types indicate that the
   organic matter content of the soil affects the selective volatilisation,
   possibly through hydrophobic adsorption on surfaces, whereas the clay
   content appears to be less influential.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional, multiphase flow experiment was conducted in the
   laboratory. The saturation distribution of a lighter than water
   non-aqueous-phase liquid (LNAPL) as it migrated through a
   variably-saturated sand medium was determined using image analysis
   techniques. The pressures in the water and LNAPL phases were measured
   using hydrophilic and hydrophobic porous cups connected to a series of
   pressure transducers and a data acquisition system, The LNAPL inflow and
   water outflow were also recorded. A series of capillary
   pressure-saturation experiments were conducted for each two-phase
   system. The capillary pressures recorded by the pressure transducers
   were used to calculate the phase saturations based on a fully hysteretic
   capillary pressure-saturation algorithm. The static equilibrium
   capillary pressure-saturation relationships proved to be invalid
   immediately ahead of the LNAPL front. The capillary pressure-saturation
   relationship appeared to be dynamic for short periods of time as the
   LNAPL front arrived at each transducer location. The presence of an
   entrapped air phase as the LNAPL migrated through the unsaturated zone
   clearly affected the migration of the LNAPL and the maximum LNAPL
   saturation reached in the sand medium.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional, multiphase flow experiment was modelled using a
   finite-difference, multiphase flow and transport code. The laboratory
   experiment consisted of a lighter-than-water, non-aqueous-phase liquid
   (LNAPL) spill in a variably-saturated sand. The numerical model allows a
   non-hysteretic, a partially hysteretic and a fully hysteretic solution.
   The fully hysteretic algorithm accounts for fluid entrapment, saturation
   hysteresis and hysteresis in the relative permeability terms. The
   partially hysteretic model allows air-phase entrapment within the LNAPL
   as the LNAPL migrates through the unsaturated zone. The fully hysteretic
   model results were compared to the laboratory pressures and saturations.
   The importance of hysteresis is clearly illustrated; however, the
   inclusion of hysteresis substantially increases the computation and
   storage requirements. The partially hysteretic model predicts the
   movement of the LNAPL front relatively well but does not account for the
   hysteretic conditions which persist during the redistribution of the
   LNAPL after the spill was complete. The laboratory experiment was
   modelled using an implicit in pressure, explicit in saturation (IMPES)
   solution and a fully implicit solution. The fully hysteretic IMPES
   solution with two-point upstream weighting of the relative permeability
   terms resulted in the best representation of the experimental data for
   the model scenarios evaluated.}},

   very fast degradation with no or only short lag phases and with very
   little variation among localities; (2) 2,4-dichlorophenol was degraded
   in all localities and showed large variability among localities with
   respect to lag phases (0-50 days) and some variation with respect to
   degradation periods (20-40 days); and (3) nitrobenzene, o-nitrophenol,

   variability among localities ranging from no degradation within 149 days
   in some localities to degradation within 2 days in other localities. The

   CONTAMINANTS FROM LAND-DISPOSAL SITES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},

Abstract = {{A composite modeling approach is presented for simulating the
   three-dimensional (3-D) subsurface transport of dissolved contaminants
   with transformation products. The approach is based on vertical
   infiltration and contaminant transport in the unsaturated zone and 3-D
   groundwater flow and contaminant migration in the saturated zone.
   Moisture movement and groundwater flow are considered to be steady, but
   contaminant transport is treated as transient. The model allows for
   advection, dispersion, linear or nonlinear equilibrium sorption, and
   first-order biochemical transformation of either a single contaminant
   species, or a multi-species, straight or branched, decay chain. The
   model is designed for regulatory decision making using Monte Carlo
   analysis. For such applications considerable emphasis is placed on
   computational efficiency and robustness of the model. An efficient and
   robust semi-analytical method is used to perform the steady-state
   solution for infiltration through the unsaturated zone. A variety of
   transport solutions, corresponding to transient or steady state, and
   linear or nonlinear sorption conditions, are incorporated in the model.
   For transient linear transport, the Laplace transform technique is used.
   The transformed unsaturated-zone transport equation is solved
   analytically; the transformed saturated-zone transport equation is
   solved numerically using the Laplace transform-Galerkin (LTG) technique
   which permits a nonuniform groundwater flow field, reflecting the
   influence of locally higher infiltration from the waste source. The
   model contains fully 3-D solutions for flow and transport in the
   saturated zone, as well as two-dimensional solutions for vertical
   cross-sectional and areal scenarios. Model formulations and solution
   schemes are verified by comparison against a fully 3-D, variably
   saturated flow and transport code for a hypothetical problem which
   represents a typical landfill. The model is applied also to simulate a
   controlled release field experiment and the model predictions compare
   well with groundwater monitoring data for the site.}},

Abstract = {{Multicomponent transport experiments were performed with four major
   cations, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+, in laboratory columns packed with a
   non-calcareous soil. The breakthrough curves are explained
   quantitatively with a box model including cation exchange. We use a
   single set of selectivity coefficients, an independently verified value
   of the cation-exchange capacity (CEC), and an adjusted value of the
   Peclet number. This Peclet number is smaller than the value determined
   from independent tracer experiments. The model is able to predict all
   experimentally observed breakthrough curves quite well. The selectivity
   coefficients determined from binary exchange experiments prove
   unreliable for the prediction of multicomponent experiments. We propose
   to estimate the selectivity coefficients by directly fitting the
   multicomponent breakthrough curves. Their shape is a very sensitive
   function of the values of these coefficients. Concepts from non-linear
   chromatography can be used in order to interpret several qualitative
   features of the breakthrough curves.}},

Abstract = {{Greater understanding of the processes affecting solute transport in
   field soils is required to meet the ever-increasing demand for improved
   management of field-applied chemicals. In this study, we sought to
   elucidate the effect of distinct interfaces between horizons of
   strongly-contrasting texture on solute transport. Field experiments of
   solute transport were performed on a soil consisting of three layers of
   different texture in which porous cup samplers had been installed at
   four depths in twenty sites. Similar experiments were done in a
   lysimeter of area 2m(2) and 1m deep. Convection-dispersion modelling was
   first attempted using the lysimeter data. This was successful, provided
   that the surface 250 mm of soil were not used to calibrate the model
   coefficients. Layering within the profile appeared to have little effect
   on solute transport. The transport porosity was found to be just
   two-thirds of the water-filled porosity. However, convection-dispersion
   modelling of the field data was not particularly successful, probably
   due to the spatially-variable nature of solute transport coupled with
   variation in the water application pattern. Textural differences in the
   soil seemed to be overwhelmed by both small-scale heterogeneity of water
   application and local variation of solute movement through the soil,
   especially near to the soil surface. It appears that the hydraulic
   processes occurring in the surface soil require more attention by
   modellers of solute transport than they have been afforded in the past.}},

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Gas-water phase mass transfer was examined in a homogeneous sand with
   both the gas and water phase mobile: water was infiltrated from the top
   of the sand column while benzene-laden air flowed upward from the
   bottom. Mass-transfer limitations for this situation may be important
   for applications of bioventing, where water and nutrients are added at
   the ground surface simultaneously with induced air movement to carry
   oxygen and volatile organics to microbial populations. Gas- and
   water-phase samples indicate that gas-water phase mass transfer was
   sufficiently fast that equilibrium between gas and water phases was
   achieved at all sampling locations within the porous medium. Lower-bound
   estimates for the gas-water mass-transfer rate coefficient show that
   mass transfer was at least 10-40 times larger than predictions made from
   an empirical model developed for gas-water phase mass transfer in an
   identical porous medium. A water-phase tracer test demonstrates that
   water flow was much more uniform in this study than in those earlier
   experiments, which is a likely explanation for the differing rates of
   gas-water phase mass transfer. It is hypothesized that the liquid
   distribution in previous laboratory experiments was less uniform because
   of preferential flow paths due to wetting front instabilities. Gas-water
   phase mass-transfer rate coefficients reported in this investigation are
   for an ideal situation of uniform water infiltration: mass-transfer
   rates in field soils are expected to be significantly smaller.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional through-flow air venting of sand containing liquid
   hydrocarbon mixtures has been investigated to simulate soil vapor
   extraction processes in uniform soils. An isothermal transport model has
   been developed to predict the spatially and temporally varying
   composition of the liquid mixture within the contaminated region during
   the venting process. Experiments were performed to determine these
   changing in situ liquid concentrations in a packed column, and
   comparisons were made to the predicted values. Results showed that
   during through-flow venting, selective evaporation of the
   higher-volatility compounds led to the propagation of multiple
   evaporation fronts. These fronts corresponded to the location of
   vaporization of each compound, and the velocity of each front depended
   on the volatility of the compound. Thus, evaporation fronts of
   higher-volatility compounds propagated more quickly through the column
   than those of lower-volatility compounds for equal volumes of each
   compound initially emplaced into the liquid mixture. Condensation of
   lower-volatility compounds was also observed at the evaporation fronts
   of higher-volatility compounds, leading to a continuous accumulation of
   the lower-volatility compounds downstream of their evaporation fronts.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model is presented for areal analyses of the
   three-dimensional (3-D) flow behavior of non-aqueous-phase liquids
   (NAPL's) in groundwater systems. The model is designed for specific
   application to chemical or petroleum spills and leaks, and remedial
   design and evaluation of a NAPL-contaminated site. The mathematical
   formulation is based on vertical integration of the 3-D two-phase flow
   equations and incorporation of the modified concept of
   gravity-segregated vertical equilibrium (GSVE) which yields sharp
   interfaces separating the zones of mobile NAPL and groundwater.
   History-dependent pseudo constitutive relations are developed for
   LNAPL's and DNAPL's (light and dense NAPL's) scenarios taking into
   account the effects of residual saturations. Owing to the
   sharp-interface assumption, the soil capillary pressure and relative
   permeability curves are not needed in the evaluation of pseudo
   functions. Efficient and mass-conservative nonlinear numerical
   techniques are adopted for solving the governing equations and treating
   practical boundary conditions which include injection and recovery wells
   and trenches. Simulation and application examples are provided to
   demonstrate verification and utility of the model. Numerical results
   obtained using the sharp-interface modeling approach are compared with
   analytical solutions and rigorous multiphase numerical solutions that
   account for vertical flow components and capillary effects. The
   verification results show the validity of the GSVE modeling assumptions
   and accuracy of the proposed formulation and computational schemes in
   predicting the NAPL recovery. The numerical study also indicates that
   the present model is highly efficient and is thus suitable for
   preliminary analyses of site-specific problems with limited data and
   personal computer resources.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater is an essential source of water in Arctic regions due to
   largely frozen surface water resources. Since the development of Alaskan
   oil fields and the construction of the trans-Alaska pipeline, there have
   been a large number of accidental oil spillages in the tundra. The
   physico-, thermo- and ecosystem of the Arctic has unique features
   requiring special attention due to low temperatures and the presence of
   ice. Furthermore, a hot oil spill is subjected to large variations of
   temperature which creates a dominant impact on flow and phase behavior.
   Modeling studies of phase-separate contaminants for isothermal
   conditions neglect these crucial factors. A predictive model is
   developed herein, to simulate the transport and fate of multicomponent
   petroleum products in Arctic soils and groundwater.
   The model is based on identification and quantification of the
   significant physical, thermal, chemical and biological processes, and
   construction of mathematical representations of these phenomena to
   describe the transport and fate of petroleum spills in frozen soils.
   Since a petroleum product consists of many chemically and biologically
   reactive components, a general compositional-type model is developed to
   describe multiphase transport of the petroleum products, or any other
   multicomponent, phase-separate contaminant under non-isothermal
   conditions. The model incorporates thermodynamic principles to quantify
   phase partitioning of contaminant components and phase separation.
   Aerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbon constituents is incorporated into
   the formulation through Monod-type kinetics. A limit on biodegradation
   is imposed when oxygen is depleted from the system beyond which the
   biodegradation rate depends on the flux rate of oxygen.}},

   dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the groundwater was also studied.
   There was less sorption of all three metals from groundwater than from
   NaNO3 for large pH ranges. Sorption of Cd2+ and Pb2+ seemed to be due to
   a combination of ion exchange and surface complexation. This hypothesis
   was supported by agreement between an ion exchange/surface complexation
   model and the sorption data. There was less Cu2+ sorption from
   groundwater than from NaNO3 for pH-values > 5, but Cu2+ sorption from
   artificial groundwater was the same as from NaNO3. Sorption of Cu2+ was
   apparently by surface complexation only. For fixed pH and variable total
   Cu, there was less Cu2+ Sorption from groundwater than from NaNO3, which
   is consistent with the formation of nonsorbing soluble complexes with
   DOM. A soluble complexation/surface complexation model reproduced the
   trends in the data, which supports the hypothesis of nonsorbing Cu

Abstract = {{The activity of metal ions in sulphidic solutions is buffered
   heterogeneously due to the formation of sparingly soluble metal-sulphide
   precipitates. Assuming a pure metal-sulphide phase (MeS) the metal ion
   activities are controlled by the activity of H2S and the pH: \{Me2+\} =
   K(so)/\{S2-\} = K(so)\{H+\}2/\{H2S\}K(al)K(a2) = K(s2)\{H+\}2/\{H2S\}.
   The total metal ion concentration, however, can be increased by
   complexing ligands. The interaction between metal ions, H2S and other
   ligands can be quantified by use of the two master variables, pH2S (= -
   log\{H2S\}) and pH, both of which can be measured easily (pH2S by use of
   a pH2S electrode cell). A pH2S scale is defined with sulphide as the
   strongest coordination partner for B-type metal ions. Consequently, the
   coordination tendency of metal ions in sulphidic solutions is discussed
   relative to the activity of sulphide, respectively to that of its
   protonated form, H2S.
   This concept is applied on data from an experimental study on
   trace-metal mobility in sulphidic leachate during anaerobic digestion of
   solid wastes. The fate of Zn, Cd and Fe can be predicted using
   double-logarithmic pH-pH2S diagrams. A high potential for metal leaching
   by volatile fatty acids, produced in high amounts during the anaerobic
   digestion process, was observed for Fe, and to a lesser extent for Zn.
   In contrast, the solubility of Cd is controlled by the intrinsic
   solubility of a sulphidic system, i.e. the presence of hydrogen sulphide
   complexes. In case of Pb and Cu high supersaturations were observed with
   respect to the intrinsic solubility, probably due to the presence of
   unknown strong ligands. In this case a procedure is introduced how to
   estimate the concentration and conditional stability constants of a
   metal-ligand complex by use of the three easily measurable variables
   pH2S, pH and total metal concentration.
   A method is described to calculate intrinsic saturation indices, where
   the formation of hydrogen sulphide complexes as an intrinsic property of
   sulphidic solutions is considered. Intrinsic saturation indices can be
   used as a criterion for the presence of metal-leaching ligands in a
   sulphidic system.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional, three-phase numerical model is presented for
   simulating the movement of non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPL's) through
   porous and fractured media. The model is designed for practical
   application to a wide variety of contamination and remediation scenarios
   involving light or dense NAPL's in heterogeneous subsurface systems. The
   model formulation is first derived for three-phase flow of water, NAPL
   and air (or vapor) in porous media. The formulation is then extended to
   handle fractured systems using the dual-porosity and discrete-fracture
   modeling approaches The model accommodates a wide variety of boundary
   conditions, including withdrawal and injection well conditions which are
   treated rigorously using fully implicit schemes. The three-phase
   formulation collapses to its simpler forms when air-phase dynamics are
   neglected, capillary effects are neglected, or two-phase air-liquid,
   liquid-liquid systems with one or two active phases are considered. A
   Galerkin procedure with upstream weighting of fluid mobilities, storage
   matrix lumping, and fully implicit treatment of nonlinear coefficients
   and well conditions is used. A variety of nodal connectivity schemes
   leading to finite-difference, finite-element and hybrid spatial
   approximations in three dimensions are incorporated in the formulation.
   Selection of primary variables and evaluation of the terms of the
   Jacobian matrix for the Newton-Raphson linearized equations is
   discussed. The various nodal lattice options, and their significance to
   the computational time and memory requirements with regards to the
   block-Orthomin(C) solution scheme are noted. Aggressive time-stepping
   schemes and under-relaxation formulas implemented in the code further
   alleviate the computational burden.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the verification and application of the
   three-dimensional (3-D) multiphase flow model presented by Huyakom et
   al. (Part 1 in this issue) for assessing contamination due to subsurface
   releases of non-aqueous-phase liquids (NAPL's). Attention is focussed on
   situations involving one-, two- and three-dimensional flow through
   porous media. The model formulations and numerical schemes are tested
   for highly nonlinear field conditions. The utility and accuracy of
   various simplifications to certain simulation scenarios are assessed.
   Five simulation examples are included for demonstrative purposes. The
   first example verifies the model for vertical flow and compares the
   performance of the fully three-phase and the passive-air-phase
   formulations. Air-phase boundary conditions are noted to have
   considerable effects on simulation results. The second example verifies
   the model for cross-sectional analyses involving LNAPL and DNAPL
   migration. Finite-difference (5-point) and finite-element (9-point)
   spatial approximations are compared for different grid aspect ratios.
   Unless corrected, negative-transmissivity conditions were found to have
   undesirable impact on the finite-element solutions. The third example
   provides a model validation against laboratory experimental data on
   5-spot water-flood treatment of oil reservoirs. The sensitivity to grid
   orientation is noted for the finite-difference schemes. The fourth
   example demonstrates model utility in characterizing the 3-D migration
   of LNAPL and DNAPL from surface sources. The final example presents a
   modeling study of air sparging. Critical parameters affecting the
   performance of air-sparging system are examined. In general, the
   modeling results indicate sparging is more effective in water-retentive
   soils, and larger values of sparge influence radius may be achieved for
   certain anisotropic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In order to gain insight into mechanisms of hexachloroethane reduction,
   hexa- and pentachloroethane transformation rates were measured in
   anaerobic groundwater samples. For samples spiked with
   pentachloroethane, disappearance of pentachloroethane was accompanied by
   tetrachloroethylene production. Transformation rates were similar in
   unpoisoned and in HgCl2-poisoned samples, and rates were within +/- 20\%
   of predictions based on measured pH and second-order dehydrochlorination
   rate constants determined in clean laboratory systems, indicating that
   the fate of pentachloroethane in this system is dominated by abiotic
   reactions. No hexachloroethane transformation was observed in
   HgCl2-poisoned samples, whereas in unpoisoned samples, hexachloroethane
   disappearance was accompanied by production of tetrachloroethylene as
   well as traces of pentachloroethane. Although only minor amounts of
   pentachloroethane accumulated, as much as 30\% of the hexachloroethane
   transformation pathway proceeds via a pentachloroethane intermediate.
   This suggests that the microbial reduction of hexachloroethane proceeds
   at least in part through a free-radical mechanism. To the extent that
   hexachloroethane reduction to tetrachloroethylene occurs through a
   pentachloroethane intermediate, the first step in the sequence, the
   microbially-mediated step, is the slow step; the subsequent abiotic
   dehydrohalogenation step occurs much more rapidly.}},

Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{A phenomenological model for transient NAPL dissolution, referred to as
   the `'sphere'' model, is developed. In this model, the mass-transfer
   coefficient and specific surface areas are quantified independently. The
   unique aspect of this work is the assumption that the complex
   distribution of NAPL blob shapes and sizes can be represented by a set
   of spheres with a range of diameters. The sphere diameter distributions
   are determined through the entrapment, polymerization and
   characterization of styrene blobs in sandy media. Mass-transfer
   coefficients are estimated from experimental measurements of the
   dissolution of naphthalene emplaced as solid spheres within sandy media.
   The phenomenological model describing NAPL dissolution rates is
   incorporated into a solute transport equation and solved with a
   numerical simulator. Simulations show that the sphere model can be
   calibrated to experimental NAPL dissolution data from column studies
   presented previously. The inclusion of a range of sphere sizes resulted
   in a model which represents experimental data better than a model based
   on mono-size spheres. The sphere model also adequately predicts
   dissolution for NAPL's with a range of solubilities provided the NAPL
   blob size distributions can be adequately estimated.
   The primary limitation of the sphere model is the quantity of input data
   required to describe the distribution of effective sphere sizes. While
   these data requirements are extensive, the ability to define the NAPL
   blob distribution within the model makes the sphere model much more
   versatile for extrapolation to heterogeneous systems than other
   available dissolution models.}},
