Abstract = {{A phenomenological model for transient NAPL dissolution, referred to as
   the `'sphere'' model, is developed. In this model, the mass-transfer
   coefficient and specific surface areas are quantified independently. The
   unique aspect of this work is the assumption that the complex
   distribution of NAPL blob shapes and sizes can be represented by a set
   of spheres with a range of diameters. The sphere diameter distributions
   are determined through the entrapment, polymerization and
   characterization of styrene blobs in sandy media. Mass-transfer
   coefficients are estimated from experimental measurements of the
   dissolution of naphthalene emplaced as solid spheres within sandy media.
   The phenomenological model describing NAPL dissolution rates is
   incorporated into a solute transport equation and solved with a
   numerical simulator. Simulations show that the sphere model can be
   calibrated to experimental NAPL dissolution data from column studies
   presented previously. The inclusion of a range of sphere sizes resulted
   in a model which represents experimental data better than a model based
   on mono-size spheres. The sphere model also adequately predicts
   dissolution for NAPL's with a range of solubilities provided the NAPL
   blob size distributions can be adequately estimated.
   The primary limitation of the sphere model is the quantity of input data
   required to describe the distribution of effective sphere sizes. While
   these data requirements are extensive, the ability to define the NAPL
   blob distribution within the model makes the sphere model much more
   versatile for extrapolation to heterogeneous systems than other
   available dissolution models.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of aqueous surfactant solutions to recover
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE) entrapped in Ottawa sand was evaluated in four
   column experiments. Residual PCE was emplaced by injecting C-14-labeled
   PCE into water-saturated soil columns and displacing the free product
   with water. Miscible displacement experiments were conducted before and
   after PCE entrapment to determine the influence of residual PCE on
   column dispersivities. The first two column studies involved the
   injection of a 4\% solution of polyoxyethylene (POE) (20) sorbitan
   monooleate, resulting in the removal of 90\% and 97\% of the residual
   PCE from 20-30- and 40-120-mesh Ottawa sand, respectively. Although
   micellar solubilization of PCE was the primary mode of recovery in these
   experiments, this process was shown to be rate-limited based on: (a) the
   disparity between initial steady-state concentrations of PCE in the
   column effluent and equilibrium values measured in batch experiments;
   and (b) the increase in effluent concentrations of PCE following periods
   of flow interruption. In the latter two experiments, surfactant
   solutions containing mixtures of sodium sulfosuccinates removed > 99\%
   of the residual PCE from soil columns packed with 40-270-mesh Ottawa
   sand. Approximately 80\% of the PCE was mobilized as a separate organic
   liquid after flushing with < 100 mL of these surfactant solutions. This
   study demonstrates the capacity of surfactant flushing to enhance the
   recovery of residual PCE from Ottawa sand and indicates that ultra-low
   interfacial tensions (< 0.001 dyn cm-1) are not required to achieve
   significant PCE mobilization when buoyancy forces are important. The
   potential for displacement of dense nonaqueous-phase liquids as a
   separate organic phase should, therefore, be evaluated during the
   selection of surfactant formulations for aquifer remediation.}},

Abstract = {{Capillary pressure relationships in a porous medium determine the
   distribution of immiscible fluids under static conditions and can
   largely influence the movement of the fluids when the system is not at
   equilibrium. Theory predicts that for a given porous medium, the effect
   of different fluid properties or changes in temperature on capillary
   pressure are due to changes in interfacial tension and contact angle of
   the system. The capillary pressure-saturation curves measured here for
   hydrocarbon oil-water do not have a constant capillary pressure ratio
   with saturation when compared to the water-air system, and changes in
   ratio were found when comparing the water-air curves measured at
   different temperatures. Thus, the scaling theory based on interfacial
   tensions and contact angles does not adequately account for differences
   in capillary pressures due to different fluid pairs or temperatures.
   Also, the curves show the residual wetting and nonwetting phase
   saturations are greatly affected by temperature and sometimes by the
   fluid pair, which is not accounted for in the scaling theory and cannot
   be predicted. When the capillary pressure-saturation relationship is
   extended to the calculation of relative permeabilities and the
   prediction of fluid flow in the subsurface, the differences in measured
   and scaled capillary pressure curves lead to differences in the
   predicted flow rates and saturations of the immiscible fluids in the
   subsurface. Thus, care must be used when applying capillary
   pressure-saturation data from one fluid system to that of another, or
   when applying it to different conditions.}},

Abstract = {{We report an experimental study of tracer dispersion in model
   rectangular fractures with rough or smooth walls and with different mean
   apertures. We use an echo dispersion technique in which tracer is first
   injected into the fracture and then pumped back through a detector.
   In a parallel flow regime, echo dispersion combines a geometrical
   mechanism due to the fracture roughness and a Taylor mechanism related
   to the parabolic velocity profile between walls. The latter effect is
   dominant at high velocities and the dispersivity variations with
   velocity allow one to determine the effective aperture of the fracture.
   The low-velocity dispersivity limit that should be related to the
   geometrical characteristics of the roughness was found to be independent
   of the mean fracture thickness for the two models that were studied.
   We show experimentally and numerically that velocity variations in the
   direction perpendicular to the flow lines result in additional
   dispersion resulting from molecular diffusion of the tracer particles
   across the flow lines.}},

Abstract = {{An equation is derived to calculate the specific interfacial area of any
   two continuous immiscible fluids contained in a porous medium. Use of
   the equation requires the volume fraction of fluids, a capillary water
   retention relation and the specific solid surface area of the porous
   medium of interest. Calculations of the air-water interfacial area as a
   function of volumetric water content are presented for a hypothetical
   sand, silt loam and clay soil. These values are compared to those
   calculated from two other equations that have been proposed in the
   literature. The method presented here is novel in that it is based on
   the area of continuous liquid films covering the solid phase matrix and
   so includes both convex and concave curvatures. It also is developed
   such that it converges to the correct known areas at total saturation
   and at monolayer coverage of the solid matrix.}},

Abstract = {{The governing equations describing multiphase flow with multicomponent
   solute transport may be cast in a number of forms. While mathematically
   equivalent, the numerical models based on each formulation differ in
   flexibility and efficiency. The set-iterative compositional formulation,
   a mathematical formulation that separates the solution of the
   phase-balance equations from the species balance is described herein. A
   mathematical model based on this formulation describes the flow of two
   mobile phases. Each phase may transport multiple chemical components.
   Mass exchange between phases is expressed by a linear kinetic equation.
   The numerical model based on the set-iterative compositional formulation
   is shown to model non-equilibrium phase partitioning, to provide a
   flexible framework that may be applied to organic mixtures with
   differing numbers of components and to yield a more efficient solution
   in comparison with models arising from standard compositional
   formulations.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of the movement and biodegradation of quinoline
   was conducted in a saturated, 2-layer system (1 m long) to identify
   processes that may result in increased microbial growth at hydraulic
   layer interfaces. The system contained two layers of contrasting
   hydraulic conductivity (1:12) and flow was parallel to layers. Tracer
   breakthrough, used to quantify interlayer mass transfer, showed that the
   transverse dispersivity was 0.3 cm near the interface and 0.036cm within
   the low-conductivity (low-K) layer. Interlayer mass transfer resulted in
   arrival of substrate (quinoline) and oxygen 10's to 100's of hours
   sooner in the low-K layer near the interface compared to other locations
   within the low-K layer where substrates arrived via only advection.
   Early arrival of substrates near the interface resulted in
   biodegradation of quinoline for a longer period than within layers,
   yielding increased growth in a 1- to 3-cm-thick zone, as measured by
   plate counts. Because biodegradation was oxygen limited in this system,
   microbial growth at all locations was small {[}log(maximum increase)
   less-than-or-equal-to 1.0] and measured porous-medium hydraulic
   properties (dispersion, hydraulic gradient) were not affected by the
   biomass production. Although the thickness of the effected interface
   zone was small in this system, the effect on the overall transport of
   quinoline was significant; 19\% of the growth (and corresponding
   degradation of substrates) in the low-K layer was in the relatively
   small interface zone. The effect of microbial biomass production at
   interfaces on overall solute movement is likely to be maximized in
   environments that have a high density of hydraulic or geochemical
   interfaces, particularly in settings where the interfaces serve as
   mixing zones between nutrient-limited waters.}},

Abstract = {{The biological aerobic degradation of 7 aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene,
   toluene, o-xylene, p-dichlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, naphthalene and
   biphenyl) was studied for 149 days in replicate laboratory batch
   experiments with groundwater and sediment from 8 localities representing
   a 15 m x 30 m section of an aerobic aquifer. Compared to biologically
   deactivated control experiments all compounds were biologically
   degraded. Degradation curves were very reproducible for some compounds
   (benzene, toluene, o-xylene, o-dichlorobenzene and p-dichlorobenzene)
   and less reproducible for other (naphthalene and biphenyl). Based on
   observed length of lag phases, length of the degradation periods and
   percent degradation, the variation among the 8 localities appears to be
   modest. However, detailed examination of the degradation rates revealed
   statistically significant variation among localities for benzene,
   toluene, naphthalene and biphenyl, but not for o-xylene,
   o-dichlorobenzene and p-dichlorobenzene. The maximum variation in
   degradation rates was 15 times in the case of biphenyl. Significant
   co-variation in degradation rates was found between benzene and toluene,
   and between p- and o-dichlorobenzene.}},

Abstract = {{A common method of recharging groundwater is by the use of injection
   wells and/or recharge trenches. With time the recharge capacities of the
   wells/trenches progressively decline. Deposition of suspended fines in
   the recharge water and growth of microorganisms in the aquifer are
   common causes of this decline. This paper presents an investigation of
   the relative significance of these two factors under controlled
   laboratory conditions. Large-scale physical models of recharge trenches
   were constructed in the laboratory to monitor the decline with time of
   the recharge capacity under controlled conditions. The physical models
   consisted of four hydraulically separate cells in which six different
   experiments were conducted. In three of the experiments microorganisms
   were added as an inoculant. A nutrient and carbon fine solution was
   constantly injected into the influent stream entering through the inflow
   pipe. Both carbon fines and microorganisms caused plugging of the model
   recharge trenches in the laboratory. However, initially the microbes
   appeared to have a beneficial effect by hindering the transport of the
   carbon fines from the gravel pack in the trench. Later the microbes
   contributed to the plugging of the gravel pack. A significant
   correlation was determined between the extent of carbon fine deposition
   and microbial growth. In the experiment using a biodegradable slurry,
   microbial growth did not affect the recharge capacity of the trench. One
   laboratory experiment involved the introduction of silt as a source of
   sediment fines to the model recharge trench. This experiment simulated
   conditions often found in the field when no carbon fine adsorption
   system is used and natural surface water is recharged into the aquifer.
   This research will be useful in understanding the relative importance of
   factors contributing to the decline of recharge capacity observed in the
   field.}},

Abstract = {{Field observations indicated that the vertical movement of a selenium
   plume from the pond into the selenium-free groundwater at the Kesterson
   reservoir lags significantly behind the hydrodynamic front. The movement
   of selenium was simulated using DYNAMIX, a redox-controlled, multiple
   species chemical transport model. The actual nature of the retardation
   mechanism, whether it is inorganically controlled or biologically
   controlled, is not yet clearly understood. In the present work, the
   observed retardation is treated equivalently by treating the organic
   layer of pond-bottom sediments as a medium of oxygen consumption. In
   addition, the dissolution of magnetite in the contaminated aquifer was
   treated as a kinetic process. The agreement between the observed and
   computed results suggests that the inorganic process could at least be a
   contributing factor in the retardation of the selenium front. Further
   research is needed to investigate the microbial effect on the movement
   of selenium.}},

Abstract = {{The channeling experiments were designed to study the transmissivity and
   aperture variations in fractures in crystalline rock at a depth
   comparable to high-level waste repository depths. The experiments were
   performed in the Stripa experimental mine in mid-Sweden. Two types of
   experiments were designed. In the single-hole experiments a hole was
   drilled > 2 m into the plane of the fracture and injection flow-rates
   were measured in 5-cm sections using a specially designed injection
   packer. Photographs were also taken inside the hole along the fracture
   to determine the visible fracture aperture and to obtain other
   information such as fracture intersections and fracture infilling. In
   the double-hole experiment two parallel holes were drilled in the plane
   of the same fracture at a center distance of 1.95 m. Hydraulic tests and
   tracer tests were made between the two holes to obtain information on
   connections in the plane of the fracture and to obtain information on
   residence time distributions in different paths (channels).}},

Abstract = {{In this work, recently collected water-level data from the Borden
   aquifer are applied to two recent models to determine whether they
   predict the observed horizontal transverse dispersion observed at the
   aquifer. The collected water-level data are first detrended using a
   combination of ordinary least-squares and generalized least-squares
   methods. The trend surface information shows that the hydraulic head
   gradient is transient. A geostatistical analysis is performed on the
   time series of the components of the hydraulic head gradient to
   determine the variances and integral scales present. Assuming the data
   represent earlier behaviour at the aquifer, the results of the
   geostatistical analysis are combined with those obtained from the
   Stanford Waterloo tracer experiment and the combination used to evaluate
   Rehfeldt's equations for the asymptotic macrodispersivity due to
   unsteady flow conditions. The computed range in asymptotic transverse
   horizontal macrodispersivity is found to be 0.0014 m
   less-than-or-equal-to A22 less-than-or-equal-to 0.054 m. This computed
   range is in good agreement with the measured dispersivity values for the
   Borden aquifer. Spectral analysis is also performed on the component of
   hydraulic head gradient perpendicular to the mean flow direction and
   these results, along with those obtained from the Stanford Waterloo
   tracer experiment, are incorporated into Naff et al.'s moment model to
   predict the horizontal transverse moments at the site. The moments,
   computed using Naff et al.'s model, are found to significantly
   under-predict the observed moments at the site. The analysis shows that
   flow transients contribute to the transverse macrodispersion at the
   Borden site.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the possibilities for removing lead from water by
   reactions involving synthetic hydroxyapatite. Batch experiments show
   that the rate of Pb2+ removal in these reactions is kinetically quite
   rapid. For example, approximately 100 mg L-1 Pb2+ in the starting
   solution are reduced from the solutions to < 0.5 mug L-1 within several
   minutes. The reaction mechanisms are dominated by the dissolution of
   hydroxyapatite and the precipitation of lead apatites, namely
   hydroxypyromorphite and chloropyromorphite, both of which are very
   insoluble over the Ph range of environmental concern. The results show
   that hydroxyapatite is capable of dissolving sufficient phosphate ions
   to promote lead precipitation and thus immobilize the lead from aqueous
   solutions. Further, evidence from the solid analysis shows how the
   morphology of the precipitates affects the reaction kinetics as well as
   the capacity of apatite to remove aqueous lead. For example, in the
   presence of chloride in the Pb2+-hydroxyapatite system, the formation of
   chloropyromorphite on the surface of hydroxyapatite provides an
   effective coating, which inhibits hydroxyapatite dissolution. While the
   potential for controlling lead exists, more work needs to be done to
   characterize the reactions fully. This study confirms the possibilities
   for using mineral apatite or natural phosphate rocks to treat
   lead-contaminated waste water or groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{Two 200-L fixed-bed bioreactors, containing porous-medium material of
   coarse sand and organic carbon (tree bark, wood chips and leaf compost),
   were used to treat NO3 contamination from agricultural runoff. Flow from
   a farm-field drainage tile containing NO3-N concentrations of 3-6 mg L-1
   was successfully treated in the reactors (NO3-N < 0.02 mg L-1) at a rate
   of 10-60 L day-1 over a 1-yr period. Treatment occurs by anaerobic
   denitrification promoted by the added solid-phase organic carbon.
   Because the reactor design is simple, economical to construct and
   maintenance free, it may provide a practical solution to the problem of
   treating redox-sensitive contaminants, such as NO3, in agricultural
   runoff.}},

Abstract = {{In order to study dissolution kinetics of dense non-aqueous-phase
   liquids (DNAPL's), a procedure was developed to create a DNAPL pool at
   the bottom of a specially designed experimental aquifer. The aquifer was
   housed in an all glass rectangular tank with internal dimensions 75 cm x
   21.1 cm x 36.8 cm. The tank was equipped with sampling ports, inlet and
   outlet wells, constant-head reservoirs, and pumps for full hydraulic
   control. The pool was formed inside a 27.9 cm x 18 cm x 4.7 cm internal
   dimensions glass pan containing a gravel layer 1.6 cm thick at the
   bottom and the remainder filled with aquifer sand. The pools formed had
   a distinct, but not perfectly flat upper surface. The fraction of sand
   penetrated by DNAPL was larger at elevations closer to the bottom of the
   tank. Dissolution experiments, using TCA and mixture of TCE and TCA
   pools, resulted in aqueous concentrations much lower than the respective
   solubility. Pulsed pumping increased the respective aqueous
   concentrations by a factor of approximately 6.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous-flow column experiments with short-pulse inputs of one
   hydrophobic and one hydrophilic bacterium were used to study the
   retention of bacteria on quartz (negatively charged), hematite-coated
   quartz (positively charged) and polymer-coated quartz (hydrophobic
   surface), at pH 7.3. Both bacteria were Gram-negative rods. All
   breakthrough peaks occurred about one pore volume after the input pulse,
   and were attenuated compared to a bromide-tracer peak. Maximum bacteria
   concentrations in the column outlet were 0.08-57\% of the peak bromide
   concentration. A one-dimensional advection-dispersion transport model
   with first-order bacteria removal described by colloid-filtration theory
   was used to estimate attachment and detachment rate coefficients and the
   relative sticking efficiency (cu) of bacteria in each experiment.
   Attachment was reversible, with rate coefficients for attachment on the
   order of 10(-4)-10(-3) s(-1), implying that the time scale for
   attachment was of the same order as the column detention time of 1.2 h.
   The time scale for detachment was on the order of days to weeks. This
   slow detachment could be important in deep subsurface environments where
   transport on geologic time scales is important, and in some shallow
   aquifer recharge situations where soils are used to eliminate pathogenic
   bacteria from sewage effluent. Values for cu were 0.04-0.4. Slower
   attachment and detachment rates were observed for the hydrophilic vs.
   hydrophobic bacteria, suggesting that hydrophilic bacteria could move
   further before being removed by attachment to soil, but once attached,
   would be resuspended at a slower rate.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution of industrial creosote with water was investigated using
   a small physical model (generator column) in the laboratory. The column
   was packed with a creosote residual of 10\% and the effluent was
   monitored for ten target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's)
   including naphthalene, phenanthrene and benzo{[}a]pyrene. Tests were
   also conducted with variable contact time to evaluate mass-transfer
   rates and the rare of approach to equilibrium dissolution. For most
   components equilibrium between creosote and water was attained after a
   contact time of 60 h. During shorter contact periods, lower aqueous
   concentrations of PAH's were attained. However, the ratios of these
   concentrations were in proportion to their effective solubilities which
   were calculated using Raoult's law and the creosote compositional data.
   Comparison of the laboratory data with results from an equilibrium model
   indicated that creosote dissolution could not be described by
   equilibrium relationships between component concentrations in the two
   phases at the experimental groundwater velocities. As well as the
   equilibrium model, a kinetic model was used in an attempt to simulate
   the flushout data. It is suggested that increasing mass-transfer rate
   limitations between the two phases and within the non-aqueous-phase
   liquid (NAPL) as dissolution proceeded accounted for the differences
   between the kinetic model and experimental results. Both the physical
   and mathematical models showed that the dissolution of creosote dense
   non-aqueous-phase liquid (DNAPL) would initially result in high
   concentrations of components having high effective solubilities.
   Complete depletion of creosote by dissolution alone, assuming
   equilibrium, would require a water/creosote volume ratio of > 270,000.
   Therefore, water flushing as a remedial measure will be relatively
   ineffective for removing residual creosote. The properties of creosote
   and the aqueous phase, time of contact between the two phases, the
   degree of contact and the groundwater velocity are important factors in
   controlling mass transfer between the two phases.}},

   aquifer recharged by the Drac River (Grenoble, France) is characterized

   However, small zones (of enhanced biological activity due to low

Abstract = {{A description is provided of an above-ground, weighing lysimeter that
   minimizes the edge flow of water which can occur between the soil and
   the wall of the casing. The lysimeter was designed to study water flux
   and the movement of inorganic and/or organic pollutants as they pass
   through and beyond the root zone. The lysimeter is instrumented at
   selected depths with thermistors, soil solution extractors, time-domain
   reflectometry probes, gas extractors and tensiometers. These sensors
   provide temperature measurements, soil solution samples, water content
   measurements, soil atmosphere samples and water potential measurements.
   The horizontal insertion of these instruments from the side of the
   lysimeter reduces any channeling that might occur along the sides of the
   instruments, if they had been inserted vertically. Annular-ring baffles
   are located at selected depths to reduce edge flow between the lysimeter
   casing and the column of soil. The baffles redirect water flow away from
   the edge of the column. Data an presented that show a reduction in the
   hydraulic bypass of the lysimeter compared to a lysimeter without
   baffles. The total cost of a single lysimeter including materials and
   labor is under US \$4000.}},

Abstract = {{A new model to describe flow and transport in fractured rocks is
   proposed. It is based on the concept of a network of channels. The
   individual channel members are given stochastically selected
   conductances and volumes. Flow-rate calculations have been performed.
   For large standard deviations in conductances, channeling becomes
   pronounced with most of the water flowing in a few paths. The effluent
   patterns and flow-rate distributions obtained in the simulations have
   been compared to three field measurements in drifts and tunnels of
   flow-rate distributions. Standard deviations of channel conductances
   were between 1.6 and greater than or equal to 2.4 in some cases. A
   particle-following technique was used to simulate solute transport in
   the network. Non-sorbing as well as sorbing solute transport can be
   simulated. By using a special technique, solutes that diffuse into the
   rock matrix can also be simulated.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a study on the hydrodynamic dispersion of ionic solutes
   in unsaturated porous media are presented. This study concerns the
   description of solute transport in moving coordinates, the application
   of the radiometric method to measure the water content and solute
   density in unsaturated soil, the verification of the theory of solute
   transport in the aeration zone. The application of moving coordinates
   has permitted the elimination of the convection term from the transport
   equation, which leads to more simple numerical procedures. This is due
   to the absence of the so-called numerical dispersion, which is present
   in the classic approach and brings about substantial errors. The
   radiometric method of monitoring has allowed to simultaneously measure
   the distribution of water content and solute density in the undisturbed
   soil sample. The experimental results have shown a linear relationship
   between the coefficient of dispersion and pore-water velocity for a
   given water content, and a linear dependence of the dispersion
   coefficient on the water content for a constant pore-water velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Breakthrough curves of Cs-137 and tritiated water injected
   instantaneously into artificial fractures in Lac du Bonnet granite were
   analyzed using the analytical solution for a single rock-fracture system
   and assuming the linear sorption isotherm of the solute. Parameters of
   nuclide diffusion and sorption in rock matrices, obtained by fitting,
   varied depending on the flow velocity in the fractures. According to
   theoretical calculations, different fracture flow velocities lead to
   different diffusion distances of nuclides in matrices at the same
   injection volume. As microscopic inhomogeneity is considered to exist in
   the rock matrix, the average diffusion-sorption characteristics of the
   matrix within the diffusion distance may have varied with the fracture
   flow velocity. Surface sorption was marked in fractures that had
   relatively high matrix sorption-diffusion capacities. The phenomenon was
   interpreted using the theoretical relationships developed between the
   surface sorption, matrix sorption and pore diffusion coefficient, and
   the porosity of matrices.
   The effect of the nonlinear sorption of solute was examined by
   numerically solving model equations that incorporate the nonlinear
   isotherm. This incorporation may contribute to the reduction of
   deviations between theoretical and experimental BTC's.}},

Abstract = {{Several factors may enhance the mobility of metals in an aquifer. Metals
   in such systems may associate with inorganic or organic ligands that
   affect retardation or with mobile colloids which may provide a faster
   transport mechanism. Complexation and/or sorption of a fraction of the
   metal may result in mobility in excess of that predicted using a single
   equilibrium based distribution coefficient which was derived from a more
   simple system. Failure to predict enhanced contaminant mobility may
   result in false predictions of arrival times and concentrations, and
   underestimation of human exposure to a contaminant. In this paper the
   results of a series of laboratory column studies designed to investigate
   factors influencing enhanced mobility of metals (Cd, Cu, Cr and Pb) in
   an aquifer are presented.
   The first of two peaks in effluent metal concentration resulting from a
   pulse input of metal waste to an aquifer material packed column was
   observed to coincide with a peak in effluent turbidity. SEM/EDX analysis
   showed metals to be sorbed to the surface of the turbidity causing
   colloids. These observations indicated association with mobile colloids
   may facilitate the transport of metals through soil packed columns. The
   mobilization and/or transport of colloids was apparently influenced by
   alterations in eluent chemistry, such as pH and ionic strength.
   The results also indicated complexation can enhance Pb mobility. Greater
   sensitivity of mobility to alterations in groundwater chemistry was
   observed for Pb and Cr than for Cd and Cu.}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of a Freundlich-type isotherm, the
   Sheindorf-Rebuhn-Sheintuch (SRS) equation, to represent the competitive
   adsorption of Sr, Cs and Co in Ca-montmorillonite suspensions was
   investigated. Experimental adsorption data were obtained for systems
   containing these cations as single-component, binary and ternary
   mixtures. The competition coefficients alpha(ij), which were obtained
   based on the experimental adsorption data for bicomponent systems, can
   be viewed as a way to quantify competitive interactions. The competition
   coefficients obtained for the cations under consideration indicate that
   their competitive interactions are of similar magnitude, with the cation
   least affected by competitive effects being Cs, while the adsorption of
   Co was more significantly affected by the presence of Cs, and Sr by the
   presence of Co. After alpha(ij)-values were substituted in the SRS
   equation, the adsorption of systems of three or more components could be
   predicted. To validate the SRS equation, the adsorption values predicted
   by this equation for the ternary mixture Sr-Cs-Co were compared to
   values determined experimentally. The SRS equation successfully modeled
   adsorption for the range of concentrations that followed Freundlich
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of trace concentrations (similar to 1 mg L(-1)) of
   monoaromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes -
   BTEX) and a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon (tetrachloroethene - PCE)
   in groundwater were studied in large-scale columns containing
   uncontaminated sands and groundwater from a major Quaternary aquifer
   beneath an urban area on the Swan Coastal Plain of Western Australia.
   Columns were run in saturated mode with and without nitrate addition.
   Results from these experiments indicate that indigenous microorganisms
   in uncontaminated aquifer material are capable of degrading trace
   amounts of toluene and ethylbenzene under denitrifying conditions and
   toluene under sulfate-reducing conditions. Benzene was persistent under
   anoxic conditions, but degraded readily under oxygenated conditions. PCE
   did not degrade under either oxic or anoxic conditions in these tests.
   First-order degradation rates fitted from a one-dimensional model were
   estimated as > 1.1.10(-4) s(-1) for benzene under oxic conditions, (4
   +/- 2).10(-5) s(-1) for toluene under anoxic conditions (denitrifying
   and sulfate-reducing conditions) and (4 +/- 3).10-5 s(-1) for
   ethylbenzene under denitrifying conditions. Degradation rates tended to
   increase with time (over a 150-day period), suggesting that bacteria
   became more efficient at degrading toluene and possibly other aromatic
   compounds with increasing exposure. Total bacteria counts and numbers of
   denitrifying bacteria were highest where toluene degradation was taking
   place close to the influent of the columns. The rates of loss of toluene
   were similar under denitrifying and sulfate-reducing conditions for
   different soils.}},

Abstract = {{Field and microcosm observations of methanogenic phenolic compound
   degradation indicate that Monod kinetics governs the substrate
   disappearance but overestimates the observed biomass. In this paper we
   present modeling results from an ongoing multidisciplinary study of
   methanogenic biodegradation of phenolic compounds in a sand and gravel
   aquifer contaminated by chemicals and wastes used in wood treatment.
   Field disappearance rates of four phenols match those determined in
   batch microcosm studies previously performed by E.M. Godsy and
   coworkers. The degradation process appears to be at steady-state because
   even after a sustained influx over several decades, the contaminants
   still are disappearing in transport downgradient. The existence of a
   steady-state degradation profile of each substrate together with a low
   biomass density in the aquifer indicate that the bacteria population is
   exhibiting no net growth. This may be due to the oligotrophic nature of
   the biomass population in which utilization and growth are approximately
   independent of concentration for most of the concentration range. Thus a
   constant growth rate should exist over much of the contaminated area
   which may in turn be balanced by an unusually high decay or maintenance
   rate due to hostile conditions or predation.}},

Abstract = {{In a single-grained and extremely sandy (98\% sand) soil asymmetrical
   breakthrough curves (BTC's) of simazine, with earlier breakthrough and a
   delayed approach to equilibrium relative concentration (generally
   referred as tailing) were obtained at varying pore-water velocities
   using laboratory columns. These BTC's were successfully described only
   when the bicontinuum approach of two sites/two regions was used with the
   convective dispersive equation. The models using this approach need two
   additional parameters (namely fraction of type-1 sites or mobile phase
   f, and the rate parameter for type-2 sites or immobile phase alpha) and
   these are generally obtained by curve-fitting procedures. However,
   considering the importance of independent measurement of input
   parameters for the numerical simulation of these BTC's. the rate
   parameters describing the time-dependent behaviour of simazine sorption
   were sought from a separate experiment performed under realistic (flow
   instead of batch) conditions. In this experiment sorption values were
   calculated from retardation factors of pulse BTC's as affected by
   pore-water velocities. The sorption of simazine under flow conditions
   was found to be much slower than occurs under the shaking employed in
   the batch method. Furthermore it followed a linear relation with square
   root of time. The sorption vs. square root time relation provided one of
   the two parameters (the fraction of type-1 sites) needed for simulation.
   Consistent with numerous reports in the literature, the rate parameter
   for type-2 sites (or mass-transfer coefficient for immobile region
   alpha) was found to be dependent on pore-water velocity. Furthermore,
   the fraction of type-1 sites (or fraction of mobile phase) was also
   found to vary with pore-water velocity, which has not commonly been
   observed. Since the organic matter in the soil used here was the
   predominant source of sorption sites, intra-organic matter diffusion may
   have been the most likely cause of nonequilibrium conditions during
   simazine transport. The independent measurement of the rate parameter
   alpha could not be accomplished. However, the alpha value from this
   study as well as those from a number of published studies were found to
   have essentially similar relationship with pore-water velocity.}},

Abstract = {{A sediment mixing approach was taken to systematically vary the organic
   carbon (oc) and clay content (cm) of a suite of organic-poor, clay-rich
   sediments. Organic carbon content ranged from 3.2\% to 0.4\% and clay
   content ranged from 24\% to 51\%. Atrazine and alachlor were shown to
   sorb to both natural organic carbon and clay minerals. Partition
   coefficients to natural organic carbon (K(oc)) were found to be 217 and
   412 L/kg organic carbon for atrazine and alachlor, respectively.
   Partition coefficients to the clay fraction were found to be 3.5 and 4.9
   L/kg clay for atrazine and alachlor, respectively. When expressed in
   terms of surface area, the partition coefficients to clay for atrazine
   and alachlor were 1.80.10(-5) and 2.51.10(-5) L/m2 clay, respectively.
   Critical cm/oc ratios at which mineral phase sorption accounts for 50\%
   of the total are defined. Implications for the modelling of herbicide
   movement in the subsurface if mineral phase sorption is ignored is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A 1.0-ha cotton field in Nantong city (Jiangsu province, P.R.C.) was
   selected to monitor the movement and fate of aldicarb residues in soil
   and to check whether it will pollute the groundwater. The field
   measurement results showed that > 90\% of the total aldicarb applied had
   been dissipated within 60 days and no detectable level of aldicarb
   residues was found in any of the soil profiles 120 days after the
   aldicarb was applied. The maximum leaching depth of aldicarb in soil was
   0.60 m. None of the 20 observation wells in and around the study site
   had any detectable aldicarb residues during the entire experimental
   period. The PRZM model was used to simulate the movement of aldicarb in
   soil using the input data including soil properties, meteorological data
   and agriculture practices at the study site. Results predicted by the
   PRZM model agreed fairly well with those of the field measurements.
   Under the conditions of this experiment, the application of aldicarb to
   the cotton fields did not result in groundwater contamination. The
   results suggest that the PRZM model can be used to estimate the
   possibility of aldicarb leaching into groundwater and its effects on
   groundwater in other areas of China that have similar soil properties.}},

Abstract = {{Orthophosphate transport behaviour was studied in laboratory experiments
   by continuously injecting KH2PO4-contaminated groundwater into columns
   filled with aquifer sand. Sorption parameters for the application of the
   kinetic two-site Langmuir equation were derived from batch experiments.
   The phosphate breakthrough curves of the column experiments were
   simulated with a transport model based on a numerical approximation of
   the one-dimensional transport equation. The processes of sorption were
   included in the model using the two-site Langmuir isotherm with
   first-order kinetics. The breakthrough curves indicated precipitation
   processes occur in the columns. The equilibration of the tracer solution
   with aluminium phosphate (variscite) was calculated using the
   thermodynamic model program PHREEQE. The simulation of mineral
   equilibration and sorption allows differentiation of retention phenomena
   at the sediment-water interface and the prediction of orthophosphate
   transport in soil-water systems under various geochemical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The method of lumped parameter models in the field of isotope
   hydrogeology mainly includes the investigation of the age structure of
   the groundwater in the aquifer concerned. Results of such applications
   can be used in the simulation of mass transport or for the assessment of
   groundwater vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution. Commonly, such
   investigations are based on data of environmental isotopes (e.g., H-3,
   C-14,  Ar-39, Kr-85) or other tracers. In this context, the lumped
   parameter models do not make any assumptions concerning specific
   pollutants, but their advantage over discrete numeric simulation
   approaches is that they need relatively few parameters. In some
   circumstances, the combination of several lumped parameter models
   permits a better approximation of the real situation by the model
   assumptions. However, the additional parameters required are often
   unknown. The user-friendly computer program presented in this paper
   allows the selection from more than 30 model combinations and calculates
   up to two free model parameters as well as further quantities related to
   the vulnerability. It has several functions for pre-processing and
   post-processing. In the example of application, some of the program
   features and possibilities are presented.}},

Abstract = {{In selected subareas of the city of Munich concentrations of H-2, H-3,

   hydrochemical data including concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons
   (CHC) were measured from groundwaters of approximately 58 wells tapping
   the shallow (Quaternary) and the deep (Tertiary) aquifer. The results
   obtained show that under hydraulic stress young tritium-containing
   groundwaters in general have penetrated down to depths of as much as
   approximately 60 m. The groundwater model ages decrease from recent
   values in the Quaternary aquifer to approximately 15 kyr at a depth of
   approximately 200 m in the Tertiary aquifer. CHC, Cl-, NO3- and SO42- 
   were detected in some places in comparable depths to tritium. The
   results show clearly that it is necessary to introduce measures for the
   protection of the deep groundwater against pollution: Consumption should
   be limited to < 10(7) m3 yr-1 and the deep groundwater should only be
   used for purposes which require drinking water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of pH and hydrophobicity on attachment and detachment of PRD-1
   and MS-2 in three different sandy soils were investigated in a series of
   laboratory-column experiments. Concentrations of the lipid-containing
   phage PRD-1 decreased 3-4 orders of magnitude during passage through the
   10-1 5-cm-long columns. Attachment of the lipid-containing phage PRD-1
   was insensitive to pH and was apparently controlled by hydrophobic
   interactions in soil media. The less-hydrophobic phage MS-2 acted
   conservatively; it was not removed in the columns at pH's 5.7-8.0. The
   sticking efficiency (alpha) in a colloid-filtration model was between
   0.1 and 1 for PRD-1, indicating a relatively high removal efficiency.
   Phage attachment was reversible, but detachment under steady-state
   conditions was slow. An increase in pH had a moderate effect on
   enhancing detachment. Still, these soils should continue to release
   phage to virus-free water for days to weeks following exposure to
   virus-containing water. In sandy soils with a mass-fraction organic
   carbon as low as a few hundredths of a percent, pH changes in the range
   5.7-8.0 should have little effect on retention of more-hydrophobic virus
   (e.g., PRD-1), in that retardation will be dominated by hydrophobic
   effects. Sharp increases in pH should enhance detachment and transport
   of virus previously deposited on soil grains. A more hydrophilic virus
   (e.g., MS-2) will transport as a conservative tracer in low-carbon sandy
   soil.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation of ferric oxyhydroxide is defined as loss of ferric iron
   from solution and includes any or all of the following processes:
   formation of small precursor polymers, growth of these polymers to
   colloidal particles and subsequent condensation to a settleable
   precipitate. The precipitation kinetics is reported for simple ferric
   chloride solutions. The kinetics are described by an initial slow
   nucleation rate followed by a more rapid crystallite growth rate. Both
   rates are first order in the calculated concentration of aqueous
   Fe(OH)30 and are consistent with a kinetic model in which precipitation
   of the ferric solid from Fe(OH)30 is the rate-controlling step.
   Crystallite growth rates are retarded by the presence of Fe3+ (and to a
   lesser extent, FeOH2+). This effect is due to the adsorption of Fe3+
   onto active surface sites or by the incorporation of Fe3+ into the
   structure of the precipitating solid resulting in a solid solution. This
   mechanism is proposed as a possible cause of the mixed stoichiometry and
   poorly crystalline form of fresh ferric oxyhydroxide precipitates
   observed in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Model predictions are uncertain because of uncertainties on future
   and/or anthropogenic stresses, parameter values and conceptual models.
   The first two groups of problems can be addressed through rather
   systematic methods (scenario analysis, error transmission techniques,
   automatic calibration algorithms, etc.). However, conceptual
   uncertainties are rarely given adequate attention. The objective of this
   paper is to synthesize conceptual difficulties associated with
   transport. These include: (1) processes that are significant at small
   scales may not be relevant at large scales; (2) inversely, new processes
   (e.g., dispersion) emerge in response to increase in scale and the way
   to represent them may depend on the assumed model structure; (3) the
   observed shapes of both breakthrough curves and pollutant plumes are not
   well represented by the classical transport equation; (4) porosities and
   dispersivities derived from field tracer tests often exhibit a
   directional dependence; etc. Though not directly related to solute
   transport, scale effects on hydraulic conductivity may also affect
   solute transport modelling. When these anomalies are examined, it is
   concluded that they are directly or indirectly caused by heterogeneity.
   Current approaches for dealing with heterogeneity can be divided into
   stochastic and deterministic. Stochastic methods have been successful in
   explaining qualitatively some anomalies of solute transport, but they
   appear to be far from reaching a stage at which they can be used
   routinely for solving realistic field problems. On the other hand, when
   applied with care, deterministic methods have been successfully used in
   actual problems. Yet, it can be argued that they fail to account for
   small-scale variability of concentrations so that they would become
   ineffective when dealing with nonlinear processes, such as chemical
   reactions. Relevance of on-going research for overcoming these
   difficulties is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Radionuclides which migrate from a repository for nuclear waste in
   crystalline rock are transported by the water in a very complex fracture
   network. One of the main retardation mechanisms is that of uptake by
   diffusion and sorption in the rock matrix. The uptake is strongly
   influenced by the size of the contact surface between the mobile water
   and the rock. It is also strongly influenced by the residence time
   distribution of the water in contact with these surfaces.
   In recent years, several large-scale field experiments and observations
   have been made that show strong channeling effects. A considerable
   fraction of the water may flow in preferential pathways without good
   mixing with the rest of the water. This leads to the question if the
   traditional advection-dispersion-based equations are sufficient to
   describe the transport.
   In this paper the advection-dispersion model is compared with a pure
   channeling model where the different channels have different flow-rates.
   In the channeling model no mixing between the waters in the channels
   takes place. In the advection-dispersion model there is very frequent
   mixing. These two models would seem to form the two extremes of the
   properties of fracture network or channel network models. A recently
   developed channel network model where the individual channel members
   form a three-dimensional network is also used to simulate tracer
   transport. The channel network model has stochastically varying
   conductivities of the different channel members. The channel network can
   be thought of as connecting the channels in the channeling model and
   allowing the waters to mix along the flow paths.
   In all models the magnitude of the flow-wetted surface has a very strong
   impact on the arrival times for sorbing species. The time to attain a
   certain concentration at a point is proportional to the magnitude of the
   flow-wetted surface squared. Considering that the flow-wetted surface in
   rock is one of the entities which is poorly known and is difficult to
   assess, this suggests that there is a need for more field data and for
   methods to assess this entity.
   The three models need different types of data. All need the magnitude of
   the flow-wetted surface. The channeling and channeling network models
   need the conductivity distribution of the channels and channel members
   respectively. These data can be obtained by hydraulic tests, The
   advection-dispersion model needs some measure of the dispersivity. This
   information could be obtained by tracer tests using nonsorbing tracers.
   It is shown in the paper that if the hydraulic system in the rock is
   best described by a channel network then the use of the
   advection-dispersion model can give ambiguous results when used to
   predict transport of sorbing tracers.}},

Abstract = {{A series of laboratory tracer migration experiments in a single rock
   fracture have been performed, and the breakthrough curves have been
   interpreted using mathematical modelling. Discrepancies were observed
   between the experimental data and the predictions made using a simple
   advection-dispersion model. The potential reasons for these
   discrepancies have been investigated by applying more complex models:
   one model incorporates channelling of flow within the fracture, the
   other couples dispersion and advection in the fracture with rock-matrix
   diffusion. It is concluded that channelling of flow can adequately
   explain the observed spreading behaviour; rock-matrix diffusion is not a
   significant mechanism influencing transport in these experiments.}},

Abstract = {{A dual-porosity chemical transport model is applied to saturated
   fractured porous media. In this model, transport through fractures is
   advection-dominated while transport within the matrix and between the
   matrix and the fractures is diffusion-dominated. Recent studies in the
   literature indicate that conservative tracers and radionuclides in these
   systems will be retarded by matrix diffusion even in the absence of
   chemical reactions. This study examines systems that include chemical
   reactions (e.g., dissolution/precipitation and aqueous complexation) and
   examines changes in retardation caused by precipitation.
   The two-dimensional simulation domain consists of a single fracture and
   the adjacent permeable matrix. The system is modeled using finite
   differences and a chemical equilibrium simulator based cn the
   Villars-Cruise-Smith algorithm. A constant flow rate is assumed in the
   fracture, and diffusion rates are functions of the local matrix
   porosity.
   Results from simulations with idealized chemistry are presented and
   discussed to illustrate basic characteristics of this system. These
   characteristics include both advection-induced and diffusion-induced
   sequential dissolution/precipitation waves. Results are contrasted with
   limiting single porosity cases. An additional simulation using the
   Pitzer activity coefficient model illustrates the chemical retardation
   of a contaminant due to contaminant precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{Coupling geochemistry and transport appears unavoidable since it is rare
   that either of these two phenomena alone can account for the movement of
   solutes in groundwater. The chemical model is based on thermodynamic
   equilibrium. The method used is a Gibbs free energy minimization
   constrained by mass balances. The model calculates the aqueous
   speciation, the precipitation and the dissolution of pure minerals or
   solid solutions. The transport equation is solved by the random walk
   technique which avoids the problem of numerical dispersion for
   transport, but may be more time consuming than finite differences or
   elements if a large number of particles are necessary in order to get a
   sufficiently `'smooth'' solution. However, when the chemistry deals with
   a realistic number of elements (e.g., > 10), the cost of the chemistry
   computation largely dominates that of transport. Special techniques had
   to be developed in order to solve problems linked to the conditions
   present in some of the CEC CHEMVAL tests (boundary with fixed
   concentrations and very low Peclet numbers). The coupling consists of
   calculating the exchanges of chemical elements betweeen two populations.
   The first population is sedentary, constituted by a mesh of fixed cells
   representing the composition of the solid phase. The other population is
   nomadic, represented by a set of particles which are advected by
   groundwater flow. A vector of real numbers is associated with each
   mobile particle. This vector accounts for the mass of each element
   dissolved in the moving liquid phase. For this reason, the transport
   equation is only solved once for the whole set of elements. The main
   assumptions that were necessary to perform the coupling in a simple way
   are discussed. Two applications are presented: (1) a verification
   compared to an analytical solution; and (2) the simulation of a
   percolation experiment through a sandstone core.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption of radionuclides on fracture surfaces is strongly dependent
   upon the chemical properties of both the surface and the groundwater.
   Normally, it is assumed that some kind of mean properties may be used in
   simulations. Since the mineral distribution in real rock is strongly
   heterogeneous, the sorption is switched on and off while the groundwater
   propagates through a fracture system.
   The CRACKER program, which models the rock as a random distribution of
   minerals, has been used to study effects of heterogeneity. In the model
   simulations, retardation due to homogeneous sorption has been compared
   with that caused by heterogeneous sorption. Contaminated groundwater
   step inputs have been followed through fractures in one- and
   two-dimensional simulations.
   The model results indicate that the heterogeneous distribution of rock
   minerals may influence the migration of radionuclides in a fracture
   system. In the model considered, mineral-groundwater reactions cause
   local Ph and Pe to deviate from the mean values. Thus sorption is also
   influenced. Further, `'chemical channelling'' may result in a rapid
   propagation of radionuclides in fractures.}},

   at assessing the relevance of colloid-facilitated transport to
   repository safety analyses, with specific reference to the Swiss case.
   Transport models are presented, developed in conjunction with field- and
   laboratory-based studies of deep groundwater in the crystalline basement
   of northern Switzerland, in which colloid size distributions,
   composition and sorption properties have been measured. Various
   potential mechanisms giving rise to both reversible and irreversible
   sorption are discussed. In the first case, a simple approach is examined
   which is based on previously reported models of colloid transport and
   assumes reversible, linear sorption on colloids, for which experimental
   data have been obtained. It is shown that transport of radionuclides
   would not, in general, be significantly enhanced because of this
   process. A more recently developed and more complex model is then
   described incorporating irreversible sorption, in which case the
   transport of radionuclides tends to be strongly dependent on the extent
   of colloid-fracture wall interaction,}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to make calculations for radionuclide
   dispersal in the presence of colloids, extending the cases previously
   calculated for the geosphere in the absence of colloids.
   The analysis is based on theoretical considerations, presenting a
   unified approach to dispersal from the scale of individual colloids up
   to that of geosphere breakthrough problems. A feature is the bridging of
   the gap between the standard continuum models of macroscopic transport
   and the considerations of colloid science, where colloids and complexes
   are subject to microscopic experimental analysis.
   In the radionuclide-colloid analysis it is shown that breakthrough
   curves could be both enhanced and retarded by the presence of colloids,
   according to the levels assumed for sorption to free and immobile
   colloid material. Within a fracture, such enhancement is limited above
   by a 30\% faster average breakthrough, although since there is also
   exclusion of the colloid-bound radionuclides from the surrounding
   saturated rock matrix it is important to consider the reduction of the
   matrix retardation applicable to the solute.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model of radiocesium transfer in a lake and its catchment
   is presented in an attempt to improve previous approaches. The
   experimental data base of the Esthwaite Water location, U.K., prepared
   in the international program on Validation of Model Predictions (VAMP)
   of IAEA/CEC, was used as a test scenario. Radiocesium enters the lake
   via: (1) a quick pulse of atmospheric deposition for 1-2 days; and (2) a
   lasting but smaller contribution from the catchment carried by the water
   runoff and the dragged sediments. An auxiliary model of the catchment
   was used to quantify these two source terms.
   The temporal evolution of the Cs-137 concentration in this lake after
   the contamination by the Chernobyl accident is modelled using a
   compartmental approach following the Codell model. The
   desorption/adsorption dynamics between water and sediments are
   considered both in the drainage water and in the lake boundary layer.
   The most important processes transferring contamination out of the lake
   water are adsorption of radioactivity by suspended sediments and their
   sedimentation; these processes are modelled through a distribution
   coefficient and through an aerial removal rate. Summer stratification is
   modelled introducing some auxiliary hypotheses.
   When using a priori probability distributions for the parameters based
   both on experimental evidence and on information from the literature the
   model simulates the observed radiocesium concentrations with an expected
   underprediction bias of 30\% in the integrated concentrations in water.
   The concentration in sediments is inside the observed range in most of
   the runs. After the calibration of the model to the best fits observed
   with parameters inside their expected ranges, the bias decreases to -6\%
   in the epilimnion, 8\% in the hypolimnion and -4.4\% in sediments, with
   an unexplained variance of +3.2\%, +3\% and +1\%, respectively.}},

   mechanism is included in a flow model taking into account dispersion and
   advection. The transport model is validated by column experiments
   performed with sand from Gue, France. The model allows the prediction of
   strontium transport in a wide concentration range. Strontium retardation
   is mainly governed by strontianite precipitation and Ca/Sr exchange. The
   ability of the driving water to dissolve the precipitated strontianite
   can be responsible for an overconcentrated strontium peak, and

   failure to distinguish between sorption and precipitation - processes
   which are treated quite differently in transport models. Natural
   analogue studies can be used to test radionuclide migration models and
   their associated databases, but considerable efforts are required to
   adequately characterise the geochemical process occurring. Without such
   extensive studies, the general applicability of data produced is limited
   and claims to derive parameters usable in repository performance
   assessment should be treated with considerable caution.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium is often considered to be a mobile radioelement in the natural
   environment owing to its tendency to form stable complexes with a number
   of aqueous anions, particularly in oxidising milieu. A series of
   infiltration experiments were devised to investigate this migration
   behaviour under rigidly controlled laboratory conditions. Intact cores
   of Permo-Triassic Clashach Sandstone were pre-equilibrated with
   synthetic groundwater solutions and continuous flow-through of uranium
   monitored together with Ph and concentrations of other ions.
   Prior to performing each experiment a simulation was carried out using a
   one-dimensional coupled chemical transport code, encompassing a
   thermodynamic description of the electrical double layer. These
   calculations together with electron microscopy indicated the potential
   role played by iron oxyhydroxide grain coatings in retarding the uranium
   plume. Thus, a second series of experiments was initiated on
   pre-acidified cores from which all surface exposed iron had been
   removed, allowing an assessment of the retention capacity of non-ferric
   components.
   Taken together, the data clearly illustrate the strong affinity of
   aqueous uranium species for natural surfaces even under strongly
   oxidising conditions. The success of the model in predicting a priori
   the dominant trends in uranium migration behaviour is encouraging and
   may aid in prioritising analytical requirements for investigations in
   more complex geochemical situations than those studied here.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium is being actively transported from uraniferous sedimentary rocks
   into a peat bog at the Broubster natural analogue site in Caithness,
   Scotland. Massive calcareous sandstone within the Caithness Flags
   sequence is the main source of uranium which resides primarily within
   diagenetic apatite and dispersed U-Si-Ti phases. Supergene weathering
   processes have decalcified the sandstone and are effective in mobilising
   uranium by groundwater leaching, primarily along a fault zone. Uranium
   transport in solution by means of groundwater and surface flows is
   effectively terminated by retardation within 4-kyr-old peat deposits
   laid down on boulder clay. This process of secondary fixation has
   resulted in a young-uranium anomaly in the peat which comprises in
   excess of 0.1 wt\% U. The site has been investigated comprehensively to
   define the geometry of the anomaly together with the hydrogeology,
   hydrochemistry, petrology, mineralogy and the nature of the peat
   sink-term. The main physical and geochemical properties of the system,
   including the uranium decay series radionuclide distributions in water
   and solid samples, are documented in this paper. From these data, the
   processes governing the distribution of uranium have been quantified
   using a three-dimensional groundwater flow package and an equilibrium
   speciation model incorporating a recently developed electrostatic
   surface complexation model to account for cation-organic interactions.
   The results described form part of a coordinated project on natural
   radionuclide migration undertaken to improve confidence in predictive
   methods used for radiological assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Alkaline thermal waters were sampled in granitic areas of southern
   Europe. In this study attention is focused on the behaviour of trace
   elements likely to be present in a radioactive waste disposal. We
   demonstrate that, in this type of waters: (1) most transition metals are
   limited to very low concentrations probably by sulfide minerals (CoS,
   MoS3, ZnS, Sb2S3); (2) uranium is limited in solution by uraninite; (3)
   for tri- and tetravalent metals such as Zr, Hf, etc., and rare-earth
   elements (REE), we observe that they are well correlated with Th, with a
   slope of 1 in log-log diagrams. These elements are associated with
   particles suspended in solution. The different Th to REE or Th to Zr,
   Hf, etc., ratios are constant in solution and in the particulate
   fraction.}},

   thirteen primary and alteration minerals. An empirical sorption equation
   has been developed to address the geochemical variability in an
   intrusive rock formation. To allow sorption data obtained on
   unconsolidated material to be used in transport calculations through
   intact rock, differences in the surface areas and, hence, sorptive
   capacities of the two types of material are recognized by incorporating
   a surface area term that is a function of porosity. This provides a more
   conservative and more defensible assessment of radionuclide transport
   through consolidated geological material.}},

Abstract = {{The migration of groundwater equilibrated with cement from a deep
   geological disposal facility for radioactive wastes will perturb the
   chemical, mineralogical and physical properties of the geosphere in
   advance of the migration of radionuclides. Preliminary modelling of a
   simplified scenario has been conducted to assess these changes using
   appropriate data for mineral dissolution kinetics, the chemical
   composition of cement pore fluids, and the hydrogeological
   characteristics of fractured crystalline rock. Chemical exchanges
   between rock immediately adjacent to the engineered barriers of a waste
   disposal facility and pore fluids were evaluated using the
   speciation-reaction path code, EQ316, which revealed a rapid loss of Ca,
   and gains in Na and Si of the evolved fluids, with little change in Ph.
   Secondary minerals show a sequence of calcium silicate hydrates, and
   zeolites. Precise definition of the overall mass balance is uncertain
   due to the absence of both thermodynamic data for many zeolites and
   kinetic data for the precipitation of feldspars. Modelling has
   demonstrated that reaction kinetics will be important in governing
   chemical exchanges for length scales up to 20 m. Radionuclide
   retardation will be enhanced by the growth of zeolites and calcium
   silicate hydrates.}},

Abstract = {{Current plans for the disposal of intermediate-level radioactive waste
   in the U.K. include a cementitious backfill within the disposal caverns.
   Nuclides migrating from the repository into the rock will be preceded by
   an alkaline plume derived from the cement pore water. The alkaline plume
   will interact with the rock around the repository and may change the
   mineralogical and transport properties of the rock. An experimental and
   modelling study of alkali interaction with rock is presented. In the
   experiments, an alkaline solution was passed through a sample of
   Clashach Sandstone, which has a well-characterised mineralogy and is
   relatively homogeneous. The Ph and ionic composition of the eluate were
   measured and suggested a complex set of chemical reactions. After
   completion of the experiment, the sample was examined using SEM. These
   observations identified quartz and potassium feldspar dissolution, and
   precipitation of CSH phases.
   As a first stage in the interpretation of this behaviour, a very simple
   model was used. Successive refinements were made to the model to examine
   the effect of individual phenomena. Agreement with the steady-state Ph
   and Ca concentration was obtained with a model involving
   kinetically-controlled quartz dissolution and equilibrium precipitation
   of CSH phases. An initial period of several pore volumes, where the pH
   and Ca are buffered, can be explained qualitatively assuming sorption
   onto Fe phases. However, the amount of buffering predicted is
   significantly lower than that observed.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was performed in an aquifer in order to study
   multicomponent cation-exchange processes under natural flow conditions.
   The aquifer is a glacial outwash plain with sandy aquifer material
   having a cation-exchange capacity (CEC) of approximately 1.0 meq/100 g.
   A continuous injection of groundwater spiked with sodium and potassium
   as chlorides was accomplished over 37 days to resemble leachate
   contamination from landfills. The plume was monitored by sampling in a
   dense spatial network (length 100 m, width 20 m) over a period of 2.5
   years in order to obtain breakthrough curves and spatial contour maps of
   the chemical compounds. Na and especially K showed a substantial
   retardation caused by cation-exchange processes despite the low CEC of
   the aquifer material. The average velocity of K+ was only 10\% of the
   velocity of chloride (0.7 m day-1). The relative migration velocity of
   Na+ was not a constant in the plume, but apparently influenced by
   dilution. Ca2+ and Mg2+ were expelled from the cation-exchange sites of
   the aquifer material and subsequently transported with the same velocity
   as chloride. The breakthrough curves of the various compounds showed
   multiple peaks and low concentration zones. It was concluded by
   calculations with PHREEQE that changes in calcite equilibrium may occur
   in the lower part of the aquifer, while complexation processes seem to
   be of no importance. Cation exchange is then the most important process
   in this field experiment, and further evaluation of the data by a
   geochemical transport model including cation exchange is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{A large-scale and long-term field experiment on cation exchange in a
   sandy aquifer has been modelled by a three-dimensional geochemical
   transport model. The geochemical model includes cation-exchange
   processes using a Gaines-Thomas expression, the closed carbonate system
   and the effects of ionic strength. Information on geology, hydrogeology
   and the transient conservative solute transport behaviour was obtained
   from a dispersion study in the same aquifer. The geochemical input
   parameters were carefully examined. CEC and selectivity coefficients
   were determined on the actual aquifer material by batch experiments and
   by the composition of the cations on the exchange complex. Potassium
   showed a non-ideal exchange behaviour with K-Ca selectivity coefficients
   indicating dependency on equivalent fraction and K+ concentration in the
   aqueous phase. The model simulations over a distance of 35 m and a
   period of 250 days described accurately the observed attenuation of Na
   and the expelled amounts of Ca and Mg. Also, model predictions of
   plateau zones, formed by interaction with the background groundwater, in
   general agreed satisfactorily with the observations. Transport of K was
   simulated over a period of 800 days due to a substantially attenuation
   in the aquifer. The observed and the predicted breakthrough curves
   showed a reasonable accordance taking the duration of the experiment
   into account. However, some discrepancies were observed probably caused
   by the revealed non-ideal exchange behaviour of K+.}},

Abstract = {{Cation distributions in twenty samples of acid-generating salts were
   compared to those in groundwater and storm runoff from a coal-refuse
   deposit in an effort to identify source-product relationships. Two
   mineral suites, one primarily composed of melanterite, rozenite and
   szomolnokite, and the other composed almost entirely of copiapite, were
   found to be most abundant at the study site. Comparisons of cation
   distributions in salts with those in water samples lead to an hypothesis
   that a copiapite-rich suite precipitated from vadose-zone groundwater
   that was brought to the surface by evaporative forcing. The
   copiapite-rich suite, which contained larger concentrations of aluminum,
   calcium and zinc than the melanterite-rozenite-szomolnokite mineral
   suite, was the primary source of solutes in captured storm runoff.  An
   analysis of samples collected during a summer thunderstorm indicated
   that the chemistry of surface runoff varied little with time or with
   distance downstream. The cation distributions in samples of groundwater
   indicated that iron-rich pore waters observed near the surface in late
   autumn may have influenced water chemistry in the deeper portions of the
   unsaturated zone during the 1989 recharge season. The results or this
   study show that the solutes produced by the two observed salt suites can
   be distinguished by their mole percent iron and that the source-product
   relationships can explain observed variability in mine drainage
   chemistry at the study site.}},

Abstract = {{The Geneva freshwater lens is an isolated flow system within the upper
   Floridan aquifer surrounded and underlain by brackish water. The lens is
   sustained entirely by recharge from a surficial aquifer and sits atop a
   regional flow system which discharges around the fringes of the lens
   along the St. Johns River. Continual development of groundwater supply
   in the Geneva area has raised the concern of how much additional pumping
   can be allowed from various sites within the lens without adversely
   impacting water quality by inducing the invasion or upconing of salty
   water. A numerical modeling study was conducted to address these water,
   management issues. A density-dependent, finite-element flow and
   transport code, DSTRAM, was used for cross-sectional and
   three-dimensional (3-D) analyses of the Geneva lens system. The model
   incorporates an enhanced upstream weighted technique for the transport
   equation, improved Picard iterations over the nonlinearities, and robust
   preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) and ORTHOMIN techniques for
   solving the matrix equations. A steady-state model calibration was
   performed for existing conditions at the site. The cross-sectional (2-D)
   analysis was inadequate in accurately representing the system, since the
   3-D effects were considerable. However, 2-D cross-sectional simulations
   are useful for preliminary assessments of certain scenarios, and for
   guidance in developing the 3-D model. A comprehensive sensitivity
   analysis was performed on a number of key parameters. Natural
   groundwater discharge rates along the St. Johns River seem to be the
   most critical unknown and require better estimates for increased
   confidence in the conceptual model. Transient pumping scenarios were
   imposed on this system to observe the response of the lens and to
   determine well breakthrough for chlorides, if any.   Pumping rates and
   distribution of pumping were significant factors in determining the
   quality of the water. Upconing of saline water contributes to high
   chloride concentrations in water being pumped from the lens center. A
   localized pumping at the lens center does not affect the lens
   significantly till a critical value of withdrawal rate is reached,
   beyond which upconing of saline water is rapid. Lateral invasion is more
   prominent for pumping from locations near the edge of the lens. Maximum
   withdrawals of fresh water from the lens can be attained by evenly
   distributing the pumping throughout the freshwater zone.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of soil properties on the retention of kerosene in soils, at
   equilibrium and under venting, was studied. Eleven soils were studied,
   which represent a wide range of chemical properties and mechanical
   composition. The retention of kerosene in dry soils ranges from 3.5 to
   18.1 mL/(100 g), and was related linearly to clay, silt and organic
   matter (OM) contents. A coarsely-aggregated dry vertisol (2-5 mm
   aggregates) retained half as much kerosene as its finely-aggregated (<2
   mm) counterpart. Moisture content had a strong inverse effect on
   kerosene retention. The soil factors that inversely affected kerosene
   retention also enhanced kerosene stripping by venting. Of these, soil
   aggregation and porosity were the most important. In addition, kerosene
   volatilized faster and more completely from an initially moist soil, as
   compared with an initially dry soil. Differential volatilization of
   lighter components of kerosene changed the chemical composition of the
   residue in the soil substantially, as compared with the initial
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{Image analysis approaches provide an accurate and efficient way to
   generate detailed concentration distributions from photographic data of
   flow-tank experiments where the tracer can be observed through a glass
   or Plexiglas(R) wall. The technique is non-intrusive, does not disturb
   plume dynamics, and provides an essentially continuous distribution of
   sampling points over the whole plume, as observed at the tank wall.
   Computer processing of the scanned image is required to correct for
   spatial and temporal lighting nonuniformity, and for heterogeneous
   media, to account for different grain sizes, and thus differing dye
   thicknesses along tank walls. In our model study, utilizing a
   Plexiglas(R) flow tank (107 cm long, 71 cm high, 5 cm wide), individual
   concentrations are estimated for square areas approximately 1.3 by 1.3
   mm in size over the entire area of a side wall of the tank. The
   negatives were scanned on an Eikonix(R) 78/99 digital scanning system at
   a resolution of 1024 by 1024 by 12 bits. The image analysis system is
   comprised of a Digital Equipment Corporation Microvax II(R) computer and
   a Gould(R) IP9527 image processor. It transforms the scanned images,
   whose pixels represent dye intensity, into images whose pixels represent
   solute concentration.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study was to observe the location and form of a NAPL
   in a three-fluid-phase (air-NAPL-water) soil system utilizing an
   advanced microscopic technique, cryo-scanning electron microscopy
   (cryo-SEM) with X-ray analysis. A sandy aquifer material was brought to
   residual water (NaCl saturated) saturation (approximately 4\% by pore
   volume) followed by NAPL (iodobenzene) saturation, ranging from
   approximately 1\% to 80\%, using modified Tempe(R) pressure cells. A
   small intact soil core was obtained from the pressure cell and quickly
   frozen in liquid nitrogen. The core was fractured and chromium coated at
   a high vacuum and - 130-degrees-C. Secondary electron images (SEI) and
   X-ray dot maps (Si, Cl and I) were made of samples with different NAPL
   saturations. Photomicrographs and X-ray dot maps confirmed the existence
   of continuous NAPL films on soil (containing a residual water
   saturation) at high NAPL saturations. Photomicrographs revealed v-shaped
   wedges, pendular rings and films on irregular shaped sand grains. At low
   NAPL saturations (approximately 1\% by pore volume), iodine was
   virtually nondetectable in the overall X-ray analysis of the sample.
   This suggests that the small quantity of NAPL present in the sample
   probably existed as thin films or small isolated lenses or blobs.}},

Abstract = {{This hydrogeochemical study concerns the distribution, origins and
   behaviour of groundwaters in Quaternary sediments of southern Ontario,
   Canada, containing elevated concentrations of chloride. Major-ion,
   minor-ion and trace-metal analyses of 37 potential chloride sources and
   over 400 well waters, 70 urban springs and 30 pore waters are reported.
   Source chloride concentrations ranged up to 230,000 mg L-1 for brines
   from southwestern Ontario; for groundwaters in Quaternary sediments, the
   chlorides range up to 700 mg L-1 for domestic wells, 2,840 mg L-1 for
   urban springs and 13,700 mg L-1 for shallow pore waters.
   Regional studies performed in support of the study suggest that very
   little chloride enrichment is associated with natural chemical
   evolutionary processes. Background concentrations are in the range 15-20
   mg L-1 and these levels are exceeded in over half the wells in the area;
   potential sources include road salts, landfill leachates, agricultural
   fertilizers and saline bedrock waters. Most of these sources are found
   to be chemically pure with 2 or 3 major ions occurring to the virtual
   exclusion of all other constituents. Source trace-metal concentrations
   are low and none are diagnostic of origin. Only iodide and fluoride
   prove useful indicators of source. Iodide is especially useful for
   differentiating between road salts and saline bedrock waters, sources
   which are normally indistinguishable using major-ion criteria alone.
   From an inorganic water quality perspective, trace-metal concentrations

Abstract = {{Accurate three-dimensional simulations of saturated-unsaturated
   groundwater flow and contaminant transport in highly heterogeneous
   subsurface media require extreme agility in the numerical techniques of
   solution. The primary limitations of simulating large-scale complex
   field problems are the available computing power, and the considerable
   data management effort required to calibrate, validate and perform
   sensitivity analyses to these systems. An efficient finite-element model
   is presented which overcomes many of the challenges encountered in
   solving complex problems. The Galerkin and upstream weighted residual
   procedures are employed for solving the flow and transport equations.
   Options for using chord-slope Newton-Raphson linearization and upstream
   weighting of the relative permeabilities are necessary for highly
   nonlinear flow problems. Computational savings are otherwise achieved
   using the less robust Picard scheme. Underrelaxation formulas further
   alleviate convergence difficulties in the solution of the nonlinear
   equations. Hexahedral orthogonal curvilinear elements are used to
   accurately and efficiently discretize domains with irregular formation
   geometry, and transition elements are employed to grade the
   finite-element mesh for finer discretization only in regions of high
   gradients. Element matrices are generated using influence coefficient
   formulas, thus avoiding costly numerical integration. The 7-, 11- and
   27-point lattice connectivity structures are provided as options that
   increase the accuracy of solution, or enhance computational speed and
   storage requirements. Galerkin and upstream weighting schemes alleviate
   stability problems in solving the transport equations without excessive
   smearing of concentrations. Preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) and
   ORTHOMIN techniques are used to solve the large symmetric and asymmetric
   matrix equations arising from the assembly of the elemental flow and
   transport equations, respectively, and repeated matrix assembly and
   decomposition are eliminated from the calculations, if the situation
   permits. Assembly of the entire model is discussed, with reference to
   previously published works for details of schemes already tested and
   implemented. Only further developments of the schemes are detailed
   herein. Application of the model is demonstrated by selected simulation
   examples involving assessment of moisture movement and contaminant
   migration from a shallow waste disposal design above a multilayer
   unconfined aquifer system.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to determine the effect of
   uncertainty in model parameters and rainfall on uncertainty of model
   response and the impact of these uncertainties on sample size
   requirements for simulating solute transport through soils. The research
   was designed to demonstrate a methodology with general applicability.
   The approach should help one understand the model being used and the
   uncertainty in model response. The magnitude of uncertainty in the
   estimated solute transport resulting from parameter variability was
   found comparable to that resulting from rainfall variability. The
   combined parameter and rainfall variabilities appear to magnify overall
   uncertainty in estimated solute transport. The results of uncertainty
   analysis, in conjunction with the sampling theory, were used to
   determine the minimum number of random soil samples required to achieve
   a given degree of certainty in the estimated solute transport.
   Increasing soil sample size offers diminishing return in improving
   estimated solute transport because of natural rainfall variability.}},

Title = {{PASSIVE SAMPLING OF GROUNDWATER MONITORING WELLS WITHOUT PURGING -
   MULTILEVEL WELL CHEMISTRY AND TRACER DISAPPEARANCE}},

Abstract = {{It is essential that the sampling techniques utilized in groundwater
   monitoring provide data that accurately depicts the water quality of the
   sampled aquifer in the vicinity of the well. Due to the large amount of
   monitoring activity currently underway in the U.S.A. it is also
   important that the techniques be efficient. It would be desirable to
   minimize the requirements of sampling time, equipment and quantity of
   contaminated waters pumped to the surface, without loss of data
   integrity. If representative samples could be acquired without purging
   the wells, increased sampling efficiency could potentially be achieved.
   Purging of multiple borehole volumes is largely routine, based on
   studies that show changes in the water chemistry as it stands in the
   casing and is subjected to atmospheric exposure at the top of the
   column. However, little data are available depicting water chemistry in
   the screened intervals of wells at equilibrium flow conditions, i.e.
   with little or no disturbance to the natural flow regime or disruption
   of the overlying casing waters.
   This study examines the differences in water chemistry between the
   casing and screened interval volumes of four wells at a field site, then
   compares the results to purged values for the same wells. Tracer
   experiments, utilizing both colloidal particles and dissolved species as
   tracers, are presented to illustrate differences in natural flushing
   between the screened and cased intervals. The data from the tracer
   removal were then utilized to estimate groundwater flow velocities in
   the vicinities of the boreholes. The results indicate that dedicated
   low-flow rate samplers set in the screened intervals are appropriate for
   the 6. 1 - and 7.6-m wells at this site and could be used without
   purging of the casing volume. The possibility exists that such passive
   sampling techniques would be useful at many of the sites currently
   undergoing routine monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional multiphase flow experiment was conducted to
   investigate the redistribution of nonaqueous-phase liquids (NAPL's) in
   the subsurface. NAPL, water and air contents were measured with a
   dual-energy gamma-radiation attenuation apparatus, and NAPL and water
   pressures were measured with tensiometers that were inserted into the
   flow column. In the experiment, which used a sandy porous medium, both
   two-phase air-water and three-phase air-NAPL-water flow phenomena were
   measured. In the two-phase component of the experiment, water was
   drained from an initially water-saturated state by lowering the water
   table to a specified elevation. After the water drainage decreased to a
   negligible rate, the three-phase component of the experiment was
   initiated by infiltrating a 250-mL pulse of NAPL at the upper
   porous-medium boundary. Following a NAPL redistribution period, the
   water table was raised, lowered, and raised again. An objective of the
   experiment was to quantify the entrapment of air and NAPL under
   transient flow conditions. Analyses of the data showed that air was
   entrapped during NAPL imbibition, and NAPL and air were entrapped during
   water imbibition. The volume of entrapped fluids for similar saturation
   paths was reproducible, which suggested that fluid entrapment may be
   systematically modeled. It was concluded that to predict the movement of
   NAPL's in the subsurface, where the water-table elevation may fluctuate,
   constitutive relations among fluid saturations and pressures need to
   account for nonwetting fluid entrapment. The methodologies for
   conducting the measurements and associated error analysis are also given
   in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Flushing and in situ biodegradation can enhance the dissolution rate for
   NAPL contamination by decreasing the solute concentration, which
   increases the dissolution driving force. NAPL interphase transfer and
   how flushing and in situ bioremediation enhance it are evaluated using a
   simple NAPL contamination scenario: one-dimensional flow through a
   saturated, homogeneous, isotropic medium containing a residual
   saturation of uniformly distributed, immobilized, single-component NAPL
   blobs. A mathematical model of the system is developed using a
   one-dimensional advection-dispersion reaction (ADR) equation
   incorporating a first-order interphase mass-transfer relationship and
   first-order biodegradation kinetics. The analysis is simplified by
   assuming quasi-steady-state conditions in which NAPL blob size and
   saturation are constant. Using dimensionless groups that describe the
   relative rates in the system and analytical solutions to the ADR,
   criteria are delineated for when equilibrium and nonequilibrium exist
   and when flushing and biodegradation can effectively enhance NAPL
   dissolution in the system. These analyses are performed for flushing
   alone and for flushing and biodegradation in conjunction. The results
   demonstrate that flushing,is effective for enhancing dissolution when
   the flow rate gives solute concentrations that are neither zero nor the
   solubility limit throughout the domain. In situ biodegradation can
   accelerate the dissolution rate when the biodegradation rate becomes
   large, compared to the mass-transfer rate, and as long as neither the
   advection rate nor the biodegradation rate is so great that the solute
   concentration is zero throughout the domain.}},

Abstract = {{Batch experiments were carried out to investigate the biodegradation of
   phenols and aromatic hydrocarbons under anaerobic, nitrate-reducing
   conditions in groundwater from a creosote-contaminated site at
   Fredensborg, Denmark. The bacteria in the creosote-contaminated
   groundwater degraded a mixture of toluene, phenol, the cresols (o-, m-
   and p-cresol) and the dimethylphenols 2,4-DMP and 3,4-DMP at both
   10-degrees and 20-degrees-C. Benzene, the xylenes, naphthalene, 2,3-DMP,
   2,5-DMP, 2,6-DMP and 3,5-DMP were resistant to biodegradation during
   7-12 months of incubation. It was demonstrated that the degradation of
   toluene, 2,4-DMP, 3,4-DMP and p-cresol depended on nitrate or nitrite as
   electron acceptors. 40-80\% of the nitrate consumed during degradation
   of the aromatic compounds was recovered as nitrite, and the consumption
   of nitrate was accompanied by a production of ATP. Stoichiometric
   calculations indicate that in addition to the phenols and toluene other
   carbon sources present in the groundwater contributed to the consumption
   of nitrate. If the groundwater was incubated under anaerobic conditions
   without nitrate, sulphate-reducing conditions evolved after
   approximately 1 month at 20-degrees-C and approximately 2 months at
   10-degrees-C. In the sulphate-reducing batches disappearance of toluene,
   phenol, o-cresol and m-cresol was observed, whereas no removal of
   benzene, the xylenes, naphthalene, 2,3-DMP, 2,4-DMP, 2,5-DMP and 3,5-DMP
   was detected during 7 months of incubation.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory column experiments were conducted to investigate the
   reduction of gasoline component leaching through the use of soil
   venting. Soil columns and procedures employed were aimed at simulating
   conditions in the vadose zone. Gasoline-contaminated soil columns that
   had been subjected to varying periods of soil venting were leached with
   water under both saturated and unsaturated flow conditions. Experiments
   were conducted testing for non-equilibrium transport and demonstrating
   reductions of gasoline constituent leaching.
   Glass columns 10 cm long and 5.4 cm in diameter were packed with a clean
   glacial outwash sand and brought to low saturations of water and
   gasoline by controlling fluid pressures across capillary barriers. The
   columns were then subjected to steady air flow, each for a different
   length of time, so that each represented a different stage in the soil
   venting process. Water was percolated through these columns arid
   effluent was sampled and analyzed for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene,
   m-/p-xylenes, o-xylene and naphthalene. Results of experiments testing
   for non-equilibrium transport using changes in water flow rate,
   indicated that chemical equilibrium between phases was reached in
   effluent water. Results from columns vented for different lengths of
   time showed soil venting to be effective at reducing constituent
   concentrations in leachate ultimately to < 1 mug L-1. The results were
   compared to an equilibrium based soil venting model.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in the use of vapor extraction to remove volatile and
   semi-volatile organic compounds (VOC's) from unsaturated soils has been
   growing recently. To quantify the lateral extent of the zone of
   effective influence of a vapor extraction well, a new term, distance of
   effective sweep (R(e)) is introduced. This distance can be used to
   characterize the flow pattern, and it provides a guideline for
   determining the number and location of extraction wells needed at a
   contaminated site. In the present work, R(e) represents the distance of
   effective sweep from a line of wells (line sink). Analysis was performed
   to examine the role of the screen length, l, the extension of
   soil-surface sealing, r, and the vadose zone thickness, H, on R(e), in a
   case of an array of wells where the flow is two-dimensional in the
   vertical plane. A regression equation was found to describe the
   relationships between R(e) and the ratio of l/H. Additional analysis
   shows that vapor extraction treatment without soil-surface sealing may
   be most effective when the contaminant plume lateral dimension is
   smaller than one-half of the vadose zone height. Simulations with
   different r reveal that R(e) increases linearly with r. Simulations of
   transient scenarios indicate that the concept of distance of effective
   sweep is limited to permeable soils because the velocities developed in
   clay soils at the `'distance of effective sweep'' may be too low to be
   considered effective, and the time needed for the development of
   steady-state flow is very significant when compared to the duration of
   the vapor extraction operation.
   Additional analysis was performed on the distance of influence, R(i),
   which is the conventional parameter used to characterize the flow. The
   analysis suggests that R(i) has linear relationship with l/H, and that
   for the transient phase, R(i)(t), may depend on the permeability, K, in
   a logarithmic manner of the form: R(i)(t) = a(t)+b(t) In K}},

Abstract = {{A series of experiments was performed to characterize the morphologic
   distribution of nonaqueous-phase liquids (NAPL's) at residual
   saturation, as a function of porous medium size. Morphologic
   characterization of NAPL distributions was accomplished using a novel in
   situ polymerization technique. The porous medium consisted of glass
   beads. Blob length, volume and shape characteristics were determined for
   each experiment, and pore size distributions were determined through
   capillary pressure-saturation experiments. Both the blob length and pore
   size distributions were fitted to a van Genuchten function. Both blob
   length and pressure-saturation data could be scaled with the same
   averaged porous medium characteristics. The blob length distributions
   were found to be wider than the pore size distributions.
   Estimates of representative elementary volumes (REV's) were generated
   from statistical analysis using a van Genuchten cumulative frequency
   distribution function for blob length and an empirical function for blob
   volume as a function of blob length. Simulations were also performed
   using a Monte Carlo method. The size of the REV needed for a given level
   of prediction of the residual saturation level was found to increase as
   a function of mean particle volume for the similar media used in this
   study. Extrapolation of the REV analysis suggests that the size of an
   REV will increase rapidly as uniformity of the medium decreases. If this
   extrapolation holds true, significant uncertainty would exist in most
   determinations of residual saturation for poorly sorted media that have
   been reported to date.}},

Abstract = {{A user friendly, finite-difference groundwater transport model, called
   `'Multi-substrate, Multi-option Groundwater Transport Model (MMGTM)'',
   has been developed to afford users several options in defining a
   transport sequence. In addition to advective-dispersive transport, the
   model incorporates a variety of adsorption and biological decay
   mechanisms. Adsorption can be simulated for linear, Langmuir, or
   Freundlich isotherms coupled with equilibrium or non-equilibrium mass
   transfer. Biological decay can be simulated for first-order or
   Monod-type approaches, and can be linked to oxygen consumption and
   transport. Aqueous and sorbed phase decay can be simulated.
   Further, the transport of two substrates and oxygen can be simulated
   concurrently and the interaction between them can be described as
   competitive, diauxic-like or simultaneous. The growth of biomass and its
   effect as an adsorbent can also be simulated by means of a
   stoichiometric yield coefficient and a biomass/adsorbent conversion
   factor. Continuous or pulse input of solute in conjunction with either
   constant-mass-flux or constant-concentration boundaries can be selected.
   Menu screens allow the user to configure each problem while parameters
   can be input individually or called from a separate data file. The input
   data can be viewed, modified or saved before simulation. Output is
   visually displayed on the screen as breakthrough and profile curves,
   while also being saved to an ASCII file on a disk for subsequent
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Three natural-gradient injection experiments in the Borden aquifer
   (Ontario, Canada) (approximately 100-300 days in duration) and a 452-day
   laboratory microcosm experiment were performed to evaluate the
   biotransformation of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-, m-,
   p-xylenes) derived from gasoline under anaerobic, denitrifying
   conditions. Both NO3--amended and unamended control (i.e. no NO3 added)
   experiments were performed. In the unamended control injection
   experiment, toluene biotransformed between 1 and 5 m from the injection
   well. All other aromatic compounds were recalcitrant in this field
   experiment and all aromatic compounds were recalcitrant in unamended
   control microcosms. After an acclimatization period, toluene
   biotransformed relatively rapidly in the presence of NO3- in both the
   laboratory and field to a residual level of approximately 100 mug L-1.
   In the presence of NO3- the xylene isomers and ethylbenzene
   biotransformed to a lesser degree. Benzene was recalcitrant in all
   experiments. The acetylene blockage technique was used to demonstrate
   that denitrifying bacteria were active in the presence of NO3-. In the
   NO3--amended injection experiments, little BTEX mass loss occurred
   beyond the 1-m multilevel-piezometer fence. However, NO3- continued to
   decline downgradient, suggesting that other sources of carbon were being
   utilized by denitrifying bacteria in preference to residual BTEX. In
   addition to observations on mass loss, these experiments provided
   evidence of inhibition of BTEX biotransformation in the presence of
   acetylene, and competitive utilization between toluene, ethylbenzene and
   the xylene isomers. Given the recalcitrance of benzene and high
   thresholds of the compounds that did biotransform, the addition of NO3-
   as an alternate electron acceptor would not be successful in this
   aquifer as a remedial measure.}},

Abstract = {{Vapor-phase transport of organic pollutants is one of the important
   pathways in the distribution and attenuation of volatile organic
   compounds in the vadose zone. In this study, the impact of vapor-phase
   partitioning and of the physical-chemical properties of organic
   pollutants on vapor-phase transport was assessed. An experimentally
   derived relationship to predict vapor sorption for a variety of soil
   types under varying soil moisture conditions was incorporated into the
   two-dimensional finite-element model, VOCWASTE. The revised model was
   then used to simulate the transport of volatile organics. Vapor-phase
   partitioning in the model accounted for vapor uptake by sorption onto
   moist mineral surfaces as well as sorption at the liquid-solid interface
   and dissolution into soil water. Under dry conditions, vapor-phase
   sorption of volatile organic pollutants was shown to have a retarding
   effect on transport of organic vapors. However, for shallow,
   contaminated soils, volatilization was controlled by vapor diffusion,
   even under dry conditions where vapor-phase sorption was high. The
   influence of Henry's law constant and of the aqueous-phase
   (solid-liquid) partition coefficient for volatile organic pollutants was
   considered in the simulations. Volatilization of organic vapors was
   shown to be favored for contaminants with high Henry's law constants and
   low aqueous-phase partitioning coefficients. Because of the
   interdependence of these two physical-chemical properties, individual
   properties of the contaminant should not be considered in isolation in
   the evaluation of vapor transport.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental results are reported which delineate the vaporization modes
   of single and binary hydrocarbon liquids held in homogeneous and
   heterogeneous porous media during air venting. The experiments were
   performed in a two-dimensional apparatus which allowed visual
   observation of the evolving geometry of the liquid contaminant pool
   under various conditions. In homogeneous sand packings, the contaminant
   pool receded primarily from the upstream edge to the downstream edge
   during venting. In heterogeneous (dual permeability) sand packs, the
   permeability ratio of the high- to low-permeability zones was found to
   be an important factor on the geometric evolution of the contaminant
   pool. Different permeability ratios were investigated for a
   high-permeability layer above a contaminant pool trapped in a
   low-permeability layer. For permeability ratios below 10:1, the pool
   geometry evolved in a similar manner as in the homogeneous sand pack
   because a significant amount of airflow passed through the contaminant
   in the low-permeability zone. For ratios greater than 100:1 the pool
   receded downward from the interface of the two layers into the
   low-permeability zone, and the venting became limited by diffusion of
   the contaminant vapors from the low-permeability zone to the air flowing
   in the high-permeability zone. During venting of binary mixtures from
   dual-permeability sand packs with large permeability ratios, the mass
   fractions of the two components in the vapor-phase exhibited three
   distinct stages: (1) an early, rapid decrease in the mass fraction ratio
   of the more volatile to less volatile compound due to a depletion of the
   more volatile component at the evaporating surface in the liquid; (2) a
   period of constant mass fraction ratio resulting from a
   quasi-steady-state evaporation of the liquid pool which receded into the
   low-permeability zone; and (3) a long-term gradual decrease in the mass
   fraction ratio of the more volatile to less volatile compound caused by
   the diminishing size of the contaminant pool.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of humic substances were obtained from a waterworks at Fuhrberg,
   Germany. The material had a bimodal molecular size distribution with
   approximately 40\% of the total carbon in the 50,000-100,000-D (nominal
   molecular weight, NMW, in daltons) size fraction and approximately 50\%
   of the carbon in the < 10,000-D (NMW) size fraction. The fulvic and
   humic acids isolated from the bulk humic substances were low in nitrogen
   content and had low H/C atomic ratios. Furthermore, the fulvic and humic
   acids had very similar elemental, spectral and copper binding
   characteristics. Over 70\% of the carbon in both the fulvic and humic
   acids was present in aromatic or aliphatic groups, with C-13 NMR
   analyses indicating approximately even distribution among the two types.
   Competitive elemental binding studies indicated that Ca2+, Mg2+, Al3+

Abstract = {{The spreading coefficient, C(sp), determines whether an organic
   immiscible liquid, OIL, will form a lens (C(sp) < 0) or will spread
   spontaneously (C(sp) > 0) on a water surface. An OIL that forms a lens
   does not perfectly wet the water surface and therefore has a contact
   angle greater than 0-degrees. The one-dimensional rate at which an OIL
   spreads spontaneously on a water surface is proportional to the square
   root of C(sp). Of the OIL's that pose a contaminant threat to the
   subsurface, the majority has a non-zero C(sp). To test the influence of
   such interfacial spreading phenomena on OIL infiltration in a pristine
   vadose zone, upward OIL and water imbibition infiltration experiments
   were performed in glass-bead columns, moistened with water, by using
   OIL's with different C(sp). An analytical model for saturated liquid
   front rise was used to inversely estimate the effective capillary
   pressure head at the front and the average liquid conductivity. A
   nonspreading OIL (C(sp) much less than 0) exhibited a reduced capillary
   pressure head in the water-wetted glass beads. A spontaneously spreading
   OIL (C(sp) much greater than 0) manifested an enhanced capillary
   pressure head. Reduced capillary pressure head was associated with an
   increase in average conductivity, and enhanced capillary pressure head
   was associated with a decrease in average conductivity when compared to
   the average water conductivity during water imbibition. The employed
   experimental method and mathematical analysis of dynamic flow, subject
   to interfacial spreading phenomena, are practical for quantifying
   parameters for use in sharp-front OIL infiltration models, but more
   research is needed to determine how to incorporate the spreading
   coefficient in numerical multiphase flow models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a screening model for evaluating the migration of
   organic and inorganic contaminants leached from land-disposed wastes.
   The model is composed of a waste-zone release submodel, an
   unsaturated-zone transport submodel and a saturated-zone transport
   submodel. The waste-zone submodel assumes steady one-dimensional
   vertical flow through a uniform waste zone treated as a ``stirred tank
   reactor{''}. Soluble inorganic contaminants are assumed to exhibit a
   constant concentration in the leachate until mass depletion occurs,
   while organic contaminants are assumed to exhibit leachate
   concentrations that are proportional to the mass fraction in the oily
   waste phase. Vertical, one-dimensional, unit-gradient flow is assumed in
   the unsaturated zone at a constant water content controlled by the net
   infiltration rate and the unsaturated soil permeability function.
   Transport occurs by convection and scale-dependent dispersion with
   linear adsorption and decay. In the saturated zone, flow is assumed to
   be planar, with three-dimensional convective-dispersive transport,
   adsorption and decay, with a rectangular horizontal source at the water
   table. The waste-zone submodel defines the boundary conditions for the
   unsaturated-zone submodel, which, in turn, defines the boundary
   conditions for the saturated-zone submodel. Because of the
   semi-analytical nature of the model, it can be executed very quickly,
   thus enabling rapid screening analyses and implementation in Monte Carlo
   analyses, which require a large number of model executions.}},

Abstract = {{We have studied tracer dispersion in stratified media made of
   alternating layers of glass beads with different permeabilities. Both
   transmission experiments and echo experiments, in which the tracer is
   first injected into the sample and then pumped back through a detector,
   have been used. When there is no exchange between layers, the
   transmission dispersion curves give the permeability contrast, while the
   echo curves give the dispersivity of individual layers (namely their
   grain size if they are homogeneous). If the transverse transport between
   layers homogenizes the concentration across the sample, echo and
   transmission dispersivities are identical and related to the layer
   thickness and the transverse dispersivity. We observed the transition
   between both regimes as the flow velocity decreases in thin-layered
   samples. In samples with thicker layers, transverse tracer spreading
   requires more time; in addition, strong gravity effects associated to
   very small density variations with the tracer concentration were
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{Most capillary pressure (P(c))-saturation (S) curves are determined with
   a pressure or tension apparatus containing a porous medium sample of
   often > 5 cm in height. If the porous medium sample consists of a rather
   coarse-grained material and the interfacial tension between the wetting
   and non-wetting fluid is sufficiently low, it is not inconceivable that
   large changes in S occur over the height of the sample. Using. the
   standard procedure of measuring the outflow volume of one of the fluids,
   from which average values of S are then calculated, can therefore result
   in substantial errors. In this study a method is proposed to measure
   P(c)-S drainage and imbibition-relationships for TCE-air and TCE-water
   systems at points along a 1-m-long column with the help of a
   gamma-radiation system and from knowledge of the fluid pressure
   distributions at hydraulic equilibrium. The results show that S-values
   changed from complete saturation to their residual values, and vice
   versa, over P(c) changes ranging from 2.5 to 10 cm of water pressure,
   which makes the use of, e.g., a pressure cell a dubious procedure for
   certain fluid systems.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of field plot experiments were performed to characterize
   the downward flow of three pesticides (atrazine, napropamide and
   prometryn) and a water tracer (chloride) under various soil water
   regimes and soil surface conditions. Each experiment consisted of the
   uniform application of a 0.4-cm pulse of a solution containing a mixture
   of the four chemicals to the surface of a 1.5 x 1.5-m plot. The plot was
   then irrigated with 12 cm of water and soil samples were collected and
   analyzed to a depth of 150 cm. In all, 64 different plots were employed
   to study individual as well as interactive effects of such variables as
   irrigation method (continuous or intermittent sprinkling or ponding),
   pesticide formulation method (technical grade dissolved in water,
   wettable powder, or emulsifiable concentrate), and tillage (undisturbed
   or tilled and repacked surface layer) on pesticide transport.
   While all three pesticides were expected to be retained in the top 10-20
   cm, there was considerable movement below this zone. When averaged over
   all the treatments, 18.8\% of the recovered mass of atrazine, 9.4\% of
   the prometryn and 16.4\% of the napropamide were found between 30- and
   150-cm depth. Moreover, all pesticides were highly mobile in the surface
   30 cm regardless of their adsorption coefficient. There were occurrences
   of extreme mobility or ``preferential flow{''} of pesticide under every
   experimental condition except where the pesticides were applied in
   wettable powder form to plots which had their surface tilled and
   repacked. This finding implies that there may be fine preferential flow
   pathways through which solution may move but particulates may not.}},

Abstract = {{Increased nitrate concentrations in groundwater associated with the
   application of nitrogen fertilizers have led to inquiries concerning the
   fate of nitrate beneath agricultural fields. This study was conducted to
   identify the processes affecting the distribution of nitrate in the
   unsaturated and saturated zones beneath an agricultural field and to
   assess how each process is influenced by factors associated with slope
   position. Nested piezometers were installed at two slope positions at
   the study site in southeastern Washington, U.S.A. Unsaturated- and
   saturated-zone sediment cores were analyzed for water content, pH, total
   and soluble organic carbon, ammonium, nitrate, and denitrification
   potential. Waters from the piezometers showed decreasing nitrate
   concentrations with depth below the water table. Trends in measured
   parameters indicated depth intervals where the distribution of nitrate
   could be attributed either solely to transport or to a combination of
   transport and biological denitrification. Denitrification explained the
   distribution of nitrate in the root zone while transport explained the
   interval between the root zone and the water table. There was a higher
   potential for denitrification below the water table at the bottom slope
   than at the top slope. Factors associated with slope position, such as a
   shallow water table and impeding stratigraphic layers, may explain this
   higher potential.
   Regardless of slope position, comparing nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide
   production from nitrate- and carbon-amended or -unamended samples
   indicated that denitrifier populations present in high-potential zones
   arc nitrate-limited. Results from spherical microsite modelling suggest
   that anoxic conditions are possible in the bulk sediment despite the
   presence of oxygenated groundwaters beneath both slope positions.
   Advective-dispersive transport will continue to transport nitrate
   through the unsaturated and saturated zones. The data from this study
   suggest that there is greater potential for nitrate attenuation by
   denitrification beneath the bottom slope than the top slope. The data
   also show that large masses of nitrate reside in deep subsoil vadose
   zones. These regions must therefore be monitored to detect threats to
   future groundwater quality.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most acute problems facing water resources in semi-arid
   regions is the ongoing salinization of groundwater. The example
   discussed in the paper is from the Coastal Plain aquifer of Israel where
   most attention has been given until recently to salinization due to
   seawater encroachment. The present study revealed that large amounts of
   salt have been added to this aquifer along its eastern boundary which is
   in close proximity to a syncline filled by Tertiary chalks and marl. The
   saline water is characterized by high tritium levels and a stable
   isotope composition which differs from that of local rains. It is
   suggested that intensive irrigation with water imported from the Sea of
   Galilee induced flow in old fractures and in solution channels developed
   in the underlying chalks. These channels are filled with soluble salts
   which accumulated during the Holocene in the Tertiary aquitard and were
   mobilized as a result of increased irrigation of overlying soils. The
   soluble salts reached groundwater and ultimately flowed into the
   adjacent sandy Coastal Plain aquifer. Overpumping of the Coastal Plain
   aquifer caused continuous lowering of the groundwater table enhancing
   flow and considerable transport of solutes from the adjacent aquitard.}},

Abstract = {{Samples from 75 sample locations in a landfill leachate pollution plume
   reveal a significant disappearance of specific organic compounds (SOC's)
   within the first 100 m of the plume. Only the herbicide Mecoprop(R)
   (MCPP) migrates further. Since sorption and dilution cannot account for
   the decreasing concentrations, degradation is considered to be the
   governing process. Non-volatile organic carbon shows a corresponding
   fate probably acting as a substrate for the microbial processes. The
   first 20 m of the plume are methanogenic/sulfidogenic, judged on the
   chemistry of the groundwater, followed by a significant ferrogenic zone
   exhibiting a substantial capacity to degrade the SOC's. The presence of
   intermediary products (here an oxidized camphor compound) supports the
   concept of degradation within the ferrogenic zone. This investigation
   draws the attention to the significant natural attenuation of organic
   contaminants and to the so far neglected ferrogenic zone in controlling
   the fate of organic contaminants in leachate plumes.}},

Abstract = {{The dissolution and transport of trapped nonaqueous phase liquid
   hydrocarbon (oil) was examined in a laboratory column study using
   aquifer material from a site contaminated with aviation gasoline. Two
   mathematical models were compared for simulating the dissolution of
   trapped oil. The first model assumes that mass transfer will be rapid
   relative to groundwater flow and that the concentrations in the aqueous
   and oil phases will be at equilibrium. The second model assumes that
   mass transfer between the aqueous and oil phases is best described by a
   linear resistance relationship. Both models assume that equilibrium
   concentrations in the oil and the aqueous phases can be estimated by
   equating activities in each phase. Numerical simulations using both
   models are generated and compared with column study results. Overall,
   the kinetic model appears to provide a somewhat better description of
   the dissolution process, although this model requires significantly
   greater computation times. A simple procedure is described to develop an
   order of magnitude estimate of the number of pore volumes of water
   required to flush individual hydrocarbons from the aquifer material.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (HDTMA), a cationic
   surfactant, on aquifer material from Columbus AFB, Mississippi, U.S.A.,
   was examined. Transport studies using flow-through columns and a box
   model aquifer showed that an almost stationary zone of HDTMA-modified
   aquifer material could be produced in situ without a significant
   decrease in hydraulic conductivity.
   Perchloroethylene (PCE) and naphthalene sorption isotherms on the
   HDTMA-modified aquifer material were linear, and sorption coefficients
   were increased by over two orders of magnitude relative to the
   unmodified material. The retardation of PCE by in situ emplaced HDTMA
   zones within a column was examined. Agreement between batch- and
   column-derived sorption coefficients and breakthrough curve symmetry
   indicates that local equilibrium was attained. Significant retardation
   of a naphthalene plume by an in situ emplaced surfactant zone was
   demonstrated in the box model aquifer system.
   The experimental results indicate that it is feasible to create in situ
   a sorbent zone within an aquifer using cationic surfactants. In most
   situations, the sorbent zone concept needs to be coupled with
   contaminant degradation processes for sorbent emplacement to be a
   practical tool in the remediation of groundwater contamination sites.
   Sorbent zones may be of benefit in the engineering of suitable
   environments for microbial or abiotic degradation reactions and by
   providing time for slow reactions to occur.}},

Abstract = {{The LEACHM model was evaluated using data from a field experiment
   conducted in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. Many of the
   parameter input values were the means of determinations for soil samples
   from the field site. Measured nitrogen (N) uptake and nitrate (NO3-N)
   storage in the soil profile, as well as mineralization and nitrification
   rates were higher in 1987 than in 1988. The measured N removal by crops
   was taken as the simulated N uptake. A reasonably good agreement between
   simulated and measured values was obtained for NO3-N storage. However,
   higher rate constants had to be used for 1987 than for 1988 in order to
   match simulated with measured storage. The simulated soil solution NO3-N
   concentrations at 1.2-m depth agreed quite well with those measured in
   porous cup water samples, except for the highest ammonium nitrate
   treatment. In general, the simulation results indicated that the LEACHM
   model described the nitrogen dynamics fairly well.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a great deal of attention has focused on the
   development of various methods to predict the fate of immiscible
   contaminants (NAPL's) in soils. In an attempt to satisfy this
   requirement, a host of numerical models has been developed.
   Unfortunately, there exist little experimental data to verify the
   assumptions used in the derivation of these immiscible flow models. One
   objective of this paper is to report on a non-destructive measurement
   technique which was used to capture the relative organic-phase
   saturation variations in a number of two-phase flow displacement
   experiments.
   The data obtained from these experiments were compared to results
   obtained from a one-dimensional, finite-element based, two-phase flow
   model.
   The experiments consisted of five separate trials using three different
   immiscible liquids (hydraulic oil, kerosene and hexane) in a
   water-saturated column. Irregular immiscible liquid infiltration fronts
   were observed in four of the five experiments, indicating that very
   small-scale heterogeneities control the infiltration of immiscible
   liquids into soil. Independent of the column experiments,
   saturation-capillary pressure curves were determined for the various
   liquids.
   In general, the simulated NAPL saturation vs. time profiles agreed very
   well with the observations for all five of the trials.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory diffusion-test estimation of the diffusion coefficient (D)
   and the adsorption coefficient (K(d)) for several volatile organic
   species in a saturated, relatively undisturbed, clayey soil is
   presented. The species considered were acetone, 1,4-dioxane, aniline,
   chloroform and toluene, at maximum concentrations ranging from 200 to
   300 mg L-1. In addition to the diffusion tests, batch tests were
   performed for aniline, chloroform and toluene, and the resulting
   K(d)-values were compared with those estimated from the diffusion tests.
   For the more soluble species (acetone, 1,4-dioxane and aniline) D- and
   K(d)-values were readily inferred from the diffusion-test results and
   are considered to accurately represent diffusion through the soil and
   adsorption onto the soil solids under the conditions imposed. For the
   hydrophobic species (chloroform and toluene), the inferred D- and
   K(d)-values from the diffusion test are significantly influenced by
   adsorption of the species onto the diffusion cell materials, resulting
   in unreasonably high D- and K(d)-values. However, it is shown that by
   combining the results of both batch tests and diffusion tests, an upper
   and lower bound estimate of D and K(d) may be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation and movement of aldicarb residues from an emergence
   application was measured in soil and groundwater beneath potato fields
   near Deerfield, Massachusetts, and Savannah, New York. Soil samples
   collected following the application showed that aldicarb residues
   degraded at a rate corresponding to a half-life of approximately 1.1
   months. This half-life is consistent with previous studies.
   At the Massachusetts location, residues in half of the plot were
   confined to the upper 1.2 m of soil. In the other half of the plot which
   was temporarily flooded due to an overflow of a nearby pond, residue
   movement exceeded 4.8 m and residues up to 21-mu-g L-1 were observed in
   the upper 1.5 m of the saturated zone. No residues were observed in
   wells installed farther than 40 m from the treated area and residues in
   all wells dropped below 10-mu-g L-1 within 16 months of the aldicarb
   application.
   At the New York site, aldicarb residues entered shallow groundwater
   after a period of heavy rainfall in late November and early December of
   1986. During the study, aldicarb residues were confined to shallow
   groundwater directly beneath or within 5 m of the treatment area.
   Aldicarb residues in excess of 10-mu-g L-1 were not found deeper than
   approximately 2.5 m below the water table. Aldicarb residues had
   declined to below 1-mu-g L-1 in all monitoring wells within 5 yr,
   implying an average half-life of aldicarb residues in groundwater of < 1
   yr.}},

Abstract = {{We consider reactive solute transport in a soil consisting of two layers
   that have different (bio)chemical properties. Assuming adsorption is
   adequately described with the Freundlich equation, the degree of
   adsorption nonlinearity differs. Using simple corrections the fronts are
   approximated analytically for the case that the top layer adsorbs
   nonlinearly whereas the subsoil layer adsorbs linearly (case 1) and for
   the case 2 that the layering order is reversed. By comparison with
   numerical calculations we show the adequacy of the analytical
   approximations as well as the effect of layering order on the subsoil
   front shapes. The layering order appears to affect the fronts which is
   in disagreement with previously published conclusions by H.M. Selim and
   coworkers. For the case of a layered soil with nonlinear adsorption and
   first-order decay, analytical approximations appear to describe the
   numerically found fronts well.}},

Abstract = {{Development of practical techniques to predict thc mobility of
   halogenated hydrocarbons in aquifers is an important step toward
   protecting the quality of groundwater resources. This study involved the
   use of laboratory-column and field-column experiments to estimate
   retardation coefficients of five halogenated hydrocarbons (bromoform,
   carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-dichlorobenzene and
   hexachloroethane) in the Borden aquifer. These compounds were selected
   because they were used in the highly-monitored, natural-gradient
   field-tracer experiment conducted in the unconfined sand aquifer at
   Canadian Forces Base Borden in southern Ontario, Canada. The
   field-column experiments were conducted in the vicinity of the
   natural-gradient tracer experiment, and the laboratory experiments were
   conducted using aquifer material collected from thc field site. The
   retardation coefficients were found to increase as the average
   pore-water velocity in the columns decreased, suggesting the presence of
   non-equilibrium conditions in the reactive transport process. Analysis
   of the data with a two-site reactive-solute transport model, that allows
   for time-dependent interaction between solutes and a fraction of
   reaction sites, provided significant improvement over analysis with a
   reactive-solute transport model that assumes local equilibrium. For
   experiments conducted at similar velocities, the mobilities were in
   close agreement for both the laboratory- and field-column experiments.
   Retardation factors calculated from batch experiments also agreed
   closely with the column results and were consistent with those obtained
   from previous studies at the Borden site. While the retardation factors
   calculated from the present small-scale methods were in close agreement
   with those observed during the first month of the large-scale
   natural-gradient experiment, large deviations were observed for longer
   travel times.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion coefficients for four volatile organic compounds of
   environmental concern, benzene, trichloroethylene, toluene and
   chlorobenzene, were measured on cores of saturated, unweathered
   glaciolacustrine clay obtained. from boreholes at a hazardous waste
   disposal site near Sarnia, Ontario. The core material was transferred to
   stainless-steel cylinders constructed such that a closed solution
   reservoir was in contact with the upper surface of the core. The decline
   in concentration of the organic compounds in the reservoir was monitored
   over time and diffusion coefficients were determined by fitting a
   solution of the diffusion equation to the resulting data. The measured
   diffusion coefficients ranged from 0.3 . 10(-7) to 1.1 . 10(-7) cm2 s-1
   for the four compounds, and were in reasonable agreement with values
   determined from concentration profiles in the clay material beneath the
   disposal pits.
   Diffusion coefficients were also calculated on the basis of distribution
   coefficients (K(d)) determined from laboratory batch tests and from
   correlations with the organic carbon content of the clay material
   (f(oc)). Values calculated on the basis of batch tests were
   substantially lower than the measured values, and those calculated on
   the basis of f(oc) exceeded the measured values by almost an order of
   magnitude. The results indicate that reasonable estimates of diffusion
   coefficients for hydrophobic organic contaminants, for the purpose of
   predicting diffusive transport in natural fine-grained geologic
   materials can be obtained using the diffusion-cell procedure described
   in this paper. The poor estimate of the diffusion coefficients provided
   by the f(oc) correlation procedure is consistent with significant
   sorption onto the mineral phase. Though not investigated, sample
   disturbance may have contributed to the low values calculated on the
   basis of batch K(d)'s.}},

Abstract = {{Redox electrodes are commonly used to measure redox potentials in
   complex natural systems. In this paper, an approach based on electrode
   kinetics to interpreting measured redox potentials is presented. Redox
   couples dissolved in aqueous solutions are classified as sensor
   effective redox couples (SERC's), which exchange electrons with the
   electrode surface at a significant rate, and sensor ineffective redox
   couples (SIRC's), which do not control the potential of the electrode.
   Going through the corresponding mathematical formalism, we arrive at a
   Butler-Volmer-type equation which states that a quantitative
   interpretation of redox potentials is not possible without understanding
   the nature of SERC's and their electrode kinetic parameters. A
   sensitivity analysis of effects of these unknown parameters on the redox
   potential is presented. Implications for interpretations of potential
   readings in natural samples are discussed. Finally, outlooks for
   necessary future experimental studies are given.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of preferred flow pathways is critical for waste disposal.
   These pathways reduce the effectiveness of thick desert soils in
   attenuating contaminants by short-circuiting flow through the
   unsaturated zone. Unsaturated flow in fissured sediments in the
   Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, U.S.A., was examined to determine if these
   sediments act as preferred pathways for water and solute transport.
   Fissures are surface features, or gulleys, that are underlain by
   fractures filled with loose sediment washed in from surrounding areas.
   Hydraulic and chemical approaches were used to investigate unsaturated
   flow processes beneath and adjacent to fissures, and the results were
   compared with data from surrounding geomorphic systems such as arroyos,
   ephemeral streams and interstreams. Typically, high water potentials in
   surficial sediments result from infiltration of recent precipitation.
   Below this surficial zone of high water potentials lies a zone of low
   water potentials that is much thinner beneath the fissure than in
   adjacent sediments or in sediments beneath ephemeral streams and
   interstreams. Maximum chloride concentrations in profiles in the
   fissured sediments (80-105 g m-3) were much lower than those measured in
   all other geomorphic systems (2000-6000 g m-3) because chloride is
   leached in the vicinity of the fissures. Minimum estimates of the
   moisture flux from chloride data ranged from 1 to 8 mm yr-1 in the
   fissured sediments and were up to 350 times greater than those
   calculated for ephemeral stream and interstream settings. The
   corresponding moisture velocities in the fissured sediments ranged from
   10 to 70 mm yr-1. A tracer experiment demonstrated higher downward water
   and solute transport in the fracture fill beneath the fissure relative
   to adjacent sediments. Numerical simulations of the tracer experiment
   with the computer code TRACR3D reproduced the overall shape of the
   tracer plume. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the tracer plume is
   most sensitive to spatial variability in soil texture and the
   corresponding hydraulic parameters. The results from this study suggest
   that sediments in the fissured area act as preferred pathways because
   surface runoff is concentrated in the fissures and because underlying
   fractures and cavities provide avenues for rapid moisture and solute
   transport. Comparisons of moisture fluxes in fissured sediments in this
   system with fluxes in preferred pathways in other arid regions indicate
   that the primary controls on percolation rates are the duration of
   inundation and the presence of subsurface structures such as fractures
   or sinkholes that allow rapid water and solute movement.}},

Abstract = {{The prolongation of in situ remediation due to aquifer heterogeneities
   is investigated in a series of Monte Carlo simulations. The remediation
   time in a homogeneous aquifer with an equal initial mass of organic
   pollutant serves as a reference. Non-uniform distributions of hydraulic
   conductivity and initial pollutant mass in the model are generated with
   a turning bands method assuming a log-normal distribution for both
   quantities. Deterministic reactive transport is computed in each aquifer
   realization with a coupled two-dimensional numerical model accounting
   for concentration changes due to advection, dispersion and aerobic
   microbial growth.
   A single-quarter five-spot serves as model area, where saturated
   groundwater flow is induced by an injection and a pumping well
   exclusively. The different model runs are compared on the basis of their
   respective time to achieve 90\% pollutant removal. For the sake of
   comparability, the realizations are constructed such that they have
   equal initial pollutant mass and equal geometric mean of the hydraulic
   conductivity.
   Superposition of heterogeneous distributions of hydraulic conductivity
   and initial pollutant mass as well as an increase in standard deviations
   of both random variables from 0.92 to 1.84 had a pronounced unfavourable
   effect on remediation time, while doubling the auto-correlation length
   had only a smaller negative influence. In general, any type of
   heterogeneity tested in the numerical experiments led to a decreased
   overall pollutant removal rate compared to the homogeneous case.
   Furthermore, the crucial impact of local dispersivity as well as
   numerical dispersivity on removal time is shown. Due to the non-linear
   nature of the problem only a rough estimate can be derived to transfer
   results to situations with different initial masses.
   Finally, a method is presented to increase efficiency of in situ
   remediation in heterogeneous aquifers by operational means. It consists
   of changing locations of the active injection and pumping wells after a
   certain time in such a way that the mean flow direction in the
   single-quarter five-spot is changed by an angle of 90-degrees. Although
   this scheme demands twice the number of wells compared to the common
   scheme, it renders the remediation much more robust and thus
   trustworthy.}},

Abstract = {{Measurement of the fluid-content distribution at sites contaminated by
   immiscible fluids, including crude oil, is needed to better understand
   the movement of these fluids in the subsurface and to provide data to
   calibrate and verify numerical models and geophysical methods. A
   laboratory method was used to quantify the fluid contents of 146 core
   sections retrieved from boreholes aligned along a 120-m longitudinal
   transect at a crude-oil spill site near Bemidji, Minnesota, U.S.A. The
   47-mm-diameter, minimally disturbed cores spanned a 4-m vertical
   interval contaminated by oil. Cores were frozen on site in a dry
   ice-alcohol bath to prevent redistribution and loss of fluids while
   sectioning the cores. We gravimetrically determined oil and water
   contents using a two-step method: (1) samples were slurried and the oil
   was removed by absorption onto strips of hydrophobic porous polyethylene
   (PPE); and (2) the samples were oven-dried to remove the water. The
   resulting data show sharp vertical gradients in the water and oil
   contents and a clearly defined oil body. The subsurface distribution is
   complex and appears to be influenced by sediment heterogeneities and
   water-table fluctuations. The center of the oil body has depressed the
   water-saturated zone boundary, and the oil is migrating laterally within
   the capillary fringe. The oil contents are as high as 0.3 cm3 cm-3,
   which indicates that oil is probably still mobile 10 years after the
   spill occurred. The thickness of oil measured in wells suggests that
   accumulated thickness in wells is a poor indicator of the actual
   distribution of oil in the subsurface. Several possible sources of error
   are identified with the field and laboratory methods. An error analysis
   indicates that adsorption of water and sediment into the PPE adds as
   much as 4\% to the measured oil masses and that uncertainties in the
   calculated sample volume and the assumed oil density introduce an
   additional +/- 3\% error when the masses are converted to fluid
   contents.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of dissolved organic carbon as present in landfill leachate,
   on the sorption of organic micropollutants in aquifer materials was
   studied by laboratory batch and column experiments involving 15
   non-polar organic chemicals, 5 landfill leachates and 4 aquifer
   materials of low organic carbon content.  The experiments showed that
   hydrophobic organic micropollutants do partition into dissolved organic
   carbon found in landfill leachate potentially increasing their mobility.
   However, landfill leachate interacted with aquifer materials apparently
   increases the sorbent affinity for the hydrophobic micropollutants.  The
   combination of these two mechanisms affected the observed distribution
   coefficients within a factor of two, in some cases increasing and in
   other cases decreasing the sorption of the chemicals.  No means for
   prediction of the effect is currently available, but from a practical
   point of view, the effect of landfill leachate on retardation of organic
   micropollutants in aquifer material seems limited.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of experiments were conducted to assess the potential for
   enhancing the in situ biodegradation of nine aromatic hydrocarbons in
   anaerobic, leachate-impacted aquifers at North Bay, Ontario, and at
   Canada Forces Base Borden.
   Laboratory microcosms containing authentic aquifer material and
   groundwater from the North Bay site were amended with nitrate and
   glucose.  No significant losses of aromatic hydrocarbons were observed
   compared to unamended controls, over a period of 187 days.
   A total of eight in situ biodegradation columns were installed in the
   North Bay and Borden aquifers.  Remedial additions included electron
   acceptors (nitrate and sulphate) and primary substrates (acetate,
   lactate and yeast extract).  Six aromatic hydrocarbons {[}toluene,
   ethylbenzene, m-xylene, o-xylene, cumene and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene
   (1,2,4-TMB)] were completely degraded in at least one in situ column at
   the North Bay site.  Only toluene was degraded in the Borden aquifer. 
   In all cases, aromatic hydrocarbon attenuation was attributed to
   biodegradation by methanogenic and fermentative bacteria.  No evidence
   of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation was observed in columns remediated
   with nitrate or primary substrates.
   A continuous forced gradient injection experiment with sulphate addition
   was conducted at the North Bay site over a period of 51 days.  The
   concentration of six aromatic hydrocarbons was monitored over time in
   the injection wells and at piezometer fences located 2, 5 and 10 m
   downgradient.  All compounds except toluene reached injection
   concentration between 14 and 26 days after pumping began, and showed
   some evidence of selective retardation.  Toluene broke through at a
   subdued concentration (approximately 50\% of injection levels), and
   eventually declined to undetectable levels on day 43.  This attenuation
   was attributed to adaptation and biodegradation by anaerobic bacteria.
   The results from these experiments indicate that considerable anaerobic
   biodegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons in landfill leachate plumes does
   occur.  The acclimatized population rapidly biodegraded toluene, much
   more rapidly than reported in other laboratory studies.  This
   biodegradation is selective, at least in the time frame of our
   experiments, with benzene and chlorobenzene remaining recalcitrant.}},

   (dichlorobenzene, naphthalene, tetrachloroethene and p-xylene) and three
   aquifer materials having low organic-carbon contents (0.02-0.1\%).  The
   results of the experiments were analyzed by using a one-dimensional
   advective-dispersive transport model, wherein sorption is considered
   instantaneous for a fraction of the sorbent and rate-limited for the
   remainder.  An inverse relationship between the reverse sorption rate
   constant and the equilibrium sorption constant was evident for each of
   two velocities.  However, there was an order-of-magnitude difference
   between the rate constants obtained at the two velocities.  This
   suggests the existence of a time-scale effect, which must be accounted
   for when modeling the transport of organic solutes.}},

Abstract = {{A low-molecular-weight dialysis membrane was used to exclude colloidal
   ferric oxyhydroxide solids with molecular weights of > 6000-8000 daltons
   from a portion of an anaerobic ferric/ferrous chloride solution.  Redox
   potential measurements taken in the presence and absence of colloidal
   ferric solids agree within +/- 7 mV, indicating that ferric colloids of
   this size are redox inactive.  Experiments conducted under varying
   solid/aqueous ferric ratios also indicate that ferric solids do not
   contribute exchange current density and are therefore inactive.  In
   spite of tabulated exchange currents which indicate stable potentials
   require greater-than-or-equal-to 10(-5) M Fe3+, stable electrode
   response was seen in solutions as dilute as 10(-6) M Fe3+.  Differences

Abstract = {{Biotransformation of organic pollutants is often most effective and
   complete under oxic or oxidant-rich conditions. Dissolved oxygen
   availability is frequently limiting the biotransformation of these
   organic compounds in the subsurface due to the limited aqueous
   solubility of oxygen, the relatively slow rate of re-aeration of
   groundwater in the saturated zone, and the significant biological oxygen
   demand exerted during aerobic metabolism. Addition of hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2) can augment the oxidant capacity of the aquifer. This paper
   reviews several reactions pertinent to remediating contaminated
   groundwaters via H2O2 addition. H2O2 is disproportionated by the action
   of microbial catalase and several inorganic catalysts such as iron oxide
   species to give 0.5 mol O2 per mole of H2O2 consumed. The resulting
   dissolved oxygen should then be available for microbial respiration. If
   disproportionation occurs too quickly evolution of oxygen gas can form
   bubbles that lower aquifer permeability. Another type of reaction is
   direct oxidation of organic compounds by H2O2 in the presence of enzymes
   (peroxidases) or metal oxide catalysts. Molecular oxygen is not evolved
   as a result of this type of H2O2-consuming reaction. Modifications in
   treatment strategy may also be necessary to minimize H2O2 toxicity as
   H2O2 is known to be toxic at a concentration within the cell of 0.1 mM.}},

Abstract = {{A published hysteretic saturation-pressure (S-P) model, which predicts
   fluid distributions before and after subsurface contamination by a
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL), is tested. To accomplish this, two-phase
   air-water and three-phase air-NAPL-water S-P measurements are conducted
   in two dissimilar porous media using a specially designed apparatus.
   Experimental boundary conditions are imposed to investigate hysteretic
   S-P scanning path behavior. Analysis of the data shows that fluid
   contents are not a unique function of capillary pressures; they are also
   a function of saturation path history (i.e. history-dependent movement
   of fluid interfaces through porous media). Close agreement is found
   between the experimental measurements and those calculated when the
   model was calibrated to the data. These results suggest that employing
   nonhysteretic S-P relations in computer codes to predict subsurface
   fluid distributions are likely to be inaccurate. In this paper the first
   version of the S-P model and a later amendment are outlined and
   consolidated.}},

Abstract = {{Geostatistical simulation and groundwater modeling are combined to
   estimate the probability of exceeding a threshold contamination level an
   aquifer. The analysis is completed in three dimensions with two sources
   of uncertainty considered: initial plume characterization, and aquifer
   parameter estimation. Initial plume location and intensity are based on
   a limited number of borehole measurements. Conditional simulation is
   used to generate possible plume configurations which provide initial
   conditions for a groundwater model. Simultaneously, aquifer parameters
   are also simulated, and repeated running of the groundwater model
   provides a frequency distribution of contaminant level at a selected
   compliance surface and future time. The method has been tested at a
   low-level radioactive waste reprocessing facility. Numerical results
   show that the effect of uncertain initial plume characterization may
   have a larger impact on the modeling process than the effect of
   uncertain aquifer parameters. Both effects should be considered in order
   to evaluate the need for additional aquifer remediation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of artificial fractures on colloidal transport
   in laboratory sand columns. Fractures were simulated by inserting small
   (0.2- or 1-mm-diam) tubes of controlled length and density into a sand
   column with dimensions 5-cm-diam by 65-cm-length. We injected
   1-mu-m-diam fluorescent microspheres, bacteria, and colloidal organic
   matter into columns with tubes and columns without tubes.
   Breakthrough curves were analyzed using an equilibrium transport model
   to obtain values for percent retention, retardation, and dispersivity.
   Fractures significantly increased the amount of microsphere transport;
   80-99\% of the spheres were retained in experiments with tubes inserted
   compared to 99-100\% without tubes. Bacteria used in this particular
   experiment had a lower percent retention (increased transport), 73\%
   with tubes and 93\% retention without tubes. Colloidal organic matter
   had 34\% retention with tubes and 55\% retention without tubes.
   Microspheres travelled faster than a conservative salt tracer
   (retardation factor < 1), probably caused by exclusion of travel at
   slower velocities in the matrix. This effect was enhanced when tubes
   were present. In some experiments, the tubes created multiple flow paths
   manifest in irregular rather than smooth breakthrough curves. There was
   no measurable difference in dispersion for the ``fractured{''} versus
   the ``unfractured{''} system.
   The retention coefficient was determined by sectioning the column at the
   end of the experiment and counting the number of microspheres retained
   in sections along the column. The exponential retention rate for spheres
   was on the order of 0.1 cm-1, with no measurable variation between sand
   columns with and without tubes. This retention coefficient is needed for
   models to predict colloid transport.
   In addition to providing parameter values for models, these observations
   have implications for monitoring colloid transport in natural systems.
   It is necessary to consider the possibility of travel faster than a
   conservative tracer, irregular breakthrough curves, and irreversible
   retention when sampling for colloids.}},

Abstract = {{The problems of eutrophication through nutrient enrichment and
   contamination with persistent contaminants have traditionally been
   regarded as unrelated by water scientists and managers, but recently
   evidence has appeared suggesting that the fate of organic contaminants
   in an aquatic ecosystem is influenced by the trophic state of the
   system. There is also evidence that the dissolved organic matter in
   dystrophic, or humic, waters may influence contaminant dynamics.
   Mechanisms that may be involved include changes in the metabolic
   capabilities of organisms with changes in trophic state; reductive
   degradation in the anoxic hypolimnia of highly productive waters;
   binding of contaminants by dissolved organic matter or organisms, or
   photochemical degradation induced by light-absorbing molecules. The
   possible significance of these processes is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Presented is a review of recent advances in the chemistry of abiotic
   redox transformations of organic pollutants in anaerobic ecosystems. The
   goal is to provide an indication of the state of knowledge and the
   remaining difficulties, rather than an exhaustive review of the existing
   literature. Particular attention is given to the types of functional
   groups that undergo reaction and the findings concerning physical and
   chemical parameters of ecosystems that govern the rates and products of
   redox transformations. Classes of compounds and structural features
   within these classes of compounds provide information about the
   intrinsic nature of the natural reductants. Further information is
   provided by studies which consider system variables such as sediment
   concentrations, organic carbon levels, pH, Eh and temperature. While the
   identity of reducing agents that transform organic pollutants in
   anaerobic systems remains elusive, the reactivities of these agents are
   being characterized and compared with surrogate (model) reductants. It
   is apparent that chemical and biological reduction processes are
   strongly coupled, and there is increasing evidence for widespread
   mediation of reductive reactions by bio-organic molecules.}},

Year = {{1992}},

Abstract = {{The effect of particle size, mineralogy and sediment organic carbon
   (SOC) on sorption of tetrachlorobenzene and pentachlorobenzene was
   evaluated using batch-isotherm experiments on sediment particle-size and
   mineralogical fractions from a sand and gravel aquifer, Cape Cod,
   Massachusetts. Concentration of SOC and sorption of chlorobenzenes
   increase with decreasing particle size. For a given particle size, the
   magnetic fraction has a higher SOC content and sorption capacity than
   the bulk or non-magnetic fractions. Sorption appears to be controlled by
   the magnetic minerals, which comprise only 5-25\% of the bulk sediment.
   Although SOC content of the bulk sediment is < 0.1\%, the observed
   sorption of chlorobenzenes is consistent with a partition mechanism and
   is adequately predicted by models relating sorption to the octanol/water
   partition coefficient of the solute and SOC content. A conceptual model
   based on preferential association of dissolved organic matter with
   positively-charged mineral surfaces is proposed to describe micro-scale,
   intergranular variability in sorption properties of the aquifer
   sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Preparative isolation and fractionation procedures coupled with
   spectrometric analyses were used to identify surfactant-derived
   contaminants in sewage effluent and sewage-contaminated groundwater from
   a site located on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Anionic surfactants and their
   biodegradation intermediates were isolated from field samples by ion
   exchange and fractionated by solvent extraction and adsorption
   chromatography. Fractions were analyzed by C-13 nuclear magnetic
   resonance spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.
   Carboxylated residues of alkylphenol polyethoxylate surfactants were
   detected in sewage effluent and contaminated groundwater. Linear
   alkylbenzenesulfonates (LAS) were identified in sewage effluent and
   groundwater. Groundwater LAS composition suggested preferential removal
   of select isomers and homologs due to processes of biodegradation and
   partitioning. Tetralin and indane sulfonates (DATS). alicyclic analogs
   of LAS, were also identified in field samples. Although DATS are a minor
   portion of LAS formulations, equivalent concentrations of LAS and DATS
   in groundwater suggested persistence of alicyclic contaminant structures
   over those of linear structure. Sulfophenyl-carboxylated (SPC) LAS
   biodegradation intermediates were determined in sewage effluent and
   groundwater. Homolog distributions suggested that SPC containing 3-10
   alkyl-chain carbons persist during infiltration and groundwater
   transport. Surfactant-derived residues detected in well F300-50
   groundwater have a minimum residence time in the range of 2.7-4.6 yr.
   LAS detected in groundwater at 500 m from infiltration has been stable
   over an estimated 50-500 half lives.}},

Abstract = {{Terpenes are produced abundantly by environmental processes but are
   found in very low concentrations in natural waters. Aqueous photolysis
   of solutions containing alpha-pinene, a representative terpene, in the
   presence of humic acid resulted in degradation of the pinene. Comparison
   of this reaction to photolysis of alpha-pinene in the presence of
   methylene blue leads to the conclusion that the reactive pathway for the
   abiotic degradation of alpha-pinene is due to reaction with singlet
   oxygen produced by irradiation of the humic material. The initial
   product of singlet oxygen and alpha-pinene is a hydroperoxide. Since
   humic materials are prevalent in most natural waters, this mechanism of
   photodecomposition for alpha-pinene probably also applies to other
   terpenes in surface waters and may be reasonably considered to
   contribute to their low environmental concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Associations of free-living bacteria (FLB) and dissolved organic
   contaminants in a 4-km-long plume of sewage-contaminated groundwater
   were investigated. Abundance of FLB in the core of the plume (as
   delineated by maximum specific conductance) steadily decreased in the
   direction of flow from a point 0.25 km downgradient from the source to
   the toe of the plume. At 0.25 km downgradient, FLB comprised up to 31\%
   of the total bacterial population, but constituted < 7\% of the
   population at 2 km downgradient. Abundance of FLB correlated strongly (r
   = 0.80, n = 23) with total dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in
   contaminated groundwater between 0.64 and 2.1 km downgradient, although
   distributions of individual contaminants such as di-, tri- and
   tetrachloroethene were highly variable, and their association with FLB
   less clear. Numbers of FLB in the downgradient portion of the plume
   which is contaminated with branched-chain alkylbenzenesulfonate (ABS)
   surfactants were low (< 5 . 10(8)/L) in spite of relatively high levels
   of DOC (up to 4 mg/L). However, abundance of FLB correlated strongly
   with non-surfactant DOC along vertical transects through the plume. The
   ratio of FLB to DOC and the ratio of FLB to attached bacteria generally
   decreased in the direction of flow and, consequently, with the age of
   the organic contaminants.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal variations of the photolysis rates of 2-chlorophenol in
   some Japanese natural waters were investigated using solar-simulated
   radiation. The direct photolysis rate constants and the indirect
   photolysis rate constants were separately obtained. In a eutrophic lake
   water, indirect photolysis occurred during spring, summer and fall. The
   average contribution of indirect photolysis to the overall photolysis
   was approximately 17\%. In an oligotrophic lake water, indirect
   photolysis apparently occurred only in summer and direct photolysis was
   depressed in other seasons. The correlation between the first-order rate
   constant for indirect photolysis and COD by the permanganate method was
   poor in both lake waters. The contribution of singlet oxygen route
   decomposition to the indirect photolysis in eutrophic water was
   approximately 10\% in summer. In seawater, indirect photolysis occurred
   during spring, summer and fall. The average contribution of indirect
   photolysis to the overall photolysis was approximately 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{Metal removal processes from acid mine drainage were studied in an
   experimental constructed wetland in the Idaho Springs-Central City
   mining district of Colorado. The wetland was designed to passively
   remove heavy metals from the mine drainage flowing from the Big Five
   Tunnel. Concurrent studies were performed in the field on the waters
   flowing from the wetland and in the laboratory on the wetland substrate.
   Both studies suggest that there is competition for organic adsorption
   sites among Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn. Iron and Cu appear to be more strongly
   adsorbed than Zn and Mn. The adsorption of metals varies with the
   fluctuation of pH in the outflow water. Also indicated by field and
   laboratory studies is the microbial reduction of sulfate with a
   corresponding increase in the sulfide concentration of the water. As
   sulfide is generated, Cu and Zn are completely removed. The field
   results suggest that upon start up of a constructed wetland, the
   adsorption of dissolved metals onto organic sites in the substrate
   material will be an important process. Over time, sulfide precipitation
   becomes the dominant process for metal removal from acid mine drainage.}},

Abstract = {{Kinetics of quinoline biodegradation, sorption and desorption in a
   clay-coated model soil containing a quinoline-degrading bacterium.
   Studies were initiated to compare the kinetics of quinoline
   sorption/desorption and biodegradation in order to predict the relative
   importance of abiotic and biotic processes in the transport of quinoline
   in columns containing a model soil. Initial biodegradation studies were
   conducted in a 1-cm-long column containing a quinoline-degrading
   bacterium (10(9) colony-forming units g-1 porous medium) attached to
   100- to 150-mu-m-diameter glass beads that did not sorb quinoline. At a
   155-nmol mL-1 quinoline influent concentration, the maximum consumption
   rate was 104.7 nmol quinoline min-1 cm-3 pore volume. In contrast, the
   maximum consumption rate of the first metabolite (2-hydroxyquinoline)
   was 24.8 nmol mL-1 cm-3 pore volume. In a second experiment, bacteria
   were mixed with a model soil, consisting of montmorillonite bound to
   alumina particles (75- to 180-mu-m diameter). In a 1-cm-long column of
   the model soil, the quinoline consumption rate at a 155-nmol mL-1
   quinoline influent concentration was similar to that obtained in the
   glass-bead column, showing that the clay does not substantially affect
   quinoline biodegradation at equilibrium conditions. In a third series of
   experiments, sorption to the model soil was examined in the absence of
   microorganisms. The observed desorption rate coefficient for quinoline
   averaged 1.1 . 10(-3) s-1, which was one to three orders of magnitude
   smaller than was observed for Ca-45. The slow ion exchange of quinoline
   on the clay surface is controlled by a site-specific
   quinoline/montmorillonite interaction and not a larger-scale physical
   step (i.e. interparticle diffusion). Equilibrium first-order forward
   (sorption) and reverse (desorption) mass fluxes were 1160 nmol cm-1 cm-3
   pore volume with a 155-nmol mL-1 quinoline influent concentration. The
   initial quinoline mass flux to the clay was estimated as 31,800 nmol
   cm-1 cm-3 pore volume. Thus, under the experimental conditions, the net
   rate of decrease of solution-phase quinoline is greater through abiotic
   processes than through biodegradation.
   Coefficients obtained from the individual sorption and biodegradation
   experiments were used in a sorption/biodegradation transport model to
   quantify any sorption/biodegradation interactions. Breakthrough of
   quinoline occurred more rapidly in the sorption/biodegradation
   experiments. indicating substantially less sorption compared to sorption
   experiments, Quinoline sorption was reduced a small amount due to
   competitive sorption between quinoline and 2-hydroxyquinoline
   (biodegradation intermediate), but this effect was too small to account
   for the substantial decrease in quinoline sorption. Experimental and
   calculated estimates of biomass coverage on the particles also accounted
   for some decrease in quinoline sorption, but not the large decrease
   observed. Therefore other, undefined, processes may contribute to the
   observed sorption/biodegradation interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Water samples collected from eight sampling points, representing upper,
   mid- and downstream regions, of the Tama River were treated with
   chlorine in the laboratory under conditions similar to those used for
   water renovation, in order to characterize and determine the halogenated
   organics formed in this reaction. Prior to treatment in the laboratory,
   river water showed total trihalomethanes (THM's) and non-purgeable total
   organic halogen (NPTOX) levels ranging from 0.4 to 12.2-mu-g/L (mean
   value, 4.1-mu-g/L) and from 7.1 to 42.3-mu-g/L (mean value,
   25.9-mu-g/L), respectively.
   Laboratory studies showed that the concentrations and compositions of
   halogenated organic compounds in chlorine-treated river waters are
   strongly dependent on the sampling points and sampling times. The ranges
   of total THM's and NPTOX levels in the laboratory chlorinated river
   waters were from 2 to 158-mu-g/L (mean value, 3-mu-g/L) and 12 to
   400-mu-g/L (mean value, 150-mu-g/L), respectively. Higher ratios of
   brominated THM's to total THM's were found in water samples taken from
   mid- and downstream regions.
   Higher concentrations of halogenated organic compounds were also
   produced upon chlorination of water samples collected from the midstream
   region during warmer seasons, while lower levels were observed for
   cooler-season samples. A contribution from the biodegradation of organic
   compounds in aqueous environments by microorganisms to the production of
   halogenated organic compounds on chlorination is suggested by this
   study.}},

Abstract = {{The Mississippi River and its major tributaries transport herbicides and
   their degradation products from agricultural areas in the mid-western
   U.S.A. These compounds include atrazine and its degradation products

   and alachlor and its degradation products
   (2-chloro-2',6'-diethylacetanilide, 2-hydroxy-2',6'-diethylacetanilide
   and 2,6-diethylaniline). These compounds were identified and confirmed
   by gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Loads of these
   compounds were determined during five sampling trips in 1987-1989.
   Stream loads of these compounds indicated that atrazine and metolachlor
   were relatively conservative in downstream transport. Alachlor and its
   degradation products were generated from point and non-point sources.
   Seasonal variations and hydrologic conditions controlled the loads or
   these compounds in the Mississippi River. Cross-channel mixing was slow
   downstream from major river confluences. possibly requiring several
   hundred kilometers of downriver transit for completion. The annual
   transport of these compounds into the Gulf of Mexico was estimated to be
   < 2\% of the annual application of each herbicide in the Midwest.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology for determining nutrient transformation pathways in
   rivers is described in this paper: (1) we measured the variation of
   nutrient concentrations continuously at upstream and downstream stations
   of a river section, together with the flow rate and the suspended
   sediment concentration; (2) we constructed a model that contains all
   pathways of the nutrient transformation, and (3) we determined the model
   parameter values so as to fit the observed data, by using computer
   simulations and mathematical programming methods. The best algorithm for
   the parameter determination is the modified Powell method. However, when
   the CPU time is critical, the BFGS variable metric method is recommeded.
   The river model has many parameters, but when the observed data have had
   ``sufficient fluctuation{''}, still nine parameters can be determined in
   one trial. Even if the model has errors in its basic equations, the
   determined transformation loads are comparable to real transformation
   loads when data have had ``sufficient fluctuation{''}. Even if sediment
   amount data are not available, the correct parameter can be determined
   by adding the initial sediment amount into parameters for determination.
   This method was applied to several rivers, and it determined the total
   mass transfer in each river successfully.}},

Abstract = {{Photooxidation of substituted phenols in the presence of flavins as
   sensitizers was investigated under aerobic conditions to determine the
   fate of synthetic chemicals in the environment. Riboflavin was easily
   decomposed: lumichrome formed after several minutes of illumination with
   simulated sunlight. In contrast, lumichrome was extremely stable toward
   sunlight, and was found to be a major flavin component in natural water.
   From the result of the lumichrome-sensitized photodecomposition of
   substituted phenols, the order of photolysis rate is p-methoxyphenol >
   p-chlorophenol > phenol > p-nitrophenol. A decrease in total organic
   carbon (TOC) from the reaction solutions of all phenols except for
   p-nitrophenol was observed, and the carbon released was found to mainly
   originate from phenols. The compound p-chlorophenol has been shown to
   degrade readily by lumichrome-sensitized photooxidation, but the
   transformation occurs only by dechlorination. Polychlorophenols were
   completely dechlorinated in approximately 1 hr after
   lumichrome-sensitized photolysis, and the rate increased with chlorine

Abstract = {{Mass balance models were developed to examine how monitoring well
   purging influences the collection of representative ground water
   samples.  Modeling indicates that monitoring wells may provide only
   qualitative information on the absolute and relative abundances of
   solutes in ground water.  Solute concentrations in a purged well may
   vary by over an order of magnitude depending on well construction,
   purging procedure, vertical concentration distributions of solutes in
   the ground water and the hydrogeological properties of the aquifer. 
   Further, these dependencies limit setting a priori criteria for purging,
   using simple field measurements for monitoring purging completeness, and
   extrapolating the results of empirical purging studies.  Water samples
   obtained from typical monitoring wells using standard purging procedures
   may underestimate ground water contamination by orders of magnitude. 
   Mass balance effects that occur during purging can complicate the
   interpretation of physical, chemical and biological conditions and
   processes occuring within an aquifer.  Recognising that solute
   concentrations are likely to vary in three dimensions, the quantitative
   assessment of ground water requires sampling at discrete depths within
   an aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The mass balance model simulations in Part I indicated that contaminant
   concentration data from typical ground water monitoring wells are
   inherently biased by mixing and averaging effects.  This paper presents
   the results of field purging studies conducted at a site of subsurface
   gasoline contamination to test the mass balance purging model and to
   verify composite averaging effects.  Samples collected from wells with
   different screen lengths, and from multi-level sampling pipes within
   both the aquifer and the sand pack of two wells provided data that
   confirmed mass balance inferences.  The concentrations of aromatic
   contaminants and other water quality parameters in the monitoring wells
   depended on:  (1) the well screen length; (2) the water levels achieved
   in the well during purging (as well as the volume of water purged); (3)
   when the well was sampled during water level recovery (as opposed to
   sampling method); (4) sand pack characteristics; and (5) vertical
   concentration variations in the ground water.  The study also revealed
   that post-purging well concentrations underestimated ground water
   contamination by orders of magnitude due to composite averaging.  These
   results indicate that typical monitoring wells provide only qualitative
   contaminant information, irrespective of how the wells are purged. 
   Consequently, contaminant data collected from typical monitoring wells
   may only have limited value with respect to delineating, modeling and
   remediating contaminant plumes.  As predicted by the mass balance model
   simulations in Part I and verified by this field study, water samples
   must be collected at discrete depths to quantitatively delineate ground
   water contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Finite-difference and finite-element methods of approximation have been
   extended to solve the one-dimensional nonlinear partial differential
   equations that describe the simultaneous transport of heat, moisture and
   chemical in the unsaturated zone.  Especially for chemical transport,
   nodal spacing criteria are required to minimize numerical dispersion and
   oscillatory behavior in the solution vector for chemical concentration. 
   Conservative criteria for nodal spacing for saturated flow can be used
   to set nodal spacing for unsaturated zone transport.  When nodal spacing
   criteria are satisfied, for the same set of transport and boundary
   conditions, chemical concentration profiles calculated by the two
   numerical methods will be almost the same.  A situation that is
   simulated very well with one-dimensional models, is the application of
   chemicals to land surfaces.  To compare and contrast the characteristics
   of solutions given by the two numerical methods, moisture content,
   temperature and chemical concentration profiles for a 75-day period
   after application in the unsaturated zone are calculated for two
   representative types of organic chemicals.  In the first, the chemical
   is very slowly degraded in the subsurface environment but strongly
   sorbed to soil surfaces.  In the second, the chemical is rapidly
   degraded but weakly sorbed to soil surfaces.  Because of differences in
   sorption coefficients and mechanisms of degradation, for the same set of
   hydrodynamic properties of the subsurface, the weakly sorbed chemical is
   more widely distributed throughout the unsaturated zone, whereas the
   strongly sorbed chemical stays very close to where it is put initially
   with little penetration into the subsurface.  Satisfying nodal spacing
   criteria minimizes the impact of the method of approximation on the
   calculated solutions of the transport equations.  For better model
   predictive performance, however, there are needs for more fundamental
   information on processes governing transport in the subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a numerical model for prediction
   of soil vapor extraction processes.  The major emphasis is placed on
   field-scale predictions with the objective to advance development of
   planning tools for design and operation of venting systems.  The
   numerical model solves two-dimensional flow and transport equations for
   general n-component contaminant mixtures.  Flow is limited to the gas
   phase and local equilibrium partitioning is assumed in tracking
   contaminants in the immiscible fluid, water, gas, and solid phase. 
   Model predictions compared favorably with analytical solutions and
   multicomponent column venting experiments.  Sensitivity analysis
   indicates equilibrium phase partitioning is a good assumption in
   modeling organic liquid volatilization occurring in field venting
   operations.  Mass transfer rates in volatilization from the water phase
   and contaminant desorption are potentially rate limiting.  Simulations
   of hypothetical field-scale problems show efficiency of venting
   operations is most sensitive to vapor pressure and the magnitude and
   distribution of soil permeability.}},

Abstract = {{Unsaturated- and saturated-zone field studies were conducted under two
   different agricultural conditions in Florida, U.S.A., to measure the
   movement and degradation of ethoprop.
   When ethoprop was applied to a sand soil in an orange grove located on
   the Florida central ridge, soil residues declined with a half-life of 13
   days to near the limit of detection (0.01-mu-g g-1 within 2 months. 
   Ethoprop residues were generally contained in the upper 2 m of soil. 
   Although low levels of ethoprop were found in four groundwater samples
   within the first 3 months after application, the cause of these isolated
   and transient residues could not be determined.  The data show that
   there was no widespread plume of ethoprop residues beneath or
   downgradient from the treated area.
   On a flatwood soil on the west coast of Florida, ethoprop was
   incorporated into raised beds and protected by a plastic mulch in which
   tomatoes were grown.  When the plastic mulch was present, ethoprop soil
   residues declined with a half-life of approximately 40 days and were
   confined to the upper 0.3 m of soil.  After the mulch was removed at
   crop harvest, the remaining ethoprop dissipated with a half-life of
   approximately 12 days.  Groundwater residues in excess of 1-mu-g L-1
   were confined to a single sample collected after the well had been
   damaged during a rototilling operation.  Resides of < 1-mu-g L-1 were
   present in three later samples from this well.  At the sampling interval
   where the highest residues were detected in the damaged well, ethoprop
   residues of < 1-mu-g L-1 were also found in three other wells but no
   residues were detected in these wells in later samples.}},

Abstract = {{Breakthrough curves (BTC's) of five phthalate esters (PE's) and chloride
   as a tracer were measured during unsaturated, steady water flow
   conditions on two undisturbed soil columns with different organic carbon
   contents (OC). Two conceptual models, the local equilibrium assumption
   (LEA) model and the physical nonequilibrium (PNE) model, were used to
   simulate the observed BTC's. The unknown parameters for the two models
   were estimated either by fitting model predictions to the experimental
   data, or, if possible, by independent measurements. Results of the
   tracer BTC's indicate that for the soil with the lower organic content
   the local equilibrium assumption was valid, whereas for the more
   aggregated soil, with higher OC, physical nonequilibrium existed. For
   the PE's an incomplete mass-balance was observed which increased with
   increasing hydrophobicity of the PE's and which was greater for the soil
   with the higher OC. Since microbiological degradation of the PE's was
   hindered, it cannot be the major cause for this mass deficit.
   Consequently, it is partly attributed to a chemical nonequilibrium,
   which is due to slow diffusion of the contaminants into the organic
   matrix of the soil and a possible subsequent entrapment of these
   substances in the organic matter. When modeling the PE BTC's, it was
   necessary to introduce a non-zero degradation term to account for this
   nonequilibrium. For the soil with the lower OC the LEA-model described
   well the measured BTC's for the PE's. When independently measured
   parameter values for the other soil were used, the LEA-model failed to
   describe any of the observed BTC's whereas good agreement between
   measured and calculated data was reached with the PNE-model.}},

Abstract = {{Immiscible organic liquids may be extracted from moist soil or other
   hydrophilic porous media by shaking a suspension of water and soil in a
   glass jar with a piece of porous polyethylene. The water displaces the
   organic liquid from the predominantly hydrophilic sample and the
   hydrophobic polyethylene preferentially absorbs the organic liquid,
   excluding water unless there is a detergent associated with the organic.
   Because most soils have some hydrophobic surfaces, the extraction of
   organic liquids by displacement with water is not quite complete. A
   correction is therefore made in the assay method by including samples
   with known organic liquid content as controls. The amount of organic
   liquid not displaced from the control samples can also be used to
   indicate the extent of hydrophobic sites in predominantly water-wet
   porous media. Organic liquid extractions were made by using three soils
   and two organic liquids. The standard deviation among replicated
   extractions was 0.010 g organic liquid. By applying a correction to the
   mass of organic liquid recovered, the assay accuracy was +/- 0.001 g
   organic liquid/g soil with 20.0-g oven-dry soil samples. It is likely
   that this assay method could be scaled up and used as a remediation
   method for removing and recovering organic liquids from earth excavated

Abstract = {{The rate and magnitude of contaminant release from mill tailings to
   groundwater are known to depend on the form and mineralogy of the host
   grains. Using samples from three uranium mill sites in the western
   United States, we identified four types of alpha-emitting host grains -
   those containing barium-strontium sulfates, authigenic siliceous
   material, uranium minerals, and iron-titanium-vanadium oxides. These
   four grain types constitute a classification scheme for the tailings.
   Each milling process (acid or alkaline) produces distinct types of
   grains. In acid-milled tailings, such as those at Slick Rock, Colorado,
   the dominant source of alpha-emissions is from barium-strontium sulfate.
   The barium-to-strontium ratio covers the entire solid-solution range
   between barite and celestite. In alkaline-milled tailings,
   alpha-emissions come predominantly from siliceous composite grains,
   which are interpreted as grains from the mill feed that have been
   altered during milling. In the siliceous composite grains, radionuclides
   are encased by siliceous material resembling chalcedony. Other
   alpha-emitting grains appear to be unrelated to milling; some uranium
   minerals and iron-titanium-vanadium oxides appear to have passed through
   the milling process relatively unaltered.
   The classification scheme identified in this study reflects the
   geochemical reactivity of the tailings with groundwater. Our findings
   can be used to improve confidence levels when predicting; (1) source
   loading to a groundwater system; (2) health effects from inhaled
   radioactive dust; and (3) long-term performance of uranium tailings
   containment cells.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical analysis is presented describing the equilibria and
   kinetics of the dissolution of organic components present in a
   non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contacted by groundwater. Expressions
   are derived for the concentration of these components in water as a
   function Of NAPL composition as it changes with time. Experimental
   laboratory ``generator column{''} data are presented in support of the
   theory employing synthetic hydrocarbon and chlorinated hydrocarbon
   mixtures and crude oils. It is suggested that the ``generator column{''}
   technique is a valuable experimental approach for investigating the
   dissolution characteristics of NAPLS.}},

Abstract = {{The present study shows that equations of the two-site kinetic model,
   which have been applied to trace-metal and pesticide adsorption to soil,
   could also be used to simulate diffusion-controlled adsorption behaviour
   of Co-60 and Cs-137 to rock powder (diameter less than 105 x 10(-6)m),
   pieces (diameter 2 x 10(-3)m approximately 3 x 10(-3)m) and slabs (0.05
   m x 0.05 m x 0.01 m) of chert, shale and granodiorite in saline water.
   The adsorption rate coefficient was dependent on sizes of rocks and rock
   pore structures but was independent of distribution coefficients. The
   desorption rate coefficient was dependent on sizes of rocks, rock pore
   structures and distribution coefficients. The difference in adsorption
   and desorption rate coefficients between rock powder, pieces, and slabs
   was zero to two orders of magnitude for Cs-137 and zero to three orders
   of magnitude for Co-60.
   Theoretical relationships between parameters of the two-site kinetic
   model and the Fickian diffusion model were also developed. Effective
   diffusion coefficients could be evaluated from the fitted rate parameter
   values of the two-site kinetic model. Observed characteristics of rate
   parameters agreed well with the theoretical equation.
   Dependence of adsorption and desorption rate coefficients and
   equilibrium distribution coefficient of Cs-137 and Co-60 on solid to
   liquid ratios were insignificant for rock powder.
   Applying rate parameter values obtained in this study to field
   conditions, it was concluded that kinetics of adsorption may often
   become important in predicting field-scale solute transport.}},

Abstract = {{Effluent from septic tank-drainfields can degrade groundwater quality
   and contaminate nearby water-supply wells. Such groundwater
   contamination is a problem in the unsewered subdivisions of the sand
   plain of central Wisconsin, for example. To help planners minimize the
   risk of direct contamination of a water-supply well by a septic system,
   a model was developed to estimate the location of the critical dividing
   pathline between a rectangular contaminant source (the septic tank
   drainfield) and a partially penetrating pumping well. The model is
   capable of handling three-dimensional, transient flow in an unconfined,
   homogeneous, anisotropic aquifer of infinite areal extent, under a
   regional horizontal hydraulic gradient.
   Model results are in very good agreement with several other numerical
   and analytical models. Examples are given for which the safe, horizontal
   and vertical separation distances to avoid well water contamination are
   determined for typical central Wisconsin sand plain conditions. A
   companion paper (Harmsen et al., 1991) describes the application of this
   model, using a Monte-Carlo analysis, to study the variation of these
   separation distances in the Wisconsin sand plain. The model can also be
   applied to larger scale problems and, therefore, could be useful in
   implementing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's new well head
   protection program.}},

Abstract = {{Using a three-dimensional groundwater-contaminant tracking model a
   number of Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to estimate the mean
   and standard deviations of the separation distances and minimum well
   depth required to avoid contamination of a pumping water-supply well by
   a nearby septic tank-drainfield. The range of conditions simulated
   represent those found in the Central Wisconsin sand plain. A sensitivity
   analysis revealed that the separation distances and minimum well depth
   are most sensitive to variations in the horizontal hydraulic
   conductivity, anisotropy ratio and horizontal regional hydraulic
   gradient. The mean and standard deviations of the theoretical safe
   separation distances and safe well depth are presented as contour
   diagrams that can be used for design purposes. An example is given for
   which the design separation distances and minimum well depth are
   determined for a hypothetical subdivision in the Central Wisconsin sand
