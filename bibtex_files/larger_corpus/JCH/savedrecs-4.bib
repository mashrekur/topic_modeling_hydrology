Abstract = {{Three simple screening models of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)
   dissolution in the subsurface are proposed based on the NAPL mass
   conservation and the assumption of proportionality between the residual
   NAPL source zone concentration and the remaining residual NAPL mass. The
   purpose of the proposed models is to predict the solute concentration in
   the zone of the residual NAPL as a result of dissolution. The predicted
   source zone concentration decrease is used to simulate and account for
   the decrease of dissolution rate with time. The proposed simple NAPL
   dissolution models enable the pseudo-equilibrium formulation to be used
   and therefore the numerical simulations for field application problems
   can be simplified compared to the non-equilibrium counterpart. With
   proper choice of empirical parameters, the proposed simple screening
   models can work as well as more complex dissolution rate correlation
   models, such as that of Imhoff et al. {[}Water Resour. Res. 30 (1994)
   307-320]. It is found that the proposed models are very good for
   quantifying non-equilibrium dissolution, which is characterized by
   tailing of breakthrough curves. The models are especially useful for
   situations of small residual NAPL saturation, which are typical for many
   field applications. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of salt (KCI) flux through a 1-m-thick clay membrane barrier
   (CMB) based on coupled solute transport theory are compared to simulated
   fluxes based on traditional advective-dispersive transport theory. The
   simulations are based on measured values for the effective
   salt-diffusion coefficient (D-s{*}) and chemico-osmotic efficiency
   coefficient (omega) for a bentonite-based barrier material subjected to
   KC] solutions. The results indicate that the exit salt flux is reduced
   due to both explicit coupling (hyperfiltration and chemico-osmotic
   counter-advection) and an implicit coupling effect resulting from the
   decrease in D-s{*} due to a decrease in the apparent tortuosity factor,
   tau(a), with an increase in omega. Implicit coupling is shown to be more
   significant than explicit coupling for reducing and retarding salt flux
   through a CMB under diffusion-dominated conditions. Failure to account
   for the implicit coupling effect may result in unrealistic results, such
   as the existence of salt flux through a perfect (ideal) clay membrane
   (i.e., omega = 1). (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation of streams impacted by non-point source contaminants
   requires an understanding of both the areas within a watershed that are
   contributing contamination to streams and the pathways of contaminant
   migration to streams. From 1998 to 2002, we studied the migration of
   Sr-90 in the Borschi watershed, a small (8.5 km(2)) catchment three kin
   south of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine. Fuel particles,
   distributed in a heterogeneous pattern across the watershed, are
   weathering and releasing Sr-90 from the fuel matrix. Depletion of 90Sr,
   evaluated in comparison to the immobile fission product europium-154, is
   occurring in the channel and wetland sediment. Channel sediments are
   uniformly depleted in Sr-90 with depth. In wetland sediments, there is a
   zone of depletion in the top 10 cm and a zone of accumulation at depths
   from 10 to 25 cm. Estimates of Sr-90 depletion are used to map the
   effective source area that has contributed Sr-90 loading to the main
   channel. The effective source area includes channel bottom sediments, a
   wetland in the central region of the watershed, and periodically flooded
   soils surrounding the wetland. The total depletion from the effective
   source area is estimated to be 36 +/- 7 x 10(10) Bq. Based on
   observations of stream flow rate and water quality in 1999-2001, the
   annual Sr-90 removal rate from the watershed is estimated to be 1.4 +/-
   0.2 x 10(10) or 1.5\% of the inventory per year. When extrapolated over
   a 15-year period following the Chernobyl accident, the last value is in
   reasonable agreement with the estimated depletion of the source area
   based on Sr-90/Eu-154 ratios. The Sr-90 yearly leaching rate considering
   the whole watershed is 0.2\% while the Sr-90 leaching rate considering
   the effective source area is an order of magnitude higher. Most of the
   Sr-90 release in the watershed has originated from an effective source
   area of 0.62 km(2), or 7\% of the watershed area. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this work, we extend the recently developed gradient approach for
   surfactant-enhanced remediation of dense non-aqueous phase liquid
   (DNAPL)-impacted sites. The goal of the gradient approach is to maximize
   the DNAPL solubilization capacity in swollen micelles (Type I aqueous
   microemulsions) while at the same time minimizing the potential for
   DNAPL mobilization. In this work, we introduce a modified version of the
   capillary/trapping curve that we refer to as the gradient curve to help
   interpret and/or design the gradient approach. The gradient curve
   presents the residual DNAPL saturation as a function of interfacial
   tension and microemulsion viscosity. This approach demonstrates that
   keeping a low viscosity of the microemulsion phase is not only important
   for keeping a low head loss during surfactant flooding but also to
   prevent oil mobilization. Eight microemulsion systems were evaluated in
   this research; these systems were evaluated based on their
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE) solubilization capacity, interfacial tension
   (IFT), viscosity, density, and coalescence kinetics. Two of these
   systems were chosen for evaluation in site-specific column tests using
   an increasing electrolyte gradient to produce a decreasing
   IFT/increasing solubilization gradient system. The column studies were
   conducted with media from Dover Air Force Base in Dover, DE. Both
   solubilized and mobilized DNAPL were quantified. During the column
   studies, we observed that substantial PCE was mobilized when the
   residual level of PCE in the column was significantly higher than the
   steady-state residual saturation level being approach (as predicted from
   the gradient curve). Four column studies were performed, three of which
   were used to asses the validity of the gradient curve in predicting the
   residual saturation after each gradient step. From these tests we
   observed that starting IFTs of less than 1 mN/m all produced the same
   mobilization potential. In the last column, we used an additional
   gradient step with an initial IFT above 1 mN/m to dramatically reduce
   the amount of PCE mobilize. Based on the good agreement between column
   results and projections based on the gradient curve, we propose this as
   a preferred method for designing gradient surfactant flushing systems.

Abstract = {{Enhanced understanding of light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL)
   infiltration into heterogeneous porous media is important for the
   effective design of remediation strategies. We used a 2-D experimental
   facility that allows for visual observation of LNAPL contours in order
   to study LNAPL redistribution in a layered porous medium. The layers are
   situated in the unsaturated zone near the watertable and they are
   inclined to be able to observe the effect of discontinuities in
   capillary forces and relative permeabilities. Two experiments were
   performed. The first experiment consisted of LNAPL infiltration into a
   fine sand matrix with a coarse sand layer, and the second experiment
   consisted of a coarse sand matrix and a fine sand layer. The numerical
   multi-phase flow model STOMP was validated with regard to the
   experimental results. This model is able to adequately reproduce the
   experimental LNAPL contours. Numerical sensitivity analysis was also
   performed. The capillarity contrast between sands was found to be the
   main controlling factor determining the final LNAPL distribution. (C)

Abstract = {{Cross-borehole ground penetrating radar (XBGPR) is used in monitoring a
   long-term vadose zone infiltration experiment at a test site in Socorro,
   NM in order to examine contaminant transport in the vadose zone. XBGPR
   attenuation tomography is conducted in order to test the ability of
   using images of electromagnetic attenuation for hydrogeologic
   investigations. The results of four preinfiltration attenuation
   inversions shows standard deviations below 0.1 Np/m, and demonstrate the
   consistency of the XBGPR tomography technique for making time-lapse
   observations. Correlation to the core records indicates that XBGPR
   attenuation tomograms provide high-resolution images of clay
   distribution in the vadose zone. Water infiltration at the ground
   surface was initiated in February 1999 at a constant rate of 2.7 cm/day,
   and continued at this rate throughout the data collection experiment.
   Time-lapse attenuation tomograms show that attenuation increases by
   approximately 0.3 Np/m during the water infiltration, and indicate a
   snowplow effect may be occurring where salts are dissolved by the water
   and concentrated at the front of the plume. Seasonal temperature changes
   may also cause changes in electromagnetic attenuation images, and
   masking the evidence of water infiltration. Thus caution must be taken
   when using time-lapse attenuation images to interpret the movement of a
   water plume during a long-term experiment as temperature changes. (C)

Abstract = {{The migration of Dense, Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (DNAPL) and dissolved
   phase contamination through a fractured heterogeneous porous medium has
   been investigated through the use of a multiphase compositional model.
   The sensitivity of the timescales of migration and the distribution of
   contaminant in the subsurface to the mean permeability, the variance of
   the permeability, and the degree of fracturing of the domain were
   examined. It was found that increasing the mean permeability of the
   domain allowed the DNAPL to penetrate deeper into the subsurface, while
   decreasing the mean permeability caused the DNAPL to pool at shallower
   depths. The presence of fractures within the system was found to control
   the infiltration only in the most fractured domain. Moment analysis of
   the nonwetting phase showed that large-scale movement had ceased after
   approximately 9 years (maximum duration of the source-on condition was
   approximately 4.5 years). This tended to be due to a redistribution of
   the DNAPL towards a residual configuration, as was evidenced by the
   gradual trending of average nonwetting phase saturations within the
   domain to a static value. The dissolved phase plume was found to migrate
   at essentially the same rate as the nonwetting phase, due to the reduced
   relative permeability of lenses containing DNAPL, and due to diffusive
   losses of mass to the matrix of fractured clay and silty-clay lenses.
   Some exceptions to this were found when the DNAPL could not overcome the
   displacement pressure of a lens, and could not by-pass the lens due to
   the lack of available driving force after the source had been shut off.

Abstract = {{Large amounts of Cs-137 have been accidentally released to the
   subsurface from the Hanford nuclear site in the state of Washington,
   USA. The cesium-containing liquids varied in ionic strengths, and often
   had high electrolyte contents, mainly in the form of NaNO3 and NaOH,
   reaching concentrations up to several moles per liter. In this study, we
   investigated the effect of ionic strengths on Cs migration through two
   types of porous media: silica sand and Hanford sediments. Cesium
   sorption and transport was studied in 1, 10, 100, and 1000 mM NaCl
   electrolyte solutions at pH 10. Sorption isotherms were constructed from
   batch equilibrium experiments and the batch-derived sorption parameters
   were compared with column breakthrough curves. Column transport
   experiments were analyzed with a two-site equilibrium-nonequilibrium
   model. Cesium sorption to the silica sand in batch experiments showed a
   linear sorption isotherm for all ionic strengths, which matched well
   with the results from the column experiments at 100 and 1000 mM ionic
   strength; however, the column experiments at 1 and 10 mM ionic strength
   indicated a nonlinear sorption behavior of Cs to the silica sand.
   Transport through silica sand occurred under one-site sorption and
   equilibrium conditions. Cesium sorption to Hanford sediments in both
   batch and column experiments was best described with a nonlinear
   Freundlich isotherm. The column experiments indicated that Cs transport
   in Hanford sediments occurred under two-site equilibrium and
   nonequilibrium sorption. The effect of ionic strength on Cs transport
   was much more pronounced in Hanford sediments than in silica sands.
   Effective retardation factors of Cs during transport through Hanford
   sediments were reduced by a factor of 10 when the ionic strength
   increased from 100 to 1000 mM; for silica sand, the effective
   retardation was reduced by a factor of 10 when ionic strength increased
   from 1 to 1000 mM. A two order of magnitude change in ionic strength was
   needed in the silica sand to observe the same change in Cs retardation

Abstract = {{In recent years, natural attenuation (NA) has evolved into a possible
   remediation alternative, especially in the case of BTEX spills. In order
   to be approved by the regulators, biodegradation needs to be
   demonstrated which requires efficient site investigation and monitoring
   tools. Three methods-the Integral Groundwater Investigation method, the
   compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) and a newly developed
   combination of both were used in this work to quantify at field scale
   the biodegradation of o-xylene at a former gasworks site which is
   heavily contaminated with BTEX and PAHs. First, the Integral Groundwater
   Investigation method {[}Schwarz, R., Ptak, T., Holder, T., Teutsch, G.,
   1998. Groundwater risk assessment at contaminated sites: a new
   investigation approach. In: Herbert, M. and Kovar, K. (Editors), GQ'98
   Groundwater Quality: Remediation and Protection. IAHS Publication 250,
   pp. 68-71; COH 4 (2000) 170] was applied, which allows the determination
   of mass flow rates of o-xylene by integral pumping tests. Concentration
   time series obtained during pumping at two wells were used to calculate
   inversely contaminant mass flow rates at the two control planes that are
   defined by the diameter of the maximum isochrone. A reactive transport
   model was used within a Monte Carlo approach to identify biodegradation
   as the dominant process for reduction in the contaminant mass flow rate
   between the two consecutive control planes. Secondly, compound-specific
   carbon isotope analyses of o-xylene were performed on the basis of
   point-scale samples from the same two wells. The Rayleigh equation was
   used to quantify the degree of biodegradation that occurred between the
   wells. Thirdly, a combination of the Integral Groundwater Investigation
   method and the compound-specific isotope analysis was developed and
   applied. It comprises isotope measurements during the integral pumping
   tests and the evaluation of delta(13)C time series by an inversion
   algorithm to obtain spatially integrated mean isotope values at the
   control planes. It was shown that the Rayleigh equation is applicable to
   spatially integrated mean isotope values in order to obtain the mean
   biodegradation between the consecutive control planes. All three
   approaches yielded consistently a 98-99\% degradation of o-xylene. (C)

Abstract = {{Forty-one phase diagrams and fifteen sand column experiments were
   conducted to evaluate the efficiency of three types of washing solutions
   to recover trichloroethylene (TCE) at residual saturation and to
   identify the recovery mechanisms involved. This study demonstrates that:
   (1) an alcohol and a surfactant combination is more efficient than an
   alcohol used alone in water; (2) the prediction of the dominant recovery
   mechanism from the tie line slopes in phase diagram is accurate and can
   be reproduced in sand column experiments; and (3) TCE recovery
   efficiency in sand column experiments is generally well represented by
   the position of the miscibility curve in phase diagrams in the low
   concentration range. However, the miscibility curve alone is not
   sufficient to exactly predict the TCE recovery mechanisms involved. Tie
   line slopes and the critical tie line have to be taken into
   consideration to select the active matter as well as its concentration
   and to predict the dominant recovery mechanism in sand column
   experiments. The sand column experiments quantified the recovery
   efficiency of each solution and identified the proportion of the
   recovery mechanisms (mobilisation vs. solubilisation). Washing solutions
   with an active matter concentration above the critical tie line caused
   dominating mobilisation. Mobilisation was also dominant when the active
   matter of the washing solution partitioned into the organic phase and
   the active matter concentration was below the critical tie line.
   Solubilisation and emulsification were dominant for washing solutions
   containing active matter, which principally partitioned into the aqueous
   phase and an active matter concentration below the critical tie line.

Abstract = {{The relative contributions of four mechanisms of oxygen transport in
   multilayer composite (MLC) caps placed over oxygen-consuming mine waste
   were evaluated using numerical and analytical methods. MLC caps are
   defined here as caps consisting of earthen and geosynthetic (polymeric)
   components where a composite barrier layer consisting of a geomembrane
   (1-2 mm thick polymeric sheet) overlying a clay layer is the primary
   barrier to transport. The transport mechanisms that were considered are
   gas-phase advective transport, gas-phase diffusive transport,
   liquid-phase advective transport via infiltrating precipitation and
   liquid-phase diffusive transport. A numerical model was developed to
   simulate gas-phase advective-diffusive transport of oxygen through a
   multilayer cap containing seven layers. This model was also used to
   simulate oxygen diffusion in the liquid phase. An approximate analytical
   method was used to compute the advective flux of oxygen in the liquid
   phase. The numerical model was verified for limiting cases using an
   analytical solution. Comparisons were also made between model
   predictions and field data for earthen caps reported by others. Results
   of the analysis show that the dominant mechanism for oxygen transport
   through MLC caps is gas-phase diffusion. For the cases that were
   considered, the gas-phase diffusive flux typically comprises at least
   99\% of the total oxygen flux. Thus, designers of MLC caps should focus
   on design elements and features that will limit diffusion of gas-phase
   oxygen. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent laboratory and field studies have shown that food-grade edible
   oils can be injected into the subsurface for installation of in-situ
   permeable reactive barriers. However to be effective, the oil must be
   distributed out away from the oil injection points without excessive
   permeability loss. In this work, we examine the distribution of soybean
   oil in representative aquifer sediments as non-aqueous phase liquid oil
   (NAPL oil) or as an oil-in-water emulsion. Laboratory columns packed
   with sands or clayey sands were flushed with either NAPL oil or a
   soybean emulsion followed by plain water, while monitoring permeability
   loss and the final oil residual saturation. NAPL oil can be injected
   into coarse-grained sands. However NAPL injection into finer grained
   sediments requires high injection pressures which may not be feasible at
   some sites. In addition, NAPL injection results in high oil residual
   saturations and moderate permeability losses. In contrast, properly
   prepared emulsions can be distributed through sands with varying clay
   content without excessive pressure buildup, low oil retention and very
   low to moderate permeability loss. For effective transport, the emulsion
   must be stable, the oil droplets must be significantly smaller than the
   mean pore size of the sediment and the oil droplets should have a low to
   moderate tendency to stick to each other and the aquifer sediments. In
   our work, oil retention and associated permeability toss increased with
   sediment clay content and with the ratio of droplet size to pore size.
   For sandy sediments, the permeability loss is modest (0-40\% loss) and
   is proportional to the oil residual saturation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model for the geometry of nonaqueous phase liquid
   (NAPL) pools and mounds in homogeneous soils and soils with discrete
   textural interfaces. It is shown that the concepts of capillary
   pressure-saturation curve hysteresis and entry pressures are integral to
   the complete conceptualization of pool and mound geometry. Unless
   hysteresis is included in the analysis, light NAPL (LNAPL) in
   homogeneous soils cannot exist in pools at all, and dense NAPL (DNAPL)
   will not mound on horizontal textural interfaces unless lateral
   confining boundaries are present. The proposed model also implies that
   remobilization of DNAPL pools will occur at lower hydraulic gradients
   than those predicted with previous models. Comparing predicted and
   experimental DNAPL and LNAPL pool thicknesses and the location of an
   LNAPL lens with respect to the top of the capillary fringe validate the
   model. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A hysteretic constitutive model describing relations among relative
   penneabilities, saturations, and pressures in fluid systems consisting
   of air, nonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL), and water is modified to account
   for NAPL that is postulated to be immobile in small pores and pore
   wedges and as films or lenses on water surfaces. A direct outcome of the
   model is prediction of the NAPL saturation that remains in the vadose
   zone after long drainage periods (residual NAPL). Using the modified
   model, water and NAPL (free, entrapped by water, and residual)
   saturations can be predicted from the capillary pressures and the water
   and total-liquid saturation-path histories. Relations between relative
   permeabilities and saturations are modified to account for the residual
   NAPL by adjusting the limits of integration in the integral expression
   used for predicting the NAPL relative permeability. When all of the NAPL
   is either residual or entrapped (i.e., no free NAPL), then the NAPL
   relative permeability will be zero. We model residual NAPL using
   concepts similar to those used to model residual water. As an initial
   test of the constitutive model, we compare predictions to published
   measurements of residual NAPL. Furthermore, we present results using the
   modified constitutive theory for a scenario involving NAPL imbibition
   and drainage. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The mass transfer rate from residual dense non-aqueous phase liquids
   (DNAPLs) to the mobile aqueous phase is an important parameter for the
   efficiency of surfactant-enhanced remediation through solubilization of
   this type of contamination. The mass transfer kinetics are highly
   dependent on the dimensionality of the system. In this study,
   irregularly shaped residual TCE saturations in two-dimensional saturated
   flow fields were flushed with a 2\% polyoxyethylene sorbitan (20)
   monooleate (POESMO) solution until complete removal had been achieved. A
   numerical model was developed and used for the simulation of the various
   surfactant-flushing experiments with different initial saturation
   patterns and flow rates. Through optimization against in situ
   concentration and saturation data, a phenomenological power-law model
   for the relationship between the mass transfer rate from the DNAPL to
   the mobile aqueous phase on the one hand and the residual DNAPL
   saturation and the flow velocity on the other hand was derived. The
   obtained mass transfer rate parameters provide a reasonable fit to the
   experimental data, predicting the cleanup time and the general
   saturation and concentration pattern quite well but failing to predict
   the concentration curves at every individual sampling port. The obtained
   mass transfer rate model gives smaller values for the predicted mass
   transfer rate but shows a comparable dependence on water flow and
   saturation as in earlier published one-dimensional column experiments
   with identical characteristics for porous medium, DNAPL and surfactant.
   Mass transfer rate predictions were about one order of magnitude lower
   in the 2-D flow cell experiment than in 1-D column experiments. These
   results give an indication for the importance of dimensionality during
   surfactant remediation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Radon gas concentrations have been monitored as part of the operation of
   a tunnel (the Exploratory Studies Facility-ESF) at Yucca Mountain to
   ensure worker safety. The objective of this study was to examine the
   potential use of the radon data to estimate large-scale formation
   properties of fractured tuffs. This objective was examined by developing
   a numerical model, based upon the characteristics of the ESF and the
   Topopah Spring welded (TSw) tuff unit, capable of predicting radon
   concentrations for prescribed ventilation conditions. The model was used
   to address two specific issues. First, it was used to estimate the
   permeability and porosity of the fractures in the TSw at the length
   scale of the ESF and extending tens of meters into the TSw, which
   surrounds the ESE Second, the model was used to understand the mechanism
   leading to radon concentrations exceeding a specified level within the
   ESF. The mechanism controlling radon concentrations in the ESF is a
   function of atmospheric barometric fluctuations being propagated down
   the ESF along with ventilated air flow and the slight suction induced by
   the ventilation exhaust fans at the South Portal of the ESE These
   pressure fluctuations are dampened in the TSw fracture continuum
   according to its permeability and porosity. Consequently, as the
   barometric pressure in the ESF drops rapidly, formation gases from the
   TSw are pulled into the ESF, resulting in an increase in radon
   concentrations. Model calibration to both radon concentrations measured
   in the ESF and gas-phase pressure fluctuations in the TSw yielded
   concurrent estimates of TSw fracture permeability and porosity of 1 x
   10(-11) m(2) and 0.00034, respectively. The calibrated model was then
   used as a design tool to predict the effect of adjusting the current
   ventilation-system operation strategy for reducing the probability of

Abstract = {{The fate of fuel oxygenates such as methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in
   the subsurface is governed by their degradability under various redox
   conditions. The key intermediate in degradation of MTBE and ethyl
   tert-butyl ether (ETBE) is tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) which was often
   found as accumulating intermediate or dead-end product in lab studies
   using microcosms or isolated cell suspensions. This review discusses in
   detail the thermodynamics of the degradation processes utilizing various
   terminal electron acceptors, and the aerobic degradation pathways of
   MTBE and TBA. It summarizes the present knowledge on MTBE and TBA
   degradation gained from either microcosm or pure culture studies and
   emphasizes the potential of compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA)
   for identification and quantification of degradation processes of slowly
   biodegradable pollutants such as MTBE and TBA.
   Microcosm studies demonstrated that MTBE and TBA may be biodegradable
   under oxic and nearly all anoxic conditions, although results of various
   studies are often contradictory, which suggests that site-specific
   conditions are important parameters. So far, TBA degradation has not
   been shown under methanogenic conditions and it is currently widely
   accepted that TBA is a recalcitrant dead-end product of MTBE under these
   conditions. Reliable in situ degradation rates for MTBE and TBA under
   various geochemical conditions are not yet available. Furthermore,
   degradation pathways under anoxic conditions have not yet been
   elucidated. All pure cultures capable of MTBE or TBA degradation
   isolated so far use oxygen as terminal electron acceptor.
   In general, compared with hydrocarbons present in gasoline, fuel
   oxygenates biodegrade much slower, if at all. The presence of MTBE and
   related compounds in groundwater therefore frequently limits the use of
   in situ biodegradation as remediation option at gasoline-contaminated
   sites. Though degradation of MTBE and TBA in field studies has been
   reported under oxic conditions, there is hardly any evidence of
   substantial degradation in the absence of oxygen. The increasing
   availability of field data from CSIA will foster our understanding and
   may even allow the quantification of degradation of these recalcitrant
   compounds. Such information will help to elucidate the crucial factors
   of site-specific biogeochemical conditions that govern the capability of
   intrinsic oxygenate degradation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nowadays, it is necessary to understand and identify the reactions
   governing the fate of heavy metals introduced into the environment with
   low complexing organic compounds, particularly when they are transferred
   through soils in urban areas. In this work the concomitant influence of
   pH and acetate on the fate of zinc on siliceous sand was studied in
   batch and non-saturated column experiments. Total zinc concentrations
   varied between 2 and 20 mg/l, and total acetate concentrations were
   fixed at 22, 72, 132, and 223 mM to obtain solution pHs of 4, 5, 6 and
   7, respectively. Natural sand (diameter, 0.3-2 mm), mainly constituted
   of silica, was used. In batch adsorption experiments, zinc adsorption is
   insignificant at pH 4, low and linear at pH 5, and increasingly
   nonlinear, of the Langmuir type, at pH 6 and 7 indicating
   near-saturation conditions of surface sites at these high pH values. In
   column experiments, Zn retardation increases and the maximum outlet
   concentration of Zn decreases with rising pH and acetate concentrations.
   Previous column tracer experiments revealed the occurrence of
   regionalized water transport in the column. Modeling these data was
   based on a non-electrostatic approach. Batch and column data modeling
   was based on the PHREEQC code that allows concomitant resolution of
   chemical speciation and regionalized water transport. The speciation
   calculation indicates that the ZnAcetate(+) species is the dominant Zn
   species in the solutions used. Batch experimental curves are correctly
   modeled assuming the formation of the three surface species equivalent
   toSiOZn(+), equivalent toSiOH-Zn Acetate(+) and equivalent
   toSiO-Zn(Acetate)(2)(-). The column data could be adequately modeled
   assuming a two-region water transport and the formation of the same
   three species with the same thermodynamic constants determined in the
   batch experiments. The hypothesis of the modeling leads to a slight
   overestimation of the quantities of zinc eluted (10\%) at pH 6 and 7,
   mostly in the desorption phase. These results show that the methodology
   used facilitates the correct modeling of both batch and transport
   experiments and formulation of the hypothesis on the interactions
   between the low reactive sand and a complex solution. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Saturated-unsaturated flow in strictly layered sediments proceeds via
   conductors in parallel in the direction parallel to bedding, and via
   resistors in series in the direction perpendicular to bedding. On
   sufficiently small scales of space and time, flow in such media will be
   subject to approximate capillary equilibrium locally, which provides a
   basis for approximating the effective hydraulic conductivity of a
   composite multi-layer medium in terms of the conductivities of the
   individual layers. Equations for the hydraulic conductivity tensor in
   ``composite medium approximation{''} (COMA) are given in a coordinate
   system aligned with bedding. Hydraulic conductivity parallel to bedding
   is generally larger than in the perpendicular direction. The anisotropy
   depends on the spread of the conductivity distribution, and tends to
   increase for dryer conditions. The COMA model was implemented in a
   multi-phase flow simulator and tested by comparison with high-resolution
   simulations in which all layering heterogeneity is resolved explicitly.
   Under favorable conditions, COMA is found to accurately represent
   sub-grid scale flow and transport processes, providing a practical
   method for simulating field-scale flow and transport in layered media.
   The approximation improves when layers are thinner, and when flow rates
   are smaller. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeochemical processes goveming leachate attenuation inside a
   landfill leachate plume (Banisveld, the Netherlands) were revealed and
   quantified using the ID reactive transport model PHREEQC-2.
   Biodegradation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was simulated assuming
   first-order oxidation of two DOC fractions with different reactivity,
   and was coupled to reductive dissolution of iron oxide. The following
   secondary geochemical processes were required in the model to match
   observations: kinetic precipitation of calcite and siderite, cation
   exchange, proton buffering and degassing. Rate constants for DOC
   oxidation and carbonate mineral precipitation were determined, and other
   model parameters were optimized using the nonlinear optimization program
   PEST by means of matching hydrochemical observations closely (pH, DIC,
   DOC, Na, K, Ca, Mg, NH4, Fe(II), SO4, Cl, CH4, saturation index of
   calcite and siderite). The modelling demonstrated the relevance and
   impact of various secondary geochemical processes on leachate plume
   evolution. Concomitant precipitation of siderite masked the act of iron
   reduction. Cation exchange resulted in release of Fe(II) from the
   pristine anaerobic aquifer to the leachate. Degassing, triggered by
   elevated CO2 pressures caused by carbonate precipitation and proton
   buffering at the front of the plume, explained the observed downstream
   decrease in methane concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory in order to
   improve the understanding of radionuclide retention properties of
   fractured crystalline bedrock in the 10-100 m scale (TRUE Block Scale
   Project, jointly funded by ANDRA, ENRESA, Nirex, JNC, Posiva and SKB). A
   series of tracer experiments were performed using sorbing tracers in
   three different flow paths. The different flow paths had Euclidian
   lengths of 14, 17 and 33 m, respectively, and one to three water
   conducting structures. Four tests were performed using different
   cocktails made up of radioactive sorbing tracers (Na-22,24(+), K-42(+),
   Ca-47(2+), Sr-85(2+), Rb-83.86(+), Ba-131,133(2+) and Cs-134,137(+)).
   For each tracer injection, the breakthrough of sorbing tracers was
   compared to the breakthrough of a conservative tracer, Br-82(-),
   I-131(-), HTO and (ReO4-)-Re-186, respectively. In the two longer flow
   paths, no breakthrough of Rb-113(+) and Cs-137(+) was observed after 8
   months of pumping. Selected tracer tests were subject to basic modelling
   in which a one-dimensional (ID) advection-dispersion model, including
   surface sorption, and an unlimited matrix diffusion were used for the
   interpretation of the results. The results of the modelling indicated
   that there is a slightly higher mass transfer into a highly porous
   material in the block-scale experiment compared with in situ experiments
   performed over shorter distances and significantly higher than what
   would have been expected from laboratory data obtained from studies of
   the interactions in nonaltered intact rock. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) was reduced to immobile and nontoxic
   Cr(III) by a dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria, Shewanella alga
   Simidu (BrY-MT) ATCC 55627. A series of kinetic batch and dynamic column
   experiments were conducted to provide an understanding of Cr(VI)
   reduction by the facultative anaerobe BrY-MT. Reduction of Cr(VI) was
   rapid (within 1 h) in columns packed with quartz sand and bacteria,
   whereas Cr(VI) reduction by BrY-MT was delayed (57 h) in the presence of
   beta-MnO2-coated sand. A mathematical model was developed and evaluated
   against data obtained from column experiments. The model takes into
   account (I) advective-dispersive transport of Cr(III), Cr(VI), lactate,
   and protein (mobile and immobile bacteria); (2) first-order kinetic
   adsorption of Cr(III) and lactate; (3) conversion of solid phase
   beta-MnO2 to solid phase MnOOH due to oxidation of Cr(III); (4)
   dual-Monod kinetics, where Cr(VI) is the electron acceptor and lactate
   is the electron donor. The breakthrough data for Cr(III), Cr(VI),
   lactate, and protein (mobile and immobile bacteria) were fitted
   simultaneously. The breakthrough data are well described by the
   mathematical model that considers the above processes. This result
   demonstrates the ability of the coupled hydrobiogeochemical model to
   simulate chromium transport in complex reactive systems. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{A model was developed simulating reactive transport in groundwater
   including bioclogging. Results from a bioclogging experiment in a flow
   cell with a two-dimensional flow field were used as a data base to
   verify the simulation results of the model. Simulations were performed
   using three different hydraulic conductivity vs. porosity relations
   published in literature; two relations derived from pore network
   simulations assuming the biomass to grow in discrete colonies and as a
   biofilm, respectively, and a third relation, which did not include pore
   connectivity in more than one dimension. Best agreement with the
   experimental data was achieved using a hydraulic conductivity vs.
   porosity relation derived from pore network simulation assuming the
   biomass to grow in colonies. The relation derived from pore network
   simulations assuming biomass to grow as a biofilm was unable to
   reproduce the experimental data when realistic parameter values were
   employed. With the third relation the clogging ability of the biomass
   was strongly underestimated. These findings indicate that the porous
   medium needs to be treated as a multi-dimensional medium already on the
   pore scale, and that biomass growth different than in a biofilm must be
   considered to get an appropriate description of bioclogging. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A dual-permeability model (S-ID-DUAL) was developed to simulate the
   transport of land-applied pesticides in macroporous media. In this
   model, one flow domain was represented by the bulk matrix and the other
   by the preferential flow domain (PFD) where water and chemicals move at
   faster rates. The model assumed the validity of Darcian flow and the
   advective-dispersive solute transport in each of the two domains with
   inter-domain transfer of water and solutes due to pressure and
   concentration gradients. It was conceptualized that sorption and
   biodegradation rates vary with soil depth as well as in each of the two
   flow domains. In addition to equilibrium sorption, kinetic sorption was
   simulated in the PFD. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the
   combined effects of preferential flow, depth- and domain-variant
   sorption, and degradation on leaching of two pesticides: one with strong
   sorption potential (trifluralin) and the other with weak sorption
   potential (atrazine). Simulation results for a test case showed that
   water flux in the PFD was three times more than in the matrix for
   selected storm events. When equilibrium sorption was considered, the
   simulated profile of trifluralin in each domain was similar; however,
   the atrazine profile was deeper in the PFD than in the bulk matrix under
   episodic storm events. With an assumption of negligible sorption in the
   PFD, both the atrazine and the trifluralin profiles moved twice deeper
   into the PFD. The simulated concentrations of the chemicals were several
   orders higher in the PFD than in the matrix, even at deeper depths. The
   volume fraction of the macropores and the sorption and biodegradation
   properties of the chemicals could also affect the amount of pesticides
   leaving the root zone. For an intense storm event, slow sorption
   reaction rates in the PFD produced higher breakthrough concentrations of
   atrazine at the bottom of the simulated soil profile, thus posing the
   risk for breakthrough of chemicals from the root zone. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transport of reactive solute in unsaturated soils under an
   infiltration-redistribution cycle is investigated. The study is based on
   the model of vertical flow and transport in the unsaturated zone
   proposed by Indelman et al. {[}J. Contam. Hydrol. 32 (1998) 77], and
   generalizes it by accounting for linear nonequilibrium kinetics. An
   exact analytical Solution is derived for an irreversible desorption
   reaction. The transport of solute obeying linear kinetics is modeled by
   assuming equilibrium during the redistribution stage. The model which
   accounts for nonequilibrium during the infiltration and assumes
   equilibrium at the redistribution stage is termed partial equilibrium
   infiltration-redistribution model (PEIRM). It allows to derive
   approximate closed form solutions for transport in one-dimensional
   homogeneous soils. These solutions are further applied to computing the
   field-scale concentration by adopting the Dagan and Bresler {[}Soil Sci.
   Soc. Am. J. 43 (1979) 461] column model. The effect of soil
   heterogeneity on the solute spread is investigated by modeling the
   hydraulic saturated conductivity as a random function of horizontal
   coordinates. The quality of the PEIRM is illustrated by calculating the
   critical values of the Damkohler number which provide the achievable
   accuracy in estimating the solute mass in the mobile phase.
   The distinguishing feature of transport during the
   infiltration-redistribution cycle as compared to that of infiltration
   only is the finite depth of solute penetration. For irreversible
   desorption, the maximum solute penetration W/theta(r) is determined by
   the amount of applied water W and the residual water content theta(r).
   For sorption-desorption kinetics, the maximum depth of penetration
   Z(r)(e,)(infinity) also depends on the ratio between the rate of
   application and the column-saturated conductivity. It is shown that
   Z(r)(e,)(infinity) is bounded between the depths W/(theta(r)+ K-d) and
   W/theta(r) corresponding to the maximum Solute penetration for
   equilibrium transport and for irreversible desorption, respectively.
   This feature Of Solute penetration explains the unusual phenomena of
   plume contraction after an initial period of spreading {[}Lessoff, S.C.,

   P.A.C., Smiles, D.,Warrick, A.W (Eds), Environmental Mechanics: Water,
   Mass and Energy Transport in the Biosphere. American Geophysical Union,
   pp. 133-144]. Unlike transport under equilibrium conditions, when the
   solute is completely concentrated at the front, the solute under
   nonequilibrium conditions is spread out behind the front. Heterogeneity
   leads to additional spreading of the plume. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The biodegradation pathways of 1,1,2,2-tetracliloroethane (TeCA) and
   1,1,2-trichloroethane (112TCA) and the associated microbial communities
   in anaerobic wetland sediments were evaluated Using Concurrent
   geochemical and genetic analyses over time in laboratory rnicrocosm
   experiments. Experimental results were compared to in situ porewater
   data in the wetland to better understand the factors controlling
   daughter product distributions in a chlorinated solvent plume
   discharging to a freshwater tidal wetland at Aberdeen Proving Ground,
   Maryland. Microcosms constructed with wetland sediment from two sites
   showed little difference in the initial degradation steps of TeCA, which
   included simultaneous hydrogenolysis to 112TCA and dichloroelimination
   to 1,2-dichloroethene (12DCE). The rnicrocosms from the two sites showed
   a substantial difference, however, in the relative dominance of
   subsequent dichloroelimination of 112TCA. A greater dominance of 112TCA
   dichloroelimination in microcosms constructed with sediment that was
   initially iron-reducing and subsequently simultaneously iron-reducing
   and methanogenic caused approximately twice as much vinyl chloride (VC)
   production as microcosms constructed with sediment that was methanogenic
   only throughout the incubation. The microcosms with higher VC production
   also showed substantially more rapid VC degradation. Field measurements
   of redox-sensitive constituents, TeCA, and its anaerobic degradation
   products along flowpaths in the wetland porewater also showed greater
   production and degradation of VC with concurrent methanogenesis and iron
   reduction.
   Molecular fingerprinting indicated that bacterial species {[}represented
   by a peak at a fragment size of 198 base pairs (bp) by Mn/1 digest] are
   associated with VC production from 112TCA dichloroelimination, whereas
   methanogens (190 and 307 bp) from the Methanococcales or
   Methanobacteriales family are associated with VC production from 12DCE
   hydrogenolysis. Acetate-utilizing methanogens (acetotrophs) appear to be
   involved in the biodegradation of VC. The relative abundance of
   Methanosarcinaceae, the only methanogen group with acetotrophic members,
   doubled in microcosms in which degradation of VC was observed. In
   addition, molecular analyses using primers specific for known
   dehalorespiring bacteria in the Dehalococcoides and Desulfuromonas

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation tools have been used to study the dominating
   processes during transport of aromatic hydrocarbons in the unsaturated
   soil zone. Simulations were based on field observations at an
   experimental site located on a glacial delta plain with pronounced
   layered sedimentary structures. A numerical model for transport in the
   unsaturated zone, SWMS-3D, has been extended to incorporate coupled
   multispecies transport, microbial degradation following Monod kinetics
   and gas diffusive transport of oxygen and hydrocarbons. The flow field
   parameters were derived from previous work using nonreactive tracers.
   Breakthrough curves (BTC) from the hydrocarbon field experiment were
   used to determine sorption parameters and Monod kinetic parameters using
   a fitting procedure. The numerical simulations revealed that the
   assumption of homogeneous layers resulted in deviations from the field
   observations. The deviations were more pronounced with incorporation of
   reactive transport, compared with earlier work on nonreactive transport.
   To be able to model reasonable BTC, sorption had to be reduced compared
   to laboratory experiments. The initial biomass and the maximum
   utilisation rate could be adjusted to capture both the initial lag phase
   and the overall degradation rate. Nevertheless, local oxygen limitation
   is predicted by the model, which was not observed in the field
   experiment. Incorporation of evaporation and diffusive gas transport of
   the hydrocarbons did not significantly change the local oxygen demand.
   The main cause of the observed discrepancies between model and field are
   attributed to channelling as a result of small-scale heterogeneities
   such as biopores. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of physicochemical characteristics and motility on
   bacterial transport in groundwater were examined in flow-through
   columns. Four strains of bacteria isolated from a crystalline rock
   groundwater system were investigated, with carboxylate-modified and
   amidine-modified latex microspheres and bromide as reference tracers.
   The bacterial isolates included a gram-positive rod (ML1), a
   gram-negative motile rod (ML2), a nonmotile mutant of ML2 (ML2m), and a
   gram-positive coccoid (ML3). Experiments were repeated at two flow
   velocities, in a glass column packed with glass beads, and in another
   packed with iron-oxyhydroxide coated glass beads. Bacteria breakthrough
   curves were interpreted using a transport equation that incorporates a
   sorption model from microscopic observation of bacterial deposition in
   flow-cell experiments. The model predicts that bacterial desorption rate
   will decrease exponentially with the amount of time the cell is attached
   to the solid surface. Desorption kinetics appeared to influence
   transport at the lower flow rate, but were not discernable at the higher
   flow rate. Iron-oxyhydroxide coatings had a lower-than-expected effect
   on bacterial breakthrough and no effect on the microsphere recovery in
   the column experiments. Cell wall type and shape also had minor effects
   on breakthrough. Motility tended to increase the adsorption rate, and
   decrease the desorption rate. The transport model predicts that at field
   scale, desorption rate kinetics may be important to the prediction of
   bacteria transport rates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Discrete-depth sampling of inorganic groundwater chemistry is essential
   for a variety of site characterization activities. Although the mobility
   and rapid sampling capabilities of direct-push techniques have led to
   their widespread use for evaluating the distribution of organic
   contaminants, complementary methods for the characterization of spatial
   variations in geochemical conditions have not been developed. In this
   study, a direct-push-based approach for high-resolution inorganic
   chemical profiling was developed at a site where sharp chemical
   contrasts and iron-reducing conditions had previously been observed.
   Existing multilevel samplers (MLSs) that span a fining-upward alluvial
   sequence were used for comparison with the direct-push profiling.
   Chemical profiles obtained with a conventional direct-push
   exposed-screen sampler differed from those obtained with an adjacent MLS
   because of sampler reactivity and mixing with water from previous
   sampling levels. The sampler was modified by replacing steel sampling
   components with stainless-steel and heat-treated parts, and adding an
   adapter that prevents mixing. Profiles obtained with the modified
   approach were in excellent agreement with those obtained from an
   adjacent MLS for all constituents and parameters monitored (Cl, NO3, Fe,
   Mn, DO, ORP, specific conductance and pH). Interpretations of site redox
   conditions based on field-measured parameters were supported by
   laboratory analysis of dissolved Fe. The discrete-depth capability of
   this approach allows inorganic chemical variations to be described at a
   level of detail that has rarely been possible. When combined with the
   mobility afforded by direct-push rigs and on-site methods of chemical
   analysis, the new approach is well suited for a variety of interactive
   site-characterization endeavors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A mixture of chlorinated solvents (about 0.5 - 10 mg/l), including
   tetrachloroethene (PCE) and carbon tetrachloride (CT), together with a
   petroleum hydrocarbon, toluene (TOL), were introduced into a 24 m long x
   2 m wide x 3 m deep isolated section (henceforth called a gate) of the
   Borden aquifer and subjected to sequential in situ treatment. An
   identical section of aquifer was similarly contaminated and allowed to
   self-remediate by natural attenuation, thus serving as a control. The
   control presents a rare opportunity to critically assess the performance
   of the treatment systems, and represents the first such study for
   sequenced in situ remediation. The first treatment step was anaerobic
   bioremediation. This was accomplished using a modified nutrient
   injection wall (NIW) to pulse benzoate and a nutrient solution into the
   aquifer, maximizing mixing by dispersion and minimizing fouling near the
   injection wells. In the anaerobic bioactive zone that developed, PCE, CT
   and chloroform (CF), a degradation product of CT, degraded with a
   half-lives of about 59, 5.9 and 1.7 days, respectively. The second step
   was aerobic bioremediation, using a biosparge system. TOL and cis-1,2
   dichloroethene (cDCE), from PCE degradation, were found to degrade
   aerobically with half-lives of 17 and 15 days, respectively. Compared to
   natural attenuation, PCE and TOL removal rates were significantly better
   in the sequenced treatment gate. However, CT and CF were similarly and
   completely attenuated in both gates. It is believed that the presence of
   TOL helped sustain the reducing environment needed for the reduction of
   these two compounds. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Denitrification walls are a practical approach for decreasing non-point
   source pollution of surface waters. They are constructed by digging a
   trench perpendicular to groundwater flow and mixing the aquifer material
   with organic matter, such as sawdust, which acts as a carbon source to
   stimulate denitrification. For efficient functioning, walls need to be
   permeable to groundwater flow. We examined the functioning of a
   denitrification wall constructed in an aquifer consisting of coarse
   sands. Wells were monitored for changes in nitrate concentration as
   groundwater passed through the wall and soil samples were taken to
   measure microbial parameters inside the wall. Nitrate concentrations
   upstream of the wall ranged from 21 to 39 g N m(-3), in the wall from 0
   to 2 g N m(-3) and downstream from 19 to 44 g N m(-3). An initial
   groundwater flow investigation using a salt tracer dilution technique
   showed that the flow through the wall was less than 4\% of the flow
   occurring in the aquifer. Natural gradient tracer tests using bromide
   and Rhodamine-WT confirmed groundwater bypass under the wall. Hydraulic
   conductivity of 0.48 m day(-1) was measured inside the wall, whereas the
   surrounding aquifer had a hydraulic conductivity of 65.4 m day(-1). This
   indicated that during construction of the wall, hydraulic conductivity
   of the aquifer had been greatly reduced, so that most of the groundwater
   flowed under rather than through the wall. Denitrification rates
   measured in the center of the wall ranged from 0.020 to 0.13 g N m(-3)
   day(-1), which did not account for the rates of nitrate removal
   (0.16-0.29 g N m(-3) day(-1)) calculated from monitoring of groundwater
   nitrate concentrations. This suggested that the rate of denitrification
   was greater at the upstream face of the wall than in its center where it
   was limited by low nitrate concentrations. While denitrification walls
   can be an inexpensive tool for removing nitrate from groundwater, they
   may not be suitable in aquifers with coarse textured subsoils where
   simple inexpensive construction techniques result in major decreases in
   hydraulic conductivity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source zone was established
   within a sheet-pile isolated cell through a controlled release of
   perchloroethylene (PCE) to evaluate DNAPL remediation by in-situ
   cosolvent flushing. Ethanol was used as the cosolvent, and the main
   remedial mechanism was enhanced dissolution based on the phase behavior
   of the water-ethanol-PCE system. Based on the knowledge of the actual
   PCE volume introduced into the cell, it was estimated that 83 L of PCE
   were present at the start of the test. Over a 40-day period, 64\% of the
   PCE was removed by flushing the cell with an alcohol solution of
   approximately 70\% ethanol and 30\% water. High removal efficiencies at
   the end of the test indicated that more PCE could have been removed had
   it been possible to continue the demonstration. The ethanol solution
   extracted from the cell was recycled during the test using activated
   carbon and air stripping treatment. Both of these treatment processes
   were successful in removing PCE for recycling purposes, with minimal
   impact on the ethanol content in the treated fluids. Results from pre-
   and post-flushing partitioning tracer tests overestimated the treatment
   performance. However, both of these tracer tests missed significant
   amounts of the PCE present, likely due to inaccessibility of the PCE.
   The tracer results suggest that some PCE was inaccessible to the ethanol
   solution which led to the inefficient PCE removal rates observed. The
   flux-averaged aqueous PCE concentrations measured in the post-flushing
   tracer test were reduced by a factor of 3 to 4 in the extraction wells
   that showed the highest PCE removal compared to those concentrations in
   the pre-flushing tracer test. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous diffusion in different regions of a fractured granodiorite
   from Japan has been observed and measured through the use of X-ray
   absorption imaging. These regions include gouge-filled fractures,
   recrystallized fracture-filling material and hydrothermally altered
   matrix. With the X-ray absorption imaging technique, porosity, relative
   concentration, and relative mass of an iodine tracer were imaged in two
   dimensions with a sub-millimeter pixel size. Because portions of the
   samples analyzed have relatively low porosity values, imaging errors can
   potentially impact the results. For this reason, efforts were made to
   better understand and quantify this error. Based on the X-ray data, pore
   diffusion coefficients (D-p) for the different regions were estimated
   assuming a single diffusion rate and a lognormal multirate distribution
   of D-p. Results show D-p for the gouge-filled fractures are over an
   order of magnitude greater than those of the recrystallized
   fracture-filling material, which in turn is approximately two times
   greater than those for the altered matrix. The recrystallized
   fracture-filling material was found to exhibit the greatest degree of
   variability. The results of these experiments also provide evidence that
   diffusion from advective zones in fractures through the gouge-filled
   fractures and recrystallized fracture-filling material could increase
   the pore space available for matrix diffusion. This evidence is
   important for understanding the performance of potential nuclear waste
   repositories in crystalline rocks as diffusion is thought to be an
   important retardation mechanism for radionuclides. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V

Abstract = {{In this work, we investigate one-dimensional solute transport affected
   by rate-limited sorption, first-order mass transfer, and first-order
   transformation. Analytical expressions are obtained for the temporal
   moments of the solute in the solution phase. The effect of various rate
   coefficients on the temporal moments is examined. It was found that, in
   the presence of transformation reactions, the mean arrival time, and the
   spread and skewness of the breakthrough curves, are not monotonic
   functions of the rate coefficients. These solutions will be useful as a
   preliminary analysis tool for ascertaining the relative importance of
   various processes under given conditions. They may also be used to
   analyze the accuracy of various numerical techniques used for simulation
   of reactive transport. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality in the unsaturated and saturated zones of a waste rock
   pile containing sulphides was investigated. The main objectives of the
   project were (1) the evaluation of geochemical trends including the acid
   mine drainage (AMD)-buffering mechanism and the role of secondary
   minerals, and (2) the investigation of the use of stable isotopes for
   the interpretation of physical and geochemical processes in waste rock.
   Pore water in unsaturated zone was sampled from suction lysimeters and
   with piezometers in underlying saturated rocks. The investigation
   revealed strong temporal (dry period vs. recharge period), and spatial
   (slope vs. central region of pile) variability in the formation of acid
   mine drainage. The main secondary minerals observed were gypsum and
   jarosite. There was a higher concentration of gypsum in solid phase at
   Site TBT than at Site 6, suggesting that part of the gypsum formed at
   Site 6 in the early stage of AMD has been already dissolved. Formation
   of secondary minerals contributed to the formation of AMD by opening of
   foliation planes in waste rock, thus increasing the access of oxidants
   like O-2 and Fe3+ to previously encapsulated pyrite. The behavior of
   several dissolved species such as Mg, Al, and Fe2+ can be considered as
   conservative in the leachate. Stable isotopes, deuterium and O-18,
   indicated internal evaporation within the pile, and were used to trace
   recharge pulses from snowmelt. Isotope trends for S-34 and O-18(SO4)
   indicated a lack of sulfate reduction and zones of active oxidation of
   pyrite, respectively. Results of numerical modeling of pyrite oxidation
   and gas and water transport were consistent with geochemical and
   isotopic trends and confirmed zones of high evaporation rate within the
   rock pile close to the slope. The results indicate that physical and
   chemical processes within the pile are strongly coupled and cannot be
   considered separately when oxidation rates are high and influence gas
   transport as a result of heat generation. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Alcohol addition has been suggested for use in combination with
   surfactant flushing to enhance solubilization kinetics and permit
   density control of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)-laden
   surfactant plumes. This study examined the effects of adding ethanol
   (EtOH) to a 4\% Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate)
   solution used to flush tetrachloroethene (PCE)-contaminated porous
   media. The influence of EtOH concentration, subsurface layering and
   scale on flushing solution delivery and PCE recovery was investigated
   through a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling studies.
   Results of batch experiments demonstrated that the addition of 2.5\%,
   5\% and 10\% (wt.) EtOH incrementally increased the PCE solubilization
   capacity and viscosity of the surfactant solution, while reducing
   solution density from 1.002 to 0.986 g/cm(3). Effluent concentration
   data obtained from one-dimensional (1-D) column experiments were used to
   characterize rate-limited micellar solubilization of residual PCE, which
   was strongly dependent upon flow velocity and weakly dependent upon EtOH
   concentration. Two-dimensional (2-D) box studies illustrated that minor
   differences (0.008 g/cm(3)) between flushing and resident solution
   density can strongly influence surfactant front propagation. A
   two-dimensional multiphase simulator, MISER, was used to model the
   influence of EtOH composition on the aqueous flow field and PCE mass
   recovery. The ability of the numerical simulator to predict effluent
   concentrations and front propagation was demonstrated for both 1-D
   columns and 2-D boxes flushed with EtOH-amended Tween 80 solutions.
   Results of this study quantify the potential influence of alcohol
   addition on surfactant solution properties and solubilization capacity,
   and demonstrate the importance of considering small density variations
   in remedial design. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fact that flooded underground mines are commonly hydrochemically
   stratified is often not appreciated. Water samples taken from the water
   surface in partly flooded shafts are often wrongly assumed to represent
   the water quality existing throughout the entire water column. In some
   cases, treatment systems have been designed on the basis of these often
   misleading water surface samples. Stratification can build up within a
   slowly recovering system where there are few lateral inflows and
   outflows to the system. Less mineralised, shallow-sourced water enters
   at the top of the water column and more heavily mineralised water tends
   to remain at the base of the water column. This water has a high
   dissolved solids content due to dissolution of increasing amounts of
   pyrite oxidation salts and other minerals as the water level rises
   through the old workings. However, such stratification can easily be
   lost following hydraulic disturbance of the system (either by pumping or
   by natural decant when the water level reaches an outflow pathway from
   the mine system, such as an old adit or shaft collar) and often results
   in surface discharges of poor water quality. Test pumping of one such
   stratified system (Frances Colliery, Scotland) has provided useful
   information about how stratified systems develop, and how they can
   behave when disturbed. The water quality observed after stratification
   was disturbed by pumping was worse than would have been anticipated on
   the basis of water samples taken from the surface of the water column
   prior to pumping (with concentrations of contaminants such as iron and
   zinc being around two orders of magnitude greater than in water surface
   samples). Taken together with other information from the literature, the
   experience at Frances Colliery supports the proposal of criteria for
   recognising when stratification of mine water quality might be
   anticipated, thus facilitating the timely deployment of measures
   required for its detection at an early stage. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The stability of uranium-bearing minerals in natural environments is of
   interest to evaluate the feasibility of radioactive waste repositories.
   The uraninite bodies, UO2(s), in the Oklo district (Gabon) are the
   result of a natural fission process, which took place 1970 Ma ago. These
   deposits can be regarded as natural analogues for spent fuel. One of the
   uraninite bodies, the Okelobondo deposit, is located at a depth of 300
   in. Groundwater samples from boreholes located at shallow depths
   (100-200 in) show neutral to basic pH, anoxic conditions (Eh = 0.10 to
   -0.05 V) and are saturated with respect to uraninite. In contrast,
   deeper samples collected in the vicinity of the ore body are oxidising
   (Eh = 0.32-0.47 V), slightly basic (pH = 7.0-8.5) and undersaturated
   with respect to uraninite. These oxidising conditions at depth, if
   present under repository conditions, may affect the stability of uranium
   oxide.
   In order to improve our understanding of the observed site geochemistry,
   the available information on the lithology and groundwater flow was
   integrated in a reactive transport model. The chemical composition and
   the pH-Eh values of the water sampled above and in the western side of
   the Okelobondo deposit can be explained by the interaction of meteoric
   recharge with pelites, dolomites and sandstones. The dissolution of
   Fe(II)-silicates and the oxidation of the Fe(II)-aqueous species
   maintained the pH-Eh distribution along the Fe2+-Fe(OH)(3)(am)
   equilibrium, with the result that uraninite does not dissolve. This may
   explain the lower uranium content in the water samples from pelites and
   dolomites above the Okelobondo deposit. The high Mn/Fe ratio and the
   high pH-Eh values of the water sampled at depth, close to the Okelobondo
   deposit, suggest a control by the Mn2+-MnOOH(s) equilibrium. This
   control is attributed to the dissolution of a large rhodochrosite,
   MnCO3(s), and manganite, MnOOH(s) deposit in the recharge area on the
   eastern side. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A streamline-based history matching technique is employed to perform
   fast and efficient permeability identification and to integrate tracer
   data into an inverse model. To incorporate tracer data into the inverse
   model, a given tracer breakthrough curve is interpreted as cumulative
   breakthrough along independent streamlines. Permeabilities are modified
   along each streamline to match the tracer breakthrough curve. In this
   way, there is no explicit computation of sensitivity coefficients, nor
   any matrix inversion. However, this approach is incomplete by itself
   Since the modifications occur along the streamlines, the identified
   permeability distribution is often incompatible with the actual
   permeability distribution. Thus, streamlines should be positioned
   correctly before the streamline-based method is applied. To accomplish
   this, geostatistical methods such as kriging and sequential Gaussian
   simulation (SGS) are implemented to provide an appropriate disposition
   of streamlines at the beginning of the inverse process. Then,
   permeabilities are iteratively calibrated in a conventional grid system
   to satisfy pressure and permeability observation data, and
   simultaneously modified along streamlines to match tracer data. The two
   independent optimization processes assist mutually and lead to stable
   convergence to a minimum.
   By applying the proposed inverse system to synthetic reference fields,
   it is observed that identified fields satisfactorily reproduce the
   permeability distribution of the reference fields. In addition, the
   pressure distributions of the identified and the reference fields are
   fairly alike, And the identified tracer breakthrough curves are well
   fitted to those of the reference fields. With regard to spatial patterns
   of transport behaviors, the streamlines of the identified fields show
   similar trajectories to those of the reference fields, and the time of
   flight distributions of the inversed fields are also analogous to those
   of the reference fields. The proposed inverse system is capable of
   estimating the future performance of a two-dimensional aquifer from a
   constrained number of permeability and pressure observation data
   accompanied by tracer data. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) are expected to spread at the
   air-water interface, particularly under non-equilibrium conditions. In
   the vadose zone, this spreading should increase the surface area for
   mass transfer and the efficiency of volatile NAPL recovery by soil vapor
   extraction (SVE). Observations of spreading on water wet surfaces led to
   a conceptual model of oil spreading vertically above a NAPL pool in the
   vadose zone. Analysis of this model predicts that spreading can enhance
   the SVE contaminant recovery compared to conditions where the liquid
   does not spread. Experiments were conducted with spreading volatile oils
   hexane and heptane in wet porous media and capillary tubes, where
   spreading was observed at the scale of centimeters. Within porous medium
   columns up to a meter in height containing stagnant gas, spreading was
   less than ten centimeters and did not contribute significantly to hexane
   volatilization. Water film thinning and oil film pinning may have
   prevented significant oil film spreading, and thus did not enhance SVE
   at the scale of a meter. The experiments performed indicate that
   volatile oil spreading at the field scale is unlikely to contribute
   significantly to the efficiency of SVE. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The interactions between cement and a clayey host-rock of an underground
   repository for intermediate-level radioactive waste are studied with the
   reactive transport code HYTEC for supporting performance assessment.
   Care is taken in using relevant time scales (100,000 years) and
   dimensions. Based on a literature review, three hypotheses are
   considered with respect to the mineralogical composition of the
   claystone and the neo-formed phases. In the long term, the pH is
   buffered for all hypotheses and important mineral transformations occur
   both in cement and the host-rock. The destruction of the primary
   minerals is localized close to the cement/claystone interface and is
   characterized by the precipitation of secondary phases with retention
   properties (illite, zeolite). However, beyond the zone of intense
   mineral transformations, the pore water chemistry is also disturbed over
   a dozen meters due to an attenuated but continuous flux of hydroxyl,
   potassium and calcium ions. Four interdependent mechanisms control the
   profile in the whole system: diffusion of the alkaline plume,
   mineralogical buffering, ion exchange and clogging of the pore space at
   the cement/claystone interface. The migration of a selected group of
   radionuclides (Cs, Ra, Tc and U) is explicitly integrated in the
   simulations of the strongly coupled system. Theoretical profiles of
   distribution coefficient (Kd) and solubility limit values are derived
   from the simulations, and their sensitivity with respect to the system
   evolution is estimated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion experiments in compacted bentonite have been carried out in
   situ using the borehole laboratory CHEMLAB. The ``ordinary{''} anion
   iodide and the redox-sensitive pertechnetate ion have been investigated.
   In spite of strongly reducing groundwater conditions, technetium was
   found to diffuse mostly unreduced as TcO4-, although in some spots in
   the compacted clay, the activity was significantly higher, which may be
   explained by reduction of some TcO4- by iron-containing minerals in the
   bentonite.
   The measured concentration profiles in the clay cannot be accommodated
   by assuming one single diffusion process. The experimental data are
   modeled assuming two diffusion paths, intralamellar diffusion and
   diffusion in external water. The apparent diffusivity for the
   intralamellar diffusion was found to be 8.6 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1) for
   iodide with a capacity factor of 0.1, while the apparent diffusivity for
   the diffusion in external water was found to be 5 x 10(-14) m(2) s(-1)
   with alpha = 2.26. The corresponding values for Tc were found to be D-a
   = 6 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1), alpha = 0.1 and D-a = 1 x 10(-13) m(2) s(-1),
   alpha = 0.46, respectively.
   The diffusion constants and capacity factors obtained in this study are
   in accordance with data from laboratory experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fractures and biopores can act as preferential flow paths in clay
   aquitards and may rapidly transmit contaminants into underlying
   aquifers. Reliable numerical models for assessment of groundwater
   contamination from such aquitards are needed for planning, regulatory
   and remediation purposes. In this investigation, high resolution
   preferential water-saturated flow and bromide transport data were used
   to evaluate the suitability of equivalent porous medium (EPM), dual
   porosity (DP) and discrete fracture/matrix diffusion (DFMD) numerical
   modeling approaches for assessment of flow and non-reactive solute
   transport in clayey till. The experimental data were obtained from four
   large undisturbed soil columns (taken from 1.5 to 3.5 m depth) in which
   biopores and channels along fractures controlled 96-99\% of
   water-saturated flow. Simulating the transport data with the EPM
   effective porosity model (FRACTRAN in EPM mode) was not successful
   because calibrated effective porosity for the same column had to be
   varied up to 1 order of magnitude in order to simulate solute
   breakthrough for the applied flow rates between 11 and 49 mm/day.
   Attempts to simulate the same data with the DP models CXTFIT and
   MODFLOW/MT3D were also unsuccessful because fitted values for
   dispersion, mobile zone porosity, and mass transfer coefficient between
   mobile and immobile zones varied several orders of magnitude for the
   different flow rates, and because dispersion values were furthermore not
   physically realistic. Only the DFMD modeling approach (FRACTRAN in DFMD
   mode) was capable to simulate the observed changes in solute transport
   behavior during alternating flow rate without changing values of
   calibrated fracture spacing and fracture aperture to represent the
   macropores. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A theoretical and experimental study of cation exchange in high ionic
   strength electrolytes was performed using pristine subsurface sediments
   from the U.S. Department of Energy Hanford site. These sediments are
   representative of the site contaminated sediments impacted by release of
   high level waste (HLW) solutions containing Cs-137(+) in NaNO3 brine.
   The binary exchange behavior of Cs+-Na+, Cs+-K+, and Na+-K+ was measured
   over a range in electrolyte concentration. Vanselow selectivity
   coefficients (K-v) that were calculated from the experimental data using
   Pitzer model ion activity corrections for aqueous species showed
   monotonic increases with increasing electrolyte concentrations. The
   influence of electrolyte concentration was greater on the exchange of
   Na+-Cs+ than K+-Cs+, an observation consistent with the differences in
   ion hydration energy of the exchanging cations. A previously developed
   two-site ion exchange model {[}Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 66 (2002)
   193] was modified to include solvent (water) activity changes in the
   exchanger phase through application of the Gibbs-Duhem equation. This
   water activity-corrected model well described the ionic strength effect
   on binary Cs+ exchange, and was extended to the ternary exchange system
   of Cs+-Na+-K+ on the pristine sediment. The model was also used to
   predict Cs-137(+) distribution between sediment and aqueous phase (K-d)
   beneath a leaked HLW tank in Hanfordd's S-SX tank using the analytical
   aqueous data from the field and the binary ion exchange coefficients for
   the pristine sediment. The K-d predictions closely followed the trend in
   the field data and were improved by consideration of water activity
   effects that were considerable in certain regions of the vadose zone
   plume. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Operator-splitting (OS) techniques are very attractive for numerical
   modelling of reactive transport, but they induce some errors.
   Considering reactive mass transport with reversible and irreversible
   reactions governed by a first-order rate law, we develop analytical
   solutions of the mass balance for the following operator-splitting
   schemes: standard sequential non-iterative (SNI), Strang-splitting SNI,
   standard sequential iterative (SI), extrapolating SI, and symmetric SI
   approaches. From these analytical solutions, the operator-splitting
   methods are compared with respect to mass balance errors and convergence
   rates independently of the techniques used for solving each operator.
   Dimensionless times, N-OS, are defined. They control mass balance errors
   and convergence rates. The following order in terms of decreasing
   efficiency is proposed: symmetric SI, Strang-splitting SNI, standard
   SNI, extrapolating SI and standard SI schemes. The symmetric SI scheme
   does not induce any operator-splitting errors, the Strang-splitting SNI
   appears to be O(N-OS(2)) accurate, and the other schemes are first-order
   accurate. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) schemes using MnO4- have been
   effective in destroying chlorinated organic solvents dissolved in ground
   water. Laboratory experiments and field pilot tests reveal that the
   precipitation of Mn oxide, one of the reaction products, causes a
   reduction of permeability, which can lead to flow bypassing and
   inefficiency of the scheme. Without a solution to this problem of
   plugging, it is difficult to remove DNAPL from the subsurface
   completely. In a companion paper, we showed with batch experiments that
   Mn oxide can be dissolved rapidly with certain organic acids. This study
   utilizes 2-D flow-tank experiments to examine the possibility of nearly
   complete DNAPL removal by ISCO with MnO4-, when organic acids are used
   to remove Mn oxide. The experiments were conducted in a small 2-D glass
   flow tank containing a lenticular silica-sand medium. Blue-dyed
   trichloroethylene (TCE) provided residual, the perched and pooled DNAPL.
   KMnO4 at 200 mg/l was flushed through the DNAPL horizontally. Once
   plugging reduced permeability and prevented further delivery of the
   oxidant, citric or oxalic acids were pumped into the flow tank to
   dissolve the Mn oxide precipitates. Organic ligands removed the Mn oxide
   precipitates relatively quickly, and permitted another cycle of MnO4-
   flooding. Cycles of MnO4-/acid flooding continued until all of the
   visible DNAPL was removed. The experiments were monitored with chemical
   analysis and visualization. A mass-balance calculation indicated that by
   the end of the experiments, all the DNAPL was removed. The results show
   also how heterogeneity adds complexity to initial redistribution of
   DNAPL, and to the efficiency of the chemical flooding. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was used to monitor the movement
   of a fluorinated hydrocarbon dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)
   through a saturated porous medium within a laboratory column. Impedance
   measurements were made using a horizontal plane of 12 electrodes
   positioned at regular intervals around the centre of the column. A 2D
   inversion algorithm, which incorporated the cylindrical geometry of the
   column, was used to reconstruct resistivity and phase images from the
   measured data. Differential time-lapse images of DNAPL movement past the
   plane of electrodes were generated by the cell-by-cell subtraction of
   resistivity and phase baseline models from those associated with the
   DNAPL release stage of the experiment.
   The DNAPL pulse was clearly delineated as resistive anomalies in the
   differential time-lapse resistivity images. The spatial extent of the
   resistive anomalies indicated that in addition to vertical migration,
   some lateral spreading of the DNAPL had occurred. Residual contamination
   could be detected after quasi-static conditions were reestablished.
   Residual DNAPL saturation was estimated from the resistivity model data
   by applying Archie's second equation.
   Despite significant measured phase changes due to DNAPL contamination,
   the differential phase images revealed only weak anomalies associated
   with DNAPL flow; these anomalies could be seen only in the initial
   stages of the experiment during peak flow through the plane of
   electrodes. (C) 2003 NERC. Published by Elsevier B.V.. All rights

Abstract = {{To quantify the effects of temperature on the diffusivity of deuterated
   water (HDO) in compacted sodium bentonite, through-diffusion experiments
   were conducted at elevated temperatures ranging from 298 to 333 K.
   Kunipia F (Na-montmorillonite content >98 wt.\%; Kunimine Industries)
   was compacted to a dry density of 0.9 or 1.35 Mg/m(3). As
   montmorillonite particles were oriented perpendicular to the direction
   of compaction, the anisotropy of diffusivity was investigated both
   parallel and normal to the preferred orientation of the montmorillonite.
   The effective diffusion coefficient D, of HDO was larger when the
   diffusional direction was parallel as opposed to normal to the preferred
   orientation for both dry densities. The magnitude of D, and the
   anisotropy for HDO were in good accordance with previously reported
   results for tritiated water at room temperature. Activation energies of
   De were isotropic and increased with increasing dry density over the
   range of 19-25 kJ/ mol. This relationship was considered to be due to
   both pore structure development and the high activation energy of water
   near the montmorillonite surface. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Previous studies on in situ chemical oxidation of trichloroethylene
   (TCE) with potassium permanganate indicated that the solid reaction
   product, Mn oxide, could reduce the permeability of the porous medium
   and impact the success of dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)
   removal. In order to address the issue of permeability reduction caused
   by precipitation, this study investigated the mineralogy of Mn oxides
   and the possibilities of removing the solid precipitates by dissolution.
   The solid reaction product from the oxidation of WE by permanganate is
   semi-amorphous potassium-rich birnessite, which has a layered mineral
   structure with an interlayer spacing of 7.3 Angstrom The chemical
   formula is K(0.854)Mn(1.786)O(4)(.)1.55H(2)O. It has a relatively small
   specific surface area at 23.6 +/- 0.82 m(2)/g. Its point of zero charge
   (pzc) was measured as 3.7 +/- 0.4. This birnessite is a relatively
   active species and could participate in various reactions with existing
   organic and inorganic matter. The dissolution kinetics of Mn oxide was
   evaluated in batch experiments using solutions of citric acid, oxalic
   acid, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Initial dissolution
   rates were determined to be 0.126 mM/m(2)/h for citric acid, 1.35
   mM/m(2) /h for oxalic acid, and 5.176 mM/m(2)/h for EDTA. These rates
   compare with 0.0025 mM/m(2)/h for nitric acid at pH = 2. Organic acids
   dissolve Mn oxide quickly. Reaction rates increase with acid
   concentration, as tested with citric acid. The dissolution mechanism
   likely involves proton and ligand-promoted dissolution and reductive
   dissolution. Citric and oxalic acid can induce ligand-promoted
   dissolution, while EDTA can induce ligand-promoted and reductive
   dissolutions. At low pH, proton-promoted dissolution seems to occur with
   all the acids tested, but this process is not dominant. Reductive
   dissolution appears to be the most effective process in dissolving the
   solid, followed by ligand-promoted dissolution. These experiments
   indicate the significant potential in using these organic acids to
   remove precipitates formed during the oxidation reaction, (C) 2003

Abstract = {{An attempt has been made to estimate quantitatively cation concentration
   changes as estuary water invades a Triassic Sandstone aquifer in
   northwest England. Cation exchange capacities and selectivity
   coefficients for Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were measured in the laboratory
   using standard techniques. Selectivity coefficients were also determined
   using a method involving optimized back-calculation from flushing
   experiments, thus permitting better representation of field conditions;
   in all cases, the Gaines-Thomas/constant cation exchange capacity (CEC)
   model was found to be a reasonable, though not perfect, first
   description. The exchange parameters interpreted from the laboratory
   experiments were used in a one-dimensional reactive transport mixing
   cell model, and predictions compared with field pumping well data (Cl
   and hardness spanning a period of around 40 years, and full major ion
   analyses in similar to 1980). The concentration patterns predicted using
   Gaines-Thomas exchange with calcite equilibrium were similar to the
   observed patterns, but the concentrations of the divalent ions were
   significantly overestimated, as were 1980 sulphate concentrations, and
   1980 alkalinity concentrations were underestimated. Including
   representation of sulphate reduction in the estuarine alluvium failed to
   replicate 1980 HCO3 and pH values. However, by including partial CO2
   degassing following sulphate reduction, a process for which there is 34
   S and 180 evidence from a previous study, a good match for SO4, HCO3,
   and pH was attained. Using this modified estuary water and averaged
   values from the laboratory ion exchange parameter determinations, good
   predictions for the field cation data were obtained. It is concluded
   that the Gaines-Thomas/constant exchange capacity model with averaged
   parameter values can be used successfully in ion exchange predictions in
   this aquifer at a regional scale and over extended time scales, despite
   the, numerous assumptions inherent in the approach; this has also been
   found to be the case in the few other published studies of regional ion
   exchanging flow. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a simple analytical solution for one-dimensional steady heat
   transfer with convection and conduction through a multilayer system such
   as a vadose zone. We assume that each layer is homogeneous and has a
   constant thermal diffusivity. The mass/heat flow direction is
   perpendicular to the layers, and the mass flow rate is a constant. The
   analytical solution presented in this study also assumes constant known
   temperatures at the two boundaries of the system. Although the
   analytical solution gives the temperature as a function of a few
   parameters, we focus on the inverse application to estimate the
   percolation rate in a vadose zone. Example applications have shown that
   with reliable field observation data, the solution can be used to
   determine the percolation rate to high degree of accuracy (e.g., to
   mm/year). In some other cases, the solution may also be helpful in
   characterizing potential lateral flow along layer divides. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A solute transport model that describes nonequilibrium adsorption in
   soil/groundwater systems by mass transfer equations for film and
   intraparticle diffusion is presented. The model is useful in cases where
   breakthrough curve spreading cannot be explained by dispersion only. To
   evaluate its validity, the model was applied to several data sets from
   column experiments. The validity was also proved by a comparison with an
   analytical solution for the limiting case of predominating dispersion.
   Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate the
   influence of different process and sorption parameters (pore water
   velocity, intraparticle mass transfer coefficient, isotherm
   nonlinearity) on the shape of the calculated breakthrough curves. The
   application of the proposed model is discussed in comparison to the
   widely used dispersed flow/local equilibrium model, and a relationship
   between both models, which is based on a lumped parameter approach, is
   shown. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{New in situ reactive barrier technologies were tested nearby a local
   aquifer in Bitterfeld, Saxonia-Anhalt, Germany, which is polluted mainly
   by chlorobenzene (CB), in concentrations up to 450 muM. A reactor filled
   with original aquifer sediment was designed for the microbiological
   remediation of the ground water by indigenous bacterial communities. Two
   remediation variants were examined: (a) the degradation of CB under
   anoxic conditions in the presence of nitrate; (b) the degradation of CB
   under mixed electron acceptor conditions (oxygen + nitrate) using
   hydrogen peroxide as the oxygen-releasing compound. Under anoxic
   conditions, no definite degradation of CB was observed. Adding hydrogen
   peroxide (2.94 mM) and nitrate (2 mM) led to the disappearance of CB
   (ca. 150 muM) in the lower part of the reactor, accompanied by a strong
   increase of the number of cultivable aerobic CB degrading bacteria in
   reactor water and sediment samples, indicating that CB was degraded
   mainly by productive bacterial metabolism. Several aerobic CB degrading
   bacteria, mostly belonging to the genera Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus,
   were isolated from reactor water and sediments. In laboratory
   experiments with reactor water, oxygen was rapidly released by hydrogen
   peroxide, whereas biotic-induced decomposition reactions of hydrogen
   peroxide were almost four times faster than abiotic-induced
   decomposition reactions. A clear chemical degradation of CB mediated by
   hydrogen peroxide was not observed. CB was also completely degraded in
   the reactor after reducing the hydrogen peroxide concentration to 880
   muM. The CB degradation completely collapsed after reducing the hydrogen
   peroxide concentration to 440 muM. In the following, the hydrogen
   peroxide concentrations were increased again (to 880 muM, 2.94 mM, and
   880 muM, respectively), but the oxygen demand for CB degradation was
   higher than observed before, indicating a shift in the bacterial
   population. During the whole experiment, nitrate was uniformly reduced
   during the flow path in the reactor. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sulfonated naphthalene formaldehyde condensates (SNFC) and their
   monomeric analogues were used as superplasticizers for cement suspension
   injections at two tunnel construction sites that are in direct contact
   with groundwater. Because in one case the aquifer is an important
   drinking water resource, the behavior of SNFC in the groundwater was
   carefully investigated. Chemical analyses showed that SNFC leached to
   the groundwater in concentrations of up to 58 mug/l of total SNFC at a
   distance of about 60 m down-gradient from the construction site. Of the
   individual SNFC components, only monomers and oligomers with up to four
   units could be detected in the groundwater. Oligomers with more than
   four units did not leach from the cement paste. The leached oligomers
   were transported in the groundwater at different velocities, which can
   be explained by sorption experiments. Mass fluxes of SNFC used at the
   tunnel construction sites were evaluated. Most SNFC were immobilized in
   the cement, but 5\% (w/w) of the applied SNFC were found to leach into
   the aquifer. This corresponds to a total amount of leached SNFC of
   approximately 100 kg, of which about 80\% are biodegraded in the aquifer
   and 20\% (20 kg) still remain in the groundwater. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Minimum relative entropy (MRE) and Tikhonov regularization (TR) were
   compared by Neupauer et al. {[}Water Resour. Res. 36 (2000) 2469] on the
   basis of an example plume source reconstruction problem originally
   proposed by Skaggs and Kabala {[}Water Resour. Res. 30 (1994) 71] and a
   boxcar-like function. Although Neupauer et al. {[}Water Resour. Res. 36
   (2000) 2469] were careful in their conclusions to note the basis of
   these comparisons, we show that TR does not perform well on problems in
   which delta-like sources are convolved with diffuse-groundwater
   contamination response functions, particularly in the presence of noise.
   We also show that it is relatively easy to estimate an appropriate value
   for c, the hyperparameter needed in the minimum relative entropy
   solution for the inverse problem in the presence of noise. This can be
   estimated in a variety of ways, including estimation from the data
   themselves, analysis of data residuals, and a rigorous approach using
   the real cepstrum and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Regardless
   of the approach chosen, for the sample problem reported herein,
   excellent resolution of multiple delta-like spikes is produced from MIZE
   from noisy, diffuse data. The usefulness of MRE for noisy inverse
   problems has been demonstrated. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Agrochemical transport in soils is complicated and involves physical,
   chemical and biochemical reactions; its mathematical modelling remains a
   challenging task. This paper presents a lattice Boltzmann model to
   simulate the agrochemical movement. The lattice Boltzmann model is a
   microscopic and process-based model, simulating the transport process by
   tracking chemical particles. The model presented in this paper is for
   one-dimensional vertical leaching and assumes that the chemical
   particles at the microscopic level move in five directions: one
   stagnant, two in vertical direction and two in an internal horizontal
   direction bounded by two reactive walls. Reactions at the walls are
   assumed to take place at two different rates, one in fast rate where the
   chemicals in the solution and on the wall are in an instant equilibrium,
   and the other in slow rate where the mass exchange rate between the
   chemicals in the solution and on the wall is a first-order kinetic. The
   reactions on both walls are assumed to occur instantly when the chemical
   particles moving in the internal direction hit the walls. To test the
   model, we measured the leaching of atrazine through soil columns in the
   laboratory. The results simulated with the lattice Boltzmann model are
   compared with the measured breakthrough curves and the non-equilibrium
   two-site convection-dispersion model; they all show close agreement. The
   transport parameters needed in the models are obtained from the
   measurement of adsorption isotherm of atrazine, bromide leaching in the
   same soil columns and calibration. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) mixtures with the goal of comparing the
   relative contributions of multicomponent (intra-NAPL) diffusion, film
   transfer and thermodynamic nonideality. These contributions are compared
   at the pore scale and intermediate scale (several centimeters downstream
   from the source). Trichloroethene (TCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE) and
   1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) were selected to model a reasonably ideal
   mixture; TCE, PCE and octanol were selected as a relevant nonideal
   mixture. A multicomponent diffusion-based dissolution model
   incorporating hydrodynamic theory was formulated to estimate intra-NAPL
   concentration gradients and associated aqueous interfacial
   concentrations for ideally shaped (spherical) NAPL blobs. Pore scale
   dissolution times for this model were compared to those generated using
   the conventional well-mixed NAPL dissolution model, applying the same
   film transfer boundary condition in both cases. Activity coefficients
   (spatially and temporally variable for the diffusion model, temporally
   variable for the well-mixed model) were estimated using UNIFAC. NAPL
   interfacial concentration histories generated using the pore scale
   models were used as input in a three-dimensional groundwater transport
   model (MT3DMS) to compare downstream concentration distributions. For
   the relatively large NAPL bodies simulated (r = 0.6 cm), intra-NAPL
   diffusion effects were found to be significant at the pore scale and
   were strongly impacted by the mixture's thermodynamic ideality. At the
   intermediate scale, and for the conditions tested, modest differences in
   the simulations suggested that intra-NAPL diffusion effects would be
   negligible compared to those associated with mixture composition
   uncertainty, dissolution rate processes related to NAPL-induced
   permeability effects and hydrodynamic issues associated with flow field
   heterogeneity. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A common aspect of innovative remediation techniques is that they tend
   to reduce the interfacial tension between the aqueous and non-aqueous
   phase liquids, resulting in mobilization of the organic contaminant.
   This complicates the remediation of aquifers, contaminated with Dense
   Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs), as they are likely to migrate
   downwards, deeper into the aquifer and into finer layers. A possible
   solution is the use of swelling alcohols, which tend to reduce the
   density difference between the aqueous phase and the DNAPL. To avoid
   premature mobilization upon the initial contact between the DNAPL and
   the alcohol, several researchers have proposed the use of vertical
   upward flow of the alcohol. In this paper, we present an equation, which
   describes the upward mobilization of both continuous and discontinuous
   DNAPLs and so the important parameters governing the upward controlled
   mobilization of the DNAPL. The need and required magnitude of this
   specific discharge was investigated by conducting four column
   experiments in which the initial density of the DNAPL and the
   permeability was varied. It was shown that the required flow velocities
   increase with the permeability of the porous medium and the initial
   density difference between the aqueous phase and the DNAPL. Whenever the
   specific discharge falls below the critical value, the DNAPL moves
   downward. A second set of column experiments looked at the impact of
   permeability of porous medium on the solubilization and mobilization of
   DNAPL during alcohol flooding. Columns, packed with coarse or fine sand,
   containing a residual trichloroethylene (TCE) or perchloroethylene (PCE)
   saturation were flushed with the alcohol mixture at a fixed specific
   discharge rate. The induced pressure gradients in the aqueous phase,
   which were higher in the fine sand, resulted for this porous medium in
   extensive mobilization of the DNAPL against the direction of the
   buoyancy force. The density of the first NAPL coming out of the top of
   the fine sand was close to that of the pure DNAPL. In the coarser sand,
   the pressure gradients were sufficient to prevent downward migration of
   the DNAPL, but upward mobilization was minimal. The predominant removal
   mechanism in this case was the much slower solubilization. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A conceptual model is proposed to explain the transport behavior of
   plutonium in laboratory columns packed with a sandy coastal soil from
   the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)'s Savannah River Site. The column
   transport experiments involved the introduction of a finite step input
   of plutonium, predominately in the +5 oxidation state, into the columns
   followed by elution with a low-carbonate solution of 0.02 M NaClO4 at pH
   3, 5, and 8. Total plutonium concentrations were measured in the
   effluent as a function of time. These elution profiles suggest at least
   two distinct physical/chemical forms of plutonium, each with a different
   mobility. To explain the observed behavior, the following conceptual
   model was evaluated: {[}1] equilibrium partitioning of plutonium (V) and
   plutonium (IV) between the aqueous and sorbed phases as defined by
   pH-dependent, oxidation-state specific distribution coefficients and
   {[}2] kinetic reduction of plutonium (V) to plutonium (IV) in the sorbed
   phase. The conceptual model was applied to the column experiments
   through a one-dimensional advective/dispersive mathematical model, and
   predictions of the mathematical model were compared with the
   experimental data. Overall, the model was successful in predicting some
   of the major features observed in the experiments. It also yielded
   quantitative estimates of the rate constant for surface mediated
   reduction of plutonium (V) to plutonium (IV) that were of the same order
   (10(-4) to 10(-5) s(-1)) as those calculated from batch data both for
   this soil and for goethite. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical diffusion of NaI solution from a horizontal fracture into
   and within the surrounding matrix was tracked and quantified over time
   using an artificially fractured chalk core (30 x 5 cm) and a
   second-generation X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanner. The different
   tracer-penetration distances imaged in the matrix above and below the
   horizontal fracture are indicative of a greater tracer mass penetrating
   into the lower matrix. The enhanced transport in the matrix below the
   fracture was related to the Rayleigh-Darcy instability induced by the
   density differences between the heavier tracer solution in the fracture
   (1.038) and the distilled water that had initially resided in the
   matrix. Our observations suggest that below the fracture, the tracer is
   propagated by an advection-diffusion process that is characterized by
   both higher rates and higher concentrations relative to its propagation
   by diffusion above the fracture. The experimental results suggest that
   the prediction of contaminant migration in a rock intersected by both
   vertical and horizontal (e.g. along bedding planes) fractures is
   difficult because of density effects that result in different
   solute-penetration rates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted at Canadian Forces Base Borden (CFB
   Borden) to assess the air distribution from a single in situ air
   sparging injection point. This aquifer consists of fine to medium sand
   deposited in horizontal layers. The permeability at the study location
   varied from 10(-10) to 10(-14) m(2) and distinct low permeability
   horizons were present at approximately 1.2, 2.0, and 2.9 m below the
   water table. Prior to air injection, a 15 x 15-m portion of the vadose
   zone was excavated to the water table (similar to 1 m below ground
   surface) in order to visually observe air release distribution at the
   water table. The water table was actively maintained 5 cm above the
   excavated surface.
   The sparging system operated for a period of 7 days with an injection
   flow rate of 200 m(3)/days (5 scfm). The resulting subsurface air
   distribution was assessed using a variety of techniques including
   neutron logging, borehole and surface ground penetrating radar,
   piezometric head measurements, surface visualization, and hydraulic
   testing. Through this combination of tests, it was demonstrated that
   variations in permeability and, hence, capillary pressure at the site
   were sufficient to cause the injected air to spread laterally, forming
   stratigraphically trapped air pockets beneath the low permeability
   horizons. The formation of these air pockets eventually resulted in a
   buildup of capillary pressure that exceeded the air entry pressure and
   allowed some air to migrate up through the lower permeability layers.
   Each of the assessment techniques employed generated information at
   different spatial scales that prevented a direct comparison of the
   results from the various techniques; however, the results from all
   techniques proved to be critical in the interpretation of the
   experimental data. As a consequence, the different assessment techniques
   should not be viewed as alternatives, but rather as complimentary
   techniques. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional multiphase flow and transport simulators were refined
   and used to numerically investigate the entrapment and dissolution
   behavior of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in heterogeneous porous media
   containing spatial variations in wettability. Measured hydraulic
   properties, residual saturations, and dissolution parameters were
   employed in these simulations. Entrapment was quantified using
   experimentally verified hydraulic property and residual saturation
   models that account for hysteresis and wettability variations. The
   nonequilibrium dissolution of PCE was modeled using independent
   estimates of the film mass transfer coefficient and interfacial area for
   entrapped and continuous (PCE pools or films) saturations. Flow
   simulations demonstrate that the spatial distribution of PCE is highly
   dependent on subsurface wettability characteristics that create
   differences in PCE retention mechanisms and the presence of subsurface
   capillary barriers. For a given soil texture, the maximum and minimum
   PCE infiltration depth was obtained when the sand had intermediate (an
   organic-wet mass fraction of 25\%) and strong (water- or organic-wet)
   wettability conditions, respectively. In heterogeneous systems,
   subsurface wettability variations were also found to enhance or diminish
   the performance of soil texture-induced capillary barriers. The
   dissolution behavior of PCE was found to depend on the soil wettability
   and the spatial PCE distribution. Shorter dissolution times tended to
   occur when PCE was distributed over large regions due to an increased
   access of flowing water to the PCE. In heterogeneous systems, capillary
   barriers that produced high PCE saturations tended to exhibit longer
   dissolution times. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In the Negev desert, Israel, a chemical industrial complex is located
   over fractured Eocene chalk formations where transfer of water and
   solutes between fracture voids and matrix pores affects migration of
   contaminants in the fractures due to diffusion into the chalk matrix.
   This study tests sorption and sorption competition between contaminants
   in the chalk matrix to make it possible to evaluate the potential for
   contaminant attenuation during transport in fractures.
   Single solute sorption isotherms on chalk matrix material for five
   common contaminants (m-xylene, ametryn, 1,2-dichloroethane,
   phenanthrene, and 2,4,6-tribromophenol) were found to be nonlinear, as
   confirmed in plots of K-d versus initial solution concentration. Over
   the studied concentration ranges, m-xylene K-d varied by more than a
   factor of 100, ametryn K-d by a factor of 4, 1,2-dichloroethane K-d by
   more than a factor of 3, phenanthrene K-d by about a factor of 2, and
   2,4,6-tribromophenol K-d by a factor of 10. It was earlier found that
   sorption is to the organic matter component of the chalk matrix and not
   to the mineral phases (Chemosphere 44 (2001) 1121). Nonlinear sorption
   isotherms indicate that there is at least some finite sorption domain.
   Bi-solute competition experiments with 2,4,6-tribromophenol as the
   competitor were designed to explore the nature of the finite sorption
   domain. All of the isotherms in the bi-solute experiments are more
   linear than in the single solute experiments, as confirmed by smaller
   variations in Kd as a function of initial solution concentration. For
   both m-xylene and ametryn, there is a small nonlinear component or
   domain that was apparently not susceptible to competition by
   2,4,6-tribromophenol. The nonlinear sorption domain(s) is best expressed
   at low solution concentrations. Inert-solvent-normalized single and
   bi-solute sorption isotherms demonstrate that ametryn undergoes specific
   force interactions with the chalk sorbent. The volume percent of
   phenanthrene sorbed at the liquid solubility limit is calculated to be
   13\% v:v in both the single and bi-solute experiments. This value
   exceeds what may be reasonably interpreted as partitioning of
   phenanthrene into organic matter, despite the relative linearity of the
   phenanthrene sorption isotherm (compared with other compounds) in both
   single and bi-solute systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Evolution of trimethylbenzoic acids in the KC-135 aquifer at the former
   Wurtsmith Air Force Base (WAFB), Oscoda, MI was examined to determine
   the functionality of trimethylbenzoic acids as key metabolite signatures
   in the biogeochemical evolution of an aquifer contaminated with JP-4
   fuel hydrocarbons. Changes in the composition of trimethylbenzoic acids
   and the distribution and concentration profiles exhibited by 2,4,6- and
   2,3,5-trimethylbenzoic acids temporally and between multilevel wells
   reflect processes indicative of an actively evolving contaminant plume.
   The concentration levels of trimethylbenzoic acids were 3-10 orders
   higher than their tetramethylbenzene precursors, a condition attributed
   to slow metabolite turnover under sulfidogenic conditions. The observed
   degradation of tetramethylbenzenes into trimethylbenzoic acids obviates
   the use of these alkylbenzenes as non-labile tracers for other
   degradable aromatic hydrocarbons, but provides rare field evidence on
   the range of high molecular weight alkylbenzenes and isomeric
   assemblages amenable to anaerobic degradation in situ. The coupling of
   actual tetramethylbenzene loss with trimethylbenzoic acid production and
   the general decline in the concentrations of these compounds demonstrate
   the role of microbially mediated processes in the natural attenuation of
   hydrocarbons and may be a key indicator in the overall rate of
   hydrocarbon degradation and the biogeochemical evolution of the KC-135
   aquifer. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The relevant velocity that describes transport phenomena in a porous
   medium is the pore velocity. For this reason, one needs not only to
   describe the variability of transmissivity, which fully determines the
   Darcy velocity field for given source terms and boundary conditions, but
   also any variability of the pore volume. We demonstrate that
   hydraulically equivalent media with exactly the same transmissivity
   field can produce dramatic differences in the displacement of a solute
   if they have different pore volume distributions. In particular, we
   demonstrate that correlation between pore volume and transmissivity
   leads to a much smoother and more homogeneous solute distribution. This
   was observed in a laboratory experiment performed in artificial
   fractures made of two plexiglass plates into which a space-dependent
   aperture distribution was milled. Using visualization by a light
   transmission technique, we observe that the solute behaviour is much
   smoother and more regular after the fractures are filled with glass
   powder, which plays the role of a homogeneous fault gouge material. This
   is due to a perfect correlation between pore volume and transmissivity
   that causes pore velocity to be not directly dependent on the
   transmissivity, but only indirectly through the hydraulic gradient,
   which is a much smoother function due to the diffusive behaviour of the
   flow equation acting as a filter. This smoothing property of the pore
   volume-transmissivity correlation is also supported by numerical
   simulations of tracer tests in a dipole flow field. Three different
   conceptual models are used: an empty fracture, a rough-walled fracture
   filled with a homogeneous material and a parallel-plate fracture with a
   heterogeneous fault gouge. All three models are hydraulically
   equivalent, yet they have a different pore volume distribution. Even if
   piezometric heads and specific flow rates are exactly the same at any
   point of the domain, the transport process differs dramatically. These
   differences make it important to discriminate in situ among different
   conceptual models in order to simulate correctly the transport
   phenomena. For this reason, we study the solute breakthrough and
   recovery curves at the extraction wells. Our numerical case studies show
   that discrimination on the basis of such data might be impossible except
   under very favourable conditions, i.e. the integral scale of the
   transmissivity field has to be known and small compared to the dipole
   size. If the latter conditions are satisfied, discrimination between the
   rough-walled fracture filled with a homogeneous material and the other
   two models becomes possible, whereas the parallel-plate fracture with a
   heterogeneous fault gouge and the empty fracture still show
   identifiability problems. The latter may be solved by inspection of
   aperture and pressure testing. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Cs+ transport experiments carried out in columns packed with
   uncontaminated Hanford formation sediment from the SX tank farm provide
   strong support for the use of a multisite, multicomponent cation
   exchange model to describe Cs+ migration in the Hanford vadose zone. The
   experimental results indicate a strong dependence of the effective Cs+
   K-d on the concentrations of other cations, including Na+ that is
   present at high to extremely high concentrations in fluids leaking from
   the Hanford SX tanks. A strong dependence of the Cs+ K-d on the aqueous
   Cs+ concentration is also apparent, with retardation of Cs+ increasing
   from a value of 41 at a Cs+ concentration of 10(-4) M in the feed
   solution to as much as 282 at a Cs+ concentration of 5 x 10(-7) M, all
   in a background of 1 M NaNO3. The total cation exchange capacity (CEC)
   of the Hanford sediment was determined using Na-22 isotopic equilibrium
   exchange in a flow-through column experiment. The value for the CEC of
   120 mueq/g determined with this method is compatible with a value of
   121.9 mueq/g determined by multi-cation elution. While two distinct
   exchange sites were proposed by Zachara et al. {[}Geochim. Cosmochim.
   Acta 66 (2002) 193] based on binary batch exchange experiments, a third
   site is proposed in this study to improve the fit of the Cs+-Na+ and
   Cs+-Ca+ exchange data and to capture self-sharpened Cs+ breakthrough
   curves at low concentrations of Cs+. Two of the proposed exchange sites
   represent frayed edge sites (FES) on weathered micas and constitute
   0.02\% and 0.22\% of the total CEC. Both of the FES show a very strong
   selectivity for Cs+ over Na+ (KNa-Cs = 10(7.22) and 10(4.93),
   respectively). The third site, accounting for over 99\% of the total
   CEC, is associated with planar sites on expansible clays and shows a
   smaller Na+-Cs+ selectivity coefficient of 10(1.99).
   Parameters derived from a fit of binary batch experiments alone tend to
   under predict Cs+ retardation in the column experiments. The transport
   experiments indicate 72-90\% of the Cs+ sorbed in experiments targeting
   exchange on FES was desorbed over a 10- and 24-day period, respectively.
   At high Cs+ concentrations, where sorption is controlled primarily by
   exchange on planar sites, 95\% of the Cs+ desorption was desorbed. Most
   of the difficulty in desorbing Cs+ from FES is a result of the extremely
   high selectivity of these sites for Cs+, although truly irreversible
   sorption as high as 23\% was suggested in one experiment. The conclusion
   that Cs+ exchange is largely reversible in a thermodynamic sense is
   supported by the ability to match Cs+ desorption curves almost
   quantitatively with an equilibrium reactive transport simulation. The
   model for Cs+ retardation developed here qualitatively explains the
   behavior of Cs+ in the Hanford vadose zone underneath a variety of
   leaking tanks with differing salt concentrations. The high selectivity
   of FES for Cs+ implies that future desorption and migration is very
   unlikely to occur under natural recharge conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This work considers the applicability of conservative tracers for
   detecting high-saturation nonaqueous-phase liquid (NAPL) entrapment in
   heterogeneous systems. For this purpose, a series of experiments and
   simulations was performed using a two-dimensional heterogeneous system
   (10 x 1.2 m), which represents an intermediate scale between laboratory
   and field scales. Tracer tests performed prior to injecting the NAPL
   provide the baseline response of the heterogeneous porous medium. Two
   NAPL spill experiments were performed and the entrapped-NAPL saturation
   distribution measured in detail using a gamma-ray attenuation system.
   Tracer tests following each of the NAPL spills produced breakthrough
   curves (BTCs) reflecting the impact of entrapped NAPL on conservative
   transport. To evaluate significance, the impact of NAPL entrapment on
   the conservative-tracer breakthrough curves was compared to simulated
   breakthrough curve variability for different realizations of the
   heterogeneous distribution. Analysis of the results reveals that the
   NAPL entrapment has a significant impact on the temporal moments of
   conservative-tracer breakthrough curves. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Inverse modeling of BTEX dissolution and biodegradation at the Bemidji,
   MN crude-oil spill site}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) solute transport and biodegradation
   code BIOMOC was used in conjunction with the USGS universal inverse
   modeling code UCODE to quantify field-scale hydrocarbon dissolution and
   biodegradation at the USGS Toxic Substances Hydrology Program crude-oil
   spill research site located near Bemidji, MN. This inverse modeling
   effort used the extensive historical data compiled at the Bemidji site
   from 1986 to 1997 and incorporated a multicomponent transport and
   biodegradation model. Inverse modeling was successful when coupled
   transport and degradation processes were incorporated into the model and
   a single dissolution rate coefficient was used for all BTEX components.
   Assuming a stationary oil body, we simulated benzene, toluene,
   ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene (BTEX) concentrations in the oil
   and ground water, respectively, as well as dissolved oxygen. Dissolution
   from the oil phase and aerobic and anaerobic degradation processes were
   represented. The parameters estimated were the recharge rate, hydraulic
   conductivity, dissolution rate coefficient, individual first-order BTEX
   anaerobic degradation rates, and transverse dispersivity. Results were
   similar for simulations obtained using several alternative conceptual
   models of the hydrologic system and biodegradation processes. The
   dissolved BTEX concentration data were not sufficient to discriminate
   between these conceptual models. The calibrated simulations reproduced
   the general large-scale evolution of the plume, but did not reproduce
   the observed small-scale spatial and temporal variability in
   concentrations. The estimated anaerobic biodegradation rates for toluene
   and o-xylene were greater than the dissolution rate coefficient.
   However, the estimated anaerobic biodegradation rates for benzene,
   ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylene were less than the dissolution rate
   coefficient. The calibrated model was used to determine the BTEX mass
   balance in the oil body and groundwater plume. Dissolution from the oil
   body was greatest for compounds with large effective solubilities
   (benzene) and with large degradation rates (toluene and o-xylene).
   Anaerobic degradation removed 77\% of the BTEX that dissolved into the
   water phase and aerobic degradation removed 17\%. Although
   goodness-of-fit measures for the alternative conceptual models were not
   significantly different, predictions made with the models were quite
   variable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the description of aqueous dissolution rates for
   explosive compounds enhance the ability to describe these compounds as a
   contaminant source term and to model the behavior of these compounds in
   a field environment. The objective of this study is to make predictions
   concerning the persistence of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and
   octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) in solid form
   both as individual explosive compounds and components of octol, and the
   resultant concentrations of explosives in water as a result of
   dissolution using three exploratory modeling approaches. The selection
   of dissolution model and rate greatly affect not only the predicted
   persistence of explosive compound sources but also their resulting
   concentrations in solution. This study identifies the wide range in
   possible predictions using existing information and these modeling
   approaches to highlight the need for further research to ensure that
   risk assessment, remediation and predicted fate and transport are
   appropriately presented and interpreted. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The operating life of an Fe-0-based permeable reactive barrier (PRB) is
   limited due to chemical reactions of Fe-0 in groundwater. The relative
   contributions from mineral precipitation, gas production, and microbial
   activity to the degradation of PRB performance have been uncertain. In
   this controlled field study, nitrate-rich, site groundwater was treated
   by Fe-0 in large-volume, flow-through columns to monitor the changes in
   chemical and hydraulic parameters over time. Tracer tests showed a close
   relationship between hydraulic residence time and pH measurements. The
   ionic profiles suggest that mineral precipitation and accumulation is
   the primary mechanism for pore clogging around the inlet of the column.
   Accumulated N-2 gas generated by biotic processes also affected the
   hydraulics although the effects were secondary to that of mineral
   precipitation. Quantitative estimates indicate a porosity reduction of
   up to 45.3\% near the column inlet over 72 days of operation under
   accelerated flow conditions. According to this study, preferential flow
   through a PRB at a site with similar groundwater chemistry should be
   detected over similar to 1 year of operation. During the early operation
   of a PRB, pH is a key indicator for monitoring the change in hydraulic
   residence time resulting from heterogeneity development. If the
   surrounding native material is more conductive than the clogged
   Fe-media, groundwater bypass may render the PRB ineffective for treating
   contaminated groundwater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional flow and transport model was developed to describe the
   movement of two fluid phases, gas and water, within a porous medium and
   the transport of Ra-226 and Rn-222 within and between these two phases.
   Included in this model is the vegetative uptake of water and aqueous
   Ra-226 and Rn-222 that can be extracted from the soil via the
   transpiration stream. The mathematical model is formulated through a set
   of phase balance equations and a set of species balance equations. Mass
   exchange, sink terms and the dependence of physical properties upon
   phase composition couple the two sets of equations. Numerical solution
   of each set, with iteration between the sets, is carried out leading to
   a set-iterative compositional model. The Petrov-Galerkin finite element
   approach is used to allow for upstream weighting if required for a given
   simulation. Mass lumping improves solution convergence and stability
   behavior. The resulting numerical model was applied to four problems and
   was found to produce accurate, mass conservative solutions when compared
   to published experimental and numerical results and theoretical column
   experiments. Preliminary results suggest that the model can be used as
   an investigative tool to determine the feasibility of phytoremediating
   radium and radon-contaminated soil. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

   treatment system consists of a zero valent granular iron zone to reduce
   nitrobenzene to aniline, followed by a passive oxygen release zone for
   the aerobic biodegradation of the aniline daughter product using
   pristine aquifer material from Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Borden,
   Ontario, as an initial microbial source. In laboratory batch
   experiments, nitrobenzene was found to reduce quickly in the presence of
   granular iron forming aniline, which was not further degraded but
   remained partially sorbed onto the granular iron surface. Aniline was
   found to be readily biodegraded with little metabolic lag under aerobic
   conditions using the pristine aquifer material. A sequential column
   experiment, containing a granular iron reducing zone and an aerobic
   biodegradation zone, successively degraded nitrobenzene and then aniline
   to below detection limits (0.5 muM) without any noticeable reduction in
   hydraulic conductivity from biofouling, or through the formation of
   precipitates. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two approaches were used to investigate the influence of dissolved
   oxygen (DO) and substrate availability on the formation and dynamics of
   ``bioactive zones{''} in a water-saturated porous medium. A bioactive
   zone is defined as a region where a microbial community is sufficiently
   active to metabolize bioavailable substrates. In the first approach,
   microbial activity was characterized by monitoring the spatial and
   temporal variability of DO and aqueous substrate (salicylate and
   naphthalene) concentrations during miscible-displacement experiments. In
   the second approach, microbial activity was monitored using multiple
   fiber optics emplaced in the porous medium to detect luminescence
   produced by Pseudomonas putida RB1353, a bioluminescent reporter
   organism that produces light when salicylate (an intermediate of
   naphthalene degradation) is present. The results of both approaches show
   that the location and size of the bioactive zones were influenced by in
   situ DO and substrate availability. When DO was not a limiting factor
   (i.e., lower substrate input concentrations), the bioactive zone
   encompassed the entire column, with the majority of the microbial
   activity occurring between the inlet and midpoint. However, as the
   availability of DO became limiting for the higher substrate input
   experiments, the size of the bioactive zone shrank and was ultimately
   limited to the proximity of the column inlet. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Modelling of diffusion-limited retardation of contaminants in
   hydraulically and lithologically nonuniform media}},

Abstract = {{A new reactive transport modelling approach and examples of its
   application are presented, dealing with the impact of
   sorption/desorption kinetics on the spreading of solutes, e.g. organic
   contaminants, in groundwater. Slow sorption/desorption is known from the
   literature to be strongly responsible for the retardation of organic
   contaminants. The modelling concept applied in this paper quantifies
   sorption/desorption kinetics by an intra-particle diffusion approach.
   According to this idea, solute uptake by or release from the aquifer
   material is modelled at small scale by a ``slow{''} diffusion process
   where the diffusion coefficient is reduced as compared to the aqueous
   diffusion coefficient due to (i) the size and shape of intra-particle
   pores and (ii) retarded transport of solutes within intra-particle pores
   governed by a nonlinear sorption isotherm. This process-based concept
   has the advantage of requiring only measurable model parameters, thus
   avoiding fitting parameters like first-order rate coefficients.
   In addition, the approach presented here allows for modelling of slow
   sorption/desorption in lithologically nonuniform media. Therefore, it
   accounts for well-known experimental findings indicating that sorptive
   properties depend on (i) the grain size distribution of the aquifer
   material and (ii) the lithological composition (e.g. percentage of
   quartz, sandstone, limestone, etc.) of each grain size fraction. The
   small-scale physico-chemical model describing sorption/desorption is
   coupled to a large-scale model of groundwater flow and solute transport.
   Consequently, hydraulic heterogeneities may also be considered by the
   overall model. This coupling is regarded as an essential prerequisite
   for simulating field-scale scenarios which will be addressed by a
   forthcoming publication.
   This paper focuses on mathematical model formulation, implementation of
   the numerical code and lab-scale model applications highlighting the
   sorption and desorption behavior of an organic contaminant
   (Phenanthrene) with regard to three lithocomponents exhibiting different
   sorptive properties. In particular, it is shown that breakthrough curves
   (BTCs) for lithologically nonuniform media cannot be obtained via simple
   arithmetic averaging of breakthrough curves for lithologically uniform
   media. In addition, as no analytical solutions are available for model
   validation purposes, simulation results are compared to measurements
   from lab-scale column experiments. The model results indicate that the
   new code can be regarded as a valuable tool for predicting long-term
   contaminant uptake or release, which may last for several hundreds of
   years for some lithocomponents. In particular, breakthrough curves
   simulated by pure forward modelling reproduce experimental data much
   better than a calibrated standard first-order kinetics reactive
   transport model, thus indicating that the new approach is of high
   quality and may be advantageously used for supporting the design of
   remediation strategies at contaminated sites where some lithocomponents
   and/or grain size classes may provide a long-term pollutant source. (C)

Abstract = {{The modeling of transport of organic liquid contaminants through the
   vadose zone often requires three-phase relative permeabilities. Since
   these are difficult to measure, predictive models are usually used. The
   objective of this study is to assess the ability of eight common models
   to predict the drainage relative permeability to oil in a three-phase
   system (water-oil-air). A comparison of the models' estimates using data
   set from Oak {[}Oak, M.J., 1990. Three-phase relative permeability of
   water-wet Berea. In: Seventh Symposium on Enhanced Oil Recovery, Paper
   SPE/Doe 20183. Tulsa, OK, April 22-25] showed that they provide very
   different predictions for the same system. The goodness of the models
   does not increase with the amount of data or computation that the models
   require. Also, the calculations showed how different interpretations of
   the models and of the terminology associated with them can significantly
   impact the predictions. Thus, considerable error may be introduced into
   the simulations of organic liquid transport in the vadose zone depending
   on the selection and interpretation of the three-phase relative
   permeability model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model for the transport of hydrophobic organic
   contaminants in an aquifer under simplistic riverbank filtration
   conditions is developed. The model considers a situation where
   contaminants are present together with dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   and bacteria. The aquifer is conceptualized as a four-phase system: two
   mobile colloidal phases, an aqueous phase, and a stationary solid phase.
   An equilibrium approach is used to describe the interactions of
   contaminants with DOM, bacteria, and solid matrix. The model is composed
   of bacterial transport equation and contaminant transport equation.
   Numerical simulations are performed to examine the contaminant transport
   behavior in the presence of DOM and bacteria. The simulation results
   illustrate that contaminant transport is enhanced markedly in the
   presence of DOM and bacteria, and the impact of DOM on contaminant
   mobility is greater than that of bacteria under examined conditions.
   Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the model is sensitive to changes
   of three lumped parameters: K-1(+) (total affinity of stationary solid
   phase to contaminants), K-2(+) (total affinity of DOM to contaminants),
   and K-3(+) (total affinity of bacteria to contaminants). In a situation
   where contaminants exist simultaneously with DOM and bacteria,
   contaminant transport is mainly affected by a ratio of
   K-1(+)/K-2(+)/K-3(+), which can vary with changes of equilibrium
   distribution coefficient of contaminants and/or colloidal
   concentrations. In riverbank filtration, the influence of DOM and
   bacteria on the transport behavior of contaminants should be accounted
   to accurately predict the contaminant mobility. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Reductive dechlorination of trichloroethene (TCE) by zero-valent iron
   produces a systematic enrichment of C-13 in the remaining substrate that
   can be described using a Rayleigh model. In this study, fractionation
   factors for TCE dechlorination with iron samples from two permeable
   reactive barriers (PRBs) were established in batch experiments. Samples
   included original unused iron as well as material from a barrier in
   Belfast after almost 4 years of operation. Despite the variety of
   samples, carbon isotope fractionations of TCE were remarkably similar
   and seemed to be independent of iron origin, reaction rate, and
   formation of precipitates on the iron surfaces. The average enrichment
   factor for all experiments was - 10.1 parts per thousand (+/- 0.4 parts
   per thousand). These results indicate that the enrichment factor
   provides a powerful tool to monitor the reaction progress, and thus the
   performance, of an iron-reactive barrier over time. The strong
   fractionation observed may also serve as a tool to distinguish between
   insufficient residence time in the wall and a possible bypassing of the
   wall by the plume, which should result in an unchanged isotopic
   signature of the TCE. Although further work is necessary to apply this
   stable isotope method in the field, it has potential to serve as a
   unique monitoring tool for PRBs based on zero-valent iron. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Backward location and travel time probabilities can be used to determine
   the prior position of contamination in an aquifer. These probabilities,
   which are related to adjoint states of concentration, can be used to
   improve characterization of known sources of groundwater contamination,
   to identify previously unknown contamination sources, and to delineate
   capture zones. The first contribution of this paper is to extend the
   adjoint model to the case of a decaying solute (first-order decay), and
   to describe two different interpretations of backward probabilities. The
   conventional interpretation accounts for the probability that a
   contaminant particle could decay before reaching the detection location.
   The other interpretation is conditioned on the fact that the detected
   contaminant particle actually reached the detection location, despite
   this possibility of decay. In either case, travel time probabilities are
   skewed toward earlier travel times, relative to a conservative solute.
   The second contribution of this paper is to verify the load term for a
   monitoring well observation.
   We provide examples using one-dimensional models and hypothetical
   aquifers. We employ an infinite domain in order to verify the monitoring
   well load. This new but simple one-dimensional adjoint solution can also
   be used to verify higher-dimensional numerical models of backward
   location and travel time probabilities. We employ a semi-infinite domain
   to illustrate the effect of decay on backward models of pumping well
   probabilistic capture zones. Decay causes the capture zones to fall
   closer to the well. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate consumption in aquifers may result from several biogenic and
   abiotic processes such as denitrification, assimilatory NO3- reduction,
   dissimilatory NO3- reduction to ammonium (DNRA), or abiotic NO3- (or
   NO2-) reduction. The objectives of this study were to investigate the
   fate of NO3- in a petroleum-contaminated aquifer, and to assess the
   feasibility of using single-well push-pull tests (PPTs) in combination
   with N-15 isotope and C2H2 inhibition methods for the quantification of
   processes contributing to NOT consumption. Three consecutive PPTs were
   performed in a monitoring well of a heating oil-contaminated aquifer in
   Erlen, Switzerland. For each test, we injected 500 1 of test solution
   containing 0.5 mM Br- as conservative tracer and either 0.5 mM unlabeled
   NO3- or similar to 0.3 mM N-15-labeled NO3- as reactant. Test solutions
   were sparged during preparation and injection with either N-2, At or
   10\% C2H2 in Ar. After an initial incubation period of 1.5-3.2 h, we
   extracted the test solution/groundwater mixtures from the same location
   and measured concentrations of relevant species including Br-, NO3-,
   NO2-, N2O, N-2, and NH4+. In addition, we determined the N-15 contents
   of N-2, N2O, NH4+, and suspended biomass from N-15/N-14 isotope-ratio
   measurements. Average total test duration was 50.5 h. First-order rate
   coefficients (k) were computed from measured NO3- consumption, N-2-N-15
   production and N2O-N-15 production. From measured NO3- consumption we
   obtained nearly identical estimates of k for all PPTs with small 95\%
   confidence intervals, indicating good reproducibility and accuracy for
   the tests. Estimates of k from N-2-N-15 production and N2O-N-15
   production indicated that denitrification accounted for only 46-49\% of
   observed NO3- consumption. Production of N-2-N-15 in the presence Of
   C2H2 was observed during one of the tests, which may be an indicator for
   abiotic NO3- reduction. Moreover, N-15 isotope analyses confirmed
   occurrence of assimilatory NO3- reduction (0.58 at.\% N-15 in suspended
   biomass) and to a smaller extent DNRA (up to 4 at.\% N-15 in NH4+). Our
   results indicated that the combination of PPTs, N-15-isotope and C2H2
   inhibition methods provided improved information on denitrification as
   well as alternative fates of NO3- in this aquifer. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Permeable in situ denitrifying barriers can remove nitrate from
   groundwater. Barriers may be constructed by filling an excavated area
   with a porous mixture of sand, fine gravel, and substrate or by the
   injection of a nonaqueous phase substrate into an aquifer. The substrate
   stimulates the development of a denitrifying microbial community by
   providing an electron donor. The objective of this study was to
   determine the ability of denitrifying barriers to function under
   low-phosphate conditions. Sand columns injected with a soybean oil
   emulsion were used as laboratory models of denitrifying barriers. When a
   natural groundwater containing 17 mg l(-1) nitrate-N and 0.009 mg l(-1)
   phosphate-P was pumped through the columns, only a small amount of
   nitrate was removed from the water and, in some effluent fractions, 52\%
   to 88\% of the influent nitrate had converted to nitrite. Nitrite also
   accumulated when the phosphate concentration of the groundwater was
   increased to 0.040 or 0.080 mg l(-1) phosphate-P. Only when a 0.160 mg
   l(-1) phosphate-P supplement was added to the groundwater was there a
   loss of nitrate without a large accumulation of nitrite. The addition of
   solid calcium phosphate or rock phosphate to the sand columns was found
   to provide adequate phosphate for denitrification in short-term studies.
   These studies point out the need to ensure that adequate phosphate is
   present in denitrifying barriers especially when such barriers are used
   beneath phosphate-binding soils. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Predictions of natural attenuation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
   in the unsaturated zone rely critically on information about microbial
   biodegradation kinetics. This study aims at determining kinetic rate
   laws for the aerobic biodegradation of a mixture of 12 volatile
   petroleum hydrocarbons and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in unsaturated
   alluvial sand. Laboratory column and batch experiments were performed at
   room temperature under aerobic conditions, and a reactive transport
   model for VOC vapors in soil gas coupled to Monod-type degradation
   kinetics was used for data interpretation. In the column experiment, an
   acclimatization of 23 days took place before steady-state diffusive
   vapor transport through the horizontal column was achieved. Monod
   kinetic parameters K-s and nu(max) could be derived from the
   concentration profiles of toluene, m-xylene, n-octane, and n-hexane,
   because substrate saturation was approached with these compounds under
   the experimental conditions. The removal of cyclic alkanes, isooctane,
   and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene followed first-order kinetics over the whole
   concentration range applied. MTBE, n-pentane, and chlorofluorocarbons
   (CFCs) were not visibly degraded. Batch experiments suggested
   first-order disappearance rate laws for all VOCs except n-octane, which
   decreased following zero-order kinetics in live batch experiments. For
   many compounds including MTBE, disappearance rates in abiotic batch
   experiments were as high as in live batches indicating sorption. It was
   concluded that the column approach is preferable for determining
   biodegradation rate parameters to be used in risk assessment models. (C)

Abstract = {{A natural gradient emplaced-source (ES) controlled field experiment was
   conducted at the Borden aquifer research site, Ontario, to study the
   transport of dissolved plumes emanating from residual dense
   nonaqueous-phase liquid (DNAPL) source zones. The specific objective of
   the work presented here is to determine the effects of solute and
   co-solute concentrations on sorption and retardation of dissolved
   chlorinated solvent-contaminant plumes. The ES field experiment
   comprised a controlled emplacement of a residual multicomponent DNAPL
   below the groundwater table and intensive monitoring of dissolved-phase
   plumes of trichloromethane (TCM), trichloroethylene (TCE), and
   perchloroethylene (PCE) plumes continuously generated in the aquifer
   down gradient from gradual source dissolution. Estimates of plume
   retardation (and dispersion) were obtained from 3-D numerical
   simulations that incorporated transient source input and flow regimes
   monitored during the test. PCE, the most retarded solute, surprisingly
   exhibited a retardation factor similar to 3 times lower than observed in
   a previous Borden tracer test by Mackay et al. {[}Water Resour. Res. 22
   (1986) 2017] conducted similar to 150 in away. Also, an absence of
   temporal trend in PCE retardation contrasted with the previous Borden
   test. Supporting laboratory studies on ES site core indicated that
   sorption was nonlinear and competitive, i.e. reduced sorption of PCE was
   observed in the presence of TCE. Consideration of the effects of
   relatively high co-solute (TCE) concentration (competitive sorption) in
   addition to PCE concentration effects (nonlinear sorption) was necessary
   to yield laboratoty-based PCE retardation estimates consistent with the
   field plume values. Concentration- and co-solute-based sorption and
   retardation analysis was also applied to the previous low-concentration
   pulse injection test of Mackay et al. {[}Water Resour. Res. 22 (1986)
   2017] and was able to successfully predict the temporal field
   retardation trends observed in that test. While it is acknowledged that
   other ``nonideal transport{''} effects may contribute, our analysis
   predicts differences in the PCE retardation magnitude and trend between
   the two experiments that are consistent with field observations based on
   the marked solute concentration differences that resulted from
   contrasting source conditions. Solute and co-solute concentration
   effects have heretofore received little attention, but may have wide
   significance in aquifers contaminated by point-source pollutants because
   many plumes contain mixed solutes over wide concentration ranges in
   strata that are likely subject to nonlinear sorption. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To examine colloid transport in geochemically heterogeneous porous media
   at a scale comparable to field experiments, we monitored the migration
   of silica-coated zirconia colloids in a two-dimensional layered porous
   media containing sand coated to three different extents by ferric
   oxyhydroxides. Transport of the colloids was measured over 1.65 m and 95
   days. Colloid transport was modeled by an
   advection-dispersion-deposition equation incorporating geochemical
   heterogeneity and colloid deposition dynamics (blocking). Geochemical
   heterogeneity was represented as favorable (ferric oxyhydroxide-coated)
   and unfavorable (uncoated sand) deposition surface areas. Blocking was
   modeled as random sequential adsorption (RSA). Release of deposited
   colloids was negligible. The time to colloid breakthrough after the
   onset of blocking increased with increasing ferric oxyhydroxide-coated
   surface area. As the ferric oxyhydroxide surface area increased, the
   concentration of colloids in the breakthrough decreased. Model-fits to
   the experimental data were made by inverse solutions to determine the
   fraction of surface area favorable for deposition and the deposition
   rate coefficients for the favorable (ferric oxyhydroxide-coated) and
   unfavorable sites. The favorable deposition rate coefficient was also
   calculated by colloid filtration theory. The model described the time to
   colloid breakthrough and the blocking effect reasonably well and
   estimated the favorable surface area fraction very well for the two
   layers with more than 1\% ferric oxyhydroxide coating. If mica edges in
   the uncoated sand were considered as favorable surface area in addition
   to the ferric oxyhydroxide coatings, the model predicted the favorable
   surface area fraction accurately for the layer with less than 1\% ferric
   oxyhydroxide coating. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The successful dechlorination of mixtures of chlorinated hydrocarbons
   with zero-valent metals requires information concerning the kinetics of
   simultaneous degradation of different contaminants. This includes
   intraspecies competitive effects (loading of the reactive iron surface
   by a single contaminant) as well as interspecies competition of several
   contaminants for the reactive sites available. In columns packed with
   zero-valent iron, the degradation behaviour of trichloroethylene (TCE),
   cis-dichloroethylene (DCE) and mixtures of both was measured in order to
   investigate interspecies competition. Although a decreasing rate of
   dechlorination is to be expected, when several degradable substances
   compete for the reactive sites on the iron surface, TCE degradation is
   nearly unaffected by the presence of cis-DCE. In contrast, cis-DCE
   degradation rates decrease significantly when TCE is added. A new
   modelling approach is developed in order to identify and quantify the
   observed competitive effects. The numerical model TBC (Transport,
   Biochemistry and Chemistry, Schafer et al., 1998a) is used to describe
   adsorption, desorption and dechlorination in a mechanistic way.
   Adsorption and degradation of a contaminant based on a limited number of
   reactive sites leads to a combined zero- and first-order degradation
   kinetics for high and low concentrations, respectively. The adsorption
   of several contaminants with different sorption parameters to a limited
   reactive surface causes interspecies competition. The reaction scheme
   and the parameters required are successfully transferred from Arnold and
   Roberts (2000b) to the model TBC. The degradation behaviour of the mixed
   contamination observed in the column experiments can be related to the
   adsorption properties of TCE and cis-DCE. By predicting the degradation
   of the single substances TCE and cis-DCE as well as mixtures of both,
   the calibrated model is used to investigate the effects of interspecies
   competition on the design of permeable reactive iron barriers. Even if
   TCE is present in only small concentrations (>3\% of molar cis-DCE
   concentration) it is the contaminant limiting the residence time and the
   required thickness of the iron barrier. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V

Abstract = {{Identifying zones of sulphide oxidation and carbonate buffering is
   important in the development of a management plan for mine waste-rock
   piles. In this study, we used a kinetic cell technique to measure rates
   of O-2 consumption and CO2 production in low sulphide (<0.12 wt.\% S),
   low inorganic carbon (<0.20 wt.\% C-inorganic), gneissic waste rock and
   associated organic-rich lake sediment (0.7 wt.\% C-organic) and forest
   soil (1.4 wt.\% C-organic) collected from the Key Lake uranium mine in
   Saskatchewan, Canada. Solid chemistry, stable carbon isotope, pore water
   sulphate concentration data, and stoichiometric considerations indicated
   that O-2 consumption and CO2 production were constrained by microbial
   respiration in the lake sediment and forest soil and by pyrite
   oxidation-carbonate buffering in the gneissic waste rock. Mean ratios of
   molar CO2 production to O-2 consumption rates were 0.5 for lake
   sediment, 0.7 for forest soil, and 0.2 for gneissic waste rock. The
   different O-2/CO2 ratios suggested that O-2-CO2 monitoring may provide a
   practical tool for identifying the zones of microbial respiration and
   pyrite oxidation-carbonate buffering in mine waste-rock piles. Rates of
   O-2 consumption and CO2 production were about one order of magnitude
   greater in lake sediment than in gneissic waste rock, indicating that
   microbial respiration would exert a control on the distribution of O-2
   and CO2 gas in waste-rock piles constructed upon the dewatered lake
   sediments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments to estimate the effective molecular diffusion
   coefficient (D-e) and sorption coefficient (K-d) for volatile organic
   compounds through natural clayey soils were conducted using diffusion
   testing apparatus. The compounds tested were methyl ethyl ketone (MEK),
   toluene and trichloroethylene (TCE). The D-e and K-d values were
   determined by a curve fitting procedure. The compound losses, and the
   effects of porous disks used in the apparatus were significant. The
   transport of MEK was faster than that of TCE and toluene because of the
   lower sorption to the soils. The D-e values of all the compounds were of
   the order of 10(-10) m(2)/s and smaller than the diffusion coefficient
   in pure aqueous solution at infinite dilution (D-o), due to the
   tortuosity of the samples. The effects of the sample thickness on the
   parameter determination were not significant. Comparison to the K-d
   values estimated from batch sorption tests and from organic carbon
   content (finfinity)-based predictions showed that the diffusion test
   results were intermediate between those from the other two methods. The
   diffusion tests use compacted soil samples and should be more relevant
   to in situ conditions, but the reliability of the tests is affected by
   large compound losses that cause uncertainties in their interpretation.
   It is recommended that more than one method be used to assess K-d
   values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The biogeochemical processes were identified which improved the leachate
   composition in the flow direction of a landfill leachate plume
   (Banisveld, The Netherlands). Groundwater observation wells were placed
   at specific locations after delineating the leachate plume using
   geophysical tests to map subsurface conductivity. Redox processes were
   determined using the distribution of solid and soluble redox species,
   hydrogen concentrations, concentration of dissolved gases (N-2, Ar, and
   CH4), and stable isotopes (delta(15)N-NO3, delta(34)S-SO4,
   delta(13)C-CH4, delta(2)H-CH4, and delta(13)C of dissolved organic and
   inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively)). The combined application
   of these techniques improved the redox interpretation considerably.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) decreased downstream in association with
   increasing delta(13)C-DOC values confirming the occurrence of
   degradation. Degradation of DOC was coupled to iron reduction inside the
   plume, while denitrification could be an important redox process at the
   top fringe of the plume. stable carbon and hydrogen isotope signatures
   of methane indicated that methane was formed inside the landfill and not
   in the plume. Total gas pressure exceeded hydrostatic pressure in the
   plume, and methane seems subject to degassing. Quantitative proof for
   DOC degradation under iron-reducing conditions could only be obtained if
   the geochemical processes cation exchange and precipitation of carbonate
   minerals (siderite and calcite) were considered and incorporated in an
   inverse geochemical model of the plume. Simulation of delta(13)C-DIC

Abstract = {{Demonstration of natural attenuation of xenobiotic organic compounds
   (XOCs) in landfill leachate plumes is a difficult task and still an
   emerging discipline within groundwater remediation. One of the early
   studies was made at the Vejen Landfill in Denmark in the late 1980s,
   which suggested that natural attenuation of XOCs took place under
   strongly anaerobic conditions within the first 150 m of the leachate
   plume. This paper reports on a revisit to the same plume 10 years later.
   Within the strongly anaerobic part of the plume, 49 groundwater samples
   were characterized with respect to redox-sensitive species and XOCs. The
   analytical procedures have been developed further and more compounds and
   lower detection limits were observed this time. In addition, the samples
   were screened for degradation intermediates and for toxicity. The plume
   showed fairly stationary features over the 10-year period except that
   the XOC level as well as the level of chloride and nonvolatile organic
   carbon (NVOC) in the plume had decreased somewhat. Most of the compounds
   studied were subject to degradation in addition to dilution. Exceptions
   were benzene, the herbicide Mecoprop (MCPP), and NVOC. In the early
   study, NVOC seemed to degrade in the first part of the plume, but this
   was no longer the case. Benzyl succinic acid (BSA) was for the first
   time identified in a leachate plume as a direct indicator, and as the
   only intermediate of toluene degradation. Toxicity measurements on solid
   phase-extracted (SPE) samples revealed that toxic compounds not
   analytically identified were still present in the plume, suggesting that
   toxicity measurements could be helpful in assessing natural attenuation
   in leachate plumes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the modeling of the hydrogeochemical effects of
   deep well recharge of oxic water into an anoxic pyrite-bearing aquifer.
   Kinetic expressions have been used for mineral dissolution -
   precipitation,rates and organic matter oxidation. Hydrological and
   chemical parameters of the model were calibrated to field measurements.
   The results showed that oxidation of pyrite (FeS2) and, to a lesser
   extent, organic matter dominate the changes in quality of the recharged
   water during its passage through the aquifer. The recharge leads to the
   consumption of oxygen and nitrate and the formation of sulfate and
   ferrihydrite. Complexation reactions, cation exchange and precipitation
   and dissolution of calcite, siderite and rhodochrosite were also
   identified through the modeling. Despite problems of non-uniqueness of
   the calibrated parameters, the model was used successfully to depict the
   geochemical processes occurring in the aquifer. Non-uniqueness can be
   avoided by constraining the model as much as possible to measurements
   and/or data from literature, although they cannot be considered always
   as fixed values and should be considered as stochastic variables
   instead, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Clusters of industrial plants often generate contaminant plumes with
   several potential sources. Prevention of further pollution and designing
   suitable remedial measures require identification of the contributing
   source among all potential ones and the sorting of currently active
   sources from historical ones. in the study area, an industrial complex
   in the Negev desert, Israel, contaminants could not serve as indicators
   for the contamination sources because of their extensive spatial
   distribution across the site. However, stable isotopes of oxygen,
   hydrogen and sulfur, as well as tritium, proved to be efficient tools
   for this task.
   The isotopic characterization of the potential end members provided the
   criteria for constraining a contaminating source when several
   alternative sources appeared viable. The isotopic fractionation of
   oxygen and hydrogen isotopes could be tied to the various disposal
   phases of the industrial wastewater. The three case studies presented
   here confirm the important role of isotopes as tracers in contaminated
   sites. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes an integrated approach for modeling flow and
   contaminant transport in hydraulically connected stream-aquifer systems.
   The code, FTSTREAM, extended the capabilities of the ground-water model,
   FTWORK, to incorporate chemical fate and transport in streams. Flow in
   the stream network is modeled as an unsteady, spatially varying flow,
   while transport modeling is based on a one-dimensional
   advection-dispersion equation. In addition to sorption and decay during
   transport in ground water, the model incorporates volatilization,
   settling and decay during transport in surface water. The interaction
   between surface water and ground water is accommodated by a leakage term
   and is implemented in the model using an iterative Picard-type procedure
   to ensure mass conservation across the interface between the two
   systems.
   The modeling approach is used to simulate contaminant transport in the
   Mad River, Ohio, which is hydraulically connected to a buried valley
   aquifer of sand and gravel outwash. The river is a receiving stream in
   the upstream part of the modeled area. Downstream, heavy pumping from a
   municipal well field causes the river to become a loosing stream.
   Induced infiltration from the river is responsible for a considerable
   portion of the well yield. The flow and transport model, developed for
   this study, simulates coupling between flow in the aquifer and the
   river. Hypothetical sources of contamination are introduced at selected
   locations in the upstream portion of the aquifer. The model is then used
   to simulate the expected transport in both the aquifer and the stream. A
   series of simulations elucidates the role of the river in facilitating
   the transport of the hypothetical contaminants in ground water and
   surface water. Effect of sorption, retardation and volatilization on
   contaminant transport is also examined for the case of the volatile
   organic compounds. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Macrodispersion coefficients are derived for heterogeneous porous media
   under ergodic and nonergodic conditions. Influences of the
   log-conductivity autocovariance function on macro-dispersion are
   investigated through six commonly used isotropic log-conductivity
   autocorrelation models. They are the exponential, Gaussian, spherical,
   linear, Whittle and Mizell A-type models. Analytical expressions for
   ergodic macrodispersion coefficients for each of these models are
   presented. The results for nonergodic macrodispersion coefficients are
   calculated numerically. The results show that the various autocovariance
   functions, which display slight differences in the preasympototic
   region, have little effect on the ultimate macrodispersion coefficient.
   The effect of nonergodicity is more significant than the
   log-conductivity autocovariance function for the aquifers exhibiting
   unimodal log-conductivity distribution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that dechlorinating bacteria can accelerate
   the dissolution rate of dense, nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs)
   containing tetrachloroethene (PCE). We present an
   advection-dispersion-reaction model for a two-dimensional domain, with
   groundwater flowing over a pool of free-product PCE. PCE is converted to
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) and toxicity due to PCE or cDCE is
   neglected. We adopt previously published correlations relating biomass
   concentrations and hydraulic conductivity, accounting for biofilm growth
   and plug-like growth. The system of coupled equations is solved
   numerically. The high biotransformation rate of PCE increases the
   concentration gradient of PCE at the water-DNAPL interface, enhancing
   dissolution. The higher the electron donor (ED) concentration, the
   larger the dissolution enhancement. Based on the values of maximum
   specific rate we used, when the electron donor is unlimited, the active
   biomass accumulates adjacent to the water-NAPL interface and microbial
   reactions can significantly enhance the pool dissolution. The resulting
   steady-state dissolution rate can be approximated by a half-order
   solution when zero-order kinetics are suitable for representing the
   microbial reaction. However, bioclogging may significantly reduce local
   hydraulic conductivity; thus, it decreases the flow near the water-DNAPL
   interface, decreasing dissolution. When the ED is the limiting factor,
   active biomass accumulates away from the interface. This creates a
   no-flow zone between the active biomass and the interface. The
   enlargement of the no-flow zone, due to the donor limitation, diminishes
   the concentration gradient and the flushing around the water-DNAPL
   interface. Such adverse impacts may significantly decrease the
   enhancement predicted by models that do not consider the effects of
   bioclogging. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an approach for characterizing in Situ microbial degradation
   using the (13)C/(12)C isotope fractionation of contaminants as an
   indicator of biodegradation. The (13)C/(12)C isotope fractionation of
   aromatic hydrocarbons was studied in anoxic laboratory soil percolation
   columns with toluene or o-xylene as the sole carbon and electron source,
   and sulfate as electron acceptor. After approximately 2 months' of
   incubation, the soil microbial community degraded 32 mg toluene l(-1)
   and 44 mg o-xylene l(-1) to less than 0.05 mg l(-1), generating a stable
   concentration gradient in the column. The (13)C/(12)C isotope ratio in
   the residual non-degraded fraction of toluene and o-xylene increased
   significantly, corresponding to isotope fractionation factors (alphaC)
   of 1.0015 and 1.0011, respectively. When the extent of biodegradation in
   the soil column was calculated based on the measured isotope ratios
   (R(t)) and an isotope fractionation factor (alphaC = 1.0017) obtained
   from a sulfate-reducing batch culture the theoretical residual substrate
   concentrations (C(t)) matched the measured toluene concentrations in the
   column. This indicated that a calculation of biodegradation based on
   isotope fractionation could work in systems like soil columns.
   In a field study, a polluted, anoxic aquifer was analyzed for BTEX and
   PAH contaminants. These compounds were found to exhibit a significant
   concentration gradient along an 800-m groundwater flow path downstream
   of the source of contamination. A distinct increase in the carbon
   isotope ratio (delta(13)C) was observed for the residual non-degraded
   toluene (7.2parts per thousand), o-xylene (8.1parts per thousand) and
   naphthalene fractions (1.2 parts per thousand). Based on the isotope
   values and the laboratory-derived isotope fractionation factors for
   toluene and o-xylene, the extent to which the residual substrate
   fraction in the monitoring wells had been degraded by microorganisms was
   calculated. The results revealed significant biodegradation along the
   groundwater flow path. In the wells at the end of the plume, the
   bioavailable toluene and o-xylene fractions had been almost completely
   reduced by in situ microbial degradation.
   Although indane and indene showed decreasing concentrations downstream
   of the groundwater flow path, suggesting microbial degradation, their
   carbon isotope ratios remained constant. As the physical properties of
   these compounds are similar to those of BTEX compounds, the constant
   isotope values of indane and indene indicated that microbial degradation
   did not lead to isotope fractionation of all aromatic hydrocarbons. In
   addition, physical interaction with the aquifer material during the
   groundwater passage did not significantly alter the carbon isotope
   composition of aromatic hydrocarbons. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The effect of nitrate on the reduction of TCE by commercial granular
   iron was investigated in column experiments designed to allow for the in
   situ monitoring of the iron surface film with Raman spectroscopy. Three
   column experiments were conducted; one with an influent solution of 100
   mg/l nitrate+ 1.5 mg/l TCE, and two control columns, one saturated
   directly with 100 mg/l nitrate solution, the other pre-treated with
   Millipore water prior to the introduction of a 100 mg/l nitrate
   solution. In the presence of nitrate, TCE adsorbed onto the iron, but
   there was little TCE reduction to end-products ethene and ethane. The
   iron used (Connelly, GPM, Chicago) is a product typical of those used in
   permeable granular iron walls. The material is covered by an air-formed
   high-temperature oxidation film, consisting of an inner layer of Fe3O4,
   and an outer, passive layer of Fe2O3. In the control column pre-treated
   with Millipore water, the passive Fe2O3 layer was removed upon contact
   with the water in a manner consistent with an autoreduction reaction. In
   the TCE+nitrate column and the direct nitrate saturation column, nitrate
   interfered with the removal of the passive layer and maintained
   conditions such that high valency protective corrosion species,
   including Fe2O3 and FeOOH, were stable at the iron surface. The lack of
   TCE reduction is explained by the presence of these species, as they
   inhibit both mechanisms proposed for TCE reduction by iron, including
   catalytic hydrogenation, and direct electron transfer. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A vertically averaged two-dimensional model was developed to describe
   areal spreading and migration of light nonaqueous-phase liquids (LNAPLs)
   introduced into the subsurface by spills or leaks from underground
   storage tanks. The NAPL transport model was coupled with two-dimensional
   contaminant transport models to predict contamination of soil gas and
   groundwater resulting from a LNAPL migrating on the water table.
   Numerical solutions were obtained by using the finite-difference method.
   Simulations and sensitivity analyses were conducted with a LNAPL of pure
   benzene to study LNAPL migration and groundwater contamination. The
   model was applied to subsurface contamination by jet fuel. Results
   indicated that LNAPL migration were affected mostly by volatilization.
   The generation and movement of the dissolved plume was affected by the
   geology of the site and the free-product plume. Most of the spilled mass
   remained as a free LNAPL phase 20 years after the spill. The migration
   of LNAPL for such a long period resulted in the contamination of both
   groundwater and a large volume of soil. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper describes one of the first well-documented field examples of
   natural attenuation of trichloroethylene (TCE) in groundwater in a
   fractured shale bedrock. The study was carried out adjacent to a former
   waste burial site in Waste Area Grouping 5 (WAG5) on the Oak Ridge
   Reservation, Oak Ridge, TN. A contaminant plume containing TCE and its
   daughter products were detected downgradient from the buried waste pits,
   with most of the contamination occurring in the upper 6 in of the
   bedrock. The monitoring well array consists of a 35-m-long transect of
   multilevel sampling wells, situated along a line between the waste pits
   and a seep which discharges into a small stream. Concentrations of
   volatile organic carbons (VOCs) were highest in the waste trenches and
   decreased with distance downgradient towards the seep. Sampling wells
   indicated the presence of overlapping plumes of TCE,
   cis-dichloroethylene (cDCE), vinyl chloride (VC), ethylene, ethane, and
   methane, with the daughter products extending further downgradient than
   the parent (TCE). This type of distribution suggests anaerobic
   biodegradation. Measurements of redox potential at the site indicated
   that iron-reduction, sulfate reduction, and potentially methanogensis
   were occurring and are conducive to dechlorination of TCE. Bacteria
   enrichment of groundwater samples revealed the presence of
   methanotrophs, methanogens, iron-reducing bacteria and sulfate-reducing
   bacteria, all of which have previously been implicated in anaerobic
   biodegradation of TCE. 16S rDNA sequence from DNA extracted from two
   wells were similar to sequences of organisms previously implicated in
   the anaerobic biodegradation of chlorinated solvents. The combined data
   strongly suggest that anaerobic biodegradation of the highly chlorinated
   compounds is occurring. Aerobic biodegradation may also be occurring in
   oxygenated zones, including near a seep where groundwater exits the
   site, or in the upper bedrock during seasonal fluctuations in water
   table elevation and oxygen levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All

Abstract = {{Packed bed laboratory column experiments were performed to simulate the
   biogeochemical processes resulting from microbially catalyzed oxidation
   of organic matter. These included aerobic respiration, denitrification,
   and Mn(IV), Fe(111) and SO4 reduction processes. The effects of these
   reactions on the aqueous- and solid-phase geochemistry of the aquifer
   material were closely examined. The data were used to model the
   development of alkalinity and pH along the column. To study the
   independent development of Fe(Ill)- and SO4-reducing environments, two
   columns were used. One of the columns (column 1) contained small enough
   concentrations Of SO4 in the influent to render the reduction of this
   species unimportant to the geochemical processes in the column.
   The rate of microbially catalyzed reduction of Mn(IV) changed with time
   as evidenced by the variations in the initial rate of Mn(II) production
   at the head of the column. The concentration of Mn in both columns was
   controlled by the solubility of rhodochrosite (MnCO3(S)).
   In the column where significant SO4 reduction took place (column 2), the
   concentration of dissolved Fe(H) was controlled by the solubility of
   FeS. In column 1, where SO4 reduction was not important, maximum
   dissolved Fe(H) concentrations were controlled by the solubility of
   siderite (FeCO3(S)). Comparison of solid-phase and aqueous-phase data
   suggests that nearly 20\% of the produced Fe(H) precipitates as siderite
   in column 1. The solid-phase analysis also indicates that during the
   course of experiment, approximately 20\% of the total Fe(III) hydroxides
   and more than 70\% of the amorphous Fe(III) hydroxides were reduced by
   dissimilatory iron reduction.
   The most important sink for dissolved S(41) produced by the enzymatic
   reduction Of SO4 was its direct reaction with solid-phase Fe(III)
   hydroxides leading initially to the formation of FeS. Compared to this
   pathway, precipitation as FeS did not constitute an important sink for
   S(-II) in column 2. In this column, the total reacted S(-II) estimated
   from the concentration of dissolved sulfur species was in good agreement
   with the produced Cr(II)-reducible sulfur in the solid phase.
   Solid-phase analysis of the sulfur species indicated that up to half of
   the originally produced FeS may have possibly transformed to FeS2. (C)

Abstract = {{Tracer tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of a complexing sugar
   flush (CSF) on in-situ biodegradation potential at a site contaminated
   by jet fuel, solvents, and other organic compounds. Technical-grade
   hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was used during the CSF study, which was
   conducted in a hydraulically isolated cell emplaced in a surficial
   aquifer. In-situ biodegradation potential was assessed with the use of
   tracer tests, which were conducted prior to and immediately following
   the CSF study. Ethanol, hexanol, and benzoate were used as the
   biodegradable tracers, while bromide was used as a nonreactive tracer.
   The results indicate that the biodegradation of benzoate was similar for
   both tracer tests. Conversely, the biodegradation of ethanol (23\%
   increase) and hexanol (41\% increase) was greater for the post-CSF
   tracer test. In addition, analysis of core samples collected from within
   the test cell indicates that the population density of aerobic jet-fuel
   degraders increased in the vicinity of the injection wells during the
   CSF. These results indicate that the cyclodextrin flush did not
   deleteriously affect the indigenous microbial community. This study
   illustrates that tracer tests can be used to evaluate the impact of
   remediation activities on in-situ biodegradation potential. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Contaminant breakthrough behavior in a variety of heterogeneous porous
   media was measured in laboratory experiments, and evaluated in terms of
   both the classical advection-dispersion equation (ADE) and the
   continuous time random walk (CTRW) framework. Heterogeneity can give
   rise to non-Fickian transport patterns, which are distinguished by
   ``anomalous{''} early arrival and late time tails in breakthrough
   curves. Experiments were conducted in two mid-scale laboratory flow
   cells packed with clean, sieved sand of specified grain sizes. Three
   sets of experiments were performed, using a ``homogeneous{''} packing, a
   randomly heterogeneous packing using sand of two grain sizes, and an
   exponentially correlated structure using sand of three grain sizes.
   Concentrations of sodium chloride tracer were monitored at the inflow
   reservoir and measured at the outflow reservoir. Breakthrough curves
   were then analyzed by comparison to fitted solutions from the ADE and
   CTRW formulations. In all three systems, including the ``homogeneous{''}
   one, subtle yet measurable differences between Fickian and non-Fickian
   transport were observed. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the
   CTRW theory characterized the full shape of the breakthrough curves far
   more effectively than the ADE. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The ability of a multiphase flow model to capture the migration behavior
   of chlorinated solvents under conditions of surfactant-facilitated
   interfacial tension (IFT) reduction is assessed through comparison of
   model predictions with observations from controlled laboratory
   experiments. Tetrachloroethene (PCE) was released in two-dimensional
   saturated systems, packed with sandy media that incorporated rectangular
   lenses of capillary contrast. Spatially uniform interfacial tension
   conditions were created in the tanks by pre-flushing the porous medium
   with either Milli Q water or an aqueous surfactant solution.
   Experimental observations showed that surfactant-facilitated IFT
   reductions substantially lowered capillary resistance to the vertical
   downward migration of PCE and enabled PCE to enter finer grained, less
   permeable lenses that were not penetrated in the absence of surfactant.
   An immiscible flow model was used to simulate the conditions of the
   laboratory experiments. Under higher IFT conditions (47.5 and 5 dyn/cm),
   the model could successfully predict the general migration behavior of
   the organic liquid. Model predictions, however, exhibited poorer
   agreement with observed migration pathways under low IFT conditions (0.5
   dyn/cm). In all cases, the predicted PCE distributions were influenced
   by selection of the parametric model for capillary retention and
   relative permeability. Simulated migration rates were more consistent
   with observed behavior when the Brooks-Corey/Burdine model was employed.
   For low interfacial tensions, improved predictions of migration pathways
   were obtained through grid refinement and incorporation of small-scale
   packing variability. Simulations highlight the substantial sensitivity
   of model predictions to the capillary pressure-scaling factor, grid
   resolution, and small-scale porosity variations at interfaces of
   permeability contrast under reduced IFT conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Natural attenuation of the chiral pesticide mecoprop
   {[}2-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid] has been studied by
   determining changes in its enantiomeric fraction in different redox
   environments down gradient of a landfill in the Lincolnshire Limestone.
   Previous studies have shown that mecoprop degrades predominantly
   aerobically and that differences in the biological behaviour of the two
   enantionners will change their relative proportions during
   biodegradation.
   Originally deposited as a racemic mixture, there has been no change in
   the enantiomeric fraction in the most polluted part of the landfill
   plume where conditions are sulphate reducing/methanogenic. In the
   nitrate-reducing zone, the proportion of (S)-mecoprop increases,
   suggesting preferential degradation of (R)-mecoprop; while in the
   aerobic zone, the proportion of (R)-mecoprop increases, suggesting
   faster degradation of (S)-mecoprop. Mecoprop persistence in the confined
   Lincolnshire Limestone further downdip is explained by inhibition of
   degradation in sulphate-reducing conditions, which develop naturally.
   Laboratory microcosm experiments using up to 10 mg l(-1) of mecoprop
   confirm these inferences and show that under aerobic conditions,
   (S)-mecoprop and (R)-mecoprop degrade with zero-order kinetics at rates
   of 1.90 and 1.32 mg l(-1) day(-1), respectively. Under nitrate-reducing
   conditions (S)mecoprop does not degrade, but (R)-mecoprop degrades with
   zero-order kinetics at 0.65 mg l(-1) day(-1) to produce a stoichiometric
   equivalent amount of 4-chloro-2-methylphenol. This metabolite only
   degrades when the (R)-mecoprop has disappeared. The addition of nitrate
   to a dormant iron-reducing microcosm devoid of nitrate stimulated
   anaerobic degradation of (R)-mecoprop after a lag period of 21 days.
   There was no evidence for enantiomeric inversion.
   The study demonstrates the sensitivity of changes in enantiomeric
   fraction for detecting natural attenuation, and reveals subtle
   differences in mecoprop degradation in different redox environments
   within the Lincolnshire Limestone aquifer. (C) 2003 Published by

Abstract = {{Stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes can be an efficient means to
   validate biodegradation of organic contaminants in groundwater since it
   results in an isotopic fractionation. A prerequisite in applying this
   method in the field is the proof that other processes decreasing the
   contaminant concentration are conservative with respect to isotope
   effects. In this paper we show for carbon isotopes of halogenated
   hydrocarbon compounds {[}trichloroethene (TCE), cis-dichloroethene
   (c-DCE), vinylchloride (VC)] and carbon and hydrogen isotopes of BTEX
   compounds (benzene, toluene, p-xylene) that no significant fractionation
   occurs during equilibrium sorption onto activated carbon, lignite coke
   and lignite. In general, effects were in the range of the
   reproducibility limit of the analytical instrument (0.5 parts per
   thousand for delta(13)C, and 8 parts per thousand for delta(2)H). This
   observation was made for fractions sorbed of less than 5\% to more than
   95\%. Also for rate-limited sorption of TCE onto activated carbon, no
   significant fractionation in carbon isotopes could be observed. These
   findings support the assumption that for these classes of compounds,
   sorption processes in aquifer systems are conservative with respect to
   isotope effects. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation of trace metals and radionuclides in groundwater may
   require the manipulation of redox conditions via the injection of a
   carbon source. For example, after nitrate has been reduced, soluble
   U(VI) can be reduced simultaneously with other electron acceptors such
   as Fe(Ill) or sulfate to U(IV), which may precipitate as a solid
   (uraninite).
   To simulate the numerous biogeochemical processes that will occur during
   the bioremediation of trace-metal-contaminated aquifers, a
   time-dependent one-dimensional reactive transport model has been
   developed. The model consists of a set of coupled mass balance
   equations, accounting for advection, hydrodynamic dispersion, and a
   kinetic formulation of the biological or chemical transformations
   affecting an organic substrate, electron acceptors, corresponding
   reduced species, and trace metal contaminants of interest, uranium in
   this study. This set of equations is solved numerically, using a finite
   difference approximation. The redox conditions of the domain are
   characterized by estimating the pE, based on the concentration of the
   dominant terminal electron acceptor and its corresponding reduced
   species. This pE and the concentrations of relevant species are then
   used by a modified version of MINTEQA2, which calculates the
   speciation/sorption and precipitation/dissolution of the species of
   interest under equilibrium conditions. Kinetics of
   precipitation/dissolution processes are described as being proportional
   to the difference between the actual and calculated equilibrium
   concentration. A global uncertainty assessment, determined by Random
   Sampling High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR), was performed
   to attain a phenomenological understanding of the origins of output
   variability and to suggest input parameter refinements as well as to
   provide guidance for field experiments to improve the quality of the
   model predictions. By decomposing the model output variance into its
   different input contributions, RS-HDMR can identify the model inputs
   with the most influence on various model outputs, as well as their
   behavior pattern on the model output. Simulations are performed to
   illustrate the effect of biostimulation on the fate of uranium in a
   saturated aquifer, and to identify the key processes that need to be
   characterized with the highest accuracy prior to designing a uranium
   bioremediation scheme. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Although progress has been made toward understanding the surface
   chemistry of granular iron and the mechanisms through which it
   attenuates groundwater contaminants, potential long-term changes in the
   solute transport properties of granular iron media have until now
   received relatively little attention. As part of column investigations
   of alterations in the reactivity of granular iron, studies using
   tritiated water ((H2O)-H-3) as a conservative and non-partitioning
   tracer were periodically conducted to independently isolate
   transport-related effects on performance from those more directly
   related to surface reactivity. Hydraulic residence time distributions
   (HRTDs) within each of six 39-cm columns exposed to bicarbonate
   solutions were obtained over the course of 1100 days of operation. First
   moment analyses of the data revealed generally modest increases in mean
   pore water velocity (v) over time, indicative of decreasing water-filled
   porosity. Gravimetric measurements provided independent estimates of
   water-filled porosity that were initially consistent with those obtained
   from (H2O)-H-3 tracer tests, although at later times, porosities derived
   from gravimetric measurements deviated from the tracer test results
   owing to mineral precipitation. The combination of gravimetric
   measurements and (H2O)-H-3 tracer studies furnished estimates of
   precipitated mineral mass; depending on the assumed identity of the
   predominant mineral phase(s), the porosity decrease associated with
   solute precipitation amounted to 6-24\% of the initial porosity. The
   accumulation of mineral and gas phases led to the formation of regions
   of immobile water and increased spreading of the tracer pulse.
   Application of a dual-region transport model to the (H2O)-H-3
   breakthrough curves revealed that the immobile water-filled region
   increased from initially negligible values to amounts ranging between
   3\% and 14\% of the total porosity in later periods of operation. For
   the aged columns, mobile-immobile mass transfer coefficients (k(mt))
   were generally in the range of 0.1-1.0 day(-1) and reflected a slow
   exchange of (H2O)-H-3 between the two regions. Additional model
   calculations incorporating sorption and reaction suggest that although
   changes in HRTD can have an appreciable effect on trichloroethylene
   (TCE) transformation, the effect is likely to be minor relative to that
   stemming from passivation of the granular iron surface. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Nonideal transport of contaminants in porous media has often been
   observed in laboratory characterization studies. It has long been
   recognized that multiple processes associated with both physical and
   chemical factors can contribute to this nonideal transport behavior. To
   fully understand system behavior, it is important to determine the
   relative contributions of these multiple factors when conducting
   contaminant transport and fate studies. In this study, the relative
   contribution of physical-heterogeneity-related processes versus those of
   nonlinear, rate-limited sorption/desorption to the observed nonideal
   transport of trichloroethene in an undisturbed aquifer core was
   determined through a series of miscible-displacement experiments. The
   results of experiments conducted using the undisturbed core, collected
   from a Superfund site in Tucson, AZ, were compared to those obtained
   from experiments conducted using the same aquifer material packed
   homogeneously. The results indicate that both physical and chemical
   factors, specifically preferential flow and associated rate-limited
   diffusive mass-transfer and rate-limited sorption/desorption,
   respectively, contributed to the nonideal behavior observed for
   trichloroethene transport in the undisturbed core. A successful
   prediction of trichloroethene transport in the undisturbed core was made
   employing a mathematical model incorporating multiple sources of
   nonideal transport, using independently determined model parameters to
   account for the multiple factors contributing to the nonideal transport
   behavior. The simulation results indicate that local-scale physical
   heterogeneity controlled the nonideal transport behavior of
   trichloroethene in the undisturbed core, and that nonlinear,
   rate-limited sorption/desorption were of secondary importance. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Concentrations and isotopic compositions (C-13/C-12) of aromatic
   hydrocarbons were determined in eight samples obtained from the strongly
   anoxic part of the leachate plume downgradient from the Vejen Landfill
   (Denmark), where methanogenic, sulfate-reducing and iron-reducing
   conditions were observed. Despite the heterogeneous distribution of the
   compounds in the plume, the isotope fractionation proved that
   ethylbenzene and m/p-xylene were subject to significant biodegradation
   within the strongly anoxic plume. The isotope fractionation factors
   (alphaC) for the degradation of the m/p-xylene (1.0015) and ethylbenzene
   (1.0021) obtained from the field observations were similar to factors
   previously determined for the anaerobic degradation of toluene and
   o-xylene in laboratory experiments, and suggest that in situ
   biodegradation is one major process controlling the fate of these
   contaminants in this aquifer. The isotope fractionation determined for
   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene and 2-ethyltoluene suggested in situ
   biodegradation; however, the isotopic composition did not correlate well
   with the respective concentration as expressed by the Rayleigh equation.
   Some other compounds (1,2,3-trimethylbenzene, o-xylene, naphthalene and
   fenchone) did not show significant enrichments in delta(13)C values
   along the flow path. The compound concentrations were too low for
   accurate isotope analyses of benzene, toluene, 1- and
   2-methylnaphthalene, while interferences in the chromatography made it
   impossible to evaluate the isotopic composition for 4-ethyltoluene,
   1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and camphor.
   In addition to demonstrating the potential of assessing isotopic
   fractionation as a means for documenting the in situ biodegradation of
   complex mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons in leachate plumes, this study
   also illustrates the difficulties for data interpretation in complex
   plumes and high analytical uncertainties for isotope analysis of organic
   compounds in low concentration ranges. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{A particular problem with the release of dense nonaqueous phase liquids
   (DNAPLs) into the environment is identifying where the DNAPL is and if
   it is still moving. This question is particularly important at sites
   where thousands of cubic meters of DNAPLs were disposed of To date,
   results from laboratory models have not been scaled to predict analogous
   migration at the larger length and time scales appropriate for sites
   where large volumes of DNAPLs were released. Modified inspectional
   analysis is a technique for developing scaling relationships through
   nondimensionalizing the governing equations. It was applied in this
   study to scale observations of DNAPL migration in a laboratory model to
   four hypothetical scenarios in the field where large volumes of DNAPL
   were released. One scenario was compared to a large DNAPL spill site.
   The length and time scales of DNAPL movement predicted from our analysis
   are consistent with those predicted from a numerical model of this site.
   To our knowledge, this is the first application of modified inspectional
   analysis for release of DNAPLs in a laboratory model. This methodology
   may prove useful for scaling results from other laboratory
   investigations of DNAPL migration to field-scale systems. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The formation of residual, discontinuous nonaqueous phase liquids
   (NAPLs) in the vadose zone is a process that is not well understood. To
   obtain data that can be used to study the development of a residual NAPL
   saturation in the vadose zone and to test current corresponding models,
   detailed transient experiments were conducted in intermediate-scale
   columns and flow cell. The column experiments were conducted to
   determine residual carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) saturations of two sands
   and to evaluate the effect of CCl4 vapors on the water distribution. In
   the intermediate-scale flow cell experiment, a rectangular zone of the
   fine-grained sand was packed in an otherwise medium-grained matrix. A
   limited amount of CCl4 was injected from a small source and allowed to
   redistribute until a pseudo steady state situation had developed. A
   dual-energy gamma radiation system was used to determine fluid
   saturations at numerous locations. The experiments clearly demonstrated
   the formation of residual CCl4 saturations in both sands. Simulations
   with an established multifluid flow simulator show the shortcomings of
   current relative permeability-saturation-capillary pressure (k-S-P)
   models. The results indicate that nonspreading behavior of NAPLs should
   be implemented in simulators to account for the formation of residual
   saturations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   parameter addressed in site characterization and flow and transport
   modeling of the potential nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain,
   NV, USA. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has documented hydrogenic
   calcite abundances in fractures and lithophysal cavities at Yucca
   Mountain to provide constraints on percolation fluxes in the UZ. The
   purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   percolation flux and measured calcite abundances using reactive
   transport modeling. Our model considers the following essential factors
   affecting calcite precipitation: (1) infiltration, (2) the ambient
   geothermal gradient, (3) gaseous CO2 diffusive transport and
   partitioning in liquid and gas phases, (4) fracture-matrix interaction
   for water flow and chemical constituents, and (5) water-rock
   interaction. Over a bounding range of 2-20 mm/year infiltration rate,
   the simulated calcite distributions capture the trend in calcite
   abundances measured in a deep borehole (WT-24) by the USGS. The calcite
   is found predominantly in fractures in the welded tuffs, which is also
   captured by the model simulations. Simulations showed that from about 2
   to 6 mm/year, the amount of calcite precipitated in the welded Topopah
   Spring tuff is sensitive to the infiltration rate. This dependence
   decreases at higher infiltration rates owing to a modification of the
   geothermal gradient from the increased percolation flux. The model also
   confirms the conceptual model for higher percolation fluxes in the
   fractures compared to the matrix in the welded units, and the
   significant contribution of Ca from water-rock interaction. This study
   indicates that reactive transport modeling of calcite deposition can
   yield important constraints on the unsaturated zone
   infiltration-percolation flux and provide useful insight into processes
   such as fracture-matrix interaction as well as conditions and parameters
   controlling calcite deposition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The original Henry problem is characterized with severe (albeit
   unphysical) sea boundary condition difficult to handle with numerical
   methods. In this paper, we present an improved numerical solution of the
   Henry problem. Presented numerical model solves the steady-state
   dimensionless equations by the collocation method named Fup Fragment
   Collocation Method (FFCM) and uses R-bf basis functions of Fup(2) (x, y)
   type. This method enables application of the classical formulation and
   high approximation accuracy as proven in comparison with published
   solutions. Particular difficulty in solving the original Henry problem
   is in the accurate representation of the seepage face due to the fixed
   sea concentration at the sea boundary. The results of the original Henry
   problem formulation and problem with modified boundary conditions
   indicate the accuracy and robustness of the FFCM in describing the
   discharge area of the considered problem. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Temperature data from the unsaturated zone (UZ) at Yucca Mountain are
   analyzed to estimate percolation-flux rates and overall heat flux. A
   multilayer, one-dimensional analytical solution is presented for
   determining percolation flux from temperature data. Case studies have
   shown that the analytical solution agrees very well with results from
   the numerical code, TOUGH2. The results of the analysis yield
   percolation fluxes in the range from 0 to 20 mm/year for most of the
   deep boreholes. This range is in good agreement with the results of
   infiltration studies at Yucca Mountain. Percolation flux for the
   shallower boreholes, however, cannot be accurately determined from
   temperature data alone because large gas flow in the shallow system
   alters the temperature profiles. Percolation-flux estimates for
   boreholes located near or intersecting major faults are significantly
   higher than those for other boreholes. These estimates may be affected
   by gas flow in the faults. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights

Abstract = {{We have carried out numerical modeling studies to investigate the
   development of discrete-fracture flow paths and flow-focusing phenomena
   in the unsaturated rock of the potential repository horizon at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada. These studies are based on two- and three-dimensional
   (2-D and 3-D) numerical models using site-specific parameters. The 2-D
   and 3-D models use high-resolution spatial discretization to explicitly
   include effects of discrete fractures with stochastically developed
   fracture permeabilities and a continuum approach. The permeability field
   is generated based on air permeability measurements at various scales.
   For most of the cases considered, uniform infiltration with different
   average rates (1-500 mm/year) is prescribed at the top of the model,
   while variability in outflow at the bottom of the model is used to
   evaluate the degree of flow focusing. In addition, scenarios involving
   nonuniform infiltration at the top boundary, different permeability
   correlation lengths and different flow-allocation schemes were analyzed.
   The modeling results obtained from all of the cases showed a remarkably
   similar flow-focusing pattern at the repository horizon. Furthermore,
   tracer transport simulation results also revealed additional features of
   focused flow and transport through the fracture network. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{An extensive set of chlorine-36 (Cl-36) data has been collected in the
   Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF), an 8-km-long tunnel at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada, for the purpose of developing and testing conceptual
   models of flow and transport in the unsaturated zone (UZ) at this site.
   At several locations, the measured values of Cl-36/Cl ratios for salts
   leached from rock samples are high enough to provide strong evidence
   that at least a small component of bomb-pulse Cl-36, fallout from
   atmospheric testing of nuclear devices in the 1950s and 1960s, was
   measured, implying that some fraction of the water traveled from the
   ground surface through 200-300 m of unsaturated rock to the level of the
   ESF during the last 50 years. These data are analyzed here using a
   formal statistical approach based on log-linear models to evaluate
   alternative conceptual models for the distribution of such fast flow
   paths. The most significant determinant of the presence of bomb-pulse
   Cl-36 in a sample from the welded Topopah Spring unit (TSw) is the
   structural setting from which the sample was collected. Our analysis
   generally supports the conceptual model that a fault that cuts through
   the nonwelded Paintbrush tuff unit (PTn) that overlies the TSw is
   required in order for bomb-pulse Cl-36 to be transmitted to the sample
   depth in less than 50 years. Away from PTn-cutting faults, the ages of
   water samples at the ESF appear to be a strong function of the thickness
   of the nonwelded tuff between the ground surface and the ESF, due to
   slow matrix flow in that unit. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To improve understanding of the physics of dynamic instabilities in
   unsaturated flow processes within the Paintbrush nonwelded unit (PTn)
   and the middle nonlithophysal portion of the Topopah Spring welded tuff
   unit (TSw) of Yucca Mountain, we analyzed data from a series of
   infiltration tests carried out at two sites (Alcove 4 and Alcove 6) in
   the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF), using analytical and empirical
   functions. The analysis of infiltration rates measured at both sites
   showed three temporal scales of infiltration rate: (1) a macro-scale
   trend of overall decreasing flow, (2) a meso-scale trend of fast and
   slow motion exhibiting three-stage variations of the flow rate
   (decreasing, increasing, and {[}again] decreasing flow rate, as observed
   in soils in the presence of entrapped air), and (3) micro-scale (high
   frequency) fluctuations. Infiltration tests in the nonwelded unit at
   Alcove 4 indicate that this unit may effectively dampen episodic fast
   infiltration events; however, well-known Kostyakov, Horton, and Philip
   equations do not satisfactorily describe the observed trends of the
   infiltration rate. Instead, a Weibull distribution model can most
   accurately describe experimentally determined time trends of the
   infiltration rate. Infiltration tests in highly permeable, fractured,
   welded tuff at Alcove 6 indicate that the infiltration rate exhibits
   pulsation, which may have been caused by multiple threshold effects and
   water-air redistribution between fractures and matrix. The empirical
   relationships between the extrinsic seepage from fractures, matrix
   imbibition, and gravity drainage versus the infiltration rate, as well
   as scaling and self-similarity for the leading edge of the water front
   are the hallmark of the nonlinear dynamic processes in water flow under
   episodic infiltration through fractured tuff. Based on the analysis of
   experimental data, we propose a conceptual model of a dynamic fracture
   flow and fracture-matrix interaction in fractured tuff, incorporating
   the time-dependent processes of water redistribution in the
   fracture-matrix system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All fights

Abstract = {{We discuss the development and calibration of a model for predicting
   seepage into underground openings. Seepage is a key factor affecting the
   performance of the potential nuelear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain,
   Nevada. Three-dimensional numerical models were developed to simulate
   field tests in which water was released from boreholes above excavated
   niches. Data from air-injection tests were geostatistically analyzed to
   infer the heterogeneous structure of the fracture permeability field.
   The heterogeneous continuum model was then calibrated against the
   measured amount of water that seeped into the opening. This approach
   resulted in the estimation of model-related, seepage-specific parameters
   on the scale of interest. The ability of the calibrated model to predict
   seepage was examined by comparing calculated with measured seepage rates
   from additional experiments conducted in different portions of the
   fracture network. We conclude that an effective capillary strength
   parameter is suitable to characterize seepage-related features and
   processes for use in a prediction model of average seepage into
   potential waste-emplacement drifts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A wide array of field observations, in situ testing, and rock and water
   sampling (and subsequent analyses) within the unsaturated zone (UZ) of
   Yucca Mountain demonstrate the importance of fractures to flow and
   transport in the welded tuffs. The abundance of fractures and the
   spatial variability in their hydraulic properties, along with the
   heterogeneity within lithologic formations, make evaluation of
   unsaturated processes occurring within the potential repository horizon
   complex. Fracture mapping and field testing show that fractures are well
   connected, yet considerable variation is seen within and between units
   comprising the potential repository horizon with regard to fracture
   trace length, spacing, permeability, and capillarity. These variations
   have important implications for the distribution and movement of water
   and solutes through the unsaturated zone. Numerical models designed to
   assess such phenomena as unsaturated flow, transport, and coupled
   thermal-hydrological processes each require their own conceptual model
   for fracture networks, in order to identify the subset of all fractures
   that is relevant to the particular study. We evaluate several
   process-dependent conceptual models for fractures and identify the
   relevant fracture subsets related to these processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The current concept for high-level radioactive waste disposal at Yucca
   Mountain is for the waste to be placed in underground tunnels (or
   drifts) in the middle of a thick unsaturated zone. Flow modeling and
   field testing have shown that not all flow encountering a drift will
   seep into the drift. The underlying reason for the diversion of
   unsaturated flow around a drift is that capillary forces in the
   fractures and matrix prevent water entry into the drift unless the
   capillary pressure in the rock decreases sufficiently to allow for
   gravity forces to overcome the capillary barrier. As a result of the
   capillary barrier effect, flow tends to be diverted around the drift,
   affecting the flow pattern beneath the drift. For some distance beneath
   the drift, water saturation and flux are reduced. This drift shadow zone
   is much more pronounced in the fractures than in the matrix due to
   dominance of gravity over capillary forces in the fractures. Moving
   downward, away from the drift, the shadow zone asymptotically
   re-equilibrates to the undisturbed flow conditions due to capillary
   forces. The behavior of radionuclide transport in this zone of reduced
   flow is investigated here because this will affect the amount of time
   required for radionuclides to penetrate the unsaturated zone. The delay
   of radionuclide movement in the geosphere is one aspect of the potential
   repository system that could limit public exposure to radioactive waste.
   The behavior of flow and transport is calculated using a
   two-dimensional, drift-scale dual-permeability model extending to nine
   drift diameters below the potential waste emplacement drift. The flow
   model is first compared with an analytical model for a single continuum.
   Then, the dual-continuum flow model is investigated with respect to
   drift-scale and mountain-scale property sets. Transport calculations are
   performed for a wide range of flow conditions and for different aqueous
   radionuclides and colloids. Findings indicate that transport times for
   dissolved or colloidal material released from a drift without seepage
   are several orders of magnitude longer than if the releases occurred in
   the undisturbed flow field. Furthermore, the calculations indicate that
   the transport rate for radionuclides released in the drift shadow is
   relatively insensitive to flow rates in the fractures, but is sensitive
   to the flow rate in the matrix. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Seepage into drifts in unsaturated tuff is an important issue for the
   long-term performance of the proposed nuclear waste repository at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada. Drifts in which waste packages will be emplaced are
   subject to degradation in the form of rockfall from the drift ceiling,
   induced by stress-relief, seismic, or thermal effects. The objective of
   this study is to calculate seepage rates, for various drift-degradation
   scenarios and for different values of percolation flux, in the Topopah
   Spring middle nonlithophysal (Tptpmn) and the Topopah Spring lower
   lithophysal (Tptpll) units at Yucca Mountain. Seepage calculations are
   conducted by (1) defining a heterogeneous drift-scale permeability model
   with field data, (2) selecting calibrated parameters associated with the
   Tptpmn and Tptpll units, and (3) simulating seepage, based on detailed
   degraded-drift profiles obtained from a separate rock mechanics
   engineering analysis. The simulation results indicate (1) that the
   seepage threshold (i.e., the percolation flux at which seepage first
   occurs) is not significantly changed by drift degradation and (2) the
   degradation-induced increase in seepage above the threshold is
   influenced probably more by the shape of the cavity created by rockfall
   than by rockfall volume. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Because the continuum approach is relatively simple and straightforward
   to implement, it has been commonly used in modeling flow and transport
   in unsaturated fractured rock. However, the usefulness of this approach
   can be questioned in terms of its adequacy for representing fingering
   flow and transport in unsaturated fractured rock. The continuum approach
   thus needs to be evaluated carefully by comparing simulation results
   with field observations directly related to unsaturated flow and
   transport processes. This paper reports on such an evaluation, based on
   a combination of model calibration and prediction, using data from an
   infiltration test carried out in a densely fractured rock within the
   unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Comparisons between
   experimental and modeling results show that the continuum approach may
   be able to capture important features of flow and transport processes
   observed from the test. The modeling results also show that matrix
   diffusion may have a significant effect on the overall transport
   behavior in unsaturated fractured rocks, which can be used to estimate
   effective fracture-matrix interface areas based on tracer transport
   data. While more theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies are
   needed to provide a conclusive evaluation, this study suggests that the
   continuum approach is useful for modeling flow and transport in
   unsaturated, densely fractured rock. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This study develops a mathematical model for the analysis of pressure
   behavior in fractured lithophysal reservoirs. The lithophysal rock is
   described as a tri-continuum medium, consisting of fractures, rock
   matrices, and cavities. In the conceptual model, fractures have
   homogeneous properties throughout and interact with rock matrices and
   cavities that have different permeabilities and porosities. Global flow
   occurs through the fracture network only, while rock matrices and
   cavities contain the majority of fluid storage and provide fluid
   drainage to the fractures. Interporosity flows between the triple media
   are described using a pseudosteady-state concept and the system is
   characterized by interporosity transmissivity ratios and storativity
   ratio of each continuum. Pressure behavior is analyzed by examining the
   pressure drawdown curves, the derivative plots, and the effects of the
   characteristic parameters. Typical pressure responses from fractures,
   matrices, and cavities are represented by three semilog straight lines;
   the transitions by two troughs below the stabilization lines in the
   derivative plots. The analytical solution to the proposed model is
   further verified using a numerical simulation. The analytical model has
   also been applied to a published field-buildup well test and is able to
   match the pressure buildup data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In this study, porewater chloride data from Yucca Mountain, NV are
   analyzed and modeled by three-dimensional chemical transport simulation
   and analytical methods. The simulation modeling approach is based on a
   continuum formulation of coupled multiphase fluid flow and tracer
   transport processes through fractured porous rock using a dual-continuum
   concept. Infiltration rate calibrations were performed using the
   porewater chloride data. Model results of chloride distributions were
   improved in matching the observed data with the calibrated infiltration
   rates. Statistical analyses of the frequency distribution for overall
   percolation fluxes and chloride concentration in the unsaturated zone
   system demonstrate that the use of the calibrated infiltration rates had
   an insignificant effect on the distribution of simulated percolation
   fluxes but significantly changed the predicted distribution of simulated
   chloride concentrations. An analytical method was also applied to model
   transient chloride transport. The method was verified by
   three-dimensional simulation results to be capable of capturing major
   chemical transient behavior and trends. Effects of lateral flow in the
   Paintbrush nonwelded unit on percolation fluxes and chloride
   distribution were studied by three-dimensional simulations with
   increased horizontal permeability. The combined results from these model
   calibrations furnish important information for the UZ model studies,
   contributing to performance assessment of the potential repository. (C)

Abstract = {{Low-temperature calcite and opal record the past seepage of water into
   open fractures and lithophysal cavities in the unsaturated zone at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada, site of a proposed high-level radioactive waste
   repository. Systematic measurements of calcite and opal coatings in the
   Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF) tunnel at the proposed repository
   horizon are used to estimate the volume of calcite at each site of
   calcite and/or opal deposition. By estimating the volume of water
   required to precipitate the measured volumes of calcite in the
   unsaturated zone, seepage rates of 0.005 to 5 liters/year (1/year) are
   calculated at the median and 95th percentile of the measured volumes,
   respectively. These seepage rates are at the low end of the range of
   seepage rates from recent performance assessment (PA) calculations,
   confirming the conservative nature of the performance assessment.
   However, the distribution of the calcite and opal coatings indicate that
   a much larger fraction of the potential waste packages would be
   contacted by this seepage than is calculated in the performance
   assessment. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and use of a particle-tracking
   model to perform radionuclide-transport simulations in the unsaturated
   zone at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The goal of the effort was to produce a
   computational model that can be coupled to the project's calibrated 3D
   site-scale flow model so that the results of that effort could be
   incorporated directly into the Total System Performance Assessment
   (TSPA) analyses. The transport model simulates multiple species
   (typically 20 or more) with complex time-varying and spatially varying
   releases from the potential repository. Water-table rise, climate-change
   scenarios, and decay chains are additional features of the model. A
   cell-based particle-tracking method was employed that includes a
   dual-permeability formulation, advection, longitudinal dispersion,
   matrix diffusion, and colloid-facilitated transport. This paper examines
   the transport behavior of several key radionuclides through the
   unsaturated zone using the calibrated 3D unsaturated flow fields.
   Computational results illustrate the relative importance of fracture
   flow, matrix diffusion, and lateral diversion on the distribution of
   travel times from the simulated repository to the water table for
   various climatic conditions. Results also indicate rapid transport
   through fractures for a portion of the released mass. Further refinement
   of the model will address several issues, including conservatism in the
   transport model, the assignment of parameters in the flow and transport
   models, and the underlying assumptions used to support the conceptual
   models of flow and transport in the unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain.

Abstract = {{To investigate the potential for fast flow through altered tuff of the
   nonwelded unit of the Paintbrush Group (PTn) at Yucca Mountain, Nevada,
   we carried out in situ field experiments using water released directly
   into the matrix and along a minor subvertical normal fault at Alcove 4
   in the Exploratory Studies Facility (ESF). During the experiments,
   changes in moisture content were monitored within the test bed, and a
   slot excavated below the test bed was visually inspected for seepage.
   Our field tests suggest that the dry porous PTn matrix is capable of
   attenuating episodic percolation fluxes in localized areas (such as
   around faults) where fast flow would be expected to dominate. Once
   wetted, the matrix is able to retain the moisture over a period of
   months. As saturation increases in the matrix, less water imbibes along
   the fault and more water travels farther along the fault. From this
   observation, we infer that a sequence of infiltration events separated
   by periods of up to a few months could convey water over increasing
   distances along the fault. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The use of capillary barriers as engineered backfill systems to divert
   water away from radioactive waste potentially stored in a Yucca Mountain
   emplacement drift is investigated. We designed and conducted a flow
   visualization experiment to investigate capillary barrier performance in
   this context. A two-dimensional, thin slab, test system replicated the
   physical emplacement drift to one-quarter scale (1.4-m diameter) and
   included the simulated drift wall, waste canister, pedestal, capillary
   barrier backfill, and host-rock fracture system. Water was supplied at
   the top of the simulated drift and allowed to discharge by way of wicks
   located along the left wall of the cell (simulated fractures) or by a
   gravity drain at the bottom of the right side (simulated impermeable
   rock with floor drain). Photographs captured the migration of water and
   a blue dye tracer within the system, analytical balances measured the
   mass balance of water, while tensiometers measured the capillary
   pressure at numerous locations. Of particular concern to this test was
   the drainage of the capillary barrier, which terminates against the
   drift wall. We found that while the simulated fractures (left side) and
   drain (right side) each influenced the performance of the capillary
   barrier at early time, they had little differential affect at later
   times. Also of concern was the small disparity in capillary properties
   between the fine and coarse layer (limited by the need of a fine-grained
   material that would not filter into the coarse layer under dry
   conditions). While the capillary barrier was able to divert the majority
   of flow toward the edges of the system and away from the simulated waste
   canister, the barrier did not preclude flow in the coarse layer, which
   was noted to be visually wet next to the waste canister on day 92 and
   was continuing to take on water at termination on day 112. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A numerical model was used to simulate the flow and transport processes
   at the Busted Butte Field Test Site for the purpose of quantifying the
   effects of hydrogeologic conditions beneath the potential Yucca Mountain
   repository horizon. In situ experiments were conducted on a 10 x 10 x 7
   m block comprising a layered Topopah Springs/Calico Hills formation with
   two imbedded faults. Tracer solution was continuously injected in eight
   parallel boreholes arranged on two horizontal planes. Twelve collection
   boreholes were emplaced perpendicular to the injection holes and were
   both horizontal and inclined. Solution samples were collected regularly
   using a sampling assembly consisting of an inverted membrane and
   sorbing-paper sampling pads. Comparisons between measurements and
   predictions show that, except for the occasional drops of concentrations
   observed in the field, the current model is able to capture the general
   characteristics of the system with varying levels of agreement using
   laboratory-measured mean hydraulic properties. Simulation results and
   field observations revealed a capillary-driven flow in the system. Good
   quantitative agreement is generally observed for near-field boreholes,
   however, this agreement deteriorates and the simulated solute
   concentration is underestimated at boreholes farther away from the
   injection points. Increasing the spatial resolution of the simulation
   improves the model predictions only to a limited extent. Scaling issues
   may need to be considered to describe flow and transport events, as the
   travel distance becomes large. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Retardation of certain radionuclides due to sorption to zeolitic
   minerals is considered one of the major barriers to contaminant
   transport in the unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain. However,
   zeolitically altered areas are lower in permeability than unaltered
   regions, which raises the possibility that contaminants might bypass the
   sorptive zeolites. The relationship between hydrologic and chemical
   properties must be understood to predict the transport of radionuclides
   through zeolitically altered areas. In this study, we incorporate
   mineralogical information into an unsaturated zone transport model using
   geostatistical techniques to correlate zeolitic abundance to hydrologic
   and chemical properties. Geostatistical methods are used to develop
   variograms, kriging maps, and conditional simulations of zeolitic
   abundance. We then investigate, using flow and transport modeling on a
   heterogeneous field, the relationship between percent zeolitic
   alteration, permeability changes due to alteration, sorption due to
   alteration, and their overall effect on adionuclide transport. We
   compare these geostatistical simulations to a simplified threshold
   method in which each spatial location in the model is assigned either
   zeolitic or vitric properties based on the zeolitic abundance at that
   location. A key conclusion is that retardation due to sorption predicted
   by using the continuous distribution is larger than the retardation
   predicted by the threshold method. The reason for larger retardation
   when using the continuous distribution is a small but significant
   sorption at locations with low zeolitic abundance. If, for practical
   reasons, models with homogeneous properties within each layer are used,
   we recommend setting nonzero K(d)s in the vitric tuffs to mimic the more
   rigorous continuous distribution simulations. Regions with high zeolitic
   abundance may not be as effective in retarding radionuclides such as
   Neptunium since these rocks are lower in permeability and contaminants
   can only enter these regions through molecular diffusion. Published by

Abstract = {{The evaluation of the Yucca Mountain site has evolved from intensive
   surface-based investigations in the early 1980s to current focus on
   testing in underground drifts. Different periods of site
   characterization activities and prominent issues concerning the
   unsaturated zone (UZ) are summarized. Data collection activities have
   evolved from mapping of faults and fractures. to estimation of
   percolation through tuff layers, and to quantification of seepage into
   drifts. Evaluation of discrete flow paths in drifts has led to
   fracture-matrix interaction and matrix diffusion tests over different
   scales. The effects of tuff interfaces and local faults are evaluated in
   fractured-welded and porous-nonwelded units. Mobilization of matrix
   water and redistribution of moisture are measured in thermal tests.
   Lessons learned from underground tests are used to focus on processes
   needed for additional quantification. Migration through the drift shadow
   zone and liquid flow through faults are two important issues that have
   evolved from current knowledge. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Analyses of pore water extracted from cores of boreholes USW SD-6 in the
   central part and USW WT-24 in the northern part of Yucca Mountain,
   Nevada, show significant vertical and lateral variations in
   dissolved-ion concentrations. Analyses of samples of only a few
   milliliters of pore water extracted by uniaxial or triaxial compression
   and by ultracentrifugation methods from adjacent core samples are
   generally in agreement, within the analytical error of 10\% to 15\%.
   However, the values of silica for water obtained by ultracentrifugation
   are consistently lower than values for water obtained by compression.
   The larger concentrations probably are due to localized pressure
   solution of silicate minerals during compression. The shallower water
   from core in borehole USW SD-6 was extracted from nonwelded units
   collectively referred to as the Paintbrush Tuff nonwelded (PTn). The
   deeper water was from core in both boreholes USW SD-6 and USW WT-24 in
   the nonwelded units referred to as the Calico Hills nonwelded (CHn).
   Significant differences in mean dissolved-ion concentrations in pore
   water between the PTn and CHn are (1) decreases in Ca, Mg, SO4, and NO3
   and (2) increases in HCO3 and (Na + K)/(Ca + Mg) ratios. The decrease in
   NO3 and the increase in HCO3 could be the result of denitrification
   through the oxidation of organic matter. The decrease in Ca and
   associated increase in (Na + K)/(Ca + Mg) is the result of ion exchange
   with zeolites in the CHn in borehole USW WT-24. This effect is not
   nearly as pronounced in borehole USW SD-6, probably reflecting a smaller
   amount of zeolitization of the CHn in USW SD-6. Geochemical calculations
   using the PHREEQC code indicate that the pore water from both boreholes
   USW SD-6 and USW WT-24 is uniformly undersaturated in anhydrite, gypsum,
   and amorphous silica, but supersaturated in quartz and chalcedony. The
   saturation of calcite, aragonite, sepiolite, and dolomite is more
   variable from sample to sample. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of parallel computing techniques to
   large-scale modeling of fluid flow in the unsaturated zone (UZ) at Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada. In this study, parallel computing techniques, as
   implemented into the TOUGH2 code, are applied in large-scale numerical
   simulations on a distributed-memory parallel computer. The modeling
   study has been conducted using an over-1-million-cell three-dimensional
   numerical model, which incorporates a wide variety of field data for the
   highly heterogeneous fractured formation at Yucca Mountain. The
   objective of this study is to analyze the impact of various surface
   infiltration scenarios (under current and possible future climates) on
   flow through the UZ system, using various hydrogeological conceptual
   models with refined grids. The results indicate that the 1-million-cell
   models produce better resolution results and reveal some flow patterns
   that cannot be obtained using coarse-grid modeling models. Published by

Abstract = {{Evaluation of radionuclide transport in the saturated zone (SZ) to the
   accessible environment is an important component of performance
   assessment for the proposed radioactive waste repository at Yucca
   Mountain. Simulations of radionuclide migration in the SZ have been
   performed using the calibrated three-dimensional (3-D) SZ site-scale
   flow and transport model. An innovative particle-tracking method was
   used to simulate transport that includes the processes of advection,
   dispersion, matrix diffusion, and sorption. The uncertainties in
   groundwater flow and radionuclide transport were quantitatively
   evaluated to develop uncertainty distributions for key model parameters,
   and multiple realizations of the SZ system were simulated using the SZ
   site-scale model. The results of multiple realizations of radionuclide
   transport indicate significant aggregate uncertainty in transport times
   through the SZ. The simulated radionuclide mass breakthrough curves in
   the SZ have been coupled with other components of the repository system
   in Total System Performance Assessment (TSPA) analyses and constitute
   the means by which uncertainty in the SZ is incorporated into regulatory
   analyses. Regression analysis has been used to determine the sensitivity
   of radionuclide transport simulation results to the uncertainty of
   individual model input parameters. Results of the sensitivity analysis
   indicate that median radionuclide transport times were dominantly
   controlled by uncertainty in the specific discharge in the SZ, with
   sorption and retardation in the alluvium playing important roles for
   some radionuclides. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Performance assessment and design evaluation of the proposed repository
   at Yucca Mountain are facilitated by a thermohydrologic modeling tool
   that simultaneously accounts for processes occurring at a scale of a few
   tens of centimeters around individual waste packages and emplacement
   drifts, and accounts for processes at the multi-kilometer scale of the
   mountain. The most straightforward approach is to account for the 3-D
   drift- and mountain-scale dimensionality all within a single monolithic
   thermohydrologic model. This approach is too computationally expensive
   to be a viable simulation tool capable of addressing all waste-package
   locations in the repository. The Multiscale Thermohydrologic Model
   (MSTHM) is a computationally efficient alternative to addressing these
   modeling issues. In this paper, we describe the principal calculation
   stages to predict temperature, relative humidity, and liquid-saturation,
   as well as other thermohydrologic variables, in the drifts and in the
   host rock. Using a three-drift repository example (which is a
   scaled-down version of the proposed repository), we demonstrate the
   validity of the MSTHM approach against a nested monolithic
   thermohydrologic model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We report results from a multi-scale thermohydrologic modeling study for
   two alternative thermal-operating modes for the potential repository
   system recently analyzed by the Yucca Mountain Project. These include a
   Higher-Temperature Operating Mode (HTOM), which results in a localized
   boiling zone around each emplacement drift, and a Lower-Temperature
   Operating Mode (LTOM), which always maintains sub-boiling temperatures
   throughout the repository. The HTOM places all waste packages nearly end
   to end, making the lineal power density greater than in the LTOM. The
   lower lineal power density in the LTOM was achieved by placing some
   waste packages farther apart (which results in a larger repository
   footprint), and through an increased reliance on pre-closure ventilation
   to remove the waste-package-generated heat. We focus on temperature T
   and relative humidity RH at the waste-package and drift-wall surfaces,
   and on in-drift evaporation. In general, HTOM temperatures are greater
   than corresponding LTOM temperatures, exhibit similar spatial
   variability and have a stronger dependence on infiltration flux. The
   duration of RH reduction on waste packages is similar for the LTOM and
   HTOM. A major difference between the LTOM and HTOM is the lower
   waste-package temperature at any given value of waste-package RH for the
   LTOM. Waste-package temperatures in the LTOM, by design, remain below
   similar to85degreesC; the absence of RH reduction arising from host-rock
   dryout causes waste-package RH to remain above about 40\%. The HTOM
   waste packages experience higher temperatures and correspondingly lower
   RH conditions as a result of RH reduction arising from host-rock dryout.
   For most of the repository area, the HTOM delays the potential onset of
   gravity-driven seepage compared to the LTOM (as indicated by the
   duration of boiling at the drift wall). Boiling conditions in the HTOM
   also delays the onset of capillary-driven seepage into the granular
   invert, causing the HTOM to have less evaporation in the invert during
   the first 800-1500 years than the LTOM; subsequent evaporation rates are
   higher in the HTOM, due to the higher power density. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Plugging of flow paths caused by mineral precipitation in fractures
   above the potential repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada could reduce
   the probability of water seeping into the repository. As part of an
   ongoing effort to evaluate thermal-hydrological-chemical (THC) effects
   on flow in fractured media, we performed a laboratory experiment and
   numerical simulations to investigate mineral dissolution and
   precipitation under anticipated temperature and pressure conditions in
   the repository. To replicate mineral dissolution by vapor condensate in
   fractured tuff, water was flowed through crushed Yucca Mountain tuff at
   94 degreesC. The resulting steady-state fluid composition had a total
   dissolved solids content of about 140 mg/l; silica was the dominant
   dissolved constituent. A portion of the steady-state mineralized water
   was flowed into a vertically oriented planar fracture in a block of
   welded Topopah Spring Tuff that was maintained at 80 degreesC at the top
   and 130 degreesC at the bottom. The fracture began to seal with
   amorphous silica within 5 days.
   A I-D plug-flow numerical model was used to simulate mineral
   dissolution, and a similar model was developed to simulate the flow of
   mineralized water through a planar fracture, where boiling conditions
   led to mineral precipitation. Predicted concentrations of the major
   dissolved constituents for the tuff dissolution were within a factor of
   2 of the measured average steady-state compositions. The mineral
   precipitation simulations predicted the precipitation of amorphous
   silica at the base of the boiling front, leading to a greater than
   50-fold decrease in fracture permeability in 5 days, consistent with the
   laboratory experiment.
   These results help validate the use of a numerical model to simulate THC
   processes at Yucca Mountain. The experiment and simulations indicated
   that boiling and concomitant precipitation of amorphous silica could
   cause significant reductions in fracture porosity and permeability on a
   local scale. However, differences in fluid flow rates and thermal
   gradients between the experimental setup and anticipated conditions at
   Yucca Mountain need to be factored into scaling the results of the
   dissolution/precipitation experiments and associated simulations to THC
   models for the potential Yucca Mountain repository. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The US Department of Energy is pursuing Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for the
   development of a geologic repository for the disposal of spent nuclear
   fuel and high-level radioactive waste, if the repository is able to meet
   applicable radiation protection standards established by the US Nuclear
   Regulatory Commission and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
   Effective performance of such a repository would rely on a number of
   `natural and engineered barriers to isolate radioactive waste from the
   accessible environment. Groundwater beneath Yucca Mountain is the
   primary medium through which most radionuclides might move away from the
   potential repository. The saturated zone (SZ) system is expected to act
   as a natural barrier to this possible movement of radionuclides both by
   delaying their transport and by reducing their concentration before they
   reach the accessible environment. Information obtained from Yucca
   Mountain Site Characterization Project activities is used to estimate
   groundwater flow rates through the site-scale SZ flow and transport
   model area and to constrain general conceptual models of groundwater
   flow in the site-scale area. The site-scale conceptual model is a
   synthesis of what is known about flow and transport processes at the
   scale required for total system performance assessment of the site. This
   knowledge builds on and is consistent with knowledge that has
   accumulated at the regional scale but is more detailed because more data
   are available at the site-scale level. The mathematical basis of the
   site-scale model and the associated numerical approaches are designed to
   assist in quantifying the uncertainty in the permeability of rocks in
   the geologic framework model and to represent accurately the flow and
   transport processes included in the site-scale conceptual model.
   Confidence in the results of the mathematical model was obtained by
   comparing calculated to observed hydraulic heads, estimated to measured
   permeabilities, and lateral flow rates calculated by the site-scale
   model to those calculated by the regional-scale flow model. In addition,
   it was confirmed that the flow paths leaving the region of the potential
   repository are consistent with those inferred from gradients of measured
   head and those independently inferred from water-chemistry data. The
   general approach of the site-scale SZ flow and transport model analysis
   is to calculate unit breakthrough curves for radionuclides at the
   interface between the SZ and the biosphere using the three-dimensional
   site-scale SZ flow and transport model. Uncertainties are explicitly
   incorporated into the site-scale SZ flow and transport abstractions
   through key parameters and conceptual models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Regulatory requirements and scientific needs require that the response
   of the geological system to emplacement of high level radioactive waste
   be monitored for long time periods. This monitoring activity is intended
   to establish the extent to which predicted behavior matches the actual
   response of the geological system to waste emplacement. To accomplish
   this goal, field measurements must be made at a spatial resolution that
   will determine whether the changes in parameters that are monitored
   conform to predicted evolutionary patterns. From the perspective of
   thermohydrological and geochemical parameters, key measurements will
   consider pore water compositional evolution and changes in matrix and
   fracture saturation in the near vicinity of waste emplacement tunnels. A
   massively parallel high performance computational platform (a 1200
   processor IBM SP-2) was used to conduct three-dimensional, high
   resolution simulations to ascertain the spatial variability to be
   expected during a monitoring period. The results show that spatial
   variability in certain chemical parameters below waste emplacement
   tunnels provides robust targets for monitoring, but will require
   sampling on the scale of 10 s of centimeters in some locations, in order
   to rigorously test models. Chemical variability induced by relatively
   small changes in waste package heat output suggests that designing a
   monitoring program that will rigorously test model predictions will
   likely require high resolution, three-dimensional simulations of the
   ``as-built{''} monitoring tunnels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A numerical model was used to investigate the effect of spatial
   variability in fracture permeability on liquid seepage and moisture
   distribution in the vicinity of a waste emplacement drift in the
   unsaturated zone (UZ) of Yucca Mountain. The model is based on a
   two-dimensional, cross-sectional, dual-permeability model of the
   unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain and uses a stochastic approach to
   investigate the effect of small-scale heterogeneous features. The
   studies were conducted using one uniform fracture permeability case,
   three realizations of stochastically generated fracture permeability,
   one discrete permeability feature case, and one increased ambient liquid
   flux case. In all cases, the models predict that completely dry drift
   conditions will develop above and below the drift in 10-100 years and
   remain dry for 1000-2000 years. During this period, the models predict
   no seepage into drifts, although liquid flux above the drifts and within
   the drift pillars may increase by up to two orders of magnitude above
   ambient flux. This is because the heat released by the emplaced waste is
   sufficient to vaporize liquid flux of one to two orders of magnitude
   higher than present-day ambient flux for over 1000 years. The results
   also show that unsaturated zone thermal hydrological (TH) models with
   uniform layer permeability can adequately predict the evolution of
   seepage and moisture distribution in the rock mass surrounding the
   repository drifts. The models further show that although variability in
   fracture permeability may focus and enhance liquid flow in regions of
   enhanced liquid saturation (due to condensation above the drifts),
   vaporization and vapor diffusion can maintain a dry environment within
   the drifts for thousands of years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents a numerical study on the response of the unsaturated
   zone (UZ) system of Yucca Mountain to heat generated from decaying
   radioactive wastes emplaced at the proposed repository. The modeling
   study is based on the current thermal-hydrological (TH) mountain-scale
   model, which uses a locally refined, 2D north-south cross-section and
   dual-permeability numerical approach. The model provides a prediction of
   the mountain-scale TH response under the thermal-load scenario of 1.45
   kW/m, while accounting for future climatic changes and the effects of
   drift ventilation. The TH simulation results show that ventilation of
   the repository drifts has a large impact on thermal-hydrologic regimes
   and moisture-flow conditions at the repository. In both cases, with and
   without ventilation, the TH model predicts dry or reduced liquid
   saturation near the drifts for over 1000 years, during which liquid flux
   through the drifts is reduced to either zero or less than the ambient
   flux. Without ventilation, the model predicts higher temperatures at the
   repository, but no major moisture redistribution in the UZ except in the
   areas very near the heated drifts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Geochemical and microbiological modeling was performed to evaluate the
   potential quantities and impact of microorganisms on the geochemistry of
   the area adjacent to and within nuclear waste packages in the proposed
   repository drifts at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The microbial growth
   results from the introduction of water, ground support, and waste
   package materials into the deep unsaturated rock. The simulations, which
   spanned I million years, were accomplished using a newly developed
   computer code, Microbial Impacts to the Near-Field Environment
   Geochemistry (MING). MING uses environmental thresholds for limiting
   microbial growth to temperatures below 120 degreesC and above relative
   humidities of 90\% in repository drifts. Once these thresholds are met,
   MING expands upon a mass balance and thermodynamic approach proposed by
   McKinley et al. {[}FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 20 (1997) 545] by using kinetic
   rates to supply constituents from design materials and constituent
   fluxes including solubilized rock components into the drift to perform
   two separate mass balance calculations as a function of time. The first
   (nutrient limit) assesses the available nutrients (C, N, P and S) and
   calculates how many microorganisms can be produced based on a
   microorganism stoichiometry Of C-160(H280O80)N30P2S. The second (energy
   limit) calculates the energy available from optimally combined redox
   couples for the temperature and pH at that time. This optimization
   maximizes those reactions that produce >15 kJ/mol (limit on useable
   energy) using an iterative linear optimization technique. The final
   available energy value is converted to microbial mass at a rate of I kg
   of biomass (dry weight) for every 64 MJ of energy. These two values
   (nutrient limit and energy limit) are then compared and the smaller
   value represents the number of microorganisms that can be produced over
   a specified time. MING can also be adapted to investigate other problems
   of interest as the model can be used in saturated and unsaturated
   environments and in laboratory situations to establish microbial growth
   limitations. Other projected uses include investigations of contaminated
   locations where monitored natural attenuation or engineered
   bioremediation could be employed. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Highly resolved numerical simulations are conducted to evaluate the
   longitudinal and transverse dispersivities proposed for use in the
   larger-scale Yucca Mountain saturated zone (SZ) site-scale model. Two
   different stochastic continuum models (SCM) that define the spatial
   variability of permeability are inferred from the observed fracture
   characteristics and the measured permeabilities. These models are
   created with a combination of indicator geostatistics and boolean
   simulation that allow for modeling different correlation lengths and
   anisotropy ratios at different permeability thresholds as well as the
   inclusion of large, high-permeability features. Longitudinal and
   transverse (horizontal and vertical) dispersion through the permeability
   realizations is evaluated for both distributed and focused source
   geometries using groundwater flow and streamline particle tracking.
   These numerical results are compared to behavior predicted by an
   analytical solution and to dispersivities estimated by an expert panel.
   Early time transport results are significantly non-Gaussian due to the
   strong heterogeneity of the fractured medium. At late times, travel
   distances of 23 correlation lengths, the longitudinal and transverse
   horizontal dispersivity results are well approximated by the analytical
   solution and the expert elicitation estimates. The calculated transverse
   vertical dispersivity values are smaller than those estimated from the
   analytical solution. Inclusion of high-permeability features of the same
   size as the model domain with a distributed planar source creates
   extreme values of the longitudinal and transverse horizontal
   dispersivity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding thermally driven coupled hydrological, mechanical, and
   chemical processes in unsaturated fractured tuff is essential for
   evaluating the performance of the potential radioactive waste repository
   at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. The Drift Scale Test (DST), intended for
   acquiring such an understanding of these processes, has generated a huge
   volume of temperature and moisture redistribution data. Sophisticated
   thermal-hydrological (TH) conceptual models have yielded a good fit
   between simulation results and those measured data. However, some
   uncertainties in understanding the TH processes associated with the DST
   still exist. This paper evaluates these uncertainties and provides
   quantitative estimates of the range of these uncertainties. Of
   particular interest for the DST are the uncertainties resulting from the
   unmonitored loss of vapor through an open bulkhead of the test. There
   was concern that the outcome from the test might have been significantly
   altered by these losses. Using alternative conceptual models, we
   illustrate that predicted mean temperatures from the DST are within I
   degreesC of the measured mean temperatures through the first 2 years of
   heating. The simulated spatial and temporal evolution of drying and
   condensation fronts is found to be qualitatively consistent with
   measured saturation data. Energy and mass balance computation shows that
   no more than 13\% of the input energy is lost because of vapor leaving
   the test domain through the bulkhead. The change in average saturation
   in fractures is also relatively small. For a hypothetical situation in
   which no vapor is allowed to exit through the bulkhead, the simulated
   average fracture saturation is not qualitatively different enough to be
   discerned by measured moisture redistribution data. This leads us to
   conclude that the DST, despite the uncertainties associated with open
   field testing, has provided an excellent understanding of the TH
   processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two cross-hole tracer tests involving the simultaneous injection of two
   nonsorbing solute tracers with different diffusion coefficients (bromide
   and pentafluorobenzoate) and one weakly sorbing solute tracer (lithium
   ion) were conducted in two different intervals at the C-wells complex
   near the site of a potential high-level nuclear waste repository at
   Yucca Mountain, NV The tests were conducted to (1) test a conceptual
   radionuclide transport model for saturated, fractured tuffs near Yucca
   Mountain and (2) obtain transport parameter estimates for predictive
   modeling of radionuclide transport. The differences between the
   responses of the two nonsorbing tracers and the sorbing tracer (when
   normalized to injection masses) were consistent with a dual-porosity
   transport system in which matrix diffusion was occurring. The
   concentration attenuation of the sorbing tracer relative to the
   nonsorbing tracers suggested that diffusion occurred primarily into
   matrix pores, not simply into stagnant water within the fractures. The
   K-d values deduced from the lithium responses were generally larger than
   K-d values measured in laboratory batch sorption tests using crushed
   C-wells cores. This result supports the use of laboratory-derived K-d
   values for predicting sorbing species transport at the site, as the
   laboratory K-d values would result in underprediction of sorption and
   hence conservative transport predictions. The tracer tests also provided
   estimates of effective flow porosity and longitudinal dispersivity at
   the site. The tests clearly demonstrated the advantages of using
   multiple tracers of different physical and chemical characteristics to
   distinguish between alternative conceptual transport models and to
   obtain transport parameter estimates that are better constrained than
   can be obtained using only a single tracer or using multiple nonsorbing
   tracers without a sorbing tracer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A coupled thermal, hydrologic and mechanical (THM) analysis is conducted
   to evaluate the impact of coupled THM processes on the performance of a

   as well as those caused by thermomechanically induced rock deformations
   after emplacement of the heat-generating waste. The analysis consists of
   a detailed calibration of coupled hydraulic-mechanical rock mass
   properties against field experiments, followed by a prediction of the
   coupled thermal, hydrologic, and mechanical behavior around a potential
   repository drift. For the particular problem studied and parameters
   used, the analysis indicates that the stress-induced permeability
   changes will be within one order of magnitude and that these

Abstract = {{The evolution of fluid chemistry and mineral alteration around a
   potential waste emplacement tunnel (drift) is evaluated using numerical
   modeling. The model considers the flow of water, gas, and heat, plus
   reactions between minerals, CO2 gas, and aqueous species, and
   porosity-permeability-capillary pressure coupling for a dual
   permeability (fractures and matrix) medium. Two possible operating
   temperature modes are investigated: a ``high-temperature{''} case with
   temperatures exceeding the boiling point of water for several hundred
   years, and a ``'low-temperature{''} case with temperatures remaining
   below boiling for the entire life of the repository. In both cases,
   possible seepage waters are characterized by dilute to moderate
   salinities and mildly alkaline pH values. These trends in fluid
   composition and mineral alteration are controlled by various coupled
   mechanisms. For example, upon heating and boiling, CO2 exsolution from
   pore waters raises pH and causes calcite precipitation. In condensation
   zones, this CO2 redissolves, resulting in a decrease in pH that causes
   calcite dissolution and enhances feldspar alteration to clays. Heat also
   enhances dissolution of wall rock minerals leading to elevated silica
   concentrations. Amorphous silica precipitates through evaporative
   concentration caused by boiling in the high-temperature case, but does
   not precipitate in the low-temperature case. Some alteration of
   feldspars to clays and zeolites is predicted in the high-temperature
   case. In both cases, calcite precipitates when percolating waters are
   heated near the drift. The predicted porosity decrease around drifts in
   the high-temperature case (several percent of the fracture volume) is
   larger by at least one order of magnitude than in the low temperature
   case. Although there are important differences between the two
   investigated temperature modes in the predicted evolution of fluid
   compositions and mineral alteration around drifts, these differences are
   largely within to the model uncertainty and the variability of water
   compositions at Yucca Mountain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A weakly sorbing cation, lithium, will be used as a reactive tracer in
   upcoming field tracer tests in the saturated alluvium south of Yucca
   Mountain, Nevada. One objective of the field tests is to determine how
   well field-scale reactive transport can be predicted using transport
   parameters derived from laboratory experiments. This paper describes
   several laboratory lithium batch sorption and column transport
   experiments that were conducted using ground water and alluvium obtained
   from the site of the planned field tests. In the batch experiments,
   isotherms were determined over 2.5 orders of magnitude of lithium
   concentrations, corresponding to the range expected in the field tests.
   In addition to measuring equilibrium lithium concentrations,
   concentrations of other cations, namely Na+, K+, and Ca2+ were measured
   in the batch tests to determine Li+ -exchangeable equilibria. This
   information was used in conjunction with alluvium cation exchange
   capacity measurements to parameterize a three-component cation-exchange
   model (EQUIL) that describes lithium sorption in the alluvium system.
   This model was then applied to interpret the transport behavior of
   lithium ion in saturated alluvium column tests conducted at three
   different lithium bromide injection concentrations. The concentrations
   were selected such that lithium ion either dominated, accounted for a
   little over half, or accounted for only a small fraction of the total
   cation equivalents in the injection solution. Although tracer
   breakthrough curves differed significantly under each of these
   conditions, with highly asymmetric responses occurring at the highest
   injection concentrations, the three-component cation-exchange model
   reproduced the observed transport behavior of lithium and the other
   cations in each case with a similar set of model parameters. In
   contrast, a linear K-d-type sorption model could only match the lithium
   responses at the lowest injection concentration. The three-component
   model will be used to interpret the field tests, with the expectation
   that it will help refine estimates of effective flow porosity,
   particularly if the lithium response curves are asymmetric. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Several numerical codes have been used to simulate radionuclide
   transport in fractured rock systems. The validation of such numerical
   codes can be accomplished by comparison of numerical simulations against
   appropriate analytical solutions. In this paper, we present analytical
   solutions for the reactive transport of N-member radionuclide chains
   (i.e., multiple species of radionuclides and their daughter species)
   through a discrete fracture in a porous rock matrix applying a system
   decomposition approach. We consider the transport of N-member
   radionuclide chains in a single-fracture-matrix system as a starting
   point to simulate more realistic and complex systems. The processes
   considered are advection. along the fracture, lateral diffusion in the
   matrix, radioactive decay of multiple radionuclides, and adsorption in
   both the fracture and matrix. Different retardation factors can be
   specified for the fracture and matrix. However, all species are assumed
   to share the same retardation factors for the fracture and matrix,
   respectively. Although a daughter species may penetrate farther along
   the fracture than its parent species when a constant-concentration
   boundary condition is applied, our results indicate that all species
   retain the same transport speed in the fracture if a pulse of the first
   species is released into the fracture. This solution scheme provides a
   way to validate numerical computer codes of radionuclide transport in
   fractured rock, such as those being used to assess the performance of a
   potential nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Thermally induced natural convection from the heat produced by emplaced
   waste packages is an important heat and mass transfer mechanism within
   the Yucca Mountain Project (YMP) drifts. Various models for analyzing
   natural convection have been employed. The equivalent porous medium
   approach using Darcy's law has been used in many YMP applications.
   However, this approach has questionable fidelity, especially for
   turbulent flow conditions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), which is
   based on the fundamental Navier-Stokes equations, is currently being
   evaluated as a technique to calculate thermally induced natural
   convection in YMP. Data-model comparisons for turbulent flow conditions
   show good agreement of CFD predictions with existing experiments
   including YMP-specific data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents several different conceptual models of the Large
   Hydraulic Gradient (LHG) region north of Yucca Mountain and describes
   the impact of those models on groundwater flow near the potential
   high-level repository site. The results are based on a numerical model
   of site-scale saturated zone beneath Yucca Mountain. This model is used
   for performance assessment predictions of radionuclide transport and to
   guide future data collection and modeling activities. The numerical
   model is calibrated by matching available water level measurements using
   parameter estimation techniques, along with more informal comparisons of
   the model to hydrologic and geochemical information. The model software
   (hydrologic simulation code FEHM and parameter estimation software PEST)
   and model setup allows for efficient calibration of multiple conceptual
   models. Until now, the Large Hydraulic Gradient has been simulated using
   a low-permeability, east-west oriented feature, even though direct
   evidence for this feature is lacking. In addition to this model, we
   investigate and calibrate three additional conceptual models of the
   Large Hydraulic Gradient, all of which are based on a presumed zone of
   hydrothermal chemical alteration north of Yucca Mountain. After
   examining the heads and permeabilities obtained from the calibrated
   models, we present particle pathways from the potential repository that
   record differences in the predicted groundwater flow regime. The results
   show that Large Hydraulic Gradient can be represented with the alternate
   conceptual models that include the hydrothermally altered zone. The
   predicted pathways are mildly sensitive to the choice of the conceptual
   model and more sensitive to the quality of calibration in the vicinity
   on the repository. These differences are most likely due to different
   degrees of fit of model to data, and do not represent important
   differences in hydrologic conditions for the different conceptual
   models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of colloid generation from cement hydrates in a
   cementitious repository environment has-been investigated through
   leaching experiments. Pulverized samples of High Flyash and Silica
   fume-content Cement (HFSC) and 1:9 ordinary portland cement/blast
   furnace slag (1:9 OPC/BFS) hydrate were leached in low-salinity
   groundwater,at three solid-to-liquid (S/L) mass ratios (1:5, 1:50 and
   1:100), and two temperatures (20 and 60degreesC) for durations of nearly
   2 and 8 months. Detailed characterization of colloid populations has
   been undertaken by TEM coupled with X-ray analysis. In addition, the
   surface charge and stability behavior of colloids have been
   investigated. The colloid concentrations in HFSC hydrate leachates
   generated at 20 and 60degreesC show similar trends with S/L ratio. The
   colloid concentrations of leachates with the lower S/L ratio (1:50 and
   1:100) are in the range of 10(11)-10(12) particles per liter. The
   majority of these particles are composed predominantly of Si, Ca, and
   Al; the mean particle size is less than 100 nm. The lowest colloid
   concentrations are found in the leachates with the highest S/L ratios,
   and the colloid populations tend to be dominated by larger particles.
   HFSC-derived colloid stability is due to a high negative zeta potential
   at alkaline pH values, combined with a calcium concentration that is
   below the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) for the colloids. A
   preliminary interpretation of HFSC-derived colloid stability based on
   classical DLVO theory provides a semi-quantitative explanation of the
   dependence of colloid populations on the S/L ratio in the leaching
   experiments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The possible mechanisms of colloid generation at the near field/far
   field interface of a radioactive repository have been investigated by
   means of novel column experiments simulating the granite/bentonite
   boundary, both in dynamic and in quasi-static water flow conditions. It
   has been shown that solid particles and colloids can be detached from
   the bulk and mobilised by the water flow. The higher the flow rate, the
   higher the concentration of particles found in the water, according to
   an erosion process. However, the gel formation and the intrinsic tactoid
   structure of the clay play an important role in the submicron particle
   generation even in the compacted clay and in a confined system. In fact,
   once a bentonite gel is formed, in the regions where the clay is
   contacted with water, clay colloids can be formed even in quasi-static
   flow conditions. The potential relevance of these colloids in
   radionuclide transport has been studied by evaluating their stability in
   different chemical environments. The coagulation kinetics of natural
   bentonite colloids was experimentally studied as a function of the ionic
   strength and pH, by means of time-resolved light scattering techniques.
   It has been shown that these colloids are very stable in low saline
   (similar to1 x 10(-3) M) and alkaline (pH greater than or equal to 8)
   waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A lack of information in databases for contamination risk assessment
   about the transport behaviour of the trivalent f-orbital elements in
   groundwater systems where calcite is at equilibrium motivated this study
   of Eu3+ uptake. The free drift technique was used to examine the effects
   of Eu3+ concentration, presence of Na+ or K+ and temperature, as well as
   calcite nucleation and precipitation kinetics, on the partitioning of
   calcite. Changes in surface composition and morphology resulting from
   exposure of single crystals of Iceland spar to Eu3+-bearing solutions
   were observed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic
   force microscopy (AFM). First results confirm that calcite has high
   affinity for Eu3+. Rates of nucleation and precipitation strongly affect
   the extent of uptake but the presence of Na+ and K+ has no effect,
   suggesting formation of solid solution as CaCO3-EuOHCO3.
   Surface-sensitive techniques prove that Eu3+ is adsorbed to calcite even
   when the surface is dissolving and adsorption is not accompanied by
   precipitation of a separate Eu3+-solid phase. Adsorbed Eu modifies
   calcite's dissolution behaviour, roughening terraces and rounding step
   edges, and producing surface morphology where some surface sites appear
   blocked. Results imply that Eu3+ concentrations in natural calcites are
   limited by Eu3+ availability rather than by a lack of ability to fit
   into calcite's atomic structure. This behaviour can probably be expected
   for other trivalent rare Earth elements (REE), actinides and fission
   products whose behaviour is similar to that of Eu3+. These elements are
   likely to be incorporated within the calcite bulk in systems where it is
   precipitating and the demonstrated strong partitioning ensures some
   uptake even where calcite is at or under saturation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Diffusion experiments through hardened cement pastes (HCP) using
   tritiated water (HTO) and Na-22(+), considered to be conservative
   tracers, have been carried out in triplicates in a glove box under a
   controlled nitrogen atmosphere. Each experiment consisted of a
   through-diffusion test followed by an out-diffusion test.
   The experimental data were inversely modelled applying an automated
   Marquardt-Levenberg procedure. The analysis of the through-diffusion
   data allowed the extraction of values for the effective diffusion
   coefficients, D-e, and the rock capacity factor, alpha. Good agreement
   between measured and calculated tracer breakthrough curves was achieved
   using both a simple diffusion model without sorption and a
   diffusion/linear sorption model.
   The best-fit K-d-values were found to be consistent with R-d-values
   measured in previous batch-sorption experiments. The best-fit values
   from the through-diffusion tests were then used to predict the results
   of subsequent out-diffusion experiments. Good agreement between
   experimental data and predictions was achieved only for the case of
   linear sorption.
   Isotopic exchange can only partially account for both the amount of
   tracer taken up in the batch-sorption tests and the measured retardation
   in the diffusion experiments and, hence, additional mechanisms have to
   be invoked to explain the data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Effective diffusion coefficients (D-e) are usually measured by means of
   ``through-diffusion{''} experiments in which steady state is reached,
   and the ``time-lag{''} methods are used to estimate the apparent
   diffusion coefficient (D-a). For sorbing radionuclides (as caesium), the
   time needed to reach steady-state conditions is very large, and the
   precision in D-a determinations is not satisfactory.
   In this paper, a method that allows determining simultaneously effective
   and apparent diffusion coefficients in compacted bentonite without
   reaching steady-state conditions is described. Basically, this method
   consists of an ``in-diffusion{''} experiment in which the concentration
   profile in the bentonite sample is used to estimate D-a, and the
   temporal evolution of the solute concentration in the reservoir is used
   to estimate D-e. This method has several advantages over the typical
   ``through-diffusion{''} experiments, in particular: (a) experiment
   duration is significantly shorter, (b) D-a values are measured with
   greater precision and (c) it is not necessary to maintain a constant
   solute concentration in the reservoir.
   This new method has been used to estimate the effective and apparent
   diffusion coefficients for caesium in FEBEX bentonite and in order to
   validate it, the results have been compared with results previously
   obtained with standard methods. Experimental results have been
   satisfactorily modelled using a simple model of diffusion in porewater
   and the measured value of D-e(Cs) is very similar to D-e(HTO) in the
   same bentonite. There is no evidence of ``surface diffusion{''} in FEBEX
   bentonite for caesium. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights

   rock capacity factors (a) are: D-e = 1.2-1.5 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1) and
   alpha = 0.09-0.11 for HTO, D-e = 4.0-5.5 x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) and alpha
   = 0.05 for Cl-36(-) and D-e = 3.2-4.6 x 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) and alpha =
   0.07-0.10 for I-125(-). For non-sorbing tracers (HTO, Cl-36) the rock
   capacity factor a is equal to the diffusion-accessible porosity epsilon.
   The experimental results showed that pressure only had a small effect on
   the value of the diffusion coefficients. Increasing the pressure from 1
   to 5 MPa resulted in a decrease of the diffusion coefficient of similar
   to17\% for HTO, similar to28\% for Cl-36(-) and similar to30\% for
   I-125(-). Moreover, the diffusion coefficients for Cl-36(-) and I-125(-)
   are smaller than for HTO, which is consistent with an effect arising
   from anion exclusion.
   The diffusion coefficients of HTO and I-125(-) measured in this study
   are in good agreement with recent measurements at three other
   laboratories performed within the framework of a laboratory comparison
   exercise. The values of the diffusion-accessible porosities show a
   larger degree of scatter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. all rights

Abstract = {{The effect of silica sand on the diffusion of sodium ions in mixtures of
   montmorillonite and silica sand was studied by measuring the apparent
   diffusion coefficients, activation energies for diffusion, and the basal
   spacing of the mixed samples. These diffusion experiments suggest that
   the apparent diffusion coefficients of sodium ions in the mixed samples
   were almost the same as those of pure montmorillonite samples having the
   same partial dry densities of montmorillonite. The activation energy
   dependence for diffusion of sodium ions on the partial dry density was
   different between the mixed samples and the pure montmorillonite
   samples. The activation energy increased by adding silica sand at the
   partial dry density of 1.0 Mg m(-3), and decreased by adding silica sand
   at the partial dry densities higher than 1.2 Mg m(-3). A change in the
   XRD profile was observed after adding silica sand at the partial dry
   density of 1.6 Mg m(-3). Here, a three-water-layer hydrate state of
   montmorillonite was found in the mixed sample whereas only a
   two-water-layer hydrate state was observed in the pure montmorillonite
   sample. These experimental results suggest that silica sand changed the
   montmorillonite microstructure in the mixed samples, which then altered
   the sodium-ion diffusion process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Hydrated bentonite is a very plastic material and it is expected to
   enter in the rock microfractures at the granite/bentonite boundary of a
   deep geological high-level waste repository. This process is enhanced by
   the high swelling pressure of the clay. Since bentonite has a very good
   sorption capability for many radionuclides, the displacement of the clay
   might lead to a ``clay-mediated{''} contaminant transport into the rock.
   The aim of this work is to study the contaminant transport into granite
   microfractures using nuclear ion beam techniques, and to determine to
   what extent the clay can favour it. To do so, bentonite previously doped
   with uranium, cesium and europium was put in contact with the surface of
   granite sheets. Granite sheets contacted with non-doped bentonite and
   with radionuclide solutions were also prepared as references. This
   allowed analysing the differences in the diffusion behaviour of the
   three systems: clay, radionuclides and clay plus radionuclides.
   A combination of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and other
   nuclear ion-beam techniques such as particle-induced X-ray emission
   (PIXE) and microPIXE was used to study the depth and lateral
   distribution of clay and contaminants inside granite. It was also tried
   to evaluate not only the diffusion depth and diffusion coefficients but
   also the different areas of the granite where the diffusants have a
   preferential access. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new in situ method for obtaining the formation factor,
   which is essential for the matrix diffusion, is described and tested in
   intrusive igneous rock. The method is based on electrical resistivity
   measurements in rock where the pore water and rock resistivities are
   essential parameters. The method is based on electromigration instead of
   diffusion as in traditional diffusion experiments. In previous works,
   quantitative formation factors of rock have been obtained by electrical
   methods in the laboratory. Here, a similar approach is used in situ. An
   in situ logging campaign was performed by SKB during 2000 in the
   1700-m-deep borehole KLX02 in Laxemar, Sweden. The rock resistivity was
   measured with the slimhole Dual Laterolog from Antares. The groundwater
   resistivity was measured with the Difference Flow Meter from Posiva. A
   formation factor log was obtained with the maximum vertical resolution
   of 10 cm. In order to validate the log, 100 rock samples were taken from
   the bore core, and a formation factor log was obtained by using
   electrical methods in the laboratory. Both direct current (DC) and
   alternating current (AC) were used. The measurements on the core
   confirmed that the in situ log was quantitative, but with a possible
   systematic error. The in situ formation factors were on average about
   1/3 to 1/5 of the laboratory formation factors, depending on depth. (C)

Abstract = {{A mathematical model describing the dissolution of nuclear glass
   directly disposed in clay combines a first-order dissolution rate law
   with the diffusion of dissolved silica in clay. According to this model,
   the main parameters describing the long-term dissolution of the glass
   are etaR, the product of the diffusion accessible porosity 71 and the
   retardation factor R, and the apparent diffusion coefficient D-app of
   dissolved silica in clay.
   For determining the migration parameters needed for long-term
   predictions, four Through-Diffusion (T D) experiments and one
   percolation test have been performed on undisturbed clay cores. In the
   Through-Diffusion experiments, the concentration decrease after
   injection of Si-32 (radioactive labelled silica) was measured in the
   inlet compartment. At the end of the T-D experiments, the clay cores
   were cut in thin slices and the activity of labelled silica in each
   slice was determined. The measured activity profiles for these four clay
   cores are well reproducible.
   Since no labelled silica could be detected in the outlet compartments,
   the Through-Diffusion experiments are fitted by two In-Diffusion models:
   one model assuming linear and reversible sorption equilibrium and a
   second model taking into account sorption kinetics. Although the kinetic
   model provides better fits, due to the sufficiently long duration of the
   experiments, both models give approximately similar values for the fit
   parameters. The single percolation test leads to an apparent diffusion
   coefficient value about two to three times lower than those of the
   Through-Diffusion tests.
   Therefore, dissolved silica appears to be strongly retarded in Boom
   Clay. A retardation factor R between 100 and 300 was determined. The
   corresponding in situ distribution coefficient K-d is in the range 25-75
   cm(3) g(-1). The apparent diffusion coefficient of dissolved silica in
   Boom Clay is estimated between 2 x 10(-13) and 7 x 10(-13) m(2) s(-1).
   The pore diffusion coefficient is in the range from 6 x 10(-11) to 1 x
   10(-10) m(2) s(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical basis for matrix diffusion in fractured rocks and the
   methodology for the determination of diffusion coefficients in the
   laboratory are well established. One significant problem, however,
   remains in that it is difficult to quantify the degree of sample
   disturbance affecting the geometrical, geophysical and hydraulic
   properties of the rock matrix.
   A new technique, with in situ rock impregnation with resin, for
   examining the diffusion-accessible rock matrix has been developed and
   successfully adopted to the rock matrix behind a water-conducting
   fracture in host crystalline rocks at Nagra's Grimsel Test Site in
   Switzerland and JNC's Kamaishi In Situ Test Site in Japan. In line with
   the results of a large number of natural analogue and laboratory
   studies, the existence of an in situ interconnected pore network was
   substantiated. Matrix porosities determined on the laboratory samples
   from both the sites are 1.5-3 times higher than in situ values,
   irrespective of the technique applied. On the Grimsel granodiorite
   matrix, matrix porosity existing in situ and artefacts of stress release
   and physical disturbance, induced by sampling and sample preparation,
   were clearly distinguished, allowing in situ porosity to be quantified.
   Laboratory work with conventional techniques tends to overestimate the
   porosity of the rock matrix, hence leading to an overestimation of in
   situ matrix diffusion. The implications of these differences to a
   repository performance assessment are assessed with a couple of examples
   from existing assessments, and recommendations for future approaches to
   the examination of in situ matrix porosity are made. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) was applied to the measurement of
   the diffusion coefficients of heavy ions in an artificial barrier
   material for the disposal of nuclear wastes. Cs+, Sr2+, I-, and Br- are
   the heavy ions measured and the barrier used is the water-rich gel of
   Wyoming montmorillonite (86.5-100 wt.\% H2O). X-ray CT yields an
   inevitable artifact (beam-hardening) in the obtained images. Before the
   diffusion experiments, the polychromatic primary X-ray spectrum of the
   CT scanner was measured by a CdZnTe detector, and the effects of the
   artifact were examined for an aqueous CsCl solution sample. The results
   show that the beam-hardening artifact derived from the polychromatic
   photon energy distribution can be suppressed by applying a special image
   reconstruction method assuming the chemical composition of samples. The
   transient one-dimensional diffusion of heavy ions in a plastic container
   filled with the gel was imaged nondestructively by the Xray CT scanner
   with an in-plane resolution of 0.31 mm and slice thickness of 2 mm. The
   results show that diffusivities decrease with increasing clay weight
   fraction. The degree of the diffusivity decrease was high for cations
   (Cs+ and Srz(+)) and low for anions (I- and Br-). The quantitative
   decomposition of the contribution of the geometrical tortuosity and of
   the sorption to the diffusivity was performed by subtracting the
   diffusivity of nonsorbing I- from the measured diffusivities. The
   results show that the contribution of the sorption is large for Cs+,
   Srz(+) and small for Br-. Because X-ray CT allows nondestructive and
   quick measurements of diffusivities, the technique would be useful
   particularly for measuring the diffusive migration of harmful
   radioactive elements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Water-conducting faults and fractures were studied in the granite-hosted
   Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (SE Sweden). On a scale of decametres and
   larger, steeply dipping faults dominate and contain a variety of
   different fault rocks (mylonites, cataclasites, fault gouges). On a
   smaller scale, somewhat less regular fracture patterns were found.
   Conceptual models of the fault and fracture geometries and of the
   properties of rock types adjacent to fractures were derived and used as
   input for the modelling of in situ dipole tracer tests that were
   conducted in the framework of the Tracer Retention Understanding
   Experiment (TRUE-1) on a scale of metres. After the identification of
   all relevant transport and retardation processes, blind predictions of
   the breakthroughs of conservative to moderately sorbing tracers were
   calculated and then compared with the experimental data. This paper
   provides the geological basis and model calibration, while the
   predictive and inverse modelling work is the topic of the companion
   paper {[}J. Contam. Hydrol. 61 (2003) 175].
   The TRUE-1 experimental volume is highly fractured and contains the same
   types of fault rocks and alterations as on the decametric scale. The
   experimental flow field was modelled on the basis of a 2D-streamtube
   formalism with an underlying homogeneous and isotropic transmissivity
   field. Tracer transport was modelled using the dual porosity medium
   approach, which is linked to the flow model by the flow porosity. Given
   the substantial pumping rates in the extraction borehole, the transport
   domain has a maximum width of a few centimetres only. It is concluded
   that both the uncertainty with regard to the length of individual
   fractures and the detailed geometry of the network along the flowpath
   between injection and extraction boreholes are not critical because flow
   is largely one-dimensional, whether through a single fracture or a
   network. Process identification and model calibration were based on a
   single uranine breakthrough (test PDT3), which clearly showed that
   matrix diffusion had to be included in the model even over the short
   experimental time scales, evidenced by a characteristic shape of the
   trailing edge of the breakthrough curve. Using the geological
   information and therefore considering limited matrix diffusion into a
   thin fault gouge horizon resulted in a good fit to the experiment. On
   the other hand, fresh granite was found not to interact noticeably with
   the tracers over the time scales of the experiments.
   While fracture-filling gouge materials are very efficient in retarding
   tracers over short periods of time (hours-days), their volume is very
   small and, with time progressing, retardation will be dominated by
   altered wall rock and, finally, by fresh granite. In such rocks, both
   porosity (and therefore the effective diffusion coefficient) and
   sorption K(d)s are more than one order of magnitude smaller compared to
   fault gouge, thus indicating that long-term retardation is expected to
   occur but to be less pronounced. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Based on the results from detailed structural and petrological
   characterisation and on up-scaled laboratory values for sorption and
   diffusion, blind predictions were made for the STT1 dipole tracer test
   performed in the Swedish Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory. The tracers used
   were nonsorbing, such as uranine and tritiated water, weakly sorbing
   Na-22(+), Sr-85(2+), Ca-47(2+) and more strongly sorbing Rb-86(+)
   Ba-133(2+) Cs-137(+).
   Our model consists of two parts: (1) a flow part based on a
   2D-streamtube formalism accounting for the natural background flow field
   and with an underlying homogeneous and isotropic transmissivity field
   and (2) a transport part in terms of the dual porosity medium approach
   which is linked to the flow part by the flow porosity.
   The calibration of the model was done using the data from one single
   uranine breakthrough (PDT3). The study clearly showed that matrix
   diffusion into a highly porous material, fault gouge, had to be included
   in our model evidenced by the characteristic shape of the breakthrough
   curve and in line with geological observations.
   After the disclosure of the measurements, it turned out that, in spite
   of the simplicity of our model; the prediction for the nonsorbing and
   weakly sorbing tracers was fairly good. The blind prediction for the
   more strongly sorbing tracers was in general less accurate. The reason
   for the good predictions is deemed to be the result of the choice of a
   model structure strongly based on geological observation. The
   breakthrough curves were inversely modelled to determine in situ values
   for the transport parameters and to draw consequences on the model
   structure applied. For good fits, only one additional fracture family in
   contact with cataclasite had to be taken into account, but no new
   transport mechanisms had to be invoked. The in situ values for the
   effective diffusion coefficient for fault gouge are a factor of 2-15
   larger than the laboratory data. For cataclasite, both data sets have
   values comparable to laboratory data. The extracted K-d values for the
   weakly sorbing tracers are larger than Swedish laboratory data by a
   factor of 25-60, but agree within a factor of 3-5 for the more strongly
   sorbing nuclides. The reason for the inconsistency concerning K(d)s is
   the use of fresh granite in the laboratory studies, whereas tracers in
   the field experiments interact only with fracture fault gouge and to a
   lesser extent with cataclasite both being mineralogically very different
   (e.g. clay-bearing) from the intact wall rock. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A program of in situ experiments, supported by laboratory studies, was
   initiated to study diffusion in sparsely fractured rock (SFR), with a
   goal of developing an understanding of diffusion processes within intact
   crystalline rock. Phase I of the in situ diffusion experiment was
   started in 1996, with the purpose of developing a methodology for
   estimating diffusion parameter values. Four in situ diffusion
   experiments, using a conservative iodide tracer, were performed in
   highly stressed SFR at a depth of 450 m in the Underground Research
   Laboratory (URL). The experiments, performed over a 2 year period,
   yielded rock permeability estimates of 2 x 10(-21) m(2) and effective
   diffusion coefficients varying from 2.1 x 10(-14) to 1.9 x 10(-13)
   m(2)/s, which were estimated using the MOTIF code. The in situ diffusion
   profiles reveal a characteristic ``dog leg{''} pattern, with iodide
   concentrations decreasing rapidly within a centimeter of the open
   borehole wall. It is hypothesized that this is an artifact of local
   stress redistribution and creation of a zone of increased constrictivity
   close to the borehole wall. A comparison of estimated in situ and
   laboratory diffasivities and permeabilities provides evidence that the
   physical properties of rock samples removed from high-stress regimes
   change. As a result of the lessons learnt during Phase I, a Phase II in
   situ program has been initiated to improve our general understanding of
   diffusion in SFR. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A long-term single borehole diffusion experiment using tritiated water
   as tracer was carried out in Opalinus clay, an argillaceous rock
   formation that is accessible at the Mont Terri Underground Research
   Laboratory, situated in the Swiss Jura. The tracer was diluted in
   reconstituted formation water and introduced into a packed-off section
   of a borehole located in saturated rock. Pressure in this interval was
   maintained equal to the pore pressure of the surrounding rock in order
   to prevent any hydraulic gradient around the borehole and to avoid
   advective transport processes. The evolution of the tracer concentration
   in the injection system was monitored over time.
   After 1 year of diffusion, the claystone surrounding the interval was
   retrieved by overcoring the whole borehole and packer system, and by an
   adjacent oblique borehole. Compressed air was used as drilling fluid to
   reduce rock disturbances. The recovered overcore was sampled along
   profiles perpendicular to the borehole wall with a view to determining
   the tracer-concentration profiles in the rock. To avoid further
   evaporation of tritiated water, subsamples were immediately transferred
   into polyethylene bottles and disaggregated by adding a known amount of
   tracer-free water. Fifteen profiles were determined and showed a
   decreasing tracer concentration with distance into the rock. The
   pore-water contents were constant along those profiles, confirming that
   only very little water was lost during overcoring operations.
   The evolution of tritium-tracer concentration in the injection system
   over time and in situ profiles were interpreted with a 3-D numerical
   simulation of the experiment. That allowed for the identification of the
   transport parameters (orthotropic diffusion tensor and porosity) by
   minimising the relative quadratic error between the experimental and
   simulated data. The fitting is good and the results are consistent with
   data obtained on drill-core samples. The result of tritiated water is
   discussed regarding (1) the potential effect of mechanical and/or
   chemical disturbances around the injection borehole and (2) the specific
   behaviour of tritiated water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   currently being performed at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory (HRL) in
   Sweden. This paper covers laboratory and in situ investigations on
   actinide migration in single-fractured granite core samples. For the in
   situ experiment, the CHEMLAB 2 probe developed by SKB was used. The
   experimental setup as well as the breakthrough of inert tracers and of
   the actinides Am, Np and Pu are presented. The breakthrough curves of
   inert tracers were analyzed to determine hydraulic properties of the
   fractured samples. Postmortem analyses of the solid samples were
   performed to characterize the flow path and the sorbed actinides. After
   cutting the cores, the abraded material was analyzed with respect to
   sorbed actinides. The slices were scanned optically to visualize the
   flow path. Effective volumes and inner surface areas were measured.
   In the experiments, only breakthrough of Np(V) was observed. In each
   experiment, the recovery of Np(V) was less than or equal to40\%.
   Breakthrough of Am(III) and Pu(IV) as well as of Np(IV) was not

Abstract = {{The sites at Bangombe and Okelobondo (Oklo) in Gabon provide a unique
   opportunity to study the behaviour of products from natural nuclear
   reactions in the vicinity of reactor zones which were active around two
   billion years ago. The Commission of the European Communities initiated
   the Oklo Natural Analogue Programme. One of the principal aims was to
   study indications of present time migration of elements from the reactor
   zones under ambient conditions. The hydrogeological and hydrochemical
   data from the Oklo sites were modelled in order to better understand the
   geochemical behaviour of radionuclides in the natural system, by using
   independent models and by comparing the modelling outcome. Two modelling
   approaches were used: M3 code (hydrochemical mixing and mass balance
   model), developed by the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management
   Company (SKB) and HYTEC (reactive transport model) developed by Ecole
   des Mines de Paris.
   Two different reactor zones were studied: Bangombe, a shallow site, the
   reactor being at 11 m depth, and OK84 at Okelobondo, situated at about
   450 m depth, more comparable with a real repository location. This
   allowed the validation of modelling tools in two different sedimentary
   environments: one shallow, with a more homogeneous layering situated in
   an area of meteoric alteration, and the other offering the opportunity
   to study radionuclide migration from the reaction zone over a distance
   of 450 m through very heterogeneous sedimentary layers. The modeling
   results indicate that the chemical reactions retarding radionuclide
   transport are very different at the two sites. At Bangombe, the
   decomposition of organic material consumes oxygen and at Okelobondo the
   oxygen is consumed by inorganic reactions resulting, in both cases, in
   uranium retardation. Both modelling approaches (statistic with M3 code
   and deterministic with HYTEC code) could describe this situation.
   The goal of this exercise is to test codes which can help to describe
   and understand the processes taking place at the sites, validate the
   models with in situ data, and thus build confidence in the tools used
   for future site characterization. Ultimately, this allows identifying
   and selecting processes and parameters that can be used as input into
   repository performance assessment calculations and modelling exercises.

Abstract = {{The geochemical suitability of a deep bedrock repository for radioactive
   waste disposal is determined by the composition of geomatrix and
   groundwater. Both influence radionuclide solubility, chemical buffer
   capacity and radionuclide retention. They also determine the chemical
   compatibility of waste forms, containers and backfill materials.
   Evaluation of different groundwater-host rock systems is performed by
   modeling the geochemical environments and the resulting radionuclide
   concentrations. In order to demonstrate the evaluation method, model
   calculations are applied to data sets available for various geological
   formations such as granite, clay and rocksalt.
   The saturation state of the groundwater-geomatrix system is found to be
   fundamental for the evaluation process. Hence, calculations are
   performed to determine if groundwater is in equilibrium with mineral
   phases of the geological formation. In addition, corrosion of waste
   forms in different groundwater is examined by means of reaction path
   modeling. The corrosion reactions change the solution compositions and
   pH, resulting in significant changes of radionuclide solubilities. The
   results demonstrate that geochemical modeling of saturation state and
   compatibility of the host formation environment with the radioactive
   waste proves to be a feasible tool for evaluation of various sites
   considered as deep underground repositories. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper presents a digitized version of a thermodynamic sorption
   database, implemented as a relational database with MS Access. It is
   mineral-specific and can therefore be used for additive models of
   complex solid phases such as rocks or soils. An integrated user
   interface helps users to access selected mineral and sorption data, to
   extract internally consistent data sets for sorption modeling, and to
   export them in formats suitable for other modeling software. Data
   records comprise mineral properties, specific surface area values,
   surface binding sites' characteristics, sorption ligand information, and
   surface complexation reactions. An extensive bibliography is included,
   providing links not only to the above listed data, but also to
   background information concerning surface complexation model theories,
   evidence for surface species, and sorption experimental techniques. (C)

Abstract = {{The current way of describing diffusive transport through compacted
   clays is a simple diffusion model coupled to a linear adsorption
   coefficient (K-d). To fit the observed results of cation diffusion, this
   model is usually extended with an adjustable ``surface diffusion{''}
   coefficient. Description of the negative adsorption of anions calls for
   a further adjustment through the use of an ``effective porosity{''}. The
   final model thus includes many fitting parameters. This is inconvenient
   where predictive modeling is called for (e.g., for waste confinement
   using compacted clay liners).
   The diffusion/adsorption models in current use have been derived from
   the common hydrogeological equation of advection/dispersion/adsorption.
   However, certain simplifications were also borrowed without questioning
   their applicability to the case of compacted clays. Among these
   simplifications, the assumption that the volume of the adsorbed phase is
   negligible should be discussed. We propose a modified
   diffusion/adsorption model that accounts for the volume of the adsorbed
   phase. It suggests that diffusion through highly compacted clay takes
   place through the interlayers (i.e., in the adsorbed phase).
   Quantitative prediction of the diffusive flux will necessitate more
   detailed descriptions of surface reactivity and of the mobility of
   interlayer species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Oxidative dissolution of uranium dioxide (UO2) and the subsequent
   migration of uranium in a subsurface environment and an underground
   waste disposal have been simulated with reactive transport models. In
   these systems, hydrogeological and chemical processes are closely

   with respect to redox reactions, kinetics of mineralogical evolution and
   hydrodynamic migration of species of interest.
   Different codes, where among CASTEM, CHEMTRAP and HYTEC, have been used
   as an intercomparison and verification exercise. Although the agreement
   between codes is satisfactory, it is shown that the discretization
   method of the transport equation (i.e. finite elements (FE) versus
   mixed-hybrid FE and finite differences) and the sequential coupling
   scheme may lead to systematic discrepancies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

   considers the interaction of compacted bentonite with a fresh-type
   groundwater; variations include the presence of bentonite impurities and
   saline groundwater. It is shown that these scenarios result in
   significant variations of porewater composition that affect migration
   via three mechanisms that can partly compensate each other: (1) effects
   on sorption through radionuclide complexation in solution, and
   competition of major cations for surface sites; (2) changes in
   radionuclide solution speciation leading to different diffusing species
   under different conditions; (3) effects on diffusion through changes in
   the electric double layer properties of the clay pores as a function of
   ionic strength. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bentonites of various types are being investigated in many countries as
   backfill materials in high-level radioactive waste disposal concepts.
   Being able to understand the chemistry of the porewater in compacted
   bentonite is very important since it is critical to predicting
   radionuclide solubilities and to the synthesis of sorption data bases,
   and hence to repository safety studies. In this paper, porewater
   compositions in compacted bentonites are calculated, taking into
   consideration such factors as montmorillonite swelling, semi-permeable
   membrane effects, very low ``free water{''} volumes, and the highly
   effective buffering characteristics of the exchangeable cations and the
   amphoteric edge sites. The former buffer the cation concentrations and
   the latter fix the pH in the porewater of a resaturated bentonite. The
   above considerations are used in conjunction with previously measured
   physico-chemical characterisation data on MX-80 powder to calculate
   porewater compositions in compacted bentonites. For the MX-80 material
   specified, the porewaters calculated for initial dry densities between
   1200 and 1600 kg m(-3) had relatively high ionic strengths (I similar to
   0.3 M), similar cation concentrations and a pH equal to 8.0. The
   porewaters changed from being Na2SO4-rich at 1200 kg m(-3) to a
   NaCl/Na2SO4 type water at 1600 kg m(-3). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Matrix diffusion in saturated rocks with very low permeability is one of
   the major mechanisms of solute transport. Laboratory out-diffusion
   experiments on rock samples may provide an estimate of the bulk
   diffusion coefficient. However, numerous results have shown that this
   average parameter does not really depict the complex mechanism of
   diffusion as a function of the internal heterogeneity of crystalline
   rocks. Two-dimensional images of the porosity distribution in a granite
   sample were obtained by impregnation with a radioactive resin and
   autoradiography. Some examples based on these images and synthetic
   images were used to perform numerical simulations of out-diffusion using
   two different random walk methods. The simulated shapes of the
   out-diffusion curves depend on the spatial distribution of the porosity
   and on the pore connectivity with the border of the sample. Such
   relations might explain the multiple nested slopes or the convex shapes
   often observed on real experimental curves. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Some recent converging tracer tests with sorbing tracers at the Aspo
   Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden, the TRUE tests, have been predicted
   using only laboratory data and hydraulic data from borehole
   measurements. No model parameters were adjusted to obtain a better fit
   with the experiments. The independent data were fracture frequency and
   transmissivity data obtained in the field and laboratory data on
   sorption and matrix diffusion.
   Transmissivity measurements in five boreholes in the rock volume
   containing the region surrounding the injection and collection points
   show that there is a high frequency of water conducting fractures. Of
   162 packed off sections with 0.5 m packer distances, 112 were found to
   have a transmissivity above the detection limit. The specific
   flow-wetted surface (FWS) of the rock mass could be estimated from these
   data. The transmissivities were found to be reasonably well described by
   a lognormal distribution. Laboratory data on diffusion and sorption
   properties together with the hydraulic data were used to ``predict{''}
   the residence time distribution (RTD) of the sorbing tracers. The
   results were compared with the experimental breakthrough curves.
   In these experiments, the water residence time is very small compared to
   the residence time of the sorbing tracers due to their diffusion and
   sorption within the rock matrix. We thus could neglect the influence of
   the water residence time in our predictions. Therefore, no information
   on water residence times or on ``dispersion{''} was needed. The
   dispersion of the sorbing tracers is caused by the different sorbing
   tracer residence times in different pathways. The sorbing tracer
   residence time is determined by the ratio of flowrate to the flow-wetted
   surface in the different pathways and not by the water residence time.
   Assuming a three-dimensional flow pattern and using the observed
   fracture frequency and flowrate distribution, breakthrough curves for
   three strongly sorbing tracers were predicted. Only the laboratory data,
   the transmissivity measurements and the pumping flowrate were used in
   the predictions. No information on the water residence time as obtained
   by the nonsorbing tracers was used. The predictions were surprisingly
   accurate. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion and sorption in the rock matrix are important retardation
   mechanisms for radionuclide transport in fractured media. For the
   conditions existing in a deep repository in crystalline rock,
   interaction with the rock matrix is controlled by the water flowrate in
   the fractures and the surface area in contact with the flowing water
   (the so-called ``flow-wetted surface{''} (FWS)). The flow-wetted surface
   may be determined from the frequency of open fractures intersecting a
   borehole. The choice of packer distance used in these hydraulic
   measurements is crucial, however, since several open fractures may be
   found in one packer interval. The use of a packer distance that is too
   large may result in a considerable underestimation of the flow-wetted
   surface. This is especially important in zones with a high frequency of
   open fractures (fracture zones) where a small packer distance is a
   fundamental requirement.
   A large volume of hydraulic data has been compiled in Sweden from
   measurements using quite small packer distances. Over the last decade,
   the most common packer distance used for the hydraulic tests has been 3
   m, although some new measurements using a shorter packer distance have
   also been performed. In several cases, the resolution of these
   measurements has been less than 0.5 m. All these data have been analysed
   in detail. From these data, the flow-wetted surface has been calculated
   and compared with the flow-wetted surface estimated in earlier studies.
   The results show the importance of using a small packer distance for
   carrying out borehole transmissivity measurements. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We performed a sensibility analysis of model selection in modeling the
   reactive transport of cesium in crushed granite through model
   calibration and validation. Based on some solid phase analysis data and
   kinetic batch experimental results, we hypothesized three two-site
   sorption models in the LEHGC reactive transport model to fit the
   breakthrough curves (BTCs) from the corresponding column experiments.
   The analysis of breakthrough curves shows that both the empirical
   two-site kinetic linear sorption model and the
   semi-mechanistic/semi-empirical two-site kinetic surface complexation
   model, regardless of their complexity, can match our experimental data
   fairly well under given test conditions. A numerical experiment to
   further compare the two models shows that they behave differently when
   the pore velocity is not of the same order of magnitude as our test
   velocities. This result indicates that further investigations to help
   determine a better model are needed. We suggest that a multistage column
   experiment, which tests over the whole range of practical flow
   velocities, should be conducted to help alleviate inadequate

Abstract = {{The investigation of the migration of a high pH plume in a fractured
   shear zone is foreseen by a long-term experiment at the Grimsel rock
   laboratory. In order to characterise the initial conditions for the
   long-term experiment and to evaluate an optimal hydraulic in situ
   set-up, several dipole experiments with nonreacting tracers have been
   performed. The dipole experiments differ in geometry, pumping rates and
   orientation to the background water flow. Several single and
   double-porosity models have been applied to fit the results of these
   dipole tracer tests in order to extract values for some transport
   parameters and discriminate for certain transport processes. A
   two-dimensional porous medium approach was successfully used to fit
   tracer breakthrough curves measured for a dipole experiment. A model
   based on a one-dimensional dual porous medium approach was also
   successful, although the applied hydraulic dipole, with similar
   injection and extraction rates, suggests the existence of an extended
   two-dimensional flow field. For the two-dimensional porous medium
   approach, tracer breakthrough could only be fitted with a complex flow
   field geometry within the heterogeneous fractured shear zone. The
   heterogeneity was generated by heterogeneous porosity and hydraulic
   permeability distributions. Predictions for further dipole geometries
   and a sorbing tracer have been calculated by means of both models using
   the flow and transport parameters deduced from fits for a single dipole
   experiment. This allows for comparison with the measured breakthrough of
   sorbing tracers. The foreseen experiment with sorbing (radionuclide)
   tracers will help decide on the appropriate approach that should be used
   to describe such dipole experiments in this shear zone. Additionally,
   the migration and spreading of a solution with high pH has been
   calculated taking into account mineral dissolution and precipitation in
   a two-dimensional porous medium approach in order to estimate the amount
   and character of the mineral reactions induced by the interaction
   between the high pH solution and the rock. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The description of the geochemical properties of the bentonite backfill
   that serves as engineered barrier for nuclear repositories is a central
   issue for performance assessment since these play a large role in
   determining the fate of contaminants released from the waste. In this
   study the porewater chemistry of bentonite was assessed with a
   thermodynamic modelling approach that includes ion exchange, surface
   complexation and mineral equilibrium reactions. The focus was to
   identify the geochemical reactions controlling the major ion chemistry
   and acid-base properties and to explore parameter uncertainties
   specifically at high compaction degrees. First, the adequacy of the
   approach was tested with two distinct surface complexation models by
   describing recent experimental data performed at highly varying
   solid/liquid ratios and ionic strengths. The results indicate adequate
   prediction of the entire experimental data set. Second, the modelling
   was extended to repository conditions, taking as an example the current
   Swiss concept for high-level waste where the compacted bentonite
   backfill is surrounded by argillaceous rock. The main reactions
   controlling major ion chemistry were found to be calcite equilibrium and
   concurrent Na-Ca exchange reactions and deprotonation of functional
   surface groups. Third, a sensitivity analysis of the main model
   parameters was performed. The results thereof indicate a remarkable
   robustness of the model with regard to parameter uncertainties. The
   bentonite system is characterised by a large acid-base buffering
   capacity which leads to stable pH-conditions. The uncertainty in pH was
   found to be mainly induced by the pCO(2) of the surrounding host rock.
   The results of a simple diffusion-reaction model indicate only minor
   changes of porewater composition with time, which is primarily due to
   the geochemical similarities of the bentonite and the argillaceous host
   rock.
   Overall, the results show the usefulness of simple thermodynamic models
   to describe porewater chemistry of expandable clays although significant
   uncertainties with regard to the effects of swelling and
   physico-chemical properties of the interstitial water remain. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical model to describe pulse injection
   experiments. This model solves the advection-diffusion equation while
   taking into account back diffusion from the clay core to the inlet and
   from the outlet to the clay core. In most analytical models, back
   diffusion is neglected. For sufficiently high Peclet numbers, this is a
   good approximation. However, in experiments where the Peclet number is
   low, back diffusion is important and must be taken into account. An
   additional advantage of the present model is that both concentration and
   flux are conserved at the inlet and at the outlet of the clay core.
   This model is used to fit pulse injection experiments with iodide and
   tritiated water (HTO) in clay cores. The (new) model is required for
   fitting the experimental results since in clay layers advection is very
   slow leading to a low Peclet number. The experiments are performed on
   clay cores taken from different depths from the Boom Clay and the Ypres
   Clay layer under the site of the nuclear power plant of Doel (Belgium).
   The quality of all fits is excellent and the obtained parameter values
   are coherent. For HTO, the fitted value for the diffusion accessible
   porosity is consistent with measurements of the water content in Ypres
   Clay cores. In both types of clays, the apparent diffusion coefficient
   at zero flow is between 10(-10) and 2 x 10(-10) m(2)/s for iodide and
   between 2 x 10(-10) and 3 x 10(-10) to m(2)/s for HTO. The dispersion
   length is in the order of 10(-3) m. The average value for the diffusion
   accessible porosity is between 0.35 and 0.4 for HTO and between 0.2 and
   0.25 for iodide. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Barometric pressure changes can induce airflow in an open borehole or
   well screened in the vadose zone, thereby ventilating the soil
   surrounding the borehole. This paper presents an analytic model of the
   induced airflow and compares the predictions of the model with
   experimental measurements. This model may be useful for the design of
   passive soil vapor extraction as applied to the remediation of soil
   contaminated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Based on harmonic
   analysis, the model predicts the time-dependent flow in agreement with
   measurements at a borehole in strata of differing permeability. The
   model uses no adjustable parameters, but proceeds from first principles
   based upon known or estimated values of soil properties as a function of
   depth. In an approximation, the calculated flow is determined by the
   difference between barometric pressure and the attenuated pressure that
   would propagate vertically into the vadose zone in the absence of an
   open borehole. The attenuated vertical propagation of pressure can be
   calculated by a corresponding harmonic method presented previously. The
   model reveals that the flow in the borehole is approximately
   proportional to the horizontal permeability in the formation, and
   depends only weakly on the soil porosity and borehole radius. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Field data of physical properties in heterogeneous crystalline bedrock,
   like porosity and fracture aperture, is associated with uncertainty that
   can have a significant impact on the analysis of solute transport in
   rock fractures. Solutions to the central temporal moments of the
   residence time probability density function (PDF) are derived in a
   closed form for a solute Dirac pulse. The solutions are based on a model
   that takes into account advection along the fracture plane, diffusion
   into the rock matrix and sorption kinetics in the rock matrix. The most
   relevant rock properties including fracture aperture and several matrix
   properties as well as flow velocity are assumed to be spatially random
   along transport pathways. The mass transport is first solved in a
   general form along one-dimensional pathways, but the results can be
   extended to multi-dimensional flows simply by substituting the expected
   travel time for inert water parcels. Based on data obtained with rock
   samples taken at Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory in Sweden, the solutions
   indicate that the heterogeneity of the rock properties contributes to
   increasing significantly both the variance and the skewness of the
   residence time probability density function for a pulse travelling in a
   fracture. The Aspo data suggests that the bias introduced in the
   variance of the residence time PDF by neglecting the effect of
   heterogeneity of the rock properties on the radionuclide migration is
   very large for fractures thinner than a few tenths of a millimetre. (C)

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the factors that influence the fate and transport of
   viruses in porous media is very important for accurately determining
   groundwater vulnerability and for developing protective regulations. In
   this study, six saturated sand column experiments were performed to
   examine the effects of a positively charged Al-oxide, which was coated
   on sand particles, on the retention and transport of viruses (phiX174
   and MS-2) in background solutions of different ionic strength and
   composition. We found that the Al-oxide coating on sand significantly
   removed viruses during their transport in a phosphate buffered saline
   (PBS) solution. Mass balance calculations showed that 34\% of the input
   MS-2 was inactivated/irreversibly sorbed on the surface of Al-oxide
   coated sand whereas 100\% of phiX174 was recovered. Results from this
   study also indicated that higher ionic strength facilitated the
   transport of both phiX174 and MS-2 through the Al-oxide coated sand.
   This was attributed to the effect of ion shielding, which at higher
   ionic strength decreased the electrostatic attraction between the viral
   particles and the sand surface and consequently decreased virus
   sorption. Strong effect of the ionic strength indicates that an
   outer-sphere complexation mechanism was responsible for the virus
   sorption on the Al-oxide coated sand. Ion composition of the background
   solutions was also found to be a significant factor in influencing virus
   retention and transport. Virus transport was enhanced in the presence of
   phosphate (HPO42-) as compared to bicarbonate (HCO3-), and the effect of
   HPO42- was more significant on MS-2 than on phiX174. The presence of
   bivalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) increased virus transport because the
   cations partially screened the negative charges on the viruses therefore
   decreased the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged
   sand surface and the negatively charged viruses. Mass recovery data
   indicated that bivalent cations gave rise to a certain degree of
   inactivation/irreversibly sorption of phiX174 on the surface of Al-oxide
   coated sand. On the contrary, the bivalent cations appeared to have
   protected MS-2 from inactivation/irreversibly sorption. This study
   provides some insights into the mechanisms responsible for virus
   retention and transport in porous media. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Stable hydrogen isotopes of two chlorinated solvents, trichloroethylene
   (TCE) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), provided by five different
   manufacturers, were determined and compared to their carbon and chlorine
   isotopic signatures. The isotope ratio for delta(2)H of different TCEs
   ranged between + 466.9parts per thousand and + 681.9parts per thousand,
   for delta(13)C between - 31.57parts per thousand and - 27.37parts per
   thousand, and for delta(37)Cl between -3.19parts per thousand and
   +3.90parts per thousand. In the case of the TCAs, the isotope ratio for
   delta(2)H ranged between - 23.1parts per thousand and + 15.1parts per
   thousand, for delta(13)C between - 27.39parts per thousand and -
   25.84parts per thousand, and for delta(37)Cl between - 3.54parts per
   thousand and + 1.39parts per thousand. As well, a column experiment was
   carried out to dechlorinate tetrachloroethylene (PCE) to TCE using iron.
   The dechlorination products have completely different hydrogen isotope
   ratios than the manufactured TCEs. Compared to the positive values of
   delta(2)H in manufactured TCEs (between + 466.9parts per thousand and +
   681.9parts per thousand), the dechlorinated products had a very depleted
   delta(2)H (less than - 300parts per thousand). This finding has strong
   implications for distinguishing dechlorination products (PCE to TCE)
   from manufactured TCE. In addition, the results of this study show the
   potential of combining H-2/H-1 analyses with C-13/C-12 and Cl-37/Cl-35
   for isotopic fingerprinting applications in organic contaminant
   hydrogeology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mainly due to intrinsic biodegradation, monitored natural attenuation
   can be an effective and inexpensive remediation strategy at petroleum
   release sites. However, gasoline additives such as methyl tert-butyl
   ether (MTBE) can jeopardize this strategy because these compounds often
   degrade, if at all, at a slower rate than the collectively benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene and the xylene (BTEX) compounds. Investigation of
   whether a compound degrades under certain conditions, and at what rate,
   is therefore important to the assessment of the intrinsic remediation
   potential of aquifers. A natural gradient experiment with dissolved
   MTBE-containing gasoline in the shallow, aerobic sand aquifer at
   Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Borden (Ontario, Canada) from 1988 to 1996
   suggested that biodegradation was the main cause of attenuation for MTBE
   within the aquifer. This laboratory study demonstrates biologically
   catalyzed MTBE degradation in Borden aquifer-like environments, and so
   supports the idea that attenuation due to biodegradation may have
   occurred in the natural gradient experiment. In an experiment with batch
   microcosms of aquifer material, three of the microcosms ultimately
   degraded MTBE to below detection, although this required more than 189
   days (or >300 days in one case). Failure to detect the daughter product
   tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) in the field and the batch experiments could be
   because TBA was more readily degradable than MTBE under Borden
   conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is actively investigating the
   technical feasibility of permanent disposal of high-level nuclear waste
   in a repository to be situated in the unsaturated zone (UZ) at Yucca
   Mountain (YM), Nevada. In this study we investigate, by means of
   numerical simulation, the transport of radioactive colloids under
   ambient conditions from the potential repository horizon to the water
   table. The site hydrology and the effects of the spatial distribution of
   hydraulic and transport properties in the Yucca Mountain subsurface are
   considered. The study of migration and retardation of colloids accounts
   for the complex processes in the unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain, and
   includes advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, kinetic colloid
   filtration, colloid straining, and radioactive decay. The results of the
   study indicate that the most important factors affecting colloid
   transport are the subsurface geology and site hydrology, i.e., the
   presence of faults (they dominate and control transport), fractures (the
   main migration pathways), and the relative distribution of zeolitic and
   vitric tuffs. The transport of colloids is strongly influenced by their
   size (as it affects diffusion into the matrix, straining at
   hydrogeologic unit interfaces, and transport velocity) and by the
   parameters of the kinetic-filtration model used for the simulations.
   Arrival times at the water table decrease with an increasing colloid
   size because of smaller diffusion, increased straining, and higher
   transport velocities. The importance of diffusion as a retardation
   mechanism increases with a decreasing colloid size, but appears to be
   minimal in large colloids. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ bio-remediation is a viable cleanup alternative for aquifers
   contaminated by hydrocarbons such as BTEX. Transport models of varying
   complexity and capabilities are used to quantify their degradation. A
   model that has gained wide acceptance in applications is BIOPLUME II,
   which assumes that oxygen-limited biodegradation takes place as an
   instantaneous reaction. In this work we have employed theoretical
   analysis, using non-dimensional variables, and numerical modelling to
   establish a quantitative criterion demarcating the range of validity of
   the instantaneous reaction approximation against biodegradation
   kinetics. Oxygen was the limiting species and sorption was ignored. This
   criterion relates {[}Da]\textbackslash{}(o), the Dahmkohler number at
   oxygen depletion, to O-o{*}, the ratio of initial to input oxygen
   concentration, {[}Da]\textbackslash{}(o) greater than or equal
   to0.7(O-o{*})(2)+0.1O(o){*} + 1.8. The derived {[}Da]\textbackslash{}(o)
   reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the physical transport and of
   the biochemical reaction, including the effect of biomass density.
   Relative availability of oxygen and hydrocarbons exerts a small
   influence on results. Theory, verified and refined via numerical
   simulations, showed that significant deviations of instantaneous
   reactions from kinetics are to be expected in the space-time region
   s<L-d, t<T-d ('near source' and `initial period'). Under the assumptions
   considered, numerical simulations also verified the wide applicability
   of the computationally efficient, stoichiometry-based (algebraic)
   BIOPLUME concept. Kinetic modelling is required only in active
   (engineered) bio-remediation cases, with high velocities (e.g., near
   pumped wells), and for short distances from the source. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In order to contain the movement of organic contaminants in groundwater,
   a subsurface sorption barrier consisting of sand or clay minerals coated
   with a cationic surfactant has been proposed. The effectiveness of such
   a sorption barrier might be affected by the presence of dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) in the groundwater. To study the impact of DOM on
   barrier performance, a series of batch experiments were,performed by
   measuring naphthalene and phenanthrene sorption onto sand coated with
   cetylpyridinium. chloride (CPC) and bentonite coated with
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA) in the presence of various
   concentrations of DOM. The overall soilwater distribution coefficient
   (K{*}) of naphthalene and phenanthrene onto CPC-coated sand decreased
   with increasing DOM concentration, whereas the K{*} of the compounds
   onto HDTMA-coated bentonite slightly increased with increasing DOM
   concentration. To describe the overall distribution of polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the systems, a competitive multiphase
   sorption (CMS) model was developed and compared with an overall
   mechanistic sorption (OMS) model. The modeling studies showed that while
   the OMS model did not explain the CPC-coated sand experimental results,
   a model that included competitive sorption between DOM and PAH did. The
   experimental results and the modeling study indicated that there was no
   apparent competition between DOM and PAH in the HDTMA-coated bentonite
   system, and indicated that in groundwater systems with high DOM, a
   barrier using HDTMA-coated bentonite might be more effective. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The heterogeneity of hydrogeologic properties at different scales may
   have different effects on flow and transport processes in a subsurface
   system. A model for the unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is
   developed to represent complex heterogeneity at two different scales:
   (1) layer scale corresponding to geologic layering and (2) local scale.
   The layer-scale hydrogeologic proper-ties are obtained using inverse
   modeling, based on the available measurements collected from the Yucca
   Mountain site. Calibration results show a significant lateral and
   vertical variability in matrix and fracture properties. Hydrogeologic
   property distributions in a two-dimensional, vertical cross-section of
   the site are generated by combining the average layer-scale matrix and
   fracture properties with local-scale perturbations generated using a
   stochastic simulation method. The unsaturated water flow and
   conservative (nonsorbing) tracer transport through the cross-section are
   simulated for different sets of matrix and fracture property fields.
   Comparison of simulation results indicates that the local-scale
   heterogeneity of matrix and fracture properties has a considerable
   effect on unsaturated flow processes, leading to fast flow paths in
   fractures and the matrix. These paths shorten the travel time of a
   conservative tracer from the source (repository) horizon in the
   unsaturated zone to the water table for small fractions of total
   released tracer mass. As a result, the local-scale heterogeneity also
   has a noticeable effect on global tracer transport processes,
   characterized by an average breakthrough curve at the water table,
   especially at the early arrival time of tracer mass. However, the effect
   is not significant at the later time after 20\% tracer mass reaches the
   water table. The simulation results also verify that matrix diffusion
   plays an important role in overall solute transport processes in the
   unsaturated zone at Yucca Mountain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A large-scale experiment was conducted to investigate the transport of
   trichloroethylene (TCE) vapors in the unsaturated zone and to determine
   the mass transfer to the. groundwater and the atmosphere. The experiment
   involved injection of 5 1 of WE in the unsaturated zone under controlled
   conditions, with multidepth sampling of gas and water through the
   unsaturated zone and across the capillary zone into underlying
   groundwater. The mass transfer of TCE vapors from the vadose zone to the
   atmosphere was quantified using a vertical flux chamber. A special soil
   water sampler was used to monitor transport across the capillary fringe.
   Experimental data indicated that WE in the unsaturated zone was mainly
   transported to the atmosphere and this exchange reduced significantly
   the potential for groundwater pollution. The maximum measured TCE flux
   to the atmosphere was about 3 g/m(2)/day. Observed and calculated fluxes
   based on vertical WE vapor concentration gradients and Fick's law were
   in good agreement. This confirms that TCE vapor transport under the
   experimental conditions was governed essentially by molecular diffusion.
   TCE vapors also caused a lower, but significant contamination of the
   underlying groundwater by dispersion across the capillary fringe with a
   corresponding maximum flux of about 0.1 g/m(2)/day. This mass transfer
   to groundwater is partly uncertain due to an inadvertent entry of some
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) from the source area into the saturated
   zone. Application of an analytical solution to estimate the TCE flux
   from the unsaturated zone to the groundwater indicated that this
   phenomenon is not only influenced by molecular diffusion but also by
   vertical dispersion. The mass balance indicates that, under the given
   experimental conditions (e.g. proximity of the. source emplacement
   relative to the soil surface, relatively high permeable porous medium),
   nearly 95\% of the initial TCE mass was transferred to the atmosphere.

Abstract = {{Surfactant-enhanced aquifer remediation (SEAR) involves the injection of
   surfactant solutions into aquifers contaminated with nonaqueous phase
   liquids (NAPL). Batch and column experiments were used to assess the
   effect of surfactant formulation on the rate of NAPL solubilization. The
   experimental variables were surfactant type, surfactant concentration,
   electrolyte concentration, and cosolvent concentration. Model equations
   were proposed and solved to describe solubilization under the conditions
   of each type of experiment. Using these models, a solubilization rate
   constant, k(b), and an overall mass transfer rate coefficient, k, were
   estimated from the batch and column experiments, respectively. The
   solubilization rate constant was consistently sensitive to surfactant
   type, surfactant concentration, and electrolyte concentration. The
   estimated solubilization rate constants varied over two orders of
   magnitude. The results of the column experiments also were sensitive to
   the surfactant formulation. Variations in the fitted mass transfer rate
   coefficient parameter, beta(0), were related to variations in the
   surfactant formulations. A comparison between the results of the batch
   and column experiments yields an apparent relationship between beta(0)
   and k(b). This relationship suggests that the mass transfer rate
   coefficient is directly related to the formulation of the surfactant
   solution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology to study the trichloroethylene (TCE) and dodecane removal
   in porous media by surfactant foams (SF) was presented by using
   etched-glass micromodels. The purpose of this work was to systematically
   evaluate the impact of various physicochemical factors such as gas
   fraction (GF), surfactant concentration, pore structure and nonaqueous
   phase liquid (NAPL) types on NAPL removal during SF flooding. The TCE
   displacement by SF was dependent on the gas fraction of SF. Low GFs
   (50\% and 66\%) were more efficient for TCE removal and sweep
   efficiencies than a high GF (85\%). An increase in TCE removal was
   observed with increasing surfactant concentration at a fixed GF. TCE
   removal by SF flooding appeared to be dependent more to the value of
   Capillary number rather than to the concentration of surfactant
   solution. The effect of the pore heterogeneity was evaluated by
   employing two different types of micromodels. The Capillary number is an
   important parameter in the determination of sweep efficiency or gas
   saturation of SF in a nonhomogeneous porous medium. However, the TCE
   removal from a nonhomogeneous porous medium may not be associated with
   sweep efficiency. The initial configuration of residual TCE blobs in a
   nonhomogeneous porous medium would also be influential in displacing
   TCE. Sweep efficiencies and pressure responses of two NAPL systems (TCE
   and dodecane) were monitored to evaluate foam stability when the foam
   contacts the NAPLs. Stable foam contacting with TCE is implied, while it
   appears that dodecane cause the SF to collapse. All results indicate
   that the Capillary number (a ratio of viscous forces to capillary
   forces) is the most important parameter for TCE removal by SF flooding.
   Micromodel visualizations of water, surfactant and SF floods were showed
   and also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{At many ``real world{''} field sites, the number of available monitoring
   wells is limited due to economic or geological reasons. Under such
   restricted conditions, it is difficult to perform a reliable field
   investigation and to quantify primary lines of evidence for natural
   attenuation (NA), like the documentation of a decrease of contaminant
   mass flux in flow direction. This study reports the results of a
   groundwater investigation at a former manufactured gas plant situated in
   a Quaternary river valley in southwest Germany. The location,
   infrastructure and aquifer setting are typical of many industrial sites
   in Germany. Due to difficult drilling conditions (coarse glaciofluvial
   gravel deposits and an anthropogenic fill above the aquifer), only 12
   monitoring wells were available for the investigation and localisation
   of the contaminant plume. These wells were situated along three control
   planes (CP) downgradient from the contaminant source, with four wells
   along each plane. Based on the sparse set of monitoring wells, field
   scale mass fluxes and first-order natural attenuation rate constants of
   benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and o-xylene and p-xylene (BTEX) and low
   molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were estimated
   utilizing different point scale and also a new integral investigation
   method. The results show that even at a heterogeneous site with a sparse
   monitoring network point scale investigation methods can provide
   reliable information on field scale natural attenuation rates, if a
   dependable flow model or tracer test data is available. If this
   information is not available, only the new integral investigation method
   presented can yield adequate results for the quantification of
   contaminant mass fluxes under sparse monitoring conditions. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{In this note, we applied the temporal moment solutions of {[}Das and
   Kluitenberg, 1996. Soil Sci. Am. J. 60, 1724] for one-dimensional
   advective-dispersive solute transport with linear equilibrium sorption
   and first-order degradation for time pulse sources to analyse soil
   column experimental data. Unlike most other moment solutions, these
   solutions consider the interplay of degradation and sorption. This
   permits estimation of a first-order degradation rate constant using the
   zeroth moment of column breakthrough data, as well as estimation of the
   retardation factor or sorption distribution coefficient of a degrading
   solute using the first moment. The method of temporal moment (MOM)
   formulae was applied to analyse breakthrough data from a laboratory
   column study of atrazine, hexazinone and rhodamine WT transport in
   volcanic pumice sand, as well as experimental data from the literature.
   Transport and degradation parameters obtained using the MOM were
   compared to parameters obtained by fitting breakthrough data from an
   advective-dispersive transport model with equilibrium sorption and
   first-order degradation, using the nonlinear least-square curve-fitting
   program CXTFIT. The results derived from using the literature data were
   also compared with estimates reported in the literature using different
   equilibrium models. The good agreement suggests that the MOM could
   provide an additional useful means of parameter estimation for transport
   involving equilibrium sorption and first-order degradation. We found
   that the MOM fitted breakthrough curves with tailing better than curve
   fitting. However, the MOM analysis requires complete breakthrough curves
   and relatively frequent data collection to ensure the accuracy of the
   moments obtained from the breakthrough data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Mixtures of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) trapped in the
   subsurface can act as long-term sources of contamination by dissolving
   into flowing groundwater. If the components have different solubilities
   then dissolution will alter the composition of the remaining DNAPL. We
   theorized that a multicomponent DNAPL pool may become mobile due to the
   natural dissolution process. In this study, we focused on two scenarios:
   (1) a DNAPL losing light component(s), with the potential for downward
   migration; and (2) a DNAPL losing dense component(s), with the potential
   for upward migration following transformation into a less dense than
   water nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL). We considered three binary
   mixtures of common groundwater contaminants: benzene and
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE), PCE and dichloromethane (DCM), and DCM and
   toluene. A number of physical properties that control the retention and
   transport of DNAPL in porous media were measured for the mixtures,
   namely: density, interfacial tension, effective solubility, and
   viscosity. All properties except density exhibited nonlinear
   relationships with changing molar ratio of the DNAPL. To illustrate the
   potential for natural remobilization, we modelled the following two
   primary mechanisms: the reduction in pool height as mass is lost by
   dissolution, and the changes in fluid properties with changing molar
   ratio of the DNAPL. The first mechanism always reduces the capillary
   pressure in the pool, while the second mechanism may increase the
   capillary pressure or alter the direction of the driving force. The
   difference between the rate of change of each determines whether the
   potential for remobilization increases or decreases. Static conditions
   and horizontal layering were assumed along with a one-dimensional,
   compositional modelling approach. Our results indicated that for initial
   benzene/PCE ratios greater than 25:75, the change in density was
   sufficiently faster than the decline in pool height to promote DNAPL
   breakthrough into the adjacent porous medium. In contrast, there was no
   potential for natural remobilization of a PCE-DCM mixture, primarily
   because the densities of the components are not sufficiently different.
   Dissolution of a DCM-toluene mixture decreased the density, reducing the
   tendency for downward displacement. However, the ultimate transformation
   from a DNAPL to an LNAPL may induce upward displacement. These results
   suggest that at sites with DNAPL pools containing a mix of components of
   sufficiently different densities and relative solubilities, natural
   remobilization may be an active mechanism, with implications for site
   evaluation and remediation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The partitioning tracer technique for dense nonaqueous phase liquid
   (DNAPL) characterization was evaluated in an isolated test cell, in
   which controlled releases of perchloroethylene (PCE) had occurred. Four
   partitioning tracer tests were conducted, two using an inverted, double
   five-spot pumping pattern, and two using vertical circulation wells. Two
   of the four tests were conducted prior to remedial activities, and two
   were conducted after. Each test was conducted as a ``blind test{''}
   where researchers conducting the partitioning tracer tests had no
   knowledge of the volume, method of release, nor resulting spatial
   distribution of DNAPL. Multiple partitioning tracers were used in each
   test, and the DNAPL volume estimates varied significantly within each
   test based on the different partitioning tracers. The tracers with large
   partitioning coefficients generally predicted a smaller volume of PCE
   than that expected based on the actual release volume. However, these
   predictions were made for low DNAPL saturations (average saturation was
   approximately 0.003), under conditions near the limits of the method's
   application. Furthermore, there were several factors that may have
   hindered prediction accuracy, including tracer degradation and remedial
   fluid interference. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional chamber studies were conducted to determine qualitative
   and quantitative performance of cosolvents targeted at pooled dense
   non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) (perchlorethylene, PCE) residing above
   a fine-grain capillary barrier. Downward mobilization of DNAPL, up
   gradient along an overriding cosolvent front, was observed. This
   produced significant pooling above a fine-grain layer that in some cases
   lead to entry into the capillary barrier beneath. Entry pressure
   calculations using physical and hydrogeologic parameters provided an
   excellent prediction of breakthrough of DNAPL into the capillary
   barrier. Calculations predict approximately 0.5 m of DNAPL would be
   necessary to enter a Beit Netofa clay, under extreme cosolvent flooding
   conditions (100\% ethanol). Gradient injection of cosolvent did not
   appear to provide any benefit suggesting a rapid decrease in interfacial
   tension (IFT) compared to the rate of DNAPL solubilization. Use of a
   partitioning alcohol (tertiary butyl alcohol, TBA) resulted in DNAPL
   swelling and reduced entry into the capillary barrier. However, the
   trapping of flushing solution, containing PCE, could potentially lead to
   longer remediation times. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A diesel fuel contaminated aquifer in Menziken, Switzerland was treated
   for 4.5 years by injecting aerated groundwater, supplemented with KNO3
   and NH4H2PO4 to stimulate indigenous populations of petroleum
   hydrocarbon (PHC) degrading microorganisms. After dissolved PHC
   concentrations had stabilized at a low level, engineered in situ
   bioremediation was terminated. The main objective of this study was to
   evaluate the efficacy of intrinsic in situ bioremediation as a follow-up
   measure to remove PHC remaining in the aquifer after terminating
   engineered in situ bioremediation. In the first 7 months of intrinsic in
   situ bioremediation, redox conditions in the source area became more
   reducing as indicated by lower concentrations of SO42- and higher
   concentrations of Fe(II) and CH4. In the core of the source area,
   strongly reducing conditions prevailed during the remaining study period
   (3 years) and dissolved PHC concentrations were higher than during
   engineered in situ bioremediation. This suggests that biodegradation in
   the core zone was limited by the availability of oxidants. In lateral
   zones of the source area, however, gradually more oxidized conditions
   were reestablished again, suggesting that PHC availability increasingly
   limited biodegradation. The total DIC production rate in the aquifer
   decreased within 2 years to about 25\% of that during engineered in situ
   bioremediation and remained at that level. Stable carbon isotope
   analysis confirmed that the produced DIC mainly originated from PHC
   mineralization. The total rate of DIC and CH4 production in the source
   area was more than 300 times larger than the rate of PHC elution. This
   indicates that biodegradation coupled to consumption of naturally
   occurring oxidants was an important process for removal of PHC which
   remained in the aquifer after terminating engineered measures. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The pressure required for a chlorinated solvent to enter a geological
   medium can be calculated given knowledge of the characteristic pore size
   of the medium and the interfacial tension (IFT) and contact angle of the
   solvent-water-rock system. Using a centrifuge-based method, capillary
   pressure-saturation curves have been determined for 30 water-saturated
   samples of Permo-Triassic sandstones for the solvent tetrachloroethene
   (PCE). These curves have been successfully fitted using the van
   Genuchten function to determine PCE entry pressure for each of the
   sandstone samples. A plot of PCE entry pressures against average pore
   diameter shows a linear relationship in log-log space; however, observed
   values for PCE entry pressure are significantly lower than would be
   expected theoretically for a sandstone- PCE-water system. This may be
   explained either by a decrease in the IFT or an increase in the contact
   angle. The IFT may decrease during contact with sandstones due to
   hysteresis effects during imbibition and drainage of fluids, but this is
   unlikely to be sufficient to account for the low entry pressures
   observed. Therefore, it is inferred that the low observed PCE entry
   pressures are due to higher than expected PCE contact angles, and that
   the average pore-throat surface of the sandstones is more solvent
   wetting than would be expected. A weak acid extraction indicates the
   presence of calcite and dolomite in the sandstone cores, and a
   correlation is observed between carbonate content per unit porosity and
   a reduction in PCE entry pressure. It is suggested that these mineral
   phases are responsible for observed wettability changes and a conceptual
   model is proposed. One consequence of the lower observed entry pressures
   is that solvents are likely to penetrate deeper into the matrix of
   water-saturated sandstones than previously expected. (C) 2002 NERC.

Abstract = {{In riverbank filtration, contaminant transport is affected by colloidal
   particles such as dissolved organic matter (DOM) and bacterial
   particles. In addition, the subsurface heterogeneity influences the
   behavior of contaminant transport in riverbank filtration. A
   mathematical model is developed to describe the contaminant transport in
   dual-porosity media in the presence of DOM and bacteria as mobile
   colloids. In the model development, a porous medium is divided into the
   mobile and immobile regions to consider the presence of ineffective
   micropores in physically heterogeneous riverbanks. We assume that the
   contaminant transport in the mobile region is controlled by the
   advection and dispersion while the contaminant transport in the immobile
   region occurs due to the molecular diffusion. The contaminant transfer
   between the mobile and immobile regions takes place by diffusive mass
   transfer. The mobile region is conceptualized as a four-phase system:
   two mobile colloidal phases, an aqueous phase, and a solid matrix. The
   complete set of governing equations is solved numerically with a fully
   implicit finite difference method. The model results show that in
   riverbank filtration, the contaminant can migrate further than expected
   due to the presence of DOM and bacteria. In addition, the contaminant
   mobility increases further in the presence of the immobile region in
   aquifers. A sensitivity analysis shows that in dual-porosity media,
   earlier breakthrough of the contaminant takes place as the volumetric
   fraction of the mobile region decreases. It is also demonstrated that as
   the contaminant mass transfer rate coefficient between the mobile and
   immobile regions increases, the contaminant concentration gradient
   between the two regions reverses at earlier pore volumes. The
   contaminant mass transfer coefficient between the mobile and immobile
   regions mainly controls the tailing effect of the contaminant
   breakthrough. The contaminant breakthrough curves are sensitive to
   changes in contaminant adsorption and desorption rate coefficients on
   DOM and bacteria. In situations where the contaminant is released in the
   presence of DOM and bacteria in dual-porosity media, the early
   breakthrough and tailing occur due to the colloidal facilitation and
   presence of immobile regions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The theoretical development for one-dimensional, coupled migration of
   solutes with different ionic mobilities through clay soils that behave
   as ion-restrictive membranes, referred to as clay membrane barriers
   (CMBs), is presented. The transport formulation is based on principles
   of irreversible thermodynamics and accounts explicitly for coupling
   effects of hyperfiltration (ultrafiltration) and chemico-osmotic
   counter-advection associated with clay membrane behavior in the absence
   of electrical current. Since, by definition, no solute can enter a
   ``perfect{''} or ``ideal{''} membrane, the concept of an implicit
   coupling effect, such that the effective salt-diffusion coefficient, DS
   approaches zero as the chemico-osmotic efficiency coefficient, omega
   approaches unity is introduced. The theoretical development also
   illustrates that, even in the absence of membrane behavior, traditional
   advective-dispersive transport theory based on a constant value of DS
   for the solutes may not be appropriate for simulating transient
   transport in reactive (ion exchanging) systems. This potential
   limitation is illustrated through simulations for solute mass flux
   involving the migration of a binary salt solution (KCl) through a clay
   barrier with exchange sites saturated with a single exchangeable cation
   (e.g., Na+) that enters the pore solution upon ion exchange with the
   salt cation (K+). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Light nonaqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs), such as fuels, are the source
   of much soil and groundwater contamination. Though the mobility of
   LNAPLs is limited in many environments, dissolved-phase components, such
   as benzene, can produce groundwater plumes that are more mobile than the
   LNAPL source. In such a setting, it is commonly assumed that recovery of
   the LNAPL will result in a reduction in risk associated with the
   dissolved phase. This paper synthesizes several existing multiphase and
   chemical transport solutions into a single linked methodology that
   predicts concentrations of soluble constituents within and downgradient
   of LNAPL source zones from dissolution of those constituents into
   groundwater flowing through and below LNAPL sources. This approach has
   been applied to a variety of LNAPL spill conditions. For biodegradable
   compounds, these analyses show that the period of time where the
   dissolved-phase plume is expanding is very small compared to the
   duration of most LNAPL sources, and that the downgradient extent is
   generally less than about 100 m for BTEX compounds. Therefore, the risk
   to receptors, as measured by the maximum downgradient extent of
   dissolved-phase plume or the maximum concentration of these compounds at
   a downgradient receptor, is generally unrelated to the longevity of the
   LNAPL sources. The maximum downgradient extent of the dissolved-phase
   plume is determined almost entirely by the groundwater velocity and the
   biodegradation rate. These analyses further demonstrate that recovery of
   LNAPL by hydraulic methods is often ineffective at reducing risk. Except
   in coarse-grained soils or intermediate soils with significant LNAPL
   saturations, free-product recovery approaches do not result in
   significant reductions in the longevity of downgradient dissolved-phase
   contamination. Further, for biodegradable constituents, remediation does
   not result in a near-term decrease in the downgradient extent of
   contamination. Cleanup methods that act to change the composition of the
   LNAPL source are more effective at reducing the downgradient
   concentrations, particularly for fine-grained soils or when LNAPL
   saturations are low. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of removal of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) from
   the entrapment source zone of the subsurface has been limited by soil
   heterogeneity and the inability to locate all entrapped sources. The
   goal of this study was to demonstrate the uncertainty of degree of
   source removal associated with aquifer heterogeneity. In this
   demonstration, source zone NAPL removal using surfactant-enhanced
   dissolution was considered. Model components that simulate the processes
   of natural dissolution in aqueous phase and surfactant-enhanced
   dissolution were incorporated into an existing code of contaminant
   transport. The dissolution modules of the simulator used previously
   developed Gilland-Sherwood type phenomenological models of NAPL
   dissolution to estimate mass transfer coefficients that are upscaleable
   to multidimensional flow conditions found at field sites. The model was
   used to simulate the mass removal from 10 NAPL entrapment zone
   configurations based on previously conducted two-dimensional tank
   experiments. These entrapment zones represent the NAPL distribution in
   spatially correlated random fields of aquifer hydraulic conductivity.
   The numerical simulations representing two-dimensional conditions show
   that effectiveness of mass removal depends on the aquifer heterogeneity
   that controls the NAPL entrapment and delivery of the surfactant to the
   locations of entrapped NAPLs. Flow bypassing resulting from
   heterogeneity and the reduction of relative permeability due to NAPL
   entrapment reduces the delivery efficiency of the surfactant, thus
   prolonging the remediation time to achieve desired end-point NAPL
   saturations and downstream dissolved concentrations. In some extreme
   cases, the injected surfactant completely bypassed the NAPL source
   zones. It was also found that mass depletion rates for different NAPL
   source configurations vary significantly. The study shows that
   heterogeneity result in uncertainties in the mass removal and achievable
   end-points that are directly related to dissolved contaminant plume
   development downstream of the NAPL entrapment zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Groundwater contamination due to complex organic mixtures such as coal
   tar, creosote and fuels is a widespread problem in industrialized
   regions. Although most compounds in these mixtures are biodegradable,
   the contaminant sources are very persistent for many decades after the
   contamination occurred (e.g., more than 100 years ago at gasworks
   sites). This limited bioavailability is due to slow dissolution
   processes. This study presents results from a large scale tank
   experiment (8 m long) on the long-term (354 days) dissolution kinetics
   of BTEX and PAHs from a 2.5 m long coal tar pool and 0.5 m long (smear)
   zone containing coal tar blobs distributed in a coarse sand. The results
   indicate (1) that Raoult's law holds for estimation of the saturation
   aqueous concentrations of the coal tar constituents, (2) that for the
   dissolution of smear zones longer than approximately 0.1 m and with more
   than 3-5\% residual saturation, the local equilibrium assumption is
   valid and (3) that although very small (< 0.1 mm), the transverse
   vertical dispersivity dominates the pool dissolution processes. Typical
   time scales for removal of the pollutants from the blob zone and the
   pool are in the order of a few weeks to more than 10,000 years,
   respectively. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This study concerns in situ fluidization (ISF), a new remediation method
   with potential application to the remediation of NAPL and heavy metal
   contaminants, by their release from the fluidized zone generated by a
   water jet. The present study examines the effect of ISF on layers of
   peat, of significance owing to its role as an important NAPL and metal
   contaminant trap. Once trapped, such contaminants are not readily
   accessible by most remedial methods, due to the low permeability and
   diffusivity of the peat. A simple tank experiment is used to demonstrate
   rupture of a peat layer by ISF, with removal of the peat as elutriated
   fines and segregated peat chunks. The application of ISF in the field is
   then examined by three field trials in uncontaminated sands, in both
   saturated and unsaturated conditions. Fluidized depths of up to 1.9 m in
   the saturated zone (with refusal on a peat layer) and 2.5 m in the
   unsaturated zone (no refusal) were attained, using a 1.9-m-long, 50 mm
   diameter jet operated at 5-13 l s(-1). Pulses of dark turbidity and
   shell fragments in the effluent indicated the rupture of peat and shelly
   layers. The experiments demonstrate the hydraulic viability of ISF in
   the field, and its ability to remove peat-based contaminants. The issues
   of appropriate jet design and water generation during ISF are discussed,
   followed by a preliminary economic analysis of ISF relative to existing
   remediation methods. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{In situ air sparging has the potential to augment the removal of
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminants in soil vapour extraction
   (SVE) systems when the NAPL is present in the capillary fringe or below
   the water table. NAPL removal can also be enhanced from above the water
   table by improving air access. Results are presented from a pilot-scale
   field trial aimed at evaluating the performance of such a remediation
   strategy where in situ air sparging was used in conjunction with a soil
   vapour extraction system to remove weathered gasoline NAPL from an
   unconfined sandy aquifer. A simple analysis that partitions extracted
   soil vapour between air injected through the sparge well and air drawn
   from the atmosphere across the soil surface, together with petroleum
   hydrocarbon concentrations in the extracted soil vapour, was used to
   interpret the effectiveness of air sparging. The composition and mass of
   the NAPL in the aquifer were also monitored along with observations on
   the distribution of air in the aquifer. Results showed that sparged air
   constituted 42\% of the extracted soil vapour but contributed the
   majority of the petroleum hydrocarbons removed. For the first 5 days of
   sparging, hydrocarbon concentrations in the sparged air were in
   equilibrium with the NAPL in the aquifer leading to total petroleum
   hydrocarbon concentrations in the combined system being three to four
   times greater than for soil vapour extraction alone. Petroleum
   hydrocarbon concentrations in the extracted soil vapour decreased over
   time as a result of the depletion of the more volatile constituents from
   the NAPL, possible development of mass transfer limitations and
   increased fraction of clean air from depleted zones. Overall, 65\% of
   the 673 kg of petroleum hydrocarbons extracted in soil vapour over a
   period of 30 days was carried in sparged air from the single sparge
   well. Percentages of the mass carried in the sparged air were even
   higher (median 70\%) for individual aromatic hydrocarbons. Inclusion of
   air sparging increased the mass extracted by a factor of 1.9 (more for
   individual petroleum hydrocarbons) over and above that for soil vapour
   extraction alone for the 30 days of sparging. Air sparging was also
   effective in removing residual NAPL from below the water table. The mass
   of petroleum hydrocarbons removed from the site was not reflected in
   changes to the mass of NAPL in the aquifer. This result is apparently
   due to lateral inflow of NAPL to the site although evidence of a
   depleted source of volatilised hydrocarbons suggests the possible
   development of mass transfer limitations. Crown Copyright (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Numerical experiments of non-reactive and reactive transport were
   carried out to quantify the influence of a seasonally varying, transient
   flow field on transport and natural attenuation at a
   hydrocarbon-contaminated field site. Different numerical schemes for
   solving advective transport were compared to assess their capability to
   model low transversal dispersivities in transient flow fields. For the
   field site, it is shown that vertical plume spreading is largely
   inhibited, particularly if sorption is taken into account. For the
   reactive simulations, a biodegradation reaction module for the
   geochemical transport model PHT3D was developed. Results of the reactive
   transport simulations show that under the site-specific conditions the
   temporal variations in groundwater flow do, to a modest extent, affect
   average biodegradation rates and average total (dissolved) contaminant
   mass in the aquifer. The model simulations demonstrate that the seasonal
   variability in groundwater flow only results in significantly enhanced
   biodegradation rates when a differential sorption of electron donor
   (toluene) and electron acceptor (sulfate) is assumed. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   at this chlorinated solvent site. In the first stage of the MNA
   assessment process, the field data collected from four monitoring wells
   located in different parts of the plume were used to complete a
   biodegradation scoring analysis recommended by the protocol. The
   analysis indicates that the site has the potential for natural
   attenuation. In the second stage, a detailed conceptual model was
   developed to identify various contaminant transport pathways and
   exposure points. The U.S. EPA model and BIOCHLOR was used to assess
   whether the contaminants are attenuating at a reasonable rate along
   these transport paths so that MNA can be considered as a feasible
   remedial option for the site. The site data along with the modeling
   results indicate that the chlorinated ethene and chlorinated ethane
   plumes are degrading and will attenuate within 1000 ft down gradient
   from the source, well before reaching the identified exposure point.
   Therefore, MNA can be considered as one of the feasible remediation
   options for the site. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Bacterial growth and its interaction with water flow was investigated in
   a two-dimensional flow field in a saturated porous medium. A flow cell
   (56 X 44 X 1 cm) was filled with glass beads and operated under a
   continuous flow of a mineral medium containing nitrate as electron
   acceptor. A glucose solution was injected through an injection port,
   simulating a point source contamination. Visible light transmission was
   used to observe the distribution of the growing biomass and water flow
   during the experiment. At the end of the experiment (on day 3 1), porous
   medium samples were destructively collected and analyzed for abundance
   of total and active bacterial cells, bacterial cell volume and
   concentration of polysaccharides and proteins. Microbial growth was
   observed in two stripes along the length of the flow cell, starting at
   the glucose injection port, where highest biomass concentrations were
   obtained. The spatial distribution of biomass indicated that microbial
   activity was limited by transverse mixing between glucose and nitrate
   media, as only in the mixing zone between the media high biological
   activities were achieved. The ability of the biomass to change the flow
   pattern in the flow cell was observed, indicating that the biomass was
   locally reducing the hydraulic conductivity of the porous medium. This
   bioclogging effect became evident when the injection of the glucose
   solution was turned off and water flow still bypassed the area around
   the glucose injection port, preserving the flow pattern as it was during
   the injection of the glucose solution. As flow bypass was possible in
   this system, the average hydraulic properties of the flow cell were not
   affected by the produced biomass. Even in the vicinity of the injection
   port, the total volume of the bacterial cells remained below 0.01\% of
   the pore space and was unlikely to be responsible for the bioclogging.
   However, the bacteria produced large amounts of extracellular polymeric
   substances (EPS), which likely caused the observed bioclogging effects.

Abstract = {{The codisposal of toxic metals and radionuclides with organic chelating
   agents has been implicated in the facilitated transport of the inorganic
   contaminants away from primary waste disposal areas. We investigated the
   transport of Co(II)NTA through undisturbed cores of fractured shale
   saprolite. Experiments were conducted across the pH range 4 to 8 by
   collecting cores from different locations within the weathering profile.
   Aqueous complexation, adsorption, dissociation and oxidation reactions
   influenced Co(II)NTA transport. The suite of reaction products
   identified in column effluent varied with experimental pH. At low pH and
   in the presence of abundant exchangeable aluminum, Co transport occurred
   predominantly as the Co2+ ion. At higher pH, Co was transported
   primarily as Co(II)NTA and the Co(III) species Co-II(HNTA)(2) and
   Co-II(IDA)(2). The formation of the geochemical oxidation products
   (Co(III) species) has far reaching implications as these compounds are
   kinetically and thermodynamically stable, are transported more rapidly
   than Co(II)NTA, and are resistant to biodegradation. These results
   demonstrate that natural minerals, in the physical structure encountered
   naturally, can be more important in the formation of mobile, stable
   contaminant forms than they can be for the retardation and dissociation
   of the contaminants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical and experimental study of transport phenomena underlying
   anaerobic bioventing (ABV) is presented. Understanding oxygen exclusion
   patterns in vadose zone environments is important in designing an ABV
   process for bioremediation of soil contaminated with chlorinated
   solvents. In particular, the establishment of an anaerobic zone of
   influence by nitrogen injection in the vadose zone is investigated.
   Oxygen exclusion experiments are performed in a pilot scale flow cell (2
   X 1.1 X 0.1 m) using different venting flows and two different outflow
   boundary conditions (open and partially covered). Injection gas
   velocities are varied from 0.25 X 10(-3) to 1.0 X 10(-3) cm/s and are
   correlated with the ABV radius of influence. Numerical simulations are
   used to predict the collected experimental data. In general, reasonable
   agreement is found between observed and predicted oxygen concentrations.
   Use of impervious covers can significantly reduce the volume of forcing
   gas used, where an increase in oxygen exclusion efficiency is consistent
   with a decrease in the outflow area above the injection well. (C) 2002

Volume = {{58}},

Abstract = {{Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) represent the major organic constituent of
   landfill leachate and provide the greatest potential for leachate
   induced organic contamination of groundwater (e.g. as represented by an
   increase in the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and chemical
   oxygen demand). Long-term diffusion tests were performed for
   laboratory-compacted clayey soil plugs exposed to continuous supply of
   synthetic leachate containing VFAs. Significant microbial activity
   developed upon exposure of the soil's indigenous microorganisms to these
   degradable contaminants. The growth of heterotrophic aerobic bacteria
   (HAB, which include facultative anaerobes), sulfate reducing bacteria
   (SRB) and methanogenic bacteria carrying out fermentation and
   mineralization of the VFAs became evident after 30-50 days of testing.
   The maximum microbial counts of (2 - 8) x 10(8) and (0.1 - 1) x 10(8)
   cfu/g for HAB and SRB were localized in the soil layer at the interface
   with the source of organic and inorganic nutrients. Regardless of this
   rapid growth in microbial population, the VFA consumption was small and
   measurable only after a lag of 140-180 days. It is considered that this
   lag of otherwise readily degradable organic compounds (such as VFAs)
   persisted due to a combination of the effects of a high initial
   concentration of these acids (2.4 g/l as dissolved organic carbon, DOC)
   applied to carbon starved soil microorganisms and the small pore size of
   the compacted clay. Once the significant amounts of gas were generated
   from fermentation, conditions developed for improved mass transport and
   exchange of the nutrients and bacteria and the outcome of the intrinsic
   degradation was more apparent. The breakdown of VFAs that followed after
   the lag was localized near the top of the soil and was characterized by
   a short half-life of 0.75-5 days for DOC (total VFAs as dissolved
   organic carbon). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a recent field study on dune recharge, bacteriophages MS2 and PRDI
   were found to be removed 3 logo over the first 2.4 m and only 5 log(10)
   over the next 27 m. To understand the causes of this nonlinear removal,
   column experiments were carried out under conditions similar to the
   field: same recharge water, temperature (5 +/- 3degreesC) and pore water
   velocity (1.5 in day(-1)). Soil samples were taken along a streamline
   between the recharge canal and the first monitoring well. Bacteriophage
   phiX174 was included for comparison. The high initial removal in the
   field was found not to be due to heterogeneity of phage suspensions but
   to soil heterogeneity. Phage removal rates correlated strongly
   positively with soil organic carbon content, and relatively strongly
   positively with silt content and the presence of ferric oxyhydroxides.
   Soil organic carbon content, silt content and the presence of ferric
   oxyhydroxides were found to decrease exponentially with travel distance.
   Removal rates of phiX174 were found to be 3-10 times higher than those
   of MS2 and PRDI due to the lower electrostatic repulsion that the less
   negatively charged phiX174 experiences. It is suggested that the high
   initial removal in the field is due to the presence of favorable sites
   for attachment formed by ferric oxyhydroxides that decrease
   exponentially with travel distance. Similar removal rates may be found
   at both laboratory and field scale. However, due to local variations at
   field scale detailed knowledge on soil heterogeneity may be needed to
   enable a reliable prediction of removal. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Local dispersion dominates the mixing of compounds that are introduced
   separately into the subsurface and do not partition into any other than
   the aqueous phase. Thus, reactions between these compounds are
   controlled by dispersive mixing if they are not limited by kinetics. I
   quantify longitudinal dispersive mixing by the longitudinal effective
   dispersion coefficient of a conservative tracer introduced by a
   point-like injection {[}Water Resour. Res. 36 (12) (2000) 3591-3604]. In
   the upscaling of mixing-controlled reactive transport, I apply the mean
   velocity and the effective dispersion coefficient to the macroscopic
   transport calculations, whereas the reactive parameters on the
   macro-scale are identical to those on the local scale. The applicability
   of the approach is demonstrated for the transport of compounds
   undergoing a second-order irreversible bimolecular reaction. Ten
   realizations of a two-dimensional heterogeneous log-conductivity field
   are considered. Using the effective dispersion parameters, the overall
   mass balance is met in the ensemble average, whereas solute spreading is
   underestimated. I assess the lack of spreading by the difference between
   the expected macrodispersion and effective dispersion coefficients. I
   extend the approach to simulations on log-conductivity fields obtained
   by kriging of regularly spaced conductivity measurements. These fields
   contain the large-scale features of the true fields but do not resolve
   the small-scale variability. For the calculations on the kriged fields,
   the corresponding conditional covariance is substituted into the
   analytical expressions of effective dispersion, yielding a correction
   effective dispersion coefficient. The comparison between simulations on
   the fully resolved fields and on the kriged fields indicates that the
   approach is valid for wide plumes meeting the ergodicity condition. The
   high variability of mixing on small scales unresolved by kriging,
   however, leads to severe uncertainty when mixing-controlled reactions
   are predicted for narrow plumes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The impact of macropore description on solute transport predictions in
   soils is not well understood. A 2-D Galerkin finite element model was
   used to compare different approaches for describing macropore flow in
   soil. The approaches were: a modification of the hydraulic conductivity
   function (Hydraulic function), the lumping of all macropores into one
   single straight macropore (Lumping), the use of an exchange factor
   between microporosities and macroporosities that occupy the same area
   (Dual porosity), and a detailed description of each macropore (Full
   description, base case). Simulated breakthrough curves were obtained
   with domains that contained one or more macropores of different shapes
   under both steady state and transient flow conditions. The Hydraulic
   function approach was not sensitive to macropore continuity and
   tortuosity. When the macropores were open at the soil surface and the
   solute was surface applied, the first three approaches underestimated
   both breakthrough curves and solute distribution in the profile compared
   to the Full description approach. When the solute was initially
   incorporated in the soil, the first three approaches overestimated the
   breakthrough curves compared to the Full description approach. The first
   three approaches also underestimated the heterogeneity of solute
   distribution in the profile compared to the Full description approach,
   mostly when the macropores were tortuous. The differences between
   predicted breakthrough curves with different approaches decreased with
   an increase in tortuosity and a decrease in surface continuity. To
   simplify macropore description, the Dual porosity approach was the
   better of the first three approaches for predicting breakthrough curves
   provided the exchange factor between macropores and matrix porosity was
   available. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Models developed for solute transport vary in their assumptions on
   macropore continuity and tortuosity. It is unclear how much
   simplification can be made in computer models to characterize macropore
   effects on water and solute transport through soils. The objectives of
   this study were to assess how the importance of macropore continuity and
   tortuosity varies (1) with various initial and boundary conditions (this
   paper) and (2) with simplifying model assumptions for macropore
   description (companion paper). The above assessments were made with a
   computer model based on 2-D Galerkin finite element solution of
   Richards' equation for water flow and convective -dispersive equation
   for solute transport. The model can simultaneously handle macropores of
   varying length, size, shape, and continuity. Model predictions were in
   agreement with laboratory data for different macropore shapes and
   continuities under transient flow conditions. Simulations for various
   initial and boundary conditions showed that surface connected macropores
   under ponded conditions and under high intensity rainfalls favored the
   rapid transport of solutes. However, solute transport was delayed it the
   solute was initially incorporated in the soil even when macropores were
   connected to the soil surface. Macropores not connected to the soil
   surface only slightly accelerated solute transport for any boundary
   conditions. Macropore tortuosity did not influence breakthrough curves
   as much as the continuity but greatly influenced solute distribution in
   the profile. The importance of macropore continuity and tortuosity on
   preferential transport increased with an increase in solute retardation.
   General guidelines for simplifying continuity and tortuosity for
   modeling solute transport are presented for various initial and boundary
   conditions. 0 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Column experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of
   humic colloids on subsurface uranium migration. The columns were packed
   with well-characterized aeolian quartz sand and equilibrated with
   groundwater rich in humic colloids (dissolved organic carbon (DOC): 30
   mg dm-3). U migration was studied under an At/1\% CO2 gas atmosphere as
   a function of the migration time, which was controlled by the flow
   velocity or the column length. In addition, the contact time of U with
   groundwater prior to introduction into a column was varied. U(VI) was
   found to be the dominant oxidation state in the spiked groundwater. The
   breakthrough curves indicate that U was transported as a humic
   colloid-borne species with a velocity up to 5\% faster than the mean
   groundwater flow. The fraction of humic colloid-bome species increases
   with increasing prior contact time and also with decreasing migration
   time. The migration behavior was attributed to a kinetically controlled
   association/dissociation of U onto and from humic colloids and also a
   subsequent sorption of U onto the sediment surface. The column
   experiments provide an insight into humic colloid-mediated U migration
   in subsurface aquifers. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Title = {{Bench-scale visualization of DNAPL remediation processes in analog

Abstract = {{We have conducted well-controlled DNAPL remediation experiments within a
   2-D, glass-walled, sand-filled chamber using surfactants (Aerosol MA and
   Tween 80) to increase solubility and an oxidant (permanganate) to
   chemically degrade the DNAPL. Initial conditions for each remediation
   experiment were created by injecting DNAPL as a point source at the top
   of the chamber and allowing the DNAPL to migrate downward through a
   water-filled, heterogeneous, sand-pack designed to be evocative of a
   fluvial depositional environment. This migration process resulted in the
   DNAPL residing as a series of descending pools. Lateral advection across
   the chamber was used to introduce the remedial fluids. Photographs and
   digital image analysis illustrate interactions between the introduced
   fluids and the DNAPL. In the surfactant experiments, we found that DNAPL
   configured in a series of pools was easily mobilized. Extreme reductions
   in DNAPL/water interfacial tension occurred when using the Aerosol MA
   surfactant, resulting in mobilization into low permeability regions and
   thus confounding the remediation process. More modest reductions in
   interfacial tension occurred when using the Tween 80 surfactant
   resulting in modest mobilization. In this experiment, capillary forces
   remained sufficient to exclude DNAPL migration into low permeability
   regions allowing the excellent solubilizing properties of the surfactant
   to recover almost 90\% of the DNAPL within 8.6 pore volumes. Injection
   of a potassium pennanganate solution resulted in precipitation of MnO2,
   a reaction product, creating a low-permeability rind surrounding the
   DNAPL pools. Formation of this rind hindered contact between the
   permanganate and the DNAPL, limiting the effectiveness of the
   remediation. From these experiments, we see the value of performing
   visualization experiments to evaluate the performance of proposed
   techniques for DNAPL remediation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Fracture ``skins{''} are alteration zones on fracture surfaces created
   by a variety of biological, chemical, and physical processes. Skins
   increase surface area, where sorption occurs, compared to the unaltered
   rock matrix. This study examines the sorption of organic solutes on
   altered fracture surfaces in an experimental fracture-flow apparatus.
   Fracture skins containing abundant metal oxides, clays, and organic
   material from the Breathitt Formation (Kentucky, USA) were collected in
   a manner such that skin surface integrity was maintained. The samples
   were reassembled in the lab in a flow-through apparatus that simulated
   similar to 2.7 m of a linear fracture ``conduit.{''} A dual-tracer
   injection scheme was utilized with the sorbing or reactive tracer
   compared to a non-reactive tracer (chloride) injected simultaneously.
   Sorption was assessed from the ratio of the first temporal moments of
   the breakthrough curves and from the loss of reactive tracer mass and
   evaluated as a function of flow velocity and solute type. The
   breakthrough curves suggest dual-flow regimes in the fracture with both
   sorbing and non-sorbing flow fields. Significant sorption occurs for the
   reactive components, and sorption increased with decreasing flow rate
   and decreasing compound solubility. Based on moment analysis, however,
   there was little retardation of the center of solute mass. These data
   suggest that non-equilibrium sorption processes dominate and that slow
   desorption and boundary layer diffusion cause extensive tailing in the
   breakthrough curves. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A residual non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) present in the vadose zone
   can act as a contaminant source for many years as the compounds of
   concern partition to infiltrating groundwater and air contained in the
   soil voids. Current pressure-saturation-relative permeability
   relationships do not include a residual NAPL saturation term in their
   formulation. This paper presents the results of series of two- and
   three-phase pressure cell experiments conducted to evaluate the residual
   NAPL saturation and its impact on the pressure-saturation relationship.
   A model was proposed to incorporate a residual NAPL saturation term into
   an existing hysteretic three-phase parametric model developed by Parker
   and Lenhard {[}Water Resour. Res. 23(12) (1987) 2187], Lenhard and
   Parker {[}Water Resour. Res. 23(12) (1987) 2197] and Lenhard {[}J.
   Contam. Hydrol. 9 (1992) 243]. The experimental results indicated that
   the magnitude of the residual NAPL saturation was a function of the
   maximum total liquid saturation reached and the water saturation. The
   proposed model to incorporate a residual NAPL saturation term is similar
   in form to the entrapment model proposed by Parker and Lenhard, which
   was based on an expression presented by Land {[}Soc. Pet. Eng. J. (June
   1968) 149]. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Transverse dispersion is the most relevant process in mass transfer of
   contaminants across the capillary fringe (both directions), dilution of
   contaminants, and mixing of electron acceptors and electron donors in
   biodegrading groundwater plumes. This paper gives an overview on
   literature values of transverse vertical dispersivities alpha(tv)
   measured at different flow velocities and compares them to results from
   well-controlled laboratory-tank experiments on mass transfer of
   trichloroethene (TCE) across the capillary fringe. The measured values
   of transverse vertical dispersion in the capillary fringe region were
   larger than in fully saturated media, which is credited to enhanced
   tortuosity of the flow paths due to entrapped air within the capillary
   fringe. In all cases, the values observed for alpha(tv) were << 1 mm.
   The new measurements and the literature values indicate that alpha(tv)
   apparently declines with increasing flow velocity. The latter is
   attributed to incomplete diffusive mixing at the pore scale (pore
   throats). A simple conceptual model, based on the mean square
   displacement and the pore size accounting for only partial diffusive
   mixing at increasing flow velocities, shows very good agreement with
   measured and published data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring radon in groundwater can be used as an in situ
   partitioning tracer for locating and quantifying non-aqueous phase
   liquid (NAPL) contamination in the subsurface. When combined with the
   single-well, push-pull test, this methodology has the potential to
   provide a low-cost alternative to inter-well partitioning tracer tests.
   During a push-pull test, a known volume of test solution (radon-free
   water containing a conservative tracer) is first injected
   ({''}pushed{''}) into a well; flow is then reversed and the test
   solution/groundwater mixture is extracted ({''}pulled{''}) from the same
   well. In the presence of NAPL radon transport is retarded relative to
   the conservative tracer. Assuming linear equilibrium partitioning,
   retardation factors for radon can be used to estimate NAPL saturations.
   The utility of this methodology was evaluated in laboratory and field
   settings. Laboratory push-pull tests were conducted in both
   non-contaminated and trichloroethene NAPL (TCE)-contaminated sediment.
   The methodology was then applied in wells located in non-contaminated
   and light non-aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL)-contaminated portions of an
   aquifer at a former petroleum refinery. The method of temporal moments
   and an approximate analytical solution to the governing transport
   equations were used to interpret breakthrough curves and estimate radon
   retardation factors; estimated retardation factors were then used to
   calculate TCE saturations. Numerical simulations were used to further
   investigate the behavior of the breakthrough curved. The laboratory and
   field push-pull tests demonstrated that radon retardation does occur in
   the presence of TCE and LNAPL and that radon retardation can be used to
   calculate TCE saturations. Laboratory injection-phase test results in
   TCE-contaminated sediment yielded radon retardation factors ranging from
   1.1 to 1.5, resulting in calculated TCE saturations ranging from 0.2 to
   0.9\%. Laboratory extraction-phase test results in the same sediment
   yielded a radon retardation factor of 5.0, with a calculated TCE
   saturation of 6.5\%. Numerical simulation breakthrough curves provided
   reasonably good matches to the approximate analytical solution
   breakthrough curves. However, non-equilibrium radon partitioning and
   heterogeneous TCE distributions may affect the retardation factors and
   TCE saturation estimates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Direct pumping and enhanced recovery of coal tar and creosote dense,
   non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) from the subsurface have had mixed
   results because these DNAPLs are viscous fluids that can potentially
   alter aquifer wettability. To improve the inefficiencies associated with
   waterflooding, the research presented here considered the use of a
   polymer solution that can be added to the injected flood solution to
   increase the viscosity and decrease the velocity of the flooding
   solution. Results from one-dimensional, vertically oriented laboratory
   column experiments that evaluate the recovery of coal-derived DNAPL with
   both water and polymer flooding solutions are presented. The final DNAPL
   saturation remaining in the column was assessed in water and oil-wet
   systems for three viscous DNAPLs. Adding polymer to increase the aqueous
   solution viscosity did not have a significant impact in water-wet
   systems. A final DNAPL saturation of approximately 19\% was achieved for
   both water and polymer floods. In contrast, the addition of polymer
   significantly improved recovery in oil-wet systems. The final saturation
   was over 40\% in oil-wet systems after waterflooding, but approximately
   19\% with a polymer flushing solution. Although the final saturation
   produced with polymer flooding was similar between the oil- and
   water-wet systems, differences in the relative permeability and
   distribution of DNAPL in the porous matrix caused the DNAPL recovery to
   be much slower in the oil-wet system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{In situ, sequential, anaerobic to aerobic treatment of groundwater
   removed perchloroethene (PCE, 1.1 muM) and benzene (0.8 muM) from a
   contaminated aquifer. Neither aerobic nor anaerobic treatment alone
   successfully degraded both the chlorinated and non-chlorinated organic
   contaminants in the aquifer. After the sequential treatment, PCE,
   trichloroethene (TCE), vinyl chloride (VC), chloroethane (CA), and
   benzene were not detectable in groundwater. Desorption of residual
   aquifer contaminants was tested by halting the groundwater recirculation
   and analyzing the groundwater after 3 and 7 weeks. No desorption of the
   chlorinated contaminants or daughter products was observed in the
   treated portion of the aquifer. Sequential anaerobic to aerobic
   treatment was successful in remediating the groundwater at this test
   site and may have broad applications at other contaminated sites. Over
   the 4-year course of the project, the predominant microbial environment
   of the test site varied from aerobic to sulfate-reducing, to
   methanogenic, and back to aerobic conditions. Metabolically active
   microbial populations developed under all conditions, demonstrating the
   diversity and robustness of natural microbial flora in the aquifer. (C)

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model for virus transport in physically and
   geochemically heterogeneous subsurface porous media is presented. The
   model involves solution of the advection-dispersion equation, which
   additionally considers virus inactivation in the solution, as well as
   virus removal at the solid matrix surface due to attachment
   (deposition), release, and inactivation. Two surface inactivation models
   for the fate of attached inactive viruses and their subsequent role on
   virus attachment and release were considered. Geochemical heterogeneity,
   portrayed as patches of positively charged metal oxyhydroxide coatings
   on collector grain surfaces, and physical heterogeneity, portrayed as
   spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, were incorporated in the
   model. Both layered and randomly (log-normally) distributed physical and
   geochemical heterogeneities were considered. The upstream weighted
   multiple cell balance method was employed to numerically solve the
   governing equations of groundwater flow and virus transport. Model
   predictions show that the presence of subsurface layered geochemical and
   physical heterogeneity results in preferential flow paths and thus
   significantly affect virus mobility. Random distributions of physical
   and geochemical heterogeneity have also notable influence on the virus
   transport behavior. While the solution inactivation rate was found to
   significantly influence the virus transport behavior, surface
   inactivation under realistic field conditions has probably a negligible
   influence on the overall virus transport. It was further demonstrated
   that large virus release rates result in extended periods of virus
   breakthrough over significant distances downstream from the injection
   sites. This behavior suggests that simpler models that account for virus
   adsorption through a retardation factor may yield a misleading
   assessment of virus transport in ``hydrogeologically sensitive{''}
   subsurface environments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Fracturing, either pneumatic or hydraulic, is a method to improve the
   performance of soil vapor extraction (SVE) in relatively low
   permeability soils (< 10(-5) cm/s). A two-dimensional model is presented
   to simulate trichloroethylene (TCE) soil vapor extraction modified by
   fracturing. Flow and transport is modeled using mobile macropore and
   micropore networks, which also have been identified in the literature as
   dual porosity, dual permeability, or heterogeneous flow models. In this
   model, fluids can flow in both the macropore and micropore networks.
   This represents a more general model compared to immobile micropore,
   mobile macropore models presented thus far in the literature for vapor
   flow and transport in two dimensions. The model considers pressure- and
   concentration-driven exchange between the macropore and micropore
   networks, concentration-driven exchange between the gas and sorbed
   phases within each network, and equilibrium exchange between the gas and
   water and a sorbed phase within each network. The parameters employed in
   an example simulation are based on field measurements made at a
   fractured site. Considered in the simulations were the influence of the
   volume percentage of fractures, the length of fractures, the relative
   location of the water table, and the influence of pulsed pumping. For
   these simulations, inter-network concentration-driven exchange most
   significantly affected mass removal. The volume percentage of fractures
   more significantly influence flow and mass removal than the length of
   fractures. The depth of the water table below the contamination plume
   only significantly influenced flow and mass removal when the water table
   was within 60 cm of the bottom of the contaminated soil in the vadose
   zone for the parameters considered in this study. Pulsed pumping was not
   found to increase the amount of mass removed in this study. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A laboratory diffusion cell technique that permits spatial and temporal
   estimates of porewater concentrations over short intervals suitable for
   estimation of effective diffusion coefficients (D-c) and degradation
   rate constants (k) of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in saturated low
   permeability media is presented. The diffusion cell is a sealed cylinder
   containing vapour reservoirs for sampling, including a vapour reservoir
   source and an array of vapour-filled ``mini-boreholes{''}, which are
   maintained water- and sediment-free by slightly negative porewater
   pressures. The vapour reservoirs were sampled by Solid Phase
   Micro-Extraction (SPME), resulting in minimal disturbance to the
   experimental system. Porewater concentrations are estimated from the
   measured vapour concentrations. Experiments were conducted using a
   non-reactive medium and five VOCs with a range in partitioning
   properties. Calibration experiments showed that equilibrium partition
   coefficients could be used for calculating concentrations in the vapour
   reservoir source from concentrations in the SPME coating after a 1-min
   microextraction and that the reservoir concentration was insignificantly
   affected by sampling. However, equilibrium was not reached during the
   one-min extraction of the boreholes; the microextraction reduced the
   borehole vapour concentrations, leading to diffusion of VOCs from
   porewater into the vapour-filled borehole. Thus, empirical partitioning
   coefficients were required for the determination of porewater VOC
   concentrations. The experimental data and numerical modelling indicate
   masses extracted by SPME extraction are relatively small, with minimal
   perturbation on processes studied in diffusion experiments. This
   technique shows promise for laboratory investigation of diffusion and
   transformation processes in low permeability media. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {{Effect of pore-water velocity on chemical nonequilibrium transport of
   Cd, Zn, and Pb in alluvial gravel columns}},

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effects of pore-water velocity on chemical
   nonequilibrium during transport of Cd, Zn, and Pb through alluvial
   gravel columns. Three pore-water velocities ranging from 3 to 60 m/day
   were applied to triplicate columns for each metal. Model results for the
   symmetric breakthrough curves (BTCs) of tritium ((H2O)-H-3) data suggest
   that physical nonequilibrium components were absent in the uniformly
   packed columns used in these studies. As a result, values of pore-water
   velocity and dispersion coefficient were estimated from fitting
   (H2O)-H-3 BTCs loan equilibrium model. The BTCs of metals display long
   tailing, indicating presence of chemical nonequilibrium in the system,
   which was further supported by the decreased metal concentrations during
   flow interruption. The BTCs of the metals were analysed using a two-site
   model, and transport parameters were derived using the CXTFIT
   curve-fitting program. The model results indicate that the partitioning
   coefficient (beta), forward rate (k(1)), and backward rate (k(2)) are
   positively correlated with pore-water velocity (V); while the
   retardation factor (R), mass transfer coefficient (omega), and ratio of
   k(1)/k(2) are inversely correlated with V There is no apparent
   relationship between the fraction of exchange sites at equilibrium (f)
   and V The influence of Von k(2) is much greater than on R, beta, omega,
   and k(1). A one-order-of-magnitude change in V would cause a
   two-order-of-magnitude change in k(2) while resulting in only a one
   order-of-magnitude change in R, beta, omega, and k(1). The forward rates
   for the metals are found to be two to three orders-of-magnitude greater
   than the corresponding backward rate. However, the difference between
   the two rates reduces with increasing pore-water velocity. Model results
   also suggest that Cd and Zn behave similarly, while Pb is much more
   strongly sorbed. At input concentrations of about 4 mg/l and pore-water
   velocities of 3-60 m/day in the groundwater within alluvial gravel, this
   study suggests retardation factors of 26-289 for Cd, 24-255 for Zn, and
   322-6377 for Pb. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Breakthrough curves, on a semi-log scale, from tests in porous media
   with block-input of viruses, bacteria, protozoa and colloidal particles
   often exhibit a typical skewness: a rather slowly rising limb and a
   smooth transition of a declining limb to a very long tail. One-site
   kinetic models fail to fit the rising and declining limbs together with
   the tail satisfactorily. Inclusion of an equilibrium adsorption site
   does not seem to improve simulation results. This was encountered in the
   simulation of breakthrough curves from a recent field study on the
   removal of bacteriophages MS2 and PRDI by passage through dune sand. In
   the present study, results of laboratory experiments for the study of
   this issue are presented. Breakthrough curves of salt and bacteriophages
   MS2, PRD1, and phiX174 in ID column experiments have been measured. One-
   and two-site kinetic models have been applied to fit and predict
   breakthrough curves from column experiments. The two-site model fitted
   all breakthrough curves very satisfactorily, accounting for the skewness
   of the rising limb as well as for the smooth transition of the declining
   limb to the tail of the breakthrough curve. The one-site model does not
   follow the curvature of the breakthrough tail, leading to an
   overestimation of the inactivation rate coefficient for attached
   viruses. Interaction with kinetic site I is characterized by relatively
   fast attachment and slow detachment, whereas attachment to and
   detachment from kinetic site 2 is fast. Inactivation of viruses and
   interaction with kinetic site 2 provide only a minor contribution to
   removal. Virus removal is mainly determined by the attachment to site 1.
   Bacteriophage phiX174 attached more than MS2 and PRD1, which can be
   explained by the greater electrostatic repulsion that MS2 and PRDI
   experience compared to the less negatively charged phiX174. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Overflows and leakage from aboveground storage tanks and pipelines
   carrying crude oil and petroleum products occur frequently. The spilled
   hydrocarbons pose environmental threats by contaminating the surrounding
   soil and the underlying ground water. Predicting the fate and transport
   of these chemicals is required for environmental risk assessment and for
   remedial measure design. The present paper discusses the formulation and
   application of the Oil Surface Flow Screening Model (OILSFSM) for
   predicting the surface flow of oil by taking into account infiltration
   and evaporation. Surface flow is simulated using a semi-analytical model
   based on the lubrication theory approximation of viscous flow.
   Infiltration is simulated using a version of the Green and Ampt
   infiltration model, which is modified to account for oil properties.
   Evaporation of volatile compounds is simulated using a compositional
   model that accounts for the changes in the fraction of each compound in
   the spilled oil. The coupling between surface flow, infiltration and
   evaporation is achieved by incorporating the infiltration and
   evaporation fluxes into the global continuity equation of the spilled
   oil. The model was verified against numerical models for infiltration
   and analytical models for surface flow. The verification study
   demonstrates the applicability of the model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Inverse methods used in assessing landfill liner design have not yet
   taken advantage of current developments in inverse procedures. Here, a
   method for inverting contaminant transport models is presented including
   a general error model and procedures for differentially weighted
   multiple response regression. General error models are employed in cases
   where the residuals are heteroscedastic and correlated, and lead to
   valid inference on model parameter and predictive uncertainty. The
   Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm is used to optimise model
   parameters. Model parameter uncertainty is assessed by exploring the
   posterior probability distribution with the Metropolis algorithm, a
   Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling method. The inverse method is applied
   to simultaneously determine the sorption and diffusion parameters from
   laboratory diffusion cell experiments. In these experiments, fluoride
   migration through kaolin clays was measured by sampling the source and
   collector cells over time. To uniquely determine the transport model
   parameters, it was necessary to simultaneously fit the observed data
   from two independent diffusion cell experiments with different initial
   concentrations. The jointly fitted transport model parameters compared
   well with those fitted to independent batch experiments. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{We are experimentally studying, by means of short-pulse injection, the
   transport and deposition kinetics of suspended particles (silts of the
   order of 10 mum) in a highly permeable medium consisting of a column of
   gravel. In our experiments, the breakthrough curves (BTCs) are well
   described by analytical solutions of a convection/dispersion model with
   first-order deposition kinetics. All the transport parameters calculated
   by the model for both particles and dissolved tracer depend on the flow
   rate. We demonstrate the existence of a critical flow rate, determined
   experimentally, beyond which the transfer time for the particles is
   longer than that for the tracer. This phenomenon is unusual in
   comparison with the results available in the literature. The increase in
   transfer time of particles in comparison to tracer leads us to assume a
   purely mechanical phenomenon, that is, collision between particles and
   grains of the medium with instantaneous reset in motion when the flow
   rate is sufficient to avoid settling. Thanks to the polydispersivity of
   the injected suspension and the control of grain size at the outlet, it
   can also be determined that the coarser particles are recovered before
   the finer particles, as expected when one considers the size-exclusion
   effect. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A polyphasic approach based on cultivation and direct recovery of 16S
   rRNA gene sequences was utilized for microbial characterization of an
   aquifer contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. This work was conducted
   in order to support the evaluation of natural attenuation of chlorinated
   ethenes in groundwater at Area 6 at Dover Air Force Base (Dover, DE).
   Results from these studies demonstrated the aquifer contained relatively
   low biomass (e.g. direct microscopic counts of < 10(7) bacteria/g of
   sediment) comprised of a physiologically diverse group of microorganisms
   including iron reducers, acetogens, sulfate reducers, denitrifiers,
   aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs. Laboratory microcosms prepared with
   authentic sediment and groundwater provided direct microbiological
   evidence that the mineralization of vinyl chloride and
   cis-dichloroethene as well as each step in the complete reductive
   dechlorination of tetracloroethene to ethene can occur in the Area 6
   aquifer. Enrichment cultures capable of the oxidative degradation of
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) were obtained
   from groundwater across the aquifer demonstrating the possible
   importance of direct, non-cometabolic oxidation of cis-DCE and VC in
   natural attenuation. Culture-independent analyses based upon recovery of
   16S rRNA gene sequences revealed the presence of anaerobic organisms
   distributed primarily between two major bacterial divisions: the delta
   subdivision of the Proteobacteria and low-G + C gram positive. Recovery
   of sequences affiliated with phylogenetic groups containing known
   anaerobic-halorespiting organisms such as Desulfitobacterium,
   Dehalobacter, and certain groups of iron reducers provided qualitative
   support for a role of reductive dechlorination processes in the aquifer.
   This molecular data is suggestive of a functional linkage between the
   microbiology of the site and the apparent natural attenuation process.
   The presence and distribution of microorganisms were found to be
   consistent with a microbially driven attenuation of chlorinated ethenes
   within the aquifer and in accord with a conceptual model of aquifer
   geochemistry which suggest that both reductive and oxidative mechanisms
   are involved in heterogeneous, spatially distributed processes across
   the aquifer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has recently emerged as a viable
   groundwater remediation technology in the United States. Area 6 at Dover
   Air Force Base (Dover, DE) was chosen as a test site to examine the
   potential for MNA of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE)
   in groundwater and aquifer sediments. A ``lines of evidence{''} approach
   was used to document the occurrence of natural attenuation. Chlorinated
   hydrocarbon and biogeochemical data were used to develop a site-specific
   conceptual model where both anaerobic and aerobic biological processes
   are responsible for the destruction of PCE, TCE, and daughter
   metabolites. An examination of groundwater biogeochemical data showed a
   region of depleted dissolved oxygen with elevated dissolved methane and
   hydrogen concentrations. Reductive dechlorination likely dominated in
   the anaerobic portion of the aquifer where PCE and TCE levels were
   observed to decrease with a simultaneous increase in
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE), vinyl chloride (VC), ethene, and
   dissolved chloride. Near the anaerobic/aerobic interface, concentrations
   of cis-DCE and VC decreased to below detection limits, presumably due to
   aerobic biotransformation processes. Therefore, the contaminant and
   daughter product plumes present at the site appear to have been
   naturally attenuated by a combination of active anaerobic and aerobic
   biotransformation processes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Laboratory column experiments were conducted by employing various porous
   media to delineate the characteristics of gaseous ozone transport in the
   unsaturated zone under various conditions. Water content, soil organic
   matter (SOM), and metal oxides (MOs) were found to be the factors most
   influential in the fate and transport of gaseous ozone in unsaturated
   porous media. The migration velocity of the gaseous ozone front was
   inversely proportional to the MO content of the porous media. Increased
   water content at fixed gas flux decreased the ozone breakthrough time
   proportionally as a result of reduced gas pore volume (PV) in the
   column, and increased pore water interfered with reactions of gaseous
   ozone with SOM and MOs on the surface of porous media. The feasibility
   of in-situ ozone injection for the remediation of unsaturated soils
   contaminated with either phenanthrene or diesel-range organics (DROs)
   was investigated under various conditions. The maximum removal after 1 h
   of ozone injection was achieved in columns packed with baked sand,
   followed, in descending order, by glass beads and by sand, indicating
   that catalytic ozone decomposition with MOs in columns packed with baked
   sand enhanced hydroxyl radical formation and resulted in increased
   contaminant removal. Overall removal efficiency of multicomponent
   C-10-C-24 DROs after 14 h of ozonation was 78.7\%. Ozone transport was
   retarded considerably because of the high ozone demand of DROs,
   requiring more than 6 It for the gaseous ozone to initially break
   through the soil column under the experimental conditions tested in this
   study. Overall, gaseous ozone was readily delivered and transported to
   remediate unsaturated soils contaminated with phenanthrene and DROs. (C)

Abstract = {{The vadose zone is the intermediate medium between the atmosphere and
   groundwater. The modeling of the processes taking place in the vadose
   zone needs different approaches to those needed for groundwater
   transport problems because of the marked changes in environmental
   conditions affecting the vadose zone. A mathematical model to simulate
   the water flow, and the fate and transport of recalcitrant contaminants
   was developed, which could be applied to various bioremediation methods
   such as phytoremediation and natural attenuation in the vadose zone.
   Two-phase flow equations and heat flux models were used to develop the
   model. Surface energy balance equations were used to estimate soil
   surface temperature, and root growth and root distribution models were
   incorporated to represent the special contribution of plant roots in the
   vegetated soils. Interactions between the roots and environmental
   conditions such as temperature and water content were treated by
   incorporating a feedback mechanism that made allowance for the effects
   of water and temperature stresses on root distribution and water uptake
   by roots. In conducting the modeling study, Johnson grass and implanted
   soil were simulated to compare the effect of root water uptake on soil
   water content. After the numerical experiments were conducted to
   investigate model behavior, the proposed model was applied to estimate
   actual water flow and heat flow in field lysimeter experiments over a
   1-year period. Root growth and distribution for Johnson grass and rye
   grass were simulated to compare the warm season grass to the cold season
   grass. A significant agreement was observed between the simulations and
   measured data. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In modeling transport within naturally heterogeneous aquifers, it is
   usually assumed that the transport equations valid at local scales can
   also be applied at larger scales. At larger scales, the heterogeneous
   domain is represented by an equivalent homogeneous medium.
   Convergent-flow tracer tests constitute one of the most frequently used
   field tests to estimate effective input parameters of equivalent
   homogeneous aquifers. Traditionally, statistical approaches applied to
   groundwater flow and solute transport have provided tools to estimate,
   these equivalent parameters. These approaches are based on a number of
   simplifications including the assumption that the point transmissivity
   values follow a multilog-normal random function. Several investigators
   have found that this assumption may not be valid in many field cases. In
   order to study the applicability of the equivalent homogeneous
   formulation in a nontraditional stochastic field, a number of
   experimental and numerical studies were conducted. The results are used
   to determine the apparent values of porosity and dispersivity that would
   be obtained if convergent-flow tracer tests were conducted in a
   deterministically generated heterogeneous transmissivity field
   displaying anisotropy in the correlation structure. It is shown that in
   this particular heterogeneous media, apparent porosity strongly depends
   on connectivity rather than on transmissivity. This dependence on
   connectivity questions the theoretical results obtained in continuum
   equivalent fields to estimate effective porosity. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sorption-desorption hysteresis, slow desorption kinetics, and other
   nonideal phenomena have been attributed to the differing sorptive
   characteristics of the natural organic polymers associated with soils
   and sediments. In this study, aqueous and mixed solvent systems were
   used to investigate the effects of a cosolvent, methanol, on sorption
   isotherm linearity with natural organic matter (NOM), and to evaluate
   whether these results support, or weaken, the rubbery/glassy polymer
   conceptualization of NOM. All of the sorption isotherms displayed some
   nonlinear character. Our data indicates that all of the phenanthrene and
   atrazine isotherms were nonlinear up to the highest equilibrium solution
   concentration to solute solubility in water or cosolvent ratios
   (C-e/S-w,S-c) used, approximately 0.018 and 0.070, respectively.
   Isotherm linearity was also observed to increase with volumetric
   methanol content (f(c)). This observation is consistent with the NOM
   rubbery/glassy polymer conceptualization: the presence of methanol in
   NOM increased isotherm linearity as do solvents in synthetic polymers,
   and suggests that methanol is interacting with the NOM, enhancing its
   homogeneity as a sorptive phase so that sorption is less bimodal as f(c)
   increases. When the equilibrium solution concentration was normalized
   for solute solubility in water or methanol-water solutions, greater
   relative sorption magnitude was observed for the methanol-water
   treatments. This observation, in conjunction with the faster sorption
   kinetics observed in the methanol-water sediment column systems,
   indicates that the increase in relative sorption magnitude with f(c) may
   be attributed to the faster sorption kinetics in the methanol-water
   systems, and hence, greater relative sorptive uptake for the rubbery
   polymer fraction of NOM at similar time scales. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In theories of multiphase flow through porous media, capillary
   pressure-saturation and relative permeability-saturation curves are
   assumed to be intrinsic properties of the medium. Moreover, relative
   permeability is assumed to be a scalar property, However, numerous
   theoretical and experimental works have shown that these basic
   assumptions may not be valid. For example, relative permeability is
   known to be affected by the flow velocity (or pressure gradient) at
   which the measurements are carried out. In this article, it is suggested
   that the nonuniqueness of capillary pressure-relative
   permeability-saturation relationships is due to the presence of
   microheterogeneitics within a laboratory sample. In order to investigate
   this hypothesis, a large number of ``numerical experiments{''} are
   carried out. A numerical multiphase flow model is used to simulate the
   procedures that are commonly used in the laboratory for the measurement
   of capillary pressure and relative permeability curves. The dimensions
   of the simulation domain are similar to those of a typical laboratory
   sample (a few centimeters in each direction). Various combinations of
   boundary conditions and soil heterogeneity are simulated and average
   capillary pressure, saturation, and relative permeability for the ``soil
   sample{''} are obtained. It is found that the irreducible water
   saturation is a function of the capillary number; the smaller the
   capillary number, the larger the irreducible water saturation. Both
   drainage and imbibition capillary pressure curves are found to be
   strongly affected by heterogeneities and boundary conditions. Relative
   permeability is also found to be affected by the boundary conditions;
   this is especially true about the nonaqueous phase permeability. Our
   results reveal that there is much need for laboratory experiments aimed
   at investigating the interplay of boundary conditions and
   microheterogeneitics and their effect on capillary pressure and relative
   permeability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we measure effective diffusion coefficients for
   trichloroethene in undisturbed soil samples taken from Picatinny
   Arsenal, New Jersey. The measured effective diffusion coefficients
   ranged from 0.0053 to 0.0609 cm(2)/S over a range of air-filled porosity
   of 0.23-0.49.
   The experimental data were compared to several previously published
   relations that predict diffusion coefficients as a function of
   air-filled porosity and porosity. A multiple linear regression analysis
   was developed to determine if a modification of the exponents in
   Millington's {[}Science 130 (1959) 100] relation would better fit the
   experimental data. The literature relations appeared to generally
   underpredict the effective diffusion coefficient for the soil cores
   studied in this work. Inclusion of a particle-size distribution
   parameter, d(10), did not significantly improve the fit of the linear
   regression equation.
   The effective diffusion coefficient and porosity data were used to
   recalculate estimates of diffusive flux through the subsurface made in a
   previous study performed at the field site. It was determined that the
   method of calculation used in the previous study resulted in an
   underprediction of diffusive flux from the subsurface. We conclude that
   although Millington's {[}Science 130 (1959) 100] relation works well to
   predict effective diffusion coefficients in homogeneous soils with
   relatively uniform particle-size distributions, it may be inaccurate for
   many natural soils with heterogeneous structure and/or non-uniform
   particle-size distributions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The appropriate prediction of the fate of the contaminant is an
   essential step when evaluating the risk of severe groundwater
   pollutions-in particular in the context of natural attenuation. We
   numerically study the reactive transport of phenanthrene at the field
   scale in a multilayer soil profile based on experimental data. The
   effect of carrier facilitation by dissolved organic carbon is emphasized
   and incorporated in the model. Previously published simulations are
   restricted to the saturated zone and/or to homogeneous soil columns at
   the laboratory scale. A numerical flow and transport model is extended
   and applied to understand and quantify the relevant processes in the
   case of a strongly sorbing hydrophobic organic compound that is subject
   to carrier facilitation in the unsaturated zone. The contaminant
   migration is investigated on long- and short-term time scales and
   compared to predictions without carrier facilitation. The simulations
   demonstrate the importance of carrier facilitation and suggest strongly
   to take this aspect into account. By carrier facilitation breakthrough
   times at the groundwater level decreased from 500 to approximately 8
   years and concentration peaks increased by two orders of magnitude in
   the long-term simulation assuming a temporary spill in an initially
   unpolluted soil with a non-sorbing carrier. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The effects of biofilm growth on flow and solute transport through a
   sandblasted glass parallel plate fracture was investigated. The fracture
   was inoculated using soil micro organisms. Glucose, oxygen and other
   nutrients were supplied to support growth. The biomass initially formed
   discrete clusters attached to the glass surfaces, but over time formed a
   continuous biofilm. From dye tracer tests conducted during biofilm
   growth, it was observed that channels and low-permeability zones
   dominated transport. The hydraulic conductivity of the fracture showed a
   sigmoidal decrease with time. The hydraulic conductivity was reduced by
   a factor of 0.033, from 18 to 0.6 cm/s, corresponding to a 72\% decrease
   in the hydraulic aperture, from 500 to 140 mum. In contrast, the mass
   balance aperture, determined from fluoride tracer tests, remained
   relatively constant, indicating that the impact of biomass growth on
   effective fracture porosity was much less than the effect on hydraulic
   conductivity. Analyses of pre-biofilm tracer tests revealed that both
   Taylor dispersion and macrodispersion were influencing transport. During
   biofilm growth, only macrodispersion was dominant. The macrodispersion
   coefficient alphamacro was found to increase logarithmically with
   hydraulic conductivity reduction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Organic contaminants that decrease the surface tension of water
   (surfactants) can have an effect on unsaturated flow through porous
   media due to the dependence of capillary pressure on surface tension. We
   used an intermediate-scale 2D flow cell (2.44 x 1.53 x 0.108 m) packed
   with a fine silica sand to investigate surfactant-induced flow
   perturbations. Surfactant solution (7\% 1-butanol and dye tracer) was
   applied at a constant rate at a point source located on the soil surface
   above an unconfined synthetic aquifer with ambient groundwater flow and
   a capillary fringe of similar to55 cm. A glass plate allowed for visual
   flow and transport observations. Thirty instrumentation stations consist
   of time domain reflectometry probes and tensiometers measured in-situ
   moisture content and pressure head, respectively. As surfactant solution
   was applied at the point source, a transient flow perturbation
   associated with the advance of the surfactant solution was observed.
   Above the top of the capillary fringe the advance of the surfactant
   solution caused a visible drainage front that radiated from the point
   source. Upon reaching the capillary fringe, the drainage front caused a
   localized depression of the capillary fringe below the point source
   because the air-entry pressure decreased in proportion to the decrease
   in surface tension caused by the surfactant. Eventually, a new capillary
   fringe height was established. The height of the depressed capillary
   fringe was proportional to height of the initial capillary fringe
   multiplied by the relative surface tension of the surfactant solution.
   The horizontal transport of surfactant in the depressed capillary
   fringe, driven primarily by the ambient groundwater flow, caused the
   propagation of a wedge-shaped drying front in the downgradient
   direction. Comparison of dye transport during the surfactant experiment
   to dye transport in an experiment without surfactant indicated that
   because surfactant-induced drainage decreased the storage capacity of
   the vadose zone, the dye breakthrough time to the water table was more
   than twice as fast when the contaminant solution contained surfactant.
   The extensive propagation of the drying front and the effect of vadose
   zone drainage on contaminant breakthrough time suggest the importance of
   considering surface tension effects on unsaturated flow and transport in
   systems containing surface-active organic contaminants or systems, where
   surfactants are used for remediation of the vadose zone or unconfined
   aquifers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the long-term behavior of breakthrough curves (BTCs) and
   temporal moments of a solute subjected to Freundlich equilibrium
   sorption (s=kc(n)). For one-dimensional transport in a homogeneous
   porous medium, we derived a power-law relation between travel time, tau,
   and solute displacement,., with the exponent being equal to the
   Freundlich n exponent. The mean solute velocity, derived from the first
   time moment, was found to change as tau(n-1). For n values larger than
   0.66, the second time moment could be related to c (x) over bar (2/n),
   where c is a constant. An approach based on the use of a critical
   concentration was developed to estimate the presence of the asymptotic
   regime in the tail of the BTC. This approach was tested successfully
   using numerical case studies. One-dimensional numerical simulations with
   varying values of k, n and initial mass were run to verify the closed
   form analytical expressions for the large time behavior of temporal
   moments and the tailing pail of breakthrough Curves. Good agreement
   between the slope of the tailing part of log-log transformed BTCs and
   the predicted slope using asymptotic theory was found. Asymptotic theory
   in general underestimated the magnitude of the concentration in the
   tail. The quality of the estimated concentrations in the tail improved
   for small values of the dispersivity. Experimental BTCs of uranin and
   benazolin were analyzed in combination with sorption/desorption batch
   experiments using asymptotic theory. A good agreement between the value
   of n parameter derived from desorption experiment with benazolin and the
   value of the n parameter derived from the tail of the BTC was found. (C)

Title = {{Formulation of a soil-pesticide transport model based on a compartmental

Abstract = {{A semianalytical soil-pesticide transport model is formulated based on a
   compartmental approach to determine spatial and temporal variations of
   pesticide residues across a soil profile. The compartmental model is
   implemented by drawing an analogy between a series of continuous-flow
   stirred tank reactors and a soil horizon that consists of multiple
   perfectly mixed compartments. The analogy is strengthened by exploiting
   a relation between the compartment series and the conventional
   convective-dispersive equation (CDE) for vertical transport in the soil.
   Consequently, the number of compartments in the model formulation is not
   free, but dictated as a function of transport parameters. The model
   formulation allows consideration of arbitrary boundary value
   specifications and also, for some cases, spatially varying initial
   concentration profiles. Sorption kinetics is represented via a two-site
   model that involves a linear sorption isotherm and a first-order
   irreversible sorption or a radial diffusive penetrating model. For these
   three cases, analysis of the compartmental model allows the resultant
   concentration profiles to be expressed in terms of the Poisson
   distribution. When a nonlinear kinetic sorption model is used to
   simulate the sorption processes, an analytical solution is not found and
   a numerical approach is required. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We develop a method to compute interfacial areas from three-dimensional
   digital representations of multiphase systems. We approximate the
   interfaces with the isosurface generated by the standard marching-cube
   algorithm from the discrete phase distribution. We apply this approach
   to two-fluid pore-scale simulations by (1) simulating a random packing
   of spheres that obeys the grain-size distribution and porosity of an
   experimental porous medium system, and (2) using a previously developed
   pore-morphology-based model in order to predict the phase distribution
   for a water-wet porous medium that undergoes primary drainage. The
   predicted primary drainage curve and interfacial areas are in good
   agreement with the experimental values reported in the literature, where
   interfacial areas were measured using inter-facial tracers. The energy
   dissipation during Haines jumps is significant: thus, the mechanical
   work done on the system is not completely converted into surface energy,
   and interfacial areas may not be deduced from the primary drainage
   curve. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) is an emerging technology for the
   destruction of some chlorinated solvents present in subsurface
   environments. A laboratory investigation using a physical model was
   designed to assess the effectiveness of using permanganate as an oxidant
   to reduce the mass of a perchloroethylene (PCE) pool. The physical model
   was filled with silica sand overlying a silica flour base, simulating a
   vivo-dimensional saturated sand zone overlying a capillary barrier. PCE
   was introduced into the model so that it rested on top of the silica
   flour base, forming a dense nonaqueous phase liquid pool. The
   experimental methodology involved flushing the model with a permanganate
   solution for 146 days. During this period, measurements of chloride were
   used to assess the extent of pool oxidation. Before and after the
   oxidant flush, the quasi-steady state dissolution from the PCE pool was
   evaluated. Additionally, tracer studies were completed to assess changes
   in the flow field due to the oxidation process, At the termination of
   the experiment nine soil cores extracted from the model were used to
   detect the presence of MnO2 deposits and to quantify the mass of PCE
   remaining in the system. Excavation of the remaining material in the
   model revealed that the MnO2 distribution throughout the model was
   consistent with that observed in the cores. The oxidant flush was
   concluded before all of the pure phase PCE had been completely oxidized;
   however, similar to45\% of the PCE mass was removed, resulting in a
   fourfold decrease in the quasi-steady state aqueous phase mass loading
   of PCE from the pool. Measurements of chloride during the oxidant flush
   and of PCE in the soil cores suggested that the oxidation reaction
   occurred primarily at the upgradient edge of the PCE pool. MnO2 deposits
   within the model aquifer decreased the velocity of water directly above
   the pool, and the overall mass transfer from the remaining PCE pool. The
   results of this experimental study indicate that ISCO using permanganate
   is capable of removing substantial mass from a DNAPL pool; however, the
   performance of ISCO as a pool removal technology will be limited by the
   formation and precipitation of hydrous MnO2 that occurs during the
   oxidation process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The gel barrier formation by a gelling liquid (Colloidal Silica)
   injection in an unsaturated porous medium is investigated by developing
   a mathematical model and conducting numerical simulations. Gelation
   process is initiated by adding electrolytes such as NaCl, and the get
   phase consisting of cross-linked colloidal silica particles grows as the
   gelation process proceeds. The mathematical model describing the
   transport and gelation of Colloidal Silica (CS) is based on coupled mass
   balance equations for the gel mixture (the sol phase plus the gel
   phase), gel phase (cross-linked colloidal silica particles plus water
   captured between cross-linked particles), and colloidal silica particles
   (discrete and cross-linked) and NaCl in the sol (suspension of discrete
   colloidal silica particles in water) and gel phases, The solutions in
   terms of volumetric fraction of the gel phase yield the gel mixture
   viscosity via the dependency on the volumetric fraction of gel phase.
   This dependency is determined from a kinetic gelation model with
   time-normalized viscosity curves. The proposed model is verified by
   comparing experimentally and numerically determined hydraulic
   conductivities of gel-treated soil columns at different CS injection
   volumes. The numerical experiments indicate that an impermeable gel
   layer is formed within the time period twice the gel-point in a
   one-dimensional flow system. At the same normalized time corresponding
   to twice the gel-point, the CS solutions with lower NaCl concentrations,
   result in further migration and poor performance in plugging the pore
   space. The viscosity computation proposed in this study is compared with
   another method available in the literature. It is observed that the
   other method estimates the viscosity at the mixing zone higher than the
   one proposed by the authors. The proposed model can simulate realistic
   injection scenarios with various combinations of operating parameters
   such as NaCl concentration and NaCl mixing time, and thus providing
   guidelines in performing this technology on site. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Three treatment cells were operated at a site near Durango, CO. One
   treatment cell operated for more than 3 years. The treatment cells were
   used for passive removal of contamination from groundwater at a uranium
   mill tailings repository site. Zero-valent iron {[}Fe (0)] that had been
   powdered, bound with aluminosilicate and molded into plates was used as
   a reactive material in one treatment cell. The others used granular
   Fe(0) and steel wool. The treatment cells significantly reduced
   concentrations of As, Mn, Mo, Se, U, V and Zn in groundwater that flowed
   through it. Zero-valent iron {[}Fe(0)], magnetite (Fe3O4), Calcite
   (CaCO3), goethite (FeOOH) and mixtures of contaminant-bearing phases
   were identified in the solid fraction of one treatment cell. A reaction
   progress approach was used to model chemical evolution of water
   chemistry as it reacted with the Fe(0). Precipitation of calcite,
   ferrous hydroxide {[}Fe(OH)(2)] and ferrous sulfide (FeS) were used to
   simulate observed changes in major-ion aqueous chemistry. The amount of
   reaction progress differed for each treatment cell. Changes in
   contaminant concentrations were consistent with precipitation of reduced
   oxides (UO2, V2O3), sulfides (As2S3, ZnS), iron minerals (FeSe2, FeMoO4)
   and carbonate (MnCO3). Formation of a free gas phase and precipitation
   of minerals contributed to loss of hydraulic conductivity in one

Abstract = {{A series of field and laboratory experiments were conducted to study the
   mechanisms of particle detachment and transport from fractures in vadose
   chalk. Experiments of intermittent flow events along fracture surfaces
   were carried out in the laboratory. In the field, water was percolated
   from land surface via a discrete fracture into a compartmental sampler
   installed inside a horizontal corehole located I in below the surface.
   The mass, size distribution, and composition of the particles drained
   from the fracture voids were examined along with flow rates and salt
   dissolution. Two boreholes penetrating the underlying saturated zone
   were sampled and analyzed for colloidal concentration and composition.
   Most of the particle and solute release at the drained effluents
   occurred during the first several hours of flow, but erratic pulses of
   particles were still observed after long periods of time. Most of the
   detached particles had a mean diameter of > 2 mum, while the mobile
   colloidal phase in the groundwater had a mean diameter of similar to1
   mum. Mineralogical composition of the groundwater colloids and the
   particles detached from the upper vadose fracture were similar.
   Laboratory observations demonstrated the importance of the existence of
   a coating layer, made of weathered particles and salts, on particle
   detachment. The results of this study suggest that: (1) particle
   detachment causes flow-rate variability in the unsaturated fracture; (2)
   the mechanisms of particle detachment and salt dissolution within the
   fracture are linked, and (3) although most of the detached particles are
   large and likely to accumulate inside fractures, some colloidal
   particles also eroded from the fracture void and are likely to be
   transported to the groundwater. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We performed an experimental study to quantify the critical conditions
   for the mobilization of small pools of dense nonaqueous phase liquids
   (DNAPLs) that may form at capillary-heterogeneity boundaries. A series
   of experiments were conducted in columns packed with uniform sands
   arranged to create capillary heterogeneities. DNAPL pools readily formed
   in these packings and were more easily mobilized than trapped DNAPL
   ganglia. A model was developed to describe the critical conditions for
   DNAPL pool mobilization. Pool mobilization was expected when a
   dimensionless pool trapping number N-T(p)>1 while mobilization was
   observed in our experiments when N-T(p)>0.76+/-0.16 (+/-95\% confidence
   interval). The difference between the model prediction and the
   experimental observations was attributed to experimental error. Using
   this model for DNAPL pool mobilization, a simple numerical experiment
   was conducted to illustrate use of the model and to explore the effect
   of scale on the critical conditions for pool mobilization. With an
   increase in system scale flow bypassing around the DNAPL pool increased
   and the system-averaged conditions for the onset of mobilization
   changed: a greater system-average Darcy flux or lower inter-facial
   tensions were required for DNAPL pool mobilization. This result
   illustrates the importance of system scale on mobilization of DNAPL
   pools in systems with capillary heterogeneities. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Some of the basic assumptions of the advection-dispersion model
   (AD-model) are revisited. This model assumes a continuous mixing along
   the flowpath similar to Fickian diffusion. This implies that there is a
   constant dispersion length irrespective of observation distance. This is
   contrary to most field observations. The properties of an alternative
   model based on the assumption that individual water packages can retain
   their identity over long distances are investigated. The latter model is
   called the multi-channel model (MCh-model). Inherent in the latter model
   is that if the waters in the different pathways are collected and mixed,
   the ``dispersion length{''} is proportional to distance, The conditions
   for when non-mixing between adjacent streams can be assumed are
   explored.
   The MCh- and AD-models are found to have very similar residence time
   distributions (RTD) for Peclet numbers larger than 3. A generalized
   relation between flowrate and residence time is developed, including the
   so-called cubic law and constant aperture assumptions. The two models
   extrapolate very differently when there is strong matrix interaction.
   The AD-model could severely underestimate the effluent concentration of
   a tracer pulse and overestimate the residence time.
   The conditions are explored for when in-filling particles in the
   fracture will not be equilibrated but will act as if there was seemingly
   a much larger flow wetted surface (FWS). It is found that for strongly
   sorbing tracers, relatively small particles can act in this way for
   systems and conditions that are typical of many tracer tests.
   The assumption that the tracer residence time found by cautiously
   injecting a small stream of traced water represents the residence time
   in the whole fracture is explored. It is found that the traced stream
   can potentially sample a much larger fraction of the fracture than the
   ratio between the traced flowrate and the total pumped flowrate,
   The MCh-model was used to simulate some recent tracer tests in what is
   assumed to be a single fracture at the Aspo Hard rock laboratory in
   Sweden. Non-sorbing tracers, HTO and Uranin were used to determine the
   mean residence time and its variance. Laboratory data on diffusion and
   sorption properties were used to ``predict{''} the RTD of the sorbing
   tracers. At least 30 times larger FWS or 1000 times larger diffusion or
   sorption coefficients would be needed to explain the observed BTCs. Some
   possible reasons for such behavior are also explored. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{When steam is injected into soil containing a dense volatile non-aqueous
   phase liquid contaminant the DNAPL vaporized within the heated soil
   region condenses and accumulates ahead of the steam condensation front.
   If enough DNAPL accumulates, gravitational forces can overcome trapping
   forces allowing the liquid contaminant to flow downward. By injecting
   air with steam, a portion of the DNAPL vapor remains suspended in
   equilibrium with the air. decreasing liquid contaminant accumulation
   ahead of the steam condensation front. and thus reducing the possibility
   of downward migration.
   In this work, a one-dimensional theoretical model is developed to
   predict the injection ratio of air to steam that will prevent the
   accumulation of volatile DNAPLs. The contaminated region is modeled as a
   one-dimensional homogeneous porous medium with an initially uniform
   distribution of a single component contaminant. Mass and energy balances
   are combined to determine the injection ratio of air to steam that
   eliminates accumulation of the contaminant ahead of the steam
   condensation front, and hence reduces the possibility of downward
   migration. The minimum injection ratio that eliminates accumulation is
   defined as the optimum injection ratio. Example calculations are
   presented for three DNAPLs. carbon tetrachloride (CCl4),
   trichloroethylene (TCE), and perchloro-ethylene (PCE). The optimum
   injection ratio of air to steam is shown to depend on the initial
   saturation and the volatility of the liquid contaminant. Numerical
   simulation results are presented to validate the model, and to
   illustrate downward migration for ratios less than optimum. Optimum
   injection ratios determined from numerical simulations are shown to be
   in good agreement with the theoretical model. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Steam injection for remediation of porous media contaminated by
   nonaqueous phase liquids has been shown to be a potentially efficient
   technology. There is, however, concern that the technique may lead to
   downward migration of separate phase contaminant. In this work, a
   modification of the steam injection technology is presented, where a
   mixture of steam and air was injected. In two-dimensional experiments
   with unsaturated porous medium contaminated with nonaqueous phase
   liquids, it was demonstrated how injection of pure steam lead to severe
   downward migration, Similar experiments, where steam and air were
   injected simultaneously, resulted in practically no downward migration
   and still rapid cleanup was achieved. The processes responsible for the
   prevention of downward migration when injecting steam-air mixtures were
   analyzed using a nonisothermal multiphase flow and transport model.
   Hereby, three mechanisms were identified and it was demonstrated how the
   effectiveness of these mechanisms depended on the air-to-steam mixing
   ratio. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical models were developed to investigate the characteristics of
   gaseous ozone transport under various soil conditions and the
   feasibility of in situ ozone venting for the remediation of unsaturated
   soils contaminated with phenanthrene. On the basis of assumptions for
   the mass transfer and reactions of ozone, three approaches were
   considered: equilibrium, kinetic, and lump models.
   Water-saturation-dependent reactions of gaseous ozone with soil organic
   matter (SOM) and phenanthrene were employed. The models were solved
   numerically by using the finite-difference method, and the model
   parameters were determined by using the experimental data of Hsu {[}The
   use of gaseous ozone to remediate the organic contaminants in the
   unsaturated soils, PhD Thesis, Michigan State Univ., East Lansing, MI,
   1995].
   The transport of gas-phase ozone is significantly retarded by ozone
   consumption due to reactions with SOM and phenanthrene, in addition to
   dissolution. An operation time of 156 h was required to completely
   remove phenanthrene in a 5-m natural soil column. In actual situations,
   however, the operation time is likely to be longer than the ideal time
   because of unknown factors including heterogeneity of the porous medium
   and the distribution of SOM and contaminant. The ozone transport front
   length was found to be very limited (< 1 m). The sensitivity analysis
   indicated that SOM is the single most important factor affecting in situ
   ozonation for the remediation of unsaturated soil contaminated with
   phenanthrene. Models were found to be insensitive to the reaction
   mechanisms of phenathrene with either gas-phase ozone or dissolved
   ozone. More study is required to quantify the effect of OHcircle
   formation on the removal of contaminant and on ozone transport in the
   subsurface. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{California's dairies are the largest confined animal industry in the
   state. A major portion of these dairies, which have an average herd size
   of nearly 1000 animal units, are located in low-relief valleys and
   basins. Large amounts of liquid manure are generated and stared in these
   dairies. In the semi-arid climate, liquid manure is frequently applied
   via flood or furrow irrigation to forage crops that are grown almost
   year-round. Little is known about the impact of manure management
   practices on water quality of the extensive alluvial aquifers underlying
   these basins. The objective of this work is to assess nitrate and salt
   leaching to shallow groundwater in a relatively vulnerable hydrogeologic
   region and to quantify the impact from individual sources on dairies.
   The complex array of potential point and nonpoint sources was divided
   into three major source areas representing farm management units: (1)
   manure water lagoons (ponds); (2) feedlot or exercise yard, dry manure,
   and feed storage areas (corrals); and (3) manure irrigated forage fields
   (fields). An extensive shallow groundwater-monitoring network (44 wells)
   was installed in five representative dairy operations in the
   northeastern San Joaquin Valley, CA. Water quality (electrical
   conductivity, nitrate-nitrogen, total Kjehldahl nitrogen) was observed
   over a 4-year period. Nitrate-N, reduced nitrogen and electrical
   conductivity (EC, salinity) were subject to large spatial and temporal
   variability. The range of observed nitrate-N and salinity levels was
   similar on all five dairies. Average shallow groundwater nitrate-N
   concentrations within the dairies were 64 mg/l compared to 24 mg/l in
   shallow wells immediately upgradient of these dairies. Average EC levels
   were 1.9 mS/cm within the dairies and 0.8 mS/cm immediately upgradient.
   Within the dairies, nitrate-N levels did not significantly vary across
   dairy management units. However. EC levels were significantly higher in
   corral and pond areas (2.3 mS/cm) than in field areas (1.6 mS/cm)
   indicating leaching from those management units. Pond leaching was
   further inferred from the presence of reduced nitrogen in three of four
   wells located immediately downgradient of pond berms. The estimated
   minimum average annual groundwater nitrate-N and salt loading from
   manure-treated forage fields were 280 and 4300 kg/ha, respectively.
   Leaching rates for ponds are estimated to be on the order of 0.8 m/year,
   at least locally. Since manure-treated fields represent by far the
   largest land area of the dairy, proper nutrient management will be a key
   to protecting groundwater quality in dairy regions overlying alluvial
   aquifers. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The conditions under which rate-limited sorption is important for
   cleanup of layered soils by vapor extraction are investigated. The
   investigation includes two steps: (a) the cleanup time is estimated for
   a number of scenario cases by means of a numerical model and (b) the
   numerical results are approximated using analytical solutions derived
   for simplified models. In this way, equations are derived, which give
   insight into the influence of different parameters characterizing the
   properties of the soil, the geometry of the formation, the mass transfer
   mechanisms in it, and the distribution of the contaminant mass in the
   different phases (gas phase, water phase and solid phase). The numerical
   model used is based on the advection-dispersion differential equations
   for Darcian isothermal airflow, local equilibrium contaminant mass
   transfer between gas phase and soil water and first-order kinetics for
   mass transfer between soil water and solid phase. The numerical results
   are approximated combining an analytical solution to estimate cleanup
   time in layered formations for local equilibrium sorption, which has
   been presented in a previous work (J. Contam. Hydrol., 36 (1999) 105),
   with an analytical solution based on the well-mixed reservoir model
   under consideration of rate-limited sorption. The analytical
   approximation of the cleanup time is in reasonable agreement with the
   numerical results and allows its estimation with small computational
   effort. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two natural-gradient pulse tracer tests were conducted in a
   petroleum-contaminated aquifer to evaluate the potential for benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) biodegradation under enhanced
   nitrate-reducing conditions. Addition of nitrate resulted in loss of
   toluene, ethylbenzene, and m,p-xylenes (TEX) after an initial lag period
   of approximately 9 days. Losses of benzene were not observed over the
   60-day monitoring period. Tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs) were
   analyzed to derive transport and biodegradation parameters, including
   advective velocities, retardation factors, dispersion coefficients,
   biodegradation rate constants, and nitrate utilization ratios. Using the
   parameters derived from the BTC analysis, numerical simulations of one
   of the tracer experiments were conducted using BIONAPL/3D {[}Molson, J.,
   BIONAPL/3D User Guide, A 3D Coupled Flow and Multi-Component Reactive
   transport model. University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada].
   Simulations using the BTC-derived transport and biodegradation
   parameters successfully reproduced benzene, TEX, and nitrate
   concentrations measured during the tracer experiment. Comparisons of
   observed and simulated nitrate concentrations indicate that the mass
   ratio of nitrate-N utilized to TEX degraded increased over time during
   the experiment, reaching values many times that expected based on
   stoichiometry of TEX oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction. Excess
   nitrate loss is likely due to oxidation of other organics in addition to
   TEX. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to quantify nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)
   pool dissolution and its enhancement by in situ biodegradation. The
   experiments were performed using square cross-section, glass-bead packed
   column reactors with a small pool of a toluene-in-dodecane mixture
   (toluene mole fraction, X-tol approximate to 0.02 or 0,09). Experimental
   quasi-steady-state toluene dissolution fluxes were determined using a
   C-14-carbon mass-balance approach during water flushing with and without
   biodegradation, The experiments demonstrated a statistically significant
   bioenhancement of the toluene dissolution flux of up to roughly twofold
   at average pore water velocities of approximately 0.1 and 1 m/day when
   the toluene mole fraction was low ( approximate to 0.02); however,
   little or no bioenhancement was observed with the higher mole fraction
   (approximate to 0.09). Although it cannot be determined conclusively,
   the weight of evidence based on biomass measurements and model analyses
   suggests that the reduced bioenhancement for the high mole fraction was
   due to higher dissolved toluene concentrations, which may have caused
   toxicity effects. Importantly, even though NAPL dissolution was not
   bioenhanced in every case, the biodegradation reduced toluene
   concentrations to low levels in the reactor effluents. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Permeable walls of granular iron are a new technology developed for the
   treatment of groundwater contaminated with dissolved chlorinated
   solvents. Degradation of the chlorinated solvents involves a charge
   transfer process in which they are reductively dechlorinated, and the
   iron is oxidized. The iron used in the walls is an impure commercial
   material that is covered with a passive layer of Fe2O3, formed as a
   result of a high-temperature oxidation process used in the production of
   iron. Understanding the behaviour of this layer upon contact with
   solution is important, because Fe2O3 inhibits mechanisms involved in
   contaminant reduction, including electron transfer and catalytic
   hydrogenation. Using a glass column specially designed to allow for in
   situ Raman spectroscopic and open circuit potential measurements, the
   passive layer of Fe2O3 was observed to be largely removed from the
   commercial product, Connelly iron, upon contact with Millipore water and
   with a solution of Millipore water containing 1.5 mg/l trichloroethylene
   (TCE). It has been previously shown that Fe2O3 is removed from iron
   surfaces upon contact with solution by an autoreduction reaction;
   however, prior to this work, the reaction has not been shown to occur on
   the impure commercial iron products used in permeable granular iron
   walls. The rate of removal was sufficiently rapid such that the initial
   presence of Fe2O3 at the iron surface would have no consequence with
   respect to the performance of an in situ wall. Subsequent to the removal
   of Fe2O3 layer, magnetite and green rust formed at the iron surface as a
   result of corrosion in both the Millipore water and the solution
   containing TCE. The formation of these two species, rather than higher
   valency iron oxides and oxyhydroxides, is significant for the
   technology. The former can interfere with contaminant degradation
   because they inhibit electron transfer and catalytic hydrogenation,
   Magnetite and green rust, in contrast, will not inhibit the mechanisms
   involved in contaminant reduction, and hence their formation is
   beneficial to the longterm performance of the iron material. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Bacteriophage removal by soil passage in two field studies was
   re-analyzed with the goal to investigate differences between one- and
   two-dimensional modeling approaches, differences between one- and
   two-site kinetic sorption models, and the role of heterogeneities in the
   soil properties. The first study involved removal of bacteriophages MS2
   and PRD1 by dune recharge, while the second study represented removal of
   MS2 by deep well injection. In both studies, removal was higher during
   the first meters of soil passage than thereafter. The software packages
   HYDRUS-1D and HYDRUS-2D, which simulate water flow and solute transport
   in one- and two-dimensional variably saturated porous media,
   respectively, were used. The two codes were modified by incorporating
   reversible adsorption to two types of kinetic sites.
   Tracer concentrations were used first to calibrate flow and transport
   parameters of both models before analyzing transport of bacteriophages.
   The one-dimensional one-site model did not fully describe the tails of
   the measured breakthrough curves of MS2 and PRDI from the dune recharge
   study. While the one-dimensional one-site model predicted a sudden
   decrease in virus concentrations immediately after tire peaks, measured
   data displayed much smoother decline and tailing. The one-dimensional
   two-site model simulated the overall behavior of the breakthrough curves
   very well. The two-dimensional one-site model predicted a more gradual
   decrease in virus concentrations after the peaks than the
   one-dimensional one-site model, but not as good as the one-dimensional
   two-site model. The dimensionality of the problem hence can partly
   explain the smooth decrease in concentration after peak breakthrough.
   The two-dimensional two-site model provided the best results. Values for
   k(att2) and k(det2) could not be determined at the last two of four
   monitoring wells, thus suggesting that either a second type of kinetic
   sites is present in the first few meters of dune passage and not beyond
   the second monitoring well, or that effects of soil heterogeneity and
   dimensionality of the problem overshadowed this process. Variations
   between single collector efficiencies were relatively small, whereas
   collision efficiencies varied greatly. This implies that the nonlinear
   removal of MS2 and PRD1 is mainly caused by variations in interactions
   between grain and virus surfaces rather than by physical heterogeneity
   of the porous medium.
   Similarly, a two-site model performed better than the one-site model in
   describing MS2 concentrations for the deep well injection study.
   However, the concentration data were too sparse in this study to have
   much confidence in the fitted parameters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Field-scale processes governing the transport of chelated radionuclides
   in groundwater remain conceptually unclear for highly structured,
   heterogeneous environments. The objectives of this research were to
   provide an improved understanding and predictive capability of the
   hydrological and geochemical mechanisms that control the transport
   behavior of chelated radionuclides and metals in anoxic subsurface
   environments that are complicated by fracture flow and matrix diffusion.
   Our approach involved a long-term, steady-state natural gradient field
   experiment where nonreactive Br- and reactive (CO)-C-57(II)EDTA(2-),
   (109)CdEDTA(2-), and Cr-51(VI) were injected into a fracture zone of a
   contaminated fractured shale bedrock. The spatial and temporal
   distribution of the tracer and solutes was monitored for 500 days using
   an array of groundwater sampling wells instrumented within the
   fast-flowing fracture regime and a slower flowing matrix regime. The
   tracers were preferentially transported along strike-parallel fractures
   coupled with the slow diffusion of significant tracer mass into the
   bedrock matrix. The chelated radionuclides and metals were significantly
   retarded by the solid phase with the mechanisms of retardation largely
   due to redox reactions and sorption coupled with mineral-induced
   chelate-radionuclide dissociation. The formation of significant
   Fe(III)EDTA(-) byproduct that accompanied the dissociation of the
   radionuclide-chelate complexes was believed to be the result of surface
   interactions with biotite which was the only Fe(III)-bearing mineral
   phase present in these Fe-reducing environments. These results counter
   current conceptual models that suggest chelated contaminants move
   conservatively through Fe-reducing environments since they are devoid of
   Fe-oxyhydroxides that are known to aggressively compete for chelates in
   oxic regimes. Modeling results further demonstrated that
   chelate-radionuclide dissociation reactions were most prevalent along
   fractures where accelerated weathering processes are expected to expose
   more primary minerals than the surrounding rock matrix. The findings of
   this study suggest that physical retardation mechanisms (i.e. diffusion)
   are dominant within the matrix regime, whereas geochemical retardation
   mechanisms are dominant within the fracture regime. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Natural analogues allow scientists to investigate biogeochemical
   processes relevant to radioactive waste disposal that occur on time
   scales longer than those that may be studied by time-limited laboratory
   experiments. The Palmottu U-Th deposit in Finland and the Bangombe
   natural nuclear reactor in Gabon involve the study of natural uranium,
   and are both considered natural analogues for subsurface radioactive
   waste disposal. The microbial population naturally present in
   groundwater may affect the redox conditions, and hence, the radionuclide
   solubility and migration. Therefore, groundwater samples from the two
   sites were investigated for microbial populations. The total numbers of
   cells ranged from 10(4) to 10(6) Cells ml(-1). Iron-reducing bacteria
   (IRB) were the largest culturable microbial population in the Palmottu.
   groundwater and were present at up to 1.3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1).
   Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and acetogens could also be cultured
   from the Palmottu groundwater. The numbers of IRB and SRB were largest
   in groundwater with the lowest uranium concentrations, Removal of
   dissolved U(VI) from solution was concomitant with the growth of IRB
   enrichment cultures and the reduction of iron. The redox buffer in the
   Palmottu groundwater consists of iron and uranium species, both of which
   are affected by IRB. IRB and aerobic heterotrophs were cultured from the
   Bangombe groundwater, where redox potentials are buffered by iron and
   organic carbon species. Microbial populations similar to those found at
   Palmottu and Bangombe are found throughout the Fermoscandian Shield, a
   potential host rock for subsurface radioactive waste disposal. These
   results confirm that micro organisms can be expected to play a role in
   stabilizing radioactive waste disposed of in the subsurface by lowering
   redox potential and immobilizing radionuclides. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Over the last few years, more than 40 partitioning interwell tracer
   tests (PITTs) have been conducted at many different sites to measure
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) saturations in the subsurface. While the
   main goal of these PITTs was to estimate the NAPL volume in the
   subsurface, some were specifically conducted to assess the performance
   of remedial actions involving NAPL removal. In this paper, we present a
   quantitative approach to assess the performance of remedial actions to
   recover NAPL that can be used to assess any NAPL removal technology. It
   combines the use of PITTs (to estimate the NAPL volume in the swept pore
   volume between injection and extraction wells of a test area) with the
   use of several cores to determine the vertical NAPL distribution in the
   subsurfiace. We illustrate the effectiveness of such an approach by
   assessing the performance of a surfactant/foarn flood conducted at Hill
   Air Force Base, UT, to remove a TCE-rich NAPL from alluvium with
   permeability contrasts as high as one order of magnitude. In addition,
   we compare the NAPL volumes determined by the PITTs with volumes
   estimated through geostatistical interpolation of aquifer sediment core
   data collected with a vertical frequency of 5-10 cm and a lateral
   borehole spacing of 0.15 m. We demonstrate the use of several
   innovations including the explicit estimation of not only the errors
   associated with NAPL volumes and saturations derived from PITTs but also
   the heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments based upon permeability
   estimates. Most importantly, we demonstrate the reliability of the PITT
   in strongly heterogeneous aquifersediments-a feature of particular
   importance at those sites where the volume of NAPL-contaminated aquifer
   sediments is too large to afford soil coring at a density of sampling
   that yields similar NAPL volumes as the PITT. Finally, the data support
   the proposed performance assessment protocol for NAPL remediation
   combining the use of PITTs and several aquifer sediment cores for
   vertical definition of the NAPL geometry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Large-scale column experiments were undertaken to evaluate the potential
   of in situ polymer mats to deliver oxygen into groundwater to induce
   biodegradation of the pesticides atrazine, terbutryn and fenamiphos
   contaminating groundwater in Perth, Western Australia. The polymer mats,
   composed of woven silicone (dimethylsiloxane) tubes and purged with air,
   were installed in 2-m-long flow through soil columns. The polymer mats
   proved efficient in delivering dissolved oxygen to anaerobic
   groundwater.
   Dissolved oxygen concentrations increased from < 0.2 mg 1(-1) to
   approximately 4 mg 1(-1). Degradation rates of atrazine in oxygenated
   groundwater were relatively high with a zero-order rate of 240-380 mug
   1(-1) or a first-order half-life of 0.35 days. Amendment with an
   additional carbon source showed no significant improvement in
   biodegradation rates, suggesting that organic carbon was not limiting
   biodegradation. Atrazine degradation rates estimated in the column
   experiments were similar to rates determined in laboratory culture
   experiments, using pure cultures of atrazine-mineralising bacteria. No
   significant degradation of terbutryn or fenamiphos was observed under
   the experimental conditions within the time frames of the study. Results
   from these experiments indicate that remediation of atrazine in a
   contaminated aquifer may be achievable by delivery of oxygen using an in
   situ polymer mat system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a large-scale modeling study characterizing fluid
   flow and tracer transport in the unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain,
   Nevada, a potential repository site for storing high-level radioactive
   waste. The study has been conducted using a three-dimensional numerical
   model, which incorporates a wide variety of field data and takes into
   account the coupled processes of flow and transport in the highly
   heterogeneous, unsaturated fractured porous rock. The modeling approach
   is based on a dual-continuum formulation of coupled multiphase fluid and
   tracer transport through fractured porous rock. Various scenarios of
   current and future climate conditions and their effects on the
   unsaturated zone are evaluated to aid in the assessment of the proposed
   repository's system performance using different conceptual models. These
   models are calibrated against field-measured data. Model-predicted flow
   and transport processes under current and future climates are discussed.

Abstract = {{The enhanced solubility of petroleum-derived compounds in humic acid
   solutions is the basis for a new groundwater remediation technology. In
   this unique pilot-scale test, a stationary contaminant source consisting
   of diesel fuel was placed below the water table in a model sand aquifer
   (1.2 x 5.5 x 1.8-m deep) and flushed with water at a flow rate of 2 cm/h
   over 5 years. At 51 days, laboratory grade humic acid was added to the
   water and maintained at a level of approximately 0.8 g/ 1. The addition
   of humic acid had only a small impact on the aqueous transport of the
   BTEX components, which were rapidly dissolved from the diesel, but had a
   large effect on the flushing of PAHs, including methylated naphthalenes
   (MNs). Binding to aqueous humic acid enhanced the solubilization of MNs
   two- to tenfold. During aqueous transport, biodegradation of the BTEX
   and PAHs occurred, limiting the lateral and longitudinal extent of the
   diesel contaminant plume in the model aquifer. It appears that through
   enhanced solubilization, the overall biodegradation rate of the MNs was
   increased. As the various MNs were depleted from the diesel source, the
   MN plume shrank and then disappeared. Crown Copyright (C) 2002 Published

Abstract = {{A pilot scale experiment for humic acid-enhanced remediation of diesel
   fuel, described in Part 1 of this series, is numerically simulated in
   three dimensions. Groundwater flow, enhanced solubilization of the
   diesel source, and reactive transport of the dissolved contaminants and
   humic acid carrier are solved with a finite element Galerkin approach.
   The model (BIONAPL) is calibrated by comparing observed and simulated
   concentrations of seven diesel fuel components (BTEX and methyl-,
   dimethyl- and trimethylnaphthalene) over a 1500-day monitoring period.
   Data from supporting bench scale tests were used to estimate
   contaminant-carrier binding coefficients and to simulate two-site
   sorption of the carrier to the aquifer sand. The model accurately
   reproduced the humic acid-induced 10-fold increase in apparent
   solubility of trimethylnaphthalene. Solubility increases on the order of
   2-5 were simulated for methylnaphthalene and dimethylnaphthalene,
   respectively. Under the experimental and simulated conditions, the
   residual 500-ml diesel source was almost completely dissolved and
   degraded within 5 years. Without humic acid flushing, the simulations
   show complete source dissolution would take about six times longer. (C)

Abstract = {{To determine the effects of concentration history on slow sorption
   processes, desorption kinetic profiles for trichloroethene (TCE) were
   measured for a soil at 10090 relative humidity subject to different
   exposure concentrations and exposure times. Exposure concentrations
   ranged from 1\% to 80\% of the saturation vapor pressure (P-8) for TCE,
   and exposure times (i.e., time allowed for sorption before desorption
   begins) ranged from 1 to 96 days. A spherical diffusion model based on a
   gamma distribution of sorption rates and a gamma distribution of
   desorption rates was developed and applied to the data. At 80\% PIP the
   entire gamma distributions of sorption and desorption rates were
   available for TCE. In accordance with a micropore filling mechanism, the
   fraction of these distributions available for TCE sorption decreased
   with decreasing P/P-S. Experimental results are consistent with a
   micropore-filling mechanism, where the amount of slow desorbing mass
   decreased with decreasing exposure tithe, and the fraction of slow
   desorbing sites filled decreased with decreasing exposure concentration.
   Simulation results suggest that diffusion limits the rates that
   micropores fill, and that rates of sorption and desorption for soil
   contaminated at smaller values of P/P-S, are, on average, less than
   those at larger values of P/P-S, (i.e., slow desorption rates are a
   function of exposure concentration). Simulation results also suggest
   that the model adequately describes the effects of exposure
   concentration and exposure tithe on the rates of sorption and
   desorption, but not on the capacity of the slow sites for TCE. This work
   is important because contaminant concentrations in the subsurface vary
   in space and time, and the proposed model represents a new and
   mechanistically based approach to capture the effects of this
   heterogeneity on slow desorption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All

Abstract = {{Accurate assessment of the fate of salts, nutrients, and pollutants in
   natural, heterogeneous soils requires a proper quantification of both
   spatial and temporal solute spreading during solute movement. The number
   of experiments with multisampler devices that measure solute leaching as
   a function of space and time is increasing. The breakthrough curve (BTC)
   can characterize the temporal aspect of solute leaching, and recently
   the spatial solute distribution curve (SSDC) was introduced to describe
   the spatial solute distribution. We combined and extended both concepts
   to develop a tool for the comprehensive analysis of the full
   spatio-temporal behavior of solute leaching. The sampling locations are
   ranked in order of descending amount of total leaching (defined as the
   cumulative leaching from an individual compartment at the end of the
   experiment), thus collapsing both spatial axes of the sampling plane
   into one. The leaching process can then be described by a curved surface
   that is a function of the single spatial coordinate and time. This
   leaching surface is scaled to integrate to unity, and termed S can
   efficiently represent data from multisampler solute transport
   experiments or simulation results from multidimensional solute transport
   models. The mathematical relationships between the scaled leaching
   surface S, the BTC, and the SSDC are established. Any desired
   characteristic of the leaching process can be derived from S. The
   analysis was applied to a chloride leaching experiment on a lysimeter
   with 300 drainage compartments of 25 cm(2) each. The sandy soil monolith
   in the lysimeter exhibited fingered flow in the water-repellent top
   layer. The observed S demonstrated the absence of a sharp separation
   between fingers and dry areas, owing to diverging flow in the wettable
   soil below the fingers. Times-to-peak, maximum solute fluxes, and total
   leaching varied more in high-leaching than in low-leaching compartments.
   This suggests a stochastic- convective transport process in the
   high-flow streamtubes, while convection-dispersion is predominant in the
   low-flow areas. S can be viewed as a bivariate probability density
   function. Its marginal distributions are the BTC of all sampling
   locations combined, and the SSDC of cumulative solute leaching at the
   end of the experiment. The observed S cannot be represented by assuming
   complete independence between its marginal distributions, indicating
   that S contains information about the leaching process that cannot be
   derived from the combination of the BTC and the SSDC. 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of water content on the volatilization of nonaqueous phase
   liquid (NAPL) in unsaturated soils was characterized by one-dimensional
   venting experiments conducted to evaluate the lumped mass transfer
   coefficient. An empirical correlation based upon the modified Sherwood
   number, Peclet number, and normalized mean grain size was used to
   estimate initial lumped mass transfer coefficients over a range of water
   content. The effects of water content on the soil vapor extraction SVE
   process have been investigated through experimentation and mathematical
   modeling. The experimental results indicated that a rate-limited
   NAPL-gas mass transfer occurred in water-wet soils. A severe mass
   transfer limitation was observed at 61.0\% water saturation where the
   normalized effluent gas concentrations fell below 1.0 almost
   immediately, declined exponentially from the initiation of venting, and
   showed long tailing. This result was attributed to the reduction of
   interfacial area between the NAPL and mobile gas phases due to the
   increased water content. A transient mathematical model describing the
   change of the lumped mass transfer coefficient was used. Simulations
   showed that the nonequilibrium mass transfer process could be
   characterized by the exponent beta, a parameter which described the
   reduction of the specific area available for NAPL volatilization. The
   nonequilibriuim mass transfer limitations were controlled by the soil
   mean grain size and pore gas velocity, were well described by beta
   values below 1.0 at low water saturation, and were well predicted with
   beta values greater than 1.0 at high water saturation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Cedar and Ortega rivers subbasin is a complex environment where both
   natural and anthropogenic processes influence the characteristics and
   distributions of sediments and contaminants, which in turn is of
   importance for maintenance, dredging and pollution control. This study
   investigated the characteristics and spatial distribution of heavy
   metals, including lead (Pb), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd),
   from sediments in the subbasin using field measurements and
   three-dimensional kriging estimates. Sediment samples collected from
   three sampling depth intervals (i.e., 0-0.10, 0.11-0.56 and 0.57-1.88 m)
   in 58 locations showed that concentrations of Pb ranged from 4.47 to
   420.00 mg/kg dry weight, Cu from 2.30 to 107.00 mg/kg dry weight, Zn
   from 9.75 to 2,050.00 mg/kg dry weight and Cd from 0.07 to 3.83 mg/kg
   dry weight. Kriging estimates showed that Pb, Cu and Cd concentrations
   decreased significantly froth the sediment depth of 0.10 to 1.5 m,
   whereas Zn concentrations were still enriched at 1.5 m. It further
   revealed that the Cedar River area was a potential source area since it
   was more contaminated than the rest of the subbasin. Comparison of
   aluminum (Al)-normalized metal concentrations indicated that most of
   tire metals within the top two intervals (0-0.56 m) had concentrations
   exceeding the background levels by factors of 2-10. A three-dimensional
   view of the metal contamination plumes showed drat all of the heavy
   metals, with concentrations exceeding the threshold effect level (TEL)
   that could pose a threat to the health of aquatic organisms, were
   primarily located above the sediment depth of 1.5 m. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Contaminant transport from waste-disposal sites is strongly affected by
   the presence of fractures and the degree of fracture-matrix interaction.
   Characterization of potential contaminant plumes at such sites is
   difficult, both experimentally and numerically. Simulations of water
   flow through fractured rock were performed to examine the penetration
   depth of a large pulse of water entering such a system. Construction
   water traced with lithium bromide was released during the excavation of
   a tunnel at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, which is located in an unsaturated
   fractured tuff formation. Modeling of construction-water migration is
   qualitatively compared with bromide-to-chloride ratio (Br/Cl) data for
   pore-water salts extracted from drillcores. The influences of local
   heterogeneities in the fracture network and variations in hydrogeologic
   parameters were examined by sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo
   simulations. The simulation results are qualitatively consistent with
   the observed Br/Cl signals, although these data may only indicate a
   minimum penetration depth, and water tray have migrated farther through
   the fracture network. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Pages = {{81-98}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulation technology is being investigated as a method for
   controlling pH in situ at contaminated groundwater sites where pH may
   limit remediation of organic contaminants. This study examined the
   effectiveness of using KH2PO4 buffer encapsulated in a pH-sensitive
   coating to neutralize pH in laboratory sand columns (1.5-1) under a
   simulated groundwater flow rate and characterized the pattern of capsule
   release in the flow-through system. Denitrification was used in the
   columns to increase the pH of the pore water. Each of three columns was
   equipped with three miniature mesh wells to allow contact of the buffer
   with column pore water, but capsules (15 g) were inserted into only one
   column (amended). The two other columns served as amendment (no buffer)
   and abiotic (no denitrification) controls. Oxidation-reduction
   potential, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, NH4+, NO3- + NO2-,
   PO43-, and pH were measured in the influent, two side ports, and
   effluent of the columns over time. Near complete conversion of 80 mg N/l
   of nitrate and 152 mg/l of ethanol per day resulted in a mean pH
   increase from 6.2 to 8.2 in the amendment control column. The amended
   column maintained the target pH of 7.0 +/- 0.2 for 4 weeks until the
   capsules began to be depleted, after which time the pH slowly started to
   increase. The capsules exhibited pulses of buffer release, and were
   effectively dissolved after 7.5 weeks of operation. Base-neutralizing
   capacity contributed by the encapsulated buffer over the entire study
   period, calculated as cation equivalents, was 120 mM compared to 8 mM
   without buffer. This study demonstrates the potential for this
   technology to mediate pH changes and provides the framework for future
   studies in the laboratory and in the field, in which pH is controlled in
   order to enhance organic contaminant remediation by pH-sensitive
   systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An electromigration transport model for non-reactive ion transport in
   unsaturated soil was developed and tested against laboratory
   experiments. This model assumed the electric potential field was
   constant with respect to tinge, an assumption valid for highly buffered
   soil, or when the electrode electrolysis reactions are neutralized. The
   model also assumed constant moisture contents and temperature with
   respect to time, and that electroosmotic and hydraulic transport of
   water through the soil was negligible. A functional relationship between
   ionic mobility and the electrolyte concentration was estimated using the
   chemical activity coefficient. Tortuosity was calculated front a
   mathematical relationship fitted to the electrical conductivity of the
   bulk pore water and soil moisture dates. The functional relationship
   between ionic mobility, pore-water concentration, and tortuosity as a
   function of moisture content allowed the model to predict ion transport
   in heterogeneous unsaturated soils. The model was tested against
   laboratory measurements assessing anionic electromigration as a function
   of moisture content. In the test cell, a strip of soil was spiked with
   red dye No 40 and monitored for a 24-h period while a 10-mA current was
   maintained between the electrodes. Electromigration velocities predicted
   by the electromigration transport model were in agreement with
   laboratory experimental results. Both laboratory-measured and
   model-predicted dye migration results indicated a maximum transport
   velocity at moisture contents less than saturation due to competing
   effects between current density and tortuosity as moisture content
   decreases. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All right, reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Results of a field demonstration of electrokinetic transport of acetate
   through an unsaturated heterogeneous soil are compared to numerical
   modeling predictions. The numerical model was based on the groundwater
   Row and transport codes MODFLOW and MT3D modified to account for
   electrically induced ion transport. The G-month field demonstration was
   conducted in an unsaturated layered soil profile where the soil moisture
   content ranged froth 4\% to 28\% (m(3) m(-3)). Specially designed
   ceramic-cased electrodes maintained a steady-state moisture content and
   electric potential field between tile electrodes during the field
   demonstration. Acetate, a byproduct of acetic acid neutralization of the
   cathode electrolysis reaction, was transported From the cathode to the
   anode by electromigration. Field demonstration results indicated
   preferential transport of acetate through soil layers exhibiting higher
   moisture content/electrical conductivity. These field transport results
   agree with theoretical predictions that electromigration velocity is
   proportional to a power function of the effective moisture content. A
   numerical model using a homogeneous moisture content/electrical
   conductivity domain did not adequately predict the acetate field
   results. Numerical model predictions using a three-layer electrical
   conductivity/moisture content profile agreed qualitatively with the
   observed acetate distribution. These results suggest that Geld
   heterogeneities must be incorporated into electrokinetic models to
   predict ion transport at the field-scale. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Title = {{Estimation of local scale dispersion from local breakthrough curves

Abstract = {{The local scale dispersion tensor, D-d, is a controlling parameter for
   the dilution of concentrations in a solute: plume that is displaced by
   groundwater flow in a heterogeneous aquifer. In this paper, we estimate
   the local scale dispersion froth time series or breakthrough curves,
   BTCs, of Br- concentrations that were measured at several pints in a
   fluvial aquifer during a natural gradient tracer test at Krauthausen.
   Locally Measured BTCs were characterized by equivalent convection
   dispersion parameters: equivalent velocity, nu(eq)(x) and expected
   equivalent dispersivity, <lambda(eq)(x)>. A Lagrangian framework was
   used to approximately predict these equivalent parameters in terns of
   the spatial covariance of log(e) transformed conductivity and the local
   scale dispersion coefficient.
   The approximate Lagrangian theory illustrates that <lambda(eq)(x)>
   increases with increasing travel distance and is much larger than the
   local scale dispersivity, lambda(d). A sensitivity analysis indicates
   that <lambda(eq)(x)> is predominantly determined by the transverse
   component of the local scale dispersion and by the correlation scale of
   the hydraulic conductivity in the transverse to flow direction whereas
   it is relatively insensitive to the longitudinal component of the local
   scale dispersion. By comparing predicted <lambda(eq)(x)> for a range of
   D-d values with <lambda(eq)(x)> obtained from locally measured BTCs, the
   transverse component of D-d, D-dT, was estimated. The estimated
   transverse local scale dispersivity, lambda(dT) = D-dT/U-1 (U-1 = mean
   advection velocity) is in the order of 10(1)-10(2) mm, which is
   relatively large but realistic for the fluvial gravel sediments at
   Krauthausen. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The distillation of acidified coal tars for up to 50 years has given
   rise to a phenol plume approximately 500 m long, 50 m deep and
   containing up to 15 g l(-1) dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the
   Triassic Sandstones aquifer. A conceptual biogeochemical model based on
   chemical and microbiological analysis of groundwater samples has been
   developed as a preliminary to more detailed studies of the controls on
   natural attenuation. While the development of redox zones and the
   production of methane and carbon dioxide provide evidence of natural
   attenuation, it appears that degradation is slow. The existence of
   sulphate in the plume indicates that this electron acceptor has not been
   depleted and that consequently methanogenesis is probably limited. Based
   on a simple estimate of sulphate input concentration, a half-life of
   about 15 years has been estimated for sulphate reduction. Geochemical
   modelling predicts that increased alkalinity within the plume has not
   led to carbonate precipitation. and thus within the limits of accuracy
   of the measurement, alkalinity may reflect the degree of biodegradation.
   This implies a loss of around 18\% of the DOC over a 30-year period.
   Despite limited degradation, microbial studies show that there are
   diverse microbial communities in the aquifer with the potential for both
   anaerobic and aerobic biodegradation. Microbial activity was found to be
   greatest at the leading edge of the plume where DOC concentrations are
   60 mg l(-1) or less, but activity could still be observed in more
   contaminated samples even though cells could not be cultured. The study
   suggests that degradation may be limited by the high phenol
   concentrations within the core of the plume, but that once diluted by
   dispersion, natural attenuation may proceed. More detailed studies to
   confirm these initial findings are identified and form the basis of
   associated papers. (C) 2001 NERC. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A quantitative methodology is described for the field-scale performance
   assessment of natural attenuation using plume-scale electron and carbon
   balances. This provides a practical framework for the calculation of
   global mass balances for contaminant plumes, using mass inputs from the
   plume source, background groundwater and plume residuals in a simplified
   box model. Biodegradation processes and reactions included in the
   analysis are identified from electron acceptors, electron donors and
   degradation products present in these inputs, Parameter values used in
   the model are obtained from data acquired during typical site
   investigation and groundwater monitoring studies for natural attenuation
   schemes. The approach is evaluated for a UK Permo-Triassic Sandstone
   aquifer contaminated with a plume of phenolic compounds. Uncertainty in
   the model predictions and sensitivity to parameter values was assessed
   by probabilistic modelling using Monte Carlo methods. Sensitivity
   analyses were compared for different input parameter probability
   distributions and a base case using fixed parameter values, using an
   identical conceptual model and data set. Results show that consumption
   of oxidants by biodegradation is approximately balanced by the
   production of CH(4) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (TDIC) which is
   conserved in the plume. Under this condition, either the plume electron
   or carbon balance can be used to determine contaminant mass loss, which
   is equivalent to only 4\% of the estimated source term. This corresponds
   to a first order, plume-averaged, half-life of > 800 years. The electron
   balance is particularly sensitive to uncertainty in the source term and
   dispersive inputs. Reliable historical information on contaminant
   spillages and detailed site investigation are necessary to accurately
   characterise the source term. The dispersive influx is sensitive to
   variability in the plume mixing zone width. Consumption of aqueous
   oxidants greatly exceeds that of mineral oxidants in the plume, but
   electron acceptor supply is insufficient to meet the electron donor
   demand and the plume will grow. The aquifer potential for degradation of
   these contaminants is limited by high contaminant concentrations and the
   supply of bioavailable electron acceptors. Natural attenuation will
   increase only after increased transport and dilution. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Title = {{Processes controlling the distribution and natural attenuation of
   dissolved phenolic compounds in a deep sandstone aquifer}},

Abstract = {{Processes controlling the distribution and natural attenuation (NA) of
   phenol, cresols and xylenols released from a former coal-tar
   distillation plant in a deep Triassic sandstone aquifer are evaluated
   from vertical profiles along the plume centerline at 130 and 350 m from
   the site. Up to four groups of contaminants (phenols, mineral acids,
   NaOH, NaCl) form discrete and overlapping plumes in the aquifer. Their
   distribution reflects changing Source history with releases of
   contaminants from different locations. Organic contaminant distribution
   in the aquifer is determined more by site source history than
   degradation.
   Contaminant degradation at total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations up
   to 6500 mg l(-1) (7500 mg l(-1) total phenolics) is occurring by aerobic
   respiration NO3-reduction, Mn(IV)-/Fe(III)-reduction, SO4-reduction,
   methanogenesis and fermentation, with the accumulation of inorganic
   carbon, organic metabolites (4-hydroxybenzaidehyde, 4-hydroxybenzoic
   acid), acetate, Mn(II), Fe(II), S(-II), CH4 and H-2 in the plume.
   Aerobic and NO3-reducing processes are restricted to a 2-m-thick plume
   fringe but Mn(IV)-/Fe(III)-reduction, SO4-reduction, methanogenesis and
   fermentation occur concomitantly in the plume. Dissolved H-2
   concentrations in the plume vary from 0.7 to 110 nM and acetate
   concentrations reach 200 mg l(-1). The occurrence of a mixed redox
   system and concomitant terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs)
   could be explained with a partial equilibrium model based on the
   potential in situ free energy (AG,) yield for oxidation of H-2 by
   specific TEAPs. Respiratory processes rather than fermentation are rate
   limiting in determining the distribution of H-2 and TEAPs and H-2
   dynamics in this system. Most (min. 90\%) contaminant degradation has
   occurred by aerobic and NO3-reducing processes at the plume fringe. This
   potential is determined by the supply of aqueous O-2 and NO3 from
   uncontaminated groundwater. as controlled by transverse mixing, which is
   limited in this aquifer by low dispersion. Consumption to date of
   mineral oxides and SO4 is, respectively, <0.15\% and 0.4\% of the
   available aquifer capacity, and degradation using these oxidants is
   <10\%. Fermentation is a significant process in contaminant turnover,
   accounting for 21\% of degradation products present in the plume, and
   indicating that microbial respiration rates are slow in comparison with
   fermentation. Under present conditions, the potential for degradation in
   the plume is very low due to inhibitory effects of the contaminant
   matrix. Degradation products correspond to <22\% mass loss over the life
   of the plume, providing a first-order plume scale half-life > 140 years.
   The phenolic compounds are biodegradable under the range of redox
   conditions in the aquifer and the aquifer is not oxidant limited, but
   the plume is likely to be long-lived and to expand. Degradation is
   likely to increase only after contaminant concentrations are reduced and
   aqueous oxidant inputs are increased by dispersion of the plume. The
   results imply that transport processes may exert a greater control on
   the natural attenuation of this plume than aquifer oxidant availability.

Abstract = {{A range of bacteriological, geochemical process-related and molecular
   techniques have been used to assess the microbial biodegradative
   potential in groundwater contaminated with phenol and other tar acids.
   The contaminant plume has travelled 500 m from the pollutant source over
   several decades. Samples were obtained from the plume using a
   multi-level sampler (MLS) positioned in two boreholes (boreholes 59 and
   60) which vertically transected two areas of the plume. Activity of the
   microbial community, as represented by phenol degradation potential and
   ability to utilise a range of substrates, was found to be influenced by
   the plume. Phenol degradation potential appeared to be influenced more
   by the concentration of the contaminants than the total bacterial cell
   numbers. However, in the areas of highest phenol concentration, the
   depression of cell numbers clearly had an effect. The types of bacteria
   present were assessed by culture and DNA amplification by polymerase
   chain reaction (PCR). Bacterial groups or processes associated with
   major geochemical processes, such as methanogenesis, sulphate reduction
   and denitrification, that have the potential to drive contaminant
   degradation, were detected at various borehole levels. A comparative
   molecular analysis of the microbial community between samples obtained
   from the MLS revealed the microbial community was diverse. The
   examination of microbial activity complemented those results obtained
   through chemical analysis, and when combined with hydrological data,
   showed that MLS samples provided a realistic profile of plume effects
   and could be related to the potential for natural attenuation of the
   site. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A Triassic sandstone aquifer polluted with a mixture of phenolic
   hydrocarbons has been investigated by means of high-resolution
   groundwater sampling. Samples taken at depth intervals of 1 m have
   revealed the presence of a diving pollutant plume with a sharply defined
   upper margin. Concentrations of pollutant phenols exceed 4 g/l in the
   plume core, rendering it sterile but towards the diluted upper margin
   evidence for bacterial sulphate reduction (BSR) has been obtained.
   Groundwaters have been analysed for both delta S-34-SO4 and delta
   O-18-SO4. Two reservoirs have been identified with distinct
   sulphate-oxygen isotope ratios, Groundwater sulphate delta O-18-SO4=3-5
   parts per thousand) outside the plume shows a simple linear mixing trend
   with an isotopically uniform pollutant sulphate reservoir (delta
   O-18-SO4 = 10-12 parts per thousand) across the plume margin. The
   sulphur isotope ratios do not always obey a simple mixing relation,
   however, at one multilevel borehole, enrichment in (SO4)-S-34, at the
   plume margin is inversely correlated with sulphate concentration. This
   and the presence of S-34-depleted dissolved sulphide indicate that
   enrichment in (SO4)-S-34 is the result of bacterial sulphate reduction.
   delta S-34 analysis of trace hydrogen sulphide within the plume yielded
   an isotope enrichment factor (epsilon) of 9.4 parts per thousand for
   present-day bacterial sulphate reduction. This value agrees with a
   longterm estimate -9.9 parts per thousand) obtained from a Rayleigh
   model of the sulphate reduction process. The model was also used to
   obtain an estimate of the pre-reduction sulphate concentration profile
   with depth. The difference between this and the present-day profiles
   then gave a mass balance for sulphate consumption. The organic carbon
   mineralisation that would account for this sulphate loss is shown to
   represent only 0.1 parts per thousand of the phenol concentration in
   this region of the plume. Hence, the contribution of bacterial sulphate
   reduction to biodegradation has thus far been small. The highest total
   phenolic concentration (TPC) at which there is sulphur isotope evidence
   of bacterial sulphate reduction is 2000 mg/l. We suggest that above this
   concentration., the bactericidal properties of phenol render
   sulphate-reducing bacteria inactive. Dissolved sulphate trapped in the
   concentrated plume core will only be utilised by sulphate reducers when
   toxic phenols in the plume are diluted by dispersion during migration.

Abstract = {{A natural groundwater system modified by pollutant phenols and
   agricultural nitrate has been modelled in the laboratory by a series of
   sacrificial microcosm experiments. Samples of aquifer sediment and
   groundwater from the margin of the phenol plume were used to inoculate
   anaerobic microcosms enriched in nitrate and pollutant phenols. Rapid
   degradation of phenol and p-cresol was observed over a 35-day period
   leading to the generation of inorganic carbon and a number of transient
   intermediates. O-cresol proved to be recalcitrant on the experimental
   time-scale. A mass balance calculation shows that. during degradation,
   carbon was conserved in the aqueous phase. Groundwater-sediment
   interactions were monitored using carbon stable isotope data. A mass
   balance for solution TIC indicates that p-cresol degradation stimulated
   the dissolution of sedimentary carbonate phases due to the formation of
   carbonic acid. Coin pound-specific carbon isotope analysis (GC-IRMS) was
   used to search for C-13 enrichment in residual p-cresol. A slight
   enrichment trend (epsilon = - 2.5 parts per thousand) was tentatively
   identified. The potential of this fractionation effect for obtaining in
   situ degradation rates is discussed. Results from the microcosm
   experiments help to explain the observed distribution of nitrate and
   phenols within the polluted aquifer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Investigation of a groundwater plume containing up to 24 g l(-1)
   phenolic compounds suggested that over a period of nearly 50 years,
   little degradation had occurred despite the presence of a microbial
   community and electron acceptors within the core of the plume. In order
   to study the effect of contaminant concentration on degradation
   behaviour, laboratory microcosm experiments were performed under aerobic
   and anaerobic conditions at four different concentrations obtained by
   diluting contaminated with uncontaminated groundwater. The microcosms
   contained groundwater with total phenols at ca. 200, 250, 660 and 5000
   mg l(-1), and aquifer sediment that had been acclimatised within the
   plume for several months. The microcosms were operated for a period of
   390-400 days along with sterile controls to ascertain whether
   degradation was microbially mediated or abiotic. Under aerobic
   conditions, degradation only occurred at concentrations up to 660 mg
   l(-1) total phenols. At phenol concentrations below 250 mg l(-1), a
   benzoquinone intermediate, thought to originate from the degradation of
   2,5-dimethylphenol, was isolated and identified. This suggested an
   unusual degradative pathway for this compound; its aerobic degradation
   more commonly proceeding via catecholic intermediates. Under anaerobic
   conditions, degradation only occurred in the most dilute microcosm
   (total phenols 195 mg l(-1)) with a loss of p-cresol accompanied by a
   nonstoichiometric decrease in nitrate and sulphate. By inference,
   iron(III) from the sediment may also have been used as a terminal
   electron acceptor, in which case the amount of biologically available
   iron released was calculated as 1.07 mg Fe(III)/g of sediment. The study
   shows that natural attenuation is likely to be stimulated by dilution of
   the plume. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive solute transport modeling was utilized to evaluate the
   potential for natural attenuation of a contaminant plume containing
   phenolic compounds at a chemical producer in the West Midlands, UK. The
   reactive transport simulations consider microbially mediated
   biodegradation of the phenolic compounds (phenols, cresols, and
   xylenols) by multiple electron acceptors. Inorganic reactions including
   hydrolysis, aqueous complexation, dissolution of primary minerals,
   formation of secondary mineral phases, and ion exchange are considered.
   One-dimensional (ID) and three-dimensional (3D) simulations were
   conducted. Mass balance calculations indicate that biodegradation in the
   saturated zone has degraded approximately 1-5\% of the organic
   contaminant plume over a time period of 47 years. Simulations indicate
   that denitrification is the most significant degradation process,
   accounting for approximately 50\% of the organic contaminant removal,
   followed by sulfate reduction and fermentation reactions, each
   contributing 15-20\%. Aerobic respiration accounts for less than 10\% of
   the observed contaminant removal in the saturated zone. Although
   concentrations of Fc(III) and Mn(IV) mineral phases are high in the
   aquifer sediment, reductive dissolution is limited, producing only 5\%
   of the observed mass loss. Mass balance calculations suggest that no
   more than 20-25\% of the observed total inorganic carbon (TIC) was
   generated from biodegradation reactions in the saturated zone.
   Simulations indicate that aerobic biodegradation in the unsaturated
   zone, before the contaminant entered the aquifer, may have produced the
   majority of the TIC observed in the plume. Because long-term degradation
   is limited to processes within the saturated zone, use of observed TIC
   concentrations to predict the future natural attenuation may
   overestimate contaminant degradation by a factor of 4-5. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A 16-year study of a hydrocarbon plume shows that the extent of
   contaminant migration and compound-specific behavior have changed as
   redox reactions, most notably iron reduction, have progressed over time.
   Concentration changes at a small scale, determined from analysis of
   porewater samples drained from aquifer cores, are compared with
   concentration changes at the plume scale, determined from analysis of
   water samples from an observation well network. The small-scale data
   show clearly that the hydrocarbon plume is growing slowly as sediment
   iron oxides are depleted. Contaminants, such as ortho-xylene that
   appeared not to be moving downgradient from the oil on the basis of
   observation well data, are migrating in thin layers as the aquifer
   evolves to methanogenic conditions. However, the plume-scale observation
   well data show that the downgradient extent of the Fe2+ and BTEX plume
   did not change between 1992 and 1995. Instead, depletion of the unstable
   Fe (III) oxides near the subsurface crude-oil source has caused the
   maximum dissolved iron concentration zone within the plume to spread at
   a rate of approximately 3 m/year. The zone of maximum concentrations of
   benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) has also spread within
   the anoxic plume. In monitoring the remediation of
   hydrocarbon-contaminated ground water by natural attenuation, subtle
   concentration changes in observation well data from the anoxic zone may
   be diagnostic of depletion of the intrinsic electron-accepting capacity
   of the aquifer. Recognition of these subtle patterns may allow early
   prediction of growth of the hydrocarbon plume. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A multidisciplinary study of a crude-oil contaminated aquifer shows that
   the distribution of microbial physiologic types is strongly controlled
   by the aquifer properties and crude oil location. The microbial
   populations of four physiologic types were analyzed together with
   permeability, porewater chemistry, nonaqueous oil content, and
   extractable sediment iron. Microbial data from three vertical profiles
   through the anaerobic portion of the contaminated aquifer clearly show
   areas that have progressed from iron-reduction to methanogenesis. These
   locations contain lower numbers of iron reducers, and increased numbers
   of fermenters; with detectable methanogens. Methanogenic conditions
   exist both in the area contaminated by nonaqueous oil and also below the
   oil where high hydrocarbon concentrations correspond to local increases
   in aquifer permeability. The results indicate that high contaminant flux
   either from local dissolution or by advective transport plays a key role
   in determining which areas first become methanogenic. Other factors
   besides flux that are important include the sediment Fe(II) content and
   proximity to the water table. In locations near a seasonally oscillating
   water table, methanogenic conditions exist only below the lowest typical
   water table elevation. During 20 years since the oil spill occurred, a
   laterally continuous methanogenic zone has developed along a narrow
   horizon extending from the source area to 50-60 in downgradient. A
   companion paper {[}J. Contain. Hydrol. 53, 369-386] documents how the
   growth of the methanogenic zone results in expansion of the aquifer
   volume contaminated with the highest concentrations of benzene, toluene.

Abstract = {{The changing contaminant pattern with travelled distance was
   investigated in the anaerobic groundwater plume downstream from an
   extended zone containing residual NAPL at a former gas manufacturing
   plant. With increasing distance, O- and N-heterocyclic aromatic
   compounds are enriched in the plume relative to the usually assessed
   coal tar constituents (poly- and monocyclic aromatic compounds). In a
   first approximation, the overall concentration decrease of the
   investigated compounds follows a first order overall decay, The half
   life distance in the plume downgradient from the source varied between
   20 m for benzene and up to 167-303 m for alkyl-naphthalenes.
   Acenaphthene is degraded only within about 50 m downstream from the
   source area, then its concentration remains constant (ca. 180 mug/l) and
   far above the legal limit. Dimethyl-benzofurans were the most
   recalcitrant among all compounds which could be quantified with the
   analytical method available. The overall groundwater contamination in
   the plume is seriously underestimated if only BTEX and 16-EPA-PAHs are
   monitored. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new integral groundwater investigation approach was used for the first
   time to quantify natural attenuation rates at field scale. In this
   approach, pumping wells positioned along two control planes were
   operated at distances of 140 and 280 m downstream of a contaminant
   source zone at a former gasworks site polluted with BTEX- (benzene,
   toluene, ethyl-benzene. o-, p-xylene) and PAH- (polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons) compounds. Based on the quantified changes in total
   contaminant mass fluxes between the control planes, first-order natural
   attenuation rate constants could be estimated. For BTEX-compounds, these
   ranged from 1.4e - 02 to 1.3e - 01 day(-1) whereas for PAH-compounds
   natural attenuation rate constants of 3.7e - 04 to 3.1e - 02 day(-1)
   were observed. Microbial degradation activity at the site was indicated
   by an increase in dissolved iron mass flux and a reduction in sulphate
   mass flux between the two investigated control planes. In addition to
   information about total contaminant mass fluxes and average
   concentrations, an analysis of the concentration-time series measured at
   the control planes also allowed to semi-quantitatively delineate the
   aquifer regions most likely contaminated by the BTEX- and PAH-compounds.

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to compare three techniques to measure the
   air permeability of the unsaturated zone at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ and to
   examine the effects of moisture content and soil heterogeneity on air
   permeability. Air permeability was measured in three ways: laboratory
   experiments on intact soil cores, field-scale air pump tests and
   calibration of air permeability to air pressures measured in the field
   under natural air pressure conditions using a numerical airflow model.
   The results obtained from these three methods were compared and found to
   be similar. Laboratory experiments performed on intact cores measured
   air permeability values on the order of 10(-14) to 10(-9) m(2).
   Low-permeability cores were found between land surface and a depth of
   0.6 m. The soil core data were divided into two layers with composite
   vertical permeability values of 1.3 X 10(-13) m(2) from land surface to
   a 0.6-m depth and 3.8 X 10(-10) m(2) for the lower layer. Analyses of
   the field-scale pump tests were performed for two scenarios: one in
   which the entire unsaturated zone was open to the atmosphere and one
   assuming a cap of low permeability extending 0.6 m below land surface.
   The vertical air permeability values obtained for the open scenario
   ranged from 1.2 X 10(-9) to 1.5 X 10(-9) m(2), and ranged from 3.6 X
   10(-9) to 6.8 X 10(-9) m(2) in the lower layer, assuming an upper cap
   permeability of 6.0 X 10(-14) m(2). The results from the open scenario
   are much higher than expected and the possible reasons for this
   ambiguity are discussed. The results from the capped scenario matched
   closely with those from the other methods and indicated that it is
   important to have background information on the study site to correctly
   analyze the pump test data. The optimized fit of the natural subsurface
   air pressure was achieved with an intrinsic permeability value of 3.3 X
   10(-14) m(2). When the data were refitted to the model assuming two
   distinct layers of the unsaturated zone, the optimized fit was achieved
   with intrinsic air permeabilities of 1.6 X 10(-14) m(2) for the upper,
   low-permeability region and 8.4 X 10(-9) m(2) for the lower region.
   Vertical air-permeability predictions from the three methods are similar
   provided that soil cores are collected from all representative depths to
   account for heterogeneous layers and that the correct assumptions are
   made when analyzing field-scale pump test data. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper, analytical solutions are derived for a one-dimensional
   scale-dependent dispersion model (SDM), considering linear equilibrium
   sorption and first-order degradation for continuous and pulse
   contaminant sources, with a constant input concentration in a
   semi-infinite uniform porous medium. In the SDM model, dispersivity
   alpha (x) is replaced with a constant epsilon multiplied by the
   transport distance x. The solution for a pulse source is verified
   experimentally in the analysis of tritium data obtained from an 8-m-long
   homogenous pea-gravel column with multiple sampling locations, and the
   results are compared with those analysed by a commonly used solution of
   a constant dispersion model (CDM). The SDM predicts concentrations
   satisfactorily at all sampling locations, while the CDM fits the
   experimental data well for only one location. Both models are then
   calibrated for each individual concentration breakthrough curve, using
   local values for either epsilon in the SDM or alpha (x) in the CDM. Both
   models give equally good fits for appropriate choices of individuals
   epsilon and alpha (x) values, and both indicate a linear increase in
   alpha (x), with distance. The epsilon values tend to change little as x
   increases and are expected to approach a constant at relatively large
   distances downstream. Hence, predictions from the SDM should become more
   accurate as x increases. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Analytical study of contaminant transport from a finite source in a
   finite-thickness aquifer is most useful in hydrological and
   environmental sciences and engineering but rarely investigated in
   previous studies. This paper provides analytical solutions of
   contaminant transport from one-, two-, and three-dimensional finite
   sources in a finite-thickness aquifer using Green's function method. A
   library of unpublished analytical solutions with different finite source
   geometry is provided. A graphically integrated MATLAB((R)) script is
   developed to calculate the temporal integrations in the analytical
   solutions and obtain the final solutions of concentration. The
   analytical solutions are examined by reproducing the solutions of some
   special cases discussed in previous studies. The sensitivities of the
   line source solutions to source geometry, dispersion coefficients, and
   distance to the source are tested. The contaminant concentration in the
   near field is found to be sensitive to the source geometry and
   anisotropy of the dispersion coefficients. The contaminant concentration
   in the far field is found to be much less sensitive to the source
   geometry. The physical insights of the analytical solutions are
   interpreted. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the potential effects of coupled transport phenomena on
   radionuclide transport in the vicinity of a repository for vitrified
   high-level radioactive waste (HLW) and spent nuclear fuel (SF) hosted by
   the Opalinus Clay in Switzerland, at times equal to or greater than the
   expected lifetime of the waste canisters (about 1000 years), are
   addressed. The solute fluxes associated with advection, chemical
   diffusion, thermal and chemical osmosis, hyperfiltration and thermal
   diffusion have been incorporated into a simple one-dimensional transport
   equation. The analytical solution of this equation, with appropriate
   parameters, shows that thermal osmosis is the only coupled transport
   mechanism that could, on its own, have a strong effect on repository
   performance. Based on the results from the analytical model,
   two-dimensional finite-difference models incorporating advection and
   thermal osmosis, and taking conservation of fluid mass into account,
   have been formulated. The results show that, under the conditions in the
   vicinity of the repository at the time scales of interest. and due to
   the constraints imposed by conservation of fluid mass, the advective
   component of flow will oppose and cancel the thermal-osmotic component.
   The overall conclusion is that coupled phenomena wilt only have a very
   minor impact on radionuclide transport in the Opalinus Clay, in terms or
   fluid and solute fluxes, at least under the conditions prevailing at
   times equal to or greater than the expected lifetime of the waste
   canisters (about 1000 years). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Matrix diffusion is an important transport process in geologic materials
   of low hydraulic conductivity. For predicting the fate and transport of
   contaminants, a detailed understanding of the diffusion processes in
   natural porous media is essential. In this study, diffusive tracer
   transport (iodide) was investigated in a variety of geologically
   different limestone and sandstone rocks. Porosity, structural and
   mineralogical composition, hydraulic conductivity, and other rock
   properties were determined. The effective diffusion coefficients were
   measured using the time-lag method. The results of the diffusion
   experiments indicate that there is a close relationship between total
   porosity and the effective diffusion coefficient of a rock (analogous to
   Archie's Law). Consequently, the tortousity factor can be expressed as a
   function of total porosity. The relationship fits best for thicker
   samples ( > 1.0 cm) with high porosities ( > 20\%). because of the
   reduced influence of heterogeneity in larger samples. In general, these
   correlations appear to be a simple way to determine tortuosity and the
   effective diffusion coefficient from easy to determine rock porosity
   values. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The persistence and penetration of the herbicides isoproturon and
   chlorotoluron in an unconfined chalk aquifer has been monitored over a
   4-year period through soil sampling, shallow coring and groundwater
   monitoring. Chlorotoluron was applied on plots as a marker compound,
   having never been used previously on that, or surrounding fields. The
   fieldsite had a 5 degrees slope with soil depths of 0.5 to 1.5 m and a
   water table between 20 and 5 m from the soil surface. Where the water
   table was deepest (9-20 m below surface (mbs)) little or no positive
   herbicide detections were made. However, where the water table was at
   only 4-5 mbs, a regular pesticide signal of around 0.1 mug/l for
   isoproturon and chlorotoluron could be distinguished. Over the winter
   recharge period automatic borehole samplers revealed a series of
   short-lived peaks of isoproturon and chlorotoluron reaching up to 0.8
   mug/l. This is consistent with a preferential flow mechanism operating
   at this particular part of the field. Such peaks were occurring over 2
   years after the last application of these compounds. Shallow coring
   failed to uncover any significant pesticide pulse moving through the
   deep unsaturated zone matrix at the fieldsite. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Nitrate in drinking water is a hazard to both humans and animals.
   Contaminated water can cause methemoglobinemia and may pose a cancer
   risk. Permeable barriers containing innocuous oils, which stimulate
   denitrification, can remove nitrate from flowing groundwater. For this
   study, a sand tank (1.1 x 2.0 x 0.085 to in size) containing sand was
   used as a one-dimensional open-top scale model of an aquifer. A
   meter-long area near the center of the tank contained sand coated with
   soybean oil. This region served as a permeable denitrifying barrier.
   Water containing 20 mg l(-1) nitrate-N was pumped through the barrier at
   a high flow rate, 11121 week(-1), for 30 weeks. During the 30-week
   study, the barrier removed 39\% of the total nitrate-N present in the
   water. The barrier was most efficient during the first 10 weeks of the
   study when almost all of the nitrate and nitrogen was removed.
   Efficiency declined with time so that by week 30 almost no nitrate was
   removed by the system. Nitrite levels in the effluent water remained low
   throughout the study. Barriers could be used to protect groundwater from
   nitrate contamination or for the in situ treatment of contaminated
   water. At the low flow rates that exist in most aquifers, such barriers
   should be effective at removing nitrate from groundwater for a much
   longer period of time. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a physical modelling study outlining a technique
   whereby buoyant contaminant flow within water-saturated unconsolidated
   sand was remotely monitored utilizing the time-lapse 3-D (TL3-D) seismic
   response. The controlled temperature and pressure conditions, along with
   the high level of acquisition repeatability attainable using sandbox
   physical models, allow the TL3-D seismic response to pore fluid movement
   to be distinguished from all other effects. TL3-D seismic techniques are
   currently being developed to monitor hydrocarbon reserves within
   producing reservoirs in an endeavour to improve overall recovery.
   However, in many ways, sandbox models under atmospheric conditions more
   accurately simulate the shallow subsurface than petroleum reservoirs.
   For this reason, perhaps the greatest application for analogue sandbox
   modelling is to improve our understanding of shallow groundwater and
   environmental flow mechanisms.
   Two fluid flow simulations were conducted whereby air and kerosene were
   injected into separate water-saturated unconsolidated sand models. In
   both experiments, a base 3-D seismic volume was recorded and compared
   with six later monitor surveys recorded while the injection program was
   conducted. Normal incidence amplitude and P-wave velocity information
   were extracted from the TL3-D seismic data to provide visualization of
   contaminant migration.
   Reflection amplitudes displayed qualitative areal distribution of fluids
   when a suitable impedance contrast existed between pore fluids. TL3-D
   seismic reflection tomography can potentially monitor the change in
   areal distribution of fluid contaminants over time, indicating flow
   patterns. However. other research and this current work have not
   established a quantifiable relationship between either normal reflection
   amplitudes and attenuation and fluid saturation. Generally, different
   pore fluids will have unique seismic velocities due to differences in
   compressibility and density. The predictable relationships that exist
   between P-wave velocity and fluid saturation can allow a quantitative
   assessment of contaminant migration. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Several previously reported laboratory studies related to transport of
   solutes through packed columns were utilized to develop predictive
   relationships for mass-transfer rate coefficient. The data were
   classified into two groups: those obtained under rate-limited mass
   transfer between mobile and immobile water regions (physical
   nonequilibrium conditions), and those derived from rate-limited mass
   transfer between instantaneous and slow sorption sites (sorption
   nonequilibrium conditions). The mass-transfer coefficient in all these
   studies was obtained by fitting breakthrough data to a transport model
   employing a first-order rate limitations with a ``constant{''}
   mass-transfer coefficient, independent of flow conditions. This study
   demonstrated that the mass-transfer coefficient in these models is
   dependent on system parameters including pore-water velocity,
   length-scale, retardation coefficient, and particle or aggregate size.
   Predictive relationships were developed, through regression analysis.
   relating mass-transfer coefficient to residence time. The developed
   relationships adequately estimated previously reported field
   mass-transfer values. Successful simulations of field desorption data
   reported by Bahr {[}J. Contain. Hydrol. 4 (1989) 205] further
   demonstrate the potential applicability of the developed relationships.

Abstract = {{The input variables for a numerical model of reactive solute transport
   in groundwater include both transport parameters, such as hydraulic
   conductivity and infiltration, and reaction parameters that describe the
   important chemical and biological processes in the system. These
   parameters are subject to uncertainty due to measurement error and due
   to the spatial variability of properties in the subsurface environment.
   This paper compares the relative effects of uncertainty in the transport
   and reaction parameters on the results of a solute transport model. This
   question is addressed by comparing the magnitudes of the local
   sensitivity coefficients for transport and reaction parameters. General
   sensitivity equations are presented for transport parameters, reaction
   parameters, and the initial (background) concentrations in the problem
   domain. Parameter sensitivity coefficients are then calculated for an
   example problem in which uranium(VI) hydrolysis species are transported
   through a two-dimensional domain with a spatially variable pattern of
   surface complexation sites. In this example, the reaction model includes
   equilibrium speciation reactions and mass transfer-limited
   non-electrostatic surface complexation reactions. The set of parameters
   to which the model is most sensitive includes the initial concentration
   of one of the surface sites, the formation constant (Kr) of one of the
   surface complexes and the hydraulic conductivity within the reactive
   zone. For this example problem, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates
   that transport and reaction parameters are, equally important in terms
   of how their variability affects the model results. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One of the most common methods to dispose of domestic wastewater
   involves the release of septic effluent from drains located in the
   unsaturated zone. Nitrogen from such systems is currently of concern
   because of nitrate contamination of drinking water supplies and
   eutrophication of coastal waters. It has been proposed that adding
   labile carbon sources to septic distribution fields could enhance
   heterotrophic denitrification and thus reduce nitrate concentrations in
   shallow groundwater. In this study, a numerical model which solves for
   variably saturated flow and reactive transport of multiple species is
   employed to investigate the performance of a drain field design that
   incorporates a fine-grained denitrification layer. The hydrogeological
   scenario simulated is an unconfined sand aquifer. The model results
   suggest that the denitrification layer, supplemented with labile organic
   carbon, may be an effective means to eliminate nitrogen loading to
   shallow groundwater. It is also shown that in noncalcareous. aquifers,
   the denitrification reaction may provide sufficient buffering capacity
   to maintain near neutral pH conditions beneath and down gradient of the
   drain field. Leaching of excess dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the
   denitrification layer is problematic, and causes an anaerobic plume to
   develop in simulations where the water table is less than 5-6 m below
   ground surface; this anaerobic plume may lead to other down gradient
   changes in groundwater quality. A drain field and denitrification layer
   of smaller dimensions is shown to be just as effective for reducing
   nitrate, but has the benefit of reducing the excess DOC leached from the
   layer. This configuration will minimize the impact of wastewater
   disposal in areas where the water table is as shallow as 3.5 in. (C)

Abstract = {{The aquifer beneath an abandoned refinery in the Lower Rhine area,
   Germany, was contaminated with a number of different mineral oil
   products. Groundwater sampling in the area around the former xylene
   plant revealed that a xylene plume had developed in the underlying
   groundwater, and moreover, that there is strong evidence for in situ
   microbial xylene degradation with oxygen, nitrate, sulfate and ferric
   iron as electron acceptors. In order to prevent further xylene
   spreading, three pumping wells extracting contaminated water were
   installed downgradient of the spill zone. The numerical reactive
   transport code Transport Biochemisty Chemistry (TBC) was applied to this
   situation to quantify the relation of microbial degradation to xylene
   removal by the pumping wells. It could be shown that the unamended in
   situ degradation was an appreciable xylene removal process that
   contributed to about one-third to the total xylene removal (degradation
   plus extraction). A further objective of the model application was to
   predict xylene spreading under regional flow conditions, i.e. without
   operation of the three pumping wells, to consider the possible effects
   of natural xylene attenuation. To accomplish this, the model calibrated
   for the situation with operating wells was transferred to the hydraulic
   situation of regional flow while retaining the parameters of the
   biochemical model. It turned out that the xylene plume that is expected
   to develop downgradient of the source area will be limited to an
   extension of not more than 1000 in. An interesting feature of the
   simulations results was that xylene degradation under iron-reducing
   conditions, which was of minor importance for the situation with
   operating pumping wells, becomes the dominant degradation mechanism
   under regional flow conditions. Moreover, iron reduction will be the key
   process in controlling plume evolution. The model application
   illustrates that multi-species reactive transport models are needed to
   adequately transfer reactive processes from one hydraulic situation to
   another, while single species models are not suited for this predictive
   task. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural attenuation of an acidic plume in the aquifer underneath a
   uranium mill tailings pond in Wyoming, USA was simulated using the
   multi-component reactive transport code PHREEQC. A one-dimensional model
   was constructed for the site and the model included advective-dispersive
   transport, aqueous speciation of li components, and
   precipitation-dissolution of six minerals. Transport simulation was
   performed for a reclamation scenario in which the source of acidic
   seepage will be terminated after 5 years and the plume will then be
   flushed by uncontaminated upgradient groundwater. Simulations show that
   successive pH buffer reactions with calcite, Al(OH)(3)(a), and
   Fe(OH)(3)(a) create distinct geochemical zones and most reactions occur
   at the boundaries of geochemical zones. The complex interplay of
   physical transport processes and chemical reactions produce multiple
   concentration waves. For SO42- transport, the concentration waves are
   related to advection-dispersion, and gypsum precipitation and
   dissolution. Wave speeds from numerical simulations compare well to an
   analytical solution for wave propagation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{A newly developed reactive transport model was used to evaluate the
   potential effects of mine closure on the geochemical evolution in the
   aquifer downgradient from a mine site. The simulations were conducted
   for the Konigstein uranium mine located in Saxony, Germany. During
   decades of operation, uranium at the former mine site had been extracted
   by in situ acid leaching of the ore underground, while the mine was
   maintained in a dewatered condition. One option for decommissioning is
   to allow the groundwater level to rise to its natural level, flooding
   the mine workings. As a result, pore water containing high
   concentrations of dissolved metals, radionuclides, and sulfate may be
   released. Additional contamination may arise due to the dissolution of
   minerals contained in the aquifer downgradient of the mine. On the other
   hand, dissolved metals may be attenuated by reactions within the
   aquifer. The geochemical processes and interactions involved are highly
   non-linear and their impact on the quality of the groundwater and
   surface water downstream of the mine is not always intuitive. The
   multicomponent reactive transport model MIN3P, which can describe
   mineral dissolution-precipitation reactions, aqueous complexation, and
   oxidation-reduction reactions, is shown to be a powerful tool for
   investigating these processes. The predictive capabilities of the model
   are, however, limited by the availability of key Geochemical parameters
   such as the presence and quantities of primary and secondary mineral
   phases. Under these conditions, the model can provide valuable insight
   by means of sensitivity analyses. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Acid mine drainage (AMD) results from the oxidation of sulfides, mainly
   pyrite, present in mine wastes, either mill tailings or waste rock. This
   is the first of two papers describing the coupled physical processes
   taking place in waste rock piles undergoing AMD production. Since the
   oxidation of pyrite involves the consumption of oxygen and the
   production of heat, the oxidation process initiates coupled processes of
   gas transfer by diffusion and convection as well as heat transfer. These
   processes influence the supply of oxygen that is required to sustain the
   oxidation process. This first paper describes a general conceptual model
   of the interaction of these coupled transfer processes. This general
   conceptual model is illustrated by the physicochemical conditions
   observed at two large sites where extensive characterization programs
   revealed widely different properties. The South Dump of the Doyon mine
   in Canada is permeable and has a high pyrite oxidation rate leading to
   high temperatures (over 65 degreesC), thus making temperature-driven air
   convection the main oxygen supply mechanism. The Nordhalde of the
   Ronnenberg mining district in Germany contains lower permeability
   material which is less reactive, thus leading to a more balanced
   contribution of gaseous diffusion and convection as oxygen supply
   mechanisms. The field characterization and monitoring data at these
   sites were thoroughly analyzed to yield two coherent sets of
   representative physical properties. These properties are used in the
   second paper as a basis for a plications of numerical simulation in
   AMD-producing waste rock piles. (C) 2001 p Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Landfill gas, originating from the anaerobic biodegradation of the
   organic content of waste, consists mainly of methane and carbon dioxide,
   with traces of volatile organic compounds. Pressure, concentration and
   temperature gradients that develop within the landfill result in gas
   emissions to the atmosphere and in lateral migration through the
   surrounding soils. Environmental and safety issues associated with the
   landfill gas require control of off-site gas migration. The numerical
   model TOUGH2-LGM (Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat-Landfill
   Gas Migration) has been developed to simulate landfill gas production
   and migration processes within and beyond landfill boundaries. The model
   is derived from the general non-isothermal multiphase. flow simulator
   TOUGH2, to which a new equation of state module is added. It simulates
   the migration of five components in partially saturated media: four
   fluid components (water, atmospheric air, methane and carbon dioxide)
   and one energy component (heat). The four fluid components are present
   in both the gas and liquid phases. The model incorporates gas-liquid
   partitioning of all fluid components by means of dissolution and
   volatilization. In addition to advection in the gas and liquid phase,
   multi-component diffusion is simulated in the gas phase. The landfill
   gas production rate is proportional to the organic substrate and is
   modeled as an exponentially decreasing function of time. The model is
   applied to the Montreal's CESM landfill site, which is located in a
   former limestone rock quarry. Existing data were used to characterize
   hydraulic properties of the waste and the limestone. Gas recovery data
   at the site were used to define the gas production model. Simulations in
   one and two dimensions are presented to investigate gas production and
   migration in the landfill, and in the surrounding limestone. The effects
   of a gas recovery well and landfill cover on gas mi.-ration are also
   discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of colloid transport in discretely fractured
   porous media were performed to investigate the importance of matrix
   diffusion of colloids as well as the filtration and remobilization of
   colloidal particles in both the fractures and porous matrix. To achieve
   this objective a finite element numerical code entitled COLDIFF was
   developed. The processes that COLDIFF takes into account include
   advective-dispersive transport of colloids, filtration and
   remobilization of colloidal particles in both fractures and porous
   matrix, and diffusive interactions of colloids between the fractures and
   porous matrix. Three sets of simulations were conducted to examine the
   importance of parameters and processes controlling colloid migration.
   First, a sensitivity analysis was performed using a porous block
   containing a single fracture to determine the relative importance of
   various phenomenological coefficients on colloid transport. The primary
   result of the analysis showed that the porosity of the matrix and the
   process of colloid filtration in fractures play important roles in
   controlling colloid migration. Second, simulations were performed to
   replicate and examine the results of a laboratory column study using a
   fractured shale saprolite. Results of this analysis showed that the
   filtration of colloidal particles in the porous matrix can greatly
   affect the tailing of colloid concentrations after the colloid source
   was removed. Finally, field-scale simulations were performed to examine
   the effect of matrix porosity, fracture filtration and fracture
   remobilization on long-term colloid concentration and migration
   distance. The field scale simulations indicated that matrix diffusion
   and fracture filtration can significantly reduce colloid migration
   distance. Results of all three analyses indicated that in environments
   where porosity is relatively high and colloidal particles are small
   enough to diffuse out of fractures, the characteristics of the porous
   matrix that affect colloid transport become more important than those of
   the fracture network. Because the properties of the fracture network
   tend to have greater uncertainty due to difficulties in their
   measurement relative to those of the porous matrix, prediction
   uncertainties associated with colloid transport in discretely fractured
   porous media may be reduced. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In certain hydrogeological situations, fluid density variations occur
   because of changes in the solute or colloidal concentration,
   temperature, and pressure of the groundwater. These include seawater
   intrusion, high-level radioactive waste disposal, groundwater
   contamination, and geothermal energy production. When the density of the
   invading fluid is greater than that of the ambient one, density-driven
   free convection can lead to transport of heat and solutes over larger
   spatial scales and significantly shorter time scales than compared with
   diffusion alone. Beginning with the work of Lord Rayleigh in 1916,
   thermal and solute instabilities in homogeneous media have been studied
   in detail for almost a century. Recently, these theoretical and
   experimental studies have been applied in the study of groundwater
   phenomena, where the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy rarely, if
   ever, apply. The critical role that heterogeneity plays in the onset as
   well as the growth and/or decay of convective motion is discussed by way
   of a review of pertinent literature and numerical simulations performed
   using a variable-density flow and solute transport numerical code.
   Different styles of heterogeneity are considered and range from
   continuously ``trending{''} heterogeneity (sinusoidal and stochastic
   permeability distributions) to discretely fractured geologic media.
   Results indicate that both the onset of instabilities and their
   subsequent growth and decay are intimately related to the structure and
   variance of the permeability field. While disordered heterogeneity tends
   to dissipate convection through dispersive mixing, an ordered
   heterogeneity (e.g., sets of vertical fractures) allows instabilities to
   propagate at modest combinations of fracture aperture and separation
   distances. Despite a clearer understanding of the processes that control
   the onset and propagation of instabilities, resultant plume patterns and
   their migration rates and pathways do not appear amenable to prediction
   at present. The classical Rayleigh number used to predict the occurrence
   of instabilities fails, in most cases, when heterogeneous conditions
   prevail. The incorporation of key characteristics of the heterogeneous
   permeability field into relevant stability criteria and numerical models
   remains a challenge for future research. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Rapid movement of agricultural chemicals through soil to groundwater via
   preferential flow pathways is one cause of water contamination. Previous
   studies have shown that time domain reflectometry (TDR) could be used to
   characterize solute transport in soil. However, previous studies have
   only scarcely addressed preferential flow. This study presents an
   extended application of TDR for determining preferential flow
   properties. A TDR method was tested in carefully controlled laboratory
   experiments using 20-cm long and 12-cm diameter undisturbed, structured
   soil columns. The method used a vertically installed TDR probe and a
   short pulse of tracer application to obtain residual mass (RM)
   breakthrough curves (BTC). The RM BTC obtained from TDR were used to
   estimate mobile/immobile model (MIM) parameters that were compared to
   the parameter estimates from effluent data. A conventional inverse curve
   fitting method (CXTFIT) was used to estimate parameters. The
   TDR-determined parameters were then used to generate calculated effluent
   BTC for comparison with observed effluent BTC for the same soil columns.
   Time moments of the calculated and observed BTC were calculated to
   quantitatively evaluate the calculated BTC. Overall, the RM BTC obtained
   from TDR were similar to the RM BTC obtained from effluent data. The
   TDR-determined parameters corresponded well to the parameters obtained
   from the effluent data, although they were not within the 95\%
   confidence intervals. Correlation coefficients between the parameters
   obtained from TDR and from effluent data for the immobile water fraction
   (theta (im)/theta), mass exchange coefficient (alpha), and dispersion
   coefficient (D-m) were 0.95, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively. For three of
   the four soil cores, theta (im)/theta ranged from 0.42 to 0.82,
   indicating considerable preferential flow. The TDR-calculated effluent
   BTC also were similar to the observed effluent BTC having an average
   coefficient of determination of 0.94. Time moments obtained from
   calculated BTC were representative of those obtained from observed BTC.
   The vertical TDR probe method was simple and minimally destructive and
   provided representative preferential flow properties that enabled the
   characterization of solute transport in soil. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Mineralogical compositions and their spatial distributions are important
   initial conditions for reactive transport modeling. However, popular
   K-d-based ``reactive{''} transport models only require contaminant
   concentrations in the pore fluids as initial conditions, and minerals
   implicitly represent infinite sources and sinks in these models. That
   situation results in a general neglect of mineralogical characterization
   in site investigations. This study uses a coupled multi-component
   reactive mass transport model to predict the natural attenuation of a
   ground water plume at a uranium mill tailings site in western USA.
   Numerous ground water geochemistry data are available at this site, but
   mineralogical data are sketchy. Even given the well-defined pore fluid
   chemistry, variations of secondary mineral species and mineral
   abundances in the aquifer resulted in significantly different modeling
   outcomes. Results show that the amount of calcite in the aquifer
   determines the distances of plume migration. The possible presence of
   jurbanite, an aluminum sulfate phase, can store acidity temporarily but
   cause more severe contamination on a later date. The surfaces of iron
   oxyhydroxides can store significant amounts of sulfate and protons and
   serve as a second source for prolonged contamination. These simulations
   under field conditions illustrate that mineralogical compositions are an
   essential requirement for accurate prediction of contaminant fate and
   transport. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In January 1999, wastewater influent and effluent from the pretreatment
   plant at the String-fellow hazardous waste disposal site were sampled
   along with groundwater at six locations along the groundwater
   contaminant plume. The objectives of this sampling and study were to
   identify at the compound class level the unidentified 40-60\% of
   wastewater organic contaminants, and to determine what organic compound
   classes were being removed by the wastewater pretreatment plant, and
   what organic compound classes persisted during subsurface waste
   migration. The unidentified organic wastes are primarily chlorinated
   aromatic sulfonic acids derived from wastes from DDT manufacture. Trace
   amounts of EDTA and NTA organic complexing agents were discovered along
   with carboxylate metabolites of the common alkylphenolpolyethoxylate
   plasticizers and nonionic surfactants. The wastewater pretreatment plant
   removed most of the aromatic chlorinated sulfonic acids that have
   hydrophobic neutral properties, but the p-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid
   which is the primary waste constituent passed through the pretreatment
   plant and was discharged in the treated wastewaters transported to an
   industrial sewer. During migration in groundwater,
   p-chlorobenzenesulfonic acid is removed by natural remediation
   processes. Wastewater organic contaminants have decreased 3- to 45-fold
   in the groundwater from 1985 to 1999 as a result of site remediation and
   natural remediation processes. The chlorinated aromatic sulfonic acids
   with hydrophobic neutral properties persist and have migrated into
   groundwater that underlies the adjacent residential community. Published

Abstract = {{Anaerobic microbial activities such as sulfate reduction are important
   for the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) in contaminated
   aquifers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of
   single-well push-pull tests in combination with stable sulfur isotope
   analyses for the in situ quantification of microbial sulfate reduction.
   A series of push-pull tests was performed in an existing monitoring well
   of a PHC-contaminated aquifer in Studen (Switzerland). Sulfate transport
   behavior was evaluated in a first test. In three subsequent tests, we
   injected anoxic test solutions (up to 1000 1), which contained 0.5 mM
   bromide (Br-) as conservative tracer and 1 mM sulfate (SO42-) as
   reactant. After an initial incubation period of 42.5 to 67.9 h, up to
   1100 1 of test solution/groundwater mixture was extracted in each test
   from the same location. During the extraction phases, we measured
   concentrations of relevant species including, Br-, SO42- and sulfide
   (S(-II)), as well as stable sulfur isotope ratios (delta S-34) of
   extracted, unconsumed SO42-, and extracted S(-II). Results indicated
   sulfate reduction activity in the vicinity of the test well. Computed
   first-order rate coefficients for sulfate reduction ranged from 0.043
   +/- 0.013 to 0. 130 +/- 0.015 day Isotope enrichment factors (epsilon)
   computed from sulfur isotope fractionation of extracted, unconsumed
   SO42- ranged from 20.2 +/- 5.5 parts per thousand to 22.8 +/- 3.4 parts
   per thousand. To-ether with observed fractionation in extracted S(-II),
   isotope enrichment factors provided strong evidence for microbially
   mediated sulfate reduction. Thus, push-pull tests combined with stable
   sulfur isotope analyses proved useful for the in situ quantification of
   microbial sulfate reduction in a PHC-contaminated aquifer. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional transport model for simulating water flow and solute
   transport in homogeneous-heterogeneous, saturated-unsaturated porous
   media is presented. The model is composed of a combination of accurate
   numerical algorithms for solving the nonlinear Richard's and
   advection-dispersion equations (ADE). The mixed form of Richard's
   equation is solved using a standard finite element method (FEM) with
   primary variable switching. The transport equation is solved using
   operator splitting, with the discontinuous finite element method (DFE)
   for discretization of the advective term. A slope limiting procedure for
   DFE avoids numerical instabilities but creates very limited numerical
   dispersion for high Peclet numbers. An implicit finite differences
   scheme (FD) is used for the dispersive term.
   The unsaturated flow and transport model (Wamos-T) is applied to a
   variety of rigorous problems including transient flow, heterogeneous
   medium and abrupt variations of velocity in magnitude and direction due
   to time-varying boundary conditions. It produces accurate and
   mass-conservative solutions for a very large range of grid Peclet
   numbers. The Wamos-T model is a good and robust alternative for the
   simulation of mass transport in unsaturated domain. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the context of municipal solid waste and hazardous waste disposal,
   the notion of ``equivalence{''} between different barrier designs
   appears in regulatory documents from several industrialized countries.
   While in the past, equivalence has been thought of mainly in terms of
   contaminant travel times, in recent years it has been defined more in
   terms of the magnitude of a disposal site's potential impact on
   groundwater resources. This paper presents some original analytical
   solutions to the problem of contaminant migration through a
   multi-layered mineral barrier. The solutions account for the two major
   mechanisms of subsurface contaminant migration, namely, advection and
   diffusion-dispersion. An example application using the proposed
   solutions and a numerical model illustrates how one multi-layered
   mineral barrier can be considered superior to another from a strictly
   hydro-dispersive viewpoint. The influence of partial saturation of the
   mineral barrier is investigated using a numerical solution to the
   Richards equation for unsaturated flow. It is emphasized that
   conclusions relative to the superiority of one multi-layered barrier,
   with respect to another, should not only consider hydro-dispersive
   aspects, but also other processes such as the mechanical and chemical
   evolutions of the different barrier components. Although such phenomena
   are poorly addressed by existing models, failure to take them into
   account, at least in a qualitative fashion, may lead to unconservative
   conclusions with respect to barrier equivalence. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This study investigates the influence of fluctuating toluene
   concentrations on aerobic toluene degradation in a sandy porous medium
   colonized with Ralstonia pickettii PKO1. Column effluent toluene
   concentrations were found to increase after a temporary decrease in
   influent toluene concentration. Subsequent examination of the spatial
   gradient of toluene degradative activity in the column suggested that
   the observed increase in effluent toluene concentrations was
   attributable to an adverse effect of toluene limitation on the
   biodegradative activity of attached cells. The ;traditional
   Michaelis-Menten-type biodegradation equation associated with
   batch-measured V-max (2.26 mg(toluene)/mg(living cell)/day) and K-s
   (1.20mg(toluene)/1) of nonstarved cells was unable to predict the
   observed toluene breakthrough behavior when the column had been
   previously exposed to no-toluene conditions. An alternative modeling
   approach was developed based upon the assumptions that (i) degradative
   activity was completely deactivated within the no-toluene exposure
   period (53.5 h) and (ii) a lag-phase was present prior to the subsequent
   reactivation of degradative activity in previously toluene-starved
   cells. These assumptions were independently verified by batch microbial
   investigations, and the modified model provided a good fit to the same
   observed toluene breakthrough curve. Application of single lag-time and
   threshold concentration values, however, failed to predict observed
   toluene breakthrough under different toluene exposure conditions.
   Results of this experimental and modeling investigation suggested that
   substrate exposure history, including the length of the starvation
   period and the level of substrate concentration, affected the induction
   of biodegradation in the porous medium. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{An analysis of tritium and Cl-36 data collected at Yucca Mountain,
   Nevada suggests that fracture flow may occur at high velocities through
   the thick unsaturated zone. The mechanisms and extent of this ``fast
   flow{''} in fractures at Yucca Mountain are investigated with data
   analysis, mixing models and several one-dimensional modeling scenarios.
   The model results and data analysis provide evidence substantiating the
   weeps model {[}Gauthier, J.H., Wilson, M.L., Lauffer, F.C., 1992.
   Proceedings of the Third Annual International Hi-h-level Radioactive
   Waste Management Conference, vol. 1, Las Vegas, NV. American Nuclear
   Society, La Grange Park, IL, pp. 891-989] and suggest that fast flow in
   fractures with minimal fracture-matrix interaction may comprise a
   substantial proportion of the total infiltration through Yucca Mountain.
   Mixing calculations suggest that bomb-pulse tritium measurements, in
   general, represent the tail end of travel times for
   thermonuclear-test-era (bomb-pulse) infiltration. The data analysis
   shows that bomb-pulse tritium and Cl-36 measurements are correlated with
   discrete features such as horizontal fractures and areas where lateral
   flow may occur. The results presented here imply that fast flow in
   fractures may be ubiquitous at Yucca Mountain, occurring when transient
   infiltration (storms) generates flow in the connected fracture network.

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a field investigation in the
   unsaturated, fractured welded tuff within the Exploratory Studies
   Facility (ESF) at Yucca Mountain, NV. This investigation included a
   series of tests during which tracer-laced water was released into a
   high-permeability zone within `` horizontal injection borehole. The
   tracer concentration was monitored in the seepage collected in an
   excavated slot about 1.6 m below the borehole. Results showed
   significant variability in the hydrologic response of fractures and the
   matrix. Analyses of the breakthrough curves suggest that flow and
   transport pathways are dynamic, rather than fixed, and related to
   liquid-release rates. Under high release rates, fractures acted as the
   predominant flow pathways, with limited fracture-matrix interaction.
   Under low release rates, fracture flow was comparatively less dominant,
   with a noticeable contribution from matrix flow. Observations of tracer
   concentrations rebounding in seepage water, following an interruption of
   flow, provided evidence of mass exchange between the fast-flowing
   fractures and slow- or non-flowing regions. The tests also showed the
   applicability of fluorinated benzoate tracers in situations where
   multiple tracers of similar physical properties are warranted. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Solute transport in soils is affected by soil layering and soil-specific
   morphological properties. We studied solute transport in two sandy
   Spodosols: a dry Spodosol developed under oxidizing conditions of
   relatively deep groundwater and a wet Spodosol under periodically
   reducing conditions above a shallow groundwater table. The wet Spodosol
   is characterized by a diffuse and heterogeneous humus-B-horizon (i.e.,
   Spodic horizon), whereas the dry Spodosol has a sharp Spodic horizon.
   Drainage fluxes were moderately variable with a coefficient of variation
   (CV) of 25\% in the wet Spodosol and 17\% in the dry Spodosol. Solute
   transport in 1-m-long and 0.8-m-diameter soil columns was investigated
   using spatial averages of solute concentrations measured by a network of
   36 Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes. In the dry Spodosol, solute
   transport evolves from stochastic-convective to convective-dispersive at
   a depth of 0.25 in, coinciding with the depth of the Spodic horizon.
   Chloride breakthrough at the bottom of the soil columns was adequately
   well predicted by a convection-dispersion model. In the wet Spodosol,
   solute transport was heterogeneous over the entire depth of the column.
   Chloride breakthrough at 1 m depth was predicted best using a
   stochastic-convective transport model. The TDR sampling volume of 36
   probes was too small to capture the heterogeneous flow and concomitant
   transport in the wet Spodosol. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A numerical model (Queen's University Multi-Phase Flow Simulator,
   QUMPFS) was used to assess the rate of trichloroethylene (TCE) dense,
   non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) migration through fractured clay, with
   special attention focused on the influence of interbedded sand lenses.
   The presence of these sand lenses was found to increase the time
   required for the non-wetting phase to migrate through the full 30 m
   vertical extent of the clay sequence from a few days to several years.
   Applied vertical hydraulic gradients were found to be moderately
   influential in systems consisting solely of fractured clays, yet one of
   the dominant factors controlling speed of vertical migration when sand
   lenses were present. Larger displacement pressure of the sands relative
   to that of the fractures leads to slower DNAPL migration rates, due to
   the delays that occur during build-up of capillary pressures.
   Dissolution of DNAPL and subsequent matrix diffusion of the aqueous
   phase has little effect on the rate of DNAPL migration through systems
   consisting of fractured clay only, yet slows the rate of migration in
   systems containing sand lenses. In all cases examined, the rate of DNAPL
   loading to the lower aquifer far exceeded the rate of aqueous phase mass
   loading, It was also found that DNAPL reaches the lower aquifer at
   approximately the same time as the aqueous phase plumes even for systems
   experiencing downward groundwater flow due to the attenuation of the
   aqueous phase through matrix diffusion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Because of their low solubility, waste chemicals in the form of
   nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) that are entrapped in subsurface
   formations act as long-term sources of groundwater contamination. In the
   design of remediation schemes that use surfactants, it is necessary to
   estimate the mass transfer rate coefficients under multi-dimensional
   flow fields that exit at field sites. In this study, we investigate mass
   transfer under a two-dimensional flow field to obtain an understanding
   of the basic mechanisms of surfactant-enhanced dissolution and to
   quantify the mass transfer rates. Enhanced dissolution experiments in a
   two-dimensional test cell were conducted to measure rates of mass
   depletion from entrapped NAPLs to a flowing aqueous phase containing a
   surfactant. In situ measurement of transient saturation changes using a
   gamma attenuation system revealed dissolution patterns that are affected
   by the dimensionality of the groundwater flow field. Numerical modeling
   of local flow fields that changed with time, due to depletion of NAPL
   sources, enabled the examination of the basic mechanisms of NAPL
   dissolution in complex groundwater systems. Through nonlinear regression
   analysis, mass transfer rates were correlated to porous media
   properties, NAPL saturation and aqueous phase velocity. Results from the
   experiments and numerical analyses were used to identify deficiencies in
   existing methods of analysis that uses assumptions of one-dimensional
   flow. homogeneity of aquifer properties, local equilibrium and idealized
   transient mass transfer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{At the field scale, the biodegradation rate is usually estimated from
   analytical solutions to single species transport with first-order
   reactions, using measured data as input. Because many contaminants,
   e.g., chlorinated solvents, are degraded in a sequential pattern, with
   degradation products further reacting to produce new species, it is of
   great interest to quantify the transformation rate of every reaction.
   The conventional inverse solutions for identifying the transformation
   rates are limited to single species problems. In the present study, we
   propose a Successive optimization approach to identify the
   biodegradation rate for each species by using a previously developed
   analytical solution to multi-species first-order reactive transport
   using data obtained at the field scale. By specifying a link between
   analytical solutions to sequentially reactive transport problems and
   optimization methods and assuming constant transport parameters
   (velocity, dispersivities, and retardation factors), the first-order
   transformation rates are optimized successively from parent species to
   its daughter species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A model is developed for hydrocarbon biodegradation, which includes
   saturated and unsaturated flow, multi-species transport, heat transport,
   and bacterial growth processes. Numerical accuracy of the model was
   tested against analytical solutions. The model was also verified against
   laboratory results for a saturated-flow problem and reasonable match was
   obtained. Expressions are proposed for inhibition due to water content
   and temperature fluctuations. Bioactivities under cyclic water content
   variation were studied under no-flow conditions. A quantitative approach
   was used to reconcile some of the apparent contradictory conclusions
   regarding the efficiency of biodegradation of soils under wetting and
   drying conditions. The efficiency depends on the nature of the
   oxygenation process. For cases involving the presence of dissolved
   oxygen and the absence of O-2 vapor, subjecting the soil to constant
   water content close to its optimal value for degradation is most
   efficient. However, wetting and drying can enhance degradation if O-2 is
   only provided through aeration or direct contact between air and the
   medium. Also presented are the results of a typical field application of
   the model and a discussion of the effects of tides, saturation
   inhibition, and heat inhibition. Other inhibition factors, such as pH or
   salinity, can be easily incorporated in the formulation. The
   quantitative approach developed here can be used in assessing
   bioremediation not only in tidal aquifers but also in areas where
   water-table or temperature effects are of significance. The approach can
   be useful in the design of remediation strategies under water-flow or
   no-flow conditions involving water content and temperature fluctuations.

Abstract = {{Oaks (Quercus velutina Lam.) growing over a shallow aquifer contaminated
   by chlorinated hydrocarbons were studied to determine if it was possible
   to estimate the approximate year that contamination began. The annual
   rings of some trees downgradient from the contaminant release site
   contained elevated concentrations of chloride possibly derived from
   dechlorination of contaminants, Additionally, a radial-growth decline
   began in these trees at approximately the same time that chloride became
   elevated. Growth did not decline in trees that contained smaller
   concentrations of chloride. The source of elevated chloride and the
   corresponding reductions in tree growth could not be explained by
   factors other than contamination. On the basis of tree-ring evidence
   alone, the release occurred in the late 1960s or early 1970s.
   Contaminant release at a second location apparently occurred in the mid-
   to late 1970s, suggesting that the area was used for disposal for at
   least 5 years and possibly longer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN. All

Title = {{Impact of urbanization on hydrochemical evolution of groundwater and on
   unsaturated-zone gas composition in the coastal city of Tel Aviv, Israel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{The coastal city of Tel Aviv was founded at the beginning of the 20th
   century. The number of its inhabitants and its water consumption
   increased rapidly. This study analyses a 15-year record (1934-1948) of
   pre-industrial development of groundwater chemistry in the urban area.
   Archive data on concentrations of major ions, dissolved gases (CO2 and
   O-2), organic matter, and pH were available for each half-year during
   the period of 1934-1948. The major factors causing changes in the
   chemistry of groundwater flowing in three sandy sub-aquifers have been
   seawater encroachment due to overpumping, and infiltration of effluents
   from pit-latrine collectors. Influence of these factors decreases with
   depth.
   Landward-penetrating seawater passed through clayey coastal sediments,
   interbedded among sands and calcareous sandstones, and spread into the
   Kurkar Group aquifer. This has led to exchange of sodium (dominant in
   seawater) with calcium adsorbed on clay particles, enriching groundwater
   with calcium. Intensity of cation exchange decreases inland and with
   depth.
   Infiltration of pit-latrine effluents has introduced large amounts of
   ammonium into the unsaturated zone. Its rapid oxidation in unsaturated
   sediments has caused massive nitrate production, accompanied by
   pore-water acidification. This process induces dissolution of vadose
   carbonate, resulting in enrichment of groundwater recharge in calcium.
   Anthropogenically induced dissolution of calcite in the unsaturated zone
   has been the major factor for the increase of Ca2+ concentration in
   groundwater, accounting for about 80\% of this increase. In the
   interface zone, an additional 20\% of calcium has been supplied by
   cation exchange. Owing to pH increase caused by denitrification in the
   aquifer, Ca2+-rich waters supersaturated with calcite could be formed,
   especially in the capillary fringe of the uppermost sub-aquifer, which
   could induce calcite precipitation and ultimately lead to the
   cementation of sandy aquifers.
   Urban development has caused drastic changes in the gas content in the
   unsaturated zone and in groundwater. Carbon dioxide was intensively
   generated by nitrification-denitrification processes, by hydration of
   urea, to a lesser degree by oxidation of organic matter, and probably by
   anoxic biodegradation of organics. Between 1934 and 1948, concentrations
   of CO2 in unsaturated sediment air rose from 3.2\% to 7.6\%. In the
   unsaturated zone, oxygen consumption for oxidation of ammonium and
   organic matter lowered O-2 concentrations in sediment air to unusually
   low values of 3.9-12.9\%. Nitrification in the urban unsaturated Zone
   Could thus serve as a pump, sucking in atmospheric oxygen at a rate of
   about 0.3-0.5 g m(-2) day(-1). The extreme concentrations of CO2 and O-2
   in unsaturated sediments have been preserved due to production and
   consumption of gas under conditions of diminishing areas open to the
   atmosphere, uncovered by buildings and by roads. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The biodegradation of organic contaminants in the subsurface has become
   a major focus of attention, in part, due to the tremendous interest in
   applying in situ biodegradation and natural attenuation approaches for
   site remediation. The biodegradation and transport of contaminants is
   influenced by a combination of microbial and physicochemical properties
   and processes. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of
   hydrodynamic residence time, substrate concentration, and growth-related
   factors on the simulation of contaminant biodegradation and transport,
   with a specific focus on potentially condition-dependent growth
   coefficients. Two sets of data from miscible-displacement experiments,
   performed with different residence times and initial solute
   concentrations, were simulated using a transport model that includes
   biodegradation described by the Monod nonlinear equations and which
   incorporates microbial growth and oxygen limitation. Two variations of
   the model were used, one wherein metabolic lag and cell transport are
   explicitly accounted for, and one wherein they are not. The magnitude of
   the maximum specific growth rates obtained from calibration of the
   column-experiment results using the simpler model exhibits dependency on
   pore-water velocity and initial substrate concentration (C-0) for most
   cases. Specifically, the magnitude of lt., generally increases with
   increasing pore-water velocity for a specific C-0, and increases with
   decreasing C-0 for a specific pore-water velocity. Conversely, use of
   the model wherein observed tag and cell elution are explicitly accounted
   for produces growth coefficients that are similar. both to each other
   and to the batch-measured value. These results illustrate the potential
   condition-dependency of calibrated coefficients obtained from the use of
   models that do not account explicitly for all pertinent processes
   influencing transport of reactive solutes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Miscible-displacement experiments were conducted to examine the impact
   of microbial lag and bacterial cell growth on the transport of
   salicylate, a model hydrocarbon compound. The impacts of these processes
   were examined separately, as well as jointly, to determine their
   relative effects on biodegradation dynamics. For each experiment, a
   column was packed with porous medium that was first inoculated with
   bacteria that contained the NAH plasmid encoding genes for the
   degradation of naphthalene and salicylate, and then subjected to a step
   input of salicylate solution. The transport behavior of salicylate was
   non-steady for all cases examined, and was clearly influenced by a delay
   (lag) in the onset of biodegradation. This microbial lag, which was
   consistent with the results of batch experiments, is attributed to the
   induction and synthesis of the enzymes required for biodegradation of
   salicylate. The effect of microbial lag on salicylate transport was
   eliminated by exposing the column to two successive pulses of
   salicylate, thereby allowing the cells to acclimate to the carbon source
   during the first pulse. Elimination of microbial lag effects allowed the
   impact of bacterial growth on salicylate transport to be quantified,
   which was accomplished by determining a cell mass balance. Conversely,
   the impact of microbial lag was further investigated by performing a
   similar double-pulse experiment under no-growth conditions. Significant
   cell elution was observed and quantified for all conditions/systems. The
   results of these experiments allowed us to differentiate the effects
   associated with microbial lag and growth, two coupled processes whose
   impacts on the biodegradation and transport of contaminants can be
   difficult to distinguish. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, an attempt has been made to model a real field scenario,
   whereby an initially almost saturated clay liner in a waste site is
   gradually drying, due to evaporation at its lower boundary. A detailed
   conceptual model that deals with the penetration and breakthrough of
   non-aqueous-phase-liquid (NAPL) in clay liners is introduced. Water
   content of clay samples was monitored during ambient evaporation through
   apertures at the base of sample holders. Clay drying rate served as the
   primary parameter for the NAPL breakthrough study. The interconnection
   between drying rates, structural damage formation (cracks and suction)
   and NAPL penetration is especially addressed. The processes taking place
   in the clay samples during drying appear to be associated with the
   capillary effects between the different fluid phases in the vicinity of
   either the NAPL-clay or the clay-air boundaries. A conceptual model of
   NAPL penetration and breakthrough of the clay layer has been considered,
   based on both indirect and direct observations of structural damages
   produced on either clay boundaries. A mutual interaction between these
   two boundaries is suggested and discussed. NAPL breakthrough is
   suggested to take place through cracks initiated on the upper soil
   surface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional models for biological clogging and sorptive tracer
   transport were used to study the progress of clogging in a sand box
   experiment. The sand box had been inoculated with a strip of bacteria
   and exposed to a continuous injection of nitrate and acetate. Brilliant
   Blue was regularly injected during the clogging experiment and digital
   images of the tracer movement had been converted to concentration maps
   using an image analysis. The calibration of the models to the Brilliant
   Blue observations shows that Brilliant Blue has a solid biomass
   dependent sorption that is not compliant with the assumed linear
   constant K-d behaviour. It is demonstrated that the dimensionality of
   sand box experiments in comparison to column experiments results in a
   much lower reduction in hydraulic conductivity (factor of 100) and that
   the bulk hydraulic conductivity of the sand box decreased only slightly.
   However, in the central parts of the clogged area, the observations and
   simulations clearly show a complex picture of flow diverting the
   injected nutrients around the clogged area as fingers. The calibration
   of the model demonstrates that the physical and microbiological
   processes (advection, dispersion, attachment-detachment, growth-decay)
   are all needed to capture the progress of clogging. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The injection of bacteria in the subsurface has been identified as a
   potential method for in situ cleanup of contaminated aquifers. For high
   bacterial loadings, the presence of previously deposited bacteria can
   result in decreased deposition rates-a phenomenon known as blocking.
   Miscible displacement experiments were performed on short sand columns (
   similar to 5 cm) to determine how bacterial deposition on positively
   charged metal-oxyhydroxide-coated sands is affected by the presence of
   previously deposited bacteria. Approximately 8 pore volumes of a
   radiolabeled bacterial suspension at a concentration of similar to 1 X
   10(9) cells ml(-1) were introduced into the columns followed by a
   2-pore-volume flush of cell-free buffer. It was found that the presence
   of Al- and Fe-coated sand increased both deposition rates and maximum
   fractional surface coverage of bacteria on the sediment surfaces. The
   effect of grain size on maximum bacterial retention capacity, however,
   was not significant. Decreasing ionic strength from 10(-1) to 10(-2) M
   KCl resulted in noticeable decreases in sticking efficiency (a) and
   maximum surface coverage (Om) for clean silica sand-results consistent
   with DLVO theory. In columns containing positively charged Al- and
   Fe-coated sands, however, changes in alpha and theta (max) due to
   decreasing ionic strength were minimal. These findings demonstrate the
   importance of geochemical controls on the maximum bacterial retention
   capacity of sands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Several previously reported laboratory studies related to transport of
   solutes through packed columns were utilized to develop predictive
   relationships for mass-transfer rate coefficient. The data were
   classified into two groups: those obtained under rate-limited mass
   transfer between mobile and immobile water regions (physical
   nonequilibrium conditions), and those derived from rate-limited mass
   transfer between instantaneous and slow sorption sites (sorption
   nonequilibrium conditions). The mass-transfer coefficient in all these
   studies was obtained by fitting breakthrough data to a transport model
   employing a first-order rate limitations with a ``constant{''}
   mass-transfer coefficient, independent of flow conditions. This study
   demonstrated that the mass-transfer coefficient in these models is
   dependent on system parameters including pore-water velocity,
   length-scale, retardation coefficient, and particle or aggregate size.
   Predictive relationships were developed, through regression analysis,
   relating mass-transfer coefficient to residence time. The developed
   relationships adequately estimated previously reported field
   mass-transfer values. Successful simulations of field desorption data
   reported by Bahr {[}J. Contam. Hydrol. 4 (1989) 205] further demonstrate
   the potential applicability of the developed relationships. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A soil core, obtained from a contaminated field site, contaminated with
   a mixture of volatile and semivolatile organic compounds (VOC and SVOC)
   was subjected to air and steam flushing. Removal rates of volatile and
   semivolatile organic compounds were monitored during flushing. Air
   flushing removed a significant portion of the VOC present in the soil,
   but a significant decline in removal rate occurred due to decreasing VOC
   concentrations in the soil gas phase. Application of steam flushing
   after air flushing produced a significant increase in contaminant
   removal rate for the first 4 to 5 pore volumes of steam condensate.
   Subsequently, contaminant concentrations decreased slowly with
   additional pore volumes of steam flushing. The passage of a steam volume
   corresponding to 11 pore volumes of steam condensate reduced the total
   VOC concentration in the soil gas (at 20 degreesC) by a factor of 20 to
   0.07 mg/l. The corresponding total SVOC concentration in the condensate
   declined from 11 to 3 mg/l. Declines in contaminant removal rates during
   both air and steam flushing indicated rate-limited removal consistent
   with the persistence of a residual organic phase, rate-limited
   desorption, or channeling. Pressure gradients were much higher for steam
   flushing than for air flushing. The magnitude of the pressure gradients
   encountered during steam flushing for this soil indicates that, in
   addition to rate-limited contaminant removal, the soil permeability (2.1
   x 10(-9) cm(2)) would be a limiting factor in the effectiveness of steam
   flushing. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fracture mapping in a tunnel system and at nearby outcrop on the Runcorn
   Peninsula, UK, suggests the need for a review of the potential pathways
   for pollutant transport in Permo-Triassic sandstone aquifers. Sediment
   infilling is pervasive in the largest sub-vertical multi-layer fractures
   in the study area, both at the surface and to a depth of about 40 m
   below ground level. Sediment infill is inferred to have formed in situ.
   The conventional models of pollutant transport in fracture networks
   assume that they comprise open fractures, with pollutant mobility
   depending on fracture connectivity (a function of density, length,
   orientation and intersection) and aperture. The presence of extensive
   sediment fills in fractures will materially change their permeability,
   thereby reducing pollutant flux, and be of significance in the
   assessment of risks arising from chemical spillages. There has been
   little or no substantive evidence for such fills in Permo-Triassic
   sandstones in the UK, apart from observations at outcrop and anecdotes
   of sand being pumped from boreholes. Here, we report surface and rare,
   but complementary, subsurface observations of extensive fills in the
   Cheshire basin, and argue that they will only act as preferential
   pathways where they crosscut low-permeability horizons such as
   mudstones. (C)4 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A set of constitutive relationships accounting for residual NAPL in the
   unsaturated zone}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{53-77}},

Abstract = {{Although laboratory experiments show that non-aqueous phase liquid
   (NAPL) is retained in the unsaturated zone, no existing multiphase flow
   model has been developed to account for residual NAPL after NAPL
   drainage in the unsaturated zone. We developed a static constitutive set
   of saturation-capillary pressure relationships for water, NAPL and air
   that accounts for both this residual NAPL and entrapped NAPL. The set of
   constitutive relationships is formulated similarly to the set of scaled
   relationships that is frequently applied in continuum models. The new
   set consists of three fluid-phase systems: a three-phase system and a
   two-phase system, that both comply with the original constitutive model,
   and a newly introduced residual NAPL system. The new system can be added
   relatively easily to the original two- and three-phase systems.
   Entrapment is included in the model. The constitutive relationships of
   the non-drainable residual NAPL system are based on qualitative fluid
   behavior derived from a pore scale model. The pore scale model reveals
   that the amount of residual NAPL depends on the spreading coefficient
   and the water saturation. Furthermore, residual NAPL is
   history-dependent. At the continuum scale, a critical NAPL pressure head
   defines the transition from free, mobile NAPL to residual NAPL. Although
   the P-c-S relationships for water and total liquid are not independent
   in case of residual NAPL, two two-phase P-c-S relations can represent a
   three-phase residual system of P-c-S relations. A newly introduced
   parameter, referred to as the residual oil pressure head, reflects the
   mutual dependency of water and oil. Example calculations show consistent
   behavior of the constitutive model. Entrapment and retention in the
   unsaturated zone cooperate to retain NAPL. Moreover, the results of our
   constitutive model are in agreement with experimental observations. (C)

   reaction on the porous medium's aqueous-phase relative permeability,
   k(rw). Three TCE removal experiments were conducted in a 95-cm long,
   5.1-cm i.d. glass column, which was homogeneously packed with
   well-characterized 30/40-mesh silica sand. TCE was emplaced in the
   sand-pack in residual, entrapped form through a sequence of water/TCE
   imbibition and drainage steps. The column was then flushed under
   constant aqueous flux conditions for up to 104 h with either deionized
   water (reference experiment), deionized water containing 5 mM KMnO4 or
   deionized water containing 5 mM KMnO4 and 300 mM Na2HPO4. Aqueous-phase
   relative permeabilities were computed from measured flow rates and
   measurements of aqueous-phase pressure head, h obtained using pressure
   transducers connected to tensiometers distributed along the column
   length. A dual-energy gamma radiation system was used to monitor changes
   in fluid saturation that occurred during each experiment. In addition,
   column effluent samples were collected for chemical analyses.
   Dissolution of TCE during deionized water flushing led to an increase in
   k(rw) by similar to 22\% and a local reduction in h. On the other hand,
   Vigorous CO2 gas production and precipitation of MnO2 was visually
   observed during flushing with deionized water that contained 5 mM KMnO4.
   As a consequence, k(rw) declined by similar to 96\% and h increased
   locally by more than 1000 cm H2O during the first 24 h of the
   experiment, causing sand-pack ruptures and pump failure. Conversely,
   less CO2 gas production and MnO2 precipitation was visually observed
   during flushing with deionized water that contained 5 mM KMnO4 and 300
   mM Na2HPO4. Consequently, only small increases in h (< 15 cm H2O) were
   observed in this experiment due to a reduction in k(rw) of similar to
   53\%. While we must attribute changes in h due to variations in k(rw) to
   our specific experimental design (constant aqueous flux, one-dimensional
   flow experiments), these experiments nevertheless confirm that
   successful application of in situ chemical oxidation of TCE requires
   consideration of detrimental processes such as MnO2 precipitation and
   CO2 gas formation. In addition, our results indicate that utilization of
   a buffered oxidant solution may improve the effectiveness of in-situ
   oxidation of TCE by KMnO4 in otherwise weakly buffered porous media. (C)

Abstract = {{Microbial degradation rates in the subsurface are not only limited by
   the physiological capacity of the organisms, but also by inefficient
   supply of nutrients to the microbes. Although mass transfer limitation
   of biodegradation in the subsurface has been postulated for years,
   experimental evidence is still scarce. In the column experiments
   described here, diffusive transport of 4-nitroanisole from the bulk
   solution to cells of Rhodococcus opacus strain AS2 immobilized on glass
   beads or sand appeared to be responsible for the slow transformation
   rates observed. Assuming steady state, we applied a coupled
   transformation/transport equation to these data (Best equation) and
   apparent bead-related mass transfer coefficients were found to increase
   in proportion to the surface area covered with bacteria. This implies
   that mass transfer coefficients for individual cells remained constant.
   In an idealized oligotrophic environment where cells are only loosely
   clustered and do not shield each other, we would therefore expect
   biodegradation rates to be independent from the longitudinal
   distribution of the total biomass along a given flow path. Moreover,
   apparent mass transfer coefficients increased with the grain size of the
   column fillings, but did not change upon varying the flow rate. With a
   limiting external transport step, overall transformation fluxes do not
   become saturated at concentrations as low as predicted for
   Michaelis-Menten-type kinetics. Mass transfer limitation thus offers a
   justification for the common assumption that biodegradation rates in the
   subsurface follow first order kinetics in a wide concentration range.

Abstract = {{This study observes the dispersion process of chloride through three
   undisturbed soil columns (snbA, sabB and arg) of different texture under
   both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Overall, 17 leaching
   experiments were conducted by means of an equipment designed and built
   in Portici together with the DITEC of the University of Basilicata.
   During the experiments, both symmetric and positive asymmetric
   breakthrough curves of the chloride anion were measured. As expected,
   manifest asymmetry was obtained especially for soil columns labeled as
   sabA and arg. In such columns, it was also noted that the degree of
   asymmetry increased as the flow density increased at the sample surface.
   The experiments conducted on soil column labeled as sabB resulted in
   more symmetric BTCs.
   The experimental data were firstly analysed using the classical
   two-parameter CD model. The variation of the dispersion coefficient, D,
   with pore water velocity, nu (0), and porous medium characteristics was
   explored in detail. The application to all experimental data of the
   four-parameter MIM model, which compartmentalises the pore water in the
   mobile-stagnant domains provided an insignificant different description
   of BTCs, even of the asymmetric ones. Furthermore, it resulted in
   ill-defined parameters, especially those related to the partitioning in
   the mobile-immobile phases. However, for all the three soils examined
   the two parameter CD model proved to be very powerful even in
   interpreting asymmetric BTCs. In any case, it should be emphasised that
   the agreement of outflow experimental data with a mechanistic model does
   not unequivocally identify mechanism of solute transport in the soil. In
   fact, when we applied the CLT model, which is based on a stochastic
   approach, the BTCs were comparably well predicted. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The distributions of hydrocarbon contaminants and hydrogeochemical
   parameters were investigated in a shallow sand aquifer highly
   contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons leaked from solvent storage
   tanks. For these purposes, a variety of field investigations and studies
   were performed, which included installation of over 100 groundwater
   monitoring wells and piezometers at various depths, soil logging and
   analyses during well and piezometer installation, chemical analysis of
   groundwater, pump tests, and slug tests. Continuous water level
   monitoring at three selected wells using automatic data-logger and
   manual measuring at other wells were also conducted. Based on analyses
   of the various investigations and tests, a number of factors were
   identified to explain the distribution of the hydrocarbon contaminants
   and hydrogeochemical parameters. These factors include indigenous
   biodegradation, hydrostratigraphy, preliminary pump-and-treat remedy,
   recharge by rainfall, and subsequent water level fluctuation. The
   permeable sandy layer, in which the mean water table elevation is
   maintained, provided a dominant pathway for contaminant transport. The
   preliminary pump-and-treat action accelerated the movement of the
   hydrocarbon contaminants and affected the redox evolution pattern.
   Seasonal recharge by rain, together with indigenous biodegradation,
   played an important role in the natural attenuation of the petroleum
   hydrocarbons via mixing/dilution and biodegradation. The water level
   fluctuations redistributed the hydrocarbon contaminants by partitioning
   them into the soil groundwater. The identified factors are not
   independent but closely inter-correlated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional model for colloid transport in geochemically and
   physically heterogeneous porous media is presented. The model considers
   patchwise geochemical heterogeneity, which is suitable to describe the
   chemical variability of many surficial aquifers with ferric
   oxyhydroxide-coated porous matrix, as well as spatial variability of
   hydraulic conductivity, which results in heterogeneous flow field. The
   model is comprised of a transient fluid flow equation, a transient
   colloid transport equation, and an equation for the dynamics of colloid
   deposition and release. Numerical simulations were carried out with the
   model to investigate the colloid transport behavior in layered and
   randomly heterogeneous porous media. Results demonstrate that physical
   and geochemical heterogeneities markedly affect the colloid transport
   behavior. Layered physical or geochemical heterogeneity can result in
   distinct preferential flow paths of colloidal particles. Furthermore,
   the combined effect of layered physical and geochemical heterogeneity
   may result in enhanced or reduced preferential flow of colloids. Random
   distribution of physical heterogeneity (hydraulic conductivity) results
   in a random flow field and an irregularly distributed colloid
   concentration profile in the porous medium. Contrary to random physical
   heterogeneity, the effect of random patchwise geochemical heterogeneity
   on colloid transport behavior is not significant. It is mostly the mean
   value of geochemical heterogeneity rather than its distribution that
   governs the colloid transport behavior. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Contaminant transport in coastal aquifers is complicated partly due to
   the conditions at the seaward boundary including seawater intrusion and
   tidal variations of sea level. Their inclusion in modelling this system
   will be computationally expensive. Therefore, it will be instructive to
   investigate the consequence of simplifying the seaward boundary
   condition by neglecting the seawater density and tidal variations in
   numerical predictions of contaminant transport in this zone. This paper
   presents a comparison of numerical predictions for a simplified seaward
   boundary condition with experimental results for a corresponding
   realistic one including a saltwater interface and tidal variations.
   Different densities for contaminants are considered. The comparison
   suggests that the neglect of the seawater intrusion and tidal variations
   does not affect noticeably the overall migration rate of the plume
   before it reaches the saltwater interface. However, numerical prediction
   shows that a more dense contaminant travels further seaward and part of
   the solute mass exits under the sea if the seawater density is not
   included. This is not consistent with the experimental result, which
   shows that the contaminant travels upwards to the shoreline along the
   saltwater interface. Neglect of seawater density, therefore, will result
   in an underestimation of the exit rate of solute mass around the
   coastline and fictitious migration paths under the seabed. For a less
   dense contaminant, neglect of seawater density has little effect on
   numerical prediction of migration paths. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

   and multiple porosity media are considered. At least in Laplace domain,
   all solutions can be written in closed analytical formulae. Partly, the
   solutions can also be inverted analytically. If not, analytical
   calculation of the steady-state concentration distributions, evaluation
   of temporal moments and numerical inversion are still possible. Formulae
   for several simple boundary conditions are given and visualized in this
   paper. The derived novel solutions are widely applicable and are very
   useful for the validation of numerical transport codes. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The use of organic amendments has been suggested as a method of
   controlling pesticide leaching through soils. The enarenados soils of
   the intensive horticulture of the Almeria province of southern Spain
   contain buried organic matter horizons above a soil layer amended with
   clay. This region is ideal for understanding the potential for and
   limitations of organic amendments in preventing pesticide pollution.
   This study measured the sorption and degradation potential of carbofuran
   in this soil system and the hydrological behaviour of the soil horizons.
   The sorption of carbofuran was controlled by the organic carbon content,
   the degradation was strongly pH-dependent and the acidic organic layer
   protected the sorbed carbofuran against degradation. Hydrologically, the
   soil system is dominated by pending above an amended clay layer and by
   the presence of macropores that can transport water through this clay. A
   simple model is proposed on this basis and shows that although high
   levels of dissolved organic carbon can be released by buried organic
   horizons, the major control on re-release of sorbed pesticide is the
   potential for sorption hysteresis in this organic layer. A comparison of
   sorption and degradation data for carbamate insecticides used in the
   region with groundwater observations for these compounds shows that no
   amount of incorporated organic would protect against pollution from
   highly water-soluble compounds. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The presence of an immobile gaseous phase in an otherwise-saturated
   porous medium affects the transport of volatile compounds. The linear
   theory of partitioning tracers suggests that a volatile tracer
   introduced into such a system should be retarded with a constant
   retardation factor. Using high concentrations, however, the saturation
   of the gaseous phase will change as an effect of the tracer test itself.
   Competitive gas transfer among all volatile compounds and the change of
   saturation may lead to tracer concentrations that are temporarily higher
   than those injected. We analyze the system in the framework of the
   coherence theory by Helfferich {[}Soc. pet. Eng. J. 21 (1) (1981) 51].
   The governing equations are formulated as functions of total
   concentration, i.e., the mass of solutes in all phases per pore volume.
   Neglecting dispersion and mass-transfer kinetics, we derive the
   characteristic form of the resulting system of hyperbolic equations. In
   a system with N volatile compounds, a variation of the concentrations
   splits up into N waves, each traveling with its own characteristic
   velocity. If the presence of a gaseous phase is sustained, one wave will
   be a standing one. We perform numerical model calculations for tracers
   with various Henry's law coefficients and show that the results agree
   with the: semi-analytical solution obtained by coherence theory. (C)

Abstract = {{In preparation for a field experiment where a NAPL will be injected into
   a fractured sandstone aquifer, a 2D invasion percolation model of DNAPL
   migration in a single horizontal fracture with varying aperture has been
   developed. This simulation investigated the effect of spatially
   correlated fracture aperture fields on pressure-saturation
   relation!;hips as a function of variable aperture mean, standard
   deviation, and spatial correlation statistics under hydrostatic
   conditions. Results from spatially correlated variable aperture fields
   can be significantly different from random fields. Longer ranges
   decreased entry pressures and higher standard deviations decreased
   nonwetting phase saturations. Mean aperture is the major control on
   displacement pressure, entry pressure and the form of the:
   pressure-saturation curve. Simulation results using statistical
   parameters for a variable aperture natural sandstone fracture us
   described by Yeo et al. {[}International Journal of Rock Mechanics: and
   Mining Sciences 35 (1998) 1051] closely resemble a Brooks-Corey
   pressure-saturation function: and exhibit a distinct entry pressure
   followed by a rapid increase in nonwetting phase saturation. Graphical
   estimates of entry pressure provide a good approximation of the critical
   aperture controlling the formation of a continuous nonwetting phase
   pathway in a variable aperture fracture. Consequently, we show that
   multiphase now concepts developed for porous media can successfully he
   applied to variable aperture fractures. Entry pressure correlates well
   to the mean aperture in these simulations when using a Gaussian
   distribution of fracture aperture. Interpreted aperture distributions
   from NAPL injection experiments do not fit the true distribution well at
   low nonwetting phase saturations, but do at higher saturations above the
   entry pressure. Consequently, true, mechanical aperture variation within
   a fracture plane cannot be determined from NAPL injection experiments
   either in the field or laboratory. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{We examine how the processes of advection, dispersion,
   oxidation-reduction, and adsorption combine to affect the transport of
   chromium through columns packed with pyrolusite (beta -MnO2)-coated
   sand. We find that beta -MnO2 effectively oxidizes Cr(III) to Cr(VI) and
   that the extent of oxidation is sensitive to changes in pH, pore water
   velocity, and influent concentrations of Cr(III). Cr(III) oxidation
   rates, although initially high, decline well before the supply of beta
   -MnO2 is depleted, suggesting that a reaction product inhibits the
   conversion of Cr(III) to Cr(VI). Rate-limited reactions govern the weak
   adsorption of each chromium species, with Cr(III) adsorption varying
   directly with pH and Cr(VI) adsorption varying inversely with pH. The
   breakthrough data on chromium transport can be matched closely by
   calculations of a simple model that accounts for (1)
   advective-dispersive transport of Cr(III), Cr(VI), and dissolved oxygen,
   (2) first-order kinetics adsorption of the reduced and oxidized chromium
   species. and (3) nonlinear rate-limited oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI).
   Our work supplements the limited database on the transport of
   redox-sensitive metals in porous media and provides a means for
   quantifying the coupled processes that contribute to this transport. (C)

Abstract = {{Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are immiscible with water and
   can give rise to highly fingered fluid distributions when infiltrating
   through water-saturated porous media. In this paper, a conceptual
   mobile-immobile-zone (MIZ) model is presented to describe the structure
   of a DNAPL finger in water-saturated porous media and the velocity of
   finger propagation. A finger is composed of a finger body and a tip. The
   finger body has a mobile core and an immobile sheath. All the DNAPL
   within the tip of a finger is mobile. Lab experiments utilizing image
   analyses of a DNAPL (PCE) penetrating into water-saturated homogeneous
   glass beads were carried out in a two-dimensional transparent chamber.
   The results show that the fingers elongated almost linearly with time.
   The Fingers did not grow laterally after the tip of the finger had
   passed, The average finger diameters were between 3.9 and 5.4 min for
   PCE propagation in water-saturated glass bead porous media with mean
   particle diameters from 0.32 to 1.36 mm. The estimated mobile core
   diameters were 51-60\% of the average finger diameters. (C) 2001

Title = {{Transport and retention of clay particles in saturated porous media.
   Influence of ionic strength and pore velocity}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to experimentally evaluate the role of ionic
   strength and pore velocity on clay suspension transport and retention
   through a saturated porous medium. A smectite suspension was injected
   into columns filled with a very fine quartz sand. Experiments were
   carried out at constant pore velocity with increasing ionic strength
   adjusted with a divalent electrolyte (CaCl2) and at constant ionic
   strength (using three chemical conditions) with decreasing pore
   velocity. Typical colloid breakthrough curves show two important
   behaviors: a constant outlet concentration value after a transient
   phase, and a pronounced tailing effect at the end of the injection step.
   No differences were observed between the mean travel time of a solute
   tracer and that of the clay suspension, The classical
   advection-dispersion equation coupled with a first-order two-site
   kinetics model was used to reproduce the experimental breakthrough
   curves. The kinetic model consisted in a site with irreversible
   deposition and a reversible site used to reproduce the transient phase
   preceding the plateau of the experimental breakthrough curves, The
   particle fraction kept by the porous medium increases with ionic
   strength; consequently the kinetic parameters of the numerical model
   vary with chemistry. The irreversible sorption rate (K-irr: equivalent
   to a clean-bed filter coefficient) increases with ionic strength and was
   directly determined from experimental data, With increasing ionic
   strength, the deposition rate (K-d) for the reversible sorption
   increases whereas the release rate (K-r) decreases. The kinetic
   parameters of the reversible site show an evolution with pore velocity
   similar to that observed in kinetics model used for modeling solute
   transport in double porosity media. With decreasing pore velocities, the
   retention of clay particles increases but the kinetic deposition
   coefficient of the irreversible site decreases. Particle deposition can
   also be described and reinterpreted in terms of collector efficiency
   using the concept of the sphere-in-cell model. The collector efficiency,
   which adds a correction to the kinetic parameter with the residence
   time, is a more consistent way to represent particle retention. Its
   value increases with increasing ionic strength and decreasing pore
   velocity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{De-icing chemicals used during the winter season are potential
   pollutants for the groundwater underneath the new main airport of
   Norway. Several field experiments examining the transport and
   degradation of propyleneglycol (PG), potassium acetate (KAc) and
   non-reactive tracers were performed in a lysimeter trench under natural
   snowmelting conditions. Chemicals were applied underneath the snow cover
   and the transport in a heterogeneous coarse sandy soil was examined by
   extracting soil water from 30 or 40 suction cups placed at five depths
   between 0.4 and 2.4 m depth. Transport and degradation was analysed by
   spatial moment calculations. The de-icing chemicals showed the same
   basic displacement as chemically inactive tracers, an initial fast
   transport during the melting period followed by a period of stagnation
   throughout the summer season. PG seemed to be displaced to greater
   depths compared to non-reactive tracer after the first application.
   However, computer simulations of transport and degradation in a
   heterogeneous unsaturated soil showed that decreasing degradation
   constants with depth can generate a downward movement of the centre of
   mass without any flow occurring in the system. Potassium acetate showed
   some adsorption, with calculated retardation factors of approximately
   1.3 and 1.2. The degradation rate constant for PG was calculated to be
   0.015 day(-1) in 1994 and increased to 0.047 day(-1) in the second
   application made in 1995. The degradation rate constant for acetate was
   estimated to be 0.02 day(-1). Increased manganese concentrations seem to
   be a good indicator of degradation of PG and Ac. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective of the following research is to theoretically quantify the
   enhancement of interphase mass transfer of dissolved non-aqueous phase
   liquid (NAPL) compounds from the non-aqueous phase to the aqueous phase
   and the enhancement of dispersive mass transport from a NAPL zone due to
   destruction of dissolved NAPL compounds, For relatively slow reaction
   rates, such as for permanganate and perchloroethene (PCE), local-scale
   mass transfer enhancement is expected to be small. Dispersive mass
   transport with reaction from a horizontal NAPL zone can be quantified
   using equations derived for a mathematically equivalent falling film
   reactor system. In contrast to local-scale interphase mass transfer,
   dispersive mass transport from NAPL zones may be significantly increased
   by reaction. Enhancement factors due to destruction of the NAPL
   compound(s) are mainly dependent on NAPL solubility and oxidant
   concentration and to a lesser extent on reaction rate, stoichiometry,
   and transverse dispersion coefficients. Higher NAPL solubility and/or
   lower oxidant concentration reduces the maximum expected enhancement
   factor. Reaction enhancement factors for mass transport from NAPL zones
   are expected to be in the range of 5-50 for permanganate and chlorinated
   solvents. Theoretical results suggest that assuming instantaneous
   reaction rates may be appropriate for dispersive mass transport from
   NAPL zones. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Volatilization of selenium (Se) from soil to the atmosphere involves
   several sequential chemical reactions that form volatile Se species,
   followed by transport of the gaseous Se through the soil. This paper
   describes a numerical model that simulates the chemical and physical
   processes governing the production and transport of Se vapor in
   unsaturated soil. The model couples the four Se species involved in the
   production of Se vapor through chemical reactions, and allows each to
   migrate through the soil by advection, liquid or vapor diffusion
   depending on its affinity for the dissolved or vapor phase. The coupled
   transformations and transport of the four Se species, i.e., selenate,
   selenite, elemental and organic Se, and Se vapor, were calculated based
   on the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method. The model was used to
   analyze fluxes of Se vapor measured from a soil amended with inorganic
   Se in the form of selenate and covered with unamended clean soil of
   various thicknesses. Evolution of Se vapor from the soil was very fast,
   with measurable amounts of Se detected within 24 h. The peak of Se
   volatilization, detected at the 6th day, reached 3.31 Se mug/day for the
   uncovered soil, but was reduced to near the detection limit (0.05
   mug/day) in the presence of a 8- or 16-cm clean soil cover. With two
   reaction rate coefficients fitted to the data, the model described Se
   volatilization very well. The estimated rate coefficient of Se
   methylation was unexpectedly high, with a value of 0.167/day. The net
   volatilization of Se, however, was severely inhibited by the fast
   demethylation, i.e., the reverse reaction which converted volatile Se
   species back into nonvolatile forms. As a result, Se vapor only
   penetrated a few centimeters in the soil. The demethylation rate
   coefficient, assessed by independent transport experiments using
   dimethyl selenide, was estimated as 186.8/day, corresponding to a
   half-life of only 5.3 min for Se vapor. Results of this study indicated
   that rapid demethylation of Se vapor during its diffusive transport
   through a soil is probably an important limiting factor in the
   volatilization of Se under natural conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Computational simulations of two-phase flow in porous media are used to
   investigate the feasibility of replacing a porous medium containing
   heterogeneities with an equivalent homogeneous medium. Simulations are
   performed for the case of infiltration of a dense nonaqueous phase
   liquid (DNAPL) in a water-saturated. heterogeneous porous medium. For
   two specific porous media, with periodic and rather simple heterogeneity
   patterns, the existence of a representative elementary volume (REV) is
   studied. Upscaled intrinsic permeabilities and upscaled nonlinear
   constitutive relationships for two-phase flow systems are numerically
   calculated and the effects of heterogeneities are evaluated. Upscaled
   capillary pressure-saturation curves for drainage are found to be
   distinctly different from the lower-scale curves for individual regions
   of heterogeneity. irreducible water saturation for the homogenized
   medium is found to be much larger than the corresponding lower-scale
   values. Numerical simulations for both heterogeneous and homogeneous
   representations of the considered porous media are carried out. Although
   the homogenized model simulates the spreading behavior of DNAPL
   reasonably well, it still fails to match completely the results form the
   heterogeneous simulations. This seems to be due, in part, to the
   nonlinearities inherent to multiphase flow systems. Although we have
   focussed on a periodic heterogeneous medium in this study, our
   methodology is applicable to other forms of heterogeneous media. In
   particular, the procedure for identification of a REV, and associated
   upscaled constitutive relations, can be used for randomly heterogeneous
   or layered media as well. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A unique field experiment has been undertaken at the CFB Borden research
   site to investigate the development of dissolved chlorinated solvent
   plumes from a residual dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) source.
   The ``emplaced-source{''} tracer test methodology involved a controlled
   emplacement of a block-shaped source of sand containing chlorinated
   solvents below the water table. The gradual dissolution of this residual
   DNAPL solvent source under natural aquifer conditions caused dissolved
   solvent plumes of trichloromethane (TCM), trichloroethene (TCE) and
   perchloroethene (PCE) to continuously develop down gradient. Source
   dissolution and 3-D plume development were successfully monitored via
   173 multilevel samplers over a 475-day tracer test period prior to site
   remediation research being initiated. Detailed groundwater level and
   hydraulic conductivity data were collected. Development of plumes with
   concentrations spanning 1-700,000 mug/l is described and key processes
   controlling their migration identified. Plumes were observed to be
   narrow due to the weakness of transverse dispersion processes and long
   due to advection and significant longitudinal dispersion, very limited
   sorptive retardation and negligible, if any, attenuation due to
   biodegradation or abiotic reaction. TCM was shown to be essentially
   conservative, TCE very nearly conservative and PCE, consistent with its
   greater hydrophobicity, more retarded yet having a greater mobility than
   observed in previous Borden field tests. The absence of biodegradation
   was ascribed to the prevailing aerobic conditions and lack of any
   additional biodegradable carbon substrates. The transient groundwater
   flow regime caused significant transverse lateral plume movement, plume
   asymmetry and was likely responsible for most of the, albeit limited,
   transverse horizontal plume spreading. In agreement with the widespread
   incidence of extensive TCE and PCE plumes throughout the industrialized
   world, the experiment indicates such solvent plumes are likely to be
   highly mobile and persistent, at least in aquifers that are aerobic and
   have low sorption potential (low f(oc) content). (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Field biogeochemical characterization and laboratory microcosm studies
   were performed to assess the potential for future biotransformation of
   trichloroethylene (TCE) and toluene in a plume containing petroleum
   hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents at the former Wurtsmith Air Force
   Base in Oscoda, MI. In situ terminal electron accepting processes
   (TEAPs), contaminant composition and microbial phylogeny were studied at
   a plume transect 100 m downgradient of the source. The presence of
   reduced electron accepters, relevant microbial communities, and elevated
   dissolved methane and carbon dioxide concentrations at the transect, as
   well as downgradient accumulation of BTEX metabolites and dechlorination
   products, indicated that past or current reductive dechlorination at the
   transect was likely driven by BTEX biodegradation in the methanogenic
   zone. However, TCE and toluene mineralization in sediment-groundwater
   microcosms without added electron accepters did not exceed 5\% during
   300 days of incubation and was nearly invariant with original sediment
   TEAP, even following amendments of nitrogen and phosphorus.
   Mineralization rates were on the order of 0.0015-0.03 mu mol/g day.
   After 8 months, microcosms showed evidence of methanogenesis, but CH4
   and CO2 production arose from the degradation of contaminants other than
   toluene. Cis-dichloroethylene was observed in only one methanogenic
   microcosm after more than 500 days. It appears likely that spatially and
   temporally dynamic redox zonation at the plume transect will prevent
   future sustained reductive dehalogenation of highly chlorinated
   solvents, for during the course of a year, the predominant TEAP at the
   highly contaminated water table shifted from methanogenesis to iron- and
   sulfate-reduction. It is recommended that biotransformation studies
   combine considerations of long-term, spatially relevant changes in redox
   zonation with laboratory-scale studies of electron donor utilization and
   cometabolic substrate transformation to yield a more accurate assessment
   of natural bioattenuation of specific pollutants in aquifers
   contaminated by undefined organic waste mixtures. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Displacement studies on leaching of bromide and two pesticides (atrazine
   and isoproturon) were conducted under unsaturated steady state flow
   conditions in 24 small undisturbed soil columns (5.7 cm in diameter and
   10 cm long) each collected from two sites differing in soil structure
   and organic carbon content in North Germany. There were large and
   irregular variabilities in the characteristics of both soils, as well as
   in the shapes of breakthrough curves (BTCs) of different columns,
   including some with early breakthrough and increased tailing.
   qualitatively indicating the presence of preferential flow. It was
   estimated that one preferential flow column (PFC) at site A. and four at
   site B, contributed, respectively to 11\% and 58\% of the accumulated
   leached fraction and to more than 80\% of the maximum observed standard
   deviation (SD) in the field-scale concentration and mass flux of
   pesticides at two sites. The bromide BTCs of two sites were analyzed
   with the equilibrium convection-dispersion equation (CDE) and a
   non-equilibrium two-region/mobile-immobile model. Transport parameters
   of these models for individual BTCs were determined using a curve
   fitting program, CXTFIT, and by the time moment method. For the CDE
   based equilibrium model, the mean values of retardation factor, R,
   considered separately for all columns. PFCs or non-preferential flow
   columns (NPFCs) were comparable for the two methods: significant
   differences were observed in the values of dispersion coefficients of
   two sites using the two estimation methods. It was inferred from the
   estimated parameters of non-equilibrium model that 5-12\% of water at
   site A, and 12\% at site B, was immobile during displacement in NPFCs.
   The corresponding values for PFCs of two sites were much larger, ranging
   from 25\% to 51\% by CXTFIT and from 24\% to 72\% by the moment method,
   suggesting the role of certain mechanisms other than immobile water in
   higher degrees of non-equilibrium in these columns. Peclet numbers in
   PFCs of both sites were consistently smaller than five, indicating the
   inadequacy of the non-equilibrium model to incorporate the effect of all
   forms of non-equilibrium in PFCs. Overall, the BTCs of individual NPFCs,
   PFCs and of field average concentration at the two sites were better
   reproduced with parameters obtained from CXTFIT than by the moment
   method. The moment method failed to capture the peak concentrations in
   PFCs, but tended to describe the desorption and tail branches of BTCs
   better than the curve fitting approach. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Two families of approaches exist to simulate reactive transport in
   groundwater: The Direct Substitution Approach (DSA). based on
   Newton-Raphson and the Picard or Sequential Iteration Approach (SIA). We
   applied basic versions of both methods to several test casts and
   compared both computational demands and quality of the solution fur
   varying grid size. Results showed that the behavior of the two
   approaches is sensitive to both grid size and chemistry. As a general
   rule, the DSA is more robust than the SIA. in the sense that its
   convergence is less sensitive to time step size (any approach will
   converge given a sufficiently small time step). Moreover. the DSA leads
   to a better simulation of sharp fronts, which can only he reproduced
   with fine grids after many iterations when the SIA is used. As a
   consequence, the DSA runs faster than SIA in chemically difficult cases
   (i.e.. highly non-linear and/or very retarded), because the SIA may
   require very small time steps to converge. On the other hand, the size
   of the system of equations is. much larger for the DSA than for the SIA.
   so that its CPU time and memory requirements tend to be less favorable
   with increasing grid size. As a result, the SIA may become faster than
   the DSA for very large. chemically simple problems. The use of an
   iterative linear solver for the DSA makes its CPU time less sensitive to
   grid size. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A simple algebraic model is proposed to estimate the transport of a
   volatile or soluble chemical caused by oscillatory flow of fluid in a
   porous medium. The model is applied to the barometric pumping of vapors
   in the vadose zone, and to the transport of dissolved species by earth
   tides in an aquifer. In the model, the fluid moves sinusoidally with
   time in the porosity of the soil. The chemical concentration in the
   mobile fluid is considered to equilibrate with the concentration in the
   surrounding matrix according to a characteristic time governed by
   diffusion. sorption, or other rate processes. The model provides a
   closed form solution, to which barometric pressure data are applied in
   an example of pore gas motion in the vadose zone. The model predicts
   that the additional diffusivity due barometric pumping in an unfractured
   vadose zone would be comparable to the diffusivity in stagnant pore gas
   if the equilibration time is 1 day or longer. Water motion due to the M2
   lunar tide is examined as an example of oscillatory transport in an
   aquifer. It is shown that the tidal motion of the water in an aquifer
   might significantly increase the vertical diffusivity of dissolved
   species when compared to diffusion in an absolutely stagnant aquifer.
   but the hydrodynamic dispersivity due to tidal motion or gravitational
   flow would probably exceed the diffusivity due to oscillatory advection.

Abstract = {{Previous studies have revealed the presence of pore-scale variability in
   diffusivity in the Culebra (dolomite) member of the Rustler Formation,
   NM. In this study, right laboratory-scale diffusion experiments on five
   Culebra samples were analyzed using a methodology for modeling solute
   diffusion through porous media in the presence of multiple matrix
   diffusivities. D(p). A lognormal distribution of D(p) is assumed within
   each of the lab samples. The estimated standard deviation (sigma (d)) of
   ln(D(p)) within each sample ranges from 0 to 1, with most values lying
   between 0.5 and 1. The variability over all samples leads to a combined
   sigma (d) in the range of 1.0-1.2. which is consistent with the
   distribution of independently determined formation factor measurements
   for similar Culebra samples. A comparison of our estimation results to
   other rock properties suggests that. at the lab-scale. the geometric
   mean of D(p) increases with bulk porosity and the quantity of
   macroscopic features such as vugs and fractures. However, sigma (d)
   appears to be determined by variability within such macroscopic features
   and/or by micropore-scale heterogeneity. In addition, comparison of
   these experiments to those at larger spatial scales suggests that
   increasing sample volume results in an increase in sigma (d). (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Selecting the proper primary variables is a critical step in efficiently
   modeling the highly nonlinear problem of multiphase subsurface flow in a
   heterogeneous porous-fractured media, Current simulation and ground
   modeling techniques consist of (1) spatial discretization of mass and/or
   heat conservation equations using finite difference or finite element
   methods. (2) fully implicit time discretization: (3) solving the
   nonlinear, discrete algebraic equations using a Newton iterative scheme.
   Previous modeling efforts indicate that the choice of primary variables
   for a Newton iteration not only impacts computational performance of a
   numerical code, but may also determine the feasibility of a numerical
   modeling study in many field applications. This paper presents an
   analysis and general recommendations for selecting primary variables in
   simulating multiphase, subsurface flow for one-active phase (Richards'
   equation), two-phase (gas and liquid) and three-phase (gas, water and
   nonaqueous phase liquid or NAPL) conditions. In many cases. a dynamic
   variable switching or variable substitution scheme may have to be used
   in order to achieve optimal numerical performance and robustness, The
   selection of primary variables depends in general on the sensitivity of
   the system of equations to the variables selected at given phase and
   flow conditions. We will present a series of numerical tests and
   large-scale field simulation examples, including modeling one
   (active)-phase. two-phase and three-phase flow problems in
   multi-dimensional, porous-fractured subsurface systems, (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A field experiment was designed to determine the combined effect of
   leaching and natural attenuation on the redistribution dynamics of
   kerosene-a volatile petroleum hydrocarbon mixture (VPHM)-and of its
   selected individual components in the soil subsurface. Variables
   included the composition of contaminant spilled, the soil water content
   before contamination and the leaching pattern. Temporal changes in the
   residual kerosene concentration and composition in the soil subsurface
   of the experimental field during 39 days and leaching by 500 mm of
   irrigation water were determined to a depth of 100 cm.
   The main processes controlling contaminant attenuation were
   volatilization and redistribution with depth. Soil hydration status was
   found to affect the attenuation, redistribution and composition of VPHM
   in the porous media. An initial relative increase of n-alkanes in the
   subsurface compared with the total VPHM in the first leaching period was
   a result of the volatilization of low vapor pressure compounds. The
   redistribution of individual components in the soil profile during
   leaching was in accordance with their physico-chemical properties. (C)

Abstract = {{A matrix of batch, column and two-dimensional (2-D) box experiments was
   conducted to investigate the coupled effects of rate-limited
   solubilization and layering on the entrapment and subsequent recovery of
   a representative dense NAPL, tetrachloroethylene (PCE). during
   surfactant flushing. Batch experiments were performed to determine the
   equilibrium solubilization capacity of the surfactant. polyoxyethylene
   (20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), and to measure fluid viscosity,
   density and interfacial tension. Results of one-dimensional column
   studies indicated that micellar solubilization of residual PCE was
   rate-limited at Darcy velocities ranging from 0.8 to 8.2 cm/h and during
   periods of flow interruption. Effluent concentration data were used to
   develop effective mass transfer coefficient (K-c) expressions that were
   dependent upon the Darcy velocity and duration of flow interruption. To
   simulate subsurface heterogeneity, 2-D boxes were packed with layers of
   F-70 Ottawa sand and Wurtsmith aquifer material within 20-30 mesh Ottawa
   sand. A 4\% Tween 80 solution was then flushed through PCE-contaminated
   boxes at several flow velocities, with periods of flow interruption.
   Effluent concentration data and visual observations indicated that both
   rate-limited solubilization and pooling of PCE above the fine layers
   reduced PCE recovery to levels below those anticipated from batch and
   column measurements. These experimental results demonstrate the
   potential impact of both mass transfer limitations and subsurface
   layering on the recovery of PCE during surfactant enhanced aquifer
   remediation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model of surfactant enhanced solubilization was developed
   and applied to the simulation of nonaqueous phase liquid recovery in
   two-dimensional heterogeneous laboratory sand tank systems. Model
   parameters were derived from independent, small-scale, batch and column
   experiments. These parameters included viscosity, density,
   solubilization capacity. surfactant sorption. interfacial tension.
   permeability. capillary retention functions, and interphase mass
   transfer correlations. Model predictive capability was assessed for the
   evaluation of the micellar solubilization of tetrachloroethylene (PCE)
   in the two-dimensional systems. Predicted effluent concentrations and
   mass recovery agreed reasonably well with measured values. Accurate
   prediction of enhanced solubilization behavior in the sand tanks was
   found to require the incorporation of pore-scale. system-dependent,
   interphase mass transfer limitations, including an explicit
   representation of specific interfacial contact area. Predicted effluent
   concentrations and mass recovery were also found to depend strongly upon
   the initial NAPL entrapment configuration. Numerical results
   collectively indicate that enhanced solubilization processes in
   heterogeneous. laboratory sand tank systems can be successfully
   simulated using independently measured soil parameters and
   column-measured mass transfer coefficients, provided that permeability
   and NAPL distributions are accurately known. This implies that the
   accuracy of model predictions at the field scale will be constrained by
   our ability to quantify soil heterogeneity and NAPL distribution. (C)

Abstract = {{Diffusion, sorption and biodegradation are key processes impacting the
   efficiency of natural attenuation. While each process has been studied
   individually, limited information exists on the kinetic coupling of
   these processes. In this paper, a model is presented that couples
   nonlinear and nonequilibrium sorption (intraparticle diffusion) with
   biodegradation kinetics. Initially, these processes are studied
   independently (i.e., intraparticle diffusion, nonlinear sorption and
   biodegradation), with appropriate parameters determined from these
   independent studies. Then, the coupled processes are studied, with an
   initial data set used to determine biodegradation constants that were
   subsequently used to successfully predict the behavior of a second data
   set. The validated model is then used to conduct a sensitivity analysis,
   which reveals conditions where biodegradation becomes desorption
   rate-limited. If the chemical is not pre-equilibrated with the soil
   Drier to thc onset of biodegradation, then fast sorption will reduce
   aqueous concentrations and thus biodegradation rates. Another
   sensitivity analysis demonstrates the importance of including nonlinear
   sorption in a coupled diffusion/sorption and biodegradation model. While
   predictions based on linear sorption isotherms agree well with solution
   concentrations, for the conditions evaluated this approach overestimates
   the percentage of contaminant biodegraded by as much as 50\%. This
   research demonstrates that nonlinear sorption should be coupled with
   diffusion/sorption and biodegradation models in order to accurately
   predict bioremediation and natural attenuation processes. To our
   knowledge this study is unique in studying nonlinear sorption coupled
   with intraparticle diffusion and biodegradation kinetics with natural
   media. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solute travel time distributions were derived from breakthrough curves
   (BTCs) of bromide concentrations, which were measured during a
   large-scale tracer experiment in a quaternary fluviatile aquifer at
   Krauthuusen. Travel time distributions to a specific point in the
   aquifer were derived from locally measured BTCs, using averaged absolute
   concentrations (c) over cap (abs)(x(1),t), normalized concentrations (c)
   over cap (norm)(x(1),t), and velocity-weighted normalized concentrations
   (c) over cap (vw)(x(1),t). The travel time distributions were
   characterized in terms of equivalent convective-dispersive transport
   parameters: the equivalent solute velocity and equivalent dispersivity.
   Parameters were derived from BTCs using moment analyses and
   least-squares fits of the 1-D convection-dispersion equation (CDE).
   Both local and averaged BTCs showed pronounced tailing which was not
   well described by the 1-D CDE and which indicates the presence of
   macroscopic regions with low velocities in the aquifer. Therefore,
   dispersivities derived from CDE fits were significantly smaller than
   those derived from time moments. The BTCs of (c) over cap (abs)(x(1),t)
   were dominated by only a few local BTCs with high concentrations and
   were less representative fur the travel time distribution than BTCs of
   averaged normalized concentrations. Dispersivities derived from (c) over
   cap (norm)(x(1),t) and (c) over cap (vw)(x(1),t) were very similar.
   Finally, estimates of dispersivities and vertical correlation length of
   in K, gamma (3), from BTCs were in agreement with a first-order estimate
   of the dispersivity and gamma (3) based on grain size data and flow
   meter measurements. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Remediation of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) by conventional
   pump-and-treat methods (i.e., water flushing) is generally considered to
   be ineffective due to low watts solubilities of NAPLs and to
   mass-transfer constraints. Chemical flushing techniques, such as
   surfactant flushing, can greatly improve NAPL remediation primarily by
   increasing the apparent solubility of NAPL contaminants. NAPLs at
   hazardous waste sites are often complex mixtures. However, the
   equilibrium and nonequilibrium mass-transfer characteristics between
   NAPL mixtures and aqueous surfactant solutions are not weil understood.
   This research investigates the equilibrium solubilization behavior of
   two- and three-component NAPL mixtures (containing akylbenzenes) in
   biosurfactant solutions. NAPL solubilization is found to be ideal in
   water (i.e., obeys Raoult's Law), while solubilization in biosurfactant
   solutions was observed to be nonideal. Specifically, the relatively
   hydrophobic compounds in the mixture experienced solubility enhancements
   that were greater than those predicted by ideal enhanced solubilization
   theory, while the solubility enhancements for the relatively hydrophilic
   compounds were less than predicted. The degree of nonideality is shown
   to be a nonlinear function of the NAPL-phase mole fraction. Empirical
   relationships based on the NAPL-phase mole fraction and/or
   micelle-aqueous partition coefficients measured in single-component NAPL
   systems are developed to estimate values fur the multicomponent
   partition coefficients. Empirical relationships that incorporate birth
   thr NAPL-phase mole fraction and single-component partition coefficients
   yield much improved estimates for the multicomponent partition

Abstract = {{A fractional advection-dispersion equation (ADE) is a generalization of
   the classical ADE in which the second-order derivative is replaced with
   a fractional-order derivative. In contrast to the classical ADE, the
   fractional ADE has solutions that resemble the highly skewed and
   heavy-tailed breakthrough curves observed in field and laboratory
   studies. These solutions, known as alpha -stable distributions, are the
   result of a generalized central limit theorem which describes the
   behavior of sums of finite or infinite-variance random variables. We use
   this limit theorem in a model which sums the length of particle jumps
   during their random walk through a heterogeneous porous medium. If the
   length of solute particle jumps is not constrained to a representative
   elementary volume (REV), dispersive flux is proportional to a fractional
   derivative. The nature of fractional derivatives is readily visualized
   and their parameters are based on physical properties that are
   measurable. When a fractional Fick's law replaces the classical Fick's
   law in an Eulerian evaluation or solute transport in a porous medium,
   the result is a fractional ADE. Fractional ADEs are ergodic equations
   since they occur when a generalized central limit theorem is employed.

Abstract = {{A pore network model with cubic chambers and rectangular tubes was used
   to estimate the nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) dissolution rate
   coefficient, K(diss)a(i), and NAPL/water total specific interfacial
   area, a(i), K(diss)a(i) was computed as a function of modified Peclet
   number (Pe') for various NAPL saturations (S-N) and a(i) during drainage
   and imbibition and during dissolution without displacement. The largest
   contributor to a(i) was the interfacial area in the water-filled corners
   of chambers and tubes containing NAPL. When K(diss)a(i) was divided by
   a(i), the resulting curves of dissolution coefficient, K-diss versus Pe'
   suggested that an approximate value of K-diss could he obtained as a
   weak function of hysteresis or S-N. Spatially and temporally variable
   maps of K(diss)a(i) calculated using the network model were used in
   field-scale simulations of NAPL dissolution. These simulations were
   compared to simulations using a constant value of K(diss)a(i) and the
   empirical correlation of Powers et al. {[}Water Resour. Res. 30(2)
   (1994b) 321]. Overall, a methodology was developed fut. incorporating
   pore-scale processes into field-scale prediction of NAPL dissolution.

Abstract = {{Aerobic biodegradation of benzoate by Pseudomonas cepacia sp. in a
   saturated heterogeneous porous medium was simulated using the
   stochastic-convective reaction (SCR) approach. A laboratory flow cell
   was randomly packed with low permeability silt-size inclusions in a high
   permeability sand matrix. In the SCR upscaling approach, the
   characteristics of the flow field are determined by the breakthrough of
   a conservative tracer. Spatial information on the actual location of the
   heterogeneities is not used. The mass balance equations governing the
   nonlinear and multicomponent reactive transport are recast in terms of
   reactive transports in each of a finite number of discrete streamtubes.
   The streamtube ensemble members represent transport via a steady
   constant average velocity per streamtube and a conventional Fickian
   dispersion term, and their contributions to the observed breakthroughs
   are determined by flux-averaging the streamtube solute concentrations.
   The resulting simulations were compared to those from a high-resolution
   deterministic simulation of the reactive transport, and to alternative
   ensemble representations involving (i) effective Fickian travel time
   distribution function, (ii) purely convective streamtube transport, and
   (iii) streamtube ensemble subset simulations. The results of the SCR
   simulation compare favorably to that of a sophisticated high-resolution
   deterministic approach. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All lights

Abstract = {{Assessment of chemical contamination at large industrial complexes with
   long and sometimes unknown histories of operation represents a
   challenging environmental problem. The spatial and temporal complexity
   of the contaminant may be due to changes in production processes,
   differences in the chemical transport, and the physical heterogeneity of
   the soil and aquifer materials. Traditional mapping techniques are of
   limited value for sites where dozens of chemicals with diverse transport
   characteristics may be scattered over large spatial areas without
   documentation of disposal histories. In this context, a site with a long
   and largely undocumented disposal history of shallow groundwater
   contamination is examined using principal component analysis (PCA). The
   dominant chemical groups and chemical ``modes{''} at the site were
   identified. PCA results indicate that five primary and three transition
   chemical groups can be identified in the space of the first three
   eigenvectors of the correlation matrix, which account for 61\% of the
   total variance of the data. These groups represent a significant
   reduction in the dimension of the original data (116 chemicals). It is
   shown that each group represents a class of chemicals with similar
   chemo-dynamic properties and/or environmental response. Finally, the
   groups are mapped back onto the site map to infer delineation of
   contaminant source areas for each class of compounds. The approach
   serves as a preliminary step in subsurface characterization, and a data
   reduction strategy for source identification, subsurface modeling and
   remediation planning. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   determine the macroscopic and the microscopic inter face length are
   given. Lab experiments of dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)
   penetrating into water-saturated glass beads were carried out in a
   two-dimensional (2-D) transparent chamber. The displacement processes
   were recorded using a 35-mm camera or a video camera, which was directly
   connected to and controlled by a computer.
   Unlike the method of Chang et al. (1994), the modified method used here
   gives a constant value of the effective interfacial tension over time,

Abstract = {{The US Department of Energy (DOE), with technical assistance from Sandia
   National Laboratories, has successfully received EPA certification and
   opened the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a nuclear waste disposal
   facility located approximately 42 km east of Carlsbad, NM. Performance
   assessment (PA) analyses indicate that human intrusions by inadvertent,
   intermittent drilling for resources provide the only credible mechanisms
   for significant releases of radionuclides from the disposal system. For
   long-term brine releases, migration pathways through the permeable
   layers of rock above the Salado formation are important. Major emphasis
   is placed on the Culebra Member of the Rustler Formation because this is
   the most transmissive geologic layer overlying the WIPP site. In order
   to help quantify parameters for the calculated releases, radionuclide
   transport experiments have been carried out using intact-core columns
   obtained from the Culebra dolomite member of the Rustler Formation
   within the WIPP site. This paper deals primarily with results of
   analyses for Pu-241 and Am-241 distributions developed during transport
   experiments in one of these cores. Transport experiments were done using
   a synthetic brine that simulates Culebra brine at the core recovery
   location (the WIPP air-intake shaft (AIS)). Hydraulic characteristics
   (i.e., apparent porosity and apparent dispersion coefficient) for
   intact-core columns were obtained via experiments using the conservative
   tracer Na-22. Elution experiments carried out over periods of a few days
   with tracers U-232 and Np-239 indicated that these tracers were weakly
   retarded as indicated by delayed elution of the species. Elution
   experiments with tracers Pu-241 and Am-241 were attempted but no elution
   of either species has been observed to date, including experiments of
   many months' duration. In order to quantify retardation of the
   non-eluted species Pu-241 and Am-241 after a period of brine flow,
   non-destructive and destructive analyses of one intact-core column were
   carried out to determine distribution of these actinides in the rock.
   Analytical results indicate that the majority of the Am-241 remained
   very near the injection surface of the core (possibly as a precipitate),
   and that the majority of the Pu-241 was dispersed with a very high
   apparent retardation value. The Pu-241 distribution is interpreted using
   a single-porosity advection-dispersion model. and an approximate
   retardation value is reported. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A fast method to determine rock matrix diffusion properties directly in
   the bedrock would be valuable in the investigation of a possible site
   for disposal of nuclear waste. An ``effective diffusivity borehole

   entity over the area studied. As opposed to traditional matrix diffusion
   laboratory experiments. electrical conductivity measurements are fast,
   inexpensive and also easy to carry out in-situ.
   In this study, electrical resistivity data from borehole logging, as
   well as from measurements on the actual core, is evaluated with the
   purpose of extracting matrix diffusivity data. The influence of
   migration of ions in the electrical double layer, which can be of great
   importance in low ionic strength pore water. is also considered in
   evaluating the in-situ data to accurately determine the effective pore
   diffusivity. The in-situ data compare fairly well to those measured in

Abstract = {{The present Spanish concept of a deep geological high level waste
   repository includes an engineered clay barrier around the canister. The
   clay presents a very high sorption capability for radionuclides and a
   very small hydraulic conductivity, so that the migration process of
   solutes is limited by sorption and diffusion processes. Therefore,
   diffusion and distribution coefficients in compacted bentonite (i.e. in
   ``realistic{''} liquid to solid ratio conditions) are the main
   parameters that have to be obtained in order to characterise solute
   transport that could be produced after the canister breakdown.
   Through-Diffusion (TD) and In-Diffusion (ID) experiments with HTO, Sr,
   Cs and Se were carried out using compacted FEBEX bentonite, which is the
   reference material for the Spanish concept of radioactive waste
   disposal. Experiments were interpreted by means of available analytical
   solutions that allow the estimation of diffusion coefficients and, in
   some cases, distribution coefficients. Analytical solutions are simple
   to use, but rely on hypotheses that do not hold in all the experiments.
   These experiments were interpreted also using an automatic parameter
   estimation code that overcomes the limitations of analytical solutions.
   Numerical interpretation allows the simultaneous estimation of porosity,
   diffusion and distribution coefficients, accounts for the role of porous
   sinters and time-varying boundary concentrations, and can use different
   types of raw concentration data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Different approaches for measuring the interaction between radionuclides
   and rock matrix are needed to test the compatibility of experimental
   retardation parameters and transport models used in assessing the safety
   of the underground repositories for the spent nuclear fuel. In this
   work, the retardation of sodium, calcium and strontium was studied on
   mica gneiss, unaltered, moderately altered and strongly altered tonalite
   using dynamic fracture column method. In-diffusion of calcium into rock
   cubes was determined to predict retardation in columns. In-diffusion of
   calcium into moderately and strongly altered tonalite was interpreted
   using a numerical code FTRANS. The code was able to interprete
   in-diffusion of weakly sorbing calcium into the saturated porous matrix,
   Elution curves of calcium for the moderately and strongly altered
   tonalite fracture columns were explained adequately using FTRANS code
   and parameters obtained from in-diffusion calculations. In this paper,
   mass distribution ratio values of sodium, calcium and strontium for
   intact rock are compared to values, previously obtained for crushed rock
   from batch and crushed rock column experiments. Kd values obtained from
   fracture column experiments were one order of magnitude lower than Kd

Abstract = {{Diffusion of neptunium (V) in compacted Na-montmorillonite was studied
   through the non-steady state diffusion method. In this study, two
   experimental attempts were carried out to understand the diffusion
   mechanism of neptunium. One was to establish the diffusion activation
   energy, which was then used to determine the diffusion process in the
   montmorillonite. The other was the measurement of the distribution of
   neptunium in the montmorillonite by a sequential batch extraction. The
   apparent diffusion coefficients of neptunium in the montmorillonite at a
   dry density of 1.0 Mg m(-3) were from 3.7 x 10(-1)2 m(2) s(-1) at 288 K
   to 9.2 X 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) at 323 K. At a dry density of 1.6 Mg m(-3),
   the apparent diffusion coefficients ranged between 1.5 X 10(-13) m(2)
   s(-1) at 288 K and 8.7 X 10(-13) m(2) s(-1) at 323 K. The activation
   energy for the diffusion of neptunium at a dry density of 1.0 Mg m(-3)
   was 17.5 +/- 1.9 kJ mol(-1). This value is similar to those reported for
   diffusion of other ions in free water. e.g., 18.4 and 17.4 kJ mol(-1)
   for Na+ and Cl-, respectively. At a dry density of 1.6 Mg m(-3), the
   activation energy was 39.8 +/- 1.9 kJ mol(-1). The change in the
   activation energy suggests that the diffusion process changes depending
   on the dry density of the compacted montmorillonite. A characteristic
   distribution profile was obtained by the sequential extraction procedure
   for neptunium diffused in compacted montmorillonite. The estimated
   fraction of neptunium in the pore water was between 3\% and 11\% at a
   dry density of 1.6 Mg m(-3) and at a temperature of 313 K. The major
   fraction of the neptunium in the montmorillonite was identified as
   neptunyl ions sorbed on the outer surface of the montmorillonite. These
   findings suggested that the activation energy for diffusion and the
   distribution profile of the involved nuclides could become powerful
   parameters in understanding the diffusion mechanism. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{For safety assessment of geological disposal of HLW, it is necessary to
   understand the diffusion mechanism of radionuclides in compacted
   bentonite. In this study, the diffusion behavior of chloride ions in
   compacted montmorillonite was studied from the viewpoints of the
   activation energy for apparent diffusion and the basal spacing of the
   compacted montmorillonite. A unique change in the activation energy as a
   function of the dry density of the montmorillonite was found. The
   activation energy decreased from 17.4 to 13.5 kJ mol(-1) as the dry
   density increased from 0.7 The basal to 1.0 Mg m(-3) and increased to
   25.1 kJ mol(-1) at dry densities above 1.0 Mg m spacing of 1.88 nm,
   corresponding to the three-water layer hydrate state, was not observed
   by X-ray diffraction (XRD) until the dry density increased to 1.0 Mg
   m(-3). where the minimum activation energy was obtained. On the other
   hand, a basal spacing of 1.56 nm, corresponding to the two-water layer
   hydrate state, was observed at the dry densities of 1.4 Mg m(-3) and
   above, where the activation energies were more than 22 kT mol(-1). These
   experimental results suggest that there are at least two additional
   diffusion processes that can raise or reduce the activation energy and
   are affected by water in the region adjacent to the montmorillonite
   surfaces. If the ``Grahame model{''} can be introduced to describe the
   electrical double layer, surface diffusion will be considered the
   possible predominant diffusion process, even for anions like chloride
   ions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption and desorption behavior of radium on bentonite and purified
   smectite was investigated as a function of pH. ionic strength and liquid
   to solid ratio by batch experiments. The distribution coefficients (K-d)
   were in the range of 10(2) to > 10(4) mi g(-1) and depended on ionic
   strength and pH. Most of sorbed Ra was desorbed by 1 M KCl. The results
   for purified smectite indicated that Ra sorption is dominated by ion
   exchange at layer sites of smectite, and surface complexation at edge
   sites may increase Ra sorption at higher pH region. Reaction parameters
   between Ra and smectite were determined based on an interaction model
   between smectite and groundwater. The reaction parameters were then used
   to explain the results of bentonite by considering dissolution and
   precipitation of minerals and soluble impurities. The dependencies of
   experimental Kd values on pH, ionic strength and liquid to solid ratio
   were qualitatively explained by the model. The modeling result for
   bentonite indicated that sorption of Ra on bentonite is dominated by ion
   exchange with smectite. The observed pH dependency was caused by changes
   of Ca concentration arising from dissolution and precipitation of
   calcite. Diffusion behavior of Ra in bentonite was also investigated as
   a function of dry density and ionic strength. The apparent diffusion
   coefficients (D-a) obtained in compacted bentonite were in the range of
   1.1 X 10(-11) to 2.2 X 10(-12) m(2) s(-1) and decreased with increasing
   in dry density and ionic strength. The K-d values obtained by measured
   effective diffusion coefficient(D-e) and modeled D-e were consistent
   with those by the sorption model in a deviation within one order of
   magnitude. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural colloids in groundwater could facilitate radionuclide transport,
   provided the colloids are mobile, are present in sufficient
   concentrations and can adsorb radionuclides, This paper describes the
   results of a laboratory migration study carried out with combinations of
   radionuclides and natural colloids within a fracture in a large granite
   block to experimentally determine the impact of colloids on radionudide
   transport. The Sr-85 used in this study is an example of a moderately
   sorbing radionuclide, while the Am-241 is typical of a strongly sorbed
   radionuclide with very low solubility, The natural colloids used in this
   study were isolated from granite groundwater from Atomic Energy of
   Canada (AECL) Underground Research Laboratory (URL), and consisted of
   mostly 1-10 nm organic colloids, along with lesser amounts of 10-450 nm
   colloids (organics and aluminosilicates), The measured coefficients for
   radionuclide sorption onto these colloids were between 3 x 10(2) and 1 X
   10(3) ml/g for Sr-85, and between 7 X 10(4) and 7 X 10(5) mg/l for
   Am-241, The Sr-85 sorption on the natural colloids appeared to be
   reversible. Migration experiments in the granite block were carried out
   by establishing a flow field between two boreholes tout of a total of
   nine) intersecting a main horizontal fracture. These experiments showed
   that dissolved 85Sr behaved as a moderately sorbing tracer, while
   dissolved Am-241 was completely adsorbed by the fracture surfaces and
   showed no evidence of transport. However, when natural colloids were
   injected together with dissolved Am-241, a small amount of Am-241
   transport was observed, demonstrating the ability of natural colloids to
   facilitate the transport of radionuclides with low solubility. Natural
   colloids had only a minor effect on the transport of Sr-85. In a
   separate experiment to test the effect of higher colloid concentrations
   on Sr-85 migration, synthetic colloids were produced from Avonlea
   bentonite. The introduction of a relatively high concentration of
   bentonite colloids actually reduced Sr-85 transport because, compared to
   natural colloids, the bentonite colloids were less mobile and they
   sorbed Sr-85 more strongly. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Subsurface transport of groundwater contaminants is greatly influenced
   by chemical speciation, precipitation and sorption processes at the
   mineral-water interface. The retardation of contaminants is often
   greatest at boundaries between minerals and in fractures and pore
   spaces, The investigation of the spatial distribution of sorbed
   contaminants along these boundaries requires micro-analytical
   techniques. The sorption of dissolved Pu(V) on a natural zeolitic tuff
   from Yucca Mountain (NV, USA) was examined using microautoradiography
   (MAR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microprobe (EM) techniques, and
   synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (micro-SXRF). The tuff
   contained a heterogeneous distribution of zeolites and trace quantities
   of smectites, Fe oxides (hematite), and Mn oxides (ranciete), which are
   present as fracture fill and pore space materials. Micro-SXRF studies
   showed that Pu is mostly associated with bodies of smectite plus Mn
   oxides, which were typically elevated in Ce. Ga, Nb, Pb, Y, Ca, Ti, and
   Zn. Sorbed Pu was not associated with Fe-rich bodies, which were
   enriched in Cl and Rb. Results of the MAR studies were complementary to
   that of the micro-SXRF studies in that Pu was associated with similar
   elements in the tuff. Indirect detection of Pu by EM or micro-SXRF (by
   analyzing Ag developed on the MAR photoemulsion) was a more sensitive
   method for detecting lower levels of sorbed Pu than the direct detection
   of sorbed Pu via micro-SXRF in the absence of the photoemulsion. (C)

Abstract = {{The sorption of U(VI) onto low-grade metamorphic rock phyllite was
   modeled with the diffuse double layer model (DDLM) using the primary
   mineralogical constituents of phyllite, i.e. quartz, chlorite,
   muscovite, and albite, as input components, and as additional component,
   the poorly ordered Fe oxide hydroxide mineral, ferrihydrite.
   Ferrihydrite forms during the batch sorption experiment as a weathering
   product of chlorite. In this process, Fe(II). leached from the chlorite,
   oxidizes to Fe(III), hydrolyses and precipitates as ferrihydrite. The
   formation of ferrihydrite during the batch sorption experiment was
   identified by Mossbauer spectroscopy, showing a 2.8\% increase of
   Fe(III) in the phyllite powder. The ferrihydrite was present as Fe
   nanoparticles or agglomerates with diameters ranging from 6 to 25 nm,
   with indications for even smaller particles. These Fe colloids were
   detected in centrifugation experiments of a ground phyllite suspension
   using various centrifugal forces.
   The basis for the successful interpretation of the experimental sorption
   data of uranyl(VI) on phyllite were: (1) the determination of surface
   complex formation constants of uranyl with quartz, chlorite, muscovite,
   albite, and ferrihydrite in individual batch sorption experiments, (2)
   the determination of surface acidity constants of quartz, chlorite,
   muscovite, and albite obtained from separate acid-base titration, (3)
   the determination of surface site densities of quartz, chlorite,
   muscovite, and albite evaluated independently of each other with
   adsorption isotherms, and (4) the quantification of the secondary phase
   ferrihydrite, which formed during the batch sorption experiments with
   phyllite. The surface complex formation constants and the protolysis
   constants were optimized by using the experimentally obtained data sets
   and the computer code FITEQL. Surface site densities were evaluated from
   adsorption isotherms at pH 6.5.}},

Abstract = {{Cs-137 was dispersed globally by cold war activities and, more recently,
   by the Chernobyl accident. Engineered extraction of Cs-137 from soils
   and groundwaters is exceedingly difficult. Cs-137 is only 30.2 years,
   remediation might be more effective land less Because the half-life of
   costly) if Cs-137 bioavailability could be demonstrably limited for even
   a few decades by use of a reactive barrier. Essentially permanent
   isolation must be demonstrated in those few settings where high nuclear
   level wastes contaminated the environment with Cs-135 (half-life 2.3 x
   10(-6) years) in Cs-137. Clays are potentially a low-cost barrier to Cs
   movement, though their long-term addition to effectiveness remains
   untested. To identify optimal clays for Cs retention, Cs desorption was
   measured for five common clays: Wyoming Montmorillonite (SWy-1), Georgia
   Kaolinites (KGa-1 and KGa-2), Fithian Illite (F-III), and
   K-Metabentonite (K-Mbt). Exchange sites were pre-saturated with 0.16 M
   CsCl for 14 days and readily exchangeable Cs was removed by a series of
   LiNO3 and LiCl washes. Washed clays were then placed into dialysis bags
   and the Cs release to the deionized water outside the bags measured.
   Release rates from 75 to 139 days for SWy-1, K-Mbt and F-III were
   similar; 0.017\% to 0.021\% sorbed Cs released per day. Both kaolinites
   released Cs more rapidly (0.12\% to 0.05\% of the sorbed Cs per day). In
   a second set of experiments, clays were Cs-doped for 110 days and
   subjected to an extreme and prolonged rinsing process. All the clays
   exhibited some capacity for irreversible Cs uptake. However, the
   residual loading was greatest on K-Mbt (similar to 0.33 wt.\% Cs). Thus,
   this clay would be the optimal material for constructing artifical
   reactive barriers. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Uranium(VI) sorption experiments involving quartz and clinoptilolite,
   important mineral phases at the proposed US nuclear waste repository at
   Yucca Mountain, NV, were conducted to evaluate the ability of surface
   complexation models: to predict U-VI sorption onto mineral mixtures
   based on parameters derived from single-mineral experiments. The
   experiments were conducted at an initial U-VI aqueous concentration of
   similar to 2.0 X 10(-7) mol L-1 (0.1 mol . 1-(1) NaNO3 matrix) and over
   the pH range similar to 2.5 to similar to 9.5. The U-VI solutions were
   reacted with tither quartz or clinoptilolite only, or with mixtures of
   the two minerals. The experiments were carried out under atmospheric
   pCO(2)(g) conditions tin loosely capped containers) or under limited
   pCO(2)(g) tin capped containers or in a glove box).
   Data from sorption experiments on quartz at atmospheric pCO(2)
   conditions were used to derive U-VI binding constants for a
   diffuse-layer surface complexation model (DLM). The DLM was then used
   with surface area as a scaling factor to predict sorption of U-VI onto
   clinoptilolite and clinoptilolite/quartz mixtures under both atmospheric
   and low pCO(2) conditions. The calculations reproduced many aspects of
   the pH-dependent sorption behavior. If this: approach can be
   demonstrated for natural mineral assemblages, it may be useful as a
   relatively simple method for improving radionuclide transport models in
   performance-assessment calculations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Sorption and diffusivity of iodide and pertechnetate (I- and TcO4-) on
   MX-80 bentonite with different hexadecylpyridinium (HDPy+) loadings were
   studied using equilibrium solutions of different ionic strengths. In
   HDPy+-modified bentonite, iodide and pertechnetate ions exhibited
   increasing sorption (characterized by the distribution ratio, R-d),
   while Cs+ and Sr2+ showed decreasing sorption with increasing
   organophilicity. In case of medium-loading levels, the simultaneous
   sorption of anions (I- and TcO4-) and cations (Cs+ and Sr2+) was
   observed.
   Sorption of ions was influenced by the composition of the electrolytes
   employed. It decreased gradually with increasing ionic strength of the
   electrolyte solutions.
   The experiments revealed the general tendency that the diffusivity (D-a
   {[}cm(2).s(-1)]) for iodide and pertechnetate decreases with increasing
   organophilicity and increases with increasing ionic strength of the
   equilibrium solutions, confirming the results of the sorption
   experiments.
   Additionally, some mineralogical and chemical investigations, like IR
   spectral analysis of the organo-bentonite samples and exchange behavior
   of HDPy+, were performed. On the basis of these analyses, it was
   concluded that the alkylammonium ions are sorbed as (1) HDPy+ cations,
   (2) HDPyCl molecules and (3) micelles with decreasing binding
   intensities in this order. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A first step towards understanding and controlling the fate and
   dissemination of radioactive waste is to create a concise and
   comprehensive theoretical framework for the rather non-linear processes
   involved - hence, the need for geochemical models. Two classes of
   geochemical models are commonly used. i.e., static and hydrodynamic
   models. In contrast to static models, hydrodynamic models combine
   geochemical reactions with hydrogeological processes such as
   ground-water flow, diffusion and dispersion. In this review, we examine
   the present state of geochemical models in terms of included processes,
   thermodynamic databases, missing phenomena, numerical behavior and
   performance. It is shown that over the past decade, significant progress
   has been made with respect to modeling of geochemistry in hydrodynamic
   systems: this is illustrated by describing several applications.
   Finally, we focus on the perspectives of geochemical modeling in the
   assessment of the safety of nuclear waste disposal. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic sorption model and a diffusion model based on electric
   double layer (EDL) theory are integrated to yield a surface chemical
   model that treats porewater chemistry, surface reactions, and the
   influence of charged pore walls on diffusing ions in a consistent
   fashion. The relative contribution of Stern and diffuse layer to the
   compensation of the permanent surface charge represents a key parameter;
   it is optimized for the diffusion of Cs in Kunipia-F bentonite, at a dry
   density of 400 kg/m(3). The model is then directly used to predict
   apparent diffusivities (D-a) of Cs, Sr, Cl-, I- and TcO4- and
   corresponding distribution coefficients (K-d) of Cs and Sr in different
   bentonites as a function of dry density, without any further adjustment
   of surface chemical and EDL parameters. Effective diffusivities (D-e)
   for Cs, HTO, and TcO4- are also calculated. All calculated values (D-a,
   D-e, K-d) are fully consistent with each other. A comparison with
   published, measured data shows that the present model allows a good
   prediction and consistent explanation of (i) apparent and effective
   diffusivities for cations. anions, and neutral species in compacted
   bentonite, and of (ii) K-d values in batch and compacted systems. (C)

Abstract = {{Microbial reactions play an important role in regulating pore water
   chemistry as well as secondary mineral distribution in many subsurface
   systems and, therefore, may directly impact radionuclide migration in
   those systems. This paper presents a general modeling approach to couple
   microbial metabolism redox chemistry, and radionuclide transport in a
   subsurface environment. To account for the likely achievement of
   quasi-steady state biomass accumulations in subsurface environments, a
   modification to the traditional microbial growth kinetic equation is
   proposed. The conditions for using biogeochemical models with or without
   an explicit representation of biomass growth are clarified. Based on the
   general approach proposed in this paper, the couplings of uranium
   reactions with biogeochemical processes are incorporated into computer
   code BIORXNTRN Version 2.0. The code is then used to simulate a
   subsurface contaminant migration scenario, in which a water flow
   containing both uranium and a complexing organic ligand is recharged
   into an oxic carbonate aquifer. The model simulation shows that Mn and
   Fe oxyhydroxides may vary significantly along a flow path. The
   simulation also shows that uranium(VI) can be reduced and therefore
   immobilized in the anoxic zone created by microbial degradation. (C)

Abstract = {{The humic colloid borne Am(III) transport was investigated in column
   experiments for Gorleben groundwater/sand systems. It was found that the
   interaction of Am with humic colloids is kinetically controlled, which
   strongly influences the migration behavior of Am(III). These kinetic
   effects have to be taken into account for transport/speciation modeling.
   The kinetically controlled availability model (KICAM) was developed to
   describe actinide sorption and transport in laboratory batch acid column
   experiments. Application of the KICAM requires a chemical
   transport/speciation code. which simultaneously models both kinetically
   controlled processes and equilibrium reactions. Therefore. the code KID
   was developed as a flexible research code that allows the inclusion of
   kinetic data in addition to transport features and chemical equilibrium.
   This paper presents the verification of K1D and its application to model
   column experiments investigating unimpeded humic colloid borne Am
   migration. Parameters for reactive transport simulations were determined
   for a Gorleben groundwater system of high humic colloid concentration
   (GoHy 2227). A single set of parameters was used to model a series of
   column experiments. Model results correspond well to experimental data
   for the unretarded humic borne Am breakthrough. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The natural system is expected to contribute to isolation at the
   proposed high-level nuclear waste (HLW) geologic repository at Yucca
   Mountain, NV (YM). In developing performance assessment (PA) computer
   models to simulate long-term behavior at YM, colloidal transport of
   radionuclides has been proposed as a critical factor because of the
   possible: reduced interaction with the geologic media. Site-specific
   information on the chemistry and natural colloid concentration of
   saturated zone groundwaters in the vicinity of YM is combined with a
   surface complexation sorption model to evaluate the impact of natural
   colloids on calculated retardation factors (R-F) for several
   radioelements of concern in PA. Inclusion of colloids into the
   conceptual model can reduce the: calculated effective retardation
   significantly. Strongly sorbed radionuclides such as americium and
   thorium are most affected by pseudocolloid formation and transport, with
   a potential reduction in R-F of several orders of magnitude.
   Radioelements that are less strongly sorbed under YM conditions. such as
   uranium and neptunium, are not affected significantly by colloid
   transport. and transport of plutonium in the + 5 valence state is only
   moderately enhanced. Model results showed no increase in the peak mean
   annual total effective dose equivalent (TEDE) within a compliance period
   of 10,000 years, although this: is strongly dependent on container life
   in the base case scenario. Ar longer times, simulated container failures
   increase and the TEDE from the colloidal models increased by a factor of
   60 from the base case. By using mechanistic models and sensitivity
   analyses to determine what parameters and transport processes affect the
   TEDE, colloidal transport in future versions of the TPA code can be
   represented more accurately. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   Radionuclide Migration Programme has now been on-going for over a decade
   in Nagra's Grimsel Test Site (GTS). The main aim of the programme has
   been the direct testing of radionuclide transport models in as realistic
   manner as possible. Although it will never be possible to fully test
   these models due to the large time and distance scales involved, tests
   of the model assumptions in scaled down but otherwise realistic
   conditions will contribute to developing confidence in the predictive
   power of the models.
   In this paper, the Nagra/JNC approach is highlighted with examples from
   a large programme of field, laboratory and natural analogue studies
   based around the GTS. The successes and failures are discussed as in the
   general approach to the thorough testing of predictive transport codes
   which will be used in repository performance assessment (PA). Some of
   the work is still on-going and this represents the first presentation of
   a unique set of results and conclusions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

   (IGC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the effects
   of nuclear tests at the: atolls of Mururoa and Fangataufa, release to
   the biosphere is estimated for 35 radionuclides originating from 147
   nuclear underground tests. Based on a qualitatively characterised
   hydrogeological situation of atolls and relatively scarce site-specific
   data, a model chain was developed to conservatively estimate the
   radionuclide fluxes via groundwater, from their sources, the explosion
   cavities. towards the biosphere, the ocean or lagoon.
   Finite element hydro-thermal modelling was used to describe water flow.
   Parameters were calibrated by a very few measured pre-test temperature
   profiles in bore holes. The impact of the tests on groundwater flow and
   mechanical impact on rock was considered. Estimates were made to
   quantify spatial extensions and temporal evolution of impact by using
   measurements on refilling rate of the cavities. Tests were categorised
   according to their specific yield and location although detailed data
   were missing. A base case parameter set was defined for the hydraulic
   conditions and for the initial radionuclide inventory of individual
   tests. Models were used to describe the concentration of radionuclides
   in the cavities as a function of time. Radionuclide transport from the
   cavities to the biosphere was represented by two different approaches: a
   double porosity model for the fractured volcanic rock and a single
   porosity model for the overlaying, highly porous carbonates. Results
   consist of conservative estimates on radionuclide release into the
   environment, or concentration in the lagoon or ocean water. Their
   sensitivity was investigated using different models and parameters. A
   few measured data (concentrations in a few cavities, in the deep
   carbonates and in the lagoons for selected radionuclides, such as H-3,
   C-14, Cl-36, Sr-90, I-129, Cs-137(239), Pu-240 and Am-241) were
   available for a comparison with the calculations. In view of the lack
   and uncertainty of site-specific data, the agreement is of acceptable
   quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As a basis for an analysis of the effect of rock heterogeneity on
   radionuclide migration in a single fracture, the geostatistics of the
   main properties governing solute transport in crystalline rock have been
   determined experimentally for two granitic rock types. The rock samples
   were collected at the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory, Sweden and used to
   deduce the auto-covariance functions for the porosity, effective
   diffusivity and partition coefficient, k(d). and adsorption kinetics.
   One-dimensional analytical solutions for the mean values of the temporal
   moments of the residence time probability density function (PDF) show
   that the heterogeneity of the rock properties can have a substantial
   impact on the transport, A case study of the effect of heterogeneity in
   matrix diffusion for a single fracture could be performed by decomposing
   the transport problem into a one-dimensional mass transfer problem and a
   two-dimensional flow problem using a Lagrangian method of description.
   Monte Carlo simulations of the flow field indicate that the correlation
   length of the aperture is much longer along the trajectory paths than
   along an arbitrary direction. Increasing the correlation lengths and
   variances of the aperture and matrix diffusion increases significantly
   the variance of the travel time PDF. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{The couplings among chemical reaction rates, advective and diffusive
   transport in fractured media or soils, and changes in hydraulic
   properties due to precipitation and dissolution within fractures and in
   rock matrix are important for both nuclear waste disposal and
   remediation of contaminated sites. This paper describes the development
   and application of LEHGC2.0, a mechanistically based numerical model for
   simulation of coupled fluid flow and reactive chemical transport,
   including both fast and slow reactions in variably saturated media.
   Theoretical bases and numerical implementations are summarized, and two
   example problems are demonstrated. The first example deals with the
   effect of precipitation/dissolution on fluid flow and matrix diffusion
   in a two-dimensional fractured media. Because of the precipitation and
   decreased diffusion of solute from the fracture into the matrix,
   retardation in the fractured medium is not as large as the case wherein
   interactions between chemical reactions and transport are not
   considered. The second example focuses on a complicated but realistic
   advective-dispersive-reactive transport problem. This example
   exemplifies the need for innovative numerical algorithms to solve
   problems involving stiff geochemical reactions. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An effective streamtube ensemble method is: developed to upscale
   convective-dispersive transport with multicomponent nonlinear reactions
   in steady nonuniform flow. The transport is cast in terms of a finite
   ensemble of independent discrete streamtubes that approximate convective
   transport along macroscopically averaged pathlines and dispersive
   transport longitudinally as microscopic mixing within streamtubes. The
   representation of fate and transport via a finite ensemble of effective
   linear streamtubes, allows the treatment of arbitrarily complex reaction
   systems involving both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions, and
   longitudinal dispersive/diffusive mixing within streamtubes. This allows
   the use of reactive-transport codes designed to solve such problems in
   an Eulerian framework, as opposed to reliance on closed-ti,rm
   (convolutional or canonical) expressions for reactive transport in
   exclusively convective streamtubes. The approach requires both
   reactive-transport solutions for a representative ensemble of
   one-dimensional convective-dispersive-reactive streamtubes and the
   distribution of flux over the streamtube ensemble variants, and it does
   not allow fur lateral mixing between streamtubes. Here, the only
   ensemble variant is travel time. The discussion details the way that the
   conventional Eulerian fate and transport model is converted first into
   an ensemble of transports along three-dimensional streamtubes of unknown
   geometry, and then to approximate one-dimensional streamtubes that an
   designed to honor the important global properties of the transport.
   Conditions under which such an `equivalent' ensemble of one-dimensional
   streamtubes are described. The breakthrough curve of a nonreactive
   tracer in the ensemble is expressed as a combined Volterra-Fredholm
   integral equation, which serves as the basis for estimation of the
   distribution of flux over the variant of the ensemble, travel time.
   Transient convective speed and the effects of errors in flux
   distributions are described, and the method is applied to a
   demonstration problem involving nonlinear multicomponent reaction
   kinetics and strongly nonuniform flow. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{We analyze a set of observations from a recently published, field-scale
   tracer test in a fractured till. These observations demonstrate a
   dominant, underlying non-Fickian behavior, which cannot be quantified
   using traditional modeling approaches. We use a continuous time random
   walk (CTRW) approach which thoroughly accounts for the measurements, and
   which is based on a physical picture of contaminant motion that is
   consistent with the geometric and hydraulic characterization of the
   fractured formation. We also incorporate convolution techniques in the
   CTRW theory, to consider transport between different regions containing
   distinct heterogeneity patterns. These results enhance the possibility
   that limitations in predicting non-Fickian modes of contaminant
   migration can be overcome. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights:

Abstract = {{One of the most common methods to dispose of domestic wastewater
   involves the release of septic effluent from drains located in the
   unsaturated zone. Nitrogen from such systems is currently of concern
   because of nitrate contamination of drinking water supplies and
   eutrophication of coastal waters. The objectives of this study are to
   develop and assess the performance of a mechanistic flow and reactive
   transport model which couples the most relevant physical, geochemical
   and biochemical processes involved in wastewater plume evolution in
   sandy aquifers. The numerical model solves for variably saturated
   groundwater flow and reactive transport of multiple carbon- and
   nitrogen-containing species in a three-dimensional porous medium. The
   reactive transport equations are solved using the Strang splitting
   method which is shown to be accurate for Monod and first- and
   second-order kinetic reactions, and two to four times more efficient
   than sequential iterative splitting. The reaction system is formulated
   as a fully kinetic chemistry problem, which allows for the use of
   several special-purpose ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers.
   For reaction systems containing both fast and slow kinetic reactions,
   such as the combined nitrogen-carbon system, it is found that a
   specialized stiff explicit solver fails to obtain a solution. An
   implicit solver is more robust and its computational performance is
   improved by scaling of the fastest reaction rates. The model is used to
   simulate wastewater migration in a 1-m-long unsaturated column and the
   results show significant oxidation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
   the generation of nitrate by nitrification, and a slight decrease in pH.

Abstract = {{A multicomponent reactive transport model as presented by MacQuarrie and

   Multicomponent simulation of wastewater-derived nitrogen and carbon in
   shallow unconfined aquifers: I. Model formulation and performance. J.
   Contam. Hydrol.] is applied to a well-studied wastewater plume in a
   sandy aquifer near Cambridge. Ontario. Domestic wastewater is released
   into the unsaturated zone via a drain field at a depth of about 0.8 m.
   The physical transport parameters for the model are obtained by
   simulating a non-reactive solute, while kinetic input data for the
   nitrogen and carbon reaction network are obtained from the literature.
   The model shows that the wastewater-loading rate has little influence on
   the moisture content in the unsaturated zone, thus oxygen diffusion in
   the air phase is an important transport mechanism. The model results are
   in general agreement with the field-determined moisture and oxygen
   profiles near the drain field. The simulation results show that
   oxidation of ammonium and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) goes to
   completion in the 1.5-m distance between the drain field and the water
   table, and that calcite dissolution limits the pH reduction to about 0.2
   units. The model-predicted nitrate concentrations in the core of the
   plume are in the range of 20-25 mg N/l and are in good agreement with
   the field data. Overall. the results for the major reactive species from
   the model simulation agree well with the geochemical data obtained below
   the drain field and it is concluded that the major physical and
   biochemical processes have been correctly captured in the current model
   formulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous porous media with low permeability lenses can produce
   contaminant plumes with extended tails, Highly asymmetric breakthrough
   curves cannot be described well by an advection-dispersion equation
   (ADE) with a uniform velocity and dispersion coefficient. The character
   of such a solute plume depends on many factors, including plume size,
   the geometry and arrangement of the low permeability inclusions, and the
   transport through such regions. We develop an inclusion Peclet number
   that effectively characterizes the relative importance of advection and
   diffusion for transport within a low permeability lens. This inclusion
   Peclet number is a function of the far-field velocity, the effective
   diffusion coefficient, the length scale of the inclusion, and the ratio
   of the permeability of the lens to that of the surrounding matrix. We
   investigate the effects of a single, elliptical inclusion on the arrival
   of a solute at a downgradient control plane with numerical pal-tide
   tracking. Effects specific to advection or diffusion dominance within
   the inclusion are subtle: diffusion gives rise to more distributed
   tailing whereas advection produces behavior that is more abrupt. These
   slight differences are nor enough to allow one to determine the dominant
   process within the inclusion by observing the first three temporal
   moments alone. The time scale for the dominant transport process within
   the inclusion is the primary factor affecting the contaminant tailing.
   For high inclusion Peclet numbers (when advection dominates), the
   characteristic time varies with the permeability contrast, the far-field
   velocity, and the size and geometry of the inclusion. For low inclusion
   Peclet numbers (when diffusion dominates), the characteristic time
   varies with the size of the inclusion and the effective diffusion
   coefficient. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil vapour transport to indoor air is an important potential exposure
   pathway at many sites impacted by subsurface volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs). The inclusion of biodegradation in vadose zone transport models
   for benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) and fuel hydrocarbons has been
   proposed; however, there is still significant uncertainty regarding
   biodegradation rates and the local effects of buildings or ground
   surface cover on fate and transport processes. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate biodegradation processes through comprehensive
   monitoring at a site contaminated with BTX and model simulation. Study
   methods included extensive vertical profiling of BTX vapour and light
   gas (oxygen and carbon dioxide) concentrations and moisture content, and
   semi-continuous monitoring of oxygen and pressure below a building floor
   slab. Significant vadose zone biodegradation over a relatively small
   depth interval was observed. Based on the observed soil vapour profile,
   first-order biodegradation rates were estimated by fitting an analytical
   solution fur diffusion and biodecay to the data. Degradation rates were
   found to compare well to other reported laboratory and field data. A
   two-dimensional (2-D) numerical model incorporating vapour-phase
   diffusion, advection, sorption and biodegradation was used to simulate
   the effect of a building floor slab on transport processes. Model
   results demonstrate the sensitivity of vapour-phase BTX and oxygen
   transport to partial barriers to diffusion (e.g. building foundation)
   and highlight the importance of using a model that ties biodecay to
   oxygen availability. In addition, depressurization within a building and
   advective transport is shown to have a potentially significant effect on
   BTX late, in soil below. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The need for measuring dynamic fluid saturation distribution in
   multi-dimensional three-fluid phase flow experiments is hampered by lack
   of appropriate techniques to monitor full field transient flow
   phenomena. There is no conventional technique able to measure dynamic
   three-fluid phase saturation at several array points of the flow field
   at the same time. A multispectral image analysis technique was developed
   to determine dynamic NAPL, water and air saturation distribution in
   two-dimensional three-fluid phase laboratory experiments. Using a
   digital near-infrared camera, images of sand samples: with various
   degrees of NAPL, water and air saturation were taken, under constant
   lighting conditions and within three narrow spectral bands of the
   visible and near-infrared spectrum. It was shown that the optical
   density defined for the reflected luminous intensity was a linear
   function of the NAPL and the water saturation for each spectral band and
   for any two and three-fluid phase systems. This allowed the definition
   of dimensionless lump reflection coefficients for the NAPL and the:
   water phase within each spectral band. Consequently, at any given time,
   two images taken within two different spectral bands provided two linear
   equations which could he solved for the water and the NAPL saturation.
   The method was applied to two-dimensional three-phase flow experiments,
   which were conducted to investigate the migration and the distribution
   of LNAPL in the vadose zone. The method was used to obtain continuous,
   quantitative and dynamic full field mapping of the NAPL saturation as
   well as the variation of the water and the air saturation during NAPL
   flow. The method provides a non-destructive and non-intrusive tool for
   studying multiphase flow for which rapid changes in fluid saturation in
   the entire flow domain is difficult to measure using conventional
   techniques. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of the transport properties of fluid-saturated
   joints composed of two complementary rough fracture surfaces, translated
   with respect to each other and brought in contact, is reported.
   Quantitative roughness measurements on different fractured granite
   samples show that the surfaces have a self-affine geometry from which
   the dependence of the mean aperture on the relative displacement of
   fracture surfaces kept in contact can be predicted. Variations of the
   hydraulic and electrical conductances of the joint are measured as
   functions of its mean aperture. A simple parallel plane model accounts
   for the global trend of the measurements, but significant deviations are
   observed when a relative lateral displacement of the surfaces is
   introduced. A theoretical analysis of their origin shows that they are
   due both to the randomness of the aperture field and to a nonzero local
   slope of the surface near the injection hole: the corresponding
   conductivity fluctuation amplitudes have power law and linear variations
   with the lateral displacement, and are enhanced by the radial injection
   geometry. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate modeling of multicomponent sorption and transport of major
   cations in subsurface porous media is a prerequisite for predicting
   complex environmental processes, such as the movement of trace metals in
   soils and aquifers. In this study, various cation exchange models were
   compared in their ability to predict ternary Ca-Mg-Na transport in an
   acidic soil from binary Ca, Mg, and Na adsorption data. A flow-through
   reactor technique was used to measure binary adsorption isotherms of Ca,
   Mg, and Na over wide concentration ranges of the adsorptive and the
   respective background cations. High-resolution transport experiments
   were conducted in water-saturated chromatographic glass columns. Three
   sorption models based on cation exchange equations were compared: a
   1-site Gaines-Thomas (1-GT), a 1-site Rothmund-Kornfeld (1-RK), and a
   3-site Gaines-Thomas (3-GT) model. Although the fit of adsorption data
   was clearly improved, from the 1-GT to the 1-RK to the 3-GT model,
   transport predictions were overall not improved compared to the 1-GT
   model. While predictions by the 1-GT and the 3-GT model were virtually
   identical, predictions by the 1-RK model were partly improved and partly
   deteriorated. The most simple 1-GT model, therefore, seems to be
   adequate for predicting multicomponent transport phenomena involving
   major cations, however, multi-site models may be useful for predicting
   transport of trace metals in the presence of several major cations.
   Regardless of the model used, accurate determination of the cation
   exchange capacity at the pH conditions of interest is extremely critical
   in cation transport modeling. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Biodegradation of organic contaminants in groundwater is a microscale
   process which is often observed on scales of 100s of metres or larger.
   Unfortunately, there are no known equivalent parameters for
   characterizing the biodegradation process at the macroscale as there
   are, for example, in the case of hydrodynamic dispersion. Zero- and
   first-order degradation rates estimated at the laboratory scale by model
   fitting generally overpredict the rate of biodegradation when applied to
   the field scale because limited electron acceptor availability and
   microbial growth are not considered. On the other hand, Field-estimated
   zero- and first-order rates are often not suitable for predicting plume
   development because they may oversimplify or neglect several key field
   scale processes. phenomena and characteristics. This study uses the
   numerical model BIO3D to link the laboratory and field scales by
   applying laboratory-derived Monod kinetic degradation parameters to
   simulate a dissolved gasoline field experiment at the Canadian Forces
   Base (CFB) Borden. All input parameters were derived from independent
   laboratory and field measurements or taken from the literature a priori
   to the simulations. The simulated results match the experimental results
   reasonably well without model calibration. A sensitivity analysis on the
   most uncertain input parameters showed only a minor influence on the
   simulation results. Furthermore, it is shown that the flow field, the
   amount of electron acceptor (oxygen) available, and the Monod kinetic
   parameters have a significant influence on the simulated results, it is
   concluded that laboratory-derived Monod kinetic parameters can
   adequately describe field scale degradation, provided all controlling
   factors are incorporated in the field scale model. These factors include
   advective-dispersive transport of multiple contaminants and electron
   accepters and large-scale spatial heterogeneities. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The ability of an aqueous polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate
   solution to solubilize a residual trichloroethene (TCE) saturation,
   present as a trapped dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL), was studied
   in a series of column experiments. Different flow regimes and stopflow
   scenarios were applied. No mobilization of the DNAPL was observed,
   leading to the assumption that the only recovery mechanism was a
   surfactant enhanced micellar solubilization of the TCE molecules. The
   solubilization of TCE by the surfactant solution was observed to be
   rate-limited under the applied conditions and the exchange rate depended
   on pore water velocity and volumetric DNAPL content. A phenomenological
   power-law model between the mass transfer rate and the pr,re water
   velocity and volumetric DNAPL content was implemented in a numerical
   model to describe DNAPL dissolution, advection and dispersion in the
   water phase. The applied model accounts for non-flow dissolution. The
   obtained mass transfer rate parameters provide a good fit to the
   experimental data also for no-flow conditions. Compared to other mass
   transfer rate models the obtained relationship predicts lower mass
   transfer rates and an intercept in case of zero flow. (C) 2000 Elsevier

   All four models make comparable predictions for the plume centerline
   concentrations of the primary contaminants in the aquifer for a distance
   of up to about 300 m from the source. MEPAS, MMSOILS, and RESRAD make
   similar predictions for the transverse concentration profiles in the
   aquifer. The four models make considerably different predictions for the
   temporal concentration profiles of the progeny in the aquifer. The
   profiles differ in shape, magnitude of the peak, and in width. The
   differences are a result of the simplifying assumptions underlying each

Abstract = {{We modelled lithium transport through an undisturbed solid waste sample
   and a pilot-scale experimental landfill by use of the same probabilistic
   Lagrangian approach. The waste sample contained 3.5 m(3) of old,
   well-degraded waste, and the experimental landfill 545 m(3) of fresh
   municipal waste. In the waste sample, four tracer tests were performed
   under either constant water head or sprinkling input boundary
   conditions, and either steady state or transient flow. All experimental
   breakthrough curves (BTCs) exhibit greater spreading than can be
   explained by a local dispersion mechanism, even when combined with
   diffusive mass transfer between mobile and immobile water. The observed
   non-uniform flow and transport could only be represented meaningfully by
   a two-domain conceptual model, assuming mobile water and advective
   solute transport both through preferential flow paths and in zones of
   slow flow. In the undisturbed waste sample, the preferential flow
   quantification implies that 55-70\% of the total infiltrated water moves
   through only 5-16\% of the total water content. In the landfill, it is
   90\% of the vertically Rowing water that moves preferentially through
   47\% of the total water content. The difference between the landfill and
   the waste sample: appears to be: related to waste material properties
   (which may vary both between and within different waste systems) rather
   than to the prevailing flow conditions (average flow rare or degree of
   saturation). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of the presence of PAHs and coal tar on naphthalene sorption

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{61-80}},

Abstract = {{The mobility of the most water-soluble polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) such as naphthalene in contaminated soils from manufactured gas
   plant (MGP) sites or other similar sites is influenced not, only by the
   naturally occurring soil organic matter (SOM) but also, and in many
   cases mostly, by the nature and concentration of coal tar. xenobiotic
   organic matter (XOM) and other PAH molecules present in the medium under
   various physical states. The objective of the present study was to
   quantify the effects of these factors using batch experiments, in order
   to simulate naphthalene transport in soil-tar-water systems using column
   experiments. Naphthalene sorption was studied in the presence of (i)
   solid coal tar particles, (ii) phenanthrene supplied as pure crystals,
   in the aqueous solution or already sorbed onto the soil, (iii)
   fluoranthene as pure crystals, and (iv) an aqueous solution of organic
   molecules extracted from a liquid tar. All experiments were conducted
   under abiotic conditions using short naphthalene/sorbent contact times
   of 24-60 h. Although these tests do not reflect true equilibrium
   conditions which usually rake more time to establish, they were used to
   segregate relatively rapid sorption phenomena ({''}pseudo
   equilibrium{''}) from slow sorption and other aging phenomena. For
   longer contact times, published data have shown that experimental biases
   due to progressive changes in the characteristics of the soil and the
   solution may drastically modify the affinity of the solutes for the
   soil. Slow diffusion in the microporosity and in dense organic phases
   may also become significant over the long term, along with some
   irreversible aging phenomena which have not been addressed in this work.
   Results showed that pAHs had no effect on naphthalene sorption when
   present in the aqueous solution ol as pure crystals, due to their low
   solubility in water. Adsorbed phenanthrene was found to reduce
   naphthalene adsorption only when present at relatively high
   concentrations (about 120 mg/kg) in the soil. In contrast, experiments
   carried out with coal tar particles revealed a significant effect.
   Naphthalene sorption appeared to be proportional to the amount of coal
   tar added to the sand or soil, and a much higher affinity of naphthalene
   for XOM (K-oc above 2000 cm(3)/g) than SOM (K-oc around 300 cm(3)/g) was
   observed. Naphthalene transport in the columns of sand or soil spiked
   with coal tar particles was simulated very satisfactorily with a dual
   double-domain model. Around 90\% of naphthalene retention by coal tar
   was found to occur within the organic phase, suggesting a phase
   partition process which may be explained by the amorphous nature of the
   XOM and its extreme affinity fur naphthalene. For SOM, however, which is
   present as porous microaggregates of clay and humic substances, with
   less affinity for naphthalene, only 1/3 of naphthalene retention was
   found to occur within the organic phase, underlining the significant
   role of surface adsorption in the short term behavior of naphthalene in
   soil. For longer contact times, the model simulations proposed in the
   present study should be coupled to slow sorption, aging and
   biodegradation models to describe long-term behavior of naphthalene in
   soil-tar-water systems. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   unacceptably high concentrations of nitrate in the groundwater.
   Stimulated in situ denitrification was considered a possible solution to
   the: problem. In advance of a planned field test. the effectiveness of
   various electron donors (acetate, hydrogen gas, elemental sulphur,
   thiosulphate, aqueous ferrous iron and pyrite) at stimulating
   denitrification was compared in microcosm experiments involving sediment
   from the Baden aquifer. All electron donors tested, with the possible
   exception of pyrite, stimulated nitrate removal from solution. Acetate
   was found to be the substance that stimulated the quickest initial
   removal rates, and denitrification was confirmed as the mechanism using
   the acetylene block technique. Nitrite accumulation was minimal in most
   systems, although the local water quality guideline limit of 1.0 mg/l
   NO2--N was briefly and temporarily exceeded (maximum value was 1.2 mg/l)
   in some of the acetate amended microcosms. Granular iron was also
   considered as an electron donor or abiotic reducing agent, but was found
   to reduce nitrate predominantly to ammonium, in a neutral pH solution
   buffered with pyrite. In mixed granular iron aquifer sediment systems,
   where: several electron donors were present (hydrogen, ferrous iron and
   pyrite) that could have supported denitrification. the abiotic reaction
   with the granular iron appeared to dominate other transformation
   pathways, and ammonium was again the major product. Based on the testing
   completed as part of this project, the aquifer at Baden is considered a
   good candidate for acetate-stimulated in situ denitrification for the
   removal of nitrate from the groundwater near the municipal water supply
   well. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Predictions of subsurface radionuclide transport are used to support the
   groundwater pathway analysis for the performance assessment of the
   low-level, solid radioactive waste site at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory. Detailed process-based models rather than higher-level
   performance-assessment models are used to perform the transport
   calculations. The deterministic analyses predict the fate of the waste
   from its sour ce. through the vadose zone, into the saturated zone and,
   finally, the potential dose to humans at the accessible environment. The
   calculations are run with the finite-element code FEHM, which simulates
   fluid now, heat transport, and reactive, contaminant transport through
   porous and Fractured media.
   The modeling approach for this study couples realistic source-term
   models with an unsaturated-zone flow and transport model, which is then
   linked to the saturated-zone flow and transport model. The
   three-dimensional unsaturated-zone flow and transport model describes
   the complex hydrology associated with the mesa-top and volcanic geology
   of the site. The continued mi,oration of nuclides into the main;aquifer
   is calculated using a three-dimensional, steady-flow, saturated zone
   model that maintains the spatial and temporal distribution of nuclide
   flux from the vadose zone. Preliminary results for the aquifer-related
   dose assessments show that doses are well below relevant performance
   objectives for low-level waste sites.
   A general screening technique that compares the nuclide's half-life to
   its unsaturated-zone travel time is described. This technique helps to
   decrease the number of transport calculations required at a site. In
   this case, over half the nuclides were eliminated from further
   consideration through this screening. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to develop the single-well push-pull
   test as a diagnostic tool fur assessing the potential for cation
   exchange to adversely affect the phase behavior of sodium dihexyl
   sulfosuccinate surfactant (Aerosol MA 80-I) and its solubilization of
   trichloroethene (TCE) in the subsurface. Laboratory push-pull tests were
   conducted on a model natural aquifer sediment collected fi um a
   TCE-contaminated field site and a test solution consisting of 36,800
   mg/l (3.7 wt.\%) sulfosuccinate, 100,000 mg/l (10 wt.\%) isopropanol,
   and 3200 mg/l (0.32 wt.\%) KBr. Laboratory experiments: were designed to
   simulate conditions occurring during single-well, ``push-pull{''} tests.
   In batch experiments conducted in the presence of excess TCE, the test
   solution gave a Winsor Type I system with an enhanced aqueous TCE
   solubility of 26,700 mg/l and a solution density of 1.000 g/cm(3). The
   sulfosuccinate surfactant was transported conservatively in sediment
   packs containing no TCE. However, increasing concentrations of Ca2+ and
   Mg2+ resulting from cation exchange caused the TCE solubilization
   potential of the injected surfactant to exceed values predicted from the
   solubilization isotherm. Sulfosuccinate surfactant transport was
   strongly retarded in sediment packs containing 5 vol.\% residual TCE
   because cation exchange resulted in the formation of a Winsor Type II
   system, which resulted in the partitioning of the sulfosuccinate
   surfactant into the residual TCE phase. Conservative sulfosuccinate
   transport was observed in a separate sediment pack containing 5 vol.\%
   residual TCE when a 130 meq/l Na+ pre-flush was used to reduce
   quantities of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the sediment pack prior to sulfosuccinate
   injection. The results of this study emphasize the importance of cation
   exchange an the performance of surfactant-enhanced TCE solubilization
   and demonstrate the utility of the push-pull test for predicting the
   potentially deleterious effects of cation exchange on surfactant phase
   behavior in the presence of residual TCE. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{A general methodology has been developed for investigating the effect of
   short-term temporal variability in infiltration on the long-term
   transport of contaminants in soils. A one-dimensional, unsaturated
   transport model was used to simulate the transport of a sorbing,
   nonvolatile solute, using either steady-state or randomly varying
   infiltration. Concentration breakthrough curves are plotted against time
   and cumulative infiltration for constant rainfall, and for five,
   random-rainfall realizations, The observed time-based breakthrough
   curves for an individual year depend significantly on the actual
   rainfall pattern for that year. The average breakthrough curve,
   generated from many years of randomly generated rainfall, approaches the
   constant infiltration time breakthrough curve. For an individual year,
   the cumulative infiltration breakthrough curves for variable and
   constant infiltration match closely, as suggested by Wierenga, P.J.
   {[}Wierenga, P.J., 1977. Solute distribution profiles computed with
   steady-state and transient water movement models. Soil Sci. Sec. nm. J.,
   41, 1050]. This indicates that, for the conditions examined, cumulative
   rainfall can be used to predict adequately contaminant transport for a
   given time period. Under more severe conditions, increased variability
   in infiltration is expected to increase dispersion. A dimensional
   analysis of the governing equations indicates two additional
   explanations for the influence of infiltration variability on
   contaminant transport. First, the hydraulic conductivity (and therefore,
   the velocity) and retardation factor depend on the soil water content,
   which depends on the infiltration pattern. Second, molecular diffusion
   dominates transport during dry periods. The impact of this diffusion on
   the overall contaminant transport depends on the: duration of dry
   periods. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A response function approach is used to generate semi-analytical
   solutions to model the transport of species within a first-order
   reaction network. If the retardation coefficients of these species are
   not the same, product species will either be delayed or displaced
   forward relative to the reactants. A novel approach is used to simulate
   linear, kinetic response functions (KRFs) for species in plug flow, then
   to integrate with the conservative residence time density function
   (E-curve) to yield a residence time density for the reacted species.
   This kinetic E-curve can be used with linear operator methods such as
   convolution to yield the semi-analytical solution for nonuniform inputs,
   nonideal mixing, and complex reaction networks. Closed-form analytical
   solutions are presented for the linear response functions for straight,
   three-member reaction networks in plug flow. Only irreversible reactions
   are considered. Several examples with various mixing conditions are
   shown and compared to other analytical solutions. Although the approach
   is related to other transfer function models, the kinetic residence time
   density is a transfer function that is generated directly from the
   plug-flow response functions and the numerical evaluation of the
   E-curve, The advantage is that a wide variety of mixing conditions and
   reaction networks may be considered without the need to generate
   analytical transfer functions for each species and mixing condition. (C)

Abstract = {{Soil coring and vertically and horizontally installed suction cup
   monitoring techniques were compared during a field release experiment
   conducted in an urban area of the Swan Coastal Plain of Western
   Australia. Sodium bromide and low concentrations of diazinon,
   chlorpyrifos, atrazine and fenamiphos were released into the vadose zone
   and rater of migration and mass loss with respect to a bromide tracer
   investigated. Only bromide and atrazine showed significant migration
   through the vadose zone. The relative hall-life mass losses from the
   vadose zone of the pesticides ranged from 3 to > 40 days.
   The use of soil coring complemented the use of vertically and
   horizontally installed suction cups For investigating relatively mobile
   non-volatile compounds, such as atrazine. Data from horizontally
   installed suction cups accounted for mass losses due to dilution and
   transport that could not be accounted for by coring, and enabled a
   better estimate of degradation and migration rates through the vadose
   tune. From core data alone, atrazine migration rates for the first 0.25
   m were underestimated by more than 50\% (0.0039 in day(-1) compared to
   0.013 m day(-1)), and removal rates (and inferred degradation rates)
   were overestimated by more than 100\% (half-lift: of 14 days compared to
   a half-life of 40 days), compared with rates determined by using core
   data and horizontal suction cup data in combination. Migration rates may
   have been even further underestimated at greater depths. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Evaluation of redox conditions in groundwater pollution plumes is often
   a prerequisite for understanding the behaviour of the pollutants in the
   plume and for selecting remediation approaches. Measuring of redox
   conditions in pollution plumes is, however, a fairly recent issue and
   yet relative few cases have been reported. No standardised or generally
   accepted approach exists. Slow electrode kinetics and the common lack of
   internal equilibrium of redox processes in pollution plumes make, with a
   few exceptions, direct electrochemical measurement and rigorous
   interpretation of redox potentials dubious, if not erroneous. Several
   other approaches have been used in addressing redox conditions in
   pollution plumes: redox-sensitive compounds in groundwater samples,
   hydrogen concentrations in groundwater, concentrations of volatile fatty
   acids in groundwater, sediment characteristics and microbial tools, such
   as MPN counts, PLFA biomarkers and redox bioassays. This paper reviews
   the principles behind the different approaches, summarizes methods used
   and evaluates the approaches based on the experience from the reported
   applications. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory-scale tracer experiments were conducted to investigate the
   geochemical and hydrological processes that govern the fate and
   transport of organically chelated radionuclides and toxic metals in
   undisturbed saturated columns of weathered, fractured shale saprolite.
   Three long-term, reactive contaminant injections were pulsed onto three
   separate soil columns, with the following influent mixtures: (1)
   (109)CdEDTA(2-), (2) (109)CdEDTA(2-) and Co-57,Co-58(II)EDTA(2-), and
   (3) (109)CdEDTA(2-), Co-57(III)EDTA(-), and (HCrO4-)-Cr-51. Both single
   and multiple species experiments were conducted to determine the
   importance of interaction between the contaminants and competition for
   surface sites. Flow interruption was used to identify physical and
   chemical non-equilibrium (PNE and CNE) which were caused by multiple
   pore-region flow and rate-limited chemical reactions, respectively.
   Reactive contaminant transport through the fractured, weathered shale
   was affected by sorption, redox, and dissociation reactions, which were
   mediated by soil organic matter and surficial oxides of Fe, Mn, and Al.
   The transport of CdEDTA(2-) was significantly influenced by
   ligand-promoted dissolution of subsurface Fe and Al sources, resulting
   in the liberation of Cd2+, Al(III)EDTA(-) and Fe(III)EDTA(-). Flow
   interruption confirmed that the surface-mediated dissociation reaction
   was time-dependent, with the stability of the CdEDTA(2-) complex
   dependent on its residence time within the soil. The migration of
   Co(II)EDTA(2-) was dominated by oxidization to the highly stable
   Co(III)EDTA(-) species, and elevated effluent Mn2+ suggested that
   surficial Mn(IV) oxides likely catalyzed the redox reaction, though
   Fe-oxides may have also contributed to the reaction. Dissociation (12\%)
   of the Co(II)EDTA(2-) complex was first observed during flow
   interruption indicating that rate-limited dissociation of the complex by
   Fe-oxides may be significant under equilibrium conditions. The transport
   of HCrO4- was significantly altered by the reduction of mobile Cr(VI) to
   irreversibly bound Cr(III). The reduction reaction was catalyzed by
   surface-bound natural organic matter and flow interruption confirmed
   that the reaction was time-dependent. There was little evidence of
   competitive effects between the various contaminants in the multispecies
   experiments, since each was influenced by a different geochemical
   process during transport through the soil. The results of this study
   further support research findings that suggest anionic toxic metals and
   radionuclide-organic complexes can be significantly influenced by soil
   geochemical processes that can both enhance and impede the subsurface
   migration of these contaminants. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{To assess the performance of a modified slurry wall material,
   laboratory-scale contaminant transport experiments were conducted with
   trichloroethylene (TCE) and soil-bentonite (SB) amended with the
   addition of natural humus, Low-flow column studies were performed using
   flexible wall permeameters, with the primary emphasis on the measurement
   of spatial contaminant distributions from columns operated for different
   durations. Batch experiments were also performed to assess the sorption
   characteristics of the modified SB. Penetration of TCE into the amended
   SB was significantly retarded, suggesting that the addition of
   organic-rich material can be an effective strategy for improving barrier
   performance. The advective-dispersive-reactive equation (ADRE) gave good
   predictions of the observed contaminant spatial distributions in the
   columns provided that nonequilibrium sorption was included in the model
   formulation. The calibrated TCE diffusion coefficient corresponded to a
   porosity-corrected hindrance factor of 2.7, which is similar to other
   studies of barrier materials. However, the sorption distribution
   coefficient estimated from the column data was approximately one half
   the value measured in the batch isotherm test. Although the reason for
   this discrepancy was not identified, the results suggest that caution
   should be exercised in extrapolating the performance of strongly sorbing
   barrier materials from batch test data. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{Groundwater plumes often contain a mixture of contaminants that cannot
   easily be remediated in situ using a single technology. The purpose of
   this research was to evaluate an in situ treatment sequence for the
   control of a mixed organic plume (chlorinated ethenes and petroleum
   hydrocarbons) within a Funnel-and-Gate. A shallow plume located in the
   unconfined aquifer at Alameda Point, CA, was found to contain up to
   218,000 mu g/l of cis-1,2 dichloroethene (cDCE), 16,000 mu g/l of vinyl
   chloride (VC) and < 1000 mu g/l of 1,1 dichloroethene (1,1 DCE),
   trans-1,2 dichloroethene (trans-1,2 DCE) and trichloroethene (TCE).
   Total benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) concentrations
   were < 10,000 mu g/l. Contaminated groundwater was funneled into a gate,
   3.0 m wide, 4.5 m long and 6.0 m deep (keyed into the underlying
   aquitard) where treatment occurred. The initial gate segment consisted
   of granular iron, for the reductive dechlorination of the higher
   chlorinated ethenes. The second segment, the biosparge zone, promoted
   aerobic biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and any remaining
   lesser-chlorinated compounds, stimulated by dissolved oxygen (DO) and
   carbon dioxide (CO2) additions via an in situ sparge system (CO2 was
   used to neutralize the high pH produced from reactions in the iron
   wall). Groundwater was drawn through the gate by pumping two wells
   located at the sealed, downgradient, end. Over a 4-month period an
   estimated 1350 g of cDCE flowed into the treatment gate and the iron
   wall removed 1230 g, or 91\% of the mass. The influent mass of VC was
   572 g and the iron wall removed 535 g, corresponding to 94\% mass
   removal. The other chlorinated ethenes had significantly lower influent
   masses (3 to 108 g) and the iron wall removed the majority of the mass
   resulting in > 96\% mass removal for any of the compounds. In spite of
   these high removal percentages, laboratory column tests indicated that
   at these levels of chlorinated contaminants, surface saturation of the
   iron grains likely contributed to lower than expected reaction rates. In
   the biosparge zone, mass removal of cDCE appeared to occur predominantly
   by biodegradation (65\%) with volatilization (35\%) being an important
   secondary process. The dominant removal process for VC was
   volatilization (70\%) although significant biodegradation was also
   indicated (30\%). Laboratory microcosm results confirmed the potential
   for aerobic biodegradation of cDCE and VC. When average influent field
   concentrations for cDCE and VC were 220,000 and 46,000 mu g/l,
   respectively, the sequential treatment unit removed 99.6\% of the total
   mass and when the influent concentrations decreased to 26,000 and 19,000
   mu g/l for cDCE and VC, respectively, > 99.9\% removal within the
   treatment gate was attained. BTEX compounds were found to be
   significantly retarded in the iron treatment zone. Although they did
   eventually break through the granular iron, and into the gravel
   transition zone, none of these compounds was detected in the biosparge
   zone. No noticeable interferences between the anaerobic (reductive) and
   aerobic parts of the system occurred during testing. The results of this
   experiment show that in situ treatment sequences are viable, although
   further work is needed to optimize performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Title = {{Inverse modeling to estimate LNAPL plume release timing}},

Abstract = {{Methodologies are presented for dating releases of light nonaqueous
   phase liquids (LNAPLs) using an inverse modeling approach with simple
   analytical models. Models for LNAPL plume migration are presented to
   predict LNAPL plume velocity in the unsaturated and saturated zones as a
   function of basic soil and fluid properties. A relative mobility factor
   is introduced for LNAPL movement at the water table that depends
   primarily on the van Genuchten n parameter (related to the breadth of
   the soil pore size distribution) and the magnitude of water table
   fluctuations. Estimated LNAPL plume velocities compare reasonably with
   more rigorous numerical models, which may be used in cases where data
   availability warrant the greater effort entailed.
   Two methods of estimating release timing and its uncertainty are
   investigated. A direct estimation method is described that determines
   travel time for a single observed travel distance based on estimated
   soil and fluid properties. Release date uncertainty may be determined
   using the first order (FO) or Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The second
   method for estimating release date involves nonlinear parameter
   estimation utilizing distance vs, time measurements and other data.
   A case study is presented for a field site where independent estimates
   of release timing were obtained from a numerical modeling analysis.
   Release timing estimates based on direct inversion of the analytical
   timing model agree well with the numerical analysis. Results for a
   second field site indicate that release date confidence limits estimated
   by the FO method, assuming log-normally distributed travel times, are
   close to values determined by the MC method, which makes no assumption
   regarding the form of the travel time probability distribution.
   Results for a hypothetical problem indicate that LNAPL velocity and
   travel time may be accurately estimated if sufficient data on travel
   distance vs, time are available. Incorporating prior information on
   relevant soil and fluid properties into the objective function reduces
   the uncertainty in release date if prior estimates are accurate.
   However, biased prior estimates may lead to over-or underestimation of
   release date uncertainty. Simultaneous estimation of soil and fluid
   properties and release date is possible if prior information is
   available to condition the parameter estimates. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A field-scale natural gradient tracer experiment with bromide, uranin
   and lithium was conducted in a heterogeneous aquifer at Krauthausen,
   Germany. The temporal and spatial evolution of the solute plumes was
   monitored over 398 days for bromide and 449 days for uranin and lithium.
   The spatial variability of basic aquifer parameters, hydraulic
   conductivity, and sorption parameters of the aquifer material was
   investigated in detail. Local Darcian velocities were measured using
   NH(4)Br(82) as a radioactive tracer in 33 observation wells. Vertical
   and horizontal correlation lengths of hydraulic properties were
   determined using variogram analysis. The magnitude of the local Darcian
   velocities was found to be lognormally distributed. In addition, the
   groundwater flow direction showed a clear trend in the vertical
   direction. The horizontal correlation length of the magnitude of Darcian
   velocity agreed with the correlation length of K estimated from grain
   size data. Batch experiments on aquifer sediments showed that sorption
   of uranin and lithium could be described by a Freundlich isotherm. The
   Freundlich n parameter of uranin sorption showed little variation with
   depth. The time evolution of the bromide plume was quantified in terms
   of spatial moments. The longitudinal effective dispersivity estimated
   from spatial moment analysis was within the range of calculated
   effective dispersivities, taking into account the uncertainty of
   estimates of the 1n K statistics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Forced-gradient groundwater tracer tests may be conducted using a
   variety of hydraulic schemes, so it is useful to have simple
   semi-analytic models available that can examine various
   injection/withdrawal scenarios. Models for radially convergent tracer
   tests are formulated here as transfer functions, which allow complex
   tracer test designs to be simulated by a series of simple mathematical
   expressions. These mathematical expressions are given in Laplace space,
   so that transfer functions may be placed in series by simple
   multiplication. Predicted breakthrough is found by numerically inverting
   the composite transfer function to the time-domain, using traditional
   computer programs or commercial mathematical software. Transport is
   assumed to be dictated by a radially convergent or uniform flow field,
   and is based upon an exact first-passage-time solution of the backward
   Fokker-Planck equation. These methods are demonstrated by simulating a
   weak-dipole tracer test conducted in a fractured granite formation,
   where mixing in the injection borehole is non-ideal. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Subsurface environmental, engineering, and agricultural investigations
   often require characterization of hydraulic parameters. For example,
   groundwater flow modeling is often performed through an aquifer whose
   hydrological properties have been created using stochastic simulation
   techniques; these techniques use as input both hydraulic parameter point
   values and spatial correlation structure information. Conventional
   sampling or borehole techniques for measuring these parameters are
   costly, time-consuming, and invasive. Geophysical data can compliment
   direct characterization data by providing multi-dimensional and high
   resolution subsurface measurements in a minimally invasive manner.
   Several techniques have been developed in the preceding decade for using
   joint geophysical-hydrological data to characterize the subsurface; the
   purpose of this study is to review three methodologies that we have
   recently developed for use with geophysical-hydrological data to
   estimate hydrological parameters and their spatial correlation
   structures. The first two methodologies presented focus on producing
   high-resolution estimates of hydrological properties using densely
   sampled geophysical data and limited borehole data. Although we find
   that high-resolution geophysical data are useful for obtaining these
   estimates, in practice, geophysical profiles often sample only a small
   portion of the aquifer under investigation, and thus, the estimates
   obtained from geophysical data may not be sufficient to completely
   describe the hydraulic properties of the aquifer volume. The third and
   last section focuses on using high-resolution tomographic data together
   with limited borehole data to infer the spatial correlation structure of
   log-permeability, which can be used within stochastic simulation
   techniques to generate parameter estimates at unsampled locations. Our
   synthetic case studies suggest that collection of a few tomographic
   profiles and interpretation of these profiles together with limited
   wellbore data can yield hydrological point Values and spatial
   correlation structure information that can be used to aid numerical
   aquifer model construction, calibration, and flow simulation As this
   information is typically only obtainable from extensive hydrological
   sampling, use of geophysical methods may offer a more efficient and less
   invasive approach than traditional characterization campaigns. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{This work explores the dissolution behavior of residual
   tetrachloroethylene (PCE) in chemically heterogeneous soils. A numerical
   solute transport simulator, that incorporates rate-limited dissolution
   and desorption using linear driving force expressions, was developed and
   applied to analyze soil column dissolution data and to conduct numerical
   dissolution experiments. Published mass transfer coefficients were
   unable to accurately predict the observed dissolution of entrapped PCE
   in fractional wettability porous media (media containing both water- and
   PCE-wet solid surfaces). A two-parameter power function expression for
   the lumped mass transfer coefficient was developed and successfully fit
   to these data. Correlations were then developed for the fitted mass
   transfer model parameters as a function of wettability and grain size
   distribution characteristics. The power function model: in conjunction
   with the parameter correlations, yielded reasonable predictions for
   long-term dissolution behavior in the more PCE-wetting media. Poorer
   predictions for the more water-wet materials were attributed to an
   increased sensitivity of effluent concentration behavior to temporal
   changes in PCE saturation in these systems. Many of the effluent
   concentration curves exhibited low and persistent concentration tailing
   after recovery of the separate phase PCE. This tailing behavior could be
   adequately modeled by incorporation of rate-limited desorption. Results
   from numerical experiments indicate that both the magnitude and spatial
   distribution of wettability can significantly influence PCE dissolution
   behavior and remediation time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Several innovative tracer techniques have been introduced during the
   past 5 years for enhanced characterization of the ``source zones{''} at
   sites contaminated with non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) wastes. These
   tracer techniques allow for an in situ estimation of domain-averaged
   values and spatial patterns for NAPL saturation (S-n), NAPL-water
   interfacial area (a(nw)), and bio-geochemical reactivity (k(s)) within
   the target test zone. The tracer tests can be used to evaluate the
   spatial patterns in these parameters, both before and after implementing
   some in situ technique for site cleanup, in order to evaluate the
   effectiveness of remediation achieved and the possible impacts of the
   cleanup technology on hydrodynamic and bio-geochemical processes. Here,
   we review the theoretical and experimental basis for these tracer
   methods, present selected examples of recent field-scale applications,
   and examine their reliability. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Partitioning tracer tests are often used to quantify the amount of
   non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) present in a porous medium. Results from
   such tests are usually interpreted by using models that assume local
   equilibrium exists between the NAPL and the aqueous phase or by using a
   moment method to solve for the fraction of the pore space occupied by
   the NAPL. We investigated the transport of partitioning alcohol tracers
   through heterogeneous sand porous medium systems containing a stationary
   trichloroethylene (TCE) phase for a range of aqueous phase velocities.
   NAPL saturations were quantified using a non-destructive X-ray
   absorption methodology. Experimental results were simulated using a
   numerical solution to an advective-dispersive model in which mass
   transfer between the NAPL and the aqueous phase was approximated using a
   dual-resistance approach consisting of a boundary layer mass transfer
   resistance and a diffusional resistance within the NAPL. The numerical
   model agreed well with the experimental data, and moment analysis
   yielded reasonable estimates of actual NAPL saturations. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Widespread use of petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents has
   resulted in contamination of soils and ground water supplies. This paper
   summarizes key technical and economic issues for surface active agent
   (surfactant)-enhanced remediation of such contamination episodes.
   Laboratory and field results are cited illustrating each of these key
   issues. Using the design of an upcoming field study as an example, we
   illustrate the importance of system solubility enhancement, interfacial
   tension, viscosity and density in selecting a surfactant system. We also
   show how a site-specific capillary curve can be used to optimize
   contaminant solubility (super solubilization) while mitigating
   mobilization and vertical migration. Finally, we demonstrate the
   potential of a surfactant gradient system to progressively increase the
   super-solubilization potential without mobilizing trapped oil. (C) 2000

   and SO4. Small-scale field studies have demonstrated treatment of Cd,
   Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, NO3, PO4 and SO4. Permeable reactive barriers
   composed of zero-valent iron have been used in fill-scale installations
   for the treatment of Cr, U, and Tc. Solid-phase organic carbon in the
   form of municipal compost has been used to remove dissolved constituents
   associated with acid-mine drainage, including SO4, Fe, Ni, Co and Zn.

Abstract = {{Flow and transport take place in a formation of spatially variable
   conductivity K(x). The latter is modeled as a lognormal stationary
   random space function. With Y = ln K, the structure is characterized by
   the mean {[}Y], the variance sigma(Y)(2), the horizontal and vertical
   integral scales I-h and I-v. The fluid velocity field V(x), driven by a
   constant mean head gradient, has a constant mean U and a stationary
   two-point covariance. Transport of a conservative solute takes place by
   advection and by pore-scale dispersion (PSD), that is assumed to be
   characterized by the constant longitudinal and transverse dispersivities
   alpha(dL) and alpha(dT). The local solute concentration C(x, t), a
   random function of space and time, is characterized by its statistical
   moments. While the mean concentration {[}C] was investigated extensively
   in the past, the aim here is to determine the variance sigma(C)(2), a
   measure of concentration fluctuations. This is achieved in a Lagrangean
   framework, continuous limit of the particle-tracking procedure, by
   adopting a few approximations. The present study is a continuation of a
   previous one (Dagan, G., Fiori, A., 1997. The influence of pore-scale
   dispersion on concentration statistical moments in transport through
   heterogeneous aquifers. Water Resour. Res., 33, 1595-1606) and extends
   it as follows: (i) it is shown that the indepence of the advective
   component of a solute particle trajectory from the trajectory component
   associated with PSD, is a rigorous first-order approximation in
   sigma(Y)(2). This independence, that was conjectured in the work of
   Dagan and Fiori (Dagan, G., Fiori, A., 1997. The influence of pore-scale
   dispersion on concentration statistical moments in transport through
   heterogeneous aquifers. Water Resour. Res., 33, 1595-1606), simplifies
   considerably the solution; (ii) the covariance of two-particle
   trajectories, needed in order to evaluate sigma(C)(2), is rederived,
   correcting for an error in the previous work. The general results are
   applied to determining CVC = sigma(C)/{[}C] at the center of a small
   solute body, of initial size much smaller than I-h = I-v, as function of
   sigma(gamma)(2), t' = tU/I and Pe = UI/D-dT = I/alpha(dT). Though PSD
   reduces considerably CVC as compared with advective transport (Pe =
   infinity), its value is still quite large for time intervals of interest
   in applications. This finding is in agreement with the analysis of field
   data by Fitts (Fitts, C.R., 1996. Uncertainty in deterministic
   groundwater transport models due to the assumption of macrodispersive
   mixing: evidence from the Cape Cod (Massachussets, USA) and Borden
   (Ontario, Canada) tracer tests. J. Contam. Hydrol., 23, 69-84). (C) 2000

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present semi-analytical solutions for two-dimensional
   equations governing transport of Light Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (LNAPL)
   in unconfined aquifers. The proposed model is based on sharp interface
   displacement and steady groundwater flow assumptions, where both the
   water-LNAPL interface and the LNAPL-air interface are represented as
   sharp interfaces. In the case of steady groundwater flow, these
   equations can be reduced to a two-dimensional nonlinear solute transport
   equation, with the LNAPL thickness in the free product lens being the
   primary unknown variable. The linearized form of this solute transport
   equation falls into the category of two-dimensional transport equation
   with time-dependent dispersion coefficients. This equation can be solved
   analytically for an infinite domain region. In this paper, the general
   form of the analytical solution for the transport equation, as well as
   the solutions for some specific cases are presented. To demonstrate the
   utility of the proposed solution, numerical results obtained for two
   example problems are discussed and presented comparatively with a
   finite-element solution and other more restrictive solutions available
   in the literature. Although the solutions discussed in this paper have
   some simplifying assumptions, such as sharp-interfaces between fluid
   phases, steady groundwater flow and homogeneous aquifer properties; the
   semi-analytical solutions presented in this study may be used
   effectively as bench mark solutions in evaluating LNAPL migration in the
   subsurface. These solutions are simple and cost effective to implement
   and may be used in the calibration of other more complex numerical
   solutions that can be found in the literature. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The effect of uncertainties in thermodynamic databases on prediction
   performances of reactive transport modeling of uranium (VI) is
   investigated with a Monte Carlo approach using the transport code TReaC.
   TReaC couples the transport model to the speciation code PHREEQC by a
   particle tracking method. A speciation example is given to illustrate
   the effect of uncertainty in thermodynamic data on the predicted
   solution composition. The transport calculations consequently show the
   prediction uncertainty resulting from uncertainty in thermodynamic data.
   A conceptually simple scenario of elution of uranium from a sand column
   is used as an illustrating example. Two different cases are
   investigated: a carbonate-enriched drinking water and an acid mine water
   associated with uranium mine remediation problems. Due to the
   uncertainty in the relative amount of positively charged and neutral
   solution species, the uncertainty in the thermodynamic data also infers
   uncertainty in the retardation behavior. The carbonated water system
   shows the largess uncertainties in speciation calculation. Therefore,
   the model predictions of total uranium solubility have a broad range.
   The effect of data uncertainty in transport prediction is further
   illustrated by a prediction of the time when eluted uranium from the
   column exceeds a threshold value. All of these Monte Carlo transport
   calculations consume large amounts of computing time. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Title = {{Biodegradation of phenols in a sandstone aquifer under aerobic
   conditions and mixed nitrate and iron reducing conditions}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia liquor with very high concentrations of phenol and alkylated
   phenols is known to have leaked into the subsurface at a former coal
   carbonization plant in the UK, giving high concentrations of ammonium in
   the groundwater. In spite of this, no significant concentrations of
   phenols were found in the groundwater. The potential for biodegradation
   of the phenols in the sandstone aquifer at the site has been
   investigated in laboratory microcosms under aerobic (oxygen amended) and
   mixed nitrate and iron reducing (nitrate enriched and unamended)
   anaerobic conditions, at a range of concentrations (low: similar to 5 mg
   1(-1): high: similar to 60 mg 1(-1), and very high: similar to 600 mg
   1(-1)) and in the presence of other organic coal-tar compounds (mono-
   and polyaromatic hydrocarbons (BTEXs and PAHs) and heterocyclic
   compounds (NSOs)) and ammonia liquor. Sandstone cores and groundwater
   for the microcosms were collected from within the anaerobic ammonium
   plume at the field site.
   Fast and complete degradation of phenol, o- and p-cresol, 2,5- and
   3,4-xylenol with no or very short initial lag-phases was observed under
   aerobic conditions at low concentrations. 2,6- and 3,5-Xylenol were
   degraded more slowly and 3,5-xylenol degradation was only just complete
   after about 1 year. The maximum rates of total phenols degradation in
   duplicate aerobic microcosms were 1.06 and 1.76 mg 1(-1) day(-1).
   The degradation of phenols in nitrate enriched and unamended anaerobic
   microcosms was similar. Fast and complete biodegradation of phenol,
   cresols, 3,4-xylenol and 3,5-xylenol was observed after short lag-phases
   in the anaerobic microcosms. 2,5-xylenol was partially degraded after a
   longer lag-phase and 2,6-xylenol persisted throughout the 3 month long
   experiments. The maximum rates of total phenols degradation in duplicate
   nitrate enriched and unamended anaerobic microcosms were 0.30-0.38 and
   0.79-0.31 mg 1(-1) day(-1), respectively. The highest phenols
   concentrations in the anaerobic microcosms apparently required very long
   adaptation periods or inhibited biodegradation of the phenols. For the
   intermediate concentration level. degradation occurred after comparable
   lag-phases and at comparable rates to those observed at low
   concentration. However, after a while degradation of phenols suddenly
   decreased drastically and then stopped. Dilution by addition of
   anaerobic groundwater resulted in continued but slow degradation of
   phenols in unamended microcosms.
   The effect of other organic coal-tar compounds (BTEXs, PAWs, NSOs) on
   the degradation of the phenols under unamended conditions was limited to
   slightly longer lag-phases fur some of the phenols. Other constituents
   of the ammonia liquor did not appear to significantly affect the
   degradation of the phenols. Fast and complete degradation of 2,3- and
   2,4-xylenol was indicated. These experiments were continued for a longer
   period of time and revealed complete degradation of 2.5-xylenol and,
   after an approximately 6-month-long lag-phase partial degradation of
   2,6-xylenol.
   The potential for natural attenuation of phenols from process effluents
   from coal carbonization under aerobic conditions and mixed nitrate and
   iron reducing conditions appears promising. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The biodegradation of phenols (similar to 5, 60, 600 mg 1(-1)) under
   anaerobic conditions (nitrate enriched and unamended) was studied in
   laboratory microcosms with sandstone material and groundwater from
   within an anaerobic ammonium plume in an aquifer, The aqueous phase was
   sampled and analyzed for phenols and selected redox sensitive parameters
   on a regular basis. An experiment with sandstone material from specific
   depth intervals from a vertical profile across the ammonium plume was
   also conducted. The miniature microcosms used in this experiment were
   sacrificed for sampling for phenols and selected redox sensitive
   parameters at the end of the experiment. The sandstone material was
   characterized with respect to oxidation and reduction potential and
   Fe(II) and Fe(III) speciation prior to use for all microcosms and at the
   end of the experiments for selected microcosms.
   The redox conditions in the anaerobic microcosms were mixed nitrate and
   Fe(III) reducing. Nitrate and Fe(III) were apparently the dominant
   electron accepters at high and low nitrate concentrations, respectively.
   When biomass growth is taken into account, nitrate and Fe(III) reduction
   constituted sufficient electron acceptor capacity for the mineralization
   of the phenols observed to be degraded even at an initial phenols
   concentration of similar to 60 mg 1(-1) (high) in an unamended
   microcosm, whereas nitrate reduction alone is unlikely to have provided
   sufficient electron acceptor capacity for the observed degradation of
   the phenols, in the unamended microcosm.
   For microcosm systems. with solid aquifer materials. dissolution of
   organic substances from the solid material may occur. A quantitative
   determination of the speciation (mineral types and quantity) of electron
   acceptors associated with the solids, at levels relevant for degradation
   of specific organic compounds in aquifers, cannot always be obtained.
   Hence, complete mass balances of electron acceptor consumption fur
   specific organic compounds degradation are difficult to confine. For
   aquifer materials with low initial Fe(II) content, Fe(II) determinations
   on solids and in aqueous phase samples may provide valuable information
   on Fe(III) reduction. However, in microcosms with natural sediments and
   where electron acceptors are associated with the sediments, complete
   mass-balances for substrates and electron accepters are not likely to be
   obtained. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of bacteriophages MS2 and PRD1, spores of Clostridium
   bifermentans (R5) and Escherichia coli (WR1) by deep well injection into
   a sandy aquifer, was studied at a pilot field site in the southeast of
   the Netherlands. Injection water was seeded with the microorganisms for
   5 days. Breakthrough was monitored for 93 days at 4 monitoring wells
   with their screens at a depth of about 310 m below surface. Within the
   first 8 m of soil passage, concentrations of MS2 and PRD1 were reduced
   by 6 log(10), that of R5 spores by 5 log(10) and that of WR1 by 7.5
   log(10). Breakthrough of MS2 and R5 could also be followed at greater
   distances from the injection well. Concentrations of MS2 were reduced
   only by about 2 log(10) in the following 30 m, and reduction of
   concentrations of R5 was negligible. Apparently, attachment was greater
   during the first 8 m of aquifer passage.
   At the point of injection, the inactivation rate coefficient of free MS2
   was found to be 0.081 day(-1), that of free PRD1 0.060 day(-1), and that
   of E. coli strain WR1 0.063 day(-1). In injection water that had passed
   8 m of soil, inactivation of MS2 phages was found to be less than in
   water from the injection well: 0.039 day(-1). Probably, the higher
   inactivation rate of MS2 in water from the injection well may be
   ascribed to the activity of aerobic bacteria. inactivation of the R5
   spores was not significant.
   From geochemical mass balances, it could be deduced that within the
   first 8 m distance from the injection well, ferric oxyhydroxides
   precipitated as a consequence of pyrite oxidation, but not at larger
   distances. Ferric oxyhydroxides provide positively charged patches onto
   which fast attachment of the negatively charged microorganisms may take
   place. The non-linear logarithmic reduction of concentrations with
   distance may therefore be ascribed to preferable attachment of
   microoganisms to patches of ferric oxyhydroxides that are present within
   8 m distance from the injection point, but not thereafter.
   Declogging of the injection well introduced hydrodynamic shear that
   remobilized MS2, which was then transported farther downstream. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{A two-region nonequilibrium model was used to calibrate initial
   solute-transport parameter estimates generated from tracer-breakthrough
   curves (TBCs) developed from tracer tests conducted in uni-axial
   solution conduits in karstic aquifers. Two-region nonequilibrium models
   account for partitioning of solute into mobile- and immobile-fluid
   regions to produce a more representative model fit to the strong tails
   associated with TBCs than do equilibrium models. The nonequilibrium
   model resulted in an increase in average flow velocities and a decrease
   in longitudinal dispersion coefficients over comparable estimates using
   an equilibrium model. Increases in velocity and decreases in dispersion
   were obtained at the expense of including parameters that describe
   solute partitioning and mass transfer rate for the mobile- and
   immobile-fluid regions. In addition, nonidentifiable sorption and mass
   transfer parameters for the immobile-fluid regions could only be
   described in terms of upper and lower bounds using readily determined
   identifiable ratios representing solute partitioning and system
   constraints based on known physical properties. The identifiable ratios
   and system constraints serve to minimize model nonuniqueness and renders
   the nonidentification problem trivial. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Realistic models of contaminant transport in groundwater demand detailed
   characterization of the spatial distribution of subsurface hydraulic
   properties, while at the same time programmatic constraints may limit
   collection of pertinent hydraulic data. Fortunately, alternate forms of
   data can be used to improve characterization of spatial variability. We
   utilize a methodology that augments sparse hydraulic information (hard
   data) with more widely available hydrogeologic information to generate
   equiprobable maps of hydrogeologic properties that incorporate patterns
   of connected permeable zones. Geophysical and lithologic logs are used
   to identify hydrogeologic categories and to condition stochastic
   simulations using Sequential Indicator Simulation (SIS). The resulting
   maps are populated with hydraulic conductivity values using field data
   and Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGS). Maps of subsurface
   hydrogeologic heterogeneity are generated for the purpose of examining
   groundwater flow and transport processes at the Faultless underground
   nuclear test, Central Nevada Test Area (CNTA), through large-scale,
   three-dimensional numerical modeling. The maps provide the basis for
   simulation of groundwater flow, while transport of radionuclides from
   the nuclear cavity is modeled using particle tracking methods.
   Sensitivity analyses focus on model parameters that are most likely to
   reduce the long travel times observed in the base case. The methods
   employed in this study have improved our understanding of the spatial
   distribution of preferential flowpaths at this site and provided the
   critical foundation on which to build models of groundwater flow and
   transport. The results emphasize that the impacts of uncertainty in
   hydraulic and chemical parameters are dependent on the radioactive decay
   of specific species, with rapid decay magnifying the effects of
   parameters that change travel time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Title = {{The Arnoldi reduction technique for efficient direct solution of

Abstract = {{An efficient technique is presented for the numerical solution of
   multi-species radionuclide decay chain transport problems in
   dual-porosity media. The method is based on the Arnoldi modal reduction
   technique that uses orthogonal matrix transformations to reduce the
   discretized transport equations. The reduced equation system is much
   smaller than the original one. This new system can be solved by a
   standard Crank-Nicolson scheme with very little computational effort and
   then the original solutions at desired time steps are obtained by using
   a matrix-vector multiplication. In this paper, we also develop two new
   alternative methods for choosing a common starting vector for all the
   transport species. The new methods can be used for most popular cases of
   first or second type boundary conditions and ensure the convergence of
   Arnoldi method. In addition, a new method for calculating mass exchange
   between the matrix block and fracture is presented. This method
   calculates the leakage terms directly using reduced space data for both
   slab and spherical matrix block and is highly efficient compared to the
   traditional iterative methods. The technique is verified through the
   comparison with analytical solutions. The efficiency and accuracy of the
   Arnoldi method are demonstrated by applying to the case study of
   three-species decay chain transport in a heterogeneous dual-porosity
   aquifer system. The proposed technique shows an impressive 98\% saving
   in computing time and 75\% saving in storage space for the case study
   problem. The Arnoldi reduction method (ARM) affords an efficient means
   of solving large problems particularly when time durations are long or
   many species are involved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Field measurements of profiles of the water content of a 7-m deep,
   sandy, phreatic aquifer have been conducted at the same site before and
   after the rainy season. The field site is an uncultivated region located
   in a citrus orchard, north of the city of Netanya, on the Coastal Plain
   aquifer of Israel. In two single-day campaigns, 13 boreholes were
   drilled in relatively homogeneous sandy sediments in an area subjected
   to infiltration of rain only. Twelve of the thirteen boreholes were
   located within a radius of 5 m. Water content, as a function of depth,
   was obtained from continuous cores. We found that the distribution of
   water within the capillary fringe (CF) was compact - denoting that there
   was an abrupt change in water content with increasing height above the
   water table. The height of the CF was about 1.4 m at each point above
   the water table, and over a horizontal distance of about 4 m, this
   height varied by up to 33\% and 50\% before and after the rainy season,
   respectively. Saturated conditions were detected in some regions of the
   CF and unsaturated conditions were found up to 1.5 m below the water
   table. The distribution of water in the capillary fringe remained
   compact while being displaced vertically as the water table rose 35 cm
   after the winter rains. These observations are consistent with pore
   level models of the water distribution within the capillary fringe in a
   porous media. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All lights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The facilitated transport of a mixture of three polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAH) (naphthalene. fluorene, and phenanthrene) by a
   rhamnolipid biosurfactant was determined with silica. octadecyl-coated
   silica, and humic acid-coated silica columns. The retardation factors
   for the contaminants in the absence of rhamnolipid ranged from 1.8
   (naphthalene with silica) to 708 (phenanthrene with octadecyl-coated
   silica). The retardation factors for phenanthrene were up to eightfold
   lower in the presence of 500 mg/l rhamnolipid compared to the situation
   where no rhamnolipid was present. The facilitated transport of the
   contaminants in the presence of rhamnolipid could be predicted by
   accounting for sorption, solubilization and admicellar sorption. In the
   octadecyl-coated matrix, transport of fluorene and phenanthrene was
   enhanced even in the presence of sub-micellar solution of rhamnolipid
   (20 mg/l), showing that adsorbed surfactant reduced the affinity of
   these compounds to this stationary phase. Linear free-energy relations
   (LFERs) indicated that the matrix-water, micelle-water, and
   admicelle-water partitioning constants for PAH were correlated with
   their l-octanol-water partitioning constants. These correlations were
   used to simulate the facilitated transport of contaminants of varying
   hydrophobicity by a surfactant. It was concluded that surfactants have
   the greatest transport facilitating effect on the mole hydrophobic
   components. The effectiveness of surfactants for enhancing removal of
   the less hydrophobic compounds(log K-ow < 3.4) may considerably be
   reduced due to admicellar sorption. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A semi-analytical solution for the simulation of one-dimensional
   subsurface solute transport incorporating multiple nonequilibrium
   processes is presented. The solution is based on the theory developed by
   Brusseau et al. (1992) {[}Brusseau, M.L., Jessup, R.E., Rao, P.S,C.,
   1992. Modeling solute transport influenced by multiprocess
   nonequilibrium and transformation reactions, Water Resources Research 28

   two-region model. In addition to developing a semi-analytical complement
   to their numerical solution, we extend the range of boundary and initial
   conditions considered, The semi-analytical solution can represent
   domains of both finite and semi-infinite extent and accommodates nonzero
   initial concentrations. The solution is derived in Laplace space and
   final results are obtained using an accurate and robust numerical
   inversion algorithm. The solution is particularly well suited for
   interpreting experimental results obtained under controlled laboratory
   conditions. Identification of the input parameters for the solution is
   examined by simulating a column experiment by van Genuchten (1974)

   S-n > 0.3. Sufficient experimental conditions were tested to suggest
   three important mechanisms affect the overall mass transfer behavior in
   this heterogeneous system. (1) Variability in the effective
   permeabilities affect the relative volume of water flowing through the
   NAPL source zone and therefore, the extent of dilution of contaminated
   water with clean water flowing around the source zone. (2) The perimeter
   surface area of the NAPL source zone affects the total interfacial area
   for mass transfer. This is an especially important contribution to the
   overall mass transfer rate during early phases of the experiment when
   there is little flow of water through this zone. (3) Within the NAPL
   source zone, decreased mass transfer rates due to limited interfacial
   area and/or increased aqueous phase flow rates becomes the overall
   rate-limiting factor in this system for S-n < 0.3. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The use of potassium permanganate to oxidize chlorinated solvents has
   been demonstrated as an effective process for treating nonaqueous phase
   liquids in ground-water systems. This study evaluates the effectiveness
   of phase-transfer catalysts (PTCs) in enhancing the degradation rate.
   PTCs work by transferring permanganate ion into the nonaqueous phase
   when it initiates oxidative decomposition. We studied the oxidation of
   trichloroethylene (TCE) by potassium permanganate, conducting kinetic
   batch experiments in conjunction with three PTCs that varied in terms of
   their extraction constants and molecular structures. Using the same
   batch technique, we examined whether PTCs could enhance the aqueous
   solubility of TCE. Solubilization could also increase oxidation rates in
   the aqueous phase. Rates of TCE oxidation in solutions containing the
   PTCs and a blank were estimated separately by measuring chloride
   concentration and W-Vis absorbance in the aqueous phase. The enhanced
   rate of TCE destruction by the PTCs was reflected by an increase in the
   rate of consumption of permanganate ion and production of chloride ion.
   There was no tendency for the PTCs, however, to solubilize TCE in the
   aqueous phase. Therefore, the PTCs increased the rate of TCE
   decomposition by catalyzing permanganate oxidation in the organic phase.
   This study suggests that there is significant potential for testing this
   scheme under field conditions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The potential for herbicide degradation in an unconfined chalk aquifer
   was examined by collecting and spiking fresh samples and incubating them
   in the laboratory. The microcosms were incubated at 20 degrees C under
   aerobic conditions and spiked with either isoproturon, atrazine or
   mecoprop at a concentration of 100 mu g/l. The samples were obtained
   from a single fieldsite within the Upper Chalk aquifer in Hampshire, UK.
   Groundwater samples required the presence of sterile chalk in a ratio of
   at least 1:13 to promote isoproturon degradation. An isoproturon
   degradation potential existed in the soil, and the chalk unsaturated and
   saturated zones. However, no degradation of isoproturon in the
   unsaturated zone was observed when a more appropriate simulation of
   in-situ moisture conditions was carried out. Apart from the soil, no
   potential for atrazine or mecoprop degradation could be detected in the
   same samples over a 200-day incubation. In a series of groundwater
   samples taken from different boreholes, 10-300 m apart, large
   differences in isoproturon degradation potential were observed. Removal
   rates for 100 mu g/l isoproturon varied from 83-425 ng/day, but in some
   samples no degradation potential could be detected. The primary
   metabolite which could be distinguished from isoproturon degradation in
   chalk and groundwater was monodesmethyl-isoproturon. When a chalk
   groundwater sample was spiked with isoproturon at 0.9 mu g/l, this was
   not degraded over a 300-day incubation period. Further experiments with
   fresh groundwater from a Triassic Sandstone site illustrated that
   groundwater bacteria could degrade isoproturon at the more realistic
   temperature of 10 degrees C as well as at 20 degrees C. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Two 15 m x 15 m field plots, a Te Awa silt loam and a Twyford fine sandy
   loam., located in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand, were applied with bromide,
   picloram, atrazine, and simazine. The Te Awa subsoil was a heterogeneous
   coarse sand and sandy gravel, and the Twyford subsoil was a more
   homogenous fine sandy loam. The underlying aquifers were composed of
   alluvial gravels at both sites with the water tables generally between
   4-5 m below ground level. The sites were monitored for 2.2-3.5 years at
   approximately monthly intervals using suction cups in the unsaturated
   zone and monitoring wells in groundwater. HYDRUS-2D was used to simulate
   water movement and solute transport in soil and groundwater in a domain
   with a depth of 10 m and length of 68 m, including a 4.5-m unsaturated
   zone. The model simulated well the general trend of field observations
   for soil water content (theta) and potential (psi(s)), and the values
   matched better for the soils with less heterogeneity. For the soils with
   significant surface cracks, the simulated theta values were
   overestimated. On the other hand, for the soil layer perching on top of
   a less permeable layer, the simulated theta values were underestimated.
   Simulated pesticide concentrations using the ``best available literature
   values{''} (BALVs) of organic carbon distribution coefficient (K-oc) and
   half-life (T-1/2) were generally lower than those observed. At early
   times in the trails, most simulations using BALVs were still within the
   same order of magnitude as observed concentrations for the shallow
   depths. However, at greater depths and later rimes, there were major
   differences between observed and simulated concentrations. The model was
   then calibrated for K-oc and T-1/2 values using observed data with an
   aid of the PEST optimisation package. Despite higher organic contents
   found in the topsoil, optimised K-oc values for pesticides were
   consistently lower for the topsoil than for the subsoil, and were also
   lower than the BALVs except for picloram, possibly as a result of
   preferential flow in the topsoil. Compared to the BALVs. picloram was
   much more persistent but slightly more sorptive in both soil types, and
   atrazine and simazine were more persistent in the Te Awa soils but less
   persistent in the Twyford soils. The optimised K-oc values for all three
   pesticides were generally greater, or close to, the BALVs in the subsoil
   of both sites.
   HYDRUS-2D provided a reasonably good link for pesticide transport in
   bath the unsaturated zone and groundwater. Simulated pesticide
   concentrations in groundwater using optimised values were generally
   similar to the observed values. Both observed and simulated bromide and
   pesticide concentrations indicated that solutes leached more quickly
   through the soils that were coarser and more heterogeneous, but were
   more diluted in the groundwater system that was more heterogeneous,
   conductive, and dispersive. Significant levels of picloram were found in
   groundwater 22 and 53 m down-gradient of the Twyford and Te Awe plot,
   respectively. Both simulated and observed atrazine and simazine
   concentrations in groundwater were less than detection limits. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Discharges of contaminated groundwater from abandoned deep mines are a
   major environmental problem in many parts of the world. While
   process-based models of pollutant generation have been successfully
   developed for certain surface mines and waste rock piles of relatively
   simple geometry and limited areal extent, such models are not readily
   applicable to large systems of laterally extensive, interconnected,
   abandoned deep mines. As a first approximation for such systems,
   hydrological and lithological factors, which can reasonably be expected
   to influence pollutant release, have been assessed by empirically
   assessing data from 81 abandoned deep coal mine discharges in the UK.
   These data demonstrate that after flooding of a deep mine is complete
   and groundwater begins to migrate from the mine voids into surface
   waters or adjoining aquifers, flushing of the mine voids by fresh
   recharge results in a gradual improvement in the quality of groundwater
   (principally manifested as decreasing Fe concentrations and
   stabilisation of pH around 7). Alternative representations of the
   flushing process have been examined. While elegant analytical solutions
   of the advection-dispersion equation can be made to mimic the changes in
   iron concentration, parameterisation is tendentious in practice.
   Scrutiny of the UK data suggest that to a first approximation, the
   duration of the main period of flushing can be predicted to endure
   around four times as long as the foregoing process of mine flooding.
   Short- and long-term iron concentrations (i.e. at the start of the main
   period of flushing and after its completion, respectively) can be
   estimated from the sulphur content of the worked strata. If strata
   composition data are unavailable, some indication of pollution potential
   can be obtained from considerations of the proximity of worked strata to
   marine beds (which typically have high pyrite contents). The long-term
   concentrations of iron in a particular discharge can also be
   approximated on the basis of the proximity of the discharge location to
   the outcrop of the most closely associated coal seam (MCACS) and. thus,
   to zones of possible ongoing pyrite oxidation. The practical application
   of these simple predictive techniques is facilitated by means of a
   flowchart. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new aquifer characterization test. the dipole-flow test
   with a tracer (DFTT), and develop its interpretation methodology.
   Combining the dipole-flow test (DFT) and a tracer test, the DFTT is a
   single-borehole, forced-gradient tracer test, The DFTT device isolates
   an injection and an extraction chamber in a well with inflatable packers
   and utilizes a small pump to create a dipole-flow pattern. After a
   steady-state flow field is reached and the pumping rate and chamber
   drawdowns are measured, a tracer is released into the injection chamber,
   and the concentration breakthrough curve is recorded in the extraction
   chamber. In developing the DFTT model, we assume that the aquifer is
   homogeneous on the scale of the test and that the well has no skin zone.
   We use a streamtube approach to semi-analytically simulate the tracer
   transport in a DFTT and determine the necessary relationships for
   estimating the longitudinal dispersivity as well as the radial and
   vertical hydraulic conductivities. The arrival time of the peak
   concentration is linearly related to the anisotropy ratio, and the
   arrival time of the tracer front is related to the longitudinal
   dispersivity. We present data from preliminary DFTTs conducted with
   Rhodamine WT (RWT) as a tracer at the Lizzie Field Site located between
   Farmville and Maury, NC. Our results demonstrate that this
   single-borehole tracer test is feasible and that its estimates of
   dispersivity are consistent with those reported in literature, whereas
   its estimates of hydraulic conductivity differ from the flowmeter-test
   estimates by less than an order of magnitude. This difference is most
   likely caused by the natural aquifer heterogeneity and different
   characterization scales of the two tests. The sorption of RWT and its
   composition of two differently sorbing isomers complicate the nature of
   the DFTT breakthrough curve and its interpretation. The use of a
   conservative tracer, such as bromide, should eliminate this
   complication. The skin effects readily manifest themselves in the DFTT
   breakthrough curve as extra and/or recirculated peaks. The presented
   interpretation methodology applies to cases with insignificant skin
   effects. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most soils contain preferential flow paths that can impact on solute
   mobility. Solutes can move rapidly down the preferential flow paths with
   high pore-water velocities, but can be held in the less permeable region
   of the soil matrix with low pore-water velocities, thereby reducing the
   efficiency of leaching. In this study, we conducted leaching experiments
   with interruption of the flow and drainage of the main flow paths to
   assess the efficiency of this type of leaching. We compared our
   experimental results to a simple analytical model, which predicts the
   influence of the variations in concentration gradients within a single
   spherical aggregate (SSA) surrounded by preferential flow paths on
   leaching. We used large (length: 300 mm, diameter: 216 mm) undisturbed
   field soil cores from two contrasting soil types. To carry out
   intermittent leaching experiments, the field soil cores were first
   saturated with tracer solution (CaBr2), and background solution (CaCl2)
   was applied to mimic a leaching event. The cores were then drained at
   25- to 30-cm suction to empty the main flow paths to mimic a dry period
   during which solutes could redistribute within the undrained region. We
   also conducted continuous leaching experiments to assess the impact of
   the dry periods on the efficiency of leaching. The flow interruptions
   with drainage enhanced leaching by 10-20\% for our soils, which was
   consistent with the model's prediction, given an optimised ``equivalent
   aggregate radius{''} for each soil. This parameter quantifies the time
   scales that characterise diffusion within the undrained region of the
   soil, and allows us to calculate the duration of the leaching events and
   interruption periods that would lead to more efficient leaching.

Abstract = {{Recent discovery of bomb-related Cl-36 at depth in fractured tuff in the
   unsaturated zone at the Yucca Mountain candidate high-level waste (HLW)
   repository site has called into question the usual modeling assumptions
   based on the equivalent continuum model (ECM). A dual continuum model
   (DCM) for simulating transient flow and transport at Yucca Mountain is
   developed. In order to ensure properly converged flow solutions, which
   an used in the transport simulation, a new flow solution convergence
   criteria is derived. An extensive series of simulation studies is
   presented which indicates that rapid movement of solute through the
   fractures will not occur unless there are intense episodic infiltration
   events. Movement of solute in the environs of the repository is enhanced
   if the properties of the tuff layer at the repository horizon are
   modified from current best-estimate values. Due to a large
   advective-dispersive coupling between the matrix and fractures, the
   matrix acts as a major buffer which inhibits rapid transport along the
   fractures. Consequently, fast movement of solutes through the fractures
   to the repository depth can only be explained if the matrix-fracture
   coupling term is significantly reduced from a value that would be
   calculated on the basis of data currently available. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The efficiency and effectiveness of soil vapor extraction (SVE) and
   bioventing (BV) systems for remediation of unsaturated zone soils is
   controlled by a complex combination of physical, chemical and biological
   factors. The Michigan soil vapor extraction remediation (MISER) model, a
   two-dimensional numerical simulator, is developed to advance our ability
   to investigate the performance of field scale SVE and BV systems by
   integrating processes of multiphase flow, multicomponent compositional
   transport with nonequilibrium interphase mass transfer, and aerobic
   biodegradation. Subsequent to the model presentation, example
   simulations of single well SVE and BV systems are used to illustrate the
   interplay between physical, chemical and biological processes and their
   potential influence on remediation efficiency and the pathways of
   contaminant removal. Simulations of SVE reveal that removal efficiency
   is controlled primarily by the ability to engineer gas flow through
   regions of organic liquid contaminated soil and by interphase mass
   transfer limitations. Biodegradation is found to play a minor role in
   mass removal for the examined SVE scenarios. Simulations of BV systems
   suggest that the effective supply of oxygen may not be the sole
   criterion for efficient BV performance. The efficiency and contaminant
   removal pathways in these systems can be significantly influenced by
   interdependent dynamics involving biological growth factors, interphase
   mass transfer rates, and air injection rates. Simulation results
   emphasize the need for the continued refinement and validation of
   predictive interphase mass transfer models applicable under a variety of
   conditions and for the continued elucidation and quantification of
   microbial processes under unsaturated field conditions. Published by

Abstract = {{An optimization methodology for designing groundwater quality monitoring
   networks applicable to stochastic flow fields is presented and
   evaluated. The approach sets itself apart from previous techniques by
   incorporating the time dimension directly into the objective function.
   This function is extremized using a directed partial enumeration
   strategy guided by physical considerations related to transport
   processes. The result is a set of monitoring well locations and a
   sampling schedule that minimizes plume characterization error while
   satisfying constraints on the maximum number of wells and allowable
   number of active wells. The method is evaluated using hypothetical
   plumes with varying degrees of heterogeneity. Results indicate that the
   proposed approach is successful in generating near-optimal sampling
   networks that satisfy all imposed constraints. Monitoring networks with
   as little as three active wells and a total of 12 wells are found to
   provide adequate plume characterization for low toxicity contaminants.

Abstract = {{A research tool for modeling the reactive flow and transport of
   groundwater contaminants in multiple dimensions is presented,
   Arbitrarily complex coupled kinetic-equilibrium heterogeneous reaction
   networks, automatic code generation, transfer-function based solutions,
   parameter estimation, high-resolution methods for advection, and robust
   solvers for the mixed kinetic-equilibrium chemistry are some of the
   features of reactive flow and transport (RAFT) that make it a versatile
   research tool in the modeling of a wide variety of laboratory and field
   experiments. The treatment of reactions is quite general so that RAFT
   can be used to model biological, adsorption/desorption, complexation,
   and mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions among others. The
   integrated framework involving automated code generation and parameter
   estimation allows for the development, characterization, and evaluation
   of mechanistic process models, The model is described and used to solve
   a problem in competitive adsorption that illustrates some of these
   features. The model is also used to study the development of an in situ
   Fe(II)-zone by encouraging the growth of an iron-reducing bacterium with
   lactate as the electron donor. Such redox barriers are effective in
   sequestering groundwater contaminants such as chromate and TCE.

Abstract = {{The attenuation of inorganic contaminants in acetogenic and methanogenic
   landfill leachate by calcareous and carbonate-deficient, oxide-rich
   Triassic sandstone aquifer materials from the English Midlands was
   examined in laboratory columns. Aqueous equilibrium speciation
   modelling, simple transport modelling and chemical mass balance
   approaches are used to evaluate the key processes and aquifer
   geochemical properties controlling contaminant fate. The results
   indicate that leachate-rock interactions are dominated by ion-exchange
   processes, acid-base and redox reactions and sorption/precipitation of
   metal species. Leachate NH4 is attenuated by cation exchange with the
   aquifer sediments; however, NH4 migration could be described with a
   simple model using retardation factors. Organic acids in the acetogenic
   leachate buffered the system pH at low levels during flushing of the
   calcareous aquifer material. In contrast, equilibrium with Al
   oxyhydroxide phases initially buffered pH (similar to 4.5) during
   flushing of the carbonate-deficient sandstone with methanogenic
   leachate. This led to the mobilisation of sorbed and oxide-bound heavy
   metals from the aquifer sediment which migrated as a concentrated pulse
   at the leachate front. Abiotic reductive dissolution of Mn oxyhydroxides
   on each aquifer material by leachate Fe2+ maintains high concentrations
   of dissolved Mn and buffers the leachate inorganic redox system. This
   feature is analogous to the Mn-reducing zones found in leachate plumes
   and in the experiments provides a sink for the leachate Fe load and
   other heavy metals. The availability of reactive solid phase Mn
   oxyhydroxides limits the duration of redox buffering and Fe attenuation
   by these aquifer sediments. Aquifer pH and redox buffering capacity
   exert a fundamental influence on leachate inorganic contaminant fate in
   these systems. The implications for the assessment of aquifer
   vulnerability at landfills are discussed and simple measurements of
   aquifer properties which may improve the prediction of contaminant
   attenuation are outlined. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The sorption and degradation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and 13
   organic micropollutants (BTEX, aromatic hydrocarbons, chloro-aromatic
   and -aliphatic compounds, and pesticides) in acetogenic and methanogenic
   landfill leachate was studied in laboratory columns containing Triassic
   sandstone aquifer materials from the English Midlands. Solute sorption
   and degradation relationships were evaluated using a simple transport
   model. Relative to predictions, micropollutant sorption was decreased up
   to eightfold in acetogenic leachate, but increased up to sixfold in
   methanogenic leachate. This behaviour reflects a combination of
   interactions between the micropollutants, leachate DOM and aquifer
   mineral fraction. Sorption of DOM was not significant. Degradation of
   organic fractions occurred under Mn-reducing and SO4-reducing
   conditions. Degradation of some micropollutants occurred exclusively
   under Mn-reducing conditions. DOM and benzene were not significantly
   degraded under the conditions and time span (up to 280 days) of the
   experiments. Most micropollutants were degraded immediately or after a
   lag phase (32-115 days). Micropollutant degradation rates varied
   considerably (half-lives of 8 to > 2000 days) for the same compounds
   (e.g., TeCE) in different experiments, and for compounds (e.g.,
   naphthalene, DCB and TeCA) within the same experiment. Degradation of
   many micropollutants was both simultaneous and sequential, and inhibited
   by the utilisation of different substrates. This mechanism, in
   combination with lag phases, controls micropollutant degradation
   potential in these systems more than the degradation rate. These aquifer
   materials have a potentially large capacity for in situ bioremediation
   of organic pollutants in landfill leachate and significant degradation
   may occur in the Mn-reducing zones of leachate plumes. However,
   degradation of organic pollutants in acetogenic leachate may be limited
   in aquifers with low pH buffering capacity and reducible Mn oxides.
   Contaminants in this leachate present a greater risk to groundwater
   resources in these aquifers than methanogenic leachate. (C) 2000

   unsaturated chalk cores through which a pulse of isoproturon and bromide
   was eluted. The cores were set-up to simulate conditions in the
   unsaturated zone of the UK Chalk aquifer by applying a suction of 1 kPa
   (0.1 m H2O) to the base of each column, and eluting at a rate
   corresponding to an average recharge rate through the unsaturated Chalk.
   A dye tracer indicated that the flow was through the matrix under these
   conditions. The results from the first column study showed high recovery
   rates for both isoproturon (73-92\%) and bromide (93-96\%), and that
   isoproturon was retarded by a factor of about 1.23 relative to bromide.
   In the second column study, two of the four columns were eluted with
   non-sterile groundwater in place of the sterile groundwater used on all
   other columns, and this study showed high recovery rates for bromide
   (85-92\%) and lower recovery rates for isoproturon (66-79\% - sterile
   groundwater, 48-61\% - non-sterile groundwater). The enhanced
   degradation in the columns eluted with non-sterile groundwater indicated
   that groundwater microorganisms had increased the degradation rate
   within these columns. Overall, the reduced isoproturon recovery in the
   second column study was attributed to increased microbial degradation as
   a result of the longer study duration (162 vs. 105 days). The
   breakthrough curves (BTCs) for bromide had a characteristic
   convection-dispersion shape and were accurately simulated with the
   minimum of calibration using a simple convection-dispersion model
   (LEACHP). However, the isoproturon BTCs had an unusual shape and could
   not be accurately simulated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research was to determine the role that unsaturated
   flow conditions play in virus sorption and inactivation during transport
   through sand columns. Column flow experiments were conducted in Ottawa
   sand under both saturated and unsaturated flow conditions using two
   bacteriophages, MS2 and phi X174. Input solution containing bromide
   (Br-) tracer and the viruses was applied to the column as a step
   function and samples were collected at the effluent end using a fraction
   collector. The convection-dispersion equation, partially calibrated with
   the transport parameters measured from the Br- signal, was used to
   evaluate the sorption and inactivation characteristics of the viruses.
   We found that, while removal of both MS2 and phi X174 increased
   significantly under unsaturated flow conditions, the mechanisms
   responsible for removing the two viruses seemed to be different. The
   results from elution experiments using beef extract solution revealed
   that the increased removal of phi X174 in the Ottawa sand under
   unsaturated conditions appeared to be caused by increased sorption
   whereas the increased removal of MS2 was due to inactivation. The
   difference in virus removal and transport behavior between saturated and
   unsaturated conditions was likely caused by additional sorption at the
   solid surfaces and the presence of the air-water interface (AWI) in the
   unsaturated system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The air-water interfacial area (a(0)) was estimated using the surfactant
   adsorption concept in unsaturated porous media. A column composed of
   several stainless steel rings was used to carry out
   saturated/unsaturated experiments in three glass beads media (0.25, 0.50
   and 0.75 mm) using sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (SDBS) and NaCl as
   the reactive and nonreactive tracers, respectively. SDBS sorption onto
   the glass bead surfaces was determined by miscible displacement and was
   found to be zero. The medium was made unsaturated step by step with
   recycled surfactant solution from saturated conditions to achieve
   homogeneous surfactant concentration in the liquid phase. This also
   helped to form a stable air-water interface and pressure-saturation
   relationship inside the soil column. After establishing equilibrium in
   the system, the rings were dismantled and total surfactant mass from
   each ring was extracted and analyzed by the two-phase Hyamine 1622
   titration method. The number of surfactant monomers adsorbed onto the
   air-water interface per unit area was determined by Gibbs isotherm. The
   air-water interfacial area was then estimated based on the amount of
   SDBS onto the air-water interface divided by the number of SDBS monomers
   per unit area. The results obtained by this technique for different
   porous media revealed that the estimated a(0) followed the general
   concept of a decreasing trend with increasing S-w and grain size.
   Surface areas of the solid, obtained by extrapolating the curves from
   the experimental data (a(0) similar to S-w) at S-w = 0, were also found
   closer to the areas calculated by the geometrical method. (C) 2000

   have been examined in the fight of the results of a groundwater sulphate
   sulphur isotope investigation. This has allowed the distinction of
   different sources of sulphate and their relative importance in different
   parts of the aquifer. The principal sources are S-34-depleted inputs,
   derived from the oxidation of pyrite within both the aquifer matrix
   material and the overlying mudstone deposits, and S-34-enriched
   anthropogenic inputs which are derived from acid rain fallout augmented
   by agrochemicals.
   Groundwaters sampled over the outcrop zone of the aquifer have sulphate
   delta(34)S dominated by contemporary acid rain inputs in the recharge
   waters. A down-dip decrease in the S-34 content of groundwater sulphate
   over the unconfined and shallow confined areas of the aquifer is
   indicative of a progressive increase in the significance of
   pyrite-derived sulphate in the system. The contribution of sulphate from
   this source is large and indicates that pollution front penetration
   (previously based on total sulphate concentrations) is more restricted
   than previously thought. Moreover, the extent of pyrite oxidation is
   greater than can be accounted for by dissolved O-2 and the additional
   component corresponds to that which would be expected from reduction of
   nitrate using pyrite as the electron donor. We suggest that this
   mechanism is responsible for denitrification in the aquifer, but that it
   will be ultimately limited by pyrite availability near fissure surfaces
   where the reaction takes place. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Leaching rates of heavy metals (zinc and copper) and nitrogen were
   measured in 500-mm deep monolith lysimeters containing a heavy clay
   soil. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of
   preferential flow on leaching of these chemicals under different
   precipitation regimes. N was applied at a rate of 100 kg ha(-1) (50 kg
   NO3-N ha(-1) and 50 kg NH4-N ha(-1)), Zn, at a rate of 100 kg ha(-1),
   and Cu, at 40 kg ha(-1). Simultaneously, Br was applied at a rate of 100
   kg ha(-1) to provide information on water movement through the profiles.
   A modified version of the `tanks-in-series model' was used to describe
   the distribution function of non-reactive tracer (Br) travel time and
   compare the results with experimental data obtained in the lysimeters.
   Rapid discharge of Br in the monoliths was taken as a clear evidence for
   preferential flow. This flow behaviour was well described by the model
   through the parameters n and f(m), that is, in terms of the degree of
   mixing of water in soil and the ratio between mobile regions and the
   maximum amount of water in a monolith when freely drained. When
   determining parameter values, the required experimental period was made
   shorter by using a peak coordinate of distribution of non-reactive
   tracer travel time, instead of the moment analysis. The model could use
   the cumulative leachate as the only variable in the distribution
   function of tracer travel time under non-steady flow conditions. N
   leaching occurred in the form of NO3-N, which was also largely displaced
   through preferential flow. Zn leaching was also enhanced by preferential
   flow, whereas Cu leaching was negligible. Concentrations of NO3-N and Zn
   in leachate in the treatments, which received the element, often
   exceeded the Swedish drinking water guideline. The results obtained in
   this study show that preferential flow may have a substantial influence
   on leaching of heavy metals and nitrogen, and the combination of
   monolith lysimeters and the modified tanks-in-series model may be used
   to classify soils in terms of the occurrence of such flow behaviour. (C)

Abstract = {{A survey of rural groundwater quality in Canada showed that some
   drinking water wells were consistently contaminated with bacteria,
   whereas others were consistently free of such contamination. The purpose
   of this study was to identify profile characteristics that make wells
   susceptible to, or provide natural protection against microbial
   contamination. Information from surveys was supplemented with
   information from regional maps of soil, physiography, quaternary and
   bedrock geology, together with descriptions of stratigraphy from the
   well driller's records. The prediction of the most relevant factors
   affecting well water quality in Ontario was evaluated for the different
   soil and geological profiles in the Goromonzi district of Zimbabwe. High
   risk wells in Ontario were located most often at sites with older
   limestone or dolostone bedrock, and in clay or clay loam soil. The
   presence of a sandy soil may offer some protection to groundwater
   resources in very vulnerable dug or bored wells. The presence of shale
   and hardpan layers may offer protection due to the impermeable nature of
   these deposits. Well construction was a dominant factor affecting water
   quality. Shallow dug or bored wells, located in sites where there is a
   thin soil profile or shallow water table, can be very vulnerable to
   contamination. Dug or bond wells were most affected by the soil and
   geological setting of the well location. Manure spreading, particularly
   daily manure application, increased the risk of well water
   contamination, whereas other farming practices such as tillage were less
   predictive of well vulnerability. Knowledge of the history of
   contamination for a well was useful in predicting well susceptibility, A
   brief assessment of topography and local surface water provided
   sufficient information to indicate the direction of groundwater now, the
   most important feature that can be used to predict the susceptibility of
   a well in a given location. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

   evenly positioned throughout the model aquifer. The electrical
   conductivity of the K+-spiked water was continuously monitored using
   electrodes placed near the 32 sampling points, Laboratory results were

   groundwater bodies; the upper that was captured by the stripping well,
   and the lower unaffected by the remediation system. Thereby, the primary
   factors of efficiency of this remediation technique were evaluated. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of sorption on degradation of the pesticide 2,
   4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) was studied in a soil amended with
   various amounts of activated carbon (AC). The relationship between
   sorption and decay of 2,4-D was analyzed using analytical solutions for
   equilibrium sorption and to a two-site nonequilibrium adsorption model
   coupled with two first-order degradation terms for the dissolved and
   sorbed pesticide, respectively. The sorption parameters in the latter
   model were determined based on data obtained from batch sorption
   experiments, while those for degradation were obtained from incubation
   experiments. The adsorption coefficients, ranging from 0.811 to > 315 ml
   g(-1), increased at higher AC, and were negatively related to
   degradation as measured by the first-order rate constant, implying that
   degradation is faster from the liquid phase than from the sorbed phase.
   A nonlinear fit of the decay curves to the nonequilibrium model revealed
   that degradation rate constants were 0.157 and 0.00243 day(-1) for the
   liquid and sorbed phases, respectively, differing by a factor of 65.
   Similar results were also obtained using the equilibrium model. A
   parameter sensitivity analysis of the nonequilibrium model indicates
   that nonequilibrium sorption will initially favor degradation; however,
   over the long term, will decrease degradation when desorption kinetics
   becomes the limiting factor in the degradation process. In the presence
   of a lag phase that allows appreciable amounts of chemical to diffuse
   into kinetic sorption sites, nonequilibrium sorption will only impede
   degradation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present an experimental approach for investigating the potential for
   bioremediation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in fractured rock
   vadose zones. The experimental work was performed with rock Samples and
   indigenous microocganisms from the site of the United States Department
   of Energy's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory
   (INEEL), located in a basalt flow basin where VOC contamination
   threatens the Snake River Aquifer. Our approach has four components: (1)
   establishing a conceptual model for fluid and contaminant distribution
   in the geologic matrix of interest; (2) identification of important
   features of liquid distribution by means of seepage experiments in the
   fracture plane; (3) identification of the presence and activity of
   microorganisms by non-destructive monitoring of biotransformations on
   rock surfaces at the micron-scale; and (4) integration of flow and
   biological activity in natural rock ``geocosms{''}. Geocosms are
   core-scale flow cells that incorporate some aspects of natural
   conditions, such as liquid seepage in the fracture plane and moisture
   content. Fluid flow and distribution within fracture networks may be a
   significant factor in the ability of microorganisms to degrade VOCs, as
   they affect the availability of substrate, moisture and nutrients. Flow
   visualization and tracer breakthrough curves in transparent fracture
   replicas for unsaturated inlet conditions exhibited the channelized and
   intermittent nature of liquid seepage, The seepage of water and
   non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) of varying physical and chemical
   properties into an initially dry replica showed only subtle differences
   in liquid distribution. In contrast, the seepage of a NAPL into the
   fracture replica containing residual water resulted in complex trapping
   of NAPL alone the solid/water/air contact lines and diversion of NAPL to
   previously dry parts of the fracture. We found that a mixed culture of
   viable bacteria exists on the natural ruck surfaces. Microbial activity
   measurably changed in response to changing relative humidity (RH).
   Biological activity in the geocosm produced changes in liquid surface
   tension and seepage patterns over time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The uptake of 5 X 10(-4) mol/l solutions of Cd, Pb and Zn by a fluvio
   glacial deposit with high carbonate content (227 mg/g) was studied in
   column and batch experiments. The heavy metals were added to soil
   samples and the retention examined using a speciation scheme with five
   fractions: exchangeable, acid-soluble, reducible, oxidizable and
   residual. In batch experiments, the three metal ions were completely
   bound by the soil, mostly to the acid-soluble fraction: 62\% for Cd,
   96\% Pb and 86\% Zn. The exchangeable fraction was of minor importance,
   with 27\% Cd, 4\% Pb and 11\% Zn. The thermodynamic data suggested that
   lead and cadmium were mainly associated with carbonate ions while the
   zinc was found in two forms, zinc hydroxide and zinc carbonate. The
   influence of initial metal concentration was examined for Cd; an
   increase in metal concentration led weaker retention. The column
   experiments showed progressive saturation of the soil, with lead being
   retained better than cadmium or zinc. The measured retentions of all
   three metals were lower for columns than in batches. This difference was
   not explainable by thermodynamic data or by reaction kinetics alone. We
   believe it is mainly due to preferential flows in column experiments,
   favouring metal ion elution. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A multi-dimensional and multi-species reactive transport model was
   developed to aid in the analysis of natural attenuation design at
   chlorinated solvent sites. The model can simulate several simultaneously
   occurring attenuation processes including aerobic and anaerobic
   biological degradation processes. The developed model was applied to
   analyze field-scale transport and biodegradation processes occurring at
   the Area-6 site in Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The model was
   calibrated to field data collected at this site. The calibrated model
   reproduced the general groundwater flow patterns, and also, it
   successfully recreated the observed distribution of tetrachloroethene
   (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), dichloroethylene (DCE), vinyl chloride
   (VC) and chloride plumes. Field-scale decay rates of these contaminant
   plumes were also estimated. The decay rates are within the range of
   values that were previously estimated based on lab-scale microcosm and
   field-scale transect analyses. Model simulation results indicated that
   the anaerobic degradation rate of TCE, source loading rate, and
   groundwater transport rate are the important model parameters.
   Sensitivity analysis of the model indicated that the shape and extent of
   the predicted TCE plume is most sensitive to transmissivity values. The
   total mass of the predicted TCE plume is most sensitive to TCE anaerobic
   degradation rates. The numerical model developed in this study is a
   useful engineering tool for integrating field-scale natural attenuation
   data within a rational modeling framework. The model results can be used
   for quantifying the relative importance of various simultaneously
   occurring natural attenuation processes. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A three-site cation exchange model is proposed to describe the
   concentration dependent uptake of Cs on natural argillaceous rock
   systems. Major premises in the model are that the sorption of Cs is
   dominated by the illite mineral component in the rock and that there is
   a fixed relationship between the site capacities of the three site types
   denoted as frayed edge, type II and planar sites. The definition of a
   ``reference illite{''} with a cation exchange capacity of 0.2 equiv. kg
   (-1) allows the three site capacities to be fixed in the model
   calculations over the weight fraction of illite in the argillaceous
   rocks. Up to Cs equilibrium concentrations of similar to 10 (-3) M
   sorption occurs predominantly on the frayed edge and type II sites
   (higher affinity sites), with the planar site type playing only a minor
   role. Competition with Cs for sorption on the former two site types
   arises predominantly from monovalent cations such as K, Rb and NH (4)
   which have low hydration energies. H and Na (except at high
   concentrations) are considerably less competitive and bivalent cations
   such as Mg, Ca and Sr are effectively non-competitive. A consistent set
   of selectivity coefficients for Cs with respect to K, Rb, NH (4) and Na
   was derived from analyses and modelling of a wide range of Cs sorption
   data available in the open literature on pure illites from many
   different sources. The model was tested against four Cs sorption
   isotherm data sets determined on argillaceous rocks: Boom clay, Oxford
   clay, Palfris marl and Opalinus clay. The water chemistries and illite
   contents given in these experiments allowed the Cs sorption isotherms to
   be predicted. It is concluded that the Cs sorption model presented here,
   in which there are no free parameters, can be used to predict the uptake
   of Cs at equilibrium concentrations below similar to 10 (-3) M to within
   a factor of 2 to 3 in natural argillaceous rock systems. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The sorption stability of EDTA complexes of some lanthanides (Tb (3 +),
   Tm (3 +) and Yb (3 +)) in a saline groundwater environment has been
   investigated in laboratory and in situ experiments. It is shown that the
   YbEDTA (-) complex possesses a lower sorption rate than TbEDTA (-).
   Based on analysis of laboratory results and literature describing
   kinetic studies of complex exchange reactions, a conceptual
   decomplexation/sorption model for EDTA complexed lanthanides is
   proposed. The model consists of exchange reactions with di-valent ions,
   Fe (2 +), Mn (2 +) and Ca (2 +), which are both present in the
   groundwater and associated to the solid matrix, followed by an, within
   the time frame of the experiments, irreversible sorption of the
   non-complexed lanthanide ion. Calculations using the conceptual model
   has been performed both for the laboratory experiment results and the in
   situ experiment results. For the in situ experiment, a computer program
   was constructed that simulates transport in a one-dimensional flow with
   hydrodynamic dispersion and kinetic hindered exchange reactions of the
   lanthanide EDTA complexes with Ca (2 +) Good agreement was obtained
   between the calculated breakthrough curves and those obtained in the in
   situ experiment, supporting the applicability of the proposed model and
   the kinetical data obtained in laboratory experiments. However, for the
   long time perspective, there is an indication of an increased mobility
   of the lanthanide EDTA complexes, which deviates from the results of the
   model calculations. A conclusion is that kinetic characteristics of the
   lanthanide EDTA complexes can be applied for the prediction of the
   transport behaviour, at least in the short-term perspective. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations are used for the systematic exploration of the
   migration and entrapment of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) in
   heterogeneous formations. Ensembles of realizations of random, spatially
   correlated permeability fields are generated and employed in model
   simulations of a spill event. Statistical techniques are then used to
   quantify the sensitivity of model predictions to input parameters,
   thereby identifying the parameters or processes that may be of primary
   importance in the determination of organic liquid distributions in
   heterogeneous systems. Results of the study indicate that the most
   critical factors in modeling organic entrapment include the spill
   release rate, reliable estimates of the mean, variance, and vertical
   correlation scale of the formation permeability, and an accurate
   representation of the correlation between the capillary
   pressure-saturation function and the permeability. In contrast, the
   hydraulic gradient and cross-correlation of residual saturations with
   permeabilities are found to have only minor influence on organic liquid
   distributions in such heterogeneous formations. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation techniques are used to explore the
   surfactant-enhanced solubilization of a spill of tetrachloroethylene
   (PCE) entrapped in a heterogeneous, saturated sandy aquifer. A
   two-dimensional, multicomponent solubilization simulator is employed to
   simulate spill cleanup, utilizing ensembles of realizations of random,
   spatially correlated permeability fields. Flushing volumes required to
   remove the organic liquid and to reduce effluent concentrations to
   specified levels are used as measures of remediation effectiveness.
   Simulations illustrate the long-term persistence of nonaqueous phase
   liquid (NAPL) in low permeability regions and associated tailing of
   effluent organic concentrations. The tendency of the high concentration
   organic plumes to migrate downward under gravity forces is also
   demonstrated, and is shown to enhance migration of aqueous phase organic
   into regions of low permeability, causing substantially increased
   concentration tailing. Remediation efficiency is shown to be strongly
   dependent on spatial correlation structure and variance of the
   permeability distribution. Delivery of surfactant to low permeability
   regions is primarily controlled by transverse mixing processes. The
   influence of local mass transfer limitations on cleanup efficiency,
   although statistically significant, is found to be relatively minor for
   the contamination scenarios explored. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A pilot landfill (area, 16 m(2); depth 1.5 m) containing
   cement-stabilized air pollution control (APC) residues from municipal
   solid waste incinerators (MSWI) was investigated in order to determine
   the hydrological and geochemical factors that control the leaching
   process. Between May and August 1996, 3 rain events were investigated.
   Rainfall and discharge were monitored and leachate samples taken for the
   analysis of major components. It was found that water from the rain
   events took 2-3 days to pass through the lysimeter. Leachate dilution at
   the beginning of rain events indicated that rainwater passed through the
   lysimeter as preferential flow. The change in the concentration of
   leachate components with time was found to be almost identical for most
   components. Conductivity, dominated by Na (+) and OH (-), also
   positively correlated with the concentrations of Al, Cs, K, Si, sulfate,
   chloride, carbonate and organic substances in the drainage discharge.
   The Ca concentrations were not influenced by the rain events, indicating
   that this component was leached by rainwater from the lysimeter cover
   layer. This was also found to apply to observed changes in Sr
   concentrations. Both conductivity and Sr were used as tracers for
   rainwater in the leachate and results agreed well. The solubility of the
   main constituents, Ca, Si, and Al could be explained by thermodynamic
   equilibrium with the solids calcium silicate hydrate, ettringite and
   possibly K-feldspar. The results indicate that the leaching process
   (within the first 5 years) is dominated by pare waters between the
   cement blocks that me in equilibrium with the cement-stabilized APC
   residues (thus explaining the constant composition of the leachate) and
   is flushed out by rain events. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{High-resolution X-ray absorption imaging was used to investigate the
   effects of spatially heterogeneous porosity on matrix diffusion.
   Experiments were performed on four, centimeter-scale slabs of Culebra
   dolomite taken from the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) site. These
   tests involved the diffusion of potassium iodide into a single edge of
   each brine-saturated rock slab, while X-ray absorption imaging was used
   to measure the two-dimensional relative concentration distribution at
   different times during the experiment. X-ray imaging was also used to
   measure the heterogeneous, two-dimensional porosity distribution of each
   rock slab. The resulting high-resolution data provide unique insight
   into the spatially varying diffusion characteristics of each
   heterogeneous rock sample, which traditional methods such as
   through-diffusion experiments cannot. In these tests, significant
   variations in the diffusion coefficient were calculated over the
   relatively small length (centimeter) and time scales (months)
   investigated. Results also indicated that these variations were related
   to the heterogeneous porosity characteristics of each rock sample. Not
   only were the diffusion coefficients found to depend on the magnitude of
   the porosity but also on its spatial distribution. Specifically, the
   geometry, position, and orientation of the heterogeneous porosity
   features populating each rock slab appeared to influence the diffusion
   characteristics. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering projects involving hydrogeology are faced with uncertainties
   because the earth is heterogeneous, and typical data sets are fragmented
   and disparate. In theory, predictions provided by computer simulations
   using calibrated models constrained by geological boundaries provide
   answers to support management decisions, and geostatistical methods
   quantify safety margins. In practice, current methods are limited by the
   data types and models that can be included, computational demands, or
   simplifying assumptions. Data Fusion Modeling (DFM) removes many of the
   limitations and is capable of providing data integration and model
   calibration with quantified uncertainty for a variety of hydrological,
   geological, and geophysical data types and models. The benefits of DFM
   for waste management, water supply, and geotechnical applications are
   savings in time and cost through the ability to produce visual models
   that fill in missing data and predictive numerical models to aid
   management optimization. DFM has the ability to update field-scale
   models in real time using PC or workstation systems and is ideally
   suited for parallel processing implementation. DFM is a spatial state
   estimation and system identification methodology that uses three sources
   of information: measured data, physical laws, and statistical models for
   uncertainty in spatial heterogeneities. What is new in DFM is the
   solution of the causality problem in the data assimilation Kalman filter
   methods to achieve computational practicality. The Kalman filter is
   generalized by introducing information filter methods due to Bierman
   coupled with a Markov random field representation for spatial variation.
   A Bayesian penalty function is implemented with Gauss-Newton methods.
   This leads to a computational problem similar to numerical simulation of
   the partial differential equations (PDEs) of groundwater. In fact,
   extensions of PDE solver ideas to break down computations over space
   form the computational heart of DFM. State estimates and uncertainties
   can be computed for heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields in
   multiple geological layers from the usually sparse hydraulic
   conductivity data and the often more plentiful head data. Further, a
   system identification theory has been derived based on statistical
   likelihood principles. A maximum likelihood theory is provided to
   estimate statistical parameters such as Markov model parameters that
   determine the geostatistical variogram. Field-scale application of DFM
   at the DOE Savannah River Site is presented and compared with manual
   calibration. DFM calibration runs converge in less than 1 h on a Pentium
   Pro PC for a 3D model with more than 15,000 nodes. Run time is
   approximately linear with the number of nodes. Furthermore, conditional
   simulation is used to quantify the statistical variability in model
   predictions such as contaminant breakthrough curves. Published by

Abstract = {{This study investigates patterns of Anger development and propagation in
   layered porous media. Fingers are created with interfacial
   perturbations, formed by adding a thin zone of regularly varying
   hydraulic conductivity along the layer. Simulation results agree
   qualitatively with those observed in two-dimensional laboratory
   experiments. In all cases, the formation of instabilities requires
   seeding of perturbations, even if the system is unstably stratified. A
   series of simulations show how the shapes of the instabilities differ
   according to where along the unstable interface the instabilities form
   and the layer in which they develop. Pathline analyses indicate how the
   patterns of flow in the domain can be exceedingly complex. Concentration
   distributions are influenced by movements of water between layers and
   the formation of a large convection cell in the lowermost layer. These
   numerical investigations reinforce inferences from the experimental
   studies that classical stability theory is less useful in determining
   whether instabilities will form and what their shape will be. Even with
   the relatively simple layering, patterns of flow and resulting
   concentrations are complex. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The application of a DC electric field down gradient to the contaminated
   zone in the subsurface can create an electrokinetic barrier. The
   electrical potential gradient causes the movement of ions which in turn
   imposes a viscous drag on the pore water. In clayey soils, this viscous
   drag can generate a high enough pore water pressure capable of
   counteracting the ground water gradient. This phenomenon can be used
   effectively as a barrier to prevent contaminant migration. A finite
   element model was developed to simulate the contaminant migration in
   soil under coupled hydraulic, electrical and chemical gradients. The
   model is also capable of predicting the associated changes in the soil
   like the pore water pressure, pH and voltage gradient as a function of
   time and distance from the electrode. This model was validated using the
   experimental data presented by Yeung {[}Yeung, A.T., 1990.
   Electro-kinetic barrier to contaminant transport through compacted clay.
   PhD Thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 260 pp.]. The results
   indicate Very good agreement between the experimental and simulated
   results. The model predications show that when the anode is placed down
   gradient of the cathode, the cation migration could be completely
   arrested. However, the anions were found to move faster in the direction
   of the ground water flow and reduce the effectiveness of the barrier.
   This could be avoided by carefully designing the placement of the
   electrodes. If the contaminant of interest is either a cation or an
   anion, a simple double row of anode and cathode electrode arrangement
   could serve as an effective barrier. On the other hand, if the
   contaminant includes both anions and cations, then a triple-row
   configuration of electrodes need to be implemented. The model
   simulations could be used to assess different electrode configurations
   and current application strategies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{A common criticism of many soil lysimeter designs has been the existence
   of artificial flowpaths along the soil-wall interface. This artificial
   flow is referred to as sidewall flow. A simple lysimeter-design
   modification was evaluated that utilizes annular rings to divert
   sidewall flow near the soil surface into the soil column to minimize the
   occurrence of sidewall flow along the remainder of the column's length.
   A chloride-tracer experiment was used to evaluate the effectiveness of
   annular rings in minimizing sidewall flow in a mesoscale soil lysimeter
   (0.6 m in diameter and 1.83 m in height). The tracer-experiment data
   showed that even though sidewall flow may not have been completely
   eliminated it was reduced to an undetectable level based on chloride
   distributions and time domain reflectometry measurements. However, a
   delicate balance exists between minimizing sidewall flow and
   significantly altering the natural water-flow dynamics when using
   annular rings. The simple design modification provides a means of using
   a disturbed column of soil to evaluate models of solute transport, and
   to study preferential flow and contaminant mobility without concern for
   spurious data due to artificial flow along the soil-wall interface of
   the lysimeter. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The development of improved methods for remediation of contaminated
   subsurface systems has emerged as a significant environmental priority.
   One technology that appears to have considerable promise involves the
   use of solubilization-enhancing agents, such as surfactants, cosolvents,
   dissolved organic matter (DOM), and complexing agents, to promote
   removal of immiscible-liquid and sorbed phase organic contaminants. We
   examined the use of six flushing agents, i.e., two anionic surfactants,
   two complexing agents (cyclodextrins), a humic acid, and an alcohol, for
   solubilizing and removing residual-phase immiscible liquid from porous
   media. The results of batch experiments conducted to measure the degree
   of trichloroethene (TCE) solubilization induced by these agents show
   that the solubility of TCE was enhanced between 3 and 57 times depending
   on the flushing agent. Column experiments were conducted to compare
   water and agent-enhanced flushing of Borden sand containing residual
   saturations of TCE. As expected, the total flushing volume necessary to
   remove the residual saturation was reduced substantially in the presence
   of all applied agents. The relative effectiveness of the agents varied
   based on the method of evaluation. On a mass-efficiency basis, SDS
   outperformed all other agents, whereas DOM provided the best performance
   on a molar-efficiency basis. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A stochastic theory of multiple species transport and transformation is
   developed for the problem of oxygen-limited biodegradation of
   contaminants in aquifers, considering the presence of transient
   microbial growth dynamics. The theory incorporates the effects of
   physical, chemical and microbiological heterogeneities into a stochastic
   analysis of the coupled transport/transformation equations for a system
   consisting of a contaminant, an oxidizer, i.e., dissolved oxygen: and
   active biomass in heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifers, The developed
   theory is used to quantify the effects of mean concentrations on the
   field scale coefficients of decay, retardation and macrodispersion, and
   to evaluate the assumption of a steady-state biomass, previously
   reported in the literature. A comparison between the steady state
   assumption {[}Miralles-Wilhelm, F., Gelhar, L.W., Kapoor, V., 1997.
   Stochastic analysis of oxygen-limited biodegration in three
   dimensionally in heterogeneous aquifers. Water Resour. Res., 33 (6)] and
   this work for hypothesized field conditions shows that the effects of
   transient microbial growth on the effective retardation factor and
   macrodispersivities are minor, while the effects are modest for the
   effective decay rate. Transient microbial growth dynamics are found to
   occur over most contaminant and dissolved oxygen mean concentration
   ranges, and therefore a transient mean balance equation for biomass
   should be included in modeling efforts directed at quantifying
   oxygen-limited biodegradation at field scales. As in previous research,
   the effective decay rate is found to be less than the mean, which
   results in a larger field scale contaminant half-life in a heterogenous
   aquifer, compared to that in a homogeneous aquifer. (C) 2000 Published

Abstract = {{Microbial and chemical sulfide oxidation activity and oxygen consumption
   was investigated in the active layer of pyritic mine tailings at
   Nanisivik Mine, located in a permafrost area on Baffin Island in
   northern Canada. Samples of tailings were collected up to a depth of 60
   cm in mid-August 1998 at 4 sites, for which the metabolic activity of
   sulfur- andiron-oxidizing leaching bacteria besides the chemical pyrite
   oxidation activity were measured on 39 tailings samples and 7 samples
   from a natural pyritic site by calorimetry. The tailings of varying age
   and water content were deposited under alkaline conditions. In situ
   oxygen uptake rates were measured at the tailings surface every third
   day, prior to sampling. In addition, cell:counts of iron(II), sulfur,
   and thiosulfate oxidizing, lithotrophic bacteria and chemoorganotrophic
   microorganisms were determined quantitatively by the
   most-probable-number technique or by agar-plating. Results show
   consistent pyrite oxidation rates based on in situ oxygen uptake rates,
   and laboratory heat output measurements. Litho- and organotrophic
   bacteria were found in the tailings. Calorimetric measurements revealed
   that the present bacterial activity is responsible for approximately one
   third of the ongoing oxidation. Although leaching bacteria have
   previously been found in the Arctic, this study is the first to prove
   the significance of bacterial activity in the overall pollution
   resulting from railings deposited in the Arctic. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The transport and biodegradation of 12 organic compounds (toluene,
   phenol, o-cresol, 2,6-, 3,5-dimethylphenol, naphthalene,
   l-methylnaphthalene, benzothiophene, dibenzofuran, indole, acridine, and
   quinoline) were studied at a field site located on the: island of Funen,
   Denmark, where a clayey till 10-15 m deep overlies a sandy aquifer. The
   upper 4.8 m of till is highly fractured and the upper 2.5 m contains
   numerous root and worm holes,:A 1.5-2 m thick sand lens is encountered
   within the till at a depth of 4.8 m. Sampling points were installed at
   depths of 2.5 m, 4 m, and in the sand lens (5.5 m) to monitor the
   downward migration of a chloride tracer and the organic compounds. Water
   containing organic compounds and chloride was infiltrated into a 3 m x
   4.8 m basin at a rate of 8.8 m(3) day(-1) for 7 days. The mass of
   naphthalene relative to chloride was 0.39-0.98 for the sampling points
   located at a depth of 2.5 m, 0.11-0.61 for the sampling points located
   at a depth of 4 m, and 0-0.02 for the sampling points located in the
   sand lens. A similar pattern was observed for eight organic compounds
   for which reliable results were obtained (toluene, phenol, o-cresol,
   2,6-, 3,5-dimethylphenol, 1-methylnaphthalene, benzothiophene, and
   quinoline). This shows that the organic compounds were attenuated during
   the downward migration through the till despite the high infiltration
   rate. The attenuation process may be attributed to biodegradation. (C)

Abstract = {{Data from 90 tracer experiments performed in low-permeability fractured
   media have been studied to explore correlations among parameters
   controlling flow and transport, The original data had been interpreted
   by different authors using different models, which prevents direct
   comparison of their estimated parameters. In order to produce comparable
   parameters, the data have been reexamined using simple models
   (homogeneous domain, steady-state flow regime, single porosity).
   Specifically, hydraulic conductivity has been derived as the ratio of
   water flux:to head gradient and apparent porosity as the ratio of water
   velocity to water flux; the former estimated from both first and peak
   arrival times, Hydraulic conductivity and porosity correlate along a
   straight line of slope 1:3 in log scale. While the regression is too
   noisy to be of predictive use, it lends some support to the use of a
   generalized cubic law. The fact that correlation for Gst arrival time
   porosity (0.77) is larger than for peak arrival porosity (0.62) suggests
   that first arrival is controlled by the same flow paths as hydraulic
   conductivity. Apparent porosity derived from peak arrival time is found
   to grow with travel time along a line of 0.55 slope (again log scale).
   The correlation coefficient ranges between 0.73 and 0.80 (depending on
   the data set) for hard:rocks. The fact that this correlation is
   maintained when varying the flow rate at a given site leads us to
   suggest that it is caused by diffusion mechanisms. This conclusion is
   further supported by the increase of apparent porosity with the matrix
   porosity of the rock on which the experiments were performed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{In most contaminant transport modeling studies, only the macropores that
   are visible at the soil surface are considered. Furthermore, it is
   assumed that these macropores are straight and continuous throughout the
   soil profile. Little is known on the importance of other types of
   macropore continuity and tortuosity on preferential movement of
   contaminants through soils. This paper describes the results of a
   laboratory study dealing with macropore continuity effects on
   breakthrough curves (BTCs) and solute distribution in a Forman loam
   (fine-loamy mixed Udic Haploborolls) soil. BTCs were obtained under a
   constant hydraulic head of 0.08 m from a 2-D column (slab) containing
   artificial macropores, The input solution contained 1190 mg l(-1) KBr,
   10 mg:l(-1) Rhodamine WT, and 100 mg l(-1) FD\&C Blue \#1. The
   continuity types studied were: macropore open at the soil surface-open
   at the bottom of the column (O-O), open-closed (O-C), closed-open (C-O),
   and closed-closed (C-C). A treatment without macropore served as a
   control, As expected, the solution in the O-O treatment reached the
   bottom of the macropore about 100 times faster by bypassing most of the
   soil matrices. As a result, the breakthrough time for O-O treatments was
   much faster than any other continuity treatments Both the O-O and O-C
   type macropores favored earlier breakthrough, smaller apparent
   retardation coefficient (RI), deeper center of mass, and higher
   anisotropy in tracer concentrations in the horizontal direction than the
   C-O, C-C, and the Control treatment. The C-C macropore was favored in
   deeper penetration of tracer only when another macropore was present
   nearby. The importance of macropore continuity increased with an
   increase in the adsorption coefficient of the tracers. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The paper describes the results of a laboratory study on the effects of

   in a Forman loam (fine loamy-mixed Udic Haploborolls) soil. ETC were
   obtained using 2-D columns (slab) containing artificial macropores of
   five different tortuosity levels, The BTCs were run under a constant
   hydraulic head of 0.08 m over an initially air dry soil. The input
   solutions contained 1190 mg l(-1) of potassium bromide, 10 mg l(-1) of
   Rhodamine WT, and 100 mg l(-1) of FD\&C Blue \#1, A soil column without
   macropores served as a control. The displacement of a non-adsorbed
   tracer was not affected by the tortuosity level. An increase in
   macropore tortuosity progressively increased the breakthrough time,
   increased the apparent retardation coefficient (RI), decreased the depth
   to the center of mass of a given adsorbed tracer, and increased the
   anisotropy in tracer distribution profile. The relative importance of
   macropore tortuosity increased with an increase in the adsorption
   coefficient of the tracer, Compared to macropore continuity, the
   macropore tortuosity had greater impact on solute distribution profile
   than in its leaching. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Gravity-driven preferential flow (fingering) can greatly affect how one
   fluid displaces another in the subsurface. We have studied the internal
   properties of these preferential flow paths for water, with and without
   surfactants, infiltrating into oil saturated porous media using
   synchrotron X-rays, and miniature tensiometers to characterize fluid
   content and pressure relationships. We also used a light transmission
   technique to visualize overall flow pattern. Capillary pressure and
   water content decrease behind the front, similar to fingers in air-dry
   sand, with quantitative differences for five different surfactants with
   surface tensions ranging from 4-21 g/s(2). Using unstable flow theory,
   the finger widths, capillary pressure drops within the fingers, finger
   tip lengths,; and finger splitting dynamics were scaled successfully
   with interfacial tension, fluid density, and the contact angle using the
   fingers in air-water systems as the reference. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A Lagrangian stochastic framework was used to analyze field-scale
   aerobic biodegradation in a heterogeneous aquifer, using Monod-kinetics
   based reactions between the contaminant, oxygen and microbes. Subsurface
   heterogeneity was represented by closed-form travel time distributions,
   derived from a spatially correlated random hydraulic conductivity field:
   with a log-normal distribution. The solution to the coupled and
   nonlinear, one-dimensional Lagrangian transport equations was obtained
   using the operator-splitting technique. The presence of nitrate, and
   considering nitrate as a second electron acceptor, produced
   significantly different results under intrinsic conditions for different
   scales of heterogeneity and sorption. In general, nitrate as a second
   electron acceptor can substantially lower the peak contaminant
   concentration and increase the maximum remediation under various
   conditions of heterogeneity and sorption. There exists a critical value
   for retardation coefficients of both contaminant and microbes that
   produce complete degradation of mass, and this value depends on the
   availability of the electron acceptor(s) and is independent of the
   heterogeneity. Maximum remediation and peak contaminant concentration
   were sensitive to half-saturation constants, Enhanced remediation using
   oxygen and nitrate showed that maximum remediation can be increased by
   approximately 15\% when oxygen or nitrate concentration was increased by
   50\%, but a further increase may be obtained if injection occurred at a
   more effective location. The proposed stochastic methodology is capable
   of analyzing field-scale biodegradation using multiple electron
   acceptors in a simple and computationally attractive manner, producing
   useful results on design parameters. The key contributions arising from
   the Lagrangian stochastic framework in field-scale analysis, its
   limitations and potential approaches for overcoming these limitations
   are also discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Air sparging and soil vapor extraction (AS/SVE) are innovative
   remediation techniques that utilize volatilization and microbial
   degradation to remediate petroleum spills from soils and groundwater,
   This in situ study investigated the use of AS/SVE to remediate a
   gasoline spill from a leaking underground storage tank (UST) in the low
   permeability, clayey soil of the Appalachian Piedmont. The objectives of
   this study were to evaluate AS/SVE in low permeability soils by
   quantifying,petroleum mass removal rates, monitoring vadose zone
   contaminant levels, and comparing the mass extraction rates of
   continuous AS/SVE to 8 and 24 h pulsed operation. The objectives were
   met by collecting AS/SVE exhaust gas samples and vadose zone air from
   multi-depth soil vapor probes. Samples were analyzed for O-2, CO2, BTEX
   (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene), and total combustible
   hydrocarbon (TCH) concentrations using portable hand meters and gas
   chromatography. Continuous AS/SVE was effective in removing 608 kg of
   petroleum hydrocarbons from low permeability soil in 44 days (14.3 kg
   day(-1)). Mass removal rates ranged from 2.6 times higher to 5.1 times
   lower than other AS/SVE studies performed in sandy sediments. BTEX
   levels in the vadose zone were reduced from about 5 ppm to 1 ppm. Ten
   pulsed AS/SVE tests removed 78 kg in 23 days and the mean mass removal
   rate (17.6 kg day(-1)) was significantly higher than the last 15 days of
   continuous extraction; Pulsed operation may be preferable to continuous
   operation because of increased mass removal and decreased energy
   consumption. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Air sparging is a remediation technology currently being applied for the
   restoration of sites contaminated with volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs). Attempts have been made by various researchers to model the fate
   of VOCs in the gas and liquid phase during air sparging. In this study,
   a radial diffusion model with an air-water mass transfer boundary
   condition was developed and applied for the prediction of VOC
   volatilization from air sparging of contaminated soil columns, The
   approach taken was to use various parameters such as mass transfer
   coefficients and tortuosity factors determined previously in separate
   experiments using a single air channel apparatus and applying these
   parameters to a complex system with many air channels. Incorporated in
   the model, is the concept of mass transfer zone (MTZ) where diffusion of
   VOCs in this zone was impacted by the volatilization of VOCs at the
   air-water interface but with negligible impact outside the zone. The
   model predicted fairly well the change in the VOC concentrations in the
   exhaust air, the final average aqueous VOC concentration, and the total
   mass removed. The predicted mass removal was within 1\% to 20\% of the
   actual experimental mass removed. The results of the model seemed to
   suggest that air-sparged soil columns may be modeled as a composite of
   individual air channels surrounded by a MTZ, For a given air flow rate
   and air saturation, the VOC removal was found to be inversely
   proportional to the radius of the air channel. The-approach taken
   provided conceptual insights on mass transfer processes during air
   sparging operations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},
