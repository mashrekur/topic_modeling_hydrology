Abstract = {{Rosgen analysis, developed for assessing channel stability in streams
   from the western United States, is applied to the Oswego River watershed
   in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. The Rosgen method requires calibration
   to local conditions due to the impact of peat substrates on channel
   morphology. In particular, the presence of peat induces low width to
   depth ratios and greater channel confinement, reversing typical
   downstream morphologic trends observed in other rivers. Therefore peat
   is added to those substrates already evaluated by Rosgen. A consistent
   sequence of Rosgen stream types develops along the Oswego River and its
   tributaries created by spatially overlapping processes of water table
   emergence, peat development, and channel formation. This sequence
   delineates a ``natural{''} transition of stream channel morphology
   downslope through the watershed. First, as the water table reaches the
   surface of dry sloughs, Sphagnum growth is stimulated and peat
   substrates result. These substrates have lower permeability than the
   underlying gravelly sands. Next, surface runoff, through braided
   pathways over the peat, eventually erodes mainly anastomosing channels
   into the peat. Finally, single-thread channels develop in underlying
   gravelly sands further downslope. This downslope sequence, expressed as
   Rosgen stream types, begins generally with DA7 streams arising from dry
   sloughs. These pass to E7, C7 or DA5 stream types that in turn pass to
   B5c, C5 and C4 stream types. Departures from the ``natural{''} stream
   type sequence occur along the course of the Oswego and its tributaries
   due to human activities such as the construction of dams, bridges and
   drainage ditches, stream bank erosion at streamside camping and picnic
   areas and the clear-cutting of adjacent stands of Atlantic white cedar.}},

Abstract = {{The PnET-II model uses hydroclimatic data on maximum and minimum
   temperatures, precipitation, and solar radiation, together with
   vegetation and soil parameters, to produce estimates of net primary
   productivity, evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff on a monthly time step
   for forested areas. In this study, the PnET-II model was employed to
   simulate the hydrologic cycle for 17 Southeastern eight-digit hydrologic
   unit code (HUC) watersheds dominated by evergreen or deciduous tree
   species. Based on these control experiments, model biases were
   quantified and tentative revision schemes were introduced. Revisions
   included: (1) replacing the original single soil layer with three soil
   layers in the water balance routine; (2) introducing calibrating factors
   to rectify the phenomenon of overestimation of ET in spring and early
   summer months; (3) parameterizing proper values of growing degree days
   for trees located in different climate zones; and (4) adjusting the
   parameter of fast-flow (overland flow) fraction based on antecedent
   moisture condition and precipitation intensity. The revised PnET-II
   model, called PnET-II3SL in this work, substantially improved runoff
   simulations for the 17 selected experimental sites, and therefore may
   offer a more powerful tool to address issues in water resources
   management.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the applicability of Artificial Neural Networks
   (ANNs) for predicting salt build-up in the crop root zone. ANN models
   were developed with salinity data from field lysimeters subirrigated
   with brackish water. Different ANN architectures were explored by
   varying the number of processing elements (PEs) (from 1 to 30) for
   replicate data from a 0.4 m water table, 0.8 m water table, and both 0.4
   and 0.8 in water table lysimeters. Different ANN models were developed
   by using individual replicate treatment values as well as the mean value
   for each treatment. For replicate data, the models with twenty, seven,
   and six PEs were found to be the best for the water tables at 0.4 m, 0.8
   in and both water tables combined, respectively. The correlation
   coefficients between observed salinity and ANN predicted salinity of the
   test data with these models were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.89, respectively. The
   performance of the ANNs developed using mean salinity values of the
   replicates was found to be similar to those with replicate data. Not
   only was there agreement between observed and ANN predicted salinity
   values, the results clearly indicated the potential use of ANN models
   for predicting salt build-up in soil profile at a specific site.}},

   perceived as the sole solution for Tucson Basin's water problem. Soon
   after Central Arizona Project's water arrived in Tucson in 1992, its
   quality provoked a quarrel over its use for potable purposes. A
   significant outcome of that quarrel was the enactment of the 1995
   Proposition 200. The Proposition 200 precludes the use of Central
   Arizona Project's water for potable purposes, unless it is treated. Yet,
   it encourages using it for non-potable purposes and for replenishing the
   Tucson aquifer through recharge. This paper examines the economic issues
   involved in utilizing Central Arizona Project's water for recharge. Four
   planning scenarios were designed to measure and compare the costs and
   benefits with and without Central Arizona Project's water recharge.
   Cost-benefit analysis was utilized to measure recharge costs and
   benefits and to derive a rough estimate of cost savings from preventing
   land subsidence. The results indicate that the institutional
   requirements can be met with Central Arizona Project's water recharge.
   The economic benefits from reducing pumping cost and saving groundwater
   are not economically significant. Yet, when combining the use of Central
   Arizona Project's water for recharge and non-potable purposes, it
   demonstrates positive net economic benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Shallow ground water in areas of increasing urban development within the
   Upper Colorado River Basin was sampled for inorganic and organic
   constituents to characterize water-quality conditions and to identify
   potential anthropogenic effects resulting from development. In 1997, 25
   shallow monitoring wells were installed and sampled in five areas of
   urban development in Eagle, Grand, Gunnison, and Summit Counties,
   Colorado. The results of this study indicate that the shallow ground
   water in the study area is suitable for most uses. Nonparametric
   statistical methods showed that constituents and parameters measured in
   the shallow wells were often significantly different between the five
   developing urban areas. Radon concentrations exceeded the proposed USEPA
   maximum contaminant level at all sites. The presence of nutrients,
   pesticides, and volatile organic compounds indicate anthropogenic
   activities are affecting the shallow ground-water quality in the study
   area. Nitrate as N concentrations greater than 2.0 mg/L were observed in
   ground water recharged between the 1980s and 1990s. Low concentrations
   of methylene blue active substances were detected at a few sites. Total
   coliform bacteria were detected at ten sites; however, E. coli was not
   detected. Continued monitoring is needed to assess the effects of
   increasing urban development on the shallow ground-water quality in the
   study area.}},

Abstract = {{The climate of Southern Arizona is dominated by summer precipitation,
   which accounts for over 60 percent of the annual total. Summer and
   non-summer precipitation data from the USDA-ARS Walnut Gulch
   Experimental Watershed are analyzed to identify trends in precipitation
   characteristics from 1956 to 1996. During this period, annual
   precipitation increased. The annual precipitation increase can be
   attributed to an increase in precipitation during non-summer months, and
   is paralleled by an increase in the proportion of annual precipitation
   contributed during non-summer months. This finding is consistent with
   previously reported increases in non-summer precipitation in the
   southwestern United States. Detailed event data were analyzed to provide
   insight into the characteristics of precipitation events during this
   time period. Precipitation event data were characterized based on the
   number of events, event precipitation amount, 30-minute event intensity,
   and event duration. The trend in non-summer precipitation appears to be
   a result of increased event frequency since the number of events
   increased during nonsummer months, although the average amount per
   event, average event intensity, and average event duration did not.
   During the summer ``monsoon{''} season, the frequency of recorded
   precipitation events increased but the average precipitation amount per
   event decreased. Knowledge of precipitation trends and the
   characteristics of events that make up a precipitation time series is a
   critical first step in understanding and managing water resources in
   semiarid ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning techniques are finding more and more applications in
   the field of forecasting. A novel regression technique, called Support
   Vector Machine (SVM), based on the statistical learning theory is
   explored in this study. SVM is based on the principle of Structural Risk
   Minimization as opposed to the principle of Empirical Risk Minimization
   espoused by conventional regression techniques. The flood data at Dhaka,
   Bangladesh, are used in this study to demonstrate the forecasting
   capabilities of SVM. The result is compared with that of Artificial
   Neural Network (ANN) based model for one-lead day to seven-lead day
   forecasting. The improvements in maximum predicted water level errors by
   SVM over ANN for four-lead day to seven-lead day are 9.6 cm, 22.6 cm,
   4.9 cm and 15.7 cm, respectively. The result shows that the prediction
   accuracy of SVM is at least as good as and in some cases (particularly
   at higher lead days) actually better than that of ANN, yet it offers
   advantages over many of the limitations of ANN, for example in arriving
   at ANN's optimal network architecture and choosing useful training set.
   Thus, SVM appears to be a very promising prediction tool.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the streamflow characteristics of the upper
   Allegheny River during the periods preceding (1936 to 1965) and
   following (1966 to 1997) completion of the Kinzua Dam in northwestern
   Pennsylvania. Inter-period trends in seasonal patterns of discharge and
   peak flow at three downstream sites are compared to those at two
   upstream sites to determine the influence of this large dam on surface
   water hydrology. Climatic records indicate that significant changes in
   annual total and seasonal precipitation occurred over the twentieth
   century. Increased runoff during the late summer through early winter
   led to increased discharge both upstream and downstream during these
   months, while slightly less early-year rainfall produced minor
   reductions in spring flood peaks since 1966. The Kinzua Dam
   significantly enhanced these trends downstream, creating large
   reductions in peak flow, while greatly augmenting low flow during the
   growing season. This reduction in streamflow variability, coupled with
   other dam-induced changes, has important biodiversity implications. The
   downstream riparian zone contains numerous threatened/endangered
   species, many of which are sensitive to the type of habitat
   modifications produced by the dam. Flood dynamics under the current
   post-dam conditions are likely to compound the difficulties of
   maintaining their long-term viability.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable estimates of evapotranspiration from areas of wildland
   vegetation are needed for many types of water-resource investigations.
   However, little is known about surface fluxes from many areally
   important vegetation types, and relatively few comparisons have been
   made to examine how well evapotranspiration models can predict
   evapotranspiration for soil-, climate-, or vegetation-types that differ
   from those under which the models have been calibrated. In this
   investigation at a prairie site in west-central Florida, latent heat
   flux (lambdaE) computed from the energy balance and alternatively by
   eddy covariance during a 15-month period differed by 4 percent and 7
   percent on hourly and daily time scales, respectively, Annual
   evapotranspiration computed from the energy balance and by eddy
   covariance were 978 and 944 mm, respectively. An hourly Penman-Monteith
   (PM) evapotranspiration model with stomatal control predicated on
   water-vapor-pressure deficit at canopy level, incoming solar radiation
   intensity, and soil water deficit was developed and calibrated using
   surface fluxes from eddy covariance. Model-predicted lambdaE agreed
   closely with lambdaE computed from the energy balance except when
   moisture from dew or precipitation covered vegetation surfaces. Finally,
   an hourly PM model developed for an Amazonian pasture predicted lambdaE
   for the Florida prairie with unexpected reliability. Additional
   comparisons of PM-type models that have been developed for differing
   types of short vegetation could aid in assessing interchangeability of
   such models.}},

Abstract = {{In order to establish meaningful nutrient criteria, consideration must
   be given to the spatial variations in geographic phenomena that cause or
   reflect differences in nutrient concentrations in streams, Regional
   differences in stream nutrient concentrations were illustrated using
   stream data collected from 928 nonpoint-source watersheds distributed
   throughout the country and sampled as part of the U.S. EPA National
   Eutrophication Survey (NES). Spatial patterns in the differences were
   compared and found to correspond with an a priori regional
   classification system based on regional patterns in landscape attributes
   associated with variation in nutrient concentrations. The classification
   consists of 14 regions composed of aggregations of the 84 U.S. EPA Level
   III Ecoregions. The primary distinguishing characteristics of each
   region and the factors associated with variability in water quality
   characteristics are presented. The use of the NES and many other extant
   monitoring data sets to develop regional reference conditions for
   nutrient concentrations in streams is discouraged on the basis of sample
   representation. The necessity that all sites used in such an effort be
   regionally representative and consistently screened for least possible
   impact is emphasized. These sampling issues are rigorously addressed by
   the U.S. EPA Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP). A
   case-study, using EMAP data collected from the Central and Eastern
   Forested Uplands, demonstrates how regional reference conditions and
   draft nutrient criteria could be developed.}},

Abstract = {{Using a Geographic Information System (GIS), a method is presented to
   develop a spatially explicit time series of land use in an urbanizing
   watershed. The method is prefaced on the existence of independent
   observations of land use at different times and data that describes the
   spatial-temporal land use transition characteristics of the watershed
   between these two points in time. A method is then presented to
   generalize the TR-55 graphical method, a common lumped hydrologic model
   for estimating peak discharge, for use in a spatially explicit scheme.
   This scheme predicts peak discharge throughout a watershed, rather than
   at a single selected watershed outlet. Coupling these two methods allows
   the engineer to model both the temporal and spatial evolution of peak
   discharge for the watershed. An illustrative watershed in a suburban
   area of Washington, DC is selected to demonstrate the methods. The model
   results from these analyses are presented graphically to highlight the
   complex features in peak discharge behavior that exist both spatially,
   as a function of position within the watershed drainage network, and
   temporally, as the watershed undergoes urbanization. These features are
   not commonly noted in most hydrologic analyses but are captured in these
   analyses because of the high spatial and temporal resolution of the
   methods presented. The physical implications of the modeled results are
   discussed in the context of the information content of a stream gauge
   located at the overall outlet of the illustrative watershed. This work
   shows that the common practice of transposition of gauge information to
   locations internal to the watershed would neglect internal variability
   in peak discharge behavior, and could potentially lead to the
   determination of inappropriate design discharges.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of aquatic plants in open-channels has many adverse
   environmental effects including, but not limited to, impeding the
   transport of water, hindering navigation, increasing flood elevations,
   increasing sediment deposition, and degrading water quality. Existing
   control strategies include physical removal and chemical treatment.
   Physical removal is only a temporary solution and chemical treatment is
   unacceptable if the water will be consumed by humans. The hydrodynamic
   method can wash out the encroached aquatic plants by keeping flow
   velocity higher than the critical velocity required to bend and rupture
   (lodge) their stems. This approach is a promising, physically-based,
   efficient, economic, and permanent solution for this problem. However,
   the success of this approach requires the accurate prediction of the
   critical lodging velocity. This paper presents an analytic study of the
   lodging velocity for the submerged portion of aquatic plants of narrow
   leaved emergent stems that are wider at bottom than the top. Based on
   the principles of engineering materials and the theory of turbulent
   flow, a semi-empirical formula is derived for the prediction of the
   critical lodging velocity. It indicates that the lodging of aquatic
   plants is controlled not only by flow conditions but also the geometric
   and mechanical characteristics of the plants. These analytic results
   provide a satisfactory explanation of the lodging phenomena observed in
   the field and are verified by the available experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Fecal-indicator bacteria were sampled at 14 stream sites in Anchorage,
   Alaska, USA, as part of a study to determine the effects of urbanization
   on water quality. Population density in the subbasins sampled ranged
   from zero to 1,750 persons per square kilometer. Higher concentrations
   of fecal-coliform, E. coli, and enterococci bacteria were measured at
   the most urbanized sites. Although fecal-indicator bacteria
   concentrations were higher in summer than in winter, seasonal
   differences in bacteria concentrations generally were not significant.
   Areas served by sewer systems had significantly higher fecal-indicator
   bacteria concentrations than did areas served by septic systems. The
   areas served by sewer systems also had storm drains that discharged
   directly to the streams, whereas storm sewers were not present in the
   areas served by septic systems. Fecal-indicator bacteria concentrations

Abstract = {{Design of bridges spanning tidal estuaries or bays requires an estimate
   of peak tidal flow. One common approach to estimating these flows
   (Neill's method) uses a first-order approximation of uniform water
   surface rise in the water body. For larger water bodies, the assumptions
   of this method are decreasingly valid. This study develops a simple
   modification that accounts for the spatial variability in the response
   of tidal waterways to storm surge flows. The peak tidal flow predicted
   by Neill's equation is compared to the peak flow determined by numerical
   simulation of estuaries with simple geometries, ranging from 1 to 25 km
   in length, using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers one-dimensional
   unsteady flow model, UNET. Results indicate that, under certain
   conditions, it may be appropriate to apply a correction factor to the
   peak discharge and peak velocity predicted by Neill's method, An
   algorithm, developed by nonlinear regression, is presented for computing
   correction factors based on estuary length, shape, mean depth, and
   storm-tide characteristics. The results should permit the design of more
   reliable, cost-effective structures by providing more realistic
   estimates of the potential for bridge scour in tidal water-ways,
   especially when a full solution of the unsteady flow equations is
   impractical.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Better Assessment Science
   Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources (BASINS) watershed management
   system. BASINS data were used with the KPSM model to predict discharge
   and sediment concentrations at the outlet of a 103 km(2) Ohio watershed.
   It was concluded that the NPSM model should always be calibrated but
   only a few of the parameters provided with BASINS needed to be
   calibrated. For a three-year study period, there was a 2 percent
   underestimation of discharge using area weighted precipitation values
   and a 25 percent overestimation using the single station data in BASINS.
   A comparison of observed and predicted monthly discharge resulted in an
   r(2) of 0.86 with area-weighted precipitation and an r(2) of 0.74 with
   the single station data. Calibrating the model to substantially improve
   sediment predictions was unsuccessful and we concluded that a
   calibration period of one year was too short. For the three-year study
   period, the r(2) for sediment was 0,36 with a slope of 0.37 and an
   intercept of 18.8 mg/l. The mean observed and predicted sediment
   concentrations were 27.1 mg/l and 22.6 mg/l, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1991, the U.S. Geological Survey has been conducting the National
   Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program to determine the quality of the
   Nation's water resources. In an effort to obtain a better understanding
   of why pesticides are found in shallow ground water on a national scale,
   a set of factors likely to affect the fate and transport of two
   herbicides in the subsurface were examined. Atrazine and metolachlor
   were selected for this discussion because they were among the most
   frequently detected pesticides in ground water during the first phase of
   the NAWQA Program (1993 to 1995), and each was the most frequently
   detected compound in its chemical class (triazines and acetanilides,
   respectively). The factors that most strongly correlated with the
   frequencies of atrazine detection in shallow ground-water networks were
   those that provided either: (1) an indication of the potential
   susceptibility of ground water to atrazine contamination, or (2) an
   indication of relative ground-water age. The factors most closely
   related to the frequencies of metolachlor detection in ground water,
   however, were those that estimated or indicated the intensity of the
   agricultural use of metolachlor. This difference is probably the result
   of detailed use estimates for these compounds being available only for
   agricultural settings. While atrazine use is relatively extensive in
   nonagricultural settings, in addition to its widespread agricultural
   use, metolachlor is used almost exclusively for agricultural purposes.
   As a result, estimates of agricultural applications provide a less
   reliable indication of total chemical use for atrazine than for
   metolachlor. A multivariate analysis demonstrated that the factors of
   interest explained about 50 percent of the variance in atrazine and
   metolachlor detection frequencies among the NAWQA land-use studies
   examined. The inclusion of other factors related to pesticide fate and
   transport in ground water, or improvements in the quality and accuracy
   of the data employed for the factors examined, may help explain more of
   the remaining variance in the frequencies of atrazine and metolachlor
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian buffers are increasingly important as watershed management
   tools and are cost-shared by programs such as Conservation Reserve that
   are part of the USDA Conservation Buffer Initiative. Riparian buffers as
   narrow as 4.6 m (15ft) are eligible for cost-share by USDA. The Riparian
   Ecosystem Management Model (REMM) provides a tool to judge water quality
   improvement by buffers and to set design criteria for nutrient and
   sediment load reduction. REMM was used for a Coastal Plain site to
   simulate 14 different buffers ranging from 4.6 m to 51.8 m (15 to 170
   ft) with three different types of vegetation (hardwood trees, pine
   trees, and perennial grass) with two water and nutrient loads. The load
   cases were low sediment/low nutrient - typical of a well managed
   agricultural field and low sediment/high nutrient - typical of liquid
   manure application to perennial forage crops. Simulations showed that
   the minimum width buffer (4.6 m) was inadequate for control of nutrients
   under either load case. The minimum width buffer that is eligible for
   cost share assistance on a field with known water quality problems (10.7
   m, 35 ft) was projected to achieve at least 50 percent reduction of N,
   P, and sediment in the load cases simulated.}},

Abstract = {{Inherent site factors can generate substantial variation in the ground
   water nitrate removal capacity of riparian zones. This paper examines
   research in the glaciated Northeast to relate variability in ground
   water nitrate removal to site attributes depicted in readily available
   spatial databases, such as SSURGO. Linking site-specific studies of
   riparian ground water nitrate removal to spatial data can help target
   high-value riparian locations for restoration or protection and improve
   the modeling of watershed nitrogen flux. Site attributes, such as hydric
   soil status (soil wetness) and geomorphology, affect the interaction of
   nitrate-enriched ground water with portions of the soil ecosystem
   possessing elevated biogeochemical transformation rates (i.e.,
   biologically active zones). At our riparian sites, high ground water
   nitrate-N removal rates were restricted to hydric soils. Geomorphology
   provided insights into ground water flowpaths. Riparian sites located on
   outwash and organic/alluvial deposits have high potential for
   nitrate-enriched ground water to interact with biologically active
   zones. In till deposits, ground water nitrate removal capacity may be
   limited by the high occurrence of surface seeps that markedly reduce the
   time available for biological transformations to occur within the
   riparian zone. To fully realize the value of riparian zones for nitrate
   retention, landscape controls of riparian nitrate removal in different
   climatic and physiographic regions must be determined and translated
   into available spatial databases.}},

Abstract = {{The relation of fish community composition to riparian cover at two
   spatial scales was compared at 18 streams in the agricultural Minnesota
   River Basin. The two spatial scales were: (1) local riparian zone (a 200
   meter wide buffer extending 2 to 3 kilometers upstream of the sampling
   reach); and (2) the upstream riparian zone (a 200 m wide buffer on the
   mainstem and all perennial tributaries upstream of the sampling reach).
   Analysis of variance indicated that streams with wooded-local riparian
   zones had greater fish species richness (means = 20 and 15,
   respectively) and Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) scores (means = 40 and
   26, respectively) than streams with open-local riparian zones. Streams
   with wooded-upstream riparian zones tended (were not statistically
   significant) to have greater numbers of species (means = 19 and 15,
   respectively) and IBI scores (means = 33 and 28, respectively) than
   streams with open-upstream riparian zones. There was no significant
   interaction between the riparian zone conditions at the two scales. This
   study suggests that maintenance of wooded riparian cover along streams
   could be effective in maintaining or improving fish community
   composition in streams draining heavily agricultural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate analyses and correlations revealed strong relations between
   watershed and riparian-corridor land cover, and reach-scale habitat
   versus fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages in 38 warmwater streams in
   eastern Wisconsin. Watersheds were dominated by agricultural use, and
   ranged in size from 9 to 71 km(2). Watershed land cover was summarized
   from satellite-derived data for the area outside a 30-m buffer. Riparian
   land cover was interpreted from digital orthophotos within 10-, 10- to
   20-, and 20- to 30-m buffers. Reach-scale habitat, fish, and
   macroinvertebrates were collected in 1998 and biotic indices calculated.
   Correlations between land cover, habitat, and stream-quality indicators
   revealed significant relations at the watershed, riparian-corridor, and
   reach scales. At the watershed scale, fish diversity, intolerant fish
   and EPT species increased, and Hilsenhoff biotic index (HBI) decreased
   as percent forest increased. At the riparian-corridor scale, EPT species
   decreased and HBI increased as riparian vegetation became more
   fragmented. For the reach, EPT species decreased with embeddedness.
   Multivariate analyses further indicated that riparian (percent
   agriculture, grassland, urban and forest, and fragmentation of
   vegetation), watershed (percent forest) and reach-scale characteristics
   (embeddedness) were the most important variables influencing fish (IBI,
   density, diversity, number, and percent tolerant and insectivorous
   species) and macroinvertebrate (HBI and EPT) communities.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Geological Survey examined 25 agricultural streams in eastern
   Wisconsin to determine relations between fish, invertebrate, and algal
   metrics and multiple spatial scales of land cover, geologic setting,
   hydrologic, aquatic habitat, and water chemistry data. Spearman
   correlation and redundancy analyses were used to examine relations among
   biotic metrics and environmental characteristics. Riparian vegetation,
   geologic, and hydrologic conditions affected the response of biotic
   metrics to watershed agricultural land cover but the relations were
   aquatic assemblage dependent. It was difficult to separate the
   interrelated effects of geologic setting, watershed and buffer land
   cover, and base flow. Watershed and buffer land cover, geologic setting,
   reach riparian vegetation width, and stream size affected the fish IBI,
   invertebrate diversity, diatom IBI, and number of algal taxa; however,
   the invertebrate FBI, percentage of EPT, and the diatom pollution index
   were more influenced by nutrient concentrations and flow variability.
   Fish IBI scores seemed most sensitive to land cover in the entire stream
   network buffer, more so than watershed-scale land cover and segment or
   reach riparian vegetation width. All but one stream with more than
   approximately 10 percent buffer agriculture had fish IBI scores of fair
   or poor. In general, the invertebrate and algal metrics used in this
   study were not as sensitive to land cover effects as fish metrics. Some
   of the reach-scale characteristics, such as width/depth ratios,
   velocity, and bank stability, could be related to watershed influences
   of both land cover and geologic setting. The Wisconsin habitat index was
   related to watershed geologic setting, watershed and buffer land cover,
   riparian vegetation width, and base flow, and appeared to be a good
   indicator of stream quality. Results from this study emphasize the value
   of using more than one or two biotic metrics to assess water quality and
   the importance of environmental characteristics at multiple scales.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian zones perform a variety of biophysical functions that can be
   managed to reduce the effects of land use on instream habitat and water
   quality. However, the functions and human uses of riparian zones vary
   with biophysical factors such as landform, vegetation, and position
   along the stream continuum. These variations mean that ``one size fits
   all{''} approaches to riparian management can be ineffective for
   reducing land use impacts. Thus riparian management planning at the
   watershed scale requires a framework that can consider spatial
   differences in riparian functions and human uses. We describe a pilot
   riparian zone classification developed to provide such a framework for
   riparian management in two diverse river systems in the Waikato region
   of New Zealand. Ten classes of riparian zones were identified that
   differed sufficiently in their biophysical features to require different
   management. Generic ``first steps{''} and ``best practical{''} riparian
   management recommendations and associated costs were developed for each
   riparian class. The classification aims to not only improve our
   understanding of the effectiveness of riparian zone management as a
   watershed management tool among water managers and land owners, but to
   also provide a basis for deciding on management actions.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated spatial and temporal relationships among surface and
   subsurface watershed attributes and stream nutrient concentrations in
   urbanizing Johnson Creek watershed in northern Oregon. We sampled stream
   water at eight urban and five nonurban locations from March 1998 through
   December 1999. We sampled eight wells distributed over the two primary
   aquifers in the watershed. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS),
   percentages of landuse attributes within a radius of 30, 91, and 152 in
   from each sample site were quantified. We analyzed relationships between
   (1) nutrient concentrations and percentage cover of different landuse
   attributes, and (2) nutrient concentrations and underlying hydrologic
   units. We did not find a significant relationship between ground water
   chemistry and stream water chemistry. We found elevated levels of
   phosphorus (P) concentrations correlated with urban landuse, while
   higher nitrogen (N) concentrations were correlated with nonurban
   (primarily agricultural) landuse. We concluded that elevated levels of N
   in nonurban areas of Johnson Creek watershed were associated with
   agricultural practices. We further concluded that urban development
   factors such as increases in storm drains, dry wells, and impermeable
   surfaces may be responsible for higher input of P to the stream in
   urbanizing areas of the Johnson Creek watershed.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated changes in channel habitat distributions, particle-size

   the channel edge. In the clearcut streams, logging debris covered or
   buried 98 percent of the channel length to an average depth of 0.94
   meters. The slash trapped fine sediment in the channel by inhibiting
   fluvial transport, and the average percentage of fines increased from 12
   percent to 44 percent. The trees along buffered streams served as a
   fence to keep out logging debris during the first summer following
   timber harvest. Particle size distributions and habitat distributions in
   the buffered and reference streams were largely unchanged from the
   pre-harvest to post-harvest surveys. The debris that buried the clearcut
   streams effectively shaded most of these streams and protected them from
   temperature increases. These surveys have documented immediate channel
   changes due to timber harvest, but channel conditions will evolve over
   time as the slash decays and becomes redistributed and as new vegetation
   develops on the channel margins.}},

Abstract = {{We analyzed the type of hydrologic adjustments resulting from flow
   regulation across a range of dam types, distributed throughout the
   Connecticut River watershed, using two approaches: (1) the Index of
   Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and (2) log-Pearson Type III flood frequency
   analysis. We applied these analyses to seven rivers that have extensive
   pre- and post-disturbance flow records and to six rivers that have only
   long post-regulation flow records. Lastly, we analyzed six unregulated
   streams to establish the regional natural flow regime and to test
   whether it has changed significantly over time in the context of an
   increase in forest cover from less than 20 percent historically to
   greater than 80 percent at present. We found significant hydrologic
   adjustments associated with both impoundments and land use change. On
   average, maximum peak flows decrease by 32 percent in impounded rivers,
   but the effect decreases with increasing flow duration. One-day minimum
   low flows increase following regulation, except for the hydro-electric
   facility on the mainstem. Hydrograph reversals occur more commonly now
   on the mainstem, but the tributary flood control structures experience
   diminished reversals. Major shifts in flood frequency occur with the
   largest effect occurring downstream of tributary flood control
   impoundments and less so downstream of the mainstem's hydroelectric
   facility. These overall results indicate that the hydrologic impacts of
   dams in humid environments can be as significant as those for large,
   multiple-purpose reservoirs in more and environments.}},

Abstract = {{Beaver (Castor canadensis) are habitat-modifying keystone species, and
   their activities broadly influence many other plants and animals. Beaver
   are especially important to waterfowl in the western U.S. where riparian
   and wetland habitats comprise less than 2 percent of the landscape yet
   provide habitat for greater than 80 percent of wildlife species. Wyoming
   is currently ranked sixth of the 50 states in the size of its breeding
   waterfowl population, and beaver ponds may play a significant role in
   providing habitat for these birds. The objectives of this research were
   to: (1) identify streams in Wyoming where beaver are currently present,
   extirpated, or used to manage riparian habitat; (2) identify areas where
   beaver could be relocated to create wetlands and improve riparian
   habitat; (3) compare wetland surface areas between areas that have
   beaver with those that did not; and (4) compare waterfowl numbers in
   areas with and without beaver. Using a survey of 125 land managers in
   Wyoming, we found that beaver have been removed from 23 percent (6,497
   km) of the streams for which managers had direct knowledge (28,297 km).
   The same managers estimated that there are over 3,500 km of streams
   where beaver could improve habitat conditions. The riparian width in
   streams with beaver ponds averaged 33.9 m (95 percent CI = 25.1-42.7 m)
   in contrast to 10.5 m CI = 8.6-12.4 m) in streams without beaver. During
   waterfowl surveys we counted 7.5 ducks/km (CI = 0.9-14.4 ducks/km) of
   stream in areas with beaver ponds and only 0.1 ducks/km (no CIs
   calculated) of stream in similar areas without beaver present. Beginning
   in 1994, we restored beaver to 14 streams throughout Wyoming in an
   effort to create wetlands and improve riparian habitat. Waterfowl have
   been quick to respond to these important habitats. We feel that beaver
   restoration and management can be used to improve habitat in drainages
   where conflicts with other land uses are minimal.}},

Abstract = {{The shape of a river channel is linked to surrounding land use through
   interacting hydrologic and geologic processes. This study analyzes the
   relationship between the change in nearstream land use and the shape of
   the adjacent river channel over time. Three watersheds in the foothills
   of the Venezuelan Andes that have experienced differing degrees of
   development were studied to determine river channel width, sinuosity,
   and position relative to surrounding land use. Change in land use over
   time was obtained from multiple-date aerial photographs (1946 and 1980)
   referenced to 1996 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, and
   verified by field inspection. Measurements of land-use type and amount
   and river channel morphology from the two dates were made using
   geographic information system (GIS) methods. The three watersheds
   differed in the extent of deforestation, the location of remaining
   forested land, and how much land-use change had already occurred by
   1946. Change in river channel morphology was greatest at the most
   deforested sites. Valley shape and channel constraint also had a
   discernible effect on change in channel morphology. This study
   introduces a method for analyzing change in coupled terrestrial-aquatic
   systems based on multiple-date, remotely sensed data and GIS analysis of
   spatial properties. The results document human impacts on river channels
   through a comparison of multiple watersheds over a 35-year time
   interval.}},

Abstract = {{A ``synthetic paired basin{''} technique that combines hydrologic
   monitoring and watershed modeling proves to be a useful tool in
   detecting hydrologic change in creeks draining basins undergoing
   urbanization. In this approach, measured stream flow following subbasin
   treatment (a period of urbanization) is compared with flow from a
   control subbasin over the same time period. The control subbasin is the
   pre-treatment subbasin itself as represented by a well-calibrated
   hydrologic model that is input with post-treatment meteorological data.
   The technique is illustrated for stream monitoring sites at the outlets
   of two high-resource sub-basins in the Bear Creek basin of King County,
   Washing-ton. Application of this technique holds promise to provide
   earlier warning of cumulative, human impacts on aquatic resources and to
   better inform adaptive watershed management for resource protection.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of cumulative impacts to riparian systems is an important yet
   elusive goal. Previous analyses have focused on comparing the number of
   hectares impacted to the number of hectares restored, without addressing
   the loss of riparian function or the effect of the spatial distribution
   of impacts. This paper presents an analysis of the spatial distribution
   of development-related impacts to riparian ecosystems, that were
   authorized under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Impacts on habitat
   structure, contiguity, and landscape context were evaluated using
   functional indices scaled to regional reference sites. Impact sites were
   mapped using GIS and analyzed for spatial associations. Positive spatial
   autocorrelation (i.e. clustering of impact sites) resulted from the
   piecemeal approach to impact assessment, which failed to prevent
   cumulative impacts. Numerous small projects in close proximity have
   resulted in adverse impacts to entire stream reaches or have fragmented
   the aquatic resources to a point where overall functional capacity is
   impaired. Additionally, the ecological functions of unaffected areas
   have been diminished due to their proximity to degraded areas. A
   proactive approach to managing cumulative impacts is currently being
   used in Orange County, California as part of a Corps of Engineers
   sponsored Special Area Management Plan (SAMP). The SAMP process is
   evaluating the ecological conditions and physical processes of the study
   watersheds and attempting to plan future development in a manner that
   will guard against cumulative impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian buffers have potential for reducing excess nutrient levels in
   surface water. Spatial variation in riparian buffer effectiveness is
   well recognized, yet researchers and managers still lack effective
   general tools for understanding the relevance of different hydrologic
   settings. We present several terrain-based GIS models to predict spatial
   patterns of shallow, subsurface hydrologic flux and riparian hydrology.
   We then link predictions of riparian hydrology to patterns of nutrient
   export in order to demonstrate potential for augmenting the predictive
   power of land use/land cover (LU/LC) maps. Using predicted hydrology in
   addition to LU/LC, we observed increases in the explained variation of
   nutrient exports from 290 sites across Lower Michigan. The results
   suggest that our hydrologic predictions relate more strongly to patterns
   of nutrient export than the presence or absence of wetland vegetation,
   and that in fact the influence of vegetative structure largely depends
   on its hydrologic context. Such GIS models are useful and complimentary
   tools for exploring the role of hydrologic routing in riparian ecosystem
   function and stream water quality. Modeling efforts that take a similar
   GIS approach to material transport might be used to further explore the
   causal implications of riparian buffers in heterogeneous watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the spatial patterns of plant species richness
   observed in 1989 and in 1999 alongside the Adour River (Southwest
   France), focussing on: (1) upstream-to-downstream changes, (2) mid-term
   changes, and (3) differences in observed patterns among various plant
   functional groups. The purpose of the research was to analyze how the
   proportions of invading species and/or ruderal species within riparian
   corridors can be related to regional environmental settings. About half
   of native and exotic species were ruderals. However, the proportion of
   competitors was higher within the native pool. No correlation was found
   between exotic and native functional groups. The longitudinal
   distribution of native and exotic ruderal species were correlated
   together, but they were not correlated with the total species richness.
   Converse to observations at the local scale in other studies, these
   patterns seem to be driven more by factors co-varying with the size of
   the river and by climatic factors than by hydrological
   disturbance-related factors. The role of the various plant groups
   studied and potential consequences on ecosystem function are discussed
   in the context of an increasing susceptibility of our riparian corridors
   to invasions by nonriparian species. Management perspectives are
   discussed for the purpose of biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed first- to third-order streams (channel widths from 1.4 to 10
   m) in the southeastern slopes of the Cascade Range of Washington and
   found two distinct endpoints of riparian vegetation. Where the forest
   overstory is dominated by park-like Ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa),
   channels are commonly bordered with a dense scrub-shrub vegetation
   community. Where fire suppression and/or lack of active riparian zone
   management have resulted in dense encroachment of fir forests that
   create closed forest canopies over the channel, scrub-shrub vegetation
   communities are virtually absent near the channel. Other factors being
   equal, distinct differences in channel morphology exist in streams
   flowing thru each riparian community. The scrub-shrub channels have more
   box-like cross-sections, lower width-to-depth ratios, more pools, more
   undercut banks, more common sand-dominated substrates, and similar
   amounts of woody debris (despite lower tree density). Temperature
   comparisons of forest and scrub-shrub sections of two streams indicate
   that summer water temperatures are slightly lower in the scrub-shrub
   streams. We surmise that these morphology and temperature effects are
   driven by differences in root density and canopy conditions that alter
   dynamic channel processes between each riparian community. We suspect
   that the scrub-shrub community was more common in the landscape prior to
   the 20th century and may have been the dominant native riparian
   community for these stream types. We therefore suggest that managing
   these streams for dense riparian conifer does not mimic natural
   conditions, nor does it provide superior in-stream habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Intact riparian zones are the product of an incredibly complex multitude
   of linkages between the geomorphic, hydrologic, and biotic features of
   the ecosystem. Land-use activities that sever or alter these linkages
   result in ecosystem degradation. We examined the relationship between
   riparian vegetation and channel morphology by sampling species
   composition and herbaceous root biomass in incised (down-cut and
   widened) versus unincised (intact) sections of unconstrained reaches in
   three headwater streams in northeastern Oregon. Incision resulted in a
   compositional shift from wetland-obligate plant species to those adapted
   to drier environments. Root biomass was approximately two times greater
   in unincised sections than incised sections and decreased with depth
   more rapidly in incised sections than in unincised sections. Total root
   biomass ranged from 2,153 g m(-2) to 4,759 g m(-2) in unincised sections
   and from 1,107 g m(-2) to 2,215 g m(-2) in incised sections. In
   unincised sections less than 50 percent of the total root biomass was
   found in the top 10 cm, with approximately 20 percent in successive
   10-cm depth increments. In contrast, incised sections had greater than
   60 percent of the total root biomass in the top 10 cm, approximately 15
   percent in the 10 to 20 cm depth, less than 15 percent in the 20 to 30
   cm depth, and less than 10 percent in the 30 to 40 cm depth. This
   distribution of root biomass suggests a positive feedback between
   vegetation and channel incision: as incision progresses, there is a loss
   of hydrologic connectivity, which causes a shift to a drier vegetation
   assemblage and decreased root structure, resulting in a reduced erosive
   resistance capacity in the lower zone of the streambank, thereby
   allowing further incision and widening.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian areas interact with aquatic and upland conditions and therefore
   help determine the degree of functionality (streambank stability, shade,
   sediment, and debris filtering) found in a watershed or catchment. Thus,
   conditions in riparian areas exert significant influence on water
   quality. Physical and biological factors (biophysical determinants) that
   influence these conditions and determine long-term site ecology include
   topographic variables, geology, climate, soil texture, and others. These
   conditions are further modified by management infrastructure (roads,
   dikes, etc.). Our objective was to develop a system for evaluating site
   condition in relation to site capability. Since biophysical determinants
   and infrastructure interact with water quality, our first task was to
   acquire data concerning the spatial distribution of biophysical
   determinants and infrastructure constraints and to import them into a
   GIS system where they could be managed and processed. To expedite
   analysis, determinants and infrastructure constraints were placed into a
   hierarchy capable of isolating various site capability types. The
   hierarchy was designed to incorporate multiscale effects. Site
   capability areas are georeferenced in this process thereby enabling
   efficient monitoring and providing a way to focus management on those
   areas needing improvement. Study tasks included: (1) landscape
   characterization and hierarchy selection, (2) field assessment, (3)
   information management and data mining, and (4) information
   interpretation and adaptive management. This approach appears to be an
   effective way to isolate general riparian site conditions, to provide
   indications about water quality, and to create strategies necessary for
   alleviating water quality problems.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of pesticides entering the Riparian Buffer Strips (RBS) has not
   been well documented. This study compared the transport and fate of
   atrazine in soil of three-, five-, and nine-year-old switchgrass
   (Panicum virgatum L.) RBS to that in adjacent soils cropped to a
   corn-soybean rotation or a grass-alfalfa pasture. Undisturbed soil
   columns were collected from the RBS and cropped areas within the Bear
   Creek watershed, near Roland, Iowa. Atrazine and bromide breakthrough
   curves obtained using intact soil columns under saturated conditions
   were described by a two-region, mobile-immobile transport model.
   Preferential flow of bromide and atrazine was evident in five- and
   nine-year-old RBS soil, but there was little difference in transport
   characteristics between these two RBS soils and the adjacent cropped
   soils. There was a trend towards an increase in dispersion coefficients
   between the five- and nine-year-old RBS sites, which suggests an
   increased degree of preferential flow with increasing RBS age. Despite
   similar texture and organic C contents, atrazine sorption was
   significantly greater in RBS soil than the adjacent cropped soil.
   Cropped soil degraded atrazine faster than the RBS soil. The rapid
   degradation of atrazine in the corn-soybean soil adjacent to the
   five-year-old RBS (atrazine half-life of 19 days) appeared to be due to
   a larger population of atrazine-degrading microorganisms.
   Atrazine-degrading microorganisms in the corn-soybean soil were 50,940
   Cells g(-1) soil compared with 2,970 cells g(-1) soil in 5-year-old RBS
   soil which resulted in 60 percent mineralization of {[}C-14-UL-atrazine]
   in the corn-soybean soil.}},

Abstract = {{We tracked vegetation succession on a debris-flow deposit in Oregon's
   Coast Range to examine factors influencing the development of riparian
   plant communities following disturbance. Plots were stratified across
   five areas of the deposit (bank slump, seep, upper and lower sediment
   wedge, log jam) the first growing season after debris flow. At six times
   during the next ten years we estimated cover of vascular plants and
   tallied density of woody plants. Plant colonization occurred within two
   years. Total cover increased two- to seven-fold on the five areas within
   three years. Red alder and salmonberry were the dominant species,
   although weedy herbs persisted where woody species were lacking.
   Ordination of cover data showed that the five areas remained
   floristically distinct over time, while undergoing similar shifts
   related to the increasing dominance of alder and salmonberry. Rapid
   height growth of alder allowed it to outcompete salmonberry and
   effectively capture most areas by the tenth year, even where sprouts
   from transported rhizomes gave salmonberry an early advantage. Our
   results suggest that successional patterns were influenced by substrate
   variability, species composition of initial colonizers, propagule
   sources and their distribution, and species life-history traits such as
   growth rate, competitive ability, and shade tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout western North America, willows and cottonwoods are dominant
   woody plants in riparian zones, streamside areas that are periodically
   flooded. This study compared tolerances of willows - Salix discolor, S.
   exigua, and S. lutea - and cottonwoods - Populus angustifolia, P.
   balsamifera, and P. deltoides - to water inundation, one component of
   stream flooding. Rooted cuttings were grown for 152 days in 10 cm tall
   pots in water depths from 2.5 to 10 cm (inundated). Shoot and root
   elongation growth of the inundated cottonwoods were reduced 23 and 45
   percent, while S. lutea was relatively unaffected and the inundated
   sandbar willow, S. exigua, displayed 72 and 43 percent increases in
   shoot and root elongation. The inundation reduced transpiration in R
   deltoides and for mature R balsamifera trees that were flooded by a
   small reservoir on Willow Creek, Alberta. Those flooded trees died in
   their second year of inundation. The greater inundation tolerance of
   willows versus cottonwoods is consistent with observations along Midvale
   Creek, Montana, where beaver dams created a pond in which P trichocarpa
   died while willows thrived after five years. These patterns of
   inundation tolerance are consistent with elevational zones of occurrence
   as willows - and particularly the sandbar willow - occur at low
   elevations close to the stream. The understanding of inundation
   tolerances should assist in the provision of hydrologic patterns that
   will conserve and restore these shrubs and trees along streams and could
   permit their establishment along artificial reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{Human land use is a major source of change in catchments in developing
   areas. To better anticipate the long-term effects of growth, land use
   planning requires estimates of how changes in land use will affect
   ecosystem processes and patterns across multiple scales of space and
   time. The complexity of biogeochemical and hydrologic interactions
   within a basin makes it difficult to scale up from process-based studies
   of individual reaches to watershed scales over multiple decades.
   Empirical models relating land use/land cover (LULC) to water quality
   can be useful in longterm planning, but require an understanding of the
   effects of scale on apparent land use-water quality relationships. We
   empirically determined how apparent relationships between water quality
   and LULC data change at different scales, using LULC data from the
   Willapa Bay watershed (Washington) and water quality data collected
   along the Willapa and North Rivers. Spatial scales examined ranged from
   the local riparian scale to total upstream catchment. The strength of
   the correlations between LULC data and longitudinal water quality trends
   varied with scale. Different water quality parameters also varied in
   their response to changes in scale. Intermediate scales of land use data
   generally were better predictors than local riparian or total catchment
   scales. Additional data from the stream network did not increase the
   strength of relationships significantly. Because of the likelihood of
   scale-induced artifacts, studies quantifying land use-water quality
   relationships performed at single scales should be viewed with great
   caution.}},

Abstract = {{Suspended sediment causes a range of environmental damage, including
   benthic smothering, irritation of fish gills, and transport of sorbed
   contaminants. Much of the impact, while sediment remains suspended, is
   related to its light attenuation, which reduces visual range in water
   and light availability for photosynthesis. Thus measurement of the
   optical attributes of suspended matter in many instances is more
   relevant than measurement of its mass concentration. Nephelometric
   turbidity an index of light scattering by suspended particles, has been
   widely used as a simple, cheap, instrumental surrogate for suspended
   sediment, that also relates more directly than mass concentration to
   optical effects of suspended matter. However, turbidity is only a
   relative measure of scattering (versus arbitrary standards) that has no
   intrinsic environmental relevance until calibrated to a `proper'
   scientific quantity. Visual clarity (measured as Secchi or black disc
   visibility) is a preferred optical quantity with immediate environmental
   relevance to aesthetics, contact recreation, and fish habitat. Contrary
   to common perception, visual clarity measurement is not particularly
   subjective and is more precise than turbidity measurement. Black disc
   visibility is inter-convertible with beam attenuation, a fundamental
   optical quantity that can be monitored continuously by beam
   transmissometry Visual clarity or beam attenuation should supplant
   nephelometric turbidity in many water quality applications, including
   environmental standards.}},

Abstract = {{A study of stream base flow and NO3-N concentration was conducted
   simultaneously in 51 subwatersheds within the 116-square-kilometer
   watershed of East Mahantango Creek near Klingerstown, Pennsylvania. The
   study was designed to test whether measurable results of processes and
   observations within the smaller watersheds were similar to or
   transferable to a larger scale. Ancillary data on land use were
   available for the small and large watersheds. Although the source of
   land-use data was different for the small and large watersheds,
   comparisons showed that the differences in the two land-use data sources
   were minimal. A land use-based water-quality model developed for the
   small-scale 7.3-square-kilometer watershed for a previous study
   accurately predicted NO3-N concentrations from sampling in the same
   watershed. The water-quality model was modified and, using the
   imagery-based land use, was found to accurately predict NO3-N
   concentrations in the subwatersheds of the large-scale
   116-square-kilometer watershed as well. Because the model accurately
   predicts NO3-N concentrations at small and large scales, it is likely
   that in second-order streams and higher, discharge of water and NO3-N is
   dominated by flow from smaller first-order streams, and the contribution
   of ground-water discharge to higher order streams is minimal at the
   large scale.}},

Abstract = {{Water from the Missouri River Basin is used for multiple purposes. The
   climatic change of doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide may produce
   dramatic water yield changes across the basin. Estimated changes in
   basin water yield from doubled CO2 climate were simulated using a
   Regional Climate Model (RegCM) and a physically based rainfall-runoff
   model. RegCM output from a five-year, equilibrium climate simulation at
   twice present CO2 levels was compared to a similar present-day climate
   run to extract monthly changes in meteorologic variables needed by the
   hydrologic model. These changes, simulated on a 50-km grid, were matched
   at a commensurate scale to the 310 subbasins in the rainfall-runoff
   model climate change impact analysis. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool
   (SWAT) rainfall-runoff model was used in this study. The climate changes
   were applied to the 1965 to 1989 historic period. Overall water yield at
   the mouth of the Basin decreased by 10 to 20 percent during spring and
   summer months, but increased during fall and winter. Yields generally
   decreased in the southern portions of the basin but increased in the
   northern reaches. Northern subbasin yields increased up to 80 percent:
   equivalent to 1.3 cin of runoff on an annual basis.}},

Abstract = {{A newly developed heuristic algorithm, Harmony Search, is applied to the

   Search found better values of parameters in the nonlinear Muskingum
   model than five other methods including another heuristic method,

   deviations between the observed and routed outflows), SAD (the sum of
   the absolute value of the deviations between the observed and routed
   outflows), DPO (deviations of peak of routed and actual flows), and DPOT
   (deviations of peak time of routed and actual outflow). Harmony Search
   also has the advantage that it does not require the process of assuming
   the initial values of design parameters. The sensitivity analysis of
   Harmony Memory Considering Rate showed that relatively large values of
   Harmony Memory Considering Rate makes the Harmony Search converge to a
   better solution.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Unrelenting pressure on limited surface water supplies requires
   increasingly sophisticated water management approaches. Climate
   forecasts of seasonal precipitation and temperature are potentially
   useful, but the operational water management community currently
   underutilizes them. However, some agencies in Arizona took unprecedented
   advantage of forecasts for a potentially wet winter during the 1997-1998
   El Nino event. This study investigates use of this information through a
   series of semistructured in-depth interviews with key personnel from
   agencies responsible for emergency management and water supply; their
   jurisdictions ranged from urban to rural and local to regional.
   Interviews investigated information acquisition, interpretation, and
   incorporation into specific decisions and actions. While unprecedented
   actions were taken by some water management agencies and no agencies
   implemented inappropriate measures, some missed opportunities for more
   effective response, primarily through inaction. This study reveals a
   variety of technical factors and institutional characteristics affecting
   forecast use. Study findings emphasize the need for: (a) closer ongoing
   relationships between forecast producers and users, (b) increased
   institutional flexibility to exploit the increasing skill of seasonal
   climate forecasts, (c) demonstration projects of effective forecast use,
   and (d) a regional forum to facilitate information transfer between the
   hydroclimatic research community and operational water managers.}},

Abstract = {{A subwatershed base map of 84 hydrologic subregions within the Columbia
   River Basin (approximately 58,361,000 ha) was developed following
   hierarchical principles of ecological unit mapping. Our primary
   objectives were to inspect the relations between direct and indirect
   biophysical variables in the prediction of valley bottom and stream type
   patterns, and to identify hydrologic subregions (based on these results)
   that had similar aquatic patterns for which consistent management
   practices could be applied. Realization of these objectives required:
   (1) stratified subsampling of valley bottom and stream type composition
   within selected subwatersheds, (2) identification of direct and indirect
   biophysical variables that were mappable across the basin and that
   exerted primary control on the distribution of sampled aquatic patterns,
   and (3) development of hydrologic subregion maps based on the primary
   biophysical variables identified. Canonical correspondence analysis
   indicated that a core set of 15 direct variables (e.g., average
   watershed slope, drainage density, ten-year peak flow) and 19 indirect
   variables (i.e., nine subsection groups, four lithology groups, and six
   potential vegetation settings) accounted for 31 and 30 percent
   (respectively) of valley bottom/stream type composition variability and
   84 and 80 percent (respectively) of valley bottom/stream type
   environmental variability within subsamples. The 19 indirect biophysical
   variables identified were used to produce an ecological unit
   classification of 7,462 subwatersheds within the basin by a hierarchical
   agglomerative clustering technique (i.e,, hydrologic subregions were
   identified). Discriminant analysis indicated that 13 direct biophysical
   variables could correctly assign 80 percent of the subwatersheds to
   their indirect biophysical classification, thus demonstrating the strong
   relation that exists between indirect biophysical based classifications
   (ecological units) and the direct biophysical variables that determine
   finer-level aquatic patterns. Our hydrologic subregion classifications
   were also effective in explaining observed differences in management
   hazard ratings across all subwatersheds of the basin. Results of this
   research indicate that ecological units can be effectively used to
   produce watershed classifications that integrate the effects of direct
   biophysical variables on finer-level aquatic patterns, and predict
   opportunities and limitations for management.}},

Abstract = {{The State of Texas has initiated the development of a Total Maximum
   Daily Load program in the Bosque River Watershed, where point and
   nonpoint sources of pollution are a concern. Soil Water Assessment Tool
   (SWAT) was validated for flow, sediment, and nutrients in the watershed
   to evaluate alternative management scenarios and estimate their effects
   in controlling pollution. This paper discusses the calibration and
   validation at two locations, Hico and Valley Mills, along the North
   Bosque River. Calibration for flow was performed from 1960 through 1998.
   Sediment and nutrient calibration was done from 1993 through 1997 at
   Hico and from 1996 through 1997 at Valley Mills. Model validation was
   performed for 1998. Time series plots and statistical measures were used
   to verify model predictions. Predicted values generally matched well
   with the observed values during calibration and validation (R-2 greater
   than or equal to 0.6 and Nash-Suttcliffe Efficiency greater than or
   equal to 0.5, in most instances) except for some underprediction of
   nitrogen during calibration at both locations and sediment and organic
   nutrients during validation at Valley Mills. This study showed that SWAT
   was able to predict flow, sediment, and nutrients successfully and can
   be used to study the effects of alternative management scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of regulators, resource managers, and consultants to assess
   accurately wetland hydrology is crucial when identifying and delineating
   wetlands. In this study, simple linear regression and long-term (ten
   year) New Jersey Pinelands stream gaging and pitch pine lowland
   water-level data sets were used to estimate long-term hydroperiods at
   lowland test sites with shortterm (two year) records, Separate
   regression equations were developed for each test site using reference
   site data and stream gaging data, and two sets of equations for selected
   test sites were produced using two different short-term periods of
   record. Test sites had long-term records ranging from four to ten years,
   allowing validation of the regression models. Measured and predicted
   test site growing season water levels were similar regardless of which
   shortterm period of record was used. The results based on the stream
   gaging site data were similar, although the difference between measured
   and estimated growing season water levels was greater when this approach
   was used. Excellent agreement was found between measured and estimated
   frequencies of near-surface saturation at test sites for each growing
   season month, and these relationships improved when cumulative, seasonal
   frequencies were considered. The reference wetland approach used in this
   study may have its greatest value in regions with both high development
   pressures and problem wetlands and may provide an effective way of
   resolving costly wetland delineation disputes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1203-1214}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, several approaches to hydrologic frequency analysis
   have been proposed that enable one to direct attention to that portion
   of an overall probability distribution that is of greatest interest. The
   majority of the studies have focused on the upper tail of a distribution
   for flood analyses, though the same ideas can be applied to low flows.
   This paper presents an evaluation of the performances of five different
   estimation methods that place an emphasis on fitting the lower tail of
   the lognormal distribution for estimation of the ten-year low-flow
   quantile. The methods compared include distributional truncation, MLE
   treatment of censored data, partial probability weighted moments,
   LL-moments, and expected moments. It is concluded that while there are
   some differences among the alternative methods in terms of their biases
   and root mean square errors, no one method consistently performs better
   than the others, particularly with recognition that the underlying
   population distribution is unknown. Therefore, it seems perfectly
   legitimate to make a selection of a method on the basis other criteria,
   such as ease of use. It is also shown in this paper that the five
   alternative methods can perform about as well as, if not better than, an
   estimation strategy involving fitting the complete lognormal
   distribution using L-moments.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of discharge in natural streams requires hydrographers
   to use accurate meters that have consistent performance among meters of
   the same model. This paper presents the results of an investigation into
   the accuracy and consistency of four models of current meters - Price
   Type-AA, Price Pygmy, Marsh McBirney 2000, and Swoffer 2100. Test
   results for six meters of each model are presented. Variation of meter
   performance within a model is used as an indicator of consistency, and
   percent velocity error that is computed from a measured reference
   velocity is used as an indicator of meter accuracy. Velocities measured
   by each meter are also compared to the manufacturer's published or
   advertised accuracy limits. The investigation found the Price models to
   be more accurate and consistent than the other models. The Price models
   met their respective accuracy limits over the range of test velocities
   better than the other models. The Marsh McBirney model usually measured
   within its accuracy specification. The Swoffer meters did not meet the
   stringent Swoffer accuracy limits for all the velocities tested. The
   Swoffer model had accuracies similar to the Price Type-AA model when
   individual meter rating equations were computed and used. Every model
   tested had meters that did not meet manufacturer accuracy limits.
   Because current meters are not consistently accurate within a model,
   hydrographers should periodically check meters against a velocity
   standard.}},

Abstract = {{The designs of stream channel naturalization, rehabilitation, and
   restoration projects are inherently fraught with uncertainty. Although a
   systematic approach to design can be described, the likelihood of
   success or failure of the design is unknown due to uncertainties within
   the design and implementation process. In this paper, a method for
   incorporating uncertainty in decision-making during the design phase is
   presented that uses a decision analysis method known as Failure Modes
   and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The approach is applied to a channel
   rehabilitation project in north-central Pennsylvania. FMEA considers
   risk in terms of the likelihood of a component failure, the consequences
   of failure, and the level of difficulty required to detect failure.
   Ratings developed as part of the FMEA can provide justification for
   decision making in determining design components that require particular
   attention to prevent failure of the project and the appropriate
   compensating actions to be taken.}},

Abstract = {{Casa del Agua (Casa) in suburban Tucson, Arizona, was designed as a
   residential water conservation facility for applied research,
   demonstration of operational results, and transfer of technology to the
   general public. Starting in 1983, an existing residence was located,
   modified and retrofitted to acquire operational data on residential
   water use. Modifications included retrofitting existing landscapes and
   enlarging the rooftop to collect and harvest rainwater; separating
   blackwater and graywater lines; installing meters, low-water-use
   appliances and fixtures, and underground storage tanks for rainwater and
   graywater; and creating a public information center. Over the 13-plus
   years of actual operation, both the interior and exterior water use
   research results indicate large reductions in water use can be effected
   using water-saving devices and/or harvesting and reusing rainwater and
   graywater. Casa achieved over a 24 percent reduction in total water use
   and a 47 percent reduction in municipal water used compared to the
   typical Tucson residence. Overall water used was comprised of harvested
   rainwater (10 percent), recycled graywater (20 percent), and municipal
   water (70 percent). Casa's Information Center was visited by
   approximately 13,000 people from September 1985 through April 1999 and
   the research has been featured in local, national, and international
   media.}},

Abstract = {{The model bankfull discharge recurrence interval (annual series) (T-a)
   in streams has been approximated at a 1.5-year flow event. This study
   tests the linkage between regional factors (climate, physiography, and
   ecoregion) and the frequency of bankfull discharge events in the Pacific
   Northwest (PNW). Patterns of Ta were found to be significant when
   stratified by EPA Ecoregion. The mean value for T-a in the PNW is 1.4
   years; however, when the data is stratified by ecoregion, the humid
   areas of western Oregon and Washington have a mean value of 1.2 years,
   while the dryer areas of Idaho and eastern Oregon and Washington have a
   mean value of 1.4 to 1.5 years. Among the four factors evaluated,
   vegetation association and average annual precipitation are the primary
   factors related to channel form and T-a. Based on the results of the Ta
   analyses, regional hydraulic geometry relationships of streams were
   developed for the PNW, which relate variables, such as bankfull
   cross-sectional area, width, depth, and velocity, to bankfull discharge
   and drainage area. The verification of Ta values, combined with the
   development of regional hydraulic geometry relationships, provides
   geographically relevant information that will result in more accurate
   estimates of hydraulic geometry variables in the PNW.}},

Abstract = {{The flood hydroclimatology of the Grand Forks flood of April 1997, the
   most costly flood on a per capita basis for a major metropolitan area in
   United States history, is analyzed in terms of the natural processes
   that control spring snowmelt flooding in the region. The
   geomorphological characteristics of the basin are reviewed, and an
   integrated assessment of the hydroclimatological conditions during the
   winter of 1996 to 1997 is presented to gain a real-world understanding
   of the physical basis of this catastrophic flood event. The Grand Forks
   flood resulted from the principal flood-producing factors occurring at
   either historic or extreme levels, or at levels conducive to severe
   flooding. Above normal fall precipitation increased the fall soil
   moisture storage and reduced the spring soil moisture storage potential.
   A concrete frost layer developed that effectively reduced the soil
   infiltration capacity to zero. Record snowfall totals and snow cover
   depths occurred across the basin because of the unusual persistence of a
   blocking high circulation pattern throughout the winter. A severe, late
   spring blizzard delayed the snowmelt season and replenished the snow
   cover to record levels for early April. This blizzard was followed by a
   sudden transition to an extreme late season thaw due to the abrupt
   breakdown of the blocking circulation pattern. The presence of river ice
   contributed to backwater effects and affected the timing of tributary
   inflows to the main stem of the Red River. Only the absence of spring
   rains prevented an even more catastrophic flood disaster from taking
   place, This paper contributes to our understanding of the flood
   hydroclimatology of catastrophic flood events in an unusual flood hazard
   region that possesses relatively flat terrain, a north-flowing river,
   and an annual peak discharge time series dominated by spring snowmelt
   floods.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to examine a deficit in water for the
   Hsinchu area, the location of Taiwan's ``Silicon Valley.{''} The methods
   suggested in this paper to diagnose water shortage problems are simple
   and practical. The results show that Hsinchu is in an area without
   sufficient water to meet demand for domestic and industrial uses. Until
   the completion of the Baoshan II Reservoir in 2006, the most feasible
   options for the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation to offset the water
   deficiency in Hsinchu City over the next five years are: (a) to obtain
   water gratuitously from the southern Yungheshan Reservoir; (b) to import
   additional water at an extra charge from other sources such as the
   northern Shihmen Reservoir and the agricultural sector; and (c) to
   conduct a comprehensive water conservation program at the Hsinchu
   Science-based Industrial Park.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of a point source (PS) input on water chemistry
   and nutrient retention in Spavinaw Creek, Arkansas, during summer
   baseflows in 1998 and 1999. The nutrient uptake length (S-W) concept was
   used to quantify the impact of nutrient inputs in the receiving stream.
   We used an artificial injection upstream of the PS inputs to estimate
   background Sw and used the natural decline in nutrient concentrations
   below the PS to estimate the net nutrient uptake length (S-net). S-W for
   soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the upstream reference section was
   0.75 km, but S-net ranged from 9.0 to 31 km for SRP and 3.1 to 12 kin
   for NO3-N in the reach below the PS. S-net-SRP was significantly
   correlated with discharge whereas S-net-NO3-N was correlated with the
   amount of NO3-N enrichment from the PS. In order to examine specific
   mechanisms of P retention, loosely exchangeable P and P Sorption Index
   (PSI) of stream sediments were measured. Sediments exhibited little
   natural P buffering capacity (low PSI) above the PS, but P loading from
   the PS further reduced PSI. Loosely exchangeable P in the sediments also
   increased three fold below the PS, indicating sediments removed some
   water column P. The physical process of flow and sediment sorption
   apparently regulated P retention in Spavinaw Creek, whereas the level of
   N enrichment and possibly biotic uptake and denitrification influenced N
   retention. Regardless of the mechanism, Spavinaw Creek demonstrated
   little ability to retain PS-added nutrients because net nutrient uptake
   lengths were in the kin range.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a system approach to water resources development in
   Tehran Metropolitan Area, with its complex system of water supply and
   demands, is discussed. Water resources in this region include water
   storage in the Lar, Latyan, and Karaj reservoirs, the Tehran aquifer, as
   well as water discharge in local rivers and in drainage channels (mainly
   supplied by urban runoff and wastewater). This study consists of three
   phases of long-term water resources planning and management in the
   Tehran metropolitan area. In each phase, a different level of details
   among different components of the system is considered. In the first
   phase, optimal operating policies for Tehran reservoirs and a decision
   support system are developed. In the second phase, interactions between
   surface and ground water resources as well as surface runoffs and
   wastewater disposal in different subareas are investigated. The water
   table fluctuations as a result of implementing sewerage collection
   project was also simulated. In the last phase, long-term scenarios for
   water resources and agricultural development in the Southern part of
   Tehran are defined, and the effects of each scenario on the quality and
   quantity of surface and ground water resources are studied.}},

Abstract = {{In and regions where populations are expanding and water is scarce,
   people are searching for ways to conserve and reuse water. One way
   homeowners can conserve water is by recycling graywater - wastewater
   from household sinks, showers, bathtubs, and washing machines. Graywater
   is used mostly for landscape irrigation. Since graywater is wastewater,
   reusing it raises concerns about disease transmission, either by contact
   with the water or the irrigated soil. The purpose of this study was to
   assess how factors such as number and age of household occupants, types
   of graywater storage, and sources of graywater used affect the microbial
   quality of graywater and soil irrigated with graywater. Samples were
   collected over twelve months from eleven Tucson, Arizona households
   recycling graywater. Samples of graywater, soil irrigated by graywater,
   and soil irrigated by potable water were collected. We found that
   graywater irrigation causes a statistically significant increase in
   levels of fecal coliforms in soil when compared to soil irrigated with
   potable water. Graywater from the kitchen sink significantly increases
   levels of these bacteria in water and soil. Children also cause a
   statistically significant increase in fecal coliform levels in graywater
   and soil, possibly introducing a small amount of additional risk in
   graywater reuse.}},

Abstract = {{Reservoir water quality is traditionally monitored and evaluated based
   on field data. Collecting and analyzing field water quality data are
   costly and time consuming tasks, and whether a limited number of field
   data truly characterize the spatial variation of the trophic state
   within a vast water body is often disputed. In this study we utilize
   Landsat TM data to estimate the water quality and trophic state of the
   Te-Chi reservoir in Central Taiwan. A modified multi-parameter model of
   Carlson's trophic state index (TSI) was developed for the Te-chi
   reservoir. Water quality parameters (concentration of chlorophyll-a,
   total phosphorous measurement, and secchi disk depth) required by the
   model are found to have high correlations with combinations of TM bands.
   Therefore, TM data are used to map the trophic state of the reservoir.
   TM-derived TSI maps of the reservoir reveal that, in summer, the trophic
   state in the reservoir generally improves from upstream to downstream
   and that zones of distinct trophic state exist. Atrophic state index
   based on secchi disk depth may give erroneous values in the upstream
   section of the reservoir pool due to high sediment concentration in the
   reservoir inflow. We conclude that the Te-Chi reservoir is eutrophic or
   worse in summer and meso-eutrophic in winter. Implementation of best
   management practices to reduce nonpoint source pollution in the upstream
   watershed is highly recommended. This study demonstrates the capability
   of mapping the trophic state in impounded water bodies using the Landsat
   TM data.}},

Abstract = {{When the goal of water pricing is elevated from mere cost recovery to
   deriving the greatest value from scarce water and associated nonwater

   address the challenge of creating rates that, are both efficient and

   rate-making are considered. Purposeful selection of rate parameters for
   a specific billing system is demonstrated to serve efficiency and cost
   recovery objectives. Attention to non-accounting opportunity costs is an
   important system element, but these costs are often not fully borne by
   the utility or its customers. In situations where this issue is serious,

Abstract = {{Regression models were developed for estimating stream concentrations of
   the herbicides alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine, metolachlor, and
   trifluralin from use-intensity data and watershed characteristics.
   Concentrations were determined from samples collected from 45 streams
   throughout the United States during 1993 to 1995 as part of the U.S.
   Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA). Separate
   regression models were developed for each of six percentiles (10th,
   25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th) of the annual distribution of stream
   concentrations and for the annual time-weighted mean concentration.
   Estimates for the individual percentiles can be combined to provide an
   estimate of the annual distribution of concentrations for a given
   stream. Agricultural use of the herbicide in the watershed was a
   significant predictor in nearly all of the models. Several hydrologic
   and soil parameters also were useful in explaining the variability in
   concentrations of herbicides among the streams. Most of the regression
   models developed for estimation of concentration percentiles and annual
   mean concentrations accounted for 50 percent to 90 percent of the
   variability among streams. Predicted concentrations were nearly always
   within an order of magnitude of the measured concentrations for the
   model-development streams, and predicted concentration distributions
   reasonably matched the actual distributions in most cases. Results from
   application of the models to streams not included in the model
   development data set are encouraging, but further validation of the
   regression approach described in this paper is needed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the co-evolution of the Las Vegas, Nevada
   metropolitan area, Las Vegas Wash ecosystem - a downstream riparian
   wetland - and Wash management as a case of urban-environment dynamics.
   Since Las Vegas Wash provides the primary drainage for Las Vegas,
   changes in the urban system lead to changes in the Wash and its
   ecosystem. The population of the drainage area has grown from
   approximately 1,000 people in 1900 to more than 1.3 million in 2000.
   This phenomenal population growth led to increased Wash flow, from less
   than .03 m(3)/sec (1 ft(3)/sec) to over 7.4 m(3)/sec (260 ft(3)/sec),
   and consequent ecological changes from a nearly dry wash to a rich
   wetland, and now to an eroded system. As the Wash ecosystem changed,
   valuation of Wash characteristics by residents and resource managers
   also changed, shifting the focus of management and use, which ultimately
   led to further ecosystem changes. Reciprocal relationships among human
   activity, environmental change, and management in this urban area
   highlight the need for a comprehensive and dynamic systems perspective
   and adaptive approaches in urban environmental management and make this
   a particularly compelling case study. This paper describes a conceptual
   systems framework for adaptive urban-environment management derived from
   this case.}},

   reservoir flood control operation is quickly generating some feasible

   the weight and relative membership degree are directly acquired from the
   recommended alternatives provided by decision makers, the results are
   more reasonable and realistic. Besides, the difficulty in giving weights
   is also avoided. With the aid of a robust and flexible decision support

Abstract = {{Closely located domestic and public supply wells were sampled using
   identical sampling procedures to allow comparison of water quality
   associated with well type. Water samples from 15 pairs of wells with
   similar screened intervals completed in the central High Plains regional
   aquifer in parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas were analyzed for more
   than 200 water quality constituents. No statistically significant
   differences were observed between the concentrations of
   naturally-derived constituents (major ions, trace elements, and radon)
   in paired wells. However, differences in water quality between paired
   wells were observed for selected anthropogenic compounds (pesticides and
   tritium), in that some public supply wells produced water that was more
   recently recharged and contained constituents derived from surface
   activities. The presence of recently recharged water and compounds
   indicative of anthropogenic activities in some public supply wells was
   likely due to operational variations (pumping rate and pumping cycles),
   as demonstrated in a particle tracking simulation. Water containing
   surface-derived anthropogenic compounds from near the water table was
   more quickly drawn to high volume public supply wells (less than five
   years) than domestic wells (greater than 120 years) with small pumping
   rates. These findings indicate that water quality samples collected from
   different well types in the same area are not necessarily directly
   comparable. Sampling domestic wells provides the best broad-scale
   assessment of water quality in this aquifer setting because they are
   less susceptible to localized contamination from near the water table.
   However, sampling public supply wells better represents the quality of
   the used resource because of the population served.}},

Abstract = {{A vertical (laterally integrated) two-dimensional numerical model has
   been applied to study the hydrodynamic characteristics and salt water
   intrusion in the Tanshui River estuarine system. The cross-sectional
   profiles measured in 1978 and 1994 are schematized for model
   simulations. Detailed model calibration and verification have been
   conducted with water surface elevations, tidal current, salinity
   distributions, and residual velocities measured. The overall performance
   of the model is in qualitative agreement with the available field data.
   The model was then used to study how hydrodynamics and salt water
   intrusion change in response to changes in bathymetry. The model
   simulations indicate that more tidal energy propagates into the
   estuarine system in 1994 because of the substantial increase in river
   cross-sections. The limits of salt intrusion in 1994 extended farther
   inland than those in 1978. On the other hand, the extent of mangrove
   wetland in the lower estuary has increased over the past 20 years and is
   likely a result of the increased salinity in the estuary.}},

Abstract = {{We propose that some watersheds may be better candidates for watershed
   management than others. The extent of success of watershed management
   may depend, in part, on attributes intrinsic to watersheds: scientific
   feasibility, social feasibility, and motivational feasibility. Using
   illustrations from New Jersey watershed management efforts, we tie
   scientific feasibility to the nature of environmental problems and the
   scientific capability to solve them. Social feasibility encompasses
   civic infrastructure and engagement. Motivational feasibility includes
   issue salience linked to values or economic considerations. We suggest
   that assessments should be made about the viability of watershed
   management in specific watersheds and that priorities should be
   developed based on these assessments. Research on watershed management
   should explore not only how to improve watershed management but also
   where to conduct it.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to characterize the sources,
   concentrations, and distribution of total and methylmercury in water,
   and channel and bank sediments of Steamboat Creek, Nevada. This
   information was needed to begin to assess the potential impacts of
   stream restoration on mercury pollution in this tributary to the Truckee
   River. The Truckee River flows into Pyramid Lake, a terminal water body
   home to one endangered and one threatened fish species, where stable
   pollutants will accumulate over time. Mercury in Steamboat Creek was
   originally derived from its headwaters, Washoe Lake, where several gold
   and silver mills that utilized mercury were located. In the 100 plus
   years since ore processing occurred, mercury-laden alluvium has been
   deposited in the stream channel and on streambanks where it is available
   for remobilization. Total mercury concentrations measured in unfiltered
   water from the creek ranged from 82 to 419 ng/L, with greater than 90
   percent of this mercury being particle-bound (> 0.45 (m). Mercury in
   sediments ranged from 0.26 to 10.2 mug/g. Methylmercury concentrations
   in sediments of Steamboat Creek were highest in wetlands, lower in the
   stream channel, and still lower in streambank settings. Methylmercury
   concentrations in water were 0.63 to 1.4 ng/L. A streambank restoration
   plan, which includes alterations to channel geometry and wetland
   creation or expansion, has been initiated for the creek. Data developed
   indicate that streambank stabilization could reduce the mercury loading
   to the Creek and that wetland construction could exacerbate
   methylmercury production.}},

Abstract = {{Many water bodies within the United States are contaminated by non-point
   source (NIPS) pollution, which is defined as those materials posing a
   threat to water quality arising from a number of individual sources and
   diffused through hydrologic processes. One such NPS pollutant that is of
   critical concern are pathogens derived from animal wastes, including
   humans. The potential presence of pathogens is identified by testing the
   water for fecal coliform, a bacteria also associated with animal wastes.
   Water contaminated by animal wastes are most often associated with urban
   and agricultural areas, thus it is postulated that by utilizing land
   cover indicators, those water bodies that may be at risk of fecal
   coliform contamination may be identified. This study utilizes land cover
   information derived from the Multi-Resolution Land Characterization
   (MRLC) project to analyze fecal coliform contamination in South
   Carolina. Also utilized are 14 digit hydrologic unit code (HUC)
   watersheds of the state, a digital elevation model, and test point data
   stating whether fecal coliform. levels exceeded State Water Quality
   Standards. Proportions of the various land covers are identified within
   the individual watersheds and then analyzed using a logistic regression.
   The results reveal that watersheds with large proportions of urban land
   cover and agriculture on steep slopes had a very high probability of
   being impaired.}},

Abstract = {{An informal sample of 30 flawed monitoring projects was examined to
   identify the most common problems and to determine how they could have
   been prevented. Problems fall into two, general categories: 70 percent
   of the sampled projects had design problems, and 50 percent of the
   sampled projects had procedural problems. Monitoring projects
   implemented by land-management agencies tended to have a higher
   proportion of procedural problems than did university-based programs
   (generally graduate student research), while the frequency of design
   problems was similar between agencies and universities. The most common
   problems were poorly trained or unmotivated field crews (37 percent of
   projects, a procedural problem), a sampling plan that was not capable of
   measuring what was needed to meet project objectives (30 percent,
   design), delays in analyzing data (27 percent, procedure), inadequate
   monitoring durations (27 percent, design), and absence of the collateral
   information needed to interpret results (20 percent, procedure). Most of
   the problems could have been avoided by submission of the study design
   to thorough technical and statistical review, active participation of
   the principal investigators in field data collection, and analysis of at
   least some of the data as soon as information was collected so that
   problems could be recognized early enough to be corrected.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{821-835}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We formally evaluated the relationship between landscape characteristics
   and surface water quality in the state of Pennsylvania (USA) by
   regressing two different types of pollutant responses on landscape
   variables that were measured for whole watersheds. One response was the
   monthly exported mass of nitrogen estimated from field measurements,
   while the other response was a GIS-modeled pollution potential index.
   Regression models were built by the stepwise selection protocol,
   choosing an optimal set of landscape predictors. After factoring out the
   effect of physiography, the dominant predictors were the proportion of
   ``annual herbaceous{''} land and ``total herbaceous{''} land for the
   nitrogen loading and pollution potential index, respectively. The
   strength of these single predictors is encouraging because the marginal
   land cover proportions are the simplest landscape measurements to obtain
   once a land cover map is in hand; however, the optimal set of predictors
   also included several measurements of spatial pattern. Thus, for
   watersheds at this general hierarchical scale, gross landscape pattern
   may be an important influence on instream pollution loading. Overall,
   there is strong evidence that using landscape measurements alone,
   obtained solely from remotely sensed data, can explain most of the water
   quality variability (R-2 approximate to approx. 0.75) within these
   watersheds.}},

   thus allowing generation of a non-dominated curve. The effect of
   imperfect forecast on the performance of the real-time operation model
   is also evaluated. An application is made to a subsystem of the
   Brazilian hydroelectric system, located in the Paranapanema river basin.

Abstract = {{Review of recent literature indicates an emergence in the use of
   combinatorial methods such as simulated annealing in ground water
   management during the past nine to ten years. While previous studies
   demonstrated the feasibility of using these methods, a general finding
   was that computational processing requirements were inordinately high
   relative to gradient-based methods. An enhanced annealing algorithm was
   developed and used to demonstrate the potential for greatly improving
   the computational efficiency of simulated annealing as an optimization
   method for ground water management applications. The algorithm
   incorporates ``directional search{''} and ``memory{''} capabilities.
   Selecting search directions based on better understanding of the current
   neighborhood of the configuration space was shown to improve algorithm
   performance. Also, ``memory{''} concepts derived from the Tabu Search
   Method show particular promise for improving the rate and quality of
   convergence, Performance of the enhanced annealing method was evaluated
   and the resultant management method was demonstrated using an example
   from the literature.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for ground water remediation design has been developed
   that interfaces ground water simulation models with an enhanced
   annealing optimizer. The ground water flow and transport simulators
   provide the ability to consider site-specific contamination and
   geohydrologic conditions directly in the assessment of alternative
   remediation system designs. The optimizer facilitates analysis of
   tradeoffs between technical, environmental, regulatory, and financial
   risks for alternative design and operation scenarios. A ground water
   management model using an optimization method referred to as ``enhanced
   annealing{''} (simulated annealing enhanced to include ``directional
   search{''} and ``memory{''} mechanisms) has been developed and
   successfully applied to an actual restoration problem. The demonstration
   site is the contaminated unconfined aquifer referred to as N-Springs
   located at Hanford, Washington. Results of the demonstration show the
   potential for improving groundwater restoration system performance while
   reducing overall system cost.}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{877-885}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The reliable sizing of reservoirs is a very important task of hydraulic
   engineering. Although many reservoirs throughout the world have been
   designed using Rippl's mass curves with historical inflow volumes at the
   dam site, this technique is now considered outdated. In this paper,
   synthetic series of monthly inflows are used as an alternative to
   historical inflow records. These synthetic series are generated from
   stochastic SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
   models. The analyzed data refer to the planned Almopeos Reservoir on the
   Almopeos River in Northern Greece with 19-year monthly inflow series.
   The analysis of this study demonstrates the ability of SARIMA models, in
   conjunction with the adequate transformation, to forecast monthly
   inflows of one or more months ahead and generate synthetic series of
   monthly inflows that preserve the key statistics of the historical
   monthly inflows and their persistence Hurst coefficient K. The
   forecasted monthly inflows would be of help in evaluating the optimal
   real time reservoir operation policies and the generated synthetic
   series of monthly inflows can be used to provide a probabilistic
   framework for reservoir design and to cope with the situation where the
   design horizon of interest exceeds the length of the historical inflow
   record.}},

Abstract = {{In the last 30 years, the National Resource Conservation Service's TR-55
   and TR-20 models have seen a dramatic increase in use for stormwater
   management purposes. This paper reviews some of the data that were
   originally used to develop these models and tests how well the models
   estimate annual series peak runoff rates for the same watersheds using
   longer historical data record lengths. The paper also explores
   differences between TR-55 and TR-20 peak runoff rate estimates and time
   of concentration methods. It was found that of the 37 watersheds tested,
   25 were either over- or under-pre dieting the actual historical
   watershed runoff rates by more than 30 percent. The results of this
   study indicate that these NRCS models should not be used to model small
   wooded watersheds less than 20 acres. This would be especially true if
   the watershed consisted of an area without a clearly defined outlet
   channel. This study also supports the need for regulators to allow
   educated hydrologists to alter pre-packaged model parameters or results
   more easily than is currently permitted.}},

Abstract = {{Water management agencies seek the next generation of modeling tools for
   planning and operating river basins. Previous site-specific models such
   as U,S. Bureau of Reclamation's (USBR) Colorado River Simulation System
   and Tennessee Valley Authority's (TVA) Daily Scheduling Model have
   become obsolete; however, new models are difficult and expensive to
   develop and maintain. Previous generalized river basin modeling tools
   are limited in their ability to represent diverse physical system and
   operating policy details for a wide range of applications. RiverWard
   (TM), a new generalized river basin modeling tool, provides a
   construction kit for developing and running detailed, site-specific
   models without the need to develop or maintain the supporting software
   within the water management agency. It includes an extensible library of
   modeling algorithms, several solvers, and a rich ``language{''} for the
   expression of operating policy. Its point-and-click graphical interface
   facilitates model construction and execution, and communication of
   policies, assumptions and results to others. Applications developed and
   used by the TVA and the USBR demonstrate that a wide range of
   operational and planning problems on widely varying basins can be solved
   using this tool.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to investigate the sensitivity of a
   hydrologic models to the type of DEM used. This was done while modeling
   basin water quality with 1:24,000 and 1:250,000 U.S. Geological Survey
   DEMs as input to model hydrological processes. The manner in which the
   model results were sensitive to the choice of raster cell size (scale)
   is investigated in this study. The Broadhead watershed, located in New
   Jersey, USA, was chosen as a study area. Curve numbers were estimated by
   a trial and error to match simulated and observed total discharge.
   Monthly runoff for the watershed was used in the calibration process.
   Higher runoff volumes were simulated by the model when the 1:24,000 DEM
   were used as input data, probably due to the finer resolution which
   simulated increased average slope and hence higher estimated runoff from
   the watershed. As the simulated slope of the watershed is flatten with
   the 1:250,000 DEM, the response of stream flow was delayed and simulated
   less runoff volume.}},

Abstract = {{The model described herein was used to assess effects of the Suwannee
   River sill (a low earthen dam constructed to impound the Suwannee River
   within the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge to eliminate wildfires)
   on the hydrologic environment of Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia. Developed
   with Are/Info Macro Language routines in the GRID environment, the model
   distributes water in the swamp landscape using precipitation, inflow,
   evapotranspiration, outflow, and standing water. Water movement
   direction and rate are determined by the neighborhood topographic
   gradient, determined using survey grade Global Positioning Systems
   technology. Model data include flow rates from USGS monitored gauges,
   precipitation volumes and water levels measured within the swamp, and
   estimated evapotranspiration volumes spatially modified by vegetation
   type. Model output in semi-monthly time steps includes water depth,
   water surface elevation above mean sea level, and movement direction and
   volume. Model simulations indicate the sill impoundment affects 18
   percent of the swamp during high water conditions when wildfires are
   scarce and has minimal spatial effect (increasing hydroperiods in less
   than 5 percent of the swamp) during low water and drought conditions
   when fire occurrence is high but precipitation and inflow volumes are
   limited.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing availability of digital and remotely sensed data
   such as land use, soil texture, and digital elevation models (DEMs),
   geographic information systems (GIS) have become an indispensable tool
   in preprocessing data sets for watershed hydrologic modeling and post
   processing simulation results. However, model inputs and outputs must be
   transferred between the model and the GIS. These transfers can be
   greatly simplified by incorporating the model itself into the GIS
   environment. To this end, a simple hydrologic model, which incorporates
   the curve number method of rainfall-runoff partitioning, the
   ground-water baseflow routine, and the Muskingum flow routing procedure,
   was implemented on the GIS. The model interfaces directly with stream
   network, flow direction, and watershed boundary data generated using
   standard GIS terrain analysis tools; and while the model is running,
   various data layers may be viewed at each time step using the full
   display capabilities. The terrain analysis tools were first used to
   delineate the drainage basins and stream networks for the Susquehanna
   River. Then the model was used to simulate the hydrologic response of
   the Upper West Branch of the Susquehanna to two different storms. The
   simulated streamflow hydrographs compare well with the observed
   hydrographs at the basin outlet.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses the potential impact of climate change on stream
   flow and nutrient loading in six watersheds of the Susquehanna River
   Basin using the Generalized Watershed Loading Function (GWLF). The model
   was used to simulate changes in stream flow and nutrient loads under a
   transient climate change scenario for each watershed. Under an
   assumption of no change in land cover and land management, the model was
   used to predict monthly changes in stream flow and nutrient loads for
   future climate conditions. Mean annual stream flow and nutrient loads
   increased for most watersheds, but decreased in one watershed that was
   intensively cultivated. Nutrient loading slightly decreased in April and
   late summer for several watersheds as a result of early snowmelt and
   increasing evapotranspiration. Spatial and temporal variability of
   stream flow and nutrient loads under the transient climate scenario
   indicates that different approaches for future water resource management
   may be useful.}},

Abstract = {{An index of watershed susceptibility to surface water contamination by
   herbicides could be used to improve source water assessments for public
   drinking water supplies, prioritize watershed restoration projects, and
   direct funding and educational efforts to areas where the greatest
   environmental benefit can be realized. The goal of this study is to use
   streamflow and herbicide concentration data to develop and evaluate a
   method for estimating comparative watershed susceptibility to herbicide
   loss. United States Geological Survey (USGS) concentration data for five
   relatively water soluble herbicides (alachlor, atrazine, cyanazine,
   metolachlor, and simazine) were analyzed for 16 Indiana watersheds.
   Correlation was assessed between observed herbicide losses and: (1) a
   herbicide runoff index using GIS-based land use, soil type, SCS runoff
   curve number, tillage practice, herbicide use estimates, and
   combinations of these factors; and (2) predicted herbicide losses from a
   non-point source pollution model (NAPRA-Web, an Internet-based interface
   for GLEAMS). The highest adjusted R-2 value was found between herbicide
   concentration and the runoff curve number alone, ranging from 0.25 to
   0.56. Predictions from the simulation model showed a poorer correlation
   with observed herbicide loss. This indicates potential for using the
   runoff curve number as a simple herbicide contamination susceptibility
   index.}},

Abstract = {{Improved sampling techniques are needed to increase the accuracy of
   pebble-count particle-size distributions used for stream studies in
   gravel-bed streams. However, pebble counts are prone to operator errors
   introduced through subjective particle selection, serial correlation,
   and inaccurate particle-size measurements. Errors in particle-size
   measurements can be minimized by using a gravel template. Operator
   influence on particle selection can be minimized by using a sampling
   frame, 60 by 60 cm, in which sampling points are identified by the cross
   points of thin elastic bands. Serial correlation can be minimized by
   adjusting the spacing between the cross points and setting it equal to
   the dominant large particle size (approximate toD(95)). In a field test
   in a cobble-bed stream, the sampling frame developed in this study
   produced slightly coarser size distributions, particularly in the cobble
   range, than the traditional heel-to-toe walk that selects particles with
   a blind touch at the tip of the boot. The sampling frame produced more
   similar sampling results between two operators than heel-to-toe walks.
   The difference between the two sampling methods is attributed to an
   unbiased selection of fine and coarse particles when using the sampling
   frame.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this investigation was to determine the effect of
   sampling frequency and sampling type on estimates of monthly nutrient
   loads and flow-weighted nutrient concentrations in a constructed
   wetland. Phosphorus and nitrogen loads and concentrations entering and
   leaving a subtropical wetland (the Everglades Nutrient Removal Project,
   ENRP) were calculated on the basis of three sampling frequencies. The
   first frequency included weekly composite samples (three daily samples
   composited for one week) and grab samples from August 1994 to July 1997,
   representing a base-line condition for comparison with results using
   reduced sampling frequencies. The second and third sampling frequency
   included three and two composite samples per month, respectively, drawn
   from the weekly samples. Total phosphorus and nitrogen loads calculated
   using two and three samples per month were almost identical to results
   based on four samples per month (least-squares regression coefficients
   ranged from 0.96 to 0.98). Results of monthly mean flow-weighted
   nutrient concentrations, obtained using reduced sampling frequencies,
   also were strongly correlated to concentrations calculated using the
   base-line sampling frequency (r(2) ranged from 0.82 to 0.93). Grab
   samples did not always provide good estimates of loads or
   concentrations, particularly at the inflow when data were highly
   variable. From the results of this study, we can recommend that
   bi-weekly composite sampling be used to Monitor nutrient concentrations
   and loads discharged from larger-scale Everglades Stormwater Treatment
   Areas (STAs) now under construction. Because there are high costs
   associated with water sample collection and processing, studies to
   identify optimal sampling frequencies should be a key feature in the
   design of any comprehensive wetland-monitoring program.}},

Abstract = {{A time series of annual flow of the Sacramento River, California, is
   reconstructed to A.D. 869 from tree rings for a longterm perspective on
   hydrologic drought. Reconstructions derived by principal components
   regression of flow on time-varying subsets of tree-ring chronologies
   account for 64 to 81 percent of the flow variance in the 1906 to 1977
   calibration period. A Monte Carlo analysis of reconstructed n-year
   running means indicates that the gaged record contains examples of
   drought extremes for averaging periods of perhaps = 6 to 10 years, but
   not for longer and shorter averaging periods. For example, the estimated
   probability approaches 1.0 that the flow in A.D. 1580 was lower than the
   lowest single-year gaged flow. The tree-ring record also suggests that
   persistently high or low flows over 50-year periods characterize some
   parts of the long-term flow history. The results should contribute to
   sensible water resources planning for the Sacramento Basin and to the
   methodology of incorporating tree-ring data in the assessment of the
   probability of hydrologic drought.}},

Abstract = {{A 2xCO2 climate and runoff in the Upper Deschutes Basin in central
   Oregon is simulated using a mesoscale atmospheric model and a watershed
   model that incorporates spatial variability of the runoff process. A
   nine-year control climate monthly time series provides a benchmark for
   assessing changes related to a warmer and wetter 2xCO2 climate.
   Potential evapotranspiration is increased by 23 percent and snow water
   equivalent is reduced by 59 percent in the 2xCO2 climate. Annual runoff
   increases by 23 percent, while November runoff increases by 55 percent.
   The average maximum monthly runoff is in May for both the control
   climate and 2xCO2 climate, but in five of the nine years the monthly
   maximum runoff for the 2xCO2 climate occurs two to five months earlier
   than for the control climate. The minimum runoff month is one to five
   months earlier in the 2xCO2 climate in seven of the nine years, and the
   month of average minimum runoff is March in the control climate and
   November in the 2xCO2 climate. Since precipitation is greatest in
   December in both the control climate and 2xCO2 climate, the earlier
   maximum and minimum runoff for a 2xCO2 climate indicates greater
   watershed sensitivity to temperature than to precipitation.}},

Abstract = {{In the Green Mountain state of Vermont, droughts of one form or another
   and of varying intensities, severities, and areal extent are not
   uncommon occurrences. The 1990s were marked by at least three drought
   events of which the 1998 to 1999 was the most recent. In spite of this
   recurrence, ongoing drought monitoring and mitigative planning efforts
   are not as advanced as they could be and no official drought plan exists
   for the state. This article is the first of two in this volume. It
   summarizes the cascade of drought types that impacted the state during
   the 1998 to 1999 episode. From a number of precipitation statistics and
   drought indices, fine spatial scales (county or better) were found to
   best capture the character of drought impacts, while the weekly time
   step is recommended as the temporal unit around which to base planning
   and monitoring efforts. The companion article outlines a possible
   framework for drought planning efforts and highlights key constituencies
   to be included in the process.}},

Abstract = {{A new screening approach is applied to a large-scale multiple criteria
   water management problem to remove actions that cannot possibly be in
   the best subset. An inherent advantage of the approach is its ability to
   identify inferior actions by examining them individually, rather than
   within subsets. In a case study involving the selection of actions to
   address high water levels in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Basin, two
   statistical indicators, the mode and the mean, are used to aggregate the
   opinions of experts and representatives of interest groups on the
   impacts of actions according to various criteria. Application of the
   screening approach shows that some of the proposed actions can be
   removed as they can never be in the optimal subset, thereby reducing the
   size of the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Granular matrix soil moisture sensors were used to control urban
   landscape irrigation in Boulder, Colorado, during 1997. The purpose of
   the study was to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the
   technology for water conservation. The 23 test sites included a traffic
   median, a small city park, and 21 residential sites. The results were
   very good. The system limited actual applications to an average of 73
   percent of the theoretical requirement. This resulted in an average
   saving of \$331 per installed sensor. The sensors were highly reliable.
   All 23 sensors were placed in service at least three years prior to the
   1997 study during earlier studies. Of these, only two had failed by the
   beginning of the 1997 study, both due to external factors. Including
   replacement of these failed sensors, the total repair cost for the 1997
   irrigation season was less than \$270. The effort required to maintain
   each system was small, only about 6-7 minutes per visit. Each site was
   visited weekly for this study, but less frequent visits could be made in
   practice. The sensors observed in this study performed well,
   significantly reduced water consumption, and were easy to monitor and
   maintain. Soil moisture sensors appear to be a useful and economical
   tool for urban water conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Water resource planning is based primarily on 20th century instrumental
   records of climate and streamflow. These records are limited in length
   to approximately 100 years, in the best cases, and can reflect only a
   portion of the range of natural variability. The instrumental record
   neither can be used to gage the unusualness of 20th Century extreme low
   flow events, nor does it allow the detection of low-frequency
   variability that may underlie short-term variations in flow. In this
   study, tree rings are used to reconstruct mean annual streamflow for
   Middle Boulder Creek in the Colorado Front Range, a semi-arid region of
   rapid growth and development. The reconstruction is based on a stepwise
   regression equation that accounts for 70 percent of the variance in the
   instrumental record, and extends from 1703-1987. The reconstruction
   suggests that the instrumental record of streamflow for Middle Boulder
   Creek is not representative of flow in past centuries and that several
   low flow events in the 19th century were more persistent than any in the
   20th century. The 1840s to early 1850s period of low flow is a
   particularly notable event and may have coincided with a period of low
   flow in the Upper Colorado River Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Watersheds above the Miyun reservoir, a principal source of surface
   water for Beijing, are designated to be managed for water production,
   but under the principle of multiple use. Because of the scarcity of
   arable land, these watersheds cannot be managed only for drinking water.
   Efforts are under way to reduce sediment delivery, improve the quality
   of water entering Miyun reservoir, and improve the welfare of watershed
   inhabitants. An economic appraisal of a watershed management project for
   the 3,298-ha Shixia watershed above the Miyun reservoir, indicates a 24
   percent economic rate of return on the investment made in the project.
   The net present value (NPV) of the project, calculated at a discount
   rate of 10 percent, is approximately US\$3.49 million. Sensitivity
   analyses indicate that a doubling of labor costs lowers the NPV to
   US\$2.07 million and a 10 percent decrease in benefits lowered the NPV
   to US\$2.87. It is concluded that the implementation of conservation
   practices on the Shixia Demonstration Watershed represent an
   economically efficient use of resources.}},

Abstract = {{The hedonic valuation method was used to quantify the impact of
   floodplain location on housing values in Fargo-Moorhead. Being located
   in the 100-year floodplain lowered the home values by \$8,990, and such
   homes were worth \$10,241 less than similar homes located outside the
   floodplain before the major flood event of 1997. Required flood
   insurance premiums for these homes were determined to account for
   approximately 81 percent of this price depreciation. In contrast, homes
   in the 500-year floodplain were worth \$3,100 more than similar homes
   not in the floodplain. It was concluded that more disclosure is needed
   regarding the location of the 500-year floodplain, and that the hedonic

Abstract = {{Long-term freshwater transport is an important factor affecting
   estuarine aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a primitive equation,
   prognostic, three-dimensional, hydrodynamic model was applied to
   Apalachicola Bay, Florida, for the summer and fall seasons of 1993. In
   response to the river freshwater discharge, tide, and wind forces, the
   model simulations were used to characterize the long-term freshwater
   transport processes in the bay. Analysis of spatial distributions of
   seasonal average salinity and currents shows that the long-term
   freshwater transport was strongly affected by the forcing functions of
   wind and density gradient in the bay. Average freshwater input was
   approximately the same in the summer and fall seasons of 1993. However,
   in the summer season, more freshwater moved to the east direction due to
   the predominant wind from the west, while in the fall season more
   freshwater moved to the west in response to the wind primarily from the
   east. The water column was strongly stratified near the river mouth, and
   it gradually changed to well mixing near the ocean boundaries. Vertical
   stratification in the bay changed due to wind-induced mixing and mass
   transport. Due to the density gradient effect, surface residual currents
   carrying fresher water were in the direction from the river toward the
   Gulf, while the bottom residual currents with saltier water entered the
   bay from the Gulf of Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff and sediment yield were collected from 100 plots during simulated
   rainfalls (100 mm/hr for 15 minutes) at antecedent soil moisture
   conditions. A clustering technique was used to stratify the variability
   of a single data set within a sagebrush-grass community into four groups
   based on vegetation life form and amount of cover. The four cluster
   groups were grass, grass/shrub, shrub, and forb/grass and were found to
   be significantly different in plant height, surface roughness, soil bulk
   density, and soil organic matter. Stepwise multiple regression analyses
   were performed on the single data set and each cluster group. Results
   for individual groups resulted in more robust predictive equations for
   runoff (r(2) = 0.65-0.73) and sediment yield (r(2) = 0.37-0.91) than for
   equations developed from the single data set (r(2) = 0.56 for runoff and
   r(2) = 0.27 for sediment yield). The standard errors of the cluster
   group regression equations were also improved in three of the four group
   equations for both runoff and sediment yield compared to the single data
   set. Runoff was found to be significantly less (p < 0.01) in the
   forb/grass group compared with other vegetation cluster groups, but this
   was influenced by four plots that produced Little or no runoff. Sediment
   yield was not found to be significantly different among any cluster
   groups. Discriminant analysis was then used to identify important
   variables and develop a model to classify plots into one of the four
   cluster groups. The discriminant model could be incorporated into
   rangeland hydrology and erosion models. The percentage cover of grasses,
   shrubs, litter, and bare ground effectively stratified about 12 percent
   of the variation observed in runoff and 26 percent of the variability
   for sediment yield as determined by r(2).}},

Title = {{Impact of a turfgrass system on nutrient loadings to surface water}},

Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{629-640}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Turfgrass systems are one of the most intensively managed land uses in
   the United States. Establishment and maintenance of high quality
   turfgrass usually implies substantial inputs of water, nutrients, and
   pesticides. The focus of this work was to quantify the concentration and
   loading of a typically maintained municipal turfgrass environment on
   surface water. Water quantity and quality data were collected from a
   golf course in Austin, Texas, and analyzed for a 13-month period from
   March 20, 1998, to April 30, 1999. Twenty-two precipitation events
   totaling 722 mm, produced an estimated 98 mm of runoff Nutrient analysis
   of surface runoff exiting the course exhibited a statistically
   significant (p < 0.05) increase in median nitrate plus nitrite nitrogen
   (NO3+NO2-N) concentration compared to runoff entering the course, a
   statistically significant decrease in ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N), but no
   difference in ortho-phosphate (PO4-P). During the 13-month period, storm
   runoff contributed an estimated 2.3 kg/ha of NO3+NO2-N and 0.33 kg/ha of
   PO4-P to the stream. Storm flow accounted for the attenuation of 0.12
   kg/ha of NH4-N. Baseflow nutrient analysis showed a statistically
   significant increase in median NO3+NO2-N, a significant reduction in
   NH4-N, and no change in PO4-P. Estimated NO3+NO2-N mass in the baseflow
   was calculated as 4.7 kg/ha. PO4-P losses were estimated at 0.06 kg/ha,
   while 0.8 kg/ha of NH4-N were attenuated in baseflow over the study
   period. Even though nutrient concentrations exiting the system rarely
   exceeded nutrient screening levels, this turfgrass environment did
   contribute increased NO3+NO2-N and PO4-P loads to the stream. This
   emphasizes the need for parallel studies where management intensity,
   soil, and climate differ from this study and for golf course managers to
   utilize an integrated management program to protect water quality while
   maintaining healthy turfgrass systems.}},

Abstract = {{Data collected from 121 stream reaches during 1991 to 1993 were
   evaluated to determine the applicability of the Rosgen Stream
   Classification System (RSCS) to the low relief terrain within the
   Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF) in Wisconsin, USA. All
   reaches were classified to RSCS Level I and II except that 10.7 percent
   had sinuosities below the continuum limits and one reach had a
   predominantly organic substrate. Five of eight possible RSCS Level I
   types were observed including B, C, D, A, E, and F; 86 percent were C
   and E types. Seventeen of 94 possible RSCS Level II types were observed.
   Most reaches were slightly entrenched, had low to moderate width/depth
   ratios, relatively low sinuosity, low slope, and sand or gravel as the
   dominant channel material. Discriminant analyses were used to verify the
   applicability of RSCS for streams within the CNNF; discriminant
   functions correctly classified 92.5 and 94.7 percent of the Level I and
   II RSCS types, respectively. When limits for E and F types were modified
   slightly at Level II by adding an additional category for slopes less
   than 0.1 percent (a modification we recommend for low relief terrain),
   discriminant functions correctly classified 99.1 percent-of the types.
   Adding another slope break at 0.3 percent produced similar results.
   Based on our analyses, RSCS works well, within the CNNF and is probably
   applicable to other areas with low-relief terrain.}},

Abstract = {{As part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), various
   water supply projects have been proposed in a region located between the
   Miami metropolitan area and the extensive regional wetland systems that
   are part of the Everglades or remnant Everglades. A ground water flow
   model of the surficial aquifer within northern Miami-Dade County was
   constructed using MODFLOW to evaluate the effects of these projects on
   water levels in the wetlands and the underlying surficial aquifer. The
   new Wetlands package was used to conjunctively simulate overland flow
   through these wetlands and the shallow ground water system. Comparisons
   of simulated to measured ground water levels and wetland stages were
   very satisfactory, where computed and measured water levels agreed
   within 0.5 ft over most of the period of record at nearly all of the
   monitoring sites. Temporal trends in water levels were also replicated.
   It was concluded that the assumptions and methodologies inherent to the
   Wetlands package were suitable for simulating regional wetland hydrology
   within the Everglades area.}},

Abstract = {{Operation of a storage-based reservoir modifies the downstream flow
   usually to a value higher than that of natural flow in dry season. This
   could be important for irrigation, water supply, or power production as
   it is like an additional downstream benefit without any additional
   investment. This study addresses the operation of two proposed
   reservoirs and the downstream flow augmentation at an irrigation project
   located at the outlet of the Gandaki River basin in Nepal. The optimal
   operating policies of the reservoirs were determined using a Stochastic
   Dynamic Programming (SDP) model considering the maximization of power
   production. The modified flows downstream of the reservoirs were
   simulated by a simulation model using the optimal operating policy (for
   power maximization) and a synthetic long-term inflow series. Comparing
   the existing flow (flow in river without reservoir operation) and the
   modified flow (flow after reservoir operation) at the irrigation
   project, the additional amount of flow was calculated. The reliability
   analysis indicated that the supply of irrigation could be increased by
   25 to 100 percent of the existing supply over the dry season (January to
   April) with a reliability of more than 80 percent.}},

Abstract = {{This study developed a QUAL2E-Reliability Analysis (QUAL2E-RA) model for
   the stochastic water quality analysis of the downstream reach of the
   main Han River in Korea. The proposed model is based on the QUAL2E model
   and incorporates the Advanced First-Order Second-Moment (AFOSM) and
   Mean-Value First-Order Second-Moment (MFOSM) methods. After the
   hydraulic characteristics from standard step method are identified, the
   optimal reaction coefficients are then estimated using the
   Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method. Considering variations
   in river discharges, pollutant loads from tributaries, and reaction
   coefficients, the violation probabilities of existing water quality
   standards at several locations in the river were computed from the AFOSM
   and MFOSM methods, and the results were compared with those from the
   Monte Carlo method. The statistics of the three uncertainty analysis
   methods show that the outputs from the AFOSM and MFOSM methods are
   similar to those from the Monte Carlo method. From a practical model
   selection perspective, the MFOSM method is more attractive in terms of
   its computational simplicity and execution time.}},

Abstract = {{A macroscale hydrologic model is developed for regional climate
   assessment studies under way in the southeastern United States. The
   hydrologic modeling strategy is developed to optimize spatial
   representation of basin characteristics while maximizing computational
   efficiency. The model employs the ``grouped response unit{''}
   methodology, which follows the natural drainage pattern of the area.
   First order streams are delineated and their surface characteristics are
   tested so that areas with statistically similar characteristics can be
   combined into larger computational zones for modeling purposes.
   Hydrologic response units (HRU) are identified within the modeling units
   and a simple three-layer water balance model, Soil and Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT), is executed for each HRU. The runoff values are then
   convoluted using a triangular unit hydrograph and routed by
   Muskingum-Cunge method. The methodology is shown to produce accurate
   results relative to other studies, when compared to observations. The
   model is used to evaluate the potential error in hydrologic assessments
   when using GCM predictions as climatic input in a rainfall-runoff
   dominated environment. In such areas, the results from this study,
   although Limited in temporal and spatial scope, appear to imply that use
   of GCM climate predictions in short term quantitative analyses studies
   in rainfall-runoff dominated environments should proceed with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Hyetographs are essential to many hydrological designs. Many studies
   have shown that hyetographs are specific to storm types and durations.
   Recent work presented evidence that dimensionless hyetographs are scale
   invariant. We show that the simple scaling property of rainfall
   guarantees that the normalized rainfall rates of different storm
   durations are identically distributed and propose a nonstationary
   Gauss-Markov model based on the annual maximum events that arise from
   the dominant storm type. We derive the unique estimators for the
   parameters of the Gauss-Markov model under two constraints that: (a) the
   typical peak rainfall rate is preserved, and (b) the most likely
   hyetograph is obtained. One attractive feature of this model is that it
   allows translating hyetographs between storms of different durations.
   Two examples illustrate our model.}},

Abstract = {{In southern Alberta, as elsewhere, pressures on limited water supplies
   are increasing. Not surprisingly, a great deal of attention has been
   focused on irrigated agriculture, which accounts for the largest share
   of water consumed in the region. In order to meet broadly accepted water
   conservation goals, some commentators have suggested that irrigation
   water use should be metered and that irrigators should be charged based
   on the amount of water used. An alternative proposal would have water
   management authorities rely upon the perceived adaptability of
   irrigators. This paper offers a perspective on the willingness of
   irrigators to conserve water.
   Based on a survey of 183 irrigation farmers conducted over the summer
   and early fall of 1998, we found that irrigators are generally aware of
   the need to conserve water and soil moisture, and that a variety of
   water conserving strategies were being employed. Water saving
   technologies specific to irrigation agriculture were less widely
   adopted. The findings suggest that there is considerable potential to
   reduce the amount of water consumed by the irrigation sector through
   increased efficiency, but that change will be limited if current
   economic circumstances and institutional arrangements persist.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Channel instability and aquatic ecosystem degradation have been linked
   to watershed imperviousness in humid regions of the U.S. In an effort to
   provide a more process-based linkage between observed thresholds of
   aquatic ecosystem degradation and urbanization, standard single event
   approaches (U.S. Geological Survey Flood Regression Equations and
   rational) and continuous hydrologic models (HSPF and CASC2D) were used
   to examine potential changes in flow regime associated with varying
   levels of watershed imperviousness. The predicted changes in flow
   parameters were then interpreted in concert with risk-based models of
   channel form and instability. Although low levels of imperviousness (10
   to 20 percent) clearly have the potential to destabilize streams,
   changes in discharge, and thus stream power, associated with increased
   impervious area are highly variable and dependent upon
   watershed-specific conditions. In addition to the storage
   characteristics of the pre-development watershed, the magnitude of
   change is sensitive to the connectivity and conveyance of impervious
   areas as well as the specific characteristics of the receiving channels.
   Different stream types are likely to exhibit varying degrees and types
   of instability, depending on entrenchment, relative erodibility of bed
   and banks, riparian condition, mode of sediment transport (bedload
   versus suspended load), and proximity to geomorphic thresholds.
   Nonetheless, simple risk-based analyses of the potential impacts of land
   use change on aquatic ecosystems have the potential to redirect and
   improve the effectiveness of watershed management strategies by
   facilitating the identification of channels that may be most sensitive
   to changes in stream power.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of forecasting the discharge time
   series of a river by means of a chaotic approach. To this aim, we first
   check for some evidence of chaotic behavior in the dynamic by
   considering a set of different procedures, namely, the phase portrait of
   the attractor, the correlation dimension, and the largest Lyapunov
   exponent. Their joint application seems to confirm the presence of a
   nonlinear deterministic dynamic of chaotic type. Second, we consider the
   so-called nearest neighbors predictor and we compare it with a classical
   linear model. By comparing these two predictors, it seems that nonlinear
   river flow modeling, and in particular chaotic modeling, is an effective
   method to improve predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Inputs of copper-based crop protectants from tomato fields grown under
   plastic mulch agriculture (plasticulture) to an estuarine creek were
   investigated. Copper was measured in runoff from diverse land-uses
   including conventional agriculture, plasticulture, residences, and
   natural areas. Water column and sediment copper concentrations were
   measured in plasticulture and control (nonagriculture) watersheds.
   Copper concentrations in plasticulture-impacted creeks exceeded
   background levels episodically. High concentrations occurred during or
   immediately after runoff producing rains. Concentrations of 263 mug/L
   total copper and 126 mug/L dissolved copper were measured in a tidal
   creek affected by plasticulture; concentrations exceeded the shellfish
   LC50 values and the water quality criteria of 2.9 mug/L dissolved
   copper. Control watersheds indicated background water column levels of
   less than or equal to 4 mug/L dissolved copper with similar copper
   levels during periods with and without rain. The copper concentrations
   in tomato plasticulture field runoff itself contained up to 238 mug/L
   dissolved copper. Copper concentrations in runoff from other land-uses
   were less than 5 mug/L dissolved copper. Creek sediment samples adjacent
   to a plasticulture field contained significantly higher copper
   concentrations than sediments taken from nonplasticulture watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Economic values of riparian buffers in a watershed are evaluated by the
   changes in the net economic return for farming with and without riparian
   buffers when achieving the same water quality objectives. The simulated
   water quality impacts of alternative farming systems using SWAT and
   experimental data for riparian buffers are used in a mathematical
   optimization model to estimate net economic return for farming subject
   to a water quality objective. Physical characteristics such as stream
   length, channel slope, average land slope, cropland percentage and
   several soil attributes are identified in the watershed using ARC/INFO
   GIS. A regression model is then used to evaluate the impacts of these
   physical characteristics on the estimated economic values of buffers.
   The study is conducted in Goodwater Creek watershed, Missouri. The
   results show the estimated economic value of buffers is significantly
   affected by some soil properties, stream length, and cropland percentage
   in watershed and can be used to improve the effectiveness of riparian
   buffers at watershed and regional levels.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{305-314}},

Abstract = {{Increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has the secondary effect on
   plants of reducing transpiration. The degree of reduction in
   transpiration has been studied mostly at the leaf scale and as such, has
   not taken feedbacks into account that come into play when the plant
   canopy or the atmosphere as a whole is considered. The objective of this
   paper is to examine the role of negative feedback processes that act
   through the dynamics of the canopy and the atmosphere. This is done
   through the application of two canopy models, one of which is later
   coupled to a full Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM) called
   GENESIS. The results suggest that the reduction in transpiration in a
   double CO2 environment compared to present day will not be as
   considerable as the leaf scale experiments suggest - a 7 percent
   reduction compared to 15 to 57 percent when feedbacks are considered. At
   the regional scale, precipitation patterns appear to be the primary
   factor in determining evapotranspiration. The implications for
   agriculture, in terms of water usage, would therefore not seem to be as
   acute as the leaf scale experiments depict. Regarding climate change,
   there is a suggestion that regional water usage may vary from present
   day values in certain areas.}},

Abstract = {{A free water surface (FWS) constructed wetland was installed at a dairy
   in Glendale, Arizona, to study the potential of such a wetland to remove
   nitrogen (N) from wastewater. The study objectives were: (1) to
   determine N removal from the wastewater, and (2) to evaluate N
   accumulation in soil and plant tissues. The system consisted of eight
   cells (70 x 9 x 1.5 m) planted with Typha domingensis, Scirpus validus,
   and Phragmites australis. The four cells in series were lined with
   plastic, and the four cells in a parallel series were lined with clay.
   Cells received approximately 180 m(3)/d. of partially treated dairy
   effluent. Plant tissues and soil samples were collected above and below
   ground from 24 locations during one year. Total N removal from
   wastewater was about 17 percent. Clay-lined cells accumulated more N in
   the soil and less N in plant biomass compared with plastic lined cells.
   Plant biomass accounted for approximately 60 percent of total N
   accumulated in cells with dense plant communities. Ninety percent of
   accumulated soil N was organic. Total N accumulated in soil reached a
   maximum (1,100 mg/kg) eight months after the introduction of wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{Karst terrane provides a linkage between surface water and ground water
   regimes by means of caves, sinkholes and swallets, and sinking streams,
   and facilitates the inter-watershed transfer of water and contaminants
   through these subsurface systems. The goal of this study was to develop
   procedures to identify the sources of degradation of a creek situated in
   a complex karst-water system. The study approach consisted of using dye
   tracing technique to determine subsurface flow paths through the karst
   system, a water-sampling network to identify and characterize pollution
   sources within the surface watershed and subsurface flow regime, and
   evaluation of analytical data for several water quality parameters. The
   results of this study provide an interesting perspective of water and
   contaminant movement in karst-water systems and pinpoint the sources of
   stream contamination for a case study site in southwest Virginia where
   two springs supply water to a contaminated freshwater stream.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic landscapes are multiples or variations of fundamental
   hydrologic landscape units. A fundamental hydrologic landscape unit is
   defined on the basis of land-surface form, geology, and climate. The
   basic land-surface form of a fundamental hydrologic landscape unit is an
   upland separated from a lowland by an intervening steeper slope.
   Fundamental hydrologic landscape units have a complete hydrologic system
   consisting of surface runoff, ground-water flow, and interaction with
   atmospheric water. By describing actual landscapes in terms of
   land-surface slope, hydraulic properties of soils and geologic
   framework, and the difference between precipitation and
   evapotranspiration, the hydrologic system of actual landscapes can be
   conceptualized in a uniform way. This conceptual framework can then be
   the foundation for design of studies and data networks, syntheses of
   information on local to national scales, and comparison of process
   research across small study units in a variety of settings. The Crow
   Wing River watershed in central Minnesota is used as an example of
   evaluating stream discharge in the context of hydrologic landscapes.
   Lake-research watersheds in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, and
   Nebraska are used as an example of using the hydrologic-landscapes
   concept to evaluate the effect of ground water on the degree of
   mineralization and major-ion chemistry of lakes that lie within
   ground-water flow systems.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature is an important variable structuring lotic biotas, but
   little is known about how montane landscapes function to determine
   stream temperatures. We developed an a priori hypothesis that was used
   to predict how watershed elements would interact to affect stream
   temperatures. The hypothesis was tested in a series of path analyses
   using temperature data from 26 sites on second-order to fourth-order
   streams across a fifth-order Rocky Mountain watershed. Based on the
   performance of the first hypothesis, two revised versions of the
   hypothesis were developed and tested that proved to be more accurate
   than the original hypothesis. The most plausible of the revised
   hypotheses accounted for 82 percent of the variation in maximum stream
   temperature, had a predicted data structure that did not deviate from
   the empirical data structure, and was the most parsimonious. The final
   working hypothesis suggested that stream temperature maxima were
   directly controlled by a large negative effect from mean basin elevation
   (direct effect = -0.57, p < 0.01) and smaller effects from riparian tree
   abundance (direct effect = -0.28, p = 0.03), and cattle density (direct
   effect = 0.24, p = 0.05). Watershed slope, valley constraint, and the
   abundance of grass across a watershed also affected temperature maxima,
   but these effects were indirect and mediated through cattle density and
   riparian trees. Three variables included in the a priori hypothesis -
   watershed aspect, stream width, and watershed size - had negligible
   effects on maximum stream temperatures and were omitted from the final
   working hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Rhodamine WT dye-tracer injections in rivers of the Willamette Basin
   yield concentration-time curves with characteristically long recession
   times suggestive of active transient storage processes. The scale of
   drainage areas contributing to the stream reaches studied in the
   Willamette Basin ranges from 10 to 12,000 km(2). A transient storage
   assessment of the tracer studies has been completed using the U.S.
   Geological Survey's One-dimensional Transport with Inflow and Storage
   (OTIS) model, which incorporates storage exchange and decay functions
   along with the traditional dispersion and advection transport equation.
   The analysis estimates solute transport of the dye. It identifies
   first-order decay coefficients to be on the order of 10(-5)/sed for the
   nonconservative Rhodamine WT. On an individual subreach basis, the
   first-order decay is slower (typically by an order of magnitude) than
   the transient storage process, indicating that nonconservative tracers
   may be used to evaluate transient storage in rivers. In the transient
   storage analysis, a dimensionless parameter (A(S)/A) expresses the
   spatial extent of storage zone area relative to stream cross section. In
   certain reaches of Willamette Basin pool-and-riffle, gravel-bed rivers,
   this parameter was as large as 0.5. A measure of the storage exchange
   flux was calculated for each stream subreach in the simulation analysis.
   This storage exchange is shown subjectively to be higher at higher
   stream discharges. Hyporheic linkage between streams and subsurface
   flows is the probable physical mechanism contributing to a significant
   part of this inferred active transient storage. Hyporheic linkages are
   further suggested by detailed measurements of river discharge with an
   Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler system delineating zones in two large
   rivers where water alternately enters and leaves the surface channels
   through gravel-and-cobble riverbeds. Measurements show patterns of
   hyporheic exchange that are highly variable in time and space.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental background levels of Pb were measured in ponds, river
   waters, sediments, suspended sediments, rocks, and air particulates
   within the Kankakee watershed during the period of 1995 to 1999. Stable
   isotopic Pb distinguished airborne Pb and its incorporation into
   riverine wetland sediments from geogenic Pb measured in river sediments.
   The provenance of the naturally-occurring Pb is from carbonate bedrock
   and contributes comparable concentrations in riverbank sediments
   (25.9-30.4 mg kg(-1)) as Pb found in wetland sediments (18.6-24.8 mg
   kg(-1)). Estimates of anthropogenic Pb contributions from airfall into
   the Kankakee wetlands were found to be near 0.43-0.71 Bq cm(-2) yr(-1)
   during 1995 to 1999. While leachable Pb data suggests the uppermost
   layers of pond sediments were disturbed, Pb-210 analyses from
   undisturbed sedimentation suggests Pb-bearing sediments accumulate
   approximately 0.46-0.51 cm yr(-1) in the ponds within the riparian
   zones. Transboundary Pb pollution from aerosols of industrial Pb across
   the Great Lakes occurs, but Pb isotopy indicates that the Pb
   concentrations are comparable to natural concentrations of Pb in both
   waters and sediments within the Kankakee watershed.}},

   input data to the interface include: soil, digital elevation model, land
   use/cover, water features, climate, and information on management

Abstract = {{Fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli,, enterococci, and somatic coliphages
   were detected in samples from 31 sites on streams draining urban and
   agricultural regions of the Puget Sound Basin Lowlands. Densities of
   bacteria in 48 and 71 percent of the samples exceeded U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency's freshwater recreation criteria for Escherichia coli
   and enterococci, respectively, and 81 percent exceeded Washington State
   fecal coliform standards. Male-specific coliphages were detected in
   samples from 15 sites. Male-specific F(+)RNA coliphages isolated from
   samples taken at South Fork Thornton and Longfellow Creeks were
   serotyped as Group II, implicating humans as potential contaminant
   sources. These two sites are located in residential, urban areas.
   F(+)RNA coliphages in samples from 10 other sites, mostly in
   agricultural or rural areas, were serotyped as Group I, implicating
   non-human animals as likely sources. Chemicals common to wastewater,
   including fecal sterols, were detected in samples from several urban
   streams, and also implicate humans, at least in part, as possible
   sources of fecal bacteria and viruses to the streams.}},

Abstract = {{A computerized technique was developed to identify storm runoff episodes
   and calculate storm discharges, storm loads, and storm average
   concentrations for each event in datasets with up to 10,000 records.
   This technique was applied to four watersheds within the Lake Erie
   drainage basin and identified between 160 and 250 runoff events in each.
   Storm event loads and storm event mean concentrations were calculated
   for each runoff event for suspended solids, total phosphorus, soluble
   reactive phosphorus, nitrate, and total Kjeldahl nitrogen. The basic
   characteristics of the resulting data are described, as are systematic
   differences as a function of watershed size, seasonal differences, and
   trends over time. Many of the results of this study reflect the
   importance of nonpoint processes and improvements in agricultural best
   management practices in these watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic programming (GP), a relatively new evolutionary technique, is
   demonstrated in this study to evolve codes for the solution of problems.
   First, a simple example in the area of symbolic regression is
   considered. GP is then applied to real-time runoff forecasting for the
   Orgeval catchment in France. In this study, GP functions as an error
   updating scheme to complement a rainfall-runoff model, MIKE11/NAM.
   Hourly runoff forecasts of different updating intervals are performed
   for forecast horizons of up to nine hours. The results show that the
   proposed updating scheme is able to predict the runoff quite accurately
   for all updating intervals considered and particularly for updating
   intervals not exceeding the time of concentration of the catchment. The
   results are also compared with those of an earlier study, by the World
   Meteorological Organization, in which autoregression and Kalman filter
   were used as the updating methods. Comparisons show that GP is a better
   updating tool for real-time flow forecasting. Another important finding
   from this study is that nondimensionalizing the variables enhances the
   symbolic regression process significantly.}},

Abstract = {{The deep aquifers of the Portland Basin are used as a regional water
   supply by at least six municipalities in Oregon and Washington. Maximum
   continuous use of the aquifers in 1998 was 13 mgd and peak emergency use
   was 55 mgd. Continuous use of the deep aquifers at a rate of 55 mgd has
   been proposed and inchoate water rights have been reserved for expansion
   of pumping to 121 mgd. A study was completed, using a calibrated ground
   water flow model, to evaluate the role of induced recharge from the
   Columbia River in mitigating aquifer drawdown from continuous-use and
   expanded pumping scenarios in the center and eastern areas of the basin.
   The absolute average residual was less than 3.6 feet for steady-state
   model calibrations, and less than 8.0 feet for transient calibration to
   a 42 mgd pumping event in 1987 with 170 feet of drawdown. Continuous use
   of the aquifers at a rate of 55 mgd is predicted to increase drawdown to
   210 feet. Expansion of pumping to 121 mgd in the center basin is
   predicted to cause 400 feet of drawdown. However, expansion of pumping
   in the east basin is predicted to result in only 220 feet of drawdown
   because of induced recharge from the Columbia River.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic modification of flood plains by human activity is the primary
   cause of rising flood damages throughout the world. As flood-plain
   hydraulic roughness increases, so does the water level for a fixed flow
   rate. This raises the flood damage associated with a flood of given
   return period, and thus, magnifies the flood risk. This article presents
   an approach that integrates climatic, hydrologic, and hydraulic
   principles and presents models to discern the probable causes of flood
   damage in a basin that undergoes flood-plain development. The article
   documents key factors that govern flood damage and presents a case study
   that illustrates the principles of forensic hydrology in an impacted
   flood plain. The study demonstrates flood level rise caused by hydraulic
   alteration of a flood plain between 1969 and 1995 and apportioned the
   increased water level among agricultural and structural factors located
   in the study area.}},

Abstract = {{Several factors affect the occurrence and transport of pesticides in
   surface waters of the 29,400 km(2) White River Basin in Indiana. A
   relationship was found between pesticide use and the average annual
   concentration of that; pesticide in the White River, although this
   relationship varies for different classes of pesticides. About one
   percent of the mass applied of each of the commonly used agricultural
   herbicides was transported from the basin via the White River. Peak
   pesticide concentrations were typically highest in late spring or early
   summer and were associated with periods of runoff following application.
   Concentrations of diazinon were higher in an urban basin than in two
   agricultural basins, corresponding to the common use of this insecticide
   on lawns and gardens in urban areas. Concentrations of atrazine, a corn
   herbicide widely used in the White River Basin, were higher in an
   agricultural basin with permeable, well-drained soils, than in an
   agricultural basin with less permeable, more poorly drained soils.
   Although use of butylate and cyanazine was comparable in the White River
   Basin between 1992 and 1994, concentrations in the White River of
   butylate, which is incorporated into soil, were substantially less than
   for cyanazine, which is typically applied to the soil surface.}},

Abstract = {{Levee sump systems are used by many riverine communities for temporary
   storage of urban wet weather flows. The hydrologic performance and
   transport of stormwater pollutants in sump systems, however, have not
   been systematically studied. The objective of this paper is to present a
   case study to demonstrate development and application of a procedure for
   assessing the hydraulic performance of flood control sumps in an urban
   watershed. Two sumps of highly variable physical and hydraulic
   characteristics were selected for analysis. A hydrologic modeling
   package was used to estimate the flow hydrograph for each outfall as
   part of the flow balance for the sump. To validate these results, a
   water balance was used to estimate the total runoff using sump
   operational data. The hydrologic model calculations provide a
   satisfactory estimate of the total runoff and its time-distribution to
   the sump. The model was then used to estimate pollutant loads to the
   sump and to the river. Although flow of stormwater through a sump system
   is regulated solely by flood-control requirements, these sumps may
   function as sedimentation basins that provide purification of
   stormwater. A sample calculation of removals of several conventional
   pollutants in the target sumps using a mass balance approach is
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{An articulated concrete block revetment system was developed by the U.S.
   Army Corps of Engineers to test and evaluate the practicability of the
   protocols for overtopping and channelized flow conditions. Test
   facilities were constructed, prototype articulated concrete blocks were
   fabricated and installed into the facilities, and the blocks were tested
   using the established protocols. The test; results indicated that both
   the overtopping and channel flow tests yielded similar results: the
   blocks reached a point of instability at approximately the same velocity
   and shear stresses. The similar test results indicate that only one
   protocol is required to evaluate an articulated concrete block system.
   It was demonstrated that both protocols can be effectively conducted. It
   is recommended that the overtopping test be adapted as a standard test
   procedure because of its reduced construction costs and its efficiency
   compared to the channelized test.}},

Abstract = {{A scaled hydraulic model was used as a schematic representation of the
   Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station (PBAPS) discharge into Conowingo Pond
   during critically low river flows. The model approximated flow and
   temperature patterns and the degree of recirculation are assessed. Under
   normal operation the effluent is carried downstream and dissipated
   within about two miles. However, during dry weather years, river inflows
   can decrease substantially, resulting in unknown recirculation of
   effluent and flow patterns in Conowingo Pond. This study was conducted
   to investigate and predict flow patterns in Conowingo Pond under
   critically dry weather conditions. A threshold river flow is also
   identified that indicates a measure of the river's ability to maintain
   downstream advection of the effluent. The study suggests a number of
   unexpected current patterns, potential recirculation of the effluent,
   and changes in the dilution of the effluent.}},

Abstract = {{Demand side management is being used increasingly by Ontario
   municipalities as a way to improve the efficiency of water use, defer
   the costs associated with constructing new water treatment works, and
   minimize the environmental impacts associated with supplying water A
   comprehensive survey of 153 Ontario municipalities was completed in
   mid-1998. These ranged in size from small rural townships (with
   populations as low as 500 people) to the province's largest urban
   center, Metropolitan Toronto, with a population of approximately 2.5
   million people. The questionnaire measured the use of six broad types of
   demand side measures, including water pricing and metering; municipal
   by-laws (ordinances) that promote water conservation; operational and
   maintenance measures to reduce water losses and consumption;
   water-saving plumbing fixtures and devices; public participation
   programs that encourage water conservation; and other measures, such as
   water audits. Additionally, the survey collected data on implementation
   barriers and opportunities. Since the last comprehensive Ontario survey,
   conducted in 1987 by Kreutzwiser and Feagan (1989), there has been an
   increase in the use of basic tools such as metering and pricing,
   plumbing fixtures, and public participation programs. Additionally, new
   initiatives, such as water audits and computerized monitoring equipment,
   are being used. However, in many areas opportunities exist to make
   better use of demand side measures. Unfortunately, municipal capacity to
   do so often is constrained by (among other factors) limited finances,
   lack of political will, and public resistance. Demonstration of real
   cost savings to consumers, and the development of specific goals and
   objectives for demand side management programs, are two important steps
   needed to overcome these challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Transient events in water chemistry in small coastal watersheds,
   particularly pH depressions, are largely driven by inputs of
   precipitation. While the response of each watershed depends upon both
   the nature of the precipitation event and the season of the year, how
   the response changes over time can provide insight into landscape
   changes. Neural network models for an urban watershed and a
   rural-suburban watershed were developed in an attempt to detect changes
   in system response resulting from changes in the landscape. Separate
   models for describing pH depressions for wet season and dry season
   conditions were developed for a seven year period at each watershed. The
   neural network models allowed separation of the effects of precipitation
   variations and changes in watershed response. The ability to detect
   trends in pH depression magnitudes was improved by analyzing neural
   network residuals rather than the raw data. Examination of sensitivity
   plots of the models indicated how the neural networks were affected by
   different inputs. There were large differences in effects between
   seasons in the rural-suburban watershed whereas effects in the urban
   watershed were consistent between seasons. During the study period, the
   urban watershed showed no change in pH depression response, while the
   rural-suburban watershed showed a significant increase in the magnitude
   of pH depressions, likely the result of increased urbanization.}},

Abstract = {{A set of procedures for identifying changes in selected streamflow
   characteristics at sites having long-term continuous streamflow records
   is illustrated by using streamflow data from the Waccamaw River at
   Freeland, North Carolina for the 55-year period of 1940-1994. Data were
   evaluated and compared to streamflows in the adjacent Lumber River Basin
   to determine if changes in streamflow characteristics in the Waccamaw
   River were localized and possibly the result of some human activity, or
   consistent with regional variations. Following 1963, droughts in the
   Waccamaw Basin seem to have been less severe than in the Lumber Basin,
   and the annual one-, seven-, and 30-day low flows exhibited a slightly
   increasing trend in the Waccamaw River. Mean daily flows in the Waccamaw
   River at the 90 percent exceedance level (low flows) during 1985-194, a
   relatively dry period, were very nearly equal to flows at the same
   exceedance level for 1970-1979, which represents the 10-year period
   between 1940 and 1994 with the highest flows. Prior to the 1980s, flows
   per unit drainage area in the Waccamaw Basin were generally less than
   those in the Lumber Basin, but after 1980, the opposite was true. The
   ratio of base flow to runoff in the Waccamaw River may have changed
   relative to that in the Lumber River in the late 1970s. There was
   greater variability in Waccamaw River streamflow than in Lumber River
   flow, and flow variability in the Waccamaw River may have increased
   slightly during 1985-1994.}},

Abstract = {{Appalachian mountain alluvial wetlands include floodplain forests
   interspersed with fens or bogs. This study evaluates the water table
   dynamics of an Appalachian mountain floodplain which includes a
   depressional fen. Water table wells and piezometers documented seasonal
   patterns of the water table and the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) in
   the floodplain and fen areas. Additional water table wells determined
   the potential sources of water from adjacent hillslopes to the fen area.
   The water table of the floodplain and the fen exhibited distinct regular
   seasonal fluctuations. The water table remained near the surface of the
   fen from late winter through late spring and dropped 20 to 80 cm during
   the summer between precipitation events. The water table of the
   floodplain fluctuated more but followed similar patterns and was
   typically within 40 cm of the surface during late winter and early
   spring months and greater than 60 cm during the summer months. The water
   table of the floodplain was more often correlated to precipitation than
   the water table of the fen. The VHG in the floodplain was highly
   variable although seasonal patterns of upwelling of water in fall and
   downwelling in winter were common. The VHG of the fen showed a
   consistent downwelling of water and suggested that the fen serves as a
   recharge area for an aquifer. Principal sources of water for the fen
   appeared to be precipitation, inflow from a shallow aquifer on an
   adjacent slope plus increased interflow associated with precipitation
   events from another adjacent slope. The influence of soil texture on
   water dynamics of the fen or floodplain was not fully ascertained but
   ii; appeared to influence horizontal flow from hillslopes and the depth
   of the water table in the fen.}},

Abstract = {{A regional water conservation system for drought management involves
   many uncertain factors. Water received from precipitation may stay on
   the ground surface, evaporate back into the atmosphere, or infiltrate
   into the ground. Reliable estimates of the amount of evapotranspiration
   and infiltration are not available for a large basin, especially during
   periods of drought. By applying a geographic information system, this
   study develops procedures to investigate spatial variations of
   unavailable water for given levels of drought severity. Levels of
   drought severity are defined by truncated values of monthly
   precipitation and daily streamflow to reflect levels of water
   availability The greater the truncation level, the lower the
   precipitation or streamflow. Truncation levels of monthly precipitation
   are recorded in depth of water while those of daily streamflow are
   converted into monthly equivalent water depths. Truncation levels of
   precipitation and streamflow treated as regionalized variables are
   spatially interpolated by the unbiased minimum variance estimation. The
   interpolated results are vector values of precipitation and streamflow
   at a grid of points covering the studied basin. They are then converted
   into raster-based values and expressed graphically. The image
   subtraction operation is used to subtract the image of streamflow from
   that of precipitation at their corresponding level of drought severity.
   It is done on a cell-by-cell basis resulting in new attribute values to
   form the spatial image representing a spatial distribution of potential
   water loss at a given level of drought severity.}},

Abstract = {{The Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) is a single number that expresses
   water quality by integrating measurements of eight water quality
   variables (temperature, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, pH,
   ammonia+nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, total solids, and fecal
   coliform). Its purpose is to provide a simple and concise method for
   expressing the ambient water quality of Oregon's streams for general
   recreational use, including fishing and swimming. The OWQI, originally
   developed in the 1970s, has been updated based upon improved
   understanding about water quality behavior. This report describes the
   historical basis of the OWQI and defines the improved design of the
   present OWQI. The index allows users to easily interpret data and relate
   overall water quality variation to variations in specific categories of
   impairment. This report demonstrates the value of the OWQI in presenting
   spatial and temporal water quality information. The OWQI improves
   comprehension of general water quality issues, communicates water
   quality status, and illustrates the need for and effectiveness of
   protective practices.}},

Abstract = {{The high spatial variability of nitrate concentrations in ground water
   of many regions is thought to be closely related to spatially-variable
   leaching rates from agricultural activities. To clarify the relative
   roles of the different nitrate leaching controlling variables under
   irrigated agriculture in northeastern Colorado, we conducted an
   extensive series of leaching simulations with the NLEAP modal using best
   estimates of local agricultural practices. The results of these
   simulations were then used with GIS to estimate the spatial variability
   of leachate quality for a 14,000 ha area overlying the alluvial aquifer
   of the South Platte River. Simulations showed that in the study area,
   differences in soil type might lead to 5-10 kg/ha of N variation in
   annual leaching rates while variability due to crop rotations was as
   much as 65 kg-N/ha for common rotations. Land application of manure from
   confined animal feeding operations may account for more than 100 kg-N/ha
   additional leaching. For a selected index rotation, the simulated
   nitrogen leaching rates across the area varied from 10 to 299 kg/ha and
   simulated water volumes leached ranged from 13 to 76 cm/yr depending on
   soil type, irrigation type, and use of manure. Resulting leachate
   concentrations of 3.5-140 mg/l NO3 as N were simulated. Land application
   of manure was found to be the most important factor determining the mass
   flux of nitrate leached and the combination of sprinkler irrigation and
   manure application yields the highest leachate concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a methodology to evaluate the vulnerability of water
   resources in the Tsengwen creek watershed, Taiwan. Tsengwen reservoir,
   located in the Tsengwen creek watershed, is a multipurpose reservoir
   with a primary function to supply water for the ChiaNan Irrigation
   District. A simulation procedure was developed to evaluate the impacts
   of climate change on the water resources system. The simulation
   procedure includes a streamflow model, a weather generation model, a
   sequent peak algorithm, and a risk assessment process. Three climate
   change scenarios were constructed based on the predictions of three
   General Circulation Models (CCCM, GFDL, and GISS). The impacts of
   climate change on streamflows were simulated, and, for each climate
   change scenario, the agricultural water demand was adjusted based on the
   change of potential evapotranspiration. Simulation results indicated
   that the climate change may increase the annual and seasonal streamflows
   in the Tsengwen creek watershed. The increase in streamflows during wet
   periods may result in serious flooding. In addition, despite the
   increase in streamflows, the risk of water deficit may still increase
   from between 4 and 7 percent to between 7 and 13 percent due to higher
   agricultural water demand. The simulation results suggest that the
   reservoir capacity may need to be expanded. In response to the climate
   change, four strategies are suggested: (1) strengthen flood mitigation
   measures, (2) enhance drought protection strategies, (3) develop new
   water resources technology, and (4) educate the public.}},

Abstract = {{Baseflow, or water that enters a stream from slowly varying sources such
   as ground water, can be critical to humans and ecosystems. We evaluate a
   simple method for estimating baseflow parameters at ungaged sites. The
   method uses one or more baseflow discharge measurements at the ungaged
   site and longterm streamflow data from a nearby gaged site. A given
   baseflow parameter, such as the median, is estimated as the product of
   the corresponding gage site parameter and the geometric mean of the
   ratios of the measured baseflow discharges and the concurrent discharges
   at the gage site. If baseflows at gaged and ungaged sites have a
   bivariate lognormal distribution with high correlation and nearly equal
   log variances, the estimated baseflow parameters are very accurate. We
   tested the proposed method using long-term streamflow data from two
   watershed pairs in the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin. For one
   watershed pair, the theoretical assumptions are well met; for the other
   the log-variances are substantially different. In the first case, the
   method performs well for estimating both annual and long-term baseflow
   parameters. In the second, the method performs remarkably well for
   estimating annual mean and annual median baseflow discharge, but less
   well for estimating the annual lower decile and the long-term mean,
   median, and lower decile. In general, the use of four measurements in a
   year is not substantially better than the use of two.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical modeling techniques are used to analyze streamflow depletion
   for stream-aquifer systems with baseflow. The analyses calculated two
   flow components generated by a pumping well located at a given distance
   from a river that is hydraulically connected to an unconfined aquifer.
   The two components are induced stream infiltration and reduced baseflow;
   both contribute to total streamflow depletion. Simulation results
   suggest that the induced infiltration, the volume of water discharged
   from the stream to the aquifer, has a shorter term impact on streamflow,
   while the reduced baseflow curves show a longer term effect. The peak
   impacts of the two hydrologic processes on streamflow occur separately.
   The separate analysis helps in understanding the hydrologic interactions
   between stream and aquifer. Practically, it provides useful information
   about contaminant transport from stream to aquifer when water quality is
   a concern, and for areas where water quantity is an issue, the separate
   analysis offers additional information to the development of water
   resource management plan.}},

Abstract = {{An optimal control methodology and computational model are developed to
   evaluate multi-reservoir release schedules that minimize sediment scour
   and deposition in rivers and reservoirs. The sedimentation problem is
   formulated within a discrete-time optimal control framework in which
   reservoir releases represent control variables and reservoir bed
   elevations, storage levels, and river bed elevations represent state
   variables. Constraints imposed on reservoir storage levels and releases
   are accommodated using a penalty function method. The optimal control
   model consists of two interfaced components: a one-dimensional
   finite-difference simulation module used to evaluate flow hydraulics and
   sediment transport dynamics, and a successive approximation linear
   quadratic regulator (SALQR) optimization algorithm used to update
   reservoir release policies and solve the augmented control problem.
   Hypothetical two-reservoir and five-reservoir networks are used to
   demonstrate the methodology and its capabilities, which is a vital phase
   towards the development of a more robust optimal control model and
   application to an existing multiple-reservoir river network.}},

Abstract = {{The environment surrounding urban streams imposes constraints upon
   stream enhancement projects. Constraints include bridges, culverts,
   highways, sewer and water lines, lack of easements, and other floodplain
   structures. The consequences of failure of these infrastructure
   constraints can be significant and should be considered in the design
   process. Fault tree analysis provides a systematic technique for
   analyzing the interactions of events that could lead to infrastructure
   failure. A case study of a stream in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, shows
   that fault tree analysis can effectively model the interactions between
   the stream system and the infrastructure constraints and predict the
   most likely modes of failure. In addition, the relative success of
   alternative designs and failure mitigation techniques can be assessed
   using this analysis tool, lending insight into the urban stream
   enhancement design process. The method could also provide justification
   in the design permitting process and input for risk assessment.}},

Abstract = {{Over a three-year period, flow and nutrients were monitored at 13 sites
   in the upper North Bosque River watershed in Texas. Drainage areas above
   sampling sites differed in percent of dairy waste application fields,
   forage fields, wood/range, and urban land area. A multiple regression
   approach was used to develop total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen
   (TN) export coefficients for the major land uses in these heterogeneous
   drainage areas. The largest export coefficients were associated with
   dairy waste application fields followed by urban, forage fields, and
   wood/range. An empirical model was then established to assess nutrient
   contribution by major sources using developed export coefficients and
   point source loadings from municipal wastewater treatment. This model
   was verified by comparison of estimated loadings to measured in-stream
   data. Monte Carlo simulation techniques were applied to provide an
   uncertainty analysis for nutrient loads by source, based on the variance
   associated with each export coefficient. The largest sources of
   nutrients contributing to the upper North Bosque River were associated
   with dairy waste application fields and forage fields, while the
   greatest relative uncertainty in source contribution was associated with
   loadings from urban and wood/range land uses.}},

Abstract = {{Stream channels are known tb change their form as a result of watershed
   urbanization, but do they restabilize under subsequent conditions of
   constant urban land use? Streams in seven developed and developing
   watersheds (drainage areas 5-35 km(2)) in the Puget Sound lowlands were
   evaluated for their channel stability and degree of urbanization, using
   geld and historical data. Protocols for determining channel stability by
   visual assessment, calculated bed mobility at bankfull flows, and
   resurveyed cross-sections were compared and yielded nearly identical
   results. We found that channel restabilization generally does occur
   within one or two decades of constant watershed land use, but it is not
   universal. When (or if) an individual stream will restabilize depends on
   specific hydrologic and geomorphic characteristics of the channel and
   its watershed; observed stability is not well predicted by simply the
   magnitude of urban development or the rate of ongoing land-use change.
   The tendency for channel restabilization suggests that management
   efforts focused primarily on maintaining stability, particularly in a
   still-urbanizing watershed, may not always be necessary. Yet physical
   stability alone is not a sufficient condition for a biologically healthy
   stream, and additional rehabilitation measures will almost certainly be
   required to restore biological conditions in urban systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Nonpoint Source Model (NPSM) was chosen for nonpoint source
   pollutant modeling within three different watersheds. The first step in
   using NPSM, hydrologic calibration, is discussed here for three 8-digit
   Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUCs) from the White River Basin in Indiana
   (Driftwood HUG), the Albemarle-Pamlico River Basin in Virginia and North
   Carolina (Contentnea HUG), and the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint
   River Basin in Alabama, Georgia, and Florida (Ichawaynochaway HUG).
   Model predicted flows were compared statistically with USGS gauge data
   at the HUC outflow points for an uncalibrated and calibrated model run
   for the period from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 1992, and a
   validation Nn for the period from January 1, 1993, through December 31,
   1995. Least squares regression of NPSM predicted flows versus USGS gauge
   data were 0.75, 0.44, and 0.69 for the calibration runs and 0.71, 0.69,
   and 0.64 for the validation runs in the Driftwood, Contentnea, and
   Ichawaynochaway HUCs, respectively. Nash Sutcliffe coefficient values
   were not as strong, ranging from -0.66 to 0.45 for the calibration runs
   and 0.31 to 0.37 for the validation runs of the model. The
   Ichawaynochaway HUC proved the most difficult to calibrate indicating
   that the model may not be as useful in some geographic locations.}},

Abstract = {{Three investigations are underway, as part of the U.S. Geological
   Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program, to study the
   relation between varying levels of urban intensity in drainage basins
   and in-stream water quality, measured by physical, chemical, and
   biological factors. These studies are being conducted in the vicinities
   of Boston (Massachusetts), Salt Lake City (Utah), and Birmingham
   (Alabama), areas where rapid urbanization is occurring. For each study,
   water quality will be sampled in approximately 30 drainage basins that
   represent a gradient of urban intensity. This paper focuses on the
   methods used to characterize and select the basins used in the studies.
   It presents a methodology for limiting the variability of natural
   landscape characteristics in the potential study drainage basins and for
   ranking the magnitude of human influence, or urbanization, based on land
   cover, infrastructure, and socioeconomic data in potential study basins.
   Basin characterization efforts associated with the Boston study are
   described for illustrative purposes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes how a hydrologic model proved to be a valuable tool
   to help interested parties understand impacts to four threatened and
   endangered fish species in the Upper Colorado River. In 1994, the Ute
   Water Conservancy District initiated permitting and design of the
   Plateau Creek pipeline replacement. The project was considered a major
   Federal action and therefore subject to the National Environmental
   Policy Act. Under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish
   and Wildlife Service (USFWS) entered the process to develop a Biological
   Opinion (BO) and determined that the project could potentially impact
   the endangered fish in the 15-mile reach of the Colorado River. The
   Section 7 consultation was directed by a Core Committee comprised of
   stakeholders in the Upper Colorado River watershed. Hydrologic modeling
   became the evaluation tool for comparing flow reductions to USFWS target
   recovery flows and defining make-up flow requirements to meet those
   targets. The Colorado River Recovery Implementation Program was
   designated to provide the make-up flows. The USFWS released a final BO
   in December 1997, approving diversions through 2015. An Environmental
   Impact Statement for the project was completed and the Record of
   Decision was issued by the Bureau of Land Management in early 1998.}},

Abstract = {{Successful restoration of declining anadromous species is dependent upon
   effective riparian buffer zone management. Natural resource managers,
   policy developers and local conservation groups require science-based
   information concerning the width at which a given buffer will be
   effective for its stated purpose. This paper summarizes a method
   developed in 1999 to determine effective riparian buffer widths for
   Atlantic salmon habitat protection as part of the Atlantic Salmon
   Conservation Plan for Seven Maine Rivers. A major assumption of the
   method is that no two buffers are alike with respect to their
   effectiveness and that various buffer characteristics dictate the
   required width for a given level of effectiveness. The method uses a
   predictive model that generates suggested riparian buffer widths as a
   function of specific, measurable buffer characteristics (such as slope,
   soil characteristics, and plant community structure and density) that
   affect buffer function. The method utilizes a variable-width, two-zone
   approach and specifies land uses that are consistent with desired buffer
   function within the two zones.}},

Abstract = {{The Umatilla River Basin Fisheries Restoration Plan was initiated in the
   early 1980s to mitigate salmonid losses caused by hydroelectric
   development and habitat degradation. The objectives are to enhance the
   abundance of endemic steelhead and reintroduce extirpated chinook and
   coho salmon. The project prompted collaborative effort among federal,
   state, and tribal agencies, and local water users. It has incorporated
   habitat restoration, flow enhancement, fish passage improvements, and
   population supplementation through artificial production. Water
   exchanges have successfully increased minimum flows during spring and
   fall migration. While flows remain depressed compared to historic
   conditions, there is potential for improved habitat, passage, and
   homing. The mean adult-to-adult return rate of hatchery-reared steelhead
   exceeded replacement and that of the naturally-spawning population.
   Although the smelt-to-adult survival rates of hatchery-reared fish
   fluctuate, salmonid escapement has increased in recent years, permitting
   steelhead and spring chinook harvest. Enumeration of potential spawners
   and observed redds reveals an increase in natural production of all
   supplemented species. Comparison of hatchery-reared and
   naturally-spawning steelhead populations revealed differences in life
   history characteristics (in age composition and sex ratios) though run
   timing and genetic stock compositions of the two components of the
   populations have not differed. Sustained monitoring is needed to
   determine benefits of integrating habitat restoration and artificial
   production in restoring salmonid populations.}},

Abstract = {{Growing-season evapotranspiration and surface energy and water balances
   were investigated for an extensive, bulrush-dominated wetland in the
   Upper Klamath National Wildlife Refuge of south-central Oregon, a
   semi-arid region with competing demands for scarce water resources.
   Turbulent fluxes of sensible and latent heat were measured by eddy
   covariance for 1.2 to 1.9 days during each of four site visits during
   late-May to mid-October 1997. Mean daytime latent heat flux and the
   Bowen ratio ranged from 148 to 178 W m(-2) and from 0.38 to 0.51,
   respectively, during late May, mid-July, and late August site visits. By
   mid-October, when the plant canopy had senesced, daytime latent heat
   flux and the Bowen ratio averaged 46 W m(-2) and 2.8, respectively. An
   hourly Penman-Monteith (PM) model that was fitted to the surface-flux
   data provided values for the surface resistance to water-vapor diffusion
   that ranged from 78 s m(-1) during late August to 206 s m(-1) during
   mid-October. Similarly, a Priestley-Taylor (PT) model provided values
   for the PT multiplier (alpha) that ranged from 0.96 during late August
   to 0.37 during mid-October The PM and PT models predicted
   evapotranspiration totals of 560 and 480 mm, respectively, for May 28 to
   October 12, 1997.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has compiled a national retrospective
   data set of analyses of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ground
   water of the United States. The data are from Federal, State, and local
   nonpoint-source monitoring programs, collected between 1985-95. This
   data set is being used to augment data collected by the USGS National
   Water-Quality Assessment (NAmTQA) Program to ascertain the occurrence of
   VOCs in ground water nationwide. Eleven attributes of the retrospective
   data set were evaluated to determine the;suitability of the data to
   augment NAWQA data in answering occurrence questions of varying
   complexity. These II attributes are the VOC analyte list and the
   associated reporting levels for each VOC, well type, well-casing
   material, type of openings in the interval (screened interval or open
   hole), well depth, depth to the top-and bottom of the open interval(s),
   depth to-water level in the well, aquifer type (confined or unconfined),
   and aquifer lithology. VOCs frequently analyzed included solvents,
   industrial reagents, and refrigerants, but other VOCs of current
   interest were not frequently analyzed.
   About 70 percent of the sampled wells have the type of well documented
   in the data set, and about 74 percent have well depth documented.
   However, the data set generally lacks documentation of other
   characteristics, such as well-casing material, information about the
   screened or open interval(s), depth to water level in the well, and
   aquifer type and lithology. For example, only about 20 percent of the
   wells include information on depth to water level in the well and only
   about 14 percent of the wells include information about aquifer type.
   The three most important enhancements to VOC data collected in
   nonpoint-source monitoring programs for use in a national assessment of
   VOC occurrence in ground water would be an expanded VOC analyte List,
   recording the reporting level for each analyte for every analysis, and
   recording key ancillary information about each well. These enhancements
   would greatly increase the usefulness of VOC data in addressing complex
   occurrence questions, such as those that seek to explain the reasons for
   VOC occurrence and nonoccurrence in ground water of the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Using a genetic algorithm (GA), optimal intermittent pumping schedules
   were established to simulate pump-and-treat remediation of a
   contaminated aquifer with known hydraulic limitations and a water
   miscible contaminant, located within the Duke Forest in Durham, North
   Carolina. The objectives of the optimization model were to minimize
   total costs, minimize health risks,and maximize the amount of
   contaminant removed from the aquifer. Stochastic ground water and
   contaminant transport models were required to provide estimates of
   contaminant concentrations at pumping wells. Optimization model
   simulations defined a tradeoff curve between the pumping cost and the
   amount of contaminant extracted from the aquifer. For this specific
   aquifer/miscible contaminant combination, the model simulations
   indicated that pump-and-treat remediation using intermittent pumping
   schedules for each pumping well produced significant reductions in
   predicted contaminant concentrations and associated health risks at a
   reasonable cost, after a remediation time of two years.}},

Abstract = {{We measured the base-flow stream chemistry in all the major
   physiographic provinces of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin. The
   spatial variation of stream chemistry was closely related to differences
   in geology and land cover among the sampled water-sheds. Some stream
   chemistry variables were strongly affected by geological settings in the
   watersheds while others were more influenced by land cover. The effects
   of land cover differed among chemical constituents and regions.
   Concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, pH, total alkalinity, and conductivity
   were mainly functions of carbonate bedrock, especially in the Great
   Valley. Nitrate-N and total dissolved N were closely related to cropland
   and increased as the percentage of cropland increased. The rate of
   increase varied from region to region with the highest in the Piedmont.
   Na+ and Cl-were mainly affected by the percentage of developed area in a
   watershed, especially in the Coastal Plain and Piedmont. We observed no
   significant effects of region or land cover on species of phosphorus
   because samples were collected under base now conditions and only
   dissolved forms were measured. Dissolved silicate (DSi) was not related
   to any other water chemistry variables. DSi increased as developed area
   decreased and cropland increased in the Coastal Plain, but these
   patterns were reversed in the Piedmont. There was no consistent pattern
   in the spatial variation of land cover effects on the reduced forms of
   N, dissolved organic P, dissolved organic matter, and K+.}},

Abstract = {{Interpretation of ground water level changes in a developed aquifer
   usually relies on reference to some benchmark such as
   ``predevelopment{''} ground water levels, changes from fall to fall
   and/or spring to spring, or to determination of maximum stress during
   the pumping season. The assumption is that ground water levels measured
   in the monitoring well accurately reflect the state of the ground water
   resource in terms of quantity in storage and the effects of local
   pumping. This assumption is questionable based on the patterns shown in
   continuous hydrographs of water levels in monitoring wells in Nebraska,
   and wells installed to determine vertical gradients. These hydrographs
   show clear evidence for vertical ground water gradients and recharge
   from overlying parts of the aquifer system to deeper zones in which
   production wells are screened. The classical concept of semi-perched
   ground water, as described by Meinzer, is demonstrated by these
   hydrographs. The presence of semi-perched ground water (Meinzer
   definition, there is no intervening unsaturated zone) invalidates the
   use of measured ground water levels in regional observation programs for
   detailed numerical management of the resource. Failure to recognize the
   Meinzer effect has led to faulty management. The best use of data from
   the observation well network would be for detection of trends and
   education unless it is clearly understood what is being measured.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient data from all available sources for the lower Mississippi River
   were examined for potential differences among sampling agencies and
   geographic locations for the period between 1960 and 1998. Monthly means
   grouped by parameter, sampling location and agency, were calculated and
   compared as paired sets, excluding those months where data were not
   available for both sets. Some significant differences were found between
   various agencies collecting nutrient data on the river, as well as
   between various stretches of river, especially in the case of phosphorus
   nutrient data. Results were used to synthesize data sets from which a
   history of nutrient loading in the Mississippi River was determined.
   General trends in nitrate+nitrite, total Kjeldahl nitrogen,
   orthophosphate, total phosphorus and silica loads, as well as changes in
   nutrient proportions and the specific limiting nutrient (by month) are
   reported. This study provides a useful summary of contemporary and

Abstract = {{The NRCS curve number approach to runoff estimation has traditionally
   been to average or ``lump{''} spatial variability into a single number
   for purposes of expediency and simplicity in calculations. In contrast,
   the weighted runoff curve number approach, which handles each individual
   pixel within the watershed separately tends to result in larger
   estimates of runoff than the lumped approach. This work proposes further
   enhancements that consider not only spatial variability, but also the
   orientation of this variability with respect to the flow aggregation
   pattern of the drainage network. Results show that the proposed
   enhancements lead to much reduced estimates of runoff production. A
   revised model that considers overland flow lengths, consistent with
   existing NRCS concepts is proposed, which leads to only mildly reduced
   runoff estimates. Although more physically-based, this revised model,
   which accounts directly for spatially distributed curve numbers and flow
   aggregation, leads to essentially the same results as the original,
   lumped runoff model when applied to three study watersheds.
   Philosophical issues and implications concerning the appropriateness of
   attempting to disaggregate lumped models are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments were conducted from 1992 to 1995 to estimate ground
   water recharge rates at two sites located within a 2.7-hectare
   agricultural field. The field lies in a sand plain setting in central
   Minnesota and is cropped continuously in field corn. The sites are
   located at a topographically high (upland) site and a topographically
   low (lowland) site in an effort to quantify the effects of depression
   focusing of recharge. Three site-specific methods were used to estimate
   recharge rates: well hydrograph analysis, chlorofluorocarbon age dating,
   and an unsaturated zone water balance. All three recharge methods
   indicated that recharge rates at the lowland site (annual average of all
   methods of 29 cm) exceeded those at the upland site (annual average of
   18 cm). On an annual basis, estimates by the individual methods ranged
   from 12 to 44 percent of precipitation at the upland site and from 21 to
   83 percent at the lowland site. The difference in recharge rates between
   the sites is primarily attributed to depression focusing of surface
   water runon at the lowland site. However, two other factors were also
   important: the presence of thin lamellae at the upland site, and coarser
   textured soils below a depth of 1.5 m at the lowland site.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of numerous field studies shows that nitrogen and phosphorous
   export coefficients are significantly different across forest,
   agriculture, and urban land-cover types. We used simulations to estimate
   the land-cover composition at which there was a significant risk of
   nutrient loads representative of watersheds without forest cover. The
   results suggest that at between 20 percent and 30 percent nonforest
   cover, there is a 10 percent or greater chance of N or P nutrient loads
   being equivalent to the median values of predominantly agricultural or
   urban watersheds. The methods apply to environmental management for
   assessing the risk to increased nonpoint nutrient pollution.
   Interpretation of the risk measures are discussed relative to their
   application for a single watershed and across a region comprised of
   several watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{A 12-km reach of Walnut Creek was mapped at the Neal Smith National
   Wildlife Refuge in Jasper County, Iowa to identify and prioritize areas
   of the stream channel in need of further investigation or restoration.
   Channel features, including streambank conditions, bottom sediment
   materials and thickness, channel cross-sections, debris dams, tile
   lines, tributary creeks, and cattle access points, were located to
   one-meter accuracy with global positioning system (GPS) equipment and
   described while traversing the stream. The GPS data were exported into a
   Geographic Information System (GIS) format, and field descriptions were
   added to create a series of coverages. Channel features were coupled
   with existing land cover data for analysis.
   Left and right streambank erosion rates varied from slight in many areas
   to severe at outside meander bends, debris dams or cattle access points.
   Erosion estimates from this study suggest that stream banks contribute
   about 50 percent of the annual suspended sediment load in the channel.
   Substrate materials varied from bare or thinly mantled pre-Illinoian
   till to thick silty muck (> 0.3 m) behind some debris dams and cattle
   access points. Occurrences of sand and gravel areas were generally
   restricted to cattle access areas and bridge crossings. A total of 81
   debris dams were identified in the stream channel, ranging from fallen
   trees and beaver dams to several large debris dams. Numerous tile lines
   (52 total) and tributary creeks (45 total) were mapped as contributing
   flow to the main channel. Cross-sections measured at 34 locations
   indicated Walnut Creek averages 10.64 m wide and 2.77 m deep, with the
   width and depth increasing downstream. Channelization and tile discharge
   in row crop land use areas have contributed to increased bed degradation
   and channel widening throughout the watershed.
   The results of this study indicate the effectiveness of a one-time
   detailed mapping program to characterize stream system variability and
   identify spatial relationships among many stream characteristics. Stream
   survey data are being used to model watershed conditions, identify water
   sampling points and evaluate and select appropriate channel
   rehabilitation measures.}},

Abstract = {{The probable maximum flood (PMF) currently serves as the design standard
   for many U.S. dams. Floods used for design have increased and currently
   thousands of dams in the U.S. would be overtopped and possibly fail
   using the latest calculated PMF at each dam site. Some researchers have
   suggested that modifying dams to accommodate the PMF could be wasteful.
   Objections to using the PMF for dam modification include: (1) larger
   spillway capacity may increase annual downstream flood losses, (2)
   benefit-cost ratios may be low, (3) construction accidents associated
   with dam modification may cause fatalities, and (4) the dollar amount
   spent to save lives by making dame safer is often very high. Based on
   these objections, a procedure is presented for evaluating the
   effectiveness of a proposed dam modification. A change in spillway
   design policy is recommended. Accepting the status quo at a dam that
   cannot accommodate the PMF may be the best course of action.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed measurements of soil moisture and ET in semiarid forest
   environments have not been widely reported in the literature. In this
   study, soil moisture and water balance components were measured over a
   four-year period on a semiarid ponderosa pine hillslope, with
   evapotranspiration (ET) determined as the residual of measured
   precipitation, runoff, and change in soil moisture storage. ET accounts
   for approximately 95 percent of the water budget and has a distinctly
   bimodal annual pattern, with peaks occurring after spring snowmelt and
   during the late summer monsoon season, periods that coincide with high
   soil moisture. Weekly growing season ET rates determined by the
   hillslope water balance are found to be invariably below calculated
   potential rates. Normalized ET rates are linearly correlated (r(2) =
   0.62) with soil moisture; therefore, a simple linear relation is
   proposed. Growing season soil moisture dynamics were modeled based on
   this relation. Results are in fair agreement (r(2) = 0.63) with the
   observed soil moisture data over the four growing seasons; however, for
   two dry summers with little surface runoff, much better results (r(2) >
   0.90) were obtained.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed watershed model combining kinematic wave routing, 1-D
   dynamic channel-flow routing, and 2-D diffusive overland-flow routing
   has been developed to simulate flooding and inundation levels of large
   watersheds. The study watershed was linked to a GIS database and was
   divided into an upstream mountainous area and a downstream alluvial
   plain. A kinematic wave routing was adopted at the mountainous area to
   compute the dlischarge flowing into the alluvial plain. A 1-D dynamic
   channel routing solving the St. Venant equations by the Preissmann
   method was performed for the main channel of the alluvial plain, whereas
   a 2-D overland-flow routing solving the diffusion wave equation with the
   Alternating Direction Explicit scheme was used for floodplains. The
   above two routings were connected by weir-link discharge formula. The
   parameters in the model were calibrated and independently verified by
   single-event storms. An example application of flooding/inundation
   analysis was conducted for the Taichung station and the Woozi depot
   (Taiwan High Speed Rail). Suggested inundation-proofing measures -
   including raising ground surface elevation of the station and depot and
   building a waterproofing exterior wall and their combination - were
   investigated. It was concluded that building the waterproofing exterior
   wall had a strong tendency to decrease peak inundation depth.}},

Abstract = {{For many years, a commonly used strategy for source water protection in
   Taiwan has been setting up arbitrary, fixed-width buffer zones near
   sensitive waters, such as water-supply reservoirs, and prohibiting any
   development in their watersheds. However, such regulations are now often
   viewed as infringing by the government on landowners' property rights, a
   situation that has led to citizen protests. This paper describes a
   proposed strategy that is water-quality based and uses a quantitative
   zoning approach. A reservoir's watershed is divided into several zones
   beginning from the normal water line to the divide. Different levels of
   best management practices (BMPs) are required for controlling runoff
   pollution in different zones. The layout of the management zones is
   based on a number of factors such as reservoir classification, water
   quality conditions, and physical characteristics of the watershed. The
   goal of promoting such an approach is to try to balance the needs of
   watershed development and water quality protection. A case study using
   the Tapu Reservoir Watershed in Northern Taiwan as an example for
   illustrating the proposed zoning approach is presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines water consumption characteristics in Casablanca and

   forecasts of water demand to 2010; and simulation of the effects of a
   complex of water conservation methods on the forecasted demands. The
   results indicate that residential/commercial water demand its weakly
   responsive to price changes (elasticity = -0.448) while institutional
   water demand is slightly more responsive (elasticity = -0.648). The
   conservation approaches used in the simulations included public
   education, plumbing code revisions to require use of water conservation
   devices, leak detection and repair, pricing policy, metering, and
   pressure reduction. The results indicate that considerable saving in
   water use can be attained through a comprehensive water demand

Abstract = {{Two water-quality studies were done on the outskirts of the Detroit
   metropolitan area to determine how recent residential development has
   affected ground-water quality. Pairs of monitor and domestic wells were
   sampled in areas where residential land use overlies glacial outwash
   deposits. Young, shallow waters had significantly higher median
   concentrations of nitrate, chloride, and dissolved solids than older,
   deeper waters. Analysis of chloride/bromide ratios indicates that
   elevated salinities are due to human activities rather than natural
   factors, such as upward migration of brine. Trace concentrations of
   volatile organic compounds were detected in samples from 97 percent of
   the monitor wells. Pesticides were detected infrequently even though
   they are routinely applied to lawns and roadways in the study area. The
   greatest influence on ground-water quality appears to be from
   septic-system effluent (domestic sewage, household solvents,
   water-softener backwash) and infiltration of stormwater runoff from
   paved surfaces (road salt, fuel residue). No health-related
   drinking-water standards were exceeded in samples from domestic wells.
   However, the effects of human activities are apparent in 76 percent of
   young waters, and at depths far below 25 feet, which is the current
   minimum well-depth requirement.}},

   is not only practical and useful, but also it elucidates the hydrologic
   characteristics of groundwater-dominated lakes of the Sand Hills. The
   apparent differences in behavior between lakes in the northern and

Abstract = {{An export coefficient modeling approach was used to assess the influence
   of land use on phosphorus loading to a Southern Ontario stream. A model
   was constructed for the 1995-1986 water year and calibrated within +/- 3
   percent of the observed mean concentration of total phosphorus. It was
   found that runoff from urban areas contributed most to the loading of
   phosphorus to the stream. When the model was assessed by running it for
   the 1977-1978 water year, using water quality and land use data
   collected independently, agreement within +/- 7 percent was obtained.
   The model was then used to forecast the impact of future urban
   development proposed for the watershed, in terms of phosphorus loading,
   and to evaluate the reduction in loading resulting from several urban
   best management practices (BMP). It was determined that phosphorus
   removal will have to be applied to all the urban runoff from the
   watershed to appreciably reduce stream phosphorus concentration. Of the
   BMP designs assessed, an infiltration pond system resulted in the
   greatest phosphorus load reduction, 50 percent from the 1995-1996
   baseline.}},

Abstract = {{Grazed pastures represent a potential source of nonpoint pollution. In
   comparison to other nonpoint sources (e.g., row-cropped lands),
   relatively little information exists regarding possible magnitudes of
   nutrient losses from grazed pasture, how those losses are affected by
   management variables, and how the losses can be minimized. The objective
   of this study was to measure concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus
   (P), and solids in runoff from fescue plots and relate those
   measurements to simulated forage management strategy. The study was
   conducted at the University of Kentucky Maine Chance Agricultural
   Experiment Station north of Lexington. Plots (2.4 m wide by 6.1 m long)
   were constructed and established in Kentucky 31 fescue (Festuca
   arundinacea Schreb.) to represent pasture. The experimental treatments
   applied to the plots varied in terms of forage height and material
   applied (none, manure, or manure and urine). Runoff was sampled for six
   simulated rainfall events applied over the summer of 1997 and analyzed
   for nitrate N (NO3-N), ammonia N (NH3-N), total Kjeldahl N (TKN),
   ortho-P (PO4-P), total P (TP), and total suspended solids (TSS). All
   runoff constituents exhibited dependence on the date of simulated
   rainfall with generally higher concentrations measured when simulated
   rainfall followed relatively dry periods. The effects of forage height
   and manure addition were mixed. Highest runoff N concentrations were
   associated with the greatest forage heights, whereas highest P
   concentrations occurred for the least forage heights. Manure/urine
   addition increased runoff P concentrations relative to controls (no
   manure/urine) for both the greatest and least forage heights, but runoff
   N concentrations were increased only for the greatest forage heights.
   These findings indicate that runoff of N and P is at least as sensitive
   to amount and proximity of preceding rainfall and suggest that managing
   forage to stimulate growth and plant uptake can reduce runoff of N.}},

Abstract = {{Water level data at 16 ground water wells and two sea water gauging
   stations, coupled with barometric measurements in an alluvial plain in
   the central-west region of Taiwan, are analyzed using spectral analysis
   in the time and frequency domains. The semi-diurnal component from water
   level station is observed to be the most noticeable signal while the
   diurnal component is the less distinct signal recorded at the water
   level stations. Both semidiurnal and diurnal components are coupled with
   atmospheric pressure measurements. From the atmospheric pressure data,
   spectral analysis indicates that both the raw and the pressure adjusted
   water levels are almost in phase and retain the same amplitude in this
   area. It implies that the effect of pressure variations is not
   significant for the sea water and ground water level nearby; the
   astronomical tidal components, as expected, are the main factor causing
   fluctuation of ocean water and ground water levels in the Choshuihsi

Abstract = {{Land use and surface water data for nitrogen and pesticides (1995 to
   1997) are reported for the Walnut Creek Watershed Monitoring Project,
   Jasper County Iowa. The Walnut Creek project was established in 1995 as
   a nonpoint source monitoring program in relation to watershed habitat
   restoration and agricultural management changes implemented at the Neal
   Smith National Wildlife Refuge by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The monitoring project utilizes a paired-watershed approach (Walnut and
   Squaw creeks) as well as upstream/downstream comparisons on Walnut for
   analysis and tracking of trends. From 1992 to 1997, 13.4 percent of the
   watershed was converted from row crop to native prairie in the Walnut
   Creek watershed. Including another 6 percent of watershed farmed on a
   cash-rent basis, land use changes have been implemented on 19.4 percent
   of the watershed by the, USFWS. Nitrogen and pesticide applications were
   reduced an estimated 18 percent and 28 percent in the watershed from
   land use changes.
   Atrazine was detected most often in surface water with frequencies of
   detection ranging from 76-86 percent. No significant differences were
   noted in atrazine concentrations between Walnut and Squaw Creek.
   Nitrate-N concentrations measured in both watersheds were similar; both
   basins showed a similar pattern of detection and an overall reduction in
   nitrate-N concentrations from upstream to downstream monitoring sites.
   Water quality improvements are suggested by nitrate-N and chloride
   ratios less than one in the Walnut Creek watershed and low nitrate-N
   concentrations measured in the subbasin of Walnut Creek containing the
   greatest amount of land use changes. Atrazine and nitrate-N
   concentrations from the lower portion of the Walnut Creek watershed
   (including the prairie restoration area) may be decreasing in relation
   to the upstream untreated component of the watershed. The frequencies of
   pesticide detections aha mean nitrate-N concentrations appear related to
   the percentage of row crop in the basins and subbasins.
   Although some results are encouraging, definitive water quality
   improvements have not been observed during the first three years of
   monitoring. Possible reasons include: (1) more time is needed to
   adequately detect changes; (2) the size of the watershed is too large to
   detect improvements; (3) land use changes are not located in the area of
   the watershed where they would have greatest effect; or (4) water
   quality improvements have occurred but have been missed by the project
   monitoring design. Longer-term monitoring will allow better evaluation
   of the impact of restoration activities on water quality.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper a numerical model for flood propagation in urban areas is
   proposed. It has been applied to evaluate flooding hydraulic
   characteristics in terms of potential flood elevations, depths, and
   inundated areas. Furthermore, the algorithm efficiency and the
   consequent reduced computation time allow the use of the hydraulic model
   as a part of a more complex system for civil protection actions,
   planning, and management. During flood events, the transportation
   network plays a main role both in rescuing people when they are more
   vulnerable and in moving people and materials from and toward affected
   areas. The reduced efficiency of this transportation network is
   evaluated based on a least-flood-risk path-finding algorithm. The
   results of a case study concerning the northern part of the city of
   Rome, show that the numerical model for unsteady flow in open channel
   networks achieves the proposed aims. It has proven to be able to
   describe the flood hydraulic characteristics and to be suitable for
   real-time flood emergency management in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Due to alterations in the natural drainage system over the past several
   decades and intensified agricultural practices, freshwater discharges to
   the Sebastian River, Florida, have increased substantially. As a result,
   salinity patterns in the Sebastian River and adjacent Indian River
   lagoon have been disrupted and the influx of nutrients has increased.
   Recently, the St. Johns River Water Management District has developed a
   3-D hydrodynamic and salinity model for the Sebastian River and adjacent
   Indian River to study the effects of freshwater inflows, and to set
   guidelines for management of future freshwater discharges. Freshwater
   inflows to the Sebastian River are part of the input data of the
   hydrodynamic model. Except for the downstream drainage areas, inflows
   are gaged, and the data were used for calibration of the hydrologic
   simulations. Collectively, the downstream ungaged areas constitute about
   16 percent of the total drainage area. Because of the significant
   contribution to the total drainage area, reliable estimates of
   freshwater discharges from the ungaged areas to the Sebastian River are
   needed. This case study illustrates the development of a set of model
   parameters, reflecting the hydrologic and physiographic characteristics
   of the entire region. In this context region applies to the watersheds
   located in the coastal area along the Indian River from Titusville in
   the north to Vero Beach in the south. The parameter set was first tested
   on a number of gaged drainage basins in the region, and was then applied
   to the ungaged areas.}},

Abstract = {{Published estimates of natural recharge in Las Vegas Valley range
   between 21,000 and 35,000 acre-feet per year. This study examined the
   underlying assumptions of previous investigations and evaluated the
   altitude-precipitation relationships. Period-of-record averages from
   high altitude precipitation gages established in the 1940s through the
   1990s, were used to determine strong local altitude-precipitation
   relationships that indicate new total precipitation and natural recharge
   amounts and a new spatial distribution of that recharge. This
   investigation calculated about 51,000 acre-feet per year of natural
   recharge in the Las Vegas Hydrographic Basin, with an additional 6,000
   acre-feet per year from areas tributary to Las Vegas Valley, for a total
   of 57,000 acre-feet per year. The total amount of natural recharge is
   greater than estimates from earlier investigations and is consistent
   with a companion study of natural discharge, which estimated 53,000
   acre-feet per year of outflow. The hydrologic implications of greater
   recharge in Las Vegas Valley infer a more accurate ground-water budget
   and a better understanding of ground-water recharge that will be
   represented in a ground-water model. Thus model based ground-water
   management scenarios will more realistically access impacts to the
   ground-water system.}},

Abstract = {{Urban development has compromised the quality of physical elements of
   fish habitat in low-order spawning and rearing streams. In order to
   identify where priorities should lie in stream rehabilitation, field
   surveys of a number of streams were conducted near Vancouver, British
   Columbia. All of the streams were located in watersheds which were
   urbanized approximately 20 years earlier. The study watersheds ranged
   from 5 to 77 percent total impervious area (percent TIA). The urban
   streambeds were found to have less fine material and slightly higher
   values of intragravel dissolved oxygen than in rural streams. This
   improved gravel quality is attributed to the higher peak flows generated
   by impervious areas, and the reduced recruitment of Fine material in the
   urban watersheds. Summer base flow was uniformly low when imperviousness
   was above 40 percent, evidenced by a decrease in velocity rather than
   water depth. Large woody debris (LWD) was scarce in all streams with >
   20 percent TIA. A healthy buffer zone and abundant LWD were found to
   stabilize streambanks. The introduction of LWD is considered the most
   important strategy for stream rehabilitation. Stormwater detention
   ponds, in contrast, are concluded to have few hydrological benefits if
   constructed after a stream has reached its urban equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{Discharge from flooded abandoned subsurface coal mines is considered a
   potential source for water supplies where other acceptable water sources
   are not available. The objective of this study was to develop procedures
   for determining sustainability of mine-water discharge using rainfall
   and discharge data for a case study site. The study site is located in
   southwest Virginia where Late Paleozoic sequences of sandstone, coal,
   and shale predominate. A rain gauge and a flow rate monitoring system
   were installed at the site and data were collected for a period of 100
   days. The recording period corresponded with one of the driest periods
   in recent years and, therefore, provided valuable information regarding
   the flow sustainability during baseflow conditions. From available data
   on underground mining patterns, geology, and ground water flow regimes,
   it was determined that a coal mine aquifer exhibits hydraulic
   characteristics very similar to the extremely heterogeneous systems
   observed in karst aquifers, and the mine discharge is analogous to
   springflow. Thus, techniques commonly used in karst-water systems and
   springflow analysis were used to develop rainfall/mine-discharge
   relationships. Springflow recession analysis was performed on five
   rainfall recessions and the coefficient for each recession was compared
   and interpreted in light of known geologic information. It was found
   that the recession coefficients described the mine discharge adequately
   and the mine aquifer response to a rainfall pulse was very similar to
   the response from certain ts;pes of karst aquifers. A cross-correlation
   analysis was performed to verify the results of the recession analysis
   and to develop a ``black box{''} statistical model for discharge data.
   The correlation analysis proved the validity of springflow recession
   analysis for mine discharge. The recorded data length was not adequate
   to create a statistical model, however, but a procedure was proposed for
   a statistical model that could be used with large flow records. For the
   study site, the mine discharge was found to be sustainable for a
   prolonged period of time.}},

Abstract = {{We compared watershed land-use and fish community data between the 1970s
   and 1990s in 47 small streams in southeastern Wisconsin. Our goal was to
   quantify effects of increasing urbanization on stream fishes in what had
   been a predominantly agricultural region. In the 43 test watersheds,
   mean surface coverage by agricultural lands decreased from 54 percent to
   43 percent and urban lands increased from 24 percent to 31 percent
   between 1970 and 1990. Agriculture dominated the four reference
   watersheds, but neither agriculture (65-59 percent) nor urban (4.4-4.8
   percent) land-uses changed significantly in those watersheds during the
   study period. From the 1970s to the 1990s the mean number of fish
   species for the test stream sites decreased 15 percent, fish density
   decreased 41 percent, and the index of biotic integrity (IBI) score
   dropped 32 percent. Fish community attributes at the four reference
   sites did not change significantly during the same period, although
   density was substantially lower in the 1990s. For both the 1970s and
   1990s test sites, numbers of fish species and IBI scores were positively
   correlated with watershed percent agricultural land coverage and
   negatively correlated with watershed urban land uses, as indexed by
   percent effective connected imperviousness. Numbers of fish species per
   site and IBI scores were highly variable below 10 percent
   imperviousness, but consistently low above 10 percent. Sites that had
   less than 10 percent imperviousness and fewer than 10 fish species in
   the 1970s suffered the greatest relative increase in imperviousness and
   decline in species number over the study period. Our findings are
   consistent with previous studies that have found strong negative effects
   of urban land uses on stream ecosystems and a threshold of environmental
   dam age at about 10 percent imperviousness. We conclude that although
   agricultural land uses often degrade stream fish communities,
   agricultural land impacts are generally less severe than those from
   urbanization on a per-unit-area basis.}},

Abstract = {{Severe drought is a recurring problem for the United States, as
   illustrated by widespread economic, social, and environmental impacts.
   Recent drought episodes and the widespread drought conditions in 1996,
   1998, and 1999 emphasized this vulnerability and the need for a more
   proactive, risk management approach to drought management that would
   place greater emphasis on preparedness planning and mitigation actions.
   Drought planning has become a principal tool of states and other levels
   of government to improve their response to droughts. For example, since
   1982, the number of states with drought plans has increased from 3 to
   29. Many local governments have also adopted drought or water shortage
   plans. Unfortunately, most state drought plans were established during
   the 1980s and early 1990s and emphasize emergency response or crisis
   management rather than risk management. This paper presents a
   substantive revision of a 10-step drought planning process that has been
   applied widely in the United States and elsewhere. The revised planning
   process places more weight on risk assessment and the development and
   implementation of mitigation actions and programs. The goal of this
   paper is to encourage states to adopt this planning process in the
   revision of existing drought plans or, for states without plans, in the
   development of new plans.}},

Abstract = {{Grazed pastures represent a potential source of nonpoint pollution. In
   comparison to other nonpoint sources (e.g., row-cropped lands),
   relatively little information exists regarding possible magnitudes of
   pollution from grazed pasture; how that pollution is affected by
   weather, soil, management and other variables; and how the pollution can
   be minimized. The objective of this study was to assess how the quality
   of runoff from fescue plots is influenced by duration of cattle manure
   application (4-12 weeks) and manure application strategy (none, weekly
   application of 1.4 kg/plot, and monthly application at 5.6 kg/plot).
   Additional analyses were performed to relate runoff quality to the
   timing of sample collection. The study was conducted at the University
   of Kentucky Maine Chance Agricultural Experiment Station north of
   Lexington. Plots (2.4 m wide by 6.1 m long) were constructed and
   established in Kentucky 31 fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) to
   represent pasture. Grazing was simulated by application of beef cattle
   manure to the plots. Runoff was generated by applying simulated rainfall
   approximately 4, 8 and 12 weeks following initiation of manure
   application. Runoff samples were collected and analyzed according to
   standard methods for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and fecal coliforms
   (FC). Runoff concentrations of N and P from manure-treated plots were
   low and generally not consistently different from control plot
   concentrations or related to manure application strategy. Runoff FC
   concentrations from manure-treated plots were higher than from control
   plot concentrations. Runoff concentrations of ammonia N, total Kjeldahl
   N, ortho-P and FC decreased approximately exponentially in response to
   increasing time of sample collection. These findings suggest that manure
   deposition on well-managed pasture at the rates used in this study might
   have a negligible impact on nutrient content of runoff.}},

Abstract = {{Data were collected in the fall of 1998 and the winter of 1999 from
   1,011 land owner-operators within three watersheds in the North Central
   Region of the United States to assess adoption of soil and water
   protection practices. Farm owner-operators were asked to indicate how
   frequently they used 18 different agricultural production practices.
   Many farmers within the three watersheds had adopted conservation
   protection practices. However, they also employed production practices
   that could negate many of the environmental benefits associated with
   conservation practices in use. Comparison of adoption behaviors used in
   the three watersheds revealed significant differences among the study
   groups. Respondents in the Iowa and Ohio watersheds reported greater use
   of conservation production systems than did farmers in Minnesota.
   However, there were no significant differences between Ohio and Iowa
   farmers in terms of use of conservation production practices. This was
   surprising, since farmers in the Ohio watershed had received massive
   amounts of public and private investments to motivate them to adopt and
   to continue using conservation production systems. These findings bring
   into serious question the use of traditional voluntary conservation
   programs such as those employed in the Ohio watershed. Study findings
   suggest that new policy approaches should be considered. It is argued
   that ``whole farm planning{''} should be a significant component of new
   agricultural conservation policy.}},

Abstract = {{The hypotheses that fish survival probabilities may be lower (1) at less
   than peak operating turbine efficiency; (2) at deeper entrainment depth;
   and (3) with the deployment of extended-length intake guidance screens,
   are not supported by results on yearling chinook salmon smolts
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) at Lower Granite Dam, Snake River,
   Washington. Estimated 96 h survival probabilities for the six test
   conditions ranged from 0.937 to 0.972, with the highest survival at
   turbine operating towards the lower end of its efficiency. A blanket
   recommendation to operate all Kaplan type turbines within +/- 1 percent
   of their peak. efficiency appears too restrictive. Cavitation mode
   survival (0.946) was comparable to that at peak operating efficiency
   mode (0.937), as was the survival between upper (0.947) and mid depths
   (0.937). Survival differed only slightly among three turbine intake bays
   at the same depth (0.937 to 0.954), most likely due to differential flow
   distribution. Extended-length intake fish guidance screens did not
   reduce survival. However, the sources of injury somewhat differed with
   depth; probable pressure and shear-related injuries were common on fish
   entrained at mid-depth, and mechanically-induced injuries were common at
   upper depth. Operating conditions that reduce turbulence within the
   turbine environment may enhance fish survival; however, controlled
   experiments that integrate turbine flow physics and geometry and the
   path entrained fish traverse are needed to develop specific guidance to
   further enhance fish passage survival.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology to estimate the average monthly lake evaporation,
   E(tau),(month tau = 1,12) for fresh water bodies located in the
   northeast United States is presented. The approach combines analysis of
   at-site, lake-specific vertical water temperature profile data and a
   previously developed regional air temperature based model approximation
   of the widely accepted modified Penman energy budget estimate of mean
   monthly potential evaporation, E-P(tau) (mm/day). The paper presents
   procedures to develop site-specific estimates of E-P(tau) and to convert
   water temperature data to average monthly conductive heat flux, G(tau).
   With monthly estimates of G(tau), the average monthly potential
   evaporation, E-P(tau), is then convertible to estimates of the average
   monthly lake evaporation, E(tau). This new method permits a good
   estimate of site-specific lake evaporation rates without the data and
   computational requirements of the Penman energy budget procedure nor the
   comparatively expensive, time consuming field eddy correlation approach.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland restoration activities may disturb shallow ground-water flow
   dynamics. There may be unintentional sources of water flowing into a
   constructed wetland that could compromise the long-term viability of a
   wetland function. Measurement of naturally-occurring isotopes in the
   hydrosphere can provide an indication of provenance, flow paths or
   components, and residence times or ages of wetland ground-water flow
   systems. Hydraulic head measurements may not provide sufficient detail
   of shallow flow disturbances and can be complemented by analyzing
   isotopes in waters flowing through the wetland. Two north-central
   Indiana wetlands in the Kankakee watershed are being studied to
   determine the adequacy of wetland restoration activities. The native
   LaSalle wetland and the restored Hog Marsh wetland have contrasting
   ground-water flow regimes. The conservative water isotopes O-18, H-2,
   and H-3, and selected solute isotopes C-13, C-14, N-15, S-34, Sr-87 and
   Pb206-208, demonstrate the complexity of groundwater now in Hog Marsh
   compared to the established flow regime at the LaSalle wetland.}},

Abstract = {{Data collection frequency in automated systems is user determined and
   can range from seconds to hours or days. Currently, there is no standard
   or recommended frequency interval for collecting precipitation data from
   automated systems for input to event-based models such as Green-Ampt
   Mein-Larsen (GAML). Data from 47 storm events at seven locations were
   used to simulate the response of GAML excess rainfall to temporally
   aggregated precipitation data. No difference in model efficiency was
   recognized when comparing one-minute interval data (R-2 = 1.00) to
   five-minute data (R-2 = 1.00). Very little model efficiency was lost at
   a 10-minute (R-2 = 0.96) interval. After 10-minutes, decline in
   efficiency became more rapid with R-2 = 0.16 at one hour. The combined
   effect of time interval with respect to drainage area, hydraulic
   conductivity, maximum 30-minute intensity, and total precipitation also
   revealed similar results.}},

Abstract = {{Drinking of arsenic-contaminated tubewell water has become a serious
   health threat in Bangladesh. Arsenic contaminated tubewells are believed
   to be responsible for poisoning nearly two-thirds of this country's
   population. If proper actions are not taken immediately, many people in
   Bangladesh will die from arsenic poisoning in just a few years. Causes
   and consequences of arsenic poisoning, the extent of area affected by
   it, and local knowledge and beliefs about the arsenic problem -
   including solutions and international responses to the problem - are
   analyzed. Although no one knows precisely how the arsenic is released
   into the ground water, several contradictory theories exist to account
   for its release. Initial symptoms of the poisoning consist of a dryness
   and throat constriction, difficulty in swallowing, and acute epigastric
   pain. Long-term exposure leads to skin, lung, or bladder cancer. Both
   government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Bangladesh,
   foreign governments, and international agencies are now involved in
   mitigating the effects of the arsenic poisoning, as well as developing
   cost-effective remedial measures that are affordable by the rural
   people.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the condition of drinking water provision in the United
   States documents the inequitable financial impact of environmental
   regulations on small water systems (those serving 3,300 or fewer
   people). While a variety of federal and state financial assistance
   programs are available for water systems, few quantitative analyses have
   evaluated the success of these programs in alleviating the problems of
   small systems. A case study of the largest aid initiative for water
   supply infrastructure in Pennsylvania provides the empirical framework
   through which to analyze government funding opportunities for water
   systems. This study examines the allocation practices of the
   Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (PENNVEST) to water
   systems of varying sizes. Utilizing data from PENNVEST applications and
   the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the
   distribution of PENNVEST award recipients and denied applicants by size
   characteristics are compared. The study indicates that very small water
   systems (those serving 500 or fewer) do not apply for or receive funds
   with the same frequency as their larger counterparts. Understanding the
   allocation of awards from PENNVEST offers insight into the ability of
   small communities to access capital for water supply infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is the leading cause of regional-scale nonpoint source (NPS)

   Attenuation Factor (AF) and the Leaching index (Li) are used to assess
   the near-surface leaching potential for 32 important agrochemicals for
   world average agricultural soil properties and recharge rates. The AF
   and Li indices both require the same input data and appear to work well
   for nonpolar chemicals. In the effort reported here the AF and Li
   indices produced similar results for the 32 agrochemicals. Pesticides
   with high and moderate leaching potential are identified. The AF
   estimates were more constant than the Li estimates for changes in the
   compliance depth and recharge rate. The AF index is simpler to use than
   the Li index and, therefore, is more likely to be employed in the future
   for screening/ranking agrochemicals relative to regional-scale NPS

Abstract = {{Frequency evaluation and spatial characterization of rainfall in Central
   and South Florida are presented. Point frequency analysis performed at
   all available sites has shown that the 2-parameter Gamma probability
   density function is the best model for monthly rainfall frequency over
   Central and South Florida. The model's parameters estimated at 145
   stations were used to provide monthly rainfall estimates for 10- and
   100-year dry and wet return periods. Experimental and theoretical
   variograms computed for these estimates, as well as the Kriging
   estimation variance maps, show that the existing rain gage network is
   less capable of resolving monthly rainfall variation in the wet season
   than the dry season. May is the dry-to-wet transition month, while
   October is the wet-to-dry transition month with average rainfall of 4.5
   inches. Monthly average rainfall is above 7 inches during the wet season
   and below 3 inches during the dry season. Two-thirds of the annual
   rainfall is accumulated in the wet season. Annual average rainfall is
   maximum (above 60 inches) in many areas along the east coast, and is
   minimum (below 45 inches) in many areas over Lake Okee-chobee and
   Central Florida. Rainfall maps show a changing pattern between the wet
   and the dry seasons. Frontal rainfall occurs in the dry season, while
   convective rainfall, tropical depression, and hurricanes occur in the
   wet season. Average rainfall is higher along the east coast area in the
   dry season and it is higher along the west coast area in the wet season.}},

Abstract = {{Data from 85 sites across the United States were used to estimate
   concentrations and yields of selected nutrients in streams draining
   relatively undeveloped basins. Flow-weighted concentrations during
   1990-1995 were generally low with median basin concentrations of 0.020,

   N, nitrate as N, total nitrogen, orthophosphate as P, and total
   phosphorus, respectively. The flow-weighted concentration of nitrate
   exceeded 0.6 mg/L in only three basins. Total nitrogen exceeded 1 mg/L
   in only four basins, and total phosphorus exceeded 0.1 mg/L in only four
   basins. The median annual basin yield of ammonia as N, nitrate as N,

Abstract = {{The biodegradation potential of two drinking water disinfection
   byproducts was investigated using aquifer materials obtained from
   approximately 100 and 200 meters below land surface in an aerobic
   aquifer system undergoing aquifer storage recovery of treated surface

   chloroform, was observed in aquifer microcosms under aerobic or
   anaerobic conditions. In contrast, between 16 and 27 percent
   mineralization of a radiolabeled model haloacetic acid compound,
   chloroacetic acid, was observed. These results indicate that although
   the potential for biodegradation of chloroacetic acid exists in deep
   aquifer systems, chloroform entrained within these aquifers or formed in
   situ will tend to persist. These results have important implications for
   water managers planning to meet anticipated lowered permissible levels

Abstract = {{Prior to PL95-87 little research had been conducted to determine the
   impacts of mining and reclamation practices on sediment concentrations
   and yields on a watershed scale. Furthermore, it was unknown whether
   sediment yield and other variables would return to undisturbed levels
   after reclamation. Therefore, three small watersheds, with differing
   lithologies and soils, were monitored for runoff and suspended sediment
   concentrations during three phases of watershed disturbances:
   undisturbed watershed condition, mining and reclamation disturbances,
   and post-reclaimed condition. Profound increases in suspended-sediment
   concentrations, load rates, and yields due to mining and reclamation
   activities, and subsequent drastic decreases after reclamation were
   documented. Even with increases in runoff potential, reductions in
   suspended-sediment concentrations and load rates to below or near
   undisturbed-watershed levels is possible by using the mulch-crimping
   technique and by removing diversions. Maximum concentrations and load
   rates occurred during times of active disturbances that exposed loose
   soil and spoil to high-intensity rains. Sediment concentrations remained
   elevated compared with the undisturbed watershed when diversions were
   not well maintained and overtopped, and when they were not removed for
   final reclamation. Diversions are useful for vegetation establishment,
   but should be maintained until they are removed for final reclamation
   after good vegetative cover is established.}},

Abstract = {{In early 1997, the Texas Edwards Aquifer Authority implemented a pilot
   Irrigation Suspension Program with the objectives of increasing
   springflow and providing relief to municipalities during drought.
   Irrigators were paid an average of \$234 per acre to suspend water use,
   a price higher than regional land rental rates. Auction theory and
   program implementation details suggest that the program implementation
   partially caused inflated bids. The irrigation Suspension Program is
   also compared to two alternative programs: (1) subsidizing more
   efficient irrigation technology and (2) buying land. The irrigation
   suspension is found to be more cost-effective relative to subsidizing
   improved irrigation efficiency because it can be put in place only when
   aquifer levels are low. Land purchase is a cheaper alternative if the
   bid levels remain at the levels observed.}},

Abstract = {{This project analyzes suspended sediment flux through the upper
   Barataria basin in Louisiana during the winter season defined from
   November through April. The Barataria is a shallow coastal estuary
   located in southeastern Louisiana. The controls exerted by environmental
   parameters (such as wind or atmospheric pressure) in wetlands-shallow
   bay ecosystems on transport of water and sediment were examined. Water
   samples were taken at a bayou (which serve as the inlet for flow to the
   estuary) on a regular basis. These samples were analyzed for total
   suspended solids and volatile suspended solids. Velocity, depth,
   temperature, salinity, conductivity, and meteorological measurements
   were all recorded at the time of each sampling. A multi-parameter field
   probe was employed to continually monitor turbidity, water level,
   conductivity, and temperature during frontal events. These data were
   used in a regression analysis to examine the factors that drive carbon
   nux in the region.
   Investigations have determined that synoptic climate and prevailing
   weather conditions explain much of the variations in water levels, flow
   circulation patterns, salinity, and suspended sediment. Relatively small
   amounts of sediment appear to leave the estuary during normal tidal
   activity, but winter storm fronts result in significant fluxes of
   sediment in both up-basin and down-basin directions.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to explore the validity of the old analogy
   that ``soil is like a sponge.{''} Laboratory experiments were conducted
   to measure two hydrologic properties of porous media: drainage under
   gravity, and water potential curves. A tipping bucket rain gage
   connected to a data logger was used to measure the rate at which water
   drained under the force of gravity from a trough filled with four
   saturated porous media - cellulose sponges, topsoil, peat, and a medium
   sand. Pressure plate techniques were used to determine water potential
   curves for soil materials and sponges, in terms of relative cumulative
   discharge from the trough, sponges were intermediate between peat and
   topsoil. Because of their tremendous water-holding capacity, sponges
   discharged more than 2.5 times as much water as did peat. The water
   potential curve for sponges was fairly flat, like that of topsoil, but
   the high water content across all pressures (0.30-15.0 bars) indicated
   some similarity to peat. The results of these experiments suggest that
   the general patterns of water retention and release in soil materials
   and sponges are similar and vary only in degree.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Forestation of riparian areas has long been promoted to restore stream
   ecosystems degraded by agriculture in central North America. Although
   trees and shrubs in the riparian zone can provide many benefits to
   streams, grassy or herbaceous riparian vegetation can also provide
   benefits and may be more appropriate in some situations. Here we review
   some of the positive and negative implications of grassy versus wooded
   riparian zones and discuss potential management outcomes. Compared to
   wooded areas, grassy riparian areas result in stream reaches with
   different patterns of bank stability, erosion, channel morphology, cover
   for fish, terrestrial runoff, hydrology, water temperature, organic
   matter inputs, primary production, aquatic macroinvertebrates, and fish.
   Of particular relevance in agricultural regions, grassy riparian areas
   may be more effective in reducing bank erosion and trapping suspended
   sediments than wooded areas. Maintenance of grassy riparian vegetation
   usually requires active management (e.g., mowing, burning; herbicide
   treatments, and grazing), as successional processes will tend ultimately
   to favor woody vegetation. Riparian agricultural practices that promote
   a dense, healthy, grassy turf, such as certain types of intensively
   managed livestock grazing, have potential to restore degraded stream
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Uncalculated impacts of unsustainable aquifer yield including evidence
   of subsurface interbasin flow}},

Abstract = {{Unsustainable withdrawals from regional aquifers have resulted in
   adverse impacts considerable distances from the point locations of
   supply wells. In one area of the southeastern (SE) Coastal Plain,
   conservative estimates for repair/replacement of some residential wells
   damaged or destroyed by unsustainable yield from the Floridan aquifer
   system exceeded \$4 million. However, a comprehensive assessment of
   damage/economic loss to private property and public resources due to
   unsustainable yield from that regional karat aquifer has not been made.
   Uncalculated direct costs to home-owners from damage attributed to those
   withdrawals are associated with destruction of homes from increased
   sinkhole formation, devalued waterfront property, and removal of
   diseased and dead trees. Examples of other uncalculated economic burdens
   resulting from unsustainable aquifer yield in the SE Coastal Plain
   include: (1) irreversible damage to the aquifer matrix and concomitant
   increased potential for groundwater contamination, (2) large-scale
   wildfires with subsequent degradation of air quality, debilitation of
   transportation corridors, and destruction of timber, wildlife habitat
   and property, and (3) destruction of ``protected{''} natural areas. This
   paper provides a general background of the regional Floridan aquifer
   system's karst characteristics, examples of known impacts resulting from
   ground water mining in the SE Coastal Plain, and examples of additional
   damage that may be related to unsustainable yield from the Upper
   Floridan aquifer. Costs of these impacts have not been calculated and
   are not reflected in the price users pay for ground water. Evidence
   suggests that the classic watershed management approach must be revised
   in areas with mined regional karst aquifers to include impacts of
   induced recharge from the surficial aquifer, and subsurface interbasin
   flow. Likewise, associated impacts to surface water and interrelated
   systems must be calculated The true cost of groundwater mining to this
   and future generations should be determined using a multidisciplinary
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Water policy problems are wicked, not in an ethically deplorable sense,
   but in the sense that they present us with especially difficult
   challenges of becoming more effective in our interdisciplinary
   collaboration, of integrating two very different types of knowledge, of
   working across several socio-political units of analysis simultaneously,
   and of better organizing water as a common property resource. Sociology
   as a discipline, does not have a particularly rich history of successful
   interdisciplinary collaboration on water resources research and
   teaching, but it potentially has a most useful contribution to make by
   focusing on the analysis of local common property resource organizations
   that operate in the interface between individual resource users and
   State-Federal entities. These organizations (e.g., water user
   associations, mutual companies, irrigation districts, acequias,
   conservancy districts) have been the orphans of water policy discourse
   but their operations are critical to undertaking more effective 21st
   century social analysis, research work, and action programs.
   Sociologists who work to better comprehend the operations of, and
   constraints upon, these organizations build a sociology that can better
   collaborate with other water-related disciplines in addressing the
   challenges posed by the wickedness of our water problems.}},

Abstract = {{Better Assessment Science Integrating Point and Nonpoint Sources
   (BASINS) is a geographic-based watershed assessment tool developed by
   EPA's Office of Water to help states more efficiently target and
   evaluate water-bodies that are not meeting water quality standards.
   BASINS (EPA, 1996a, 1998) brings together data on water quality and
   quantity, land uses, point source loadings, and other related spatial
   data with supporting nonpoint and water quality models at a quicker and
   more effective pace. EPA developed BASINS, to better integrate point and
   nonpoint source water quality assessments for the Nation's 2100+
   watersheds. In its zeal to achieve this endpoint, EPA has initiated a
   simplistic approach that was expected to grow through scientific
   enhancements as TMDL developers become more familiar with modeling
   requirements. BASINS builds upon federal databases of water quality
   conditions and point source loadings for numerous parameters where
   quality assurance is suspect in some cases. Its design allows
   comprehensive assessments and modeling in typical Total Maximum Daily
   Load (TMDL) computations. While the TMDL utility is the primary reason
   BASINS was developed, other longer-range water quality assessments will
   become possible as the Agency expands the suite of assessment models and
   databases in future releases. The simplistic approach to modeling and
   user-friendly tools gives rise, however, to technical and philosophical
   concerns related to default data usage. Seamless generation of model
   input files and the failure of some utilities to work properly suggest
   to NCASI that serious problems may still exist and prompts the need for
   a more rigorous peer-review. Furthermore, sustainable training becomes
   paramount, as some older modelers will be unfamiliar with Geographic
   Information System (GIS) technology and associated computer skills.
   Overall, however, BASINS was judged to be an excellent beginning tool to
   meet the complex environmental modeling needs in the 21st Century.}},

Abstract = {{Management of a regional ground water system to mitigate drought
   problems at the multi-layered aquifer system in Collier County, Florida,
   is the main topic. This paper developed a feedforward control system
   that consists of system and control equations. The system equation,
   which forecasts ground water levels using the current measurements, was
   built based on the Kalman filter algorithm associated with a stochastic
   time series model. The role of the control equation is to estimate the
   pumping reduction rate during an anticipated drought. The control
   equation was built based on the empirical relationship between the
   change in ground water levels and the corresponding pumping requirement.
   The control system starts with forecasting one-month-ahead ground water
   head at each control point. The forecasted head is in turn used to
   calculate the deviation of ground water heads from the monthly target
   specified by a 2-in-10-year frequency. When the forecasted water level
   is lower than the target, the control system computes spatially-varied
   pumping reduction rates as a recommendation for ground water users. The
   proposed control system was tested using hypothetical droughts. The
   simulation result revealed that the estimated pumping reduction rates
   are highly variable in space, strongly supporting the idea of spatial
   forecasting and controlling of ground water levels as opposed to a
   lumped water use restriction method used previously in the model area.}},

   determine the drought lead time (DLT), the time before the onset of a
   drought. A more efficient reservoir operational strategy can be
   established with the aid of DLT and the probability of successful
   drought prediction (Ps). Simulation results of reservoir operation over
   a period of three decades demonstrate that, at one month DLT, the
   kriging approach achieves 0.86 of Ps for moderate droughts and 0.94 of
   Ps for severe droughts. The kriging approach generally outperformed the
   time series approach in terms of DLT, Ps of drought prediction, and the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach for the spatially
   distributed modeling of water flow during storm events. Distributed
   modeling of flow during storm events is an important basis for any
   environmental modeling, including turbidity or sediment transport.
   During the initial phase of a rainstorm, surface runoff is the main
   contributor of flow. To provide the spatial components for distributed
   hydrological modeling a Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to
   map and visualize contributing areas around a stream channel. Stream
   segments were defined using the hydrologic response unit (HRU) concept.
   Lateral flows were derived from GIS output for each segment of the
   stream and at each time interval of the rain storm and were routed using
   the kinematic routing equation. This approach is new in hydrological
   modeling and can be used to enhance many existing simulations. The model
   is also unique in the fine time scale (i.e., intervals are on the order
   of minutes). Model results showed good correlation with measured
   discharge values; however, further studies of contributing area
   behavior, its relationship with soil types and slope categories, and the
   influence of watershed size are needed to improve model performance.
   This model will be used in the future as the basis to model turbidity in
   streams.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, storm water management programs and criteria have focused
   on quantity issues related to flooding and drainage system design.
   Traditional designs were based on large rainfall-runoff events such as
   those having two-year to 100-year return periods. While these are key
   criteria for management and control of peak flows, detention basin
   designs based on these criteria may not provide optimal quality
   treatment of storm runoff. As evidenced by studies performed by numerous
   public and private organizations, the water quality impacts of storm
   water runoff are primarily a function of more frequent rainfall-runoff
   events rather than the less frequent events that cause peak flooding.
   Prior to this study there had been no detailed investigations to
   characterize the variability of the more frequent rainfall events on
   Guam. Also, there was a need to develop some criteria that could be
   applied by designers, developers, and agency officials in order to
   reduce the impact of storm water runoff on the receiving bodies. The
   objectives of this paper were three-fold: (1) characterize the hourly
   rainfall events with respect to volume, frequency, duration, and the
   time between storm events; (2) evaluate the rainfall-runoff
   characteristics with respect to capture volume for water quality
   treatment; and (3) prepare criteria for sizing and designing of storm
   water quality management facilities. The rainfall characterization
   studies have provided insight into the characteristics of rainstorms
   that are likely to produce non-point source pollution in storm water
   runoff. By far the most significant findings are the development of a
   series of design curves that can be used in the actual sizing of storm
   water detention and treatment facilities. If applied correctly, these
   design curves could lead to a reduction of non-point source pollution to
   Guam's streams, estuaries, and coastal environments.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure using a simple, empirically-based model that makes efficient

   water monitoring well network. A moving plume is described by siting
   wells in a sequential manner, relying upon two-dimensional concentration
   data obtained from previously installed wells to determine the locations
   of future wells. Data sets from two well known, densely monitored
   natural gradient tracer studies were used to test the procedure. Plumes
   defined by all information in the original networks were compared to
   those defined by reduced networks designed by the new procedure. The new
   procedure tracked the plumes using only a portion of that information.
   The new procedure could have reduced the number of wells in the original
   tests by about 50 percent without appreciable loss of plume information
   as measured by plume location and extent and by tracer mass.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a flexible system called GIS-based Flood Information
   System (GFIS) for floodplain modeling, flood damages calculation, and
   flood information support. It includes two major components, namely
   floodplain modeling and custom designed modules. Model parameters and
   input data are gathered, reviewed, and compiled using custom designed
   modules. Through these modules, it is possible for GFIS to control the
   process of floodplain modeling, presentation of simulation results, and
   calculation of flood damages. Empirical stage-damage curves are used to
   calculate the flood damages. These curves were generated from
   stage-damage surveys of anthropogenic structures, crops, etc., in the
   coastal region of a frequently flooded area in Chia-I County, Taiwan.
   The average annual flood damages are calculated with exceedance
   probability and flood damages for the designed rainfalls of 2, 5, 10,
   25, 50, 100, and 200 year recurrence intervals with a duration of 24
   hours. The average annual flood depth in this study area can also be
   calculated using the same method. The primary advantages of GFIS are its
   ability to accurately predict the locations of flood area, depth, and
   duration; calculate flood damages in the floodplain; and compare the
   reduction of flood damages for flood mitigation plans.}},

Abstract = {{The widely available USGS 7.5-minute Digital Elevation Model (DEM) has a

   aggregated into coarse-resolution areal units, termed grids, and a
   method to approximate flow direction for coarse-resolution grids from 30
   m DEM cells was developed. The method considers the flow path defined
   from the fine-resolution DEM in determining a grid's flow direction and
   makes flow directions for grids closely follow the flow pattern
   suggested by the DEM. The aggregation method was applied to a DEM of
   Goodwater Creek, a nearly flat watershed that is located in central

Abstract = {{Enforceable standards play a crucial role in the design and
   implementation of most water quality policies. The impacts of these
   standards an farm income and nonpoint source (NPS) pollution can provide
   valuable information to develop economic policies that can improve water
   quality with minimal loss in income and minimal risk. This study uses an
   integration of nonlinear programming and a simulation model to assess
   the impacts of enforceable standards at technology and farm boundary
   levels. The results indicate that the type of pollutant regulated,
   enforcement type, and the level of standard had a significant impact on
   farm income and water quality. Choice of farm boundary standards over
   technology standards is dependent on the impact of the policy on other
   NPS pollutants, in addition to the reduction of nitrate and phosphorus
   pollutants. Enforcing farm boundary standards on nitrates had desirable
   effects on subsurface and percolate nitrogen and variance in income.
   Technology standards were uncertain in their effects because of the
   restriction on the choice of technologies available to farmers. A
   comparative policy analysis considering incentives, multiple impacts,
   transaction costs of implementation, and regional consideration is
   important to an effective policy design.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed to simulate
   fluctuations in midspan water table depths (WTD) given rainfall,
   potential evapotranspiration, and irrigation inputs on a Brookston clay
   loam in Woodslee, Ontario, having a dual-purpose subsurface
   drainage/subirrigation setup. Water table depths and meteorologic data
   collected at this site from 1992 to 1994 and from 1996 to 1997 were used
   to train the ANNs. The ANNs were then used for real-time control and
   time series simulations. The lowest root mean squared errors (RMSE) for
   the various ANNs were 60.6 mm for real-time control simulation, and 88.4
   mm for time-series simulation of water table depths. It was possible to
   simulate WTD for the different modes of water table management in one
   network by incorporating an indicator for switching from one to the
   other. The ANN simulations were quite good even though the training data
   sets had irregular measurement intervals. With fewer input parameters
   and small network structures, ANNs still provided accurate results and
   required little time for training and execution. ANNs are therefore
   easier and faster to develop and run than conventional models and can
   contribute to the proper management of subsurface drainage and
   subirrigation systems.}},

Abstract = {{We examined hydrogeochemical records for a dozen watersheds in and near
   Kejimkujik National Park in southwestern Nova Scotia by relating stream
   ion concentrations and fluxes to atmospheric deposition, stream type
   (lake inlet versus outlet; brown versus clear water), and watershed type
   (catchment area, topography, soils, and dominant forest cover type). We
   found that fog and dry deposition make important contributions to S, N,
   Cl, H, Ca, Mg, K, and Na inputs into these watersheds. Seasalt chloride
   deposition from rain, snow, fog, and dry deposition equal total stream
   outputs on a region-wide basis. Chloride outputs, however, differ among
   watersheds by a factor of about two, likely due to local differences in
   air now and vegetational fog interception. We found that most of the
   incoming N is absorbed by the vegetation, as stream water NO3- and NH4+
   are very low. Our results also show that the vegetation and the soils
   absorb about half of the incoming SO4-2. In comparison with other North
   American watersheds with similar forest vegetation, Ca outputs are low,
   while Mg and K outputs are similar to other regions. Soil exchangeable
   Ca and soil cation exchange capacity are also very low. We found that
   first-order forest streams with no upstream lakes have a distinct
   seasonal pattern that neither corresponds with the seasonal pattern of
   atmospheric deposition, nor with the seasonal pattern of downstream lake
   outlets.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of the Neosho River channel downstream from John Redmond
   Dam, in southeast Kansas, was investigated using multiple-date aerial
   photographs and stream-gage information. Bankfull channel width was used
   as the primary indicator variable to assess pre- and post-dam channel
   change. Five six-mile river reaches and four stream gages were used in
   the analysis. Results indicated that, aside from some localized channel
   widening, the overall channel change has been minor with little post-dam
   change in bankfull channel width. The lack of a pronounced post-dam
   channel change may be attributed to a substantial reduction in the
   magnitude of the post-dam annual peak discharges in combination with the
   resistance to erosion of the bed and bank materials. Also, the channel
   may have been overwidened by a series of large floods that predated
   construction of the dam, including one with an estimated 500-year
   recurrence interval.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of sediment physical characteristics, sediment
   phosphorus (P) pools, and laboratory-based rates of P release from the
   sediments were used to identify regions and dosage for alum treatment in
   Wind Lake, Wisconsin. Using variations in sediment moisture content, we
   identified an erosional zone at depths < 1.4 m and an accumulation zone
   at depths > 2.6 m. Mean concentrations of porewater P, loosely-bound P,
   iron- and aluminum-bound P, and mean rates of P release from sediments
   under anoxic conditions were high in the accumulation zone compared to
   sediment P characteristics in the erosional zone, indicating focusing of
   readily mobilized sediment P pools from shallow regions and accumulation
   to deep regions. We determined that a future alum treatment for control
   of internal P loading would be most effective at depths > 2.6 in the
   accumulation zone. The mean rate of anoxic P release from sediments
   encountered in the accumulation zone (8.3 mg m(-2) d(-1)) was used in
   conjunction with a summer anoxic period of 122 d, and a treatment area
   of 1.6 km(2) to estimate an internal P load of 1,600 kg to be
   controlled. Our results suggest that an understanding of the
   distribution of sediment P pools and P fluxes in lakes provides a
   strategy for estimating alum dosage and application areas.}},

Abstract = {{In the December 1999 JAWRA Special Issue on Water Resources and Climate
   Change, Miller et al., presented an overview of downscaled climate and
   streamflow study of the southwestern United States. This manuscript
   included an initial sensitivity study of a doubled atmospheric carbon
   dioxide concentration on western U.S. precipitation and streamflow. In
   the published manuscript, Figure 12a shows the mean annual precipitation
   for 1981 to 1984 and Figure 15 shows the mean annual precipitation
   difference between the downscaled control simulation and the 2xCO(2)
   projection. Both Figure 12a and Figure 15 are in units of mm/month.
   These units are incorrect, the correct units are mm/year. An additional
   California watershed is included here, as is more analysis of the
   streamflow result due to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change is examined from the perspective of its relevancy
   and urgency as a public policy issue. Interpreting from literature
   specific to investigations into public awareness and concern, climate
   change is seen as a legitimate though less than urgent issue. The
   literature reveals that the general public holds surprising
   misconceptions about the processes contributing to climate change,
   including failure to grasp the fundamental connection to CO2 General
   ambivalence is also suggested from the results of two surveys conducted
   by The Groundwater Foundation. They first asked participants in a recent
   Groundwater Guardian Conference to rate levels of discussion and concern
   for water resources implications in the participants' communities. A
   second survey polled national water resource organizations about the
   extent climate change has been a focus of their educational,
   investigative, or advocacy efforts. The paper concludes by describing
   basic barriers to stimulating public response to climate change, which
   education about the issue should address, and by offering a model to
   educate and involve citizens based on the Groundwater Guardian program
   developed by the The Groundwater Foundation.}},

   from many different sources, among which are complex institutional
   arrangements, significant areal and temporal climatic variability, and
   high urban growth rates. Further challenges to managing supply and
   demand in this water-scarce region are posed by environmental, social,
   and legal differences within and between the individual urban areas.
   Analysis of the sensitivity of the urban water sector in the Southwest
   to climatic variability requires careful consideration of these factors.
   Such analysis, in turn, provides an essential foundation for effective

Abstract = {{It has been well established that the greenhouse gas loading of the
   atmosphere has been increasing since the mid 19th century. Consequently,
   shifts in the earth's radiative balance are expected with accompanying
   alterations to the earth's climate. With these anticipated, and perhaps
   already observable, changes in both global and regional climate,
   managers of regional water resources seek insight to the possible
   impacts climate change may have on their present and future water
   supplies. The types and degrees of impacts that climate change may have
   on New York City's water supply system were assessed in a study of a
   watershed at Allaben, New York. Hypothetical scenarios of future climate
   and climate change projections from three General Circulation Models
   (GCMs) were used in conjunction with the WatBal hydrological model and
   the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) to ascertain how runoff and
   soil moisture from this watershed may change in a warmer climate. For
   the worst case predictions, the results indicate that within the century
   of the 2000s, the watershed's air temperature may increase up to about
   11 degrees F, while its precipitation and runoff may decrease by about
   13 and 30 percent, respectively. If this watershed is typical of the
   others within the New York City water supply system, the system's
   managers should consider implementing mitigation and adaptation
   strategies in preparation for the worst of these possible future
   conditions.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{293-303}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need for water regulations in states traditionally
   managed by the riparian doctrine. Several states have passed water laws
   to control withdrawals from streams. Few, if any, however, have set up
   consistent and defensible methods for allocating water to users. This
   paper explores several methods for such allocations, examining each in
   detail and offering numerical examples that compare each on the basis of
   economic efficiency and effectiveness for maintaining critical
   streamflow standards. This work is part of a study to assess the
   vulnerability of Midwestern streams to climate change and, especially,
   surface supplied irrigation spawned by such climate change. The results
   suggest that it is possible to implement regulations that at once (I)
   are consistent with the riparian doctrine; (2) control the hydrological
   and ecological impacts of offstream withdrawals effectively; and (3)
   preserve the primary economic functions of those withdrawals, including
   minimizing economic risk. The results Further suggest that trading of
   water permits improves the latter two objectives, but only if both the
   regulatory system and permit are well-designed. On the other hand, in
   the absence of regulations, or under poorly designed regulations,
   streamflows, and therefore aquatic ecosystems, could be quite
   vulnerable.}},

Abstract = {{The vulnerability of wetlands to changes in climate depends on their
   position within hydrologic landscapes. Hydrologic landscapes are defined
   by the flow characteristics of ground water and surface water and by the
   interaction of atmospheric water, surface water, and ground water for
   any given locality or region. Six general hydrologic landscapes are
   defined; mountainous, plateau and high plain, broad basins of interior
   drainage, riverine, flat coastal, and hummocky glacial and dune.
   Assessment of these landscapes indicate that the vulnerability of all
   wetlands to climate change fall between two extremes: those dependent
   primarily on precipitation for their water supply are highly vulnerable,
   and those dependent primarily on discharge from regional ground water
   flow systems are the least vulnerable, because of the great buffering
   capacity of large ground water flow systems to climate change.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Wetlands exist in a transition zone between aquatic and terrestrial
   environments which can be altered by subtle changes in hydrology.
   Twentieth century climate records show that the United States is
   generally experiencing a trend towards a wetter, warmer climate; some
   climate models suggest that this trend will continue and possibly
   intensify over the next 100 years. Wetlands that are most likely to be
   affected by these and other potential changes (e.g., sea-level rise)
   associated with atmospheric carbon enrichment include permafrost
   wetlands, coastal and estuarine wetlands, peatlands, alpine wetlands,
   and prairie pothole wetlands. Potential impacts range from changes in
   community structure to changes in ecological function, and from
   extirpation to enhancement. Wetlands (particularly boreal peatlands)
   play an important role in the global carbon cycle, generally
   sequestering carbon in the form of biomass, methane, dissolved organic
   material and organic sediment. Wetlands that are drained or partially
   dried can become a net source of methane and carbon dioxide to the
   atmosphere, serving as a positive biotic feedback to global warming.
   Policy options for minimizing the adverse impacts of climate change on
   wetland ecosystems include the reduction of current anthropogenic
   stresses, allowing for inland migration of coastal wetlands as sea-level
   rises, active management to preserve wetland hydrology, and a wide range
   of other management and restoration options.}},

Abstract = {{The potential impacts of climate change on water yield are examined in
   the Upper Wind River Basin. This is a high-elevation, mountain basin
   with a snowfall/snowmelt dominated streamflow hydrograph. A variety of
   physiographic conditions are represented in the rangeland, coniferous
   forests, and high-elevation alpine regions. The Soil Water Assessment
   Tool (SWAT) is used to model the baseline input time series data and
   climate change scenarios. Five hydroclimatic Variables (temperature,
   precipitation, CO2, radiation, and humidity) are examined using
   sensitivity tests of individual and coupled variables with a constant
   change and coupled variables with a monthly change. Results indicate
   that the most influential Variable on annual water yield is
   precipitation; and, the most influential variable on the timing of
   streamflow is temperature. Carbon dioxide, radiation, and humidity each
   noticeably impact water yield, but less significantly. The coupled
   variable analyses represent a more realistic climate change regime and
   reflect the combined response of the basin to each variable; for
   example, increased temperature offsets the effects of increased
   precipitation and magnifies the effects of decreased precipitation. This
   paper shows that the hydrologic response to climate change depends
   largely on the hydroclimatic variables examined and that each variable
   has a unique effect (e.g., magnitude, timing) on water yield.}},

Abstract = {{Federal parks and other public lands have unique mandates and rules
   regulating their use and conservation. Because of variation in their
   response to local, regional, and globalscale disturbance, development of
   mitigation strategies requires substantial research in the context of
   long-term inventory and monitoring. In 1982, the National Park Service
   began long-term, watershed-level studies in a series of national parks.
   The objective was to provide a more comprehensive database against which
   the effects of global change and other issues could be quantified. A
   subset of five sites in North Carolina, Texas, Washington, Michigan, and
   Alaska, is examined here. During the last 50 years, temperatures have
   declined at the southern sites and increased at the northern sites with
   the greatest increase in Alaska. Only the most southern site has shown
   an increase in precipitation amount. The net effect of these trends,
   especially for the most northern and southern sites, would likely be an
   increase in the growing season and especially the time soil processes
   could continue without moisture or temperature limitations. During the
   last 18 years, there were few trends in atmospheric ion inputs. The most
   evident was the decline in SO42- deposition. There were no significant
   relationships between ion input and stream water output. This finding
   suggests other factors as modification of precipitation or canopy
   throughfall by soil processes, hydrologic flow path, and snowmelt rates
   are major processes regulating stream water chemical outputs.}},

Abstract = {{Data from long-term ecosystem monitoring and research stations in North
   America and results of simulations made with interpretive models
   indicate that changes in climate (precipitation and temperature) can
   have a significant effect on the quality of surface waters. Changes in
   water quality during storms, snowmelt, and periods of elevated air
   temperature or drought can cause conditions that exceed thresholds of
   ecosystem tolerance and, thus, lead to water-quality degradation. If
   warming and changes in available moisture occur, water-quality changes
   will likely first occur during episodes of climate-induced stress, and
   in ecosystems where the factors controlling water quality are sensitive
   to climate variability. Continued climate stress would increase the
   frequency with which ecosystem thresholds are exceeded and thus lead to
   chronic water-quality changes. Management strategies in a warmer climate
   will therefore be needed that are based on local ecological thresholds
   rather than annual median condition. Changes in land use alter
   biological, physical, and chemical processes in watersheds and thus
   significantly alter the quality of adjacent surface waters; these direct
   human-caused changes complicate the interpretation of water-quality
   changes resulting from changes in climate, and can be both mitigated and
   exacerbated by climate change. A rigorous strategy for integrated,
   long-term monitoring of the ecological and human factors that control
   water quality is necessary to differentiate between actual and perceived
   climate effects, and to track the effectiveness of our environmental
   policies.}},

Abstract = {{There are increasing concerns in the forestry community about global
   climate change and variability associated with elevated atmospheric CO2
   Changes in precipitation and increases in air temperature could impose
   additional stress on forests during the next century. For a study site
   in Carteret County, North Carolina, the General Circulation Model,
   HADCM2, predicts that by the year 2099, maximum air temperature will
   increase 1.6 to 1.9 degrees C, minimum temperature will increase 2.5 to
   2.8 degrees C, and precipitation will increase 0 to 10 percent compared
   to the mid-1990s. These changes vary from season to season. We utilized
   a forest ecosystem process model, PnET-II, for studying the potential
   effects of climate change on drainage outflow, evapotranspiration, leaf
   area index (LAI) and forest Net Primary Productivity (NPP). This model
   was first validated with long term drainage and LAI data collected at a
   25-ha mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda. L.) experimental watershed
   located in the North Carolina lower coastal plain. The site is flat with
   poorly drained soils and high groundwater table. Therefore, a high field
   capacity of 20 cm was used in the simulation to account for the
   topographic effects. This modeling study suggested that future climate
   change would cause a significant increase of drainage (6 percent) and
   forest productivity (2.5 percent). Future studies should consider the
   biological feedback (i.e., stomata conductance and water use efficiency)
   to air temperature change.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Plains of the United States, drained primarily by the Missouri
   River, are very sensitive to shifts in climate. The six main stem dams
   on the Missouri River control more than one-half of the nearly 1.5
   million square kilometer basin and can store three times the annual
   inflow from upstream. The dams are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers using a Master Manual that describes system priorities and
   benefits. The complex operational rules were incorporated into the Soil
   and Water Assessment Tool computer model (SWAT). SWAT is a distributed
   parameter raintfall-runoff model capable of simulating the transpiration
   suppression effects of CO2 enrichment. The new reservoir algorithms were
   calibrated using a 25-year long historic record of basin climate and
   discharge records. Results demonstrate that it is possible to
   incorporate the operation of a highly regulated river system into a
   complex rainfall-runoff model. The algorithms were then tested using
   extreme climate scenarios indicative of a prolonged drought, a short
   drought, and a ten percent increase in basin-wide precipitation. It is
   apparent that the rules for operating the reservoirs will likely require
   modification if, for example, upper-basin precipitation were to increase
   only ten percent under changed climate conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Simulated daily precipitation, temperature, and runoff time series were
   compared in three mountainous basins in the United States: (1) the
   Animas River basin in Colorado, (2) the East Fork of the Carson River
   basin in Nevada and California, and (3) the Cle Elum River basin in
   Washington State. Two methods of climate scenario generation were
   compared: delta change and statistical downscaling. The delta change
   method uses differences between simulated current and future climate
   conditions from the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research
   (HadCM2) General Circulation Model (GCM) added to observed time series
   of climate variables. A statistical downscaling (SDS) model was
   developed for each basin using station data and output from the National
   Center for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric
   Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis regridded to the scale of HadCM2. The
   SDS model was then used to simulate local climate variables using HadCM2
   output for current and future conditions. Surface climate variables from
   each scenario were used in a precipitation-runoff model. Results from
   this study show that, in the basins tested, a precipitation-runoff model
   can simulate realistic runoff series for current conditions using
   statistically downscaled NCEP output. But, use of downscaled HadCM2
   output for current or future climate assessments are questionable
   because the GCM does not produce accurate estimates of the surface
   variables needed for runoff in these regions. Given the uncertainties in
   the GCMs ability to simulate current conditions based on either the
   delta change or downscaling approaches, future climate assessments based
   on either of these approaches must be treated with caution.}},

   coastal activities. The assessment begins by identifying and elucidating
   the natural patterns of climate variability in the PNW on interannual to
   decadal timescales. The pathways through which these climate variations
   are manifested and the resultant impacts on the natural and human
   systems of the region are investigated. Knowledge of these pathways
   allows an analysis of the potential impacts of future climate change, as
   defined by IPCC climate change scenarios. In this paper, we examine the
   sensitivity, adaptability and vulnerability of hydrology and water
   resources to climate variability and change. We focus on the Columbia
   River Basin, which covers approximately 75 percent of the PNW and is the
   basis for the dominant water resources system of the PNW. The water
   resources system of the Columbia River is sensitive to climate
   variability, especially with respect to drought. Management inertia and
   the lack of a centralized authority coordinating all uses of the
   resource impede adaptability to drought and optimization of water
   distribution. Climate change projections suggest exacerbated conditions
   of conflict between users as a result of low summertime streamflow
   conditions. An understanding of the patterns and consequences of
   regional climate variability is crucial to developing an adequate
   response to future changes in climate.}},

Abstract = {{Daily-to-weekly discharge during the snowmelt season is highly
   correlated among river basins in the upper elevations of the central and
   southern Sierra Nevada (Carson, Walker, Tuolumne, Merced, San Joaquin,
   Kings, and Kern Rivers). In many cases, the upper Sierra Nevada
   watershed operates in a single mode (with varying catchment amplitudes).
   In some years, with appropriate lags, this mode extends to distant
   mountains. A reason for this coherence is the broad scale nature of
   synoptic features in atmospheric circulation which provide anomalous
   insolation and temperature forcings that span a large region, sometimes
   the entire western U.S. These correlations may fall off dramatically,
   however, in dry years when the snowpack is spatially patchy.}},

Abstract = {{Literatures on price-based urban water conservation and on market-based
   mechanisms to manage natural resources suggest that market-based
   management of urban/suburban water use may be feasible. A market-based
   proposal that emerged from a water shortage on California's Monterey
   Peninsula is presented. In the proposal, conservation incentives arise
   both from an ability among end-users of water to reduce consumption and
   sell use-rights to water, and from a penalty price for consumption in
   excess of one's use rights. The amount of water associated with use
   rights is capped and varies according to hydrological, meteorological,
   ecological, and other criteria. Requirements for further study of the
   proposal are listed, and the role that similar market-based mechanisms
   could play in urban water management is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{More than 300 landslides and debris flows were triggered by an October
   1993 storm on Prince of Wales Island, southeast Alaska. Initiation,
   runout, and deposition patterns of landslides that occurred within
   clearcuts, second-growth, and old-growth forests were examined. Blowdown
   and snags, associated with cedar decline and ``normal{''} rates of
   mortality, were found adjacent to at least 75 percent of all failures
   regardless of land use, Nearly 50 percent of the landslides within
   clearcuts occurred within one year following timber harvest; more than
   70 percent of these sites had hydrophytic vegetation directly above
   failures. In following the runout paths of failures, significantly more
   erosion per unit area occurred within clearcuts than in old-growth
   forests on slopes with gradients from 9 to 28 degrees (16 to 54
   percent). Runout length, controlled by hillslope position within
   deglaciated valleys, was typically longer in old-growth forests than in
   second growth and clearcuts (median values were 334, 201, and 153 m,
   respectively). Most landslides and debris flows deposited in first- and
   second-order channels before reaching the main stem channels used by
   anadromous fish. Slide deposits in old-growth forests were composed of a
   higher proportion of woody debris than deposits derived from slides in
   second growth or clearcuts.}},

Abstract = {{The two-dimensional soil erosion model CASC2D-SED simulates the dynamics
   of upland erosion during single rainstorms. The model is based on the
   raster-based surface runoff calculations from CASC2D. Rainfall
   precipitation is distributed in time and space. Infiltration is
   calculated from the Green-Ampt equations. Surface runoff is calculated
   from the diffusive wave approximation to the Saint-Venant equations in
   two-dimensions. Watershed data bases in raster Geographical Information
   System (GIS) provide information on the soil type, size fractions, soil
   erodibility, cropping management, and conservation practice factors for
   soil erosion calculations. Upland sediment transport is calculated for
   the size fractions (sand, silt, and clay), and the model displays the
   sediment flux, the amount of suspended sediment, and the net erosion and
   deposition using color graphics. The model has been tested on Goodwin
   Creek, Mississippi. The peak discharge and time to peak are within +/-
   20 percent and sediment transport rates within -50 percent to 200
   percent.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The applicability of empirical relationships governing phosphorus (P)
   retention and nutrient assimilation in lakes and reservoirs was extended
   to include free surface water wetland treatment systems. Mixed reactor
   models have been used in lakes to predict steady state P concentration,
   characterize trophic state, compare P-dynamics, and predict permissible
   P-loading rates. Applying lake models to free surface water wetlands
   treatment systems, it was found that: sedimentation rates, loading
   rates, and settling velocity in these wetlands, and their typology are
   comparable to their lake counterparts. The analyses also suggest that
   phosphorus removal efficiency in a free surface water wetland treatment
   system is independent of trophic status, and similar to lakes, these
   wetlands can be classified according to their trophic state. Oligo- and
   eutrophic wetland treatment systems can be defined by low and high TP
   inflow concentrations, respectively. Tn this study, oligotrophic status
   is defined as systems receiving inflow P-loading less than 0.10 g m(2)
   year(-1), and their P inputs are mainly derived from agricultural and
   stormwater runoff Eutrophic treatment systems, on the other hand, are
   defined as those receiving inflow P-loading higher than 0.20 g m(-2)
   year(-1), and their inputs are mainly derived from industrial and
   municipal wastewater. The comparability found between lakes and free
   surface water wetlands treatment systems raises the question: should we
   consider these wetlands ``shallow lakes?{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Pond-cypress, a deciduous conifer, is a dominant canopy species in
   depressional wetlands of the southeastern Coastal Plain (SCP). Extensive
   premature decline and death of pond-cypress trees in central Florida
   have been attributed to hydroperiod alterations due to excessive
   withdrawals of ground water from the Floridan aquifer. One factor
   identified in the decline process is basal decay, which may be related
   to the presence of Botryosphaeria rhodina and Fusarium species
   (nonaggressive, facultative fungal pathogens). These fungi have been
   cultured from sapwood tissue of declining pond-cypress associated with
   ground water mining, but not from pond-cypress away from ground water
   mining areas. In this experiment, differences in soluble (nonstructural)
   carbohydrate composition of branch tips were evaluated for one- and
   two-year old, nursery-grown (unsheltered) pond-cypress, following a year
   of growth under treatment conditions (control, fungal inoculation, water
   stress, and fungal inoculation plus water stress) in a growth chamber.
   Results from two methods of wet chemical analysis were compared
   (trimethylsilyl methylglycoside Method A, and alditol acetate - Method
   B). Three pentoses (arabinose, rhamnose, and xylose) and three hexoses
   (galactose, glucose, and mannose) were identified in branch tips from
   both age classes. A fourth hexose (fucose) also was identified in
   samples from the younger trees. The acidic sugar, galacturonic acid, was
   identified in both age classes using Method A. Results suggest that
   prolonged water stress is correlated with greater relative
   concentrations of the neutral soluble sugars rhamnose (P = 0.02), xylose
   (P = 0.02), and galactose (P = 0.02), in addition to the acidic sugar
   galacturonic acid (P = 0.01), for Method A, and arabinose (P = 0.02) for
   Method B. These results also suggest that in the absence of water
   stress, the fungal pathogen B. rhodina does not penetrate to the sapwood
   of the trees, and that inoculation with this fungal pathogen is not
   correlated with differences in relative concentrations of nonstructural,
   soluble carbohydrates, based on Method A analysis. Empirical evidence
   suggests that pond-cypress trees in depressional wetlands respond
   similarly to anthropogenic perturbations of ground water, but not to
   natural periods of drought in the absence of such perturbations.
   Therefore, pond-cypress appear to be integrators of groundwater
   perturbations. Greater concentrations of the soluble sugars identified
   in this study in pond-cypress branch tips may be hydroecological
   indicators of such anthropogenic perturbations as unsustainable yield
   from the regional aquifer and adverse impacts from aquifer storage and
   recovery (ASR) activities in the SCP.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to analyze the presence of 11 pesticide residues
   in 12 surface waters in the Piedmont and coastal plain regions of North
   Carolina. Samples were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays

   (GC/MS). ELISA detection limits were approximately an order of magnitude
   higher than GC/MS methods. Of the 5,035 analytical results from 742
   surface water samples, atrazine was detected in approximately 45 percent
   of the samples, five of which were at or above the Maximum Contaminant
   Level (MCL) of 3-ppb. Metolachlor was detected in 64 percent of the
   samples. Aldicarb, 2,4-D, chlorpyrifos, and chlorothalonil were also

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to analyze the presence of 11 selected pesticides
   in 12 surface water supply intakes in the Piedmont and coastal plain
   regions of North Carolina. Samples were assayed using enzyme linked
   immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Samples with pesticide detection of 1 mu
   g/L or greater were extracted and confirmed using gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Detection limits of the
   immunosorbent assays for pesticide residues were generally an order of
   magnitude higher than GC/MS. Atrazine was detected in approximately 45
   percent of the samples, and on two occasions was at or above the
   lifetime Maximum Contaminant Level of 3.0 mu g/L set by the
   Environmental Protection Agency for an annual average in finished
   drinking water. Metolachlor was detected in 58 percent of the samples.
   Of the remaining nine pesticides, including carbaryl, aldicarb, 2,4-D,
   chlorpyrifos, acetochlor, methomyl, carbofuran, alachlor, and
   chlorothalonil, only aldicarb, 2,4-D, and chlorpyrifos were detected in
   less than 9 percent of the samples for each pesticide.}},

Abstract = {{The South Florida Water Management District (District) constructed three
   experimental test cells (20 x 50 feet = 6.1 x 15.2 m) to determine the
   seepage influence of a major agricultural canal adjacent to the cells.
   These three cells represented the first stage of a series of
   experimental cells to determine the efficiency of algal-bacterial
   communities (periphyton) to successfully remove phosphorus (P) from the
   water. This treatment technology is known as Periphyton-based Stormwater
   Treatment Area (PSTA) and is being considered under the Supplemental
   Technology Program (Phase II) to comply with the Everglades Forever Act
   (EFA) of 1994. However, the efficiency of a PSTA in removing nutrients
   has not been documented yet. To determine the efficiency of PSTA
   technology to remove phosphorus (P) from the water, it is necessary to
   quantify all the components of the water budget. The purpose of the
   cells was to evaluate the potential seepage due to the operational range
   of stages into and out of the test cells. A steady-state,
   two-dimensional seepage (FastSEEP/SEEP2D) model was applied and
   successfully calibrated for that purpose. The model was calibrated using
   mean seepage flows obtained after drawdowns in each test cell, by
   pumping water out. These seepage flows as well as the boundary
   conditions (stages) were estimated by discretizing the recovery data.
   The recovery data represents the seepage from the agricultural canal
   into each of the test cells after the drawdowns, since the stages in the
   canal during the experiment did not change significantly and were high.
   Each of the three test cells was excavated to different bottom
   elevations to determine the effect of substrate differences on seepage
   rates. Values of hydraulic conductivity for five different layers in the
   models were based on field observations, lithologic descriptions, and
   slug tests. Modeled seepage produced reasonable results for the three
   test cells compared with estimated seepage from the recovery data,
   achieving a satisfactory calibration. The errors of the simulated
   seepage ranged from -6.1 to 16.8 percent (under and over estimation,
   respectively).}},

Abstract = {{Macroinvertebrate community data collected from streams in Wyoming were
   assessed at various scales: within one stream reach, between stream
   reaches within one stream, between streams, and between stream classes.
   Fourteen indices including number of individuals/m(2), biomass/m(2),
   number of taxa, Shannon's diversity index, and functional feeding group
   ratios were used to compare macroinvertebrates by stream reach and
   stream class. Statistical analysis indicated that for five of the 14
   indices, significant variability occurred between macroinvertebrate
   communities within one reach. For two of the remaining nine indices
   there was significant variability between communities from several
   reaches within the same stream. For seven of the nine indices, there was
   significant variability among macroinvertebrate communities from streams
   of the same class. Variability among the macroinvertebrate communities
   from the three stream classes was significantly different for seven of
   the nine indices. ANOVA results suggest that macroinvertebrate
   communities from different samples within one reach and between reaches
   within one stream were more comparable than those from different streams
   and different stream classes.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of the 1993 flood on river water and sediment quality were
   investigated using historical data and data collected from the Illinois
   River and Upper Mississippi River in a post-flood period. Overall the
   post-flood results showed systematic reductions and individual changes
   in the water and sediment constituents.
   The reductions in sediment metals and nutrients were most obvious at the
   Keokuk and Lock and Dam 26 stations. By analyzing and comparing the
   physical changes to the changes in water and sediment constituents at
   each station, it was found that physical processes such as sediment
   entrainment and, more importantly, the removal of fine sediment to be
   the main causes for the reduced concentrations in sediment constituents.
   On the other hand, sediment redistribution and associated secondary
   contamination could have caused the emergence of several water and
   sediment constituents that were undetected before the flood.}},

Abstract = {{Establishment of seagrass-based pollutant load reduction targets is a
   major aim of water quality management in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL)
   estuary. It is believed that light and water clarity are the Limiting
   factors affecting seagrass abundance and distribution in the Lagoon.
   Thus, targeted reductions of nutrients, dissolved organic matter and/or
   suspended sediments should achieve desired seagrass coverage goals. On
   an annual average, the Lagoon is receiving external loadings of 5,346,
   771, and 54,408 metric tons per year of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
   and total suspended solids (TSS), respectively. Most of the loadings are
   stormwater generated; thus, implementation of reduction targets will key
   in on major urban and agricultural stormwater systems. The process of
   developing targets requires the establishment of light requirements for
   seagrass. Two methods are being employed to develop such targets. One
   method is the application of a predictive, 3-D model that accounts for
   the essential interactive processes of the Lagoon: hydrology,
   hydrodynamics, water quality, nutrient uptake/release, seagrass growth
   rates, and light attenuation. The other method is based simply on the
   comparison of loading rates between: a developed sub-basin with
   associated seagrass impacts and an undeveloped sub-basin with adjacent
   healthy seagrass coverages. The latter method will provide the initial
   and preliminary targets that can be tested, confirmed, or modified by
   application of the 3-D model.}},

Abstract = {{The loess area of the midwestern United States contains thousands of
   miles of unstable stream channels that are undergoing system-wide
   channel-adjustment processes as a result of (1) modifications to
   drainage basins dating back to the turn of the 20th century, including
   land clearing and poor soil-conservation practices, which caused the
   filling of stream channels, and consequently (2) direct, human
   modifications to stream channels such as dredging and straightening to
   improve drainage conditions and reduce the frequency of out-of-bank
   flows. Today, many of these channels are still highly unstable and
   threaten bridges, other structures, and land adjacent to the channels.
   The most severe, widespread instabilities are in western Iowa where a
   thick cap of loess and the lack of sand- and gravel-sized bed sediments
   in many channels hinders downstream aggradation, bed-level recovery and
   the consequent reduction of bank heights, and renewed bank stability. In
   contrast, streams draining west-central Illinois, east-central Iowa, and
   other areas, where the loess cap is relatively thin and there are ample
   supplies of sand- and gravel-sized material, are closer to recovery.
   Throughout the region, however, channel widening by mass-wasting
   processes is the dominant adjustment process.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water and surface water interaction in the prairie pothole region
   of the United States and Canada is seasonally dominated by the presence
   of thick, frozen soil layers that affect infiltration. During a spring
   thaw, the subsoil may remain frozen, preventing infiltration. The impact
   of the frozen soil layer on the timing of infiltration of
   depressional-focused recharge to the ground water is not clearly
   understood. The objective of this paper is to relate changes in the
   water table during spring to changes in frost depth and soil water
   content. A depression and adjacent upland study site were instrumented
   with CRREL-type frost tubes, neutron probe access tubes, and ground
   water monitoring wells. Increases in water table levels in a depression
   occurred before the frost layer decomposed and infiltrating water
   quickly formed a recharge mound. Water table responses at the upland
   site took place as two events. The first event was a gradual rise,
   probably caused by the lateral dissemination of the recharge mound. The
   second rise was a rapid rise coinciding with the decomposition of the
   soil frost layer. Because of the accumulation of surface water in
   depressions, agricultural practices that remove water from a field can
   affect water resources management by limiting the addition of water
   recharge to unconfined ground water.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of nutrients from chemical fertilizer animal manure,
   wastewater, and atmospheric deposition to the eastern Iowa environment
   creates a large potential for nutrient transport in watersheds.
   Agriculture constitutes 93 percent of all land use in eastern Iowa. As
   part of the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Quality Assessment
   Program, water samples were collected (typically monthly) from six small
   and six large watersheds in eastern Iowa between March 1996 and
   September 1997. A Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to
   determine land use and quantify inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus within
   the study area. Streamflow from the watersheds is to the Mississippi
   River. Chemical fertilizer and animal manure account for 92 percent of
   the estimated total nitrogen and 99.9 percent of the estimated total
   phosphorus input in the study area. Total nitrogen and total phosphorus
   loads for 1996 were estimated for nine of the 12 rivers and creeks using
   a minimum variance unbiased estimator model. A seasonal pattern of
   concentrations and loads was observed. The greatest concentrations and
   loads occur in the late spring to early summer in conjunction with
   row-crop-fertilizer applications and spring runoff and again in the late
   fall to early winter as vegetation goes into dormancy and additional
   fertilizer is applied to row-crop fields. The three largest rivers in
   eastern Iowa transported an estimated total of 79,000 metric tons of
   total nitrogen and 6,800 metric tons of total phosphorus to the
   Mississippi River in 1996. The estimated mass of total nitrogen and
   total phosphorus transported to the Mississippi River represents about
   19 percent of all estimated nitrogen and 9 percent of all estimated
   phosphorus input to the study area.}},

   controlled drainage (GD) to reduce outflows during spring fish
   recruitment, and (3) controlled drainage to reduce outflows and conserve
   water during the growing season. Data from two pre-treatment years and
   three years of CD treatment with raised weirs at the watershed outlet
   are presented. CD treatment resulted in rises in water table elevations
   during the summer. But the rises were small and short-lived due to
   increased evapotranspiration (ET) rates as compared to the spring
   treatment with lower ET demands. CD treatment had no effect on water
   tables deeper than 1.3 m. CD treatments, however, significantly (alpha =
   0.05) reduced the storm outflows for all events, and peak out flow rates
   for most of the events depending upon the outlet weir level. In some
   events, flows did not occur at all in watersheds with CD. When event
   outflows occurred, duration of the event was sharply reduced because of
   reduced effective ditch depth. Water table depth at the start of an
   event influenced the effect of CD treatment on storm event hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{Several chlorinated solvent plumes threaten the sole-source aquifer
   underlying the Massachusetts Military Reservation at the western end of
   Cape Cod. Sensitive surface water features including ponds, cranberry
   bogs, and coastal wetlands are hydraulically connected to the aquifer.
   For one of the plumes (CS-10), the original remedy of 120 extraction and
   reinjection wells has the potential for significant disruption of
   surface water hydrology, through the localized drawdown and mounding of
   the water table. Recirculating wells with in-well air stripping offer a
   cost-effective alternative to conventional pump-and-treat technology
   that does not adversely affect the configuration of the water table.
   Pilot testing of a two well system, pumping 300 gpm, showed a capture
   radius of > 200 feet per well, in-well trichloroethylene (TCE) removal
   efficiencies of 92 to 98 percent per recirculation cycle, an average of
   three recirculation cycles within the capture zone, and no measurable
   effect on water table elevations at any point within the
   recirculation/treatment zone. During 120 days of operation, the mean
   concentration of TCE in the treatment zone was reduced by 83 percent,
   from 1,111 mu g/l to 184 mu g/l. Full-scale design projections indicate
   that 60 wells at an average spacing of 160 feet, having an aggregate
   recirculation11 MGD, can contain the CS-10 plume without ground water
   extraction or adverse hydraulic effects on surface water resources. The
   estimated capital costs for such a system are about \$7 million, and
   annual operations-and-maintenance costs should be about \$1.4 million,
   40 percent of those associated with a pump and treat system over a
   20-year period.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{203-213}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Twenty storm events were used to select design values of the HEC1 loss
   parameters STRTL and CNSTL in order to route the probable maximum flood,
   PMF, through the Englewood watershed, Ohio. The parameter STRTL
   represents the initial volume of water lost due to interception and
   incomplete saturation of the soil prior to the storm. The parameter
   CNSTL represents a continuous loss rate and depends only on the
   watershed. When optimized from each storm event, STRTL varied between
   0.0 and 3.4 inches with an average of 1.0 inch; CNSTL varied between
   0.02 and 0.26 inch/hour, and it followed a normal probability
   distribution with a mean of about 0.1 inch/hour. The absence of
   correlation between optimum CNSTL values and each of total rainfall,
   total loss, and runoff duration supported the selection of the mean
   CNSTL as a design value. PMF routing through the Englewood watershed
   revealed that the PMF at the outlet is not sensitive to STRTL, but
   highly affected by CNSTL variations. The insensitivity to STRTL was due
   to the presence of a dam at the outlet of the watershed that caused the
   buildup of water in the watershed, thereby masking the storage effect of
   STRTL. The peak PMF increased by about 27 percent when the design CNSTL
   was decreased to 0.05 inch/hour, and decreased by about 18 percent when
   the design CNSTL was increased to 0.15 inch/hour.}},

Abstract = {{Recurrent calls for integrated resource management urge that an
   understanding of human activities and populations be incorporated into
   natural resource research, management, and protection efforts. In this
   paper, we hypothesize that watersheds can be a valuable geography for
   organizing an inquiry into the relationship between humans and the
   environment, and we present a framework for conducting such efforts. The
   framework is grounded in the emerging field of landscape ecology and
   incorporates demographic theory and data. Demography has been advanced
   by technological capabilities associated with the 1990 Census. Employing
   Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, we couple Landsat Thematic
   Mapper (TM) land cover data with census-derived housing density data to
   demonstrate the operation of our framework and its utility for better
   understanding human-landscape interactions. In our investigation of the
   Kickapoo Watershed and two sub-watersheds, located in southwestern
   Wisconsin, we identify relationships between landscape composition and
   the distribution and social structure of human populations. Our findings
   offer insight into the interplay between people and biophysical systems.}},

Title = {{Adapting the law of water management to global climate change and other
   hydropolitical stresses}},

Abstract = {{Existing legal regimes for the management of water resources are already
   stressed by changing technologies and growing populations. There is
   little reason for doubt that today the planet is undergoing significant
   and even alarming climate change. In the past such global climatic
   changes had dramatic effects on water resource availability with
   disastrous consequences for many human communities. Today's climate
   changes can be managed without such disastrous consequences for present
   day communities only if there are major reforms to existing water law
   regimes at the local, national, and international levels. In particular,
   at the local and national levels, water resources must be treated as
   public property rather than as common or private property. At the
   international level, water must be managed at the drainage basin level
   rather than according to national boundaries that largely ignore
   rational water management criteria. At all levels, care must be given to
   decentralizing decision making and to use economic incentives insofar as
   possible, without, however, mistaking economic incentives for markets.
   The public nature of water resources precludes true markets as a
   significant management tool.}},

Abstract = {{Two general circulation models (GCMs) used in the U.S. national
   assessment of the potential consequences of climate variability and
   change (CGCM1 and HadCM2) show a large increase in precipitation in the
   future over the southwestern U.S., particularly during winter. This
   precipitation increase is an extension of a larger region of increased
   precipitation in the Pacific Ocean off the west coast of North America
   that is associated with a deepened and southward-shifted Aleutian Low, a
   weaker subtropical high, and warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs). The
   models differ in their simulation of precipitation anomalies over the
   southeastern U.S., with CGCM1 showing drier conditions and HadCM2
   skewing wetter conditions in the future. While both models show
   decreased frequency of Atlantic storms, consistent with decreased
   meridional and land/sea temperature gradients, the more coastal position
   of the storm track in CGCM1 results in less precipitation than modern
   along the eastern seaboard of the U.S. During summer, differences in
   land surface models within the two GCMs sometimes lead to differences in
   soil moisture that feed back to the precipitation over land due to
   available moisture.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of potential climate change on mean annual runoff in the

   Prediction and Research (HAD). In general, the CCC GCM climate results
   in decreases in runoff for the conterminous U.S., and the HAD GCM
   climate produces increases in runoff. These estimated changes in runoff
   primarily are the result of estimated changes in precipitation. The
   changes in mean annual runoff however, mostly are smaller than the
   decade-to-decade variability in GCM-based mean annual runoff and errors
   in GCM-based runoff. The differences in simulated runoff between the two
   GCMs, together with decade-to-decade variability and errors in GCM-based
   runoff, cause the estimates of changes in runoff to be uncertain and

Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of climate change on water resources requires
   coupling atmospheric and hydrologic models. With the wide array of
   hydrologic models, from simple empirical to complex physically based, it
   is not clear which is preferable to simulate hydrologic variations over
   long time scales. To address this issue, a black-box artificial neural
   network (ANN) model was compared to a distributed parameter conceptual
   Geographic Information System based Hydrologic Modeling System
   (GIS-HMS). Both models computed daily direct surface runoff in four
   sub-basins of the West Branch of the Susquehanna River Basin,
   Pennsylvania and were evaluated with five objective functions. Overall,
   results were comparable between models. However, the ANN was favored in
   the larger sub-basins, while GIS-HMS was more accurate in the smaller
   catchments. Both models were impaired by the poor spatial and temporal
   resolution of precipitation data and the simplified representation of
   antecedent soil-moisture conditions. In the context of climate change,
   where simulations are limited by computing power, results suggest that
   both models are appropriate. When detailed simulations are essential,
   GIS-HMS is a preferable model to use. On the other hand, the ANN model
   is more suitable when multiple scenarios require immediate analysis and
   the distributed qualities of runoff are not required.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the possible impacts of global climate change on
   low streamflows in the Midwest, both directly, through lower
   precipitation, and indirectly, by rendering irrigation profitable in
   areas where it has found little application in the past. In the analysis
   presented here, streamflow data are altered to represent the effect of
   climate change and stream-supplied irrigation, and then used to estimate
   new values for two low-flow criteria, the one- and seven-day-ten-year
   low flows ((7)Q(10) and (1)Q(10)) Under 20 climate change and irrigation
   scenarios. Additionally, the frequencies of violation of these two
   criteria, and multiple violations in a three-year period, are
   determined.
   Results show that the potential impact of the assumed climate change
   scenarios on low flow standards is substantial. A 25 percent decrease in
   mean precipitation results in a 63 percent reduction in design now, even
   in the absence of irrigation. With irrigation, the reduction can be as
   much as 100 percent. The frequency of single violations of low flow
   criteria is found to increase several fold with irrigation. The
   frequency of multiple violations of low flow criteria in a three-year
   period is sensitive to climate change, increasing from around 20 percent
   to nearly 100 percent as the climate change becomes more severe.}},

Abstract = {{We review published analyses of the effects of climate change on goods
   and services provided by freshwater ecosystems in the United States.
   Climate-induced changes must be assessed in the context of massive
   anthropogenic changes in water quantity and quality resulting from
   altered patterns of land use, water withdrawal, and species invasions;
   these may dwarf or exacerbate climate-induced changes. Water to meet
   instream needs is competing with other uses of water, and that
   competition is likely to be increased by climate change. We review
   recent predictions of the impacts of climate change on aquatic
   ecosystems in eight regions of North America. Impacts include warmer
   temperatures that alter lake mixing regimes and availability of fish
   habitat; changed magnitude and seasonality of runoff regimes that alter
   nutrient loading and limit habitat availability at low flow; and loss of
   prairie pothole wetlands that reduces waterfowl populations. Many of the
   predicted changes in aquatic ecosystems are a consequence of climatic
   effects on terrestrial ecosystems; shifts in riparian vegetation and
   hydrology are particularly critical. We review models that could be used
   to explore potential effects of climate change on freshwater ecosystems;
   these include models of instream flow, bioenergetics models, nutrient
   spiraling models, and models relating riverine food webs to hydrologic
   regime. We discuss potential ecological risks, benefits, and costs of
   climate change and identify information needs and model improvements
   that are required to improve our ability to predict and identify climate
   change impacts and to evaluate management options.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in global climate may alter hydrologic conditions and have a
   variety of effects on human settlements and ecological systems. The
   effects include changes in water supply and quality for domestic,
   irrigation, recreational, commercial, and industrial uses; in instream
   flows that support aquatic ecosystems, recreation uses, hydropower,
   navigation, and wastewater assimilation; in wetland extent and
   productivity that support fish, wildlife, and wastewater assimilation;
   and in the frequency and severity of floods. Watersheds where water
   resources are stressed under current climate are most likely to be
   vulnerable to changes in mean climate-and extreme events. This study
   identified key aspects of water supply and use that could be adversely
   affected by climate change, developed measures and criteria useful for
   assessing the vulnerability of regional water resources and water
   dependent resources to climate change, developed a regional database of
   water sensitive variables consistent with the vulnerability measures,
   and applied the criteria in a regional study of the vulnerability of
   U.S. water resources. Key findings highlight the vulnerability of
   consumptive uses in the western and, in particular, the southwestern
   United States. However, southern United States watersheds are relatively
   more vulnerable to changes in water quality, flooding, and other
   instream uses.}},

Abstract = {{This research examines the sensitivity and vulnerability of community
   water systems (CWSs) to weather and climate in the Pennsylvania portion
   of the Susquehanna River Basin. Three key findings emerge from a survey
   of 506 CWS managers. First, CWSs are sensitive to extreme weather and
   climate, but that sensitivity is determined more by type of system than
   system size. CWSs that rely partly or wholly on surface water face more
   disruptions than do groundwater systems. Larger systems have more
   problems with flooding, and size is not a significant determinant of
   outages from storms or disruptions from droughts. Second, CWS managers
   are unsure about global warming. Few managers dismiss global warming;
   most think global warming could be a problem but are unwilling to
   consider it in their planning activities until greater scientific
   certainty exists. Third, the nature of the CWS, its sensitivity to
   weather and climate, and projected risks from weather and climate are
   insignificant determinants of how managers plan. Experienced, full-time
   managers are more likely to consider future weather and climate
   scenarios in their planning, while inexperienced and part-time managers
   are less likely to do so. Implications of these findings include support
   for efforts to move away from surface water, for clear communication of
   climate change information, and for the hiring and retention of
   full-time professional CWS managers.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of historical relationships between seasonal weather
   conditions and water resource conditions in Illinois provides insights
   to the challenges of projecting such relationships under conditions of
   climate change. In Illinois for 1901-1997 there were major temporal
   shifts in types of seasonal conditions that have positive and negative
   effects on surface water and ground water supplies and their quality.
   Major seasonal effects came in the spring and summer seasons and when
   either wet-and-warm or dry-and-warm weather conditions prevailed in
   either season. Sixty percent of the summer seasons creating negative
   impacts occurred during only 40 years: 1911-1940 and 1951-1960. Seasons
   creating impacts relate well to the frequency of cyclone passages and to
   the incidence of El Nino or La Nina conditions. This reveals that future
   climate fluctuations that shift the frequency of cyclones and/or ENSO
   events will have profound effects on Midwestern seasonal conditions that
   affect water resources. Projecting future effects of climate change on
   water resources will need to consider how shifts in water use and water
   management technologies act to re-define the seasonal weather conditions
   that are critical.}},

Abstract = {{A wide variety of regional assessments of the water-related impacts of
   climatic change have been done over the past two decades, using
   different methods, approaches, climate models, and assumptions. As part
   of the Water Sector research for the National Assessment of the
   Implications of Climatic Variability and Change for the United States,
   several major summaries have been prepared, looking at the differences
   and similarities in results among regional research projects. Two such
   summaries are presented here, for the Colorado River Basin and the
   Sacramento River Basin. Both of these watersheds are vitally important
   to the social, economic, and ecological character of their regions; both
   are large snowmelt-driven basins; both have extensive and complex water
   management systems in place; and both have had numerous, independent
   studies done on them. This review analyzes the models, methods, climate
   assumptions, and conclusions from these studies, and places them in the
   context of the new climate scenarios developed for the National
   Assessment. Some significant and consistent impacts have been identified
   for these basins, across a wide range of potential climate changes.
   Among the most important is the shift in the timing of runoff that
   results from changes in snowfall and snowmelt dynamics. This shift has
   been seen in every regional result across these two basins despite
   differences in models and climate change assumptions. The implications
   of these impacts for water management, planning, and policy are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the current assessment of climate impacts on water
   resources, including aquatic ecosystems, agricultural demands, and water
   management, in the U.S. Great Plains. Climate change in the region may
   have profound effects on agricultural users, aquatic ecosystems, and
   urban and industrial users alike. In the central Great Plains Region,
   the potential impacts of climate changes include changes in winter
   snowfall and snow-melt, growing season rainfall amounts and intensities,
   minimum winter temperature, and summer time average temperature.
   Specifically, results from general circulation models indicate that both
   annual average temperatures and total annual precipitation will increase
   over the region. However, the seasonal patterns are not uniform. The
   combined effect of these changes in weather patterns and average
   seasonal climate will affect numerous sectors critical to the economic,
   social and ecological welfare of this region. Research is needed to
   better address the current competition among the water needs of
   agriculture, urban and industrial uses, and natural ecosystems, and then
   to look at potential changes. These diverse demands on water needs in
   this region compound the difficulty in managing water use and projecting
   the impact of climate changes among the various critical sectors in this

Abstract = {{To fully take advantage of regional climate forecast information for
   agricultural applications, the relationship between divisional and
   station scale precipitation characteristics must be quantified. The
   spatial variability of monthly precipitation is assumed-to consist of
   two components: a systematic and a random component. The systematic
   component is defined by differences in long-term mean precipitation
   between stations within a climate division, and the-random component by
   differences between station and divisional standardized values. For the
   Central Climate Division of Oklahoma, the systematic component has a
   positive precipitation gradient from west to east with a slope ranging
   between 3 to 16 mm of precipitation per 100 km depending on the month of
   the year. On the other hand, the random component ranges between 27 to
   48 percent of the mean temporal variation of the monthly precipitation.
   This significant random spatial variability leads to large localized
   departures from divisional values, and clearly demonstrates the critical
   influence of the random component in the utilization of divisional
   climate forecasts for local agricultural applications. The results of
   this study also provide an uncertainty range for local monthly
   precipitation projections that are derived from divisional climate
   information.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change due to the buildup of greenhouse gases in the
   atmosphere has serious potential impacts on water resources in the
   Pacific Northwest. Climate scenarios produced by general circulation
   models (GCMs) do not provide enough spatial specificity for studying
   water resources in mountain watersheds. This study uses dynamical
   downscaling with a regional climate model (RCM) driven by a GCM to
   simulate climate change scenarios. The RCM uses a subgrid
   parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover to
   simulate surface climate at the spatial scale suitable for the
   representation of topographic effects over mountainous regions.
   Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day
   climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of
   atmospheric CO2 concentration. The RCM results indicate an average
   warming of about 2.5 degrees C, and precipitation generally increases
   over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. These
   simulations were used to drive a distributed hydrology model of two snow
   dominated watersheds, the American River and Middle Fork Flathead, in
   the Pacific Northwest to obtain more detailed estimates of the
   sensitivity of water resources to climate change. Results show that as
   more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow in the warmer climate,
   there is a 60 percent reduction in snowpack and a significant shift in
   the seasonal pattern of streamflow in the American River. Much less
   drastic changes are found in the Middle Fork Flathead where snowpack is
   only reduced by 18 percent and the seasonal pattern of streamflow
   remains intact. This study shows that the impacts of climate change on
   water resources are highly region specific. Furthermore, under the
   specific climate change scenario, the impacts are largely driven by the
   warming trend rather than the precipitation trend, which is small.}},

Abstract = {{April 1 snowpack accumulations measured at 311 snow courses in the
   western United States (U.S.) are grouped using a correlation-based
   cluster analysis. A conceptual snow accumulation and melt model and
   monthly temperature and precipitation for each cluster are used to
   estimate cluster-average April 1 snowpack. The conceptual snow model is
   subsequently used to estimate future snowpack by using changes in
   monthly temperature and precipitation simulated by the Canadian Centre
   for Climate Modeling and Analysis (CCC) and the Hadley Centre for
   Climate Prediction and Research (HADLEY) general circulation models
   (GCMs). Results for the CCC model indicate that although winter
   precipitation is estimated to increase in the future, increases in
   temperatures will result in large decreases in April 1 snowpack for the
   entire western US. Results for the HADLEY model also indicate large
   decreases in April 1 snowpack for most of the western US, but the
   decreases are not as severe as those estimated using the CCC
   simulations. Although snowpack conditions are estimated to decrease for
   most areas of the western US, both GCMs estimate a general increase in
   winter precipitation toward the latter half of the next century. Thus,
   water quantity may be increased in the western US; however, the timing
   of runoff will be altered because precipitation will more frequently
   occur as rain rather than as snow.}},

Abstract = {{In two workshops, we evaluated decision analysis methods for comparing
   Lake Erie levels management alternatives under climate change
   uncertainty. In particular, we wanted to see how acceptable and
   effective those methods could be in a public planning setting. The
   methods evaluated included simulation modeling, scenario analysis,
   decision trees and structured group discussions. We evaluated the
   methods by interviewing the workshop participants before and after the
   workshops. The participants, who were experienced Great Lakes water
   resources managers, concluded that simulation modeling is user-friendly
   enough to enable scenario analysis even in workshop settings for large
   public planning studies. They felt that simulation modeling can improve
   not only understanding of the system, but also of the options for
   managing it. Scenario analysis revealed that the decision for the ease
   study, Lake Erie water level regulation, could be altered by the
   likelihood of climate change. The participants also recommended that
   structured group discussions be used in public planning settings to
   elicit ideas and opinions. On the other hand, the participants were less
   optimistic about decision trees because they felt that the public might
   view subjective probabilities as difficult to understand and subject to
   manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted an assessment of Great Lakes
   water resources impacts under transient climate change scenarios. The
   integrated model linked empirical regional climate downscaling,
   hydrologic and hydraulic models, and water resource use sub-models. The
   water resource uses include hydropower, navigation, shoreline damages,
   and wetland area. The study is unique in that both steady-state 2xCO(2)
   and transient global circulation model (GCM) scenarios were used and
   compared to each other. The results are consistent with other impact
   studies in that high scatter in regional climate among the GCM scenarios
   lead to high uncertainty in impacts. Nevertheless, the transient
   scenarios show that in the near-term (approximately 20 years)
   significant changes could occur. This result only adds to the urgency of
   creating more flexible and robust management of water resources uses.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the distribution of flood flows in the Upper
   Mississippi, Lower Missouri, and Illinois Rivers and their relationship
   to climatic indices. Global climate patterns including El Nino/Southern
   Oscillation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and the North Atlantic
   Oscillation explained very little of the variations in flow peaks.
   However, large and statistically significant upward trends were found in
   many gauge records along the Upper Mississippi and Missouri Rivers: at
   Hermann on the Missouri River above the confluence with the Mississippi
   (p = 2 percent), at Hannibal on the Mississippi River (p < 0.1 percent),
   at Meredosia on the Illinois River (p = 0.7 percent), and at St. Louis
   on the Mississippi below the confluence of all three rivers (p = 1
   percent). This challenges the traditional assumption that flood series
   are independent and identically distributed random variables and
   suggests that flood risk changes over time.}},

   since 1994 for short-term precipitation and streamflow predictions and
   seasonal hindcast analysis with good skill. During the 1997-1998 winter,
   experimental seasonal forecasts were made in collaboration with the NOAA
   Climate Prediction Center and UCLA with promising results. Preliminary

Abstract = {{An assessment of current and future water quality conditions in the
   southeastern United States has been conducted using the EPA BASINS
   GIS/database system. The analysis has been conducted for dissolved
   oxygen, total nitrate nitrogen and pH. Future streamflow conditions have
   been predicted for the region based on the United Kingdom Hadley Center
   climate model. Thus far, the analyses have been conducted at a fairly
   coarse spatial scale due to time and resource limitations. Two
   hydrologic modeling techniques have been employed in future streamflow
   prediction: a regional stochastic approach and the application of a
   physically based soil moisture model. The regional model has been
   applied to the entire area while the physically based model is being
   used at selected locations to enhance and support the stochastic model.
   The results of the study reveal that few basins in the southeast exhibit
   dissolved oxygen problems, but that several watersheds exhibit high
   nitrogen levels. These basins are located in regions of intense
   agricultural activity or in proximity to the gulf coast. In many of
   these areas, streamflow is projected to decline over the next 30-50
   years,thus exacerbating these water quality problems.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change has the potential to have dramatic effects on the
   agricultural sector nationally and internationally as documented in many
   research papers. This paper reports on research that was focused on a
   specific crop growing area to demonstrate how farm managers might
   respond to climate-induced yield changes and the implications of these
   responses for agricultural water use. The Hadley model was used to
   generate climate scenarios for important agricultural areas of Georgia
   in 2030 and 2090. Linked crop response models indicated generally
   positive yield changes, as increased temperatures were associated with
   increased precipitation and CO2. Using a farm management model,
   differences in climate-induced yield impacts among crops led to changes
   in crop mix and associated water use; non-irrigated cropland received
   greater benefit since irrigated land was already receiving adequate
   moisture. Model results suggest that farm managers will increase
   cropping intensity by decreasing fallowing and increasing double
   cropping; corn acreage decreased dramatically, peanuts decreased
   moderately and cotton and winter wheat increased. Water use on currently
   irrigated cropland fell. The potential for increased water use through
   conversion of agriculturally important. but currently non-irrigated,
   growing areas is substantial.}},

Abstract = {{A greenhouse warning would have major effects on water supplies and
   demands. A framework for examining the socioeconomic impacts associated
   with changes in the long-term availability of water is developed and
   applied to the hydrologic implications of the Canadian and British
   Hadley2 general circulation models (GCMs) for the 18 water resource
   regions in the conterminous United States. The climate projections of
   these two GCMs have very different implications for future water
   supplies and costs. The Canadian model suggests most of the nation would
   be much drier in the year 2030. Under the least-cost management scenario
   the drier climate could add nearly \$105 billion to the estimated costs
   of balancing supplies and demands relative to the costs without climate
   change. Measures to protect instream flows and irrigation could result
   in significantly higher costs. In contrast, projections based on the
   Hadley model suggest water supplies would increase throughout much of
   the nation, reducing the costs of balancing water supplies with demands
   relative to the no-climate change case.}},

Abstract = {{Competition for water resources is becoming an increasingly important
   issue in the southeastern U.S. The potential impacts of future
   precipitation and runoff estimated by a transient global climate model
   (HADCM2) on competing water resources in the Southeast has been
   conducted. Issues of agricultural management, irrigation water
   withdrawals, and water quality were studied over three time periods:
   1974-1993, 2020-2039, and 2080-2099 in five water basins identified
   previously as exhibiting water-related problems. These basins, which
   encompass the boundary between Alabama and Mississippi, cover four
   important agricultural counties in Mississippi. Irrigation water
   requirements generated by crop growth models for corn, soybeans, and
   winter wheat were coupled with monthly runoff for the impacted basins
   estimated by the SWAT water balance model. The results of the study
   reveal that in the next 20-40 years water availability in the southern
   portions of the study area will decline as much as 10 percent during
   times when water requirements for agricultural production are crucial.
   Maintaining or expanding existing crop yields under future climate
   regimes may require additional irrigation water and increase competition

Abstract = {{As part of the National Assessment of Climate Change, the implications
   of future climate predictions derived from four global climate models
   (GCMs) were used to evaluate possible future changes to Pacific
   Northwest climate, the surface water response of the Columbia River
   basin, and the ability of the Columbia River reservoir system to meet
   regional water resources objectives. Two representative GCM simulations
   from the Hadley Centre (HC) and Max Planck Institute (MPI) were selected
   from a group of GCM simulations made available via the National
   Assessment for climate change. From these simulations, quasi-stationary,
   decadal mean temperature and precipitation changes were used to perturb
   historical records of precipitation and temperature data to create
   inferred conditions for 2025, 2045, and 2095. These perturbed records,
   which represent future climate in the experiments, were used to drive a
   macro-scale hydrology model of the Columbia River at 1/8 degree
   resolution. The altered streamflows simulated for each scenario were, in
   turn, used to drive a reservoir model, from which the ability of the
   system to meet water resources objectives was determined relative to a
   simulated hydrologic base case (current climate). Although the two GCM
   simulations showed somewhat different seasonal patterns for temperature
   change, in general the simulations show reasonably consistent basin
   average increases in temperature of about 1.8-2.1 degrees C for 2025,
   and about 2.3-2.9 degrees C for 2045. The HC simulations predict an
   annual average temperature increase of about 4.5 degrees C for 2095.
   Changes in basin averaged winter precipitation range from -1 percent to
   +20 percent for the HC and MPI scenarios, and summer precipitation is
   also variously affected. These changes in climate result in significant
   increases in winter runoff volumes due to increased winter precipitation
   and warmer winter temperatures, with resulting reductions in snowpack.
   Average March 1 basin average snow water equivalents are 75 to 85
   percent of the base case for 2025, and 55 to 65 percent of the base case
   by 2045. By 2045 the reduced snowpack and earlier snow melt, coupled
   with higher evapotranspiration in early summer, would lead to earlier
   spring peak flows and reduced runoff volumes from April-September
   ranging from about 75 percent to 90 percent of the base case. Annual
   runoff volumes range from 85 percent to 110 percent of the base case in
   the simulations for 2045. These changes in streamflow create increased
   competition for water during the spring, summer, and early fall between
   non-firm energy production, irrigation, instream flow, and recreation.
   Flood control effectiveness is moderately reduced for most of the
   scenarios examined, and desirable navigation conditions on the Snake are
   generally enhanced or unchanged. Current levels of winter-dominated firm
   energy production are only significantly impacted for the MPI 2045
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{We apply a physically based lake model to assess the response of North
   American lakes to future climate conditions as portrayed by the
   transient trace-gas simulations conducted with the Max Planck Institute
   (ECHAM4) and the Canadian Climate Center (CGCM1) atmosphere-ocean
   general circulation models (A/OGCMs). To quantify spatial patterns of
   lake responses (temperature, mixing, ice cover, evaporation) we ran the
   lake model for theoretical lakes of specified area, depth, and
   transparency over a uniformly spaced (50 lan) grid. The simulations were
   conducted for two 10-year periods that represent present climatic
   conditions and those around the time of CO2 doubling. Although the
   climate model output produces simulated lake responses that differ in
   specific regional details, there is broad agreement with regard to the
   direction and area of change. In particular, lake temperatures are
   generally warmer in the future as a result of warmer climatic conditions
   and a substantial loss (> 100 days/yr) of winter ice cover. Simulated
   summer lake temperatures are higher than 30 degrees C over the Midwest
   and south, suggesting the potential for future disturbance of existing
   aquatic ecosystems. Overall increases in lake evaporation combine with
   disparate changes in A/OGCM precipitation to produce future changes in
   net moisture (precipitation minus evaporation) that are of less fidelity
   than those of lake temperature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on new methods of linking climate change scenarios
   with hydrologic, agricultural an water planning models to study future
   water availability for agriculture, an essential element of
   sustainability. The study is based on the integration of models of water
   supply and demand, and of crop growth and irrigation management.
   Consistent modeling assumptions, available databases, and scenario
   simulations are used to capture a range of possible future conditions.
   The linked models include WATBAL for water supply; CERES, SOYGRO, and
   CROPWAT for crop and irrigation modeling; and WEAP for water demand
   forecasting, planning and evaluation. These models are applied to the
   U.S. Cornbelt using forecasts of climate change, agricultural
   production, population and GDP growth.
   Results suggest that, at least in the near term, the relative abundance
   of water for agriculture can be maintained under climate change
   conditions. However, increased water demands from urban growth,
   increases in reservoir evaporation and increases in crop consumptive use
   must be accommodated by timely improvements in crop, irrigation and
   drainage technology, water management, and institutions. These
   improvements are likely to require substantial resources and expertise.
   In the highly irrigated basins of the region, irrigation demand greatly
   exceeds industrial and municipal demands. When improvements in
   irrigation efficiency are tested, these basins respond by reducing
   demand and lessening environmental stress with an improvement in system
   reliability, effects particularly evident under a high technology
   scenario. Rainfed lands in the Cornbelt are not forced to invest in
   irrigation, but there is some concern about increased water-logging
   during the spring and consequent required increased investment in
   agricultural drainage. One major water region in the Cornbelt also
   provides a useful caveat: change will not necessarily be continuous and
   monotonic. Under one GCM scenario for the 2010s, the region shows a
   significant decrease in system reliability, while the scenario for the
   2020s shows an increase.}},

Abstract = {{Manures and fertilizers are applied to agricultural lands in excess of
   recommended amounts, resulting in widespread pollution of surface and
   ground water and contributing a substantial source of greenhouse gases
   associated with global warming. By developing policies that exploit the
   value of farm produced nutrients, input costs can be minimized. Better
   accounting for or crediting of farm produced nutrients is leading to
   economically beneficial conservation of fertilizer. In addition, hog
   producers who own enough land may benefit from properly managing manure
   nutrients. Poultry litter is valuable as fertilizer and can be marketed
   by independent dealers to farmers in nutrient deficit areas, with very
   modest assistance from the government. Dairy producers may modify their
   past income support programs to finance central compost facilities.
   Although nutrient problems were neglected in the past, recent Federal
   initiatives and joint initiatives with states exploit many of these and
   other opportunities to avoid excessive application of nutrients to the

Abstract = {{In this paper, we review the physical characteristics of agricultural
   nonpoint pollution and discuss the implications for setting appropriate
   pollution control objectives and designing incentive-based pollution
   control policies. First, we discuss that policy objectives must be
   designed carefully to ensure positive economic net benefits can be
   expected from pollution control. Next, we review several classes of
   incentives and recommend the use of design-based incentives (i.e.,
   incentives based on variable input use, management practices, and land
   use) for controlling nonpoint pollution. Cost-effectiveness requires
   that incentives elicit three types of responses from farmers: (1) use
   variable inputs at appropriate levels, (2) adopt appropriate management
   practices, and (3) make appropriate land use decisions at the extensive
   margin of production. If a set of incentives fails to induce the correct
   responses, the resulting runoff levels and hence ambient pollution
   levels and damages will be too large relative to policy goals. A review
   of existing programs suggests that greater program coordination and
   improved targeting of incentives are needed for further water quality
   improvements. Alternatively, properly designed market-based systems may
   be effective alternatives. These systems would reduce overall pollution
   control costs by allowing markets to allocate point source and nonpoint
   source control costs more efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of a continuous daily water balance
   model called SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) for the conterminous
   U.S. The local water balance is represented by four control volumes; (1)
   snow, (2) soil profile, (3) shallow aquifer, and (4) deep aquifer. The
   components of the water balance are simulated using ``storage{''} models
   and readily available input parameters. All the required databases
   (soils, landuse, and topography) were assembled for the conterminous
   U.S. at 1:250,000 scale. A GIS interface was utilized to automate the
   assembly of the model input files from map layers and relational
   databases. The hydrologic balance for each soil association polygon
   (78,863 nationwide) was simulated without calibration for 20 years using
   dominant soil and land use properties. The model was validated by
   comparing simulated average annual runoff with long term average annual
   runoff from USGS stream gage records. Results indicate over 45 percent
   of the modeled U.S. are within 50 mm of measured, and 18 percent are
   within 10 mm without calibration. The model tended to underpredict
   runoff in mountain areas due to lack of climate stations at high
   elevations. Given the limitations of the study, (i.e., spatial
   resolution of the data bases and model simplicity), the results show
   that the large scale hydrologic balance can be realistically simulated
   using a continuous water balance model.}},

   translated to population responses and economic benefits. Analysis
   concluded that instream flows cannot compete on the northern Colorado

   feasible way to enhance instream flows; and establishing an instream
   flow program on the Cache La Poudre River mainstem is a potentially
   profitable opportunity. The alliance of models is a dynamic

Abstract = {{Watershed planning groups and action agencies seek to understand how
   lake water quality responds to changes in watershed management. This
   study developed and demonstrated the applicability of an integrated
   modeling approach for providing this information. An integrated model
   linking watershed conditions to water-quality of the receiving lake
   incorporated the following components: (1) an event-based AGNPS model to
   estimate watershed pollutant losses; (2) annualization of AGNPS results
   to produce annual lake pollutant loadings; (3) a baseflow separation
   package, SAM, to estimate baseflow; (4) estimates of nutrients in
   baseflow and point sources; and (5) linkage of watershed loadings
   directly to EUTROMOD lake water quality algorithms. Results are
   presented for Melvern Lake, a 28-km(2) multipurpose reservoir with a
   900-km(2) agricultural watershed in east central Kansas. Reasonable
   estimates of current lake quality were attained using an average
   phosphorus availability factor of 31 percent to calibrate model results
   to measured in-lake phosphorus. Comparison of a range of possible
   scenarios, including all cropland changed to no-till (best case) and all
   CRP and good-condition grasslands changed to cropland (worst case),
   indicated only a (4 percent change for in-lake phosphorus and a (2
   percent change for chlorophyll a. These results indicated that this
   watershed is not sensitive to projected changes in land use and
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Floodplain forests directly influence water quality by serving as sinks,
   sources, or transformers of nutrients. Increases in the demand for
   timber raise the question of how silvicultural disturbance may affect
   this function. The objective of this research was to compare
   biogeochemical relationships between undisturbed vs. disturbed
   conditions in a floodplain forest. A randomized complete block design
   consisting of three blocks and two treatments (partial harvest and
   undisturbed) was installed on the Flint River floodplain, Georgia. The
   partial cut was conducted during September-October 1993. Automated water
   samplers were situated to sample during flood events as sheetflow
   entered and exited treatment plots during the 1994, 1995 and 1996 flood
   seasons. Pre- vs, post-contact comparisons indicated that the
   undisturbed floodplain has minimal influence on water chemistry at this
   scale of measurement. Although the partial harvest on an 8-ha scale had
   minimal effect upon sheetflow water chemistry for three years following
   harvest, the data suggest that harvests may stimulate a minor increase
   in Ca and K sink activity.}},

Abstract = {{Data from seven Management Systems Evaluation Areas (MSEA) were used to
   test the sensitivity of a leaching model, Pesticide Root Zone Model-a,
   to a variety of hydrologic settings in the Midwest. Atrazine leaching
   was simulated because it was prevalent in the MSEA studies and is
   frequently detected in the region's groundwater. Short-term simulations
   used site-specific soil and chemical parameters. Generalized simulations
   used data available from regional soil databases and standardized
   variables. Accurate short-term simulations were precluded by lack of
   antecedent atrazine concentrations in the soil profile and water,
   suggesting that simulations using data for less than five years
   underestimate atrazine leaching. The seven sites were ranked in order of
   atrazine detection frequency (concentration > 0.2 mu g L(-1)) in soil
   water at 2 m depth in simulations. The rank order of the sites based on
   longterm simulations were similar to the ranks of sites based on
   atrazine detection frequency from groundwater monitoring. Simulations
   with Map Unit Use File (MUUF) soils data were more highly correlated
   with ranks of observed atrazine detection frequencies than were
   short-term simulations using site-specific soil data. Simulations using
   the MUUF data for soil parameters were sufficiently similarity to
   observed atrazine detection to allow the credible use of regional soils
   data for simulating leaching with PRZM-2 in a variety of Midwest soil
   and hydrologic conditions. This is encouraging for regional modeling
   efforts because soil parameters are among the most critical for
   operating PRZM-2 and many other leaching models.}},

Abstract = {{A user-friendly decision support system (DSS) for long-term reservoir
   operation has been introduced with an eye to practical use. The system
   can assist reservoir managers to work out applicable rules for real-time
   reservoir operation. The DSS model has already been applied
   experimentally to the main reservoirs in Taiwan with success. In this
   study, Tsengwen Reservoir, the largest reservoir in Taiwan, was chosen
   to test the applicability of the model. The simulation results show that
   the DSS is not only well suited to long-term reservoir operation, but
   also very easily applied. A handy DSS was designed for user-friendly
   computer interaction with Microsoft Excel in the Windows system. Users
   can survey on-line reservoir operation with a browser on the World Wide
   Web (WWW). The uniform resource locator of the DSS is
   http://wrm.hre.ntou.edu.tw/. So users may easily access the DSS via the
   Internet.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally in the application of hydrologic/water quality (H/WQ)
   models, rainfall is assumed to be spatially homogeneous and is
   considered not to contribute to output uncertainty. The objective of
   this study was to assess the uncertainty induced in model outputs solely
   due to rainfall spatial variability. The study was conducted using the
   AGNPS model and the rainfall pattern captured by a network of 17 rain
   gauges. For each rainfall event, the model was run using the rainfall
   captured by each rain gauge, one at a time, under the assumption of
   rainfall spatial homogeneity. A large uncertainty in the modeled outputs
   resulted from the rainfall spatial variability. The uncertainty in the
   modeled outputs exceeded the input rainfall uncertainty. Results of this
   study indicate that spatial variability of rainfall should be captured
   and used in H/WQ models in order to accurately assess the release and
   transport of pollutants. A large uncertainty in the model outputs can be
   expected if this rainfall property is not taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Sensible (H) and latent (LE) heat fluxes, soil moisture (SM) and surface
   temperatures (T-s) were analyzed from seven sites at FIFE to evaluate
   relationships among the spatial variability of evaporative fraction, EF,
   SM, and the diurnal surface temperature range (T-dr) Intersite
   correlations between EF and T-dr were significantly negative for
   regional average soil moisture SMr < 20 percent, insignificant for 20 <
   SMr< 27 percent, and slightly positive for SM(r)r > 27 percent.
   Statistical analysis of the pooled correlation coefficient between EF
   and T-dr for SMr < 20 percent indicates that it is less than zero at a
   very high level of significance, while the pooled correlation
   coefficient for regional SMr > 27 percent is greater than zero at the 10
   percent level. The positive EF:T-dr correlations are attributed to
   increased surface vapor pressure at warmer sites under nearly potential
   conditions. These results suggest that to characterize the spatial
   variability of the energy budget partitioning, a variable representing
   the thermal response of the site should be included. An important
   application of these findings relates to modeling the subgrid
   variability of a region by subdividing the region into a few classes
   within which surface variables and parameters are assumed invariant. The
   thermal response of the surface should be included as a variable in
   defining these classes.}},

Abstract = {{Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) collected from four sites in the Red River
   of the North in 1994 were analyzed for arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd),
   chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), and
   zinc (Zn). Concentrations differed among liver, muscle, and whole body.
   Generally, trace element concentrations were the greatest in livers
   while concentrations in whole bodies were greater than those in muscle
   for Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn, and concentrations in muscle were similar to
   whole body for As and Se. Concentrations of Cr were lower in liver than
   either muscle or whole body. Correlations between liver and whole body
   concentrations were stronger than those between liver and muscle
   concentrations, but the strongest correlations were between muscle and
   whole body concentrations. Examination of tissue concentrations by
   collection sites suggested that, for a general survey, the whole body
   may be the most effective matrix to analyze.}},

Abstract = {{A device that uses a siphon tube to establish a hydraulic connection
   between the bottom of an onshore standpipe and a point at the bottom of
   a water body was designed and tested for monitoring surface-water
   levels. Water is added to the standpipe to a level sufficient to drive a
   complete slug of water through the siphoning tube and to flush all air
   out of the system. The water levels in the standpipe and the water body
   equilibrate and provide a measurable static water surface in the
   standpipe. The siphon gage was designed to allow quick and accurate
   year-round measurements with minimal maintenance. Currently available
   devices for monitoring surface-water levels commonly involve
   time-consuming and costly installation and surveying, and the movement
   of reference points and the presence of ice cover in cold regions cause
   discontinuity and inaccuracy in the data collected. Installation and
   field testing of a siphon gage using 0.75-in-diameter polyethylene
   tubing at Ashumet Pond in Falmouth, Massachusetts, demonstrated that the
   siphon gage can provide long-term data with a field effort and accuracy
   equivalent to measurement of ground-water levels at an observation well.}},

Abstract = {{The storage function model is a nonlinear rainfall-runoff model that has
   been developed for and applied to flood runoff analysis in Japan. This
   paper extends the model applicability by developing practical equations
   for estimating model parameters which are appropriate on a regional
   basis, i.e., so-called regional equations. Previously, the parameters
   were computed from historical data for a specific basin or from
   relationships that do not account for land use and topography.
   To develop the regionalized equations, model parameters were identified
   for 91 flood events from 22 watersheds in Japan by applying a
   mathematical optimization technique. Results from 39 of these events
   were statistically compared and regional relationships were determined
   as a function of land use, basin area and rainfall intensity. The
   utility of the estimated equations were tested by computing runoff
   hydrographs for lumped basins. The estimated parameters were also
   applied in a distributed watershed model formulation. Both applications
   showed acceptable results that validate the use of the regionalized
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-tier approach for agricultural watershed management has been
   proposed. The approach involves identification of a watershed management
   issue/problem, selection or development of simple conceptual model
   suitable for the exploration of the issue/problem identified and
   appropriate to the database available, and application of the model to
   address the identified issue/problem. The procedure is repeated by
   increasing the complexity in the conceptual model until the identified
   issue/problem has been addressed satisfactorily. An application of the
   procedure to an example watershed in southern Ontario conditions is
   shown. The application example has revealed that for identification of
   temporal pattern of runoff and sediment loads a simple conceptual model
   is adequate. For identification of spatial location of the sediment
   source areas and for the development of a monitoring program for the
   evaluation of remedial strategies a more complex distributed
   agricultural watershed model is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{Road-related erosion was estimated by measuring 100 randomly located
   plots on a 180 km road network in the middle reach of Redwood Creek in
   northwestern California. The estimated erosion rate of 177 m(3) km(-1)
   was contrasted with two earlier studies in nearby parts of the same
   watershed. A sizable proportion of the great reduction in erosion from
   that reported in the earlier studies is attributed to changes in forest
   practice rules. Those changes have resulted in better placement and
   sizing of culverts and, especially, to less reliance on culverts to
   handle runoff from logging roads.}},

Abstract = {{We used a closed-ended viewer box in the measurement of Secchi depth and
   compared the results with simultaneous naked-eye measurements. We have
   shown that use of such a viewer box increases Secchi depth measurement
   by removing the interfering effects of water surface glare and glitter.
   A viewer box also increases between-observer precision. Measurements
   made both with and without the viewer box are slightly greater on the
   shady side of the boat than on the sunny side; the latter is the
   preferred side if Secchi data are to be related to other optical
   properties. As expected, the difference between viewer box and naked eye
   measurements increases with increasing wave height but not with
   increasing illuminance. Because of the lack of uniformity in the way
   Secchi depth is estimated, and the inherent optical problems with
   current Secchi depth procedures, an appeal is made for production of a
   standardized protocol for Secchi observations, including the use of a
   closed-ended viewer box on the sunny side of the boat.}},

Abstract = {{The City of Cape May, New Jersey, draws its primary water supply from
   the Cohansey Aquifer, a unit serving residential, community, and
   industrial users throughout the Coastal Plain. By the year 2000,
   projected population growth will impose a peak water demand beyond
   available supplies. In addition, regional over-pumping threatens the
   Cohansey with saltwater intrusion, placing the city wells at risk by
   1998. In the early-to-mid 1990s, three broad categories of water-supply
   alternatives were evaluated by regional, state, and federal agencies -
   additional pumping from the Cohansey, conjunctive use of the Cohansey
   with other aquifers, and desalination of brackish groundwater. An
   approach was adopted in 1996 which derives up to 2 MGD from desalination
   of brackish groundwater, with the remaining peak demand satisfied by
   shortterm pumpage from existing wells in the Cohansey. The first of two
   wells has been completed, yielding 1.4 MGD of brackish groundwater.
   Similar performance from the second well will exceed the design goal.
   When the initial system comes on line during the summer of 1998, New
   Jersey will have its first public water supply derived from desalinated
   groundwater. The use of desalinated groundwater balances competing
   demands for water resources in the southern Cape Region of New Jersey,
   allowing continued economic growth while reducing human impacts on a
   threatened aquifer.}},

Title = {{Polynomial-based disaggregation of hourly rainfall for continuous
   hydrologic simulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic modeling of urban watersheds for designs and analyses of
   stormwater conveyance facilities can be performed in either an
   event-based or continuous fashion. Continuous simulation requires, among
   other things, the use of a time series of rainfall amounts. However, for
   urban drainage basins, which are typically small, the temporal
   resolution of the rainfall time series must be quite fine, and often on
   the order of 5 to 15 minutes. This poses a significant challenge because
   rainfall-gauging records are usually kept only for hourly or longer time
   steps. The time step sizes in stochastic rainfall generators are usually
   also too large for application to urban runoff modeling situations.
   Thus, there is a need for methods by which hourly rainfall amounts can
   be disaggregated to shorter time intervals. This paper presents and
   compares a number of approaches to this problem, which are based on the
   use of polynomial approximating functions. Results of these evaluations
   indicate that a disaggregation method presented by Ormsbee (1989) is a
   relatively good performer when storm durations are short (2 hours), and
   that a quadratic spline-based approach is a good choice for
   longer-duration storms. Based on these results, the Ormsbee technique is
   recommended because it provides good performance, and can be applied
   easily to long time series of precipitation records. The quadratic
   spline-based approach is recommended as a close second choice because it
   performed the best most consistently, but remains more difficult to
   apply than the Ormsbee technique. Results of this study also indicate
   that, on average, all of the disaggregation methods evaluated introduce
   a severe negative bias into maximum rainfall intensities. This is cause
   for some well-justified concern, as the characteristics of runoff
   hydrographs are quite sensitive to maximum storm intensities. Thus,
   there is a need to continue the search for simple yet effective hourly
   rainfall disaggregation methods.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to develop a methodology for generating storm
   hydrographs at a watershed scale based on daily runoff estimates from a
   field scale model. The methodology was evaluated on a small agricultural
   watershed using the ADAPT field scale process model. A comparison of
   observed and predicted peak flows for 11 of the largest events that
   occurred in a three year period gave r(2) values of 0.84, 0.82, and 0.81
   when the watershed was subdivided into 1, 5, and 10 subwatersheds.
   However, all other statistical measures improved when the watershed was
   subdivided into at least five subwatersheds. Guidelines need to be
   developed on the use of the procedure but it first needs to be evaluated
   on several watersheds that exhibit a range in sizes, land uses, slopes,
   and soil properties.}},

Abstract = {{We develop and compare three regression models for estimating flood
   quantiles at ungaged stream reaches in New Hampshire and Vermont. These
   models emerge from systematic analysis and validation of relations
   between flood magnitude and six candidate predictors reflecting basin
   size, topography, and climate and channel size at 36 gaging stations
   with record lengths exceeding 20 years. Of the candidate predictors,
   bankfull width is most highly correlated with flood magnitude and the
   best prediction equation is based on width. Thus channel geometry is
   closely related to the current hydrologic regime in spite of
   geologically recent glaciation and apparently non-alluvial bank
   materials. We also develop models that use information obtainable from
   maps or GIS. The best of these uses drainage area and drainage-basin
   elevation as predictors, but it is substantially less precise than the
   width-based relation. A third relation using only drainage area as a
   predictor is even less precise but may be useful for some purposes. No
   other single predictors or combinations yielded useful predictions,
   although some had been included in previously-established models for the
   region. Model comparison included examination of residuals generated by
   regression using one-at-a-time suppression of data points and comparison
   with precision obtainable with gaging records of varying lengths.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly composites of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Indices

   compared with detailed hydrologic-model simulation results for five
   watersheds across the United States. Model-simulated monthly evaporation
   values showed high correlations (mean R-2 =.77) with NDVI-derived
   evaporation estimates. These latter estimates, used in a classical water
   balance model, resulted in equally accurate simulations of monthly
   runoff than when the model was run to estimate monthly evaporation via
   soil moisture accounting. Comparison of NDVI-derived evaporation
   estimates with pan data showed promise for transforming NDVI values into
   evaporation estimates under both wet and water-limiting conditions

Abstract = {{The City of Cedar Rapids obtains its municipal water supply from four
   well fields in an alluvial aquifer along the Cedar River in east-central
   Iowa. Since 1992, the City and the U.S. Geological Survey have
   cooperatively studied the groundwater-flow system and water chemistry
   near the well fields. The geochemistry in the alluvial aquifer near the
   Seminole Well Field was assessed to identify potentially reactive
   minerals and possible chemical reactions that produce observed changes
   in water chemistry. Calcite, dolomite, ferrihydrite, quartz,
   rhodochrosite, and siderite were identified as potentially reactive
   minerals by calculating saturation indexes. Aluminosilicate minerals
   including albite, Ca-montmorillonite, gibbsite, illite, K-feldspar, and
   kaolinite were identified as potentially reactive minerals using
   hypothetical saturation indexes calculated with an assumed dissolved
   aluminum concentration of 1 microgram per liter. Balanced chemical
   equations derived from inverse-modeling techniques were used to assess
   chemical reactions as precipitation percolates to the water table.
   Calcite dissolution was predominate, but aluminosilicate weathering,
   cation exchange, and redox reactions also likely occurred.
   Microbial-catalyzed redox reactions altered the chemical composition of
   water infiltrating from the Cedar River into the alluvial aquifer by
   consuming dissolved oxygen, reducing nitrate, and increasing dissolved
   iron and manganese concentrations. Nitrate reduction only occurred in
   relatively shallow (3 to 7 meters below land surface) groundwater near
   the Cedar River and did not occur in water infiltrating to deeper zones
   of the alluvial aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{The planning and developing of water resources to meet the country's
   needs for water supply, flood control, hydroelectric power, irrigation,
   and navigation now needs to take more account of environmental needs and
   regulations. Water resource development is often beneficial to the
   environment, but may also be harmful, as in cases involving salmon and
   various other endangered species. As a national objective, the
   environment must be preserved and in some cases restored; but how can
   this be done consistent with other national objectives, relating to life
   and welfare of human beings? This problem has aroused the concern of
   many engineers and water scientists. As a result, a national conference
   on this subject was held in Chicago in June 1998, as an integral part of
   ASCE's Annual Conference on Water Resources Planning and Management and
   the Annual Conference on Environmental Engineering. At the conclusion of
   that conference, a post-conference meeting was held by a group of
   prominent water resource practitioners. It was concluded at this meeting
   that action should be taken by our government to establish a new form of
   interagency approach, involving the states, as a means of coordination
   in cases of national importance.}},

   Research is needed to develop watershed pollutant loading and receiving
   waters Loading Capacity models that will link wet and dry weather
   pollution loads to the probability of the exceedence of water quality
   standards. The long term impact of traditional Best Management Practices
   as well as ponds and wetlands, must be reassessed to consider long term

   sustainable resource management at the property and watershed scales and
   identifies the most cost-effective policy for enhancing sustainable
   resource management. Economic attributes are determined with an economic
   model and environmental attributes are simulated with an environmental
   model. Input parameters for both models are generated with a geographic
   information system. The decision support system is used to rank five
   LWRMS for a sample of 20 farmers in Missouri's Goodwater Creek watershed
   and for two hypothetical watershed alliance groups. Results indicate
   that the average farmer and the two alliance groups would rank the five
   LWRMS in the same manner. From the viewpoint of the watershed alliance,
   the most preferred LWRMS for the average farmer in the watershed is
   sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Few water budgets exist for specific types of wetlands such as
   peatlands, even though such information provides the basis from which to
   investigate linkages between wetlands and upland ecosystems. In this
   study, we first determined the water budget and then estimated nutrient
   loading from an upland farm field into a 1.5 ha, kettle-block peatland.
   The wetland contains highly anisotropic pest and has no distinct, active
   layer of groundwater flow. We estimated the depth of the active layer
   using Fick's law of diffusion and quantified groundwater flow using a
   chemical mass balance model. Evapotranspiration was determined using
   MORECS, a semi-physical model based on the Penman-Monteith approach.
   Precipitation and surface outflow were measured using physical means.
   Groundwater provided the major inflow, 84 percent (44,418 m(3)) in 1993
   and 88 percent (68,311 m(3)) in 1994. Surface outflow represented 54
   percent (28,763 m(3)) of total outflows in 1993 and 48 percent (37,078
   m(3)) in 1994. A comparison of several published water budgets for
   wetlands and lakes showed that error estimates for hydrologic components
   in this study are well within the range of error estimates calculated in
   other studies. Groundwater inflow estimates and nutrient concentrations
   of three springs were used to estimate agricultural nutrient loading to
   the site. During the study period, nutrient loading into the peatland
   via groundwater discharge averaged 24.74 kg K ha(-1), 1.83 kg total
   inorganic P ha(-1), and 21.81 kg NO3-N ha(-1).}},

Abstract = {{A selenium budget for Lake Powell, Utah-Arizona was determined based on
   selenium loads at the principal stream input sites to and the output
   site from the lake. Based on data collected during 1985-1994, 83 percent
   of the selenium entering Lake Powell is accounted for at the output
   site. The rest of the selenium may be incorporated by lake sediment or
   used by the biota. Considerably more selenium per unit area is produced
   from the Colorado River Basin above the Colorado River-Green River
   confluence than from the Green River Basin and the San Juan River Basin
   combined. The Gunnison River Basin and the Grand Valley in Colorado
   produce an estimated 31 and 30 percent of the selenium that reaches Lake
   Powell, respectively. Irrigation-related activities are thought to be
   responsible for mobilizing 71 percent of the selenium that reaches Lake
   Powell. Selenium concentrations in water at Imperial Dam on the Colorado
   River upstream of the United States-Mexico international border are
   similar to those at the output site of Lake Powell. Therefore, most
   selenium observed in downstream areas of the Colorado River therefore
   probably is derived mostly from the Colorado River Basin above Lake
   Powell.}},

Abstract = {{Border irrigation systems like most of the other surface irrigation
   systems, do not need too much energy and special equipment. Thus, many
   farmers have used this system for a long time. On the other hand, design
   of surface irrigation systems including border irrigation requires many
   input parameters, and need intensive engineering calculations. The
   burden of these requirements probably led the users to experimental
   design of the systems with low efficiencies. However, accurate design
   and high quality optimization of the border irrigation system that can
   result in a highly efficient system is possible.
   In this study, an optimization model for border irrigation system is
   presented. The Hook Jeev's pattern search optimization method in
   conjunction with a general mathematical model of border irrigation is
   used to maximize the irrigation application efficiency. The border
   irrigation storage and distribution efficiencies, border slope and
   length, inflow rate, cutoff time, and the Manning's roughness
   coefficient are selected as constraints. The model is applied to
   field-measured data. The results show that it is possible to select a
   suitable combination of the border system's parameters (border's length,
   inflow rate, and cutoff time) to obtain a maximum application
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The Caloosahatchee River has two major sources of freshwater: one from
   its watershed and the other via an artificial connection to Lake
   Okeechobee. The contribution of each source to the freshwater discharge
   reaching the downstream estuary varies and either may dominate. Routine
   monitoring data were analyzed to determine the effects of total river
   discharge and source of discharge (river basin, lake) on water quality
   in the downstream estuary. Parameters examined were: color, total
   suspended solids, light attenuation, chlorophyll a, and total and
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus. In general, the
   concentrations of color, and total and dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   increased, and total suspended solids decreased, as total discharge
   increased. When the river basin was the major source, the concentrations
   of nutrients (excepting ammonia) and color in the estuary were
   relatively higher than when the lake was the major source. Light
   attenuation was greater when the river basin dominated freshwater
   discharge to the estuary. The analysis indicates that water quality in
   the downstream estuary changes as a function of both total discharge and
   source of discharge. Relative to discharge from the river basin,
   releases from Lake Okeechobee do not detectably increase concentrations
   of nutrients, color, or TSS in the estuary.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Spatially
   Integrated Models for Phosphorus Loading and Erosion (SIMPLE) in
   predicting runoff volume, sediment loss, and phosphorus loading from two
   watersheds. The modeling system was applied to the 334 ha QOD
   subwatershed, part of the Owl Run watershed, located in Fauquier County,
   Virginia, and to the 2240 ha watershed, Battle Branch, located in
   Delaware County, Oklahoma. Simulation runs were conducted at cell and
   field scales, and simulation results were compared with observed data.
   Runoff volume and dissolved phosphorus loading were measured at the
   Battle Branch watershed. Runoff volume, sediment yield, and total
   phosphorus loading were measured at the QOD site. SIMPLE tended to
   underestimate runoff volumes during the dormant period, from November to
   March. The comparison between observed and predicted dissolved
   phosphorus showed better correlation than for observed and predicted
   total phosphorus loading. Cell level simulations provided similar
   estimates of runoff volume and phosphorus loading when compared to field
   level simulations for both watersheds. However, observed sediment yields
   better compared with the values predicted from the cell level simulation
   when compared to field level simulation. Finally, results of model
   evaluation indicated that SIMPLE's predictive ability is acceptable for
   screening applications but not for site-specific quantitative
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting stream eutrophication potential from nonpoint source nutrient
   loading across large temporal and spatial scales is a significant
   problem. In this paper we describe how two physiological indicators of P
   stress of stream biofilms, alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) and
   stored (surplus)P relate to two predictors of P loading: annual P
   loading predicted by the watershed model SIMPLE, and stream
   concentrations of soluble reactive P (SRP) in eight subbasins in the
   Illinois River basin in Oklahoma. Data for APA, surplus P, nutrients and
   water chemistry were obtained at watershed outlets once during the cold
   season and twice during the warm season. There was a negative
   curvilinear relationship between APA and both predictors. Best fit was
   achieved by APA vs. annual predicted P loading. Both SRP and P-load are
   potentially useful to identify subbasins requiring no pollution
   abatement and to establish a regional target for P-load reduction.
   Surplus P is not as useful as APA in establishing these thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{An 18-month field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
   of grass filter strips in removing sediment and various nitrogen species
   from runoff. Runoff was collected from six 3.7 m wide experimental plots
   with 24.7 m long runoff source areas. Two plots had 8.5 m filters, two
   plots had 4.3 m filters, and two plots had no filters. Runoff was
   analyzed for total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen
   (TKN), filtered TKN (FTKN), NH4+-N, and NO3--N. The Mann-Kendall
   nonparametric test for trend (changes in filter effectiveness over time)
   indicated that there were no trends in the yields and concentrations of
   TSS, NO3--N, NH4+-N, TKN, and FTKN for the 8.5 m filter over time. For
   the shorter 4.3 m filters, there were significant upward trends in TKN
   yield and downward trends in TSS, NH4+-N, and FTKN concentrations,
   indicating that trapping efficiency may have started changing with time.
   The Kruskal-Wallis test indicated that the 8.5 m filters reduced median
   yields and concentrations of TSS and all N species, but the 4.3 m
   filters only reduced the median yields and concentrations of TSS,
   NH4+-N, TKN, and the median concentration of FTKN. The 8.5 and 4.3 m
   filters reduced contaminate yields and concentrations from 42 to 90
   percent and from 20 to 83 percent, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need to provide flood protection while maintaining stable bed
   and bank conditions in the riverine system, to stabilize earth
   embankment dams and spillways, and to stabilize highway or railway
   embankments and levee systems. One approach to providing erosion
   protection and stabilization of channel banks, embankments and spill
   conveyances is with articulated concrete block systems. Numerous
   articulated concrete block systems are available for bank stabilization.
   However, prior to field installations few means are available to
   evaluate how well these block systems perform. To assist the designer in
   predicting site specific suitability, a series of hydraulic testing
   protocols have been developed to analyze block system performance. Two
   articulated block system testing protocols are presented to indicate how
   block hydraulic characteristics may be determined and provide
   performance assurance to both the designer and the owner.}},

   the Chernobyl NPP, within an agricultural watershed, to study the

   from the runoff plot both in natural conditions and under artificial
   rainfalls. Beside traditional hydrological methods, new techniques were
   used allowing to consider microtopographical peculiarities of the runoff
   plot and their role in the redistribution of radionuclides. The estimate
   of the annual mass balance for the soil and the radionuclides within the
   runoff plot has shown that, regardless of significant areal variation of
   their concentration, the Cs-137 washout with the solid runoff resulted
   from artificial rainfalls amounts to some 1 percent of its reserves in
   the uppermost 5 cm of the topsoil. The same parameter for the natural
   runoff is lower by an order of magnitude. Both these factors of
   self-purification are about two times less than natural radioactive

Abstract = {{A methodology for assessing reservoir management was applied to the
   historical conflict between winter fish and wildlife flows below Island
   Park Reservoir on Henrys Fork of the Snake River and the fulfillment of
   storage water rights. The methodology consists of (1) identifying
   impacts of flow regulation, (2) quantifying relationships among
   variables affecting physical reservoir fill, and (3) assessing effects
   of these discharges on the fulfillment of water rights in the context of
   a larger system of interrelated reservoirs. Winter (storage season)
   flows are critical to management of fish and wildlife populations below
   Island Park Dam, but flow regulation has resulted in decreased winter
   discharge. Allowable winter flows are a function of inflow, length of
   storage season, reservoir content at the start of storage season, and
   potential for downstream capture of excess storage season water
   discharged at Island Park. Modeling results indicate that winter flows
   in the range of those recommended for fish and wildlife management are
   attainable during average years but not during years when initial
   reservoir content is low. The methodology was successful in quantifying
   information useful to decision makers in a variety of agencies and
   disciplines and could be applied to solve water management problems on
   other regulated river systems.}},

Abstract = {{Typically, infrastructure agencies build massive water projects to serve
   expanding populations in emerging country cities, but collect and treat
   only a fraction of the resulting wastewater. This effluent often
   overwhelms existing sewerage systems and fouls waterways. Cleaning urban
   waterways requires large investments over long terms and the political
   will to make and sustain them. This challenge - difficult in advanced
   countries - becomes daunting with the scarce resources and weak
   institutions typical of emerging countries. This paper presents a
   framework to structure such a strategy, and applies it to Madras, India.
   It consists of three parts: (1) setting a vision through a participatory
   process; (2) macro investments mainly in wastewater treatment that use
   least-cost methods; and (3) micro investments in small projects that
   involve local people and galvanize public support. The macro investment,
   \$350 million for Madras, appears very large, but averages out to \$66
   per capita, far below the \$1,000-\$2,000 typical of advanced country
   cities. Micro projects to be undertaken by Non-Governmental
   Organizations (NGOs) included an independent wastewater monitoring
   program, sanitary upgrading of slums along waterways banks, a cattle
   waste demonstration project, and an industrial pollution survey.
   Together, a macro/micro strategy promises the funding and political will
   to achieve a balanced vision of waterways quality.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{939-955}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The level of macroinvertebrate community impairment was statistically
   related to selected basin and water-quality characteristics in New
   Jersey streams. More than 700 ambient biomonitoring stations were chosen
   to evaluate potential and known anthropogenic effects. Macroinvertebrate
   communities were assessed with a modified rapid-bioassessment approach
   using three impairment ratings (nonimpaired, moderately impaired, and
   severely impaired). Maximum-likelihood multiple logistic-regression
   analysis was used to develop equations defining the probability of
   community impairment above predetermined impairment levels. Seven of the
   original 140 explanatory variables were highly related to the level of
   community impairment. Explanatory variables found to be most useful for
   predicting severe macroinvertebrate community impairment were the amount
   of urban land and total flow of municipal effluent. Area underlain by
   the Reading Prong physiographic region and amount of forested land were
   inversely related to severe impairment. Nonparametric analysis of
   variance on rank-transformed bioassessment scores was used to evaluate
   differences in level of impairment among physiographic regions and major
   drainage areas simultaneously. Rejection of the null hypothesis
   indicated that the levels of impairment among all six physiographic
   regions and five major drainage areas were not equal. Physiographic
   regions located in the less urbanized northwest portion of New Jersey
   were not significantly different from each other and had the lowest
   occurrence of severely impaired macroinvertebrate communities.
   Physiographic regions containing urban centers had a higher probability
   of exhibiting a severely impaired macroinvertebrate community. Analysis
   of major drainage areas indicates that levels of impairment in the
   Atlantic Coastal Rivers drainage area differed significantly from those
   in the Lower Delaware River drainage area.}},

Abstract = {{Suspended sediment samples were collected in west-side tributaries and
   the main stem of the San Joaquin River, California, in June 1994 during
   the irrigation season and in January 1995 during a winter storm. These
   samples were analyzed for 15 organochlorine pesticides to determine
   their occurrence and their concentrations on suspended sediment and to
   compare transport during the irrigation season (April to September) to
   transport during winter storm runoff (October to March). Ten
   organochlorine pesticides were detected during the winter storm runoff;
   seven during the irrigation season. The most frequently detected
   organochlorine pesticides during both sampling periods were p,p'-DDE,
   P,P=DDT, p,p'-DDD, dieldrin, toxaphene, and chlordane. Dissolved samples
   were analyzed for three organochlorine pesticides during the irrigation
   season and for 15 during the winter storm. Moat calculated total
   concentrations of p,p'-DDT, chlordane, dieldrin, and toxaphene exceeded
   chronic criteria for the protection of freshwater aquatic life. At eight
   sites in common between sampling periods, suspended sediment
   concentrations and streamflow were greater during the winter storm
   runoff - median concentration of 3,590 mg/L versus 489 mg/L and median
   streamflow of 162 ft(3)/s versus 11 ft(3)/s. Median concentrations of
   total DDT (sum of p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDT), chlordane,
   dieldrin, and toxaphene on suspended sediment were slightly greater
   during the irrigation season, but instantaneous loads of organochlorine
   pesticides at the time of sampling were substantially greater during the
   winter storm. Estimated loads for the entire irrigation season exceeded
   estimated loads for the January 1995 storm by about 2 to 4 times for
   suspended transport and about 3 to 11 times for total transport.
   However, because the mean annual winter runoff is about 2 to 4 times
   greater than the runoff during the January 1995 storm, mean winter
   transport may be similar to irrigation season transport. This conclusion
   is tentative primarily because of insufficient information on long-term
   seasonal variations in suspended sediment and organochlorine
   concentrations. Nevertheless, runoff from infrequent winter storms will
   continue to deliver a significant load of sediment-bound organochlorine
   pesticides to the San Joaquin River even if irrigation-induced sediment
   transport is reduced. As a result, concentrations of organochlorine
   pesticides in San Joaquin River biota will continue to be relatively
   high compared to other regions of the United States.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the sensitivity of drawdown to four hydraulic
   parameters in unconfined aquifers: horizontal and vertical hydraulic
   conductivity K-r and K-z, storage coefficient S, and specific yield S-y.
   Sensitivity coefficients indicate that the sensitivity varies with time
   for each aquifer parameter, and K-r, K-z, S, and S-y are identifiable
   from recovery test data. An inverse method was used to calculate the
   four parameters from residual drawdowns. Results of application examples
   demonstrate that residual data provide valid information in the
   determination of unconfined aquifer hydraulic parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The 1990s have featured a rapid proliferation of ``watershed
   initiatives{''} in the western United States and elsewhere. Watershed
   initiatives are ad hoc, voluntary associations typically featuring both
   governmental and non-governmental actors organized together to
   collaboratively seek new strategies for addressing water and related
   natural resource problems at physically relevant regional scales. These
   efforts are a response to historical and sociopolitical trends that have
   resulted in increasingly ineffective forums and processes of resource
   management decisionmaking, and that have subordinated the role of local
   stakeholders in problem-solving efforts. In most cases, watershed
   initiatives appear to provide a pragmatic vehicle for resource managers
   and stakeholders to address common concerns in a more efficient manner
   than is otherwise possible, and as such, deserve further application and
   continued support.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in using watershed councils to provide
   information to public natural resource managers, particularly in the
   western states. Watershed councils are composed of interested
   governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders that form to
   collaboratively manage water and other natural resources at the scale of
   a watershed. This research is the first step in a multi-step policy
   analysis designed to answer the question of whether watershed councils
   are an improvement over traditional methods of public involvement in
   natural resource management. This paper outlines why watershed councils
   form and discusses their structure and operation. There is considerable
   variability in terms of watershed councils' goals, their effectiveness,
   stakeholder composition, their involvement in the ``real{''}
   decision-making process, types of participation that are allowed,
   leadership, financing, decision-making procedures, efficiency, and
   temporal scale. These structural components are presented as a framework
   that can be used by researchers to develop criteria to evaluate
   watershed councils.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem management has become an important unifying theme for
   environmental policy in the past decade. Whereas the science of
   ecosystem dynamics suggests that it will remain difficult to define
   ecosystem borders and all of the natural and anthropogenic effects that
   influence them, the politics of ecosystem management require that a
   national ecosystem delineation standard be adopted. Moreover, a
   political framework for ecosystem management decision making must be
   designed in such a way as to complement the hierarchical, interrelated
   nature of ecosystems generally. This paper advocates that a
   watershed-based ecosystem delineation standard is the most politically
   suitable because it will be easily understood by the public and
   watersheds have a long history as a medium of environmental policy. The
   paper then proposes that the political framework for watershed-based
   ecosystem management must depend heavily on state and local autonomy,
   subject to federally prescribed standards and goals. The Coastal Zone
   Management Act provides a model for how a national ecosystem management
   policy can work within state and local watershed cultures and economies.}},

Abstract = {{Improving water management to meet future global needs will certainly
   require technical advances, but the main challenge is to integrate the
   viewpoints of diverse societal interests into decisions about allocation
   of water resources. The integration cannot be done solely by the market
   because it requires a balancing among interests which do not respond
   well to market forces, nor by the state alone because of institutional
   problems. The concept of ``integrated water resources management{''} has
   been developed to provide the framework for the required balancing of
   interests, and, like similar concepts in industries other than water, it
   has a dual purpose - to link stakeholders and apply best practices to
   management actions. To clarify the process of integrated water
   management, the paper focuses on two questions: who should lead
   integrated water resources management and who should pay for it? Several
   examples are given to illustrate a range of situations. The paper
   concludes with a call to improve paradigms of integrated water
   management, a proposition that water organizations should accept and
   budget for their external responsibilities as well as their direct
   missions, affirmation of the need for state and federal agencies to be
   involved with local interests, a call for better scientific and public
   information, and identification of the need for continued work to
   improve the process of integrated water management.}},

Abstract = {{Two major challenges face today's water professionals. The first is
   finding solutions to increasingly complicated water resources problems.
   The second challenge is nontechnical. It is effective interaction with
   the public recognizing both the public's increasingly elevated goals
   relative to water and the public's growing understanding of water
   science and technology. The traditional DAD approach, that is,
   decide-announce-defend, is no longer appropriate. The much more
   progressive, and inclusive POP approach, that is, public owns project,
   is more likely to be effective given the changing nature of the public's
   expectations and knowledge. A water resources planning or design effort
   that fails to include a public interaction program plans to fail.
   Described in this paper are three suggested objectives of the POP
   approach, namely demonstrating awareness, gathering supplemental data
   and information, and building a base of support. Having established
   specific objectives for a particular water resources project,
   appropriate public interaction programs and events must be selected,
   scheduled, and implemented. Many and varied programs and events are
   described in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Statutory and case law at the state level provide critical legal
   frameworks for water management. As many state governments struggle to
   improve efficiency in water management and resolve conflicts over water

   This article presents a methodology to assess state water law and take
   first steps toward a comprehensive state water resources act. The
   methodology is driven by issues and conflicts in water management. It
   synthesizes management and legal analyses into a process that
   incorporates the diverse perspectives of state water stakeholders. The
   results of the analysis are identification of management issues,
   profiles of state water law, and explorations of legal. options that are
   available to the state government. Illinois is provided as a case study

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Protecting surface water quality in watersheds undergoing demographic
   change requires both the management of existing threats and planning to
   address potential future stresses arising from changing land use. Many
   reservoirs and threatened waterbodies are located in areas undergoing
   rapid population growth, and increases in density of residential and
   commercial land use, accompanied by increased amount of impervious
   surface area, can result in increased pollutant loading and degradation
   of water quality. Effective planning to address potential threats,
   including zoning and growth management, requires analytical tools to
   predict and compare the impacts of different management options. The
   focus of this paper is not on developing demographic projections, but
   rather the translation of such projections into changes in land use
   which form the basis for assessment of future watershed loads. Land use
   change can be forecast at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. A
   semi-lumped, GIS-based, transition matrix approach is recommended as
   consistent with the level of complexity achievable in most watershed
   models. Practical aspects of forecasting future land use for watershed
   assessment are discussed. Several recent reservoir water supply
   projection studies are used to demonstrate a general framework for
   simulating changes in land use and resulting impacts on water quality.
   In addition to providing a technical basis for selecting optimal
   management alternatives, such a tool is invaluable for demonstrating to
   different stakeholder groups the trade-offs among management
   alternatives, both in terms of water quality and future land use
   patterns within the watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Social scientists were included in the planning and design for an
   integrated, trans-basin water resource project. Within this complex
   project, a socioeconomic impact assessment (SIA) concentrated on
   identifying the social, political, and economic issues and potential
   impacts inherent in developing a city's water rights. Before the SIA
   began, some of the development alternatives had already generated
   widespread hostility and organized opposition from communities within
   the watershed. The SIA involved residents of affected communities in the
   study design and project planning. The study found a number of
   components that constituted the concerns, beliefs, and expectations
   about perceived, potential impacts that might result from the different
   alternatives. In most cases these issues constituted threats to valued
   environmental resources, valued community resources, the social
   environment, the economic base, and a secure future. The social science
   component was a key factor in the ultimate decision to pursue a
   particular alternative which was sensitive to the social and political
   issues, minimized environmental and socioeconomic impacts, and
   ultimately had support among the communities potentially affected. The
   experience from this case study suggests that the approach used can be
   applied successfully in the planning of other water development projects
   and result in cooperation from the wide range of interest groups that
   often present costly obstacles to such projects.}},

Abstract = {{Successful watershed management requires consideration of multiple
   objectives and the efficient use of scarce public and private resources.
   One way to address these multi-faceted issues is through Social
   Benefit-Cost Accounting (SBCA). SBCA is a systematic method of
   addressing complex social and economic issues relevant to proposed
   watershed management projects. Benefits of using this technique include:
   benefits and costs of watershed projects are better understood;
   politically sensitive issues tend to be put into perspective; and
   stakeholders' interests are placed on a level playing field. An example
   from Bogota, Colombia demonstrates how SBCA can be used to value the
   benefits and costs of a proposed project. By addressing the benefits and
   costs to all stakeholders, the design of watershed management programs
   can be improved to achieve goals in a cost-effective manner.}},

Abstract = {{Water providers nationwide are implementing nonprice conservation
   measures such as education, public information, appliance retrofit and
   ordinances, with the expectation that these programs will reduce
   residential water demand. However, little empirical information exists
   on the effectiveness of nonprice conservation programs in reducing water
   demand. Previous econometric studies indicate these programs have had
   minimal impact. We examine the types and number of major nonprice
   conservation programs that have been implemented during an Ii-year
   period in seven cities in the southwestern United States. A cross
   sectional, monthly time series residential water demand model, with
   parameters to control for variation in prices, temperature,
   precipitation and other factors, was used to empirically investigate the
   effectiveness of nonprice conservation programs in reducing water
   demand. We found significant reductions in use ranging between 1.1
   percent and 4.0 percent per program. Because of the lack of information,
   we were unable to distinguish the effectiveness of individual or
   specific types of programs. Beyond finding that nonprice programs can be
   effective in reducing demand, questions regarding the efficiency and
   benefits to be achieved by conservation remain. As a step towards
   separating and evaluating the effects of individual programs, program
   benefits and efficiency, we recommend that utilities maintain more
   detailed and consistent information regarding the implementation of
   their nonprice programs.}},

Abstract = {{Policy and management plans can be enhanced through effective
   communication between researchers and decision makers. Differences in
   understanding can come from differences in professional cultures.
   Scientists deal with facts, proof and incremental progress whereas the
   decision makers are often faced with perceptions, emotions and
   deadlines. A case study is presented illustrating the interaction
   between the political system and science on a water management issue.
   Irrigation projects in the western San Joaquin Valley of California lead
   to a situation requiring subsurface drainage and disposal of the
   drainage water. The original plan was to discharge the drainage water in
   the Suisun Bay east of the San Francisco Bay. Severe damage to birds
   associated with selenium in the water led to a reevaluation of
   irrigation and drainage management options. Federal and state agencies
   cooperated to establish a San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program (SJVDP)
   which was to develop plans for solving the problem. Discharge to the Bay
   was politically eliminated as an option for evaluation, an action
   criticized by a National Research Council Committee as not being
   scientifically based. The SJVDP published a Management Plan in 1990
   which contained proposals viewed by the scientific community as not
   necessarily incorrect but not completely justified based on the
   scientific knowledge at the time. A segment of the Citizens Advisory
   Committee that was part of the SJVDP consisting of representatives from
   the interest groups viewed the Management Plan as a negotiated agreement
   between the environmental and agricultural interests. Presently, an
   Activity Plan exists, consisting of technical committees to evaluate the
   current technical and economic evaluation of the management options
   proposed in the Management Plan. This case study illustrates that
   factors other than scientific facts have bearing on decisions.
   Successful management plans must be technically sound, economically
   viable and socially acceptable. The scientific community needs to
   evaluate its role in the policy making arena and to focus research on
   questions of greatest value to decision makers, as well as to scientific
   peers.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated watershed management encompasses complex physical and social
   issues that have impacts on environmental resources. A key aspect of
   this holistic effort is public education. Most researchers and
   practitioners agree that an informed public is a crucial part of the
   environmental management process. Yet, educational programs that provide
   stakeholders with information about physical processes in watersheds are
   often unavailable. This paper assesses the effect of an education
   program for residents of the New York City watershed. Surveys evaluated
   certain knowledge levels and attitudes of participants and compared
   three groups: individuals who utilized the educational materials
   completely (full users), those who received the materials but did not
   use them completely (partial users), and watershed residents who did not
   receive the educational program (nonrecipients). Full users displayed a
   higher level of knowledge concerning specific watershed processes than
   did partial users and nonrecipients. In terms of applying that knowledge
   across linked concepts, however, we observed no significant differences
   between the three readership levels. Furthermore, partial users engaged
   in less evaluation of issues that related to the broader watershed
   context. The findings from this project have implications for
   educational and regulatory institutions and program development relating
   to watershed protection.}},

Abstract = {{The Truckee River is a vitally important water source for eastern
   California and western Nevada. It runs 100 miles from Lake Tahoe to
   Pyramid Lake in the Nevada desert and serves urban populations in
   greater Reno-Sparks and agricultural users in three Nevada counties. In
   the 1980s and 1990s, a number of state and focal groups initiated
   projects which, taken collectively have accomplished much to improve
   watershed management on the Truckee River. However, the task of writing
   a management plan for the entire watershed has not yet been undertaken.
   Key players in state, federal and local government agencies have instead
   chosen to focus specific improvement efforts on more manageable,
   achievable goals. The projects currently underway include a new
   agreement on reservoir operation, restoration of high priority
   sub-watersheds, public education and involvement, water conservation
   education, and water resource planning for the major urban population
   centers. The approach which has been adopted on the Truckee River
   continues to evolve as more and more people take an interest in the
   river's future. The many positive projects underway on the watershed are
   evaluated in terms of how well they meet the definition of the ambitious
   water resources strategy, ``integrated watershed management.{''}}},

Abstract = {{The City of Portland's stormwater management program, winner of EPA's
   Environmental Excellence Award for 1996, is committed to
   partnership-based, cost-effective, ``green{''} approaches to healthy
   neighborhoods and water quality. The stormwater program encourages
   innovative, non-structural pollution reduction techniques like native
   landscaping, stormwater pollution reduction bioswales and ponds, and
   public involvement and education.
   Effectiveness of stormwater best management practices (BMPs) has been
   difficult to determine on a citywide basis. Recognizing this problem,
   the City of Portland launched the Parkrose Pilot Project in 1994 to test
   the effectiveness of a wide range of BMPs in a small watershed in north
   Portland, the Parkrose catchment, and monitor the results prior to
   citywide implementation. This catchment was selected because of its
   small size (144 acres), its representative mix of land uses, and an
   extensive record of water quality monitoring data.
   This paper examines the City's strategy in selecting the Parkrose study
   area as a pilot watershed, the BMPs chosen for use in the watershed, and
   the results of the program to date. Final success of the Parkrose
   project will be gauged by the attainment of measurable pollution
   reduction within the catchment while providing opportunities for
   meaningful participation by the local community in achieving water
   quality. Involvement by private citizens in the community is crucial to
   the success of the project and to ensure compliance with the federal
   mandate to reduce pollutants to the maximum extent practicable.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated watershed management in the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain
   (Delta) requires blending federal, state, and local authority. The
   federal government has preeminent authority over interstate navigable
   waters. Conversely, state and local governments have authority vital for
   comprehensive watershed management. In the Delta, integrating three
   broad legal and administrative regimes: (1) flood control, (2)
   agricultural watershed management, and (3) natural resources and
   environmental management, is vital for comprehensive intrastate
   watershed, and interstate river basin management. Federal Mississippi
   River flood control projects incorporated previous state and local
   efforts. Similarly, federal agricultural programs in the River's
   tributary headwaters adopted watershed management and were integrated
   into flood control efforts. These legal and administrative regimes
   implement national policy largely in cooperation with and through
   technical and financial assistance to local agencies such as levee
   commissions and soil and water conservation districts. This
   administrative infrastructure could address new national concerns such
   as nonpoint source pollution which require a watershed scale management
   approach. However, the natural resources and environmental management
   regime lacks a local administrative infrastructure. Many governmental
   and non governmental coordinating organizations have recently formed to
   address this shortcoming in the Delta. With federal and state leadership
   and support, these organizations could provide mechanisms to better
   integrate natural resources and environmental issues into the Delta's
   existing local administrative infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Forces driving the initiation of watershed management activities in
   Alabama have ranged from top-down, agency-led initiatives to bottom-up,
   citizen-led initiatives. A number of watershed projects in Alabama were
   examined including tree NPS projects funded by U.S. EPA grants and a
   more comprehensive locally-initiated watershed management authority.
   Watershed projects were categorized into four different models. Factors
   which produced significant differences in the development and
   utilization of social capital and local capacities for watershed
   management were investigated. The success of watershed management
   initiatives was examined qualitatively and appears to correlate with a
   number of social factors. These factors include the extent of
   stakeholder involvement, the availability of social capital in the
   watershed, and the presence of a real or perceived water resource
   concern or problem. Both short term project success and the longer term
   prognosis for continued watershed management activities seems to depend
   most upon the amount of social capital in the watershed. Two major
   changes in resource management programs and organizations could lead to
   increased focus on and support for local watershed management
   initiatives. These are reorganization of resource management agencies
   around watershed units, and assignment of at least one staff person in
   each watershed unit to watershed management.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Australia's `Landcare' program is a community-based participatory
   program established by government to tackle the problem of land
   degradation. Landcare involves thousands of Australians working together
   in locally based groups, tackling problems of common concern. Government
   and community are now looking to `scale up' the Landcare idea to a
   regional level. State and territory governments have moved to create
   regional (often watershed-based) frameworks for land management planning
   and resource conservation, in accordance with the concept of integrated
   watershed management. Growing out of the success of community
   involvement in Landcare, many of these approaches involve the community.
   However scaling up of the Landcare idea introduces problems of both time
   and space. There have been a number of problems experienced in the
   implementation of Landcare and integrated watershed management. These
   problems include the equitable delineation of membership on
   decision-making bodies; the raising of sufficient funds for program
   implementation; and the coordination of a diversity of governmental
   layers, planning processes and management programs. This paper reviews
   how the State of Victoria has responded to these challenges and suggests
   what challenges remain.}},

Abstract = {{Brazil is currently facing the challenge of implementing a new water
   resources management system to promote the rational and sustainable use
   of the country's waters. This system is based on the following
   principles of water management: (2) stakeholders' participation; (2) the
   watershed as the planning and management unit; and (3) the economic
   value of water. Stakeholders' participation and the involvement of civil
   society in the decision making process is guaranteed by permanent seats
   in the watersheds' management committees. These committees are the
   highest decision level for the establishment of water policy and for
   planning its use. The executive branch of the committees is the
   watershed agency or the water agency. This paper presents the recently
   approved Brazilian water resources management system and discusses the
   participatory approach followed to validate and to ensure prompt
   response to decisions regarding water use by all stakeholders. The
   formulation of the National Water Law (January/1998) was also supported
   by extensive consultation with civil society, professional associations,
   state and municipal governments as well as with federal governmental
   agencies and private sector organizations. It also presents an overview
   of the formulation of the National Water Law. Finally, as watershed
   committees have been created and are already operating in a limited
   number of watersheds, same of the major obstacles to the success of the
   new system are discussed along with alternatives for overcoming such
   obstacles.}},

Abstract = {{Our nation periodically reviews national water policy and considers its
   directions for the future. The most recent examination was directed at
   the western United States and the role of the federal agencies in
   meeting its needs. The West is no longer the frontier, but rather
   contains vibrant cities and booming centers of international trade, as
   well as tourism, mineral, and oil and gas development, agricultural, and
   other development. In this changing environment, federal water policies
   need to consider the long term sustainability of the West, provide
   justice to Indian tribes, protect the rivers and ecosystems on which
   natural systems depend, balance the needs of newcomers with those of
   agricultural users and communities, and meet a myriad of other demands.
   The Western Water Policy Review Advisory Commission has just concluded
   its review of these issues and issued its report. Key among the
   recommendations is the need to coordinate federal agencies at the basin
   and watershed level and make government more responsive to local needs,
   but within a framework that includes national mandates. The Commission's
   recommendations are presented here, along with some of the issues that
   surrounded the operations of the Commission.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Many coastal states are facing increasing urban growth along their coast
   lines. The growth has caused urban nonpoint source nitrogen runoff to be
   a major contributor to coastal and estuarine enrichment. Water resource
   managers are responsible for evaluating the impacts from point and
   non-point sources in developed watersheds and developing strategies to
   manage future growth. Non-point source models provide an effective
   approach to these management challenges. The Agricultural Non-Point
   Source Model (AGNPS) permits the incorporation of important spatial
   information (soils, landuse, topography, hydrology) in simulating sur
   face hydrology and nitrogen non-point source runoff. The AGNPS model was
   adapted for developed coastal watersheds by deriving urban coefficients
   that reflect urban landuse classes and the amount of impervious surface
   area. Popperdam Creek watershed was used for model parameter development
   and model calibration. Four additional watersheds were simulated to
   validate the model. The model predictions of the peak flow and total
   nitrogen concentrations were close to the field measurements for the
   five sub-basins simulated. Measured peak flow varied by 30 fold among
   the sub-basins. The average simulated peak flow was within 14 percent of
   the average measured peak flow. Measured total nitrogen loads varied
   over an order of magnitude among the subbasins yet error between the
   measured and simulated loads for a given sub-basin averaged 5 percent.
   The AGNPS model provided better estimates of nitrogen loads than widely
   used regression methods. The spatial distribution of important watershed
   characteristics influenced the impacts of urban landuse and projecting
   future residential expansion on runoff, sediment and nitrogen yields.
   The AGNPS model provides a useful tool to incorporate these
   characteristics, evaluate their importance, and evaluate field-scale to
   watershed-scale urban impacts.}},

Abstract = {{An approach is developed for incorporating the uncertainty of parameters
   for estimating runoff in the design of polder systems in ungaged
   watersheds. Monte Carlo Simulation is used to derive a set of
   realizations of streamflow hydrographs for a given design rainstorm
   using the U. S. Soil Conservation Service (SCS) unit hydrograph model.
   The inverse of the SCS curve number, which is a function of the
   antecedent runoff condition in the SCS model, is the random input in the
   Monte Carlo Simulation. Monte Carlo realizations of streamflow
   hydrographs are used to simulate the performance of a polder flood
   protection system. From this simulation the probability of occurrence of
   flood levels for a particular hydraulic design may be used to evaluate
   its effectiveness. This approach is demonstrated for the Pluit Polder
   flood protection system for the City of Jakarta, Indonesia. While the
   results of the application indicate that uncertainty in the antecedent
   runoff condition is important, the effects of uncertainty in rainfall
   data, in additional runoff parameters, such as time to peak, in the
   hydraulic design, and in the rainfall-runoff model selected should also
   be considered. Although, the SCS model is limited to agricultural
   conditions, the approach presented herein may be applied to other flood
   control systems if appropriate storm runoff models are selected.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality modeling has been developed for more than three quarters
   of a century, but is limited to the study of trends instead of making
   accurate short-term forecasts. A major barrier to water quality
   forecasting is the lack of an efficient system for water quality
   monitoring. Traditional water quality sampling is time-consuming,
   expensive, and can only be taken for small sizes. Remote sensing
   provides a new technique to monitor water quality repetitively for a
   large area. The objective of this research is to use remotely sensed
   data in a water quality model - QUAL2E in a case study of the Te-Chi
   Reservoir in Taiwan. The water quality variables developed from the
   simulations are displayed in map form. The developed forecasting system
   is designed to predict water quality variables using remote sensing data
   as an input to initialize and update water quality conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The Diama dam is a dike that prevents the upstream intrusion of salt
   water into the lower part of the Senegal River during the low flow
   season. It is possible that a fraction of the salty lands from the delta
   region of the Senegal River will be eventually rendered fit for
   irrigated agriculture as a consequence of the building of this dam. A
   hydrogeologic survey, based on stratigraphic and piezometric data from a
   large monitoring well network, was conducted to describe the
   hydrogeologic setting of the delta alluvial aquifer and to predict the
   surface of reclaimable land. Geostatistical analysis, in particular
   kriging techniques, enables a better description of the spatial
   relationships of the diverse hydrogeologic variables. Since anterior
   studies demonstrated that the area of reclaimable lands depends mainly
   on the thickness of the surface clay layer the geostatistical analysis
   of this variable indicates that from 40 percent to 80 percent of the
   lands of the delta region will eventually be cultivatable. The
   imprecision of this assessment is a result of the difficulty in defining
   a threshold for the appropriate thickness of the clay layer.}},

Abstract = {{Historic changes in stream channel morphology were investigated in the
   Georgia Piedmont to better understand the hydrologic processes and
   functioning of the region's riverine systems. USGS gaging station data
   and channel geomorphology data were collected from thirty study sites in
   the Upper Oconee River Basin for flood frequency analysis. Historic and
   modern (i.e., present-day) channel capacity discharge (i.e., overbank
   flow) was calculated using Manning's equation and historic channel
   cross-section records. The recurrence interval for overbank flow was
   estimated for each site from flood frequency data. Results indicate that
   channel expansion has occurred throughout the basin, especially in upper
   reaches. Recurrence intervals for modern overbank events were variable
   and generally high ranging from < 2 to > 500 years for first to third
   order streams. They were less variable and lower for fourth and fifth
   order streams, ranging from < 2 to 3 years. Potential depositional
   thresholds were identified that exemplify the complex response of
   sediment distribution patterns throughout the basin. Results indicate
   overbank flows occur less frequently now than they once did due to
   historic accelerated sedimentation and subsequent channel expansion. One
   application of these findings is that these basin processes are likely
   applicable across the region and may impact the hydrologic functioning
   of associated Piedmont riverine wetlands that depend on flooding
   regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The impact on water quality by agricultural activity in karst terrain is
   an important consideration for resource management within the
   Appalachian Region. Karst areas comprise about 18 percent of the
   Region's land area. An estimated one-third of the Region's farms,
   cattle, and agricultural market value are on karst terrain. The purpose
   of this study was to compare fecal bacteria densities in karst
   groundwater impacted by two primary agricultural land uses in central
   Appalachia. Fecal bacteria densities were measured in cave streams
   draining two primary land management areas. The first area was pasture
   serving a beef cow-calf operation. The second area was a dairy. Neither
   area had best management practices in place for controlling animal
   wastes. Median fecal coliform and fecal streptococcus densities were
   highest in cave streams draining the dairy. Median fecal coliform
   densities in the daily-impacted stream were greater than 4,000 CFU/100
   ml and the median fecal coliform densities in the pasture-impacted
   streams were less than TO CFU/100 ml. Median fecal streptococcus
   densities in the same streams were greater than 2,000 CFU/100 ml and 32
   CFU/100 ml, respectively. A second dairy, with best management practices
   for control of animal and milkhouse waste, did not appear to be
   contributing significant amounts of fecal bacteria to the karst aquifer.
   It was concluded that agriculture was affecting bacterial densities in
   the karat aquifer. New management practices specifically designed to
   protect karst groundwater resources may be one way to protect the
   groundwater resource.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric deposition can be a significant source of phosphorus to
   South Florida's aquatic system. Deposition samples are often
   contaminated to varying degrees by bird droppings or other foreign
   materials. This study attempted to use statistical and other methods to
   detect and remove the outliers in the rain-borne total phosphorus
   concentration data. Some outliers in the data were identified using
   field notes derived from visual inspection of the samples. Outlier
   detection statistics based on a simple linear regression were then used
   for additional data screening. As a result of these analyses, about 35
   percent of the observed values were identified as outlying data which
   needed to be removed prior to further data analyses. Based on detected
   outliers in the data from 15 monitoring sites, a lumped cutoff value of
   130 mu g/L was determined. This lumped cutoff value may be useful for
   further quality control and analyses of the data from the region.}},

Abstract = {{The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) has been calculated for about
   30 years as a means of providing a single measure of meteorological
   drought severity. It was intended to retrospectively look at wet and dry
   conditions using water balance techniques. The Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) is a probability index that was developed to
   give a better representation of abnormal wetness and dryness than the
   Palmer indices. Before the user community will accept the SPI as an
   alternative to the Palmer indices, a standard method must be developed
   for computing the index. Standardization is necessary so that all users
   of the index will have a common basis for both spatial and temporal
   comparison of index values. If different probability distributions and
   models are used to describe an observed series of precipitation, then
   different SPI values may be obtained. This article describes the effect
   on the SPI values computed from different probability models as well as
   the effects on dry event characteristics. It is concluded that the
   Pearson Type III distribution is the ``best{''} universal model, and
   that the reliability of the SPI is sample size dependent. It is also
   concluded that because of data limitations, SPIs with time scales longer
   than 24 months may be unreliable. An internet link is provided that will
   allow users to access Fortran 77 source code for calculating the SPI.}},

Abstract = {{The successful design of constructed wetlands requires a continuous
   supply of water or vegetation that can withstand drought conditions.
   Having a constant water source is the best alternative to insure species
   diversity throughout the season. Consequently, detention structure
   designs should be based on times between events as well as on hydrologic
   return periods, since between events is when most evaporation and
   infiltration losses are likely to occur. In arid or semi-arid
   environments, this is a difficult process because of long interevent
   times and seasonal changes in precipitation patterns. This discussion is
   predicated on the assumption that phytoplankton, epiphytic algae, and
   emergent vegetation require moist conditions to be effective at removing
   nutrients, metals and other pollutants. There are drought tolerant
   species of vegetal;ion that can be used in constructed wetlands but it
   may take several days to re-establish the attached bacteria communities
   necessary for optimum pollutant removal. This paper examines a
   stochastic framework to examine the probability of extended dry periods
   based on historic rainfall data. The number of consecutive dry days is
   selected for a specified level of assurance. By multiplying this value
   by the sum of daily system losses, an overall pond volume can be
   determined that ensures a minimum depth of water. To illustrate the
   utility of the approach, the method is applied to a site in Spokane,
   Washington.}},

Abstract = {{The nonlinear least squares (NLS) method was applied to pumping and
   recovery aquifer test data in confined and unconfined aquifers with
   finite diameter and partially penetrating pumping wells, and with
   partially penetrating piezometers or observation wells. It was
   demonstrated that noiseless and moderately noisy drawdown data from
   observation points located less than two saturated thicknesses of the
   aquifer from the pumping well produced an exact or acceptable set of
   parameters when the diameter of the pumping well was included in the
   analysis. The accuracy of the estimated parameters, particularly that of
   specific storage, decreased with increases in the noise level in the
   observed drawdown data. With consideration of the well radii, the
   noiseless drawdown data from the pumping well in an unconfined aquifer
   produced good estimates of horizontal and vertical hydraulic
   conductivities and specific yield, but the estimated specific storage
   was unacceptable. When noisy data from the pumping well were used, an
   acceptable set of parameters was not obtained. Further experiments with
   noisy drawdown data in an unconfined aquifer revealed that when the well
   diameter was included in the analysis, hydraulic conductivity, specific
   yield and vertical hydraulic conductivity may be estimated rather
   effectively from piezometers located over a range of distances from the
   pumping well. Estimation of specific: storage became less reliable for
   piezometers located at distances greater than the initial saturated
   thickness of the aquifer.
   Application of the NLS to field pumping and recovery data from a
   confined aquifer showed that the estimated parameters from the two;
   tests were in good agreement only when the well diameter was included in
   the analysis. Without consideration of well radii, the estimated values
   of hydraulic conductivity from the pumping and recovery tests were off
   by a factor of four.}},

   withdrawals and water loss through interbasin transfers. Impacts were
   simulated using base flow values selected from two U.S. Geological
   Survey (USGS) continuous record streamflow sites located within the
   Pinelands of southern New Jersey. Study site base flows were regressed
   against index site base flows with monotonic and step trend tests
   applied to the residuals from the regression model. The smallest,
   significantly detectable (alpha = 0.10) percentage reduction within a
   given simulation was used as an estimate of the sensitivity of a trend
   test. Evaluation of the trend analysis methodology led to the following
   practical considerations regarding trend test sensitivity. The
   proportion of study site base flow variability explained by index site
   base flows should be maximized, while at the same time minimizing
   positive, first-order autocorrelation in the regression residuals. Given
   the importance of detecting autocorrelation, missing values should be
   avoided or minimized. The quarterly (three-month) interval reduced the
   magnitude of autocorrelation relative to a shorter two-month sampling
   interval. Sensitivity appeared to improve when equalizing the number of
   values before and after a base flow impact(s) while seasonally biased
   sampling appeared to reduce sensitivity. Based primarily on past trend
   detection studies, nonparametric tests were deemed a better choice over
   their parametric counterparts, due to the lack of stringent data
   distributional requirements coupled with little or no loss of power even
   when applied to normally distributed data.}},

Abstract = {{Recent developments in water quality monitoring have generated interest
   in combining non-probability and probability data to improve water
   quality assessment. The Interagency Task Force on Water Quality
   Monitoring has taken the lead in exploring data combination
   possibilities. In this paper we take a developed statistical algorithm
   for combining the two data types and present an efficient process for
   implementing the desired data augmentation. In a case study simulated
   Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Environmental Monitoring and
   Assessment Program (EMAP) probability data are combined with auxiliary
   monitoring station data. Auxiliary stations were identified on the
   STORET water quality database. The sampling frame is constructed using
   ARC/INFO and EPA's Reach File-3 (RF3) hydrography data. The procedures
   for locating auxiliary stations, constructing an EMAP-SWS sampling
   frame, simulating pollutant exposure, and combining EMAP and auxiliary
   stations were developed as a decision support system (DSS). In the case
   study with EMAP, the DSS was used to quantify the expected increases in
   estimate precision. The benefit of using auxiliary stations in EMAP
   estimates was measured as the decrease in standard error of the
   estimate.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the application of the organophosphate insecticide diazinon in
   the San Joaquin River Basin occurs in winter to control wood-boring
   insects in dormant almond orchards. A federal-state collaborative study
   found that diazinon accounted for most of the observed toxicity of San
   Joaquin River water in February 1993. Previous studies focused mainly on
   west-side inputs to the San Joaquin River. In this 1994 study, the three
   major east-side tributaries to the San Joaquin River - the Merced,
   Tuolumne, and Stanislaus rivers - and a downstream site on the San
   Joaquin River were sampled throughout the hydrographs of a late January
   and an early February storm. In both storms, the Tuolumne River had the
   highest concentrations of diazinon and transported the largest load of
   the three tributaries. The Stanislaus River was a small source in both
   storms. On the basis of previous storm sampling and estimated travel
   times, ephemeral west-side creeks probably were the main diazinon source
   early in the storms, whereas the Tuolumne and Merced rivers and
   east-side drainages directly to the San Joaquin River were the main
   sources later. Although 74 percent of diazinon transport in the San
   Joaquin River during 1991-1993 occurred in January and February,
   transport during each of the two 1994 storms was only 0.05 percent of
   the amount applied during preceding dry periods. Nevertheless, some of
   the diazinon concentrations in the San Joaquin River during the January
   storm exceeded 0.35 mu g/L, a concentration shown to be acutely toxic to
   water fleas. On the basis of this study and previous studies, diazinon
   concentrations and streamflow are highly variable during January and
   February storms, and frequent sampling is required to evaluate transport
   in the San Joaquin River Basin.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of process domains is proposed as an alternative to the
   River Continuum Concept for the influence of geomorphic processes on
   aquatic ecosystems. Broadly defined, the Process Domain Concept is a
   multi-scale hypothesis that spatial variability in geomorphic processes
   governs temporal patterns of disturbances that influence ecosystem
   structure and dynamics. At a coarse scale, regional climate, geology,
   vegetation, and topography control the suite of geomorphic processes
   that are distributed over a landscape. Within the broad context so
   defined, stream channel classification can guide identification of
   functionally similar portions of a channel network, but the response of
   otherwise similar reaches can depend upon their geologic and geomorphic
   context. Within geomorphic provinces defined by differences in
   topography, climate history, and tectonic setting, areas with generally
   similar geology and topography define lithotopo units, which are useful
   for stratifying different suites of dominant geomorphic processes.
   Process domains are spatially identifiable areas characterized by
   distinct suites of geomorphic processes, and the Process Domain Concept
   implies that channel networks can be divided into discrete regions in
   which community structure and dynamics respond to distinctly different
   disturbance regimes. The concepts of process domains and lithotopo units
   provide both a framework for the application of patch dynamics concepts
   to complex landscapes and a context for addressing the effects of
   watershed processes on the ecology of mountain drainage basins.}},

Abstract = {{To quantify and model the natural ground water recharge process, six
   sites located in the midwest and eastern United States where previous
   water balance observations had been made were compared to computerized
   techniques to estimate: (1) base flow and (2) ground water recharge.
   Results from an existing automated digital filter technique for
   separating baseflow from daily streamflow records were compared to
   baseflow estimates made in the six water balance studies. Previous
   validation of automated baseflow separation techniques consisted only of
   comparisons with manual techniques. In this study, the automated digital
   filter technique was found to compare well with measured field estimates
   yielding a monthly coefficient of determination of 0.86. The recharge
   algorithm developed in this study is an automated derivation of the
   Rorabaugh hydrograph recession curve displacement method that utilizes
   daily streamflow. Comparison of annual recharge from field water balance
   measurements to those computed with the automated recession curve
   displacement method had coefficients of determination of 0.76 and
   predictive efficiencies of 71 percent. Monthly estimates showed more
   variation and are not advocated for use with this method. These
   techniques appear to be fast, reproducible methods for estimating
   baseflow and annual recharge and should be useful in regional modeling
   efforts and as a quick check on mass balance techniques for shallow
   water table aquifers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{425-432}},

Abstract = {{Recharge is an important parameter for models that simulate water and
   contaminant transport in unconfined aquifers. Unfortunately,
   measurements of actual recharge are not usually available causing
   recharge to be estimated or possibly added to the calibration procedure.
   In this study, differences between observed water-table elevations and
   water-table elevations simulated with a model based on the
   one-dimensional Boussinesq equation were used to identify both the
   timing and quantity of recharge to an alluvial valley aquifer. Observed
   water table elevations and river stage data were recorded during a
   five-year period from 1991 to 1995 at the Ohio Management Systems
   Evaluation Area located in southcentral Ohio. Direct recharge attributed
   to overbank flow during and shortly after flood conditions accounted for
   65 percent of the total recharge computed during the five-year study
   period. Recharge of excess infiltration to the aquifer was intermittent
   and occurred soon after large rainfall events and high river stage.
   Specification of constant recharge with time values in ground-water
   simulation models seems inappropriate for stream-aquifer systems given
   the strong influence of the river on water table elevations in these
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical equations that establish the relationship between sediment

   concentration in the bulk water already exist. These theoretical
   equations for oxygen consumption in the sediment express biological
   consumption with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and chemical consumption by
   a first order reaction. Data from laboratory experiments that were
   conducted to validate the theoretical equations also exist. These
   experiments were performed in a laboratory channel with well defined
   flow characteristics for three types of sediments. Herein, the
   theoretical equations are used to model the experimental data for the
   three types of sediments. The values used for the parameters in the
   theoretical equations are determined by iteration until a best fit is
   obtained for the relationship of SOD to flow velocity from both the
   theoretical model and experimental data. The goodness of fit is measured

   simulations in 1987 and 1990 was 105 percent greater on streambank
   wheatgrass plots than on crested wheatgrass plots. Total runoff and soil
   loss from natural rainfall and snowmelt events during 1987 were 25 and
   105 percent greater, respectively, on streambank wheatgrass plots than
   on crested wheatgrass plots. Thus, crested wheatgrass appears to be
   better suited in revegetation of waste burial covers at INEEL than
   streambank wheatgrass due to its much lower erosion rate and only
   slightly higher infiltration rate (lower runoff rate).}},

Abstract = {{An evaluation was conducted on three forested upland watersheds in the
   northeastern U.S. to test the suitability of TOPMODEL for predicting
   water yield over a wide range of climatic scenarios. The analysis
   provides insight of the usefulness of TOPMODEL as a predictive tool for
   future assessments of potential long-term changes in water yield as a
   result of changes in global climate. The evaluation was conducted by
   developing a calibration procedure to simulate a range of climatic
   extremes using historical temperature, precipitation, and streamflow
   records for years having wet, average, and dry precipitation amounts
   from the Leading Ridge (Pennsylvania), Fernow (West Virginia), and
   Hubbard Brook (New Hampshire) Experimental Watersheds. This strategy was
   chosen to determine whether the model could be successfully calibrated
   over a broad range of soil moisture conditions with the assumption that
   this would be representative of the sensitivity necessary to predict
   changes in streamflow under a variety of climate change scenarios. The
   model calibration was limited to a daily time step, yet performed
   reasonably well for each watershed. Model efficiency, a least squares
   measure of how well a model performs, averaged between 0.64 and 0.78. A
   simple test of the model whereby daily temperatures were increased by
   1.7 degrees C, resulted in annual water yield decreases of 4 to 15
   percent on the three watersheds. Although these results makes the
   assumption that the model components adequately describe the system,
   this version of TOPMODEL is capable to predict water yield impacts given
   subtle changes in the temperature regime. This suggests that adequate
   representations of the effects of climate change on water yield for
   regional assessment purposes can be expected using the TOPMODEL concept.}},

Abstract = {{Cone-penetrometer testing and computer modeling were utilized to
   investigate factors controlling fresh-water lens formation at Grand
   Isle, Louisiana. Measurements of tip resistance, sleeve friction, and
   electrical conductivity were recorded with depth to permit
   classification of sediment type and to determine thickness of the
   fresh-water lens and transition zone. Cone-penetrometer testing provided
   virtually continuous determinations of change in sediment type and
   ground-water salinity at a resolution rarely achieved using conventional
   drilling and water sampling techniques.
   Three sand bodies are present, each separated by a clay layer. The
   fresh-water lens is thinner in the center of the island than on the
   flanks. Fresh-water lens thickness is limited by a clay layer which
   prohibits downward movement of significant volumes fresh water. The
   transition zone from fresh water to salt water varies in thickness,
   being thinnest near the Gulf of Mexico and thickest where silt and clay
   interfinger with the upper sand.
   Both the thickness of the fresh-water lens and the shape of the
   transition zone differ from that predicted by theoretical models.
   Calibration of SUTRA, a variable-density solute-transport model,
   indicates that permeability variations are the dominant control on
   formation of the fresh-water lens.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic monitoring aims to assess the condition of aquatic habitats and
   biota. To make statements about condition, the range of human activities
   and the risks they pose to aquatic ecosystems must be identified.
   Assessing relative risk and placing sample sites on a human disturbance
   gradient is necessary for interpreting biological response and
   distinguishing human disturbance from natural controls in aquatic
   systems. We describe a process that uses readily available sources, such
   as topographic maps, aerial photographs, and field information, to
   identify and prioritize stream reach and watershed stressors for 102
   streams in the mid-Appalachian region of the United States. All
   perceptible human alterations to riparian and upland areas along with
   their number, type, intensity, and extent of impact were recorded and
   ranked; a relative risk index was developed to assign scores to the
   watersheds. The resulting risk index scores were consistent with
   measures of stream condition based on water chemistry and benthic

Abstract = {{Water resources are the lifeblood of the Near East region. Careful
   planning and management of water resources in dry land regions requires
   information on the likelihood of extreme events, especially prolonged
   drought. It is essential to understand the variability of climate on
   time scales of decades to centuries to assign reasonable probabilities
   to such events. Tree-ring analysis is one way to increase our knowledge
   of the climate variability beyond the short period covered by the
   instrumental data. In this paper, we reconstruct October-May
   precipitation from a Juniperus phoenicia tree-ring chronology in
   southern Jordan to gain a longterm (A.D. 1600-1995) perspective on runs
   of dry years and on time series fluctuations in precipitation averaged
   over several years. The reconstruction equation derived by regression of
   log-transformed precipitation on tree-ring indices explains 44 percent
   of the variance of observed precipitation. The longest reconstructed
   drought, as defined by consecutive years below a threshold of 217.4 mm,
   was four years, compared with three years for the 1946-95 instrumental
   data. A Monte Carlo analysis designed to account for uncertainty in the
   reconstruction indicates a lower than 50 percent chance that the region
   has experienced drought longer than five years in the past 400 years.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this paper were to test the ability of various design
   storm distributions to simulate the actual rainfall pattern and to
   compare the runoff rates used in the design of stormwater management
   devices in the State of Florida using continuous simulation approach.
   The analyses were performed for four gaged stations to evaluate the
   applicability of design storm distributions in different parts of the
   State of Florida.
   The approach used in this study compared the peak runoff rates from
   design storms based on the various distributions to those that would
   result from actual rainfall events. A series of continuous runoff rates
   were developed through the use of actual fifteen-minute recorded
   rainfall data, Horton type infiltration decay and recovery rate, and a
   continuous simulation model. The runoff rates were analyzed using
   frequency distributions to obtain peak runoff rates associated with
   different return periods based on the assumption that the continuous
   simulation approach closely predicts the actual runoff rates from the
   gaged stations. The results show that the behavior of the design storm
   distributions varies for different watershed characteristics in
   different parts of the state. The study also suggests that in general
   the Florida Department of Transportation and the Suwanne River Water
   Management (FDOT/SRWMD) distributions appeared to agree with the
   continuous simulation results.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-82}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between
   precipitation at the seasonal and annual scale and water discharge per
   surface area for seven contiguous first- and second-order tributaries of
   the Rhode River, a small tidal tributary to Chesapeake Bay, Maryland,
   USA. The goal was to quantify the effects of a wide range of
   precipitation, representative of interannual variations in weather in
   this region. The discharges measured included both overland storm flows
   and groundwater, since the aquifers were perched on a clay aquiclude.
   Precipitation varied from 824 to 1684 mm/yr and area-weighted Rhode
   River watershed discharge varied from 130 to 669 mm/yr with an average
   of 332 mm/yr or 29.1 percent of average precipitation. Average annual
   discharges from three first-order watersheds were significantly lower
   per surface area and varied from 16.0 to 21.9 percent of precipitation.
   Winter season precipitation varied from 125 to 541 mm. Area-weighted
   Rhode River winter discharge varied from 26.3 to 230 mm with an average
   of 115 mm or 43.9 percent of average precipitation. Spring season
   precipitation varied from 124 to 510 mm and watershed discharge varied
   from 40.0 to 321 mm with an average of 138 mm or 46.9 percent of average
   precipitation. In the summer and fall seasons, watershed discharge
   averaged 40.6 and 40.9 mm or 13.5 and 14.3 percent of average
   precipitation, respectively Except in winter, the proportion of
   precipitation discharged in the streams increased rapidly with
   increasing volume of precipitation. Stream order showed a higher
   correlation with volume of discharge than vegetative cover on the
   watershed.}},

Abstract = {{Erosion and sedimentation data from research watersheds in the Silver
   Creek Study Area in central Idaho were used to test the prediction of
   logging road erosion using the R1-R4 sediment yield model, and sediment
   delivery using the ``BOISED{''} sediment yield prediction model. Three
   small watersheds were instrumented and monitored such that erosion from
   newly constructed roads and sediment delivery to the mouths of the
   watersheds could be measured for four years following road construction.
   The errors for annual surface erosion predictions for the two standard
   road tests ranged from +31.2 t/ha/yr (+15 percent) to -30.3 t/ha/yr (-63
   percent) with an average of zero t/ha/yr and a standard deviation of the
   differences of 18.7 t/ha/yr. The annual prediction errors for the three
   watershed scale tests had a greater range from -40.8 t/ha/yr (-70
   percent) to +65.3 t/ha/yr (+38 percent) with a mean of -1.9 t/ha/yr and
   a standard deviation of the differences of 25.2 t/ha/yr. Sediment yields
   predicted by BOISED (watershed scale tests) were consistently greater
   (average of 2.5 times) than measured sediment yields. Hillslope sediment
   delivery coefficients in BOISED appear to be overly conservative to
   account for average site conditions and road locations, and thus
   over-predict sediment delivery. Mass erosion predictions from BOISED
   appear to predict volume well (465 tonnes actual versus 710 tonnes
   predicted, or a 35 percent difference) over 15 to 20 years, however mass
   wasting is more episodic than the model predicts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a computer-aided tool for selecting optimal
   management policies involving groundwater hydraulics over a large number
   of management periods. The tool, referred to as DOMODF, uses a dynamic
   optimization algorithm linked to an existing popular groundwater flow
   simulation code MODFLOW. It combines the expert knowledge of management
   policies with the effectiveness of optimization oriented search
   technique. Due to the dynamic nature of the search technique implemented
   in DOMODF, it is effective in dealing with long-term decision making
   problems. DOMODF can be used as a guidance tool for finding desirable
   policies to achieve various groundwater management objectives, leading
   to considerable savings in management costs over those predicted by
   currently available policies that are fed into the tool as input. The
   preliminary test results show the promising potential of DOMODF as an
   effective long-term groundwater management tool.}},

Abstract = {{In this study three components of the Rosgen Level III Stream Reach
   Condition Assessment were tested for their ability to predict short-term
   erosion rates. Rosgen's bank erosion potential (BEP) ratings and near
   bank stress (NBS) estimates and the Pfankuch channel stability ratings
   were evaluated. Thirty-six banks with a range of BEP ratings and NBS
   estimates were selected on the 101 km Upper Illinois River in northeast
   Oklahoma. The Upper Illinois River is a meandering, gravel-dominated,
   riffle/pool channel. Cumulative erosion data measured with bank pins
   after four 2.0 to 2.5-year return period flows from September 1996 to
   July 1997 were used in the analyses. When integrated as indicated in
   Rosgen (1996), the BEP indices and NBS estimates were poor predictors of
   bank erosion. Individually, the grouped BEP ratings and Pfankuch ratings
   performed relatively well compared to grouped NBS estimates in
   predicting erosion; however, the variability of erosion was large within
   each rating group. Linear regression between erosion and BEP numerical
   indices and Pfankuch scores was significant (alpha = 0.05), but
   variability was high (illustrated by low r(2) values). Regression
   between erosion and NBS estimates was not significant.}},

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Declining ground-water levels and spring discharges have heightened
   water user concerns about the sustainability of the Snake River Plain
   aquifer in southern Idaho. Diminished recharge from surface water
   irrigation and increased irrigation pumping have been depleting the
   aquifer at a rate of about 350,000 acre-feet/year. Previously, aquifer
   conditions were treated as an uncontrollable consequence of weather and
   development activities. With increasing competition for available water,
   the State appears to be progressing through a three-stage process of
   recharge management. The first stage is that which has occurred
   historically where recharge is largely an incidental effect of surface
   water irrigation. The second stage is the implementation of intentional
   recharge with little regard to identifying or maximizing benefits. Idaho
   has been at this stage for the past few years. The State is entering a
   third stage in which recharge sites will be located and designed to meet
   specific water user and environmental objectives. Preliminary estimates
   using numerical and analytical models demonstrate that managed recharge
   within a few miles of the river will result in short-term increases in
   spring discharge. More distant recharge sites are needed to provide
   longer-term benefits. The primary challenge facing implementation of the
   managed recharge program will be the balancing of economic and
   environmental costs and benefits and to whom they accrue.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the flow processes, solute-transport processes, and
   ground-water/surface-water interactions on the Santa Clara River in
   Ventura County, California, a 24-hour fluorescent-dye tracer study was
   performed under steady-state flow conditions on a 45-km reach of the
   river. The study reach includes perennial (uppermost and lowermost)
   subreaches and ephemeral subreaches of the lower Piru Creek and the
   middle Santa Clara River. The tracer-test data were used to calibrate a
   one-dimensional flow model (DAFLOW) and a solute-transport model (BLTM).
   The dye-arrival times at each sample location were simulated by
   calibrating the velocity parameters in DAFLOW. The simulations of dye
   transport indicated that (1) ground-water recharge explains the loss of
   mass in the ephemeral middle subreaches, and (2) groundwater recharge
   does not explain the loss of mass in the perennial uppermost and
   lowermost subreaches. The observed tracer curves in the perennial
   subreaches were indicative of sorptive dye losses, transient storage,
   and (or) photodecay - these phenomena were simulated using a linear
   decay term. However, analysis of the linear decay terms indicated that
   photodecay was not a dominant source of dye loss.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic organisms passively accumulate hydrophobic organic compounds,
   such as polychlorinated biphenyls, even when ambient water
   concentrations of the contaminant are below analytical detection limits.
   However, contaminant concentrations in tissue samples are subject to an
   inherently high level of variability due to differences in species, life
   stage, and gender bioconcentration potentials. Semipermeable membrane
   devices (SPMDs) were used to sample Aroclor 1254, a mixture of readily
   bioconcentrated polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in a contaminated
   wetland near Flat Top, WV. The devices consisted of triolein, a lipid
   found in fish, enclosed in a polyethylene membrane. SPMDs were deployed
   in the water column and in direct contact with wetland sediments along a
   previously identified concentration gradient of PCBs. The devices were
   retrieved after a 25-day exposure period. Analytes were recovered by
   dialyzing the devices in nanograde hexane. Hexane dialysates were
   condensed and analyzed by gas chromatography. All deployed devices
   sequestered quantifiable amounts of Aroclor 1254. Water-column SPMDs
   accumulated PCBs far in excess of ambient water concentrations. The
   devices contacting sediments accumulated PCBs at all sites, though
   accumulated concentrations did not exceed concentrations in sediment.
   Patterns of PCB concentration in the devices corresponded to the
   identified gradient at the site. Results from the water-column SPMDs
   were used to estimate the concentration of the dissolved, bioavailable
   fraction of PCBs present in the water column. These concentrations
   ranged from 0.01 to 0.09 mu g/L of bioavailable Aroclor 1254.}},

Abstract = {{Land application of organic soil amendments can increase runoff
   concentrations of metals such as Fe and Zn, metalloids such as B and As,
   and non-metals such as P and S that have the potential for causing
   adverse environmental impacts. Aluminum sulfate, or alum
   (Al-2(SO4)(3).(14H(2)O), can reduce concentrations of some materials in
   runoff from sites treated with organic amendments. The objectives of
   this study were to (a) quantify concentrations of selected constituents
   (Al, As, B, Ca, Cd, Co, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, P, Pb, S, Se, Ti, and Zn)
   in runoff from plots treated with horse manure (mixed with stall
   bedding) and municipal sludge, (b) assess runoff quality effects of alum
   addition to those treatments, and (c) determine time variations in
   concentrations of the constituents. Horse manure and municipal sludge
   were applied to twelve 2.4 by 6.1 m fescue plots (six each for the
   manure and sludge). Alum was added to three of the manure-treated and
   three of the sludge-treated plots. Simulated rainfall (64 mm/h) was
   applied to the 12 treated plots and to three control (no treatment)
   plots. The first 0.5 h runoff was sampled and analyzed for the
   constituents described above. Addition of manure or sludge had no effect
   on runoff concentrations of the majority of constituents. In some cases
   (e.g., Al, As, Fe, Zn), however, concentrations were near or in excess
   of threshold values recommended for marine wildlife protection. Alum
   addition increased runoff of Al, Ca, K, and S, due likely to its
   composition and by the addition of lime to counteract the acidity of
   alum. Concentration decreases of more than 50 percent were noted for P
   for the horse manure treatment. No alum effect was detected for P in
   runoff from the sludge-treated plots, possibly due to relatively stable
   P forms in the sludge. Runoff concentrations of Al, As, Fe, K, Mn, and P
   followed an approximately first-order decline with respect to time.
   Runoff concentrations of Ca and S, however, peaked during the second
   runoff sample (four minutes following initiation of runoff), suggesting
   that differences in mobility and/or transport mechanisms exist among the
   materials investigated.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred and sixty-two rainfall-induced soil erosion tests were
   conducted to assist in predicting soil loss and subsequent increase in
   total suspended solids leaving a highway construction site during a
   rainfall event. A rainfall simulator and a water flume were constructed
   for the tests. Soil shear strength, compressive strength, rainfall
   intensity, and soil bed slope were treated as variables during the
   experiments. The soil with a higher shear strength resisted soil erosion
   better than lower strength soils. Soil loss was nearly independent of
   shear strength at low rainfall intensity but at high intensities, the
   shear strength was more important in resisting soil loss. Lower soil
   loss can be expected for cohesive soils if the compressive strength is
   high.}},

   are no continental hydrological models. Instead, hydrological models
   continue to develop at the catchment scale and the land phase component
   of the global hydrologic cycle is modeled as parameterizations within
   atmospheric models. The author argues that this is not the best
   solution; that the present land surface components of atmospheric models
   do not accurately model land phase hydrology and that, instead,
   atmospheric and oceanic models should be linked to continental-scale
   hydrological models to form a true model of the global hydrological

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Among the many concerns associated with global climate change, the
   potential effects on water resources are frequently cited as the most
   worrisome. In contrast, those who manage water resources do not rate
   climatic change among their top planning and operational concerns. The
   difference in these views can be associated with how water managers
   operate their systems and the types of stresses, and the operative time
   horizons, that affect the Nation's water resources infrastructure.
   Climate, or more precisely weather, is an important variable in the
   management of water resources at daily to monthly time scabs because
   water resources systems generally are operated on a daily basis. At
   decadal to centennial time scales, though, climate is much less
   important because (1) forecasts, particularly of regional precipitation,
   are extremely uncertain over such time periods, and (2) the magnitude of
   effects due to changes in climate on water resources is small relative
   to changes in other variables such as population, technology, economics,
   and environmental regulation. Thus, water management agencies find it
   difficult to justify changing design features or operating rules on the
   basis of simulated climatic change at the present time, especially given
   that reservoir-design criteria incorporate considerable buffering
   capacity for extreme meteorological and hydrological events.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy cow pastures and feeding areas around barns can be a significant
   source of nonpoint source pollutants to nearby streams. To help document
   the significance of these sources, nutrient export in streamflow from a
   56.7-ha, mostly agricultural, watershed located in southwestern North
   Carolina was monitored from August 1994 to January 1996. Total nitrogen
   and phosphorus export rates from the upper, predominantly pasture, part
   of the watershed were 18.0 and 1.4 kg/ha/yr, respectively, as measured
   by weekly grab sampling and 18.7 and 4.9 kg/ha/yr, respectively, as
   measured from storm event monitoring. Nitrogen and phosphorus export
   rates for the area between the monitoring sites, which included
   overgrazed cow holding and feeding areas and farm buildings, were 376
   and 86 kg/ha/yr, respectively for grab sampling and 351 and 160
   kg/ha/yr, respectively, for storm event monitoring. To estimate the
   amount of reduction from nonpoint source controls necessary to effect a
   significant reduction in pollutant loading, statistical analyses of the
   load data were conducted. The analyses for the five pollutants monitored
   showed that total suspended solids would require the greatest reduction
   (34.6 percent for weekly grab and 33.6 percent for storm) in loading
   after the implementation of controls for statistical significance.
   Nitrate plus nitrite was found to require the least reduction (12.6
   percent for weekly grab). Pollutant export rates computed from weekly
   grab samples and storm event samples used separately were compared to
   corresponding export rates computed from combining grab and storm event
   samples to assess the differences in monitoring schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The Attenuation Factor (AF), a screening model, was used to evaluate the
   relative degree of vulnerability of groundwater to pesticide
   contamination in Louisa County, Virginia. For evaluating the
   contamination potential of pesticides, three scenarios of pesticide
   leaching represented by high, moderate, and low cases of degradation and
   sorption in the soil were considered. Data layers were overlaid within a
   Geographic Information System (GIS) for spatial computation of AF for
   the actual and 2m groundwater depths. This spatial database was divided
   into five contamination potential categories namely high, medium, low,
   very low, and unlikely, based on the numerical Values of the AF for each
   cell (1/9 ha). The results for the three most mobile pesticides are
   presented in this paper. The performance of the AF model was evaluated
   by comparing its predicted results with the field data from an
   experimental watershed. The AF model was able to identify most of the
   frequently detected pesticides in the watershed. A sensitivity analysis
   was also performed. The results of this study provide information about
   the potential groundwater threat by pesticides to the citizens and
   decision-makers in the County and can be used for formulating an
   appropriate land use management plan to protect the groundwater quality.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water is a vital resource in the Yun-Lin area of Taiwan. A
   substantial amount is continuously extracted, creating adverse effects
   such as land subsidence and seawater intrusion. Minimizing these
   negative impacts depends on regulating the rate of groundwater
   withdrawal. An optimal yield must be determined to establish a sound
   water management policy. A wide range of safe yields for Yun-Lin have
   already been proposed based on constant hydrological and hydrogeological
   parameters. By extending the results of those investigations, this study
   presents a decision analysis model. The optimal yield concept is
   introduced as well. The proposed model incorporates a probability
   density function for rainfall recharge and a loss function, derived from
   fluctuations in the ground water table. Through decision analysis, the
   optimum yield is obtained by minimizing the expected value of the loss
   function. The optimal yield varies monthly because the probability
   density function is time dependent. Analysis results suggest that the
   cumulative optimum yield of ground water in the area is 1.26 x 10(8)
   m(3)/year. If the probability distribution function for rainfall
   recharge is modified as new precipitation data become available, the
   above suggested yield may require revision in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The contribution of agriculture to nitrate pollution of surface and
   ground water is a growing concern throughout the world. The objective of
   this article is to evaluate the current environmental policy governing
   nitrate contamination of ground water in the South Platte alluvial
   aquifer. In particular, the ``best management practice{''} approach is
   assessed in its relationship to optimal policy design. First, the
   current physical environmental problem and existing institutional
   arrangements are described. Second, legal and economic criteria are
   brought to bear on the question of appropriate policy design. Finally,
   the strengths and weaknesses of the existing policy are evaluated in
   this context and changes in policy that would increase effectiveness are
   recommended. Considerable justification is found for state-initiated
   control because victims of ground water pollution are dispersed and risk
   assessment is technically demanding. However, ex post elements of
   existing policy must be improved, perhaps through targeting and some
   devolution in monitoring and enforcement responsibilities.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Chapala, whose primary tributary is the Rio Lerma, is the largest
   freshwater lake in Mexico and for the past 95 years has maintained an
   average storage capacity close to 6,700 Mm(3). Starting in the early
   1970s, the Lerma-Chapala basin rapidly industrialized. In response to
   these upstream anthropogenic activities, the fisheries, aesthetics, and
   water quality of Lake Chapala have decreased as a consequence of the
   increasing chemical and biologic pollutants mainly from the Rio Lerma.
   Additionally the growth of Guadalajara has resulted in increasing
   potable water demands on the lake to satisfy a population currently
   greater than 4.5 million. During the 1980s, the outflow and water losses
   from the lake substantially exceeded the inflow and other water
   contributions. In this paper, the recent behavior of the hydrologic and
   bathymetric parameters of Lake Chapala are summarized and some important
   physical stresses on the system are identified. The focus of this work
   is the 1934-1989 period, and it is shown that starting around 1980 some
   of the main contributors to the lake water balance were severely
   perturbed and the lake reached its second lowest recorded level. The
   disturbances of the system are so severe that the entire regional
   ecosystem could be irreversibly affected in the near future.}},

Abstract = {{Proper management of animal manure is crucial to the viability of the
   U.S. animal industry and the quality of the environment. This paper
   analyzes the animal manure distribution in Michigan, identifies counties
   with high potential for land application of manure nutrients, and
   proposes a manure distribution prototype model for transporting surplus
   manure beyond individual farms for nutrient utilization. Tabulations of
   animal numbers by county and by 5-digit zip code are used to identify
   areas with greater potential for land application of manure nutrients.
   Distribution of the manure nutrients from surplus areas to the nutrient
   utilization areas is explored in a selected watershed by taking into
   account manure nutrient value, soil nutrient content, crop nutrient
   needs, topography and hydrography. The results indicate that by
   appropriate planning and collaboration transport of the excessive animal
   manure to suitable crop fields is an appealing alternative to utilize
   the manure nutrients while minimizing the adverse environmental impact.
   Further studies are needed to determine the necessary economic and
   institutional programs to implement the export of the manure at the
   regional level.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods for analyzing uncertainty are described and compared in
   terms of their applicability for designing vegetated waterways. The
   first approach uses First and Second Order Analysis and the second
   employs Fuzzy Logic. The two methods were used to evaluate the uncertain
   parameters in the Manning formula, which is used for calculating the
   velocity of water flow in vegetated channels. Results indicate that both
   approaches can provide the designer with an indication of reliability of
   the estimates, a way of selecting a design option which meets a
   specified probability of success, as well as a means of comparing the
   relative importance of uncertainty in various input parameters. Also,
   the two methods have the common advantage of being simple and requiring
   less data about the uncertain parameters compared to the more
   comprehensive stochastic approaches. Although the Fuzzy Logic approach
   appears to provide a more conservative design because of its slightly
   higher variance, compared with the First and Second Order Analysis, both
   methods have proven to be reliable and suitable to deal with
   uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Reservoirs are used to store water for public water supply, flood
   control, irrigation, recreation, hydropower, and wildlife habitat, but
   also often stare undesirable substances such as herbicides. The outflow
   from 76 reservoirs in the midwestern USA, was sampled four times in 1992
   and four times in 1993. At least one herbicide was detected in 82.6
   percent of all samples, and atrazine was detected in 82.1 percent of all
   samples. Herbicide properties; topography, land use, herbicide use, and
   soil type in the contributing drainage area; residence time of water in
   reservoirs; and timing of inflow, release, and rainfall all can affect
   the concentration of herbicides in reservoirs. A GIS was used to
   quantify characteristics of land use, agricultural chemical use,
   climatic conditions, topographic character, and soil type by reservoir
   drainage basins. Multiple linear and logistic regression equations were
   used to model mean herbicide concentrations in reservoir outflow as a
   function of these characteristics. Results demonstrate a strong
   association between mean herbicide concentrations in reservoir outflow
   and herbicide use rates within associated drainage basins. Results also
   demonstrate the importance of including soils and basin hydrologic
   characteristics in models used to estimate mean herbicide
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory investigation was conducted to determine the head losses at
   sewer pipe junctions (manholes) under surcharged conditions. A physical
   model of a manhole/pipeline system was constructed for head-loss
   measurements. Head-loss coefficients were determined for a variety of
   outlet-flow Reynolds numbers, surcharge levels, pipe sizes, flow
   configurations, and inlet-flow rates. Empirical formulas were also
   developed to estimate head-loss coefficients. The results indicate that
   head loss is insensitive to the amount of surcharge, but depends heavily
   on the now configuration, relative flow rate, and the change of pipe
   diameter within the pipelines.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of agricultural chemicals in runoff and recharge waters from
   snowmelt and soil thawing may represent a significant event in terms of
   annual contaminant loadings in temperate regions. Improved understanding
   of the melt dynamics of shallow snowpacks is necessary to fully assess
   the implications for water quality. The objective of this study was to
   measure the energy balance components of a corn (Zea mays L.) stubble
   field during the melting of its snowcover. Net radiation (Rn), soil (G),
   sensible (H), and latent (Q) heat fluxes were measured in a field near
   Ames, Iowa, during the winter of 1994-1995. Energy consumed by melting
   including change in energy storage of the snowpack was determined as the
   residual of the measured energy balance. There was continuous snowcover
   at the field site for 71 days (maximum depth = 222 mm) followed by an
   open period of II days before additional snowfall and a second melt
   period. The net radiation and snowmelt/energy storage change (S) terms
   dominated the energy balance during both measurement intervals. Peak
   daily sensible and latent heat fluxes were below 100 W m(-2) on all days
   except the last day of the second melt period. There was good agreement
   between predicted and measured values of H and a during the melting of
   an aged snow layer but poorer agreement during the melt of fresh snow.
   Both snowpacks melted rapidly and coincident changes in soil moisture
   storage were observed. Improved estimates of Q and H, especially for
   partially open surfaces, will require better characterization of the
   surface aerodynamic properties and spatially-representative surface
   temperature measurements.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional contaminant transport through a saturated soil is
   modeled using a 1.2-m radius geotechnical centrifuge. Small-scale
   physical modeling in the centrifuge is achieved in relatively short
   time, at stress distributions that are similar to those experienced in
   the prototype (actual site). A 0.05 mol/l of sodium chloride solution is
   used as a contaminant and conductivity cells measure the concentration
   of the contaminant throughout the porous medium. Scaling analysis for
   centrifuge modeling and l-g modeling are briefly discussed and it is
   concluded that centrifuge modeling simulates the effect of molecular
   diffusion; however, scaling of the effect of mechanical dispersion may
   be violated in the centrifuge if the interstitial fluid velocity is
   high. Centrifuge test results show good agreement with the predicted
   relationship between the coefficient of hydrodynamic dispersion and the
   Peclet number using column tests. Centrifuge modeling can be used as a
   complement of numerical modeling although the effect of mechanical
   dispersion may be overestimated in the former.}},

Abstract = {{Longitudinal stone toe is one of the most reliable and economically
   attractive approaches for stabilizing eroding banks in incised channels.
   However, aquatic habitat provided by stone toe is inferior to that
   provided by spur dikes. In order to test a design that combined features
   of stone toe and spurs, eleven stone spurs were placed perpendicular to
   170 m of existing stone toe in Goodwin Creek, Mississippi, and willow
   posts were planted in the sandbar on the opposite bank. Response was
   evaluated by monitoring fish and habitats in the treated reach and an
   adjacent comparison reach (willow post planting and standard toe without
   spurs) for four years. Furthermore, physical habitats within the treated
   reach were compared with seven reaches protected with standard toe on a
   single date three years after construction. Overall results indicated
   that spur addition resulted in modest increases in baseflow stony
   bankline, water width and pool habitat availability, but had only local
   effects an depth. These relatively small changes in physical habitat
   were exaggerated seasonally by beaver dams that appeared during periods
   of prolonged low flow in late Summer and Autumn. Physical changes were
   accompanied by shifts in fish species composition away from a
   run-dwelling assemblage dominated by large numbers of cyprinids and
   immature centrarchids toward an assemblage containing fewer and larger
   centrarchids. Biological responses were at least partially due to the
   effects of temporary beaver dams.}},

Abstract = {{Missing rainfall data from a time series or a spatial field of
   observations can present a serious obstacle to data analysis, modeling
   studies and operational forecasting in hydrology. Numerous schemes for
   replacing missing data have been proposed, ranging from simple weighted
   averages of data points that are nearby in time and space to complex
   statistically-based interpolation methods and function fitting schemes.
   This paper presents a technique for replacing missing spatial data using
   a backpropagation neural network applied to concurrent data from nearby
   gauges. Tests performed on a sample of gauges in the Middle Atlantic
   region of the United States show that this technique produces results
   that compare favorably to simple techniques such as arithmetic and
   distance-weighted averages of the values from nearby gauges, and also to
   linear optimization methods such as regression.}},

Abstract = {{Bottom sediment in Hillsdale Lake, Kansas, was analyzed to estimate the
   annual load of total phosphorus deposited in the lake from nonpoint
   sources. Topographic, bathymetric, and sediment-core data were used to
   estimate the total mass of phosphorus in the lake-bottom sediment.
   Available streamflow and water-quality data were used to compute the
   mean annual mass of phosphorus (dissolved plus suspended) exiting the
   lake. The mean annual load of phosphorus added to the lake from point
   sources was estimated from previous studies. A simple mass balance then
   was used to compute the mean annual load of phosphorus from nonpoint
   sources. The total mass of phosphorus in the lake-bottom sediment was
   estimated to be 924,000 kg, Kith a mean annual load of 62,000 kg. The
   mean annual mass of phosphorus exiting in the lake outflow was estimated
   to be about 8,000 kg. The mean annual loads of phosphorus added to the
   lake from point and nonpoint sources were estimated to be 5,000 and
   65,000 kg, respectively Thus, the contribution to the total mean annual
   phosphorus load in Hillsdale Lake is about 7 percent from point sources
   and about 93 percent from nonpoint sources.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) fertilizer rates for achieving optimum crop yields often
   vary within a field due to spatial variability in soil moisture and
   nitrogen content and other crop growth factors. When there is
   substantial within-field variability in these factors, uniform
   application of N (UAN) may not be economically efficient in terms of
   maximizing net return because N is likely to be over-applied in some
   areas and under-applied in other areas of the field. In addition,
   over-application can adversely affect water quality. A sample of fields
   in a Midwestern agricultural watershed is used to test for statistically
   significant differences in N application rates, crop yields, surface and
   ground water quality and net returns between UAN and variable
   application of N(VAN) for four cropping systems. Profitability and water
   quality benefits of VAN are sensitive to the distribution of soil types
   within a field. Water quality effects and profitability of UAN and VAN
   vary with cropping systems. VAN is not uniformly superior to UAN in
   terms of increasing net returns and improving water quality for the
   farming systems and watershed evaluated in this study.}},

Abstract = {{In the San Joaquin River Basin, California, a realtime water quality
   forecasting model was developed to help improve the management of saline
   agricultural and wetland drainage to meet water quality objectives.
   Predicted salt loads from the water quality forecasting model, SJRIODAY,
   were consistently within +/- 11 percent of actual, within +/- 14 percent
   for seven-day forecasts, and within +/- 26 percent for 14-day forecasts
   for the 16-month trial period. When the 48 days dominated by
   rainfall/runoff events were eliminated from the data set, the error bar
   decreased to +/- 9 percent for the model and +/- II percent and +/- 17
   percent for the seven-day and 14-day forecasts, respectively.
   Constraints on the use of the model for salinity management on the San
   Joaquin River include the number of entities that control or influence
   water quality and the lack of a centralized authority to direct their
   activities. The lack of real-time monitoring sensors for other primary
   constituents of concern, such as selenium and boron, limits the
   application of the model to salinity at the present time. A case study
   describes wetland drainage releases scheduled to coincide with high
   river flows and significant river assimilative capacity for salt loads.}},

Abstract = {{In order to obtain total short-wave albedos of snow and ice, both
   incident and reflected solar radiation were measured over a frozen lake
   surface using two different types of radiation measurement devices: a
   Kipp and Zonen thermopile pyranometer with a spectral sensitivity of 300
   to 2800 nm and a LI-COR photovoltaic pyranometer with a spectral
   sensitivity of 400 to 1100 mn. The spectral response of the LI-COR
   pyranometers limits its use as a short-wave radiation measurement
   device. Therefore, two equations were developed to adjust both the daily
   incident radiation data and the daily reflected radiation data measured
   by the LI-COR instrument to total short-wave radiation values, i.e., to
   the waveband of 300 to 2800 nm (visible to near-infrared spectrum). The
   LI-COR data were then adjusted, and a total short-wave adjusted albedo
   was calculated with a modeling efficiency of 0.97.}},

Abstract = {{Despite spending \$115 billion per year on environmental actions in the
   United States, we have only a limited ability to describe the
   effectiveness of these expenditures. Moreover, after decades of such
   investments, we cannot accurately describe status and trends in the
   nation's aquatic ecosystems or even those in specific regions. Why? This
   situation has arisen in part because we have excluded the fundamental
   principles of probability designs that are widely used in other fields
   and we have often ignored direct measures of biota, the subjects of
   greatest concern. To demonstrate the results of ignoring these powerful
   statistical and biological tools, we present four case studies. These
   studies compare estimates of aquatic resource status derived from using
   (1) a probability-based study design, often with biological measures of
   condition; and (2) a nonstatistical study design, often using chemical
   surrogates. In three of the four cases, the results derived from the
   nonstatistical perspective underestimate the degree of biological
   degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Sound water resource management requires comparison of benefits and
   costs. Many of the perceived benefits of water relate to providing
   instream flow for recreation and endangered fish. These uses have value
   but no prices to guide resource allocation. Techniques to estimate the
   dollar values of environmental benefits are presented and illustrated
   with several case studies. The results of the case studies show that
   emphasis on minimum instream now allocates far less than the
   economically optimum amount of water to instream uses. Studies in Idaho
   demonstrated that optimum flows that balance benefits and costs can be
   ten times greater than minimum flows. The economic benefits of
   preserving public trust resources outweighed the replacement cost of
   water and power by a factor of fifty in California. While it is
   important to incorporate public preferences in water resource
   management, these economic survey techniques provide water managers with
   information not just on preference but how much the public is willing to
   pay for as well. This facilitates comparison of the public costs and
   benefits of instream flows.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Department of Agriculture Curve Number (CN) method is one of
   the most common and widely used techniques for estimating surface runoff
   and has been incorporated into a number of popular hydrologic models.
   The CN method has traditionally been applied using compositing
   techniques in which the area weighted average of all curve numbers is
   calculated for a watershed or a small number of sub-watersheds. CN
   compositing was originally developed as a time saving procedure,
   reducing the number of runoff calculations required. However, with the
   proliferation of high speed computers and geographic information
   systems, it is now feasible to use distributed CNs when applying the CN
   method. Tb determine the effect of using composited versus distributed
   CNs on runoff estimates, two simulations of idealized watersheds were
   developed to compare runoff depths using composite and distributed CNs.
   The results of these simulations were compared to the results of similar
   analyses performed on an urbanizing watershed located in central Indiana
   and show that runoff depth estimates using distributed CNs are as much
   as 100 percent higher than when composited CNs are used. Underestimation
   of runoff due to CN compositing is a result of the curvilinear
   relationship between CN and runoff depth and is most severe for wide CN
   ranges, low CN values, and low precipitation depths. For larger design
   storms, however, the difference in runoff computed using composite and
   distributed CNs is minimal.}},

Abstract = {{During an autumn runoff event we sampled 48 streams with predominantly
   forested watersheds and igneous bedrock in the Oregon Coast Range. The
   streams had acid neutralizing capacities (ANC) > 90 mu eq/L and pH >
   6.4. Streamwater Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ concentrations were greater than KC
   concentrations. Anion concentrations generally followed the order of Cl-
   > NO3- > SO42-. Chloride and Na+ concentrations were highest in samples
   collated in streams near the Pacific Ocean and decreased markedly as
   distance from the coast increased. Sea salt exerted no discernible
   influence on stream water acid-base status during the sampling period.
   Nitrate concentrations in the study streams were remarkably variable,
   ranging from below detection to 172 mu eq/L. We hypothesize that forest
   vegetation is the primary control of spatial variability of the NO3-
   concentrations in Oregon Coast Range streams. We believe that symbiotic
   N fixation by red alder in pure or mixed stands is the primary source of
   N to forested watersheds in the Oregon Coast Range.}},

Abstract = {{A leafing or sacrifice lot is an area located outside of the free stall
   barn, where a daily herd spends several hours per day. Sacrifice lots
   are usually denuded of vegetation and have high concentrations of manure
   and urine that can contribute significant amounts of sediment,
   nutrients, and pathogens to nearby surface waters. In this study, stream
   water quality impacted by direct runoff from a sacrifice lot was
   monitored for a period of 20 months. Ambient stream water quality was
   monitored by grab sampling upstream and downstream of the sacrifice lot.
   During runoff events, stream water quality downstream of the sacrifice
   lot was monitored with an automatic sampler. Laboratory analyses were
   conducted for total suspended solids and nutrients (nitrogen and
   phosphorus compounds). A grass filter strip (GFS) was installed as a
   buffer downslope of the sacrifice lot 10 months into the study period.
   The impact of the buffer strip on the standardized pollutant
   concentrations and loads was evaluated using the non-parametric Wilcoxon
   test. The Wilcoxon test indicated that there was no significant
   difference (alpha = 0.05) in the standardized yield of sediment and
   dissolved pollutants before and after the GFS installation, except for
   phosphate-phosphorus and Altered total phosphorus concentrations, and
   sediment-bound total phosphorus and total kjeldahl nitrogen loads that
   decreased significantly. However, load decrease could have been
   partially caused by the smaller rainfall volumes after the GFS
   installation as compared to the existing condition.}},

Abstract = {{A set of simulation models consisting of a weather generator, and
   irrigation supply, soil moisture and crop growth components was used to
   evaluate the impacts of climate change on irrigated corn in locations
   near Albany, New York, Indianapolis, Indiana, and Oklahoma City,
   Oklahoma. The models evaluated the combined effects of modified water
   demand, supply and crop management (planting date, cultivar selection,
   irrigation). Simulations were duplicated for 100-year weather sequences
   based on current (1961-1988) weather statistics, and statistics modified
   by outputs from the GFDL GCM runs showing the effects from doubling of
   atmospheric CO2. Climate impacts differed greatly with location end
   management. Effects were most adverse in New York and least damaging in
   Indiana. At all sites, the beneficial effects of longer growing season
   and increased water supply were generally overcome by the detrimental
   impacts of increased evapotranspiration and reduced solar radiation
   during plant maturing stages. Adverse impacts of climate change can be
   substantially reduced by irrigation and appropriate selection of
   planting dates and cultivars.}},

Abstract = {{Wilson's Creek has an extensive history of toxicity from both point and
   nonpoint sources. Seven-day chronic daphnid (Ceriodaphnia dubia)
   bioassays identified one toxic site in the Wilson's Creek watershed.
   Procedures for the characterization phase of a Toxicity Identification
   Evaluation (TIE) were modified for chronic assessment and performed on
   four water samples from the toxic site. The characterization involved
   chemical/physical alterations of samples, combined with bioassays, to
   help in identification of the class(es) of toxicants; followed by
   chemical analyses. To help understand the additivity of mixtures, toxic
   units were derived. Successive samples contained concentrations of
   copper, cadmium, nickel and zinc that literature values describe as
   being chronically toxic to daphnids. Summed chronic toxic units for
   these values greatly exceeded ambient toxic units, and more than
   accounted for observed toxicity.
   Substantial fluctuations in water quality occurred over the five
   sampling periods of the characterization studies and a Test of Methods,
   June through August, 1991. This variability illustrates the difficulty
   in detecting and documenting nonpoint sources of pollution. Tests using
   living organisms, in conjunction with toxicity identification methods,
   on samples taken over time appear to be appropriate for detecting acute
   and chronic toxicity in areas impacted by intermittent point and
   nonpoint-source toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The study of wind generated waves is important because waves affect
   sediment resuspension in lakes. Measurements of wind velocity and wave
   elevation were made at three different stations in Lake Okeechobee.
   Significant wave heights were computed using a direct count from the
   recorded data, and verified by the root-mean-square value approach. The
   correlation between wind stress and significant wave height also was
   analyzed. The data revealed a strong correlation. In addition to field
   measurements, a Boussinesq-type wind-wave model was developed to
   simulate wind-generated, long-propagating waves. This model included the
   effects of wind stress and bottom viscous dissipation. Wave elevation
   and velocity field were evaluated numerically. A six-day simulation
   using 1996 wind data was conducted. Simulated significant wave heights
   were found to agree reasonably well with measured values. A predictive
   wind-wave model provides information about wind generated waves, which
   is used to compute bottom sheer stresses required for sediment
   resuspension studies.}},

   lumped data set (38,082 daily data pairs), equations were derived for
   daily, weekly, monthly, and annual mean temperatures. Standard
   deviations between all measured and predicted water temperatures were
   3.5 degrees C (daily), 2.6 degrees C (weekly), 1.9 degrees C (monthly),
   and 1.3 degrees C (annual). Separate analyses for each stream gaging
   station gave substantially lower standard deviations. Weather monitoring
   stations were, on average, 37.5 km from the stream. The measured water
   temperatures follow the annual air temperature cycle closely. No time
   lags were taken into account, and periods of ice cover were excluded
   from the analysis. If atmospheric CO2 doubles in the future, air
   temperatures in Minnesota are projected (CCC GCM) to rise by 4.3 degrees
   C in the warm season (April-October). This would translate into an
   average 4.1 degrees C stream temperature rise, provided that stream
   shading would remain unaltered.}},

Abstract = {{In 1983, current data were collected by the National Oceanic and
   Atmospheric Administration using mechanical current meters. During 1992
   through 1996, acoustic Doppler current profilers as well as mechanical
   current meters and tide gauges were used. These measurements not only
   document tides and tidal currents in San Diego Bay, but also provide
   independent data sets for model calibration and verification. A high
   resolution (100-m grid), depth-averaged, numerical hydrodynamic model
   has been implemented for San Diego Bay to describe essential tidal
   hydrodynamic processes in the bay. The model is calibrated using the
   1983 data set and verified using the more recent 1992-1996 data.
   Discrepancies between model predictions and field data in both model
   calibration and verification are on the order of the magnitude of
   uncertainties in the field data. The calibrated and verified numerical
   model has been used to quantify residence time and dilution and flushing
   of contaminant effluent into San Diego Bay. Furthermore, the numerical
   model has become an important research tool in ongoing hydrodynamic and
   water quality studies and in guiding future field data collection

Abstract = {{The decline of water quality in United States' lotic ecosystems (streams
   and rivers) has been linked to nonpoint source nutrient loading (U.S.
   EPA, 1990). Determining limiting nutrients in streams is difficult due
   to the variable nature of lotic ecosystems. We developed a quantitative
   passive diffusion periphyton nutrient enrichment system, called the
   Matlock Periphytometer, to measure the response of attached algae
   (periphyton) to nutrient enrichment. The system is simple to build and
   provides quantitative nutrient enrichment of a surface for periphytic
   growth. The periphyton grow on a glass fiber filter, which allows
   complete recovery of periphyton for chlorophyll a analysis. A
   14-kilodalton dialysis membrane was used as a biofilter to prevent
   bacterial and algal contamination of the nutrient solution. We
   determined the rates of diffusion of nitrogen and phosphorus ions across
   the Matlock Periphytometer's dialysis membrane and glass fiber filter
   over a 21-day period (42 and 22 mu g/cm(2)/hr, respectively). We used
   the Matlock Periphytometer to determine the limiting nutrient in a
   woodland stream. Six replicates each of a control, nitrogen, and
   phosphorus treatment were placed in the stream for 14 days. The results
   indicated that phosphorus was the limiting nutrient in the stream for
   the period and location sampled.}},

Abstract = {{The use of continuous time, distributed parameter hydrologic models like
   SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) has opened several opportunities
   to improve watershed modeling accuracy. However, it has also placed a
   heavy burden on users with respect to the amount of work involved in
   parameterizing the watershed in general and in adequately representing
   the spatial variability of the watershed in particular Recent
   developments in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have alleviated
   some of the difficulties associated with managing spatial data. However,
   the user must still choose among various parameterization approaches
   that are available within the model. This paper describes the important
   parameterization issues involved when modeling watershed hydrology for
   runoff prediction using SWAT with emphasis on how to improve model
   performance without resorting to tedious and arbitrary parameter by
   parameter calibration. Synthetic and actual watersheds in Indiana and
   Mississippi were used to illustrate the sensitivity of runoff prediction
   to spatial variability, watershed decomposition, and spatial and
   temporal adjustment of curve numbers and return flow contribution. SWAT
   was also used to predict stream runoff from actual watersheds in Indiana
   that have extensive subsurface drainage. The results of this study
   provide useful information for improving SWAT performance in terms of
   stream runoff prediction in a manner that is particularly useful for
   modeling ungaged watersheds wherein observed data for calibration is not
   available.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the use of a modified pebble count procedure
   (Bevenger and King, 1995) to detect cumulative watershed effects on
   headwater streams in the Routt National Forest in northcentral Colorado.
   The 42 sample reaches were stratified by disturbance (reference or
   disturbed) and geologic terrane (granitic or mixed
   sedimentary-volcanic). Water surface slope was a significant control on
   the number of fine particles in the reference reaches in both terranes,
   and the data from the disturbed reaches were adjusted accordingly. The
   disturbed reaches in the granitic terrane generally had a higher
   percentage of fine particles, and the adjusted number of fine particles
   was significantly correlated with the number of road crossings.
   Disturbed reaches in the sedimentary-volcanic (s-v) terrane generally
   did not have significantly more fine particles, nor were the adjusted
   numbers of fine particles significantly correlated with any management
   index. The lack of significant trends in the s-v streams is probably due
   to differences in weathering between the two rock types, and the
   location of the sample reach relative to sedimentary outcrops. Two other
   procedures were also used to assess cumulative watershed effects, with
   the Pfankuch channel stability rating yielding stronger and more
   consistent differences between the reference and the disturbed streams
   than the Tarzwell substrate ratio. We conclude that it may be difficult
   to define a standard reference condition, and that the number of mad
   crossings is more strongly correlated with the number of fine particles
   than equivalent clearcut area.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete block irrigation diversion systems have been proposed as
   alternatives to permanent dame of concrete or rock or temporary gravel
   berms. Permanent dams can cause stream channel instability, bank
   erosion, sediment pollution, ice flow blockage, and safety problems for
   recreational floating craft. Temporary berms can require substantial
   streambed disturbance and can promote sediment pollution, stream bank
   instability, and bank erosion. A design procedure was developed based on
   a model of the hydraulic performance of concrete block diversion
   systems. The procedure was used to model a site on the Gallatin River in
   Montana. The method relies on HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center
   River Analysis System) software combined with analytical techniques in
   an iterative scheme. The hydraulic performance of different diversion
   configurations (the existing heavy-rock diversion system, concrete
   blocks oriented parallel to flow, and concrete blocks oriented
   diagonally) was assessed using the model under a range of now rates. The
   minimum diversion dimensions (length, number, and size of blocks) that
   maintained block stability while diverting the requisite flow were
   determined for each model run. At the Gallatin River site, the block
   system oriented parallel to flow required less diversion material than
   the diagonal orientation. The recommended diversion length was 51.8 m
   (170 ft). Trapezoidal blocks with a top width of 20.3 cm (8 in), a
   height of 45.7 cm (18 in), and side slopes of 2 vertical to 1 horizontal
   were specified. This configuration minimizes the total block mass,
   diverts the required flow, and has a factor of safety of 2.0 against
   block displacement.}},

Abstract = {{Recent environmental concerns in floodplain management have stimulated
   research of the effect vegetation and debris have on now conveyance, and
   their function in a productive riparian ecosystem. Although the effect
   of stable, in-channel woody debris formations on flow resistance has
   been noted by several authors, studies concerning entrapment of detrital
   debris in vegetation are lacking. Logs, limbs, branches, leaves and
   other debris transported during flooding often become lodged against
   bridges, hydraulic structures, trees and vegetation, and other
   obstacles, particularly in and near the overbank areas. Hydraulic
   measurements obtained in a channel prior to and following the removal of
   woody debris indicated that the average Manning's n value was 39 percent
   greater when woody debris was present. An examination of the
   drag-velocity relation for vegetation indicated that an increase in the
   frontal area of debris and/or vegetation results in a nearly
   proportional increase in Manning's n. The influence of debris on flow
   resistance decreased as flow depth increased.}},

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates a method of using a hydrologic/water quality
   model to analyze alternative management practices and recommend best
   management practices (BMPs) to reduce nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) leaching
   losses. The study area for this research is Tipton, an agriculturally
   intensive area in southwest Oklahoma. We used Erosion Productivity
   Impact Calculator (EPIC), a field-scale hydrologic/water quality model,
   to analyze alternative agricultural management practices. The model was
   first validated using observed data from a cotton demonstration
   experiment conducted in the Tipton area. Following that, EPIC was used
   to simulate fertilizer response curves for cotton and wheat crops under
   irrigated and dryland conditions. From the fertilizer response functions
   (N-uptake and N-leaching), we established an optimum fertilizer
   application rate for each crop. Individual crop performances were then
   simulated at optimum fertilizer application rates and crop rotations for
   the Tipton area, which were selected based on three criteria: (a)
   minimum amount of NO3--N leached, (b) minimum concentration of NO3--N
   leached, and (c) maximum utilization of NO3--N. Further we illustrate
   that by considering residual N from alfalfa as a credit to the following
   crop and crediting NO3--N present in the irrigation water, it is
   possible to reduce further NO3--N loss without affecting crop yield.}},

Abstract = {{The unit hydrograph is a common tool in hydraulic design. Used
   correctly, it allows a design engineer to estimate a runoff hydrograph
   from a drainage basin given a rainfall event. The typical method for
   estimating a unit hydrograph for a gaged watershed is by deconvolution.
   However, distinct storms produce different unit hydrographs for a single
   watershed. Consequently, a design engineer usually develops a composite,
   or average, unit hydrograph based on several recorded storm events.
   Common methods for estimating this composite unit hydrograph include
   curve fitting, simple aggregation, and multistorm optimization
   techniques. This paper introduces a new method to perform aggregation of
   unit hydrographs. The method is an extension to the simple averaging
   technique, in which prior to averaging, the individual unit hydrograph
   time ordinates are normalized with respect to the average time to peak.
   The normalization method is compared to a simple averaging technique and
   two multistorm aggregation techniques at six rural watersheds in
   Alabama. The results indicate that on average the normalization method
   predicts runoff nearly as accurately as the multistorm techniques, and
   displays improvement for 60 percent of the storms tested when compared
   with the simple averaging technique.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores a range of forest hydrology issues and identifies my
   concepts of the field's most pressing research needs. I extend the topic
   to include teaching and education in the broader sense because current
   teaching is usually part of the researcher's portfolio and because
   education involves that of both the research scientist and a broader
   audience. I consider the primary research, education, and service roles
   of the forest hydrologist also within a range of domains or, as I prefer
   to identify them, scales: (1) the molecular or pore level; (2)
   hydrological process; (3) watershed function; (4) global considerations,
   and (5) the human dimension which, while not actually a scale itself,
   embraces, is important to, and is affected by the first four. All are
   topics screaming for attention by researchers, educators, and
   practitioners. I shall here focus on the middle three.}},

Abstract = {{While much is known about the hydrology of forested mountain catchments
   in the Pacific Northwest, important research questions remain. For
   example, the dynamics of storm precipitation amounts and the modeling of
   catchment outflows represent a continuing research need. Without an
   improved understanding of the spatial and temporal aspects of storm
   precipitation patterns, our ability to evaluate and improve
   physically-based hydrologic models is limited. From a practical
   perspective, tens of thousands of kilometers of access roads have been
   constructed across forested catchments of the Pacific Northwest. Yet,
   few forestry research programs focus on road drainage (e.g., ditches,
   culverts, fords). The few studies that address this issue indicate Mad
   drainage systems need to function effectively over a wide range of flow
   events and terrain conditions. In addition, historical forest practices
   associated with hillslopes and riparian systems have altered the
   character of many Pacific Northwest aquatic ecosystems. If restoration
   of these systems is to be effective, research efforts are needed to
   better understand the linkages between riparian forests, geomorphic
   processes, and hydrologic disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of changes in the landscape and climate over geological time
   are plain to see in the present hydrological regime. More recent
   anthropogenic changes may also have effects on our way of life. A
   prerequisite to predicting such effects is that we understand the
   interactions between climate, landscape and the hydrological regime. A
   semi-distributed hydrological model (SLURP) has been developed which can
   be used to investigate, in a simple way, the links between landscape,
   climate and hydrology for watersheds of various sizes. As well as using
   data from the observed climate network, the model has been used with
   data from atmospheric models to investigate possible changes in
   hydrology. A critical input to such a model is knowledge of the links
   between landscape and climate. While direct anthropogenic effects such
   as changes in forested area may presently be included, the indirect
   effects of climate on landscape and vice verse are not yet modeled well
   enough to be explicitly included. The development of models describing
   climate-landscape relationships such as regeneration, development and
   breakup, water and carbon fluxes at species, ecosystem and biome level
   is a necessary step in understanding and predicting the effects of
   changes in climate on landscape and on water resources. Forest is the
   predominant land cover in Canada covering 453 Mha and
   productivity/succession models for major forest types should be included
   in an integrated climate-landscape-water simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Forest hydrology should be a mature science with routine use of
   hydrological procedures to evaluate the effect of past, current and
   proposed harvesting practices on water resources. It is not. However,
   water users are pressuring forest managers to exercise their role in
   managing forested watersheds for water supply. Most forest managers are
   poorly equipped to carry out this role. Forestry schools need to ensure
   that their graduates, whether employed in forest management positions or
   as specialists in watershed management, understand that all forestry
   operations may affect instream or downstream water users. Specialists in
   forest hydrology should be fully aware of the following: (1) climate and
   watershed characteristics influence streamflow in separate ways; (2)
   forestry practices produce changes in water yield and quality, and that
   only these changes need to be evaluated to estimate their effects; (3)
   watershed storage is a critical factor in evaluating the effects of
   harvesting on streamflow; and (4) the effect of harvest on one watershed
   cannot be extrapolated to another without consideration of the processes
   affected. Research is needed to assist watershed managers in applying
   models to watersheds for which climate and streamflow data are
   insufficient. Research is also needed to incorporate climate, streamflow
   and other data for hydrological models into geographic information
   systems. Joint research projects are needed to develop physical
   relationships between stream channel characteristics of importance to
   fisheries biologists and streamflow characteristics affected by forest
   harvest.}},

Title = {{Selected challenges in runoff generation research in forests from the
   hillslope to headwater drainage basin scale}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{1998}},

Pages = {{765-785}},

Abstract = {{When faced with practical forest land management issues such as the
   impacts of logging or forest conversion to other land uses, planners
   ideally require a comprehensive understanding of within drainage basin
   hydrological processes to determine the most vulnerable areas to
   increased storm runoff and erosion. Land managers in particular need to
   know the source areas and magnitude of inputs to the storm hydrograph,
   in terms of water quantity, sediment and solute transport; and the
   routing of such hydrographs from headwater to larger drainage basins.
   The latter includes an overall assessment at various scales of the
   impacts of forest disturbance and conversion on the water balance.
   This paper will focus on runoff generation in terms of identifying the
   various pathways and source areas. Such aspects will be linked with the
   need for a more comprehensive effort towards the field testing of
   so-called `physically based' models of runoff generation. Some of the
   controversial issues arising from the difficulties in reconciling
   results from hydrochemical investigations with complementary hydrometric
   studies will be highlighted. Subsequently, attention will be given to
   topographic-wetness models, which have promising applications in
   forestland management. In addition, alternative simple models for
   application at the catchment scale will be assessed. The latter is in
   recognition that at smaller scales, heterogeneity both in time and space
   of soil hydraulic properties demand a greater number of parameters in
   modelling. Such considerations can even prove an obstacle in terms of
   the confident application of `physically bases models.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of peak flows, with specified return periods, are needed in
   practice for the design of works that affect streams in forested areas.
   In the province of British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, the new Forest
   Practices Code specifies the 100-year instantaneous peak flow (Q100) for
   the design of bridges and culverts for stream crossings under forest
   roads; and many practitioners are engaged in making such estimates. The
   state of the art is still quite primitive, very similar to the state of
   urban hydrology 30 years ago, when popular estimating techniques were
   used with little consideration given to their applicability. Urban
   hydrology then evolved on a much more scientific basis, such that within
   about a 10-year period, standard approaches to design were developed.
   Forest hydrology should follow the same pattern, at least as far as
   estimating design flows is concerned. Popular present day design
   procedures include the rational method and other empirical approaches
   based on rainfall data, as use of the standard flood frequency approach
   is limited by the paucity of relevant flow data. Estimating procedures
   based on peak streamflow measurements and statistics are likely to
   evolve, and these will include distinctions for rain, snowmelt, and rain
   on snow floods. Guidelines will also be developed for selecting and
   applying appropriate procedures for particular areas.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for understanding and, where necessary, managing
   sedimentation in humid mountain drainage basins increases with awareness
   of the conditions that lead to shallow landsliding, debris flows, and
   catastrophic sedimentation in stream channels. Progress in understanding
   has involved: improved recognition of source areas and the potential for
   downstream effects of slope failure; improved understanding of
   hydrological conditions required for failure; and a general theory of
   slope stability in shallow colluvium, including the role of plants,
   fires, timber harvest, and other disturbances. The theory acknowledges
   spatial variability in topographic and geotechnical terrain
   characteristics, the stochastic nature of climatic triggering events
   such as forest fires and rainstorms, and the integrating nature of
   channel networks in modulating the cumulative effects of transient
   processes within a basin. Anthropogenic fire regimes, road effects, and
   timber harvest can readily be included. Continued application and
   modification of the theory over an expanded geographical range require
   improvements in field data and their systematic storage in spatial
   databases. Improvements in digital topographic data for mountain basins,
   systematic network-wide surveys of channel conditions, and new
   technology for rapid documentation of soil depths in landslide source
   areas would enhance the prediction of mass failure, its consequences for
   channel habitat, and the basin-wide or regional distribution of
   hillslope and channel conditions. Computations of the probabilities of
   transient effects throughout basins could then form the basis of
   ecological risk analyses. Large-scale spatial data sets of a few
   critical variables are required before this next level of understanding
   can be developed and applied to sedimentation impacts on ecosystems and
   other resources.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrology is both an applied practical science and a pure geophysical
   science. The goal of hydrology, as a geophysical science, is to achieve
   theories capable of explaining with satisfactory accuracy the phenomena
   of interest. Through the rapidly accelerating power and versatility of
   digital computing technology, theory development and application are
   immensely facilitated via increasingly sophisticated predictive modeling
   schemes, which are now the principal operating tools both for applied
   management hydrology and for basic geophysical hydrology. While this
   approach treats phenomena as classes or generalizations, social and
   behavioral scientists have long argued that human beings base their
   actions on percepts, i.e., on the concrete specifics of their
   experience. Thus, the commonly held ideal of basing policy, decisions,
   and public actions on the best possible science encounters a conflict in
   belief systems. A possible resolution of this dilemma lies in the use of
   observational components, which in concept-centered science serve as
   data to test or calibrate models. These components also serve as a great
   repository of natural experience that is closely attuned to the
   perceptual reality that propels societal action. Landscapes and
   sediments provide indices of real processes, whose occurrence can be
   expected by continuity to extend to present and future activity More
   attention to research on such indices is warranted as a means of
   triggering perception-based action by responsible decision-makers.
   Grounded in reality, and tempered by their intrinsic fallibility, the
   scientifically powerful conceptual schemes (models) will then serve as
   guides to further action. The full societal benefit of hydrological
   science requires a balanced approach in which subdisciplines focused on
   environmental indices are afforded equal attention to those focused on
   conceptual idealization.}},

Abstract = {{Few hydrological models are applicable to pine flatwoods which are a
   mosaic of pine plantations and cypress swamps. Unique features of this
   system include ephemeral sheet flow, shallow dynamic ground water table,
   high rainfall and evapotranspiration, and high infiltration rates. A
   FLATWOODS model has been developed specifically for the cypress
   wetland-pine upland landscape by integrating a 2-D ground water model, a
   Variable-Source-Area (VAS)-based surface flow model, an
   evapotranspiration (ET) model, and an unsaturated water flow model. The
   FLATWOODS model utilizes a distributed approach by dividing the entire
   simulation domain into regular cells. It has the capability to
   continuously simulate the daily values of ground water table depth, ET,
   and soil moisture content distributions in a watershed. The model has
   been calibrated and validated with a 15-year runoff and a four-year
   ground water table data set from two different pine flatwoods research
   watersheds in northern Florida. This model may be used for predicting
   hydrologic impacts of different forest management practices in the
   coastal regions.}},

Abstract = {{The great temporal and spatial variability of pine flatwoods hydrology
   suggests traditional short-term field methods may not be effective in
   evaluating the hydrologic effects of forest management. The FLATWOODS
   model was developed, calibrated and validated specifically for the
   cypress wetland-pine upland landscape. The model was applied to two
   typical flatwoods sites in north central Florida. Three harvesting
   treatments (Wetland Harvesting, Wetland + Upland Harvesting, and
   Control) under three typical climatic conditions (dry, wet, and normal
   precipitation years) were simulated to study the potential first-year
   effects of common forest harvesting activities on flatwoods. Long-term
   (15 years) simulation was conducted to evaluate the hydrologic impacts
   at different stages of stand rotation. This simulation study concludes
   that forest harvesting has substantial effects on hydrology during dry
   periods and clear cutting of both wetlands and uplands has greater
   influence on the water regimes than partial harvesting. Compared to
   hilly regions, forest harvesting in the Florida coastal plains has less
   impact on water yield.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive use is made of on-site wastewater disposal systems of
   cesspools due to the absence of a sanitary sewerage system in Saudi
   urban areas. This system has caused the groundwater table to rise to a
   public nuisance level. A health risk has also evolved. There are several
   infrastructural, environmental, and social impacts from this, resulting
   in great financial losses. Examples are: surface water flooding, damage
   to foundations of buildings and asphalt street pavements, flooded
   basements and added construction costs required for excavation,
   dewatering, insulation materials, and special cements. Most of these
   costs are indirectly being paid by the private and public sectors. This
   study compares the estimated costs of damage and losses with the
   estimated costs of building, operating, and maintaining sanitary
   sewerage systems in the cesspool-served areas. The annual cost of the
   cesspool system, depending on the severity of the adverse impacts,
   ranges from 2.2 to 4.4 times the annual cost of the sanitary sewerage
   system. Remedies for these impacts are very expensive, and delays in the
   implementation of the sanitary sewerage facility will make the damage
   recovery more expensive, and in some cases, impossible. Thus, it is
   recommended that highest priority to be given to the sanitary sewerage
   systems in Saudi urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{An accounting procedure is developed which determines a flow regime that
   is capable of transporting an amount of bedload sediment necessary to
   ensure channel stability downstream. The method allows for sediment
   buildup in the channel within geomorphic threshold limits during low now
   periods. During periods of high runoff, enough water is bypassed to
   transport the stored sediment. The procedure utilizes only those flows
   of sufficient magnitude to maintain channel stability over the long run
   (25-50+ years). An example is presented which determines the volume of
   water and frequency of release for channel maintenance purposes
   downstream from a hypothetical water diversion project. Of some
   1,200,000 acre feet generated during a 59-year period, 86,500 acre feet
   was required for channel maintenance flows. Bypass flows were not
   required each year, but only during those years when average daily flow
   reached bankfull or greater. Such releases were made on 202 of the 411
   days when average flows either equalled or exceeded bankfull discharge.}},

Abstract = {{This study determines the most cost effective spatial pattern of farming
   systems for improving water quality and evaluates the economic value of
   riparian buffers in reducing agricultural nonpoint source pollution in a
   Midwestern agricultural watershed. Economic and water quality impacts of
   alternative farming systems are evaluated using the CARE and SWAT
   models, respectively. The water quality benefits of riparian buffers are
   estimated by combining experimental data and simulated water quality
   impacts of farming systems obtained using SWAT. The net economic value
   of riparian buffers in improving water quality is estimated by total
   watershed net return with riparian buffers minus total watershed net
   return without riparian buffers minus the opportunity cost of riparian
   buffers. Exclusive of maintenance cost, the net economic value of
   riparian buffers in reducing atrazine concentration from 45 to 24 ppb is
   \$612,117 and the savings in government cost is \$631,710. Results
   strongly support efforts that encourage farmers to develop or maintain
   riparian buffers adjacent to streams.}},

Abstract = {{A land management activity scheduling model that can perform a
   multi-period, simultaneous evaluation of aquatic habitat quality and
   commodity production goals was used to identify alternatives which would
   allow the improvement of aquatic habitat conditions over time, while
   producing wood products. The scheduling model has the ability to use
   stream sediment index levels, stream temperature index levels, and
   equivalent clearcut acres (ECA) levels as primary goals. A secondary
   goal imbedded in the model is the achievement of an even-flow of timber
   harvest volume, and a tertiary goal is the achievement of maximum
   efficiency (maximum net present value). The scheduling model utilizes a
   heuristic programming technique (Tabu search) to guide the selection of
   timber harvests and road standards. A 14,643 acre case study watershed
   in eastern Oregon is used to illustrate several policy scenarios.
   Activities considered include: clearcutting and partial cutting; cable,
   skyline, ground-based, and helicopter logging; road obliteration;
   requiring lower truck tire pressures on forest roads; and tree planting
   in riparian areas. The scheduling model produced land management plans
   which were spatially and temporally feasible over ten ten-year time
   periods. Stream temperature was shown to be dramatically reduced if tree
   planting is performed in all riparian areas, regardless of whether
   harvesting activities occurred, and including meadows and forested areas
   where shade density is low. Timber harvest volume levels decreased 31 to
   43 percent, and net present value levels decreased 36 to 46 percent,
   from an unconstrained case, when any of the following occurred: ECA was
   constrained to 15 percent, sediment index levels were required to
   decrease by 1 percent per decade, or temperature levels were constrained
   to ``no harvest{''} levels. The use of a heuristic programming technique
   is a departure from traditional techniques that are commonly used in
   management plan development. Yet the heuristic technique allows the
   inclusion of complex management goals, many of which may be prohibited
   when using more traditional mathematical programming techniques. In
   addition, decision variables which require spatial information,
   requiring them to take on integer or non-linear representations, can be
   accounted for without realizing the limitations of the traditional
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{In using non-linear optimization techniques for estimation of parameters
   in a distributed ground water model, the initial values of the
   parameters and prior information about them play important roles. In
   this paper, the genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with the
   truncated-Newton search technique to estimate groundwater parameters for
   a confined steady-state ground water model. Use of prior information
   about the parameters is shown to be important in estimating correct or
   near-correct values of parameters on a regional scale. The amount of
   prior information needed for an accurate solution is estimated by
   evaluation of the sensitivity of the performance function to the
   parameters. For the example presented here, it is experimentally
   demonstrated that only one piece of prior information of the least
   sensitive parameter is sufficient to arrive at the global or near-global
   optimum solution. For hydraulic head data with measurement errors, the
   error in the estimation of parameters increases as the standard
   deviation of the errors increases. Results from our experiments show
   that, in general, the accuracy of the estimated parameters depends on
   the level of noise in the hydraulic head data and the initial values
   used in the truncated-Newton search technique.}},

Abstract = {{A mesoscale meteorological model, a surface hydrology model, and a
   ground-water hydrology model are linked to simulate the hydrographic
   response of a large river basin to a single storm. Synoptic climatology
   is employed to choose a representative hydroclimatic event. The
   mesoscale meteorological model uses three nested domains to simulate
   relatively high-resolution precipitation over a sub-basin of the
   Susquehanna River Basin. The hydrology models simulate surface runoff
   and ground-water baseflow using both analyzed and simulated
   precipitation. The hydrologic abstractions are handled using both Curve
   Number and Green-Ampt routines. To support the linkage of the numerical
   models, special attention is given to data resampling and reprojection.
   The mesoscale meteorological model simulation captures the spatial and
   temporal structure of the storm event, while the hydrology models
   represent the timing of the event well. The Curve Number method
   generates a realistic hydrograph with both analyzed and simulated
   precipitation. In contrast, the hydrographic response generated by the
   Green-Ampt routine is inferior. Several interrelated factors contribute
   to these results, including: the nature of the precipitation event
   chosen for the experiment; the tendency of the mesoscale meteorological
   model to underpredict low intensity, widespread precipitation in this
   case; and the influence of the surface soil-texture characteristics on
   infiltration rates.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality impacts from two types of low water stream crossings
   (LWSC) were examined on the military training lands at Fort Riley,
   Kansas. The LWSC project was developed to enhance military training as
   well as improve the water quality of the streams. Water quality impacts
   of low water fords were quantified and compared to determine the effects
   of using rock to harden earthen fords. Both earthen and rock hardened
   low water fords were tested for the impact on stream turbidity, total
   solids, total dissolved solids, total suspended solids, and settleable
   solids. Results indicate hardening earthen fords with rock can
   significantly reduce water quality degradation caused by vehicle
   movement over the ford. Turbidity caused by vehicles crossing earthen
   and hardened fords was nearly sixteen times higher for earthen fords.
   Likewise, total solids, total dissolved solids, and total suspended
   solids concentrations were lower for hardened crossings. Total solids
   concentrations from earthen fords were nearly twelve times higher than
   concentrations from hardened fords. Hardening earthen fords not only
   provides the military with a more stable stream crossing for its
   soldiers to use, it decreases water quality degradation and improves
   local stream ecology. Recommendations for constructing rock hardened
   LWSC are given.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between wind velocity and the vertical light attenuation
   coefficient (K-0) were determined at two locations in a large, shallow
   lake (Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA). K-0 was significantly correlated
   with antecedent wind conditions, which explained as much as 90 percent
   of the daily variation in K-0.
   Sub-surface irradiance began to change within 60 to 90 minutes of the
   time when wind velocity exceeded or dropped below a threshold value.
   Maximum one hour changes in K-0 were > 50 percent, however, 20 to 30
   percent changes were more common. The magnitude of change in K-0 varied
   spatially based on differences in sediment type. K-0 never exceeded 2.8
   at a location where bottom sediments were dominated by a mixture of
   coarse sand and shells. In comparison, K-0 exceeded 9 during episodic
   wind events where the bottom sediment was comprised of fine grain mud.
   Underwater irradiance data can be used to determine threshold wind
   velocity and account for the influence sediment type has on K-0. Once a
   threshold velocity has been established, the frequency, rate, and
   duration of expected change in underwater irradiance can be evaluated.
   This is critical information for scientists who are studying algal
   productivity or other light-related phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrologic modeling study, using the Hydrologic Simulation Program -
   FORTRAN (HSPF), was conducted in two glaciated watersheds, Purdy Creek
   and Ariel Creek in northeastern Pennsylvania. Both watersheds have
   wetlands and poorly drained soils due to low hydraulic conductivity and
   presence of fragipans. The HSPF model was calibrated in the Purdy Creek
   watershed and verified in the Ariel Creek watershed for June 1992 to
   December 1993 period. In Purdy Creek, the total volume of observed
   streamflow during the entire simulation period was 13.36 x 10(6) m(3)
   and the simulated streamflow volume was 13.82 x 10(6) m(3) (5 percent
   difference). For the verification simulation in Ariel Creek, the
   difference between the total observed and simulated flow volumes was 17
   percent. Simulated peak flow discharges were within two hours of the
   observed for 30 of 46 peak flow events (discharge greater than 0.1
   m(3)/sec) in Purdy Creek and 27 of 53 events in Ariel Creek. For 22 of
   the 46 events in Purdy Creek and 24 of 53 in Ariel Creek, the
   differences between the observed and simulated peak discharge rates were
   less than 30 percent. These 22 events accounted for 63 percent of total
   volume of streamflow observed during the selected 46 peak flow events in
   Purdy Creek. In Ariel Creek, these 24 peak flow events accounted for 62
   percent of the total flow observed during all peak flow events.
   Differences in observed and simulated peak flow rates and volumes (on a
   percent basis) were greater during the snowmelt runoff events and summer
   periods than for other times.}},

Abstract = {{A continuous simulation approach is proposed for estimating water
   temperature exceedance probabilities using thermohydrodynamic modeling.
   The approach uses (1) a deterministic unsteady flow and heat transport
   model, (2) continuous hydrological and meteorological data for a long
   historical period, and (3) synthetic records of tributary water
   temperatures and other model inputs. Representative historical records
   of streamflow, air temperatures, and other hydrometeorological variables
   are obtained from nearby gages. Stochastic modeling methods are used to
   construct synthetic records for other model inputs, including inflow
   water temperatures. An application of this deterministic-stochastic
   approach is presented for a complex waterway in northeastern Illinois
   with heat discharges from several power plants and wastewater treatment
   plants. Statistical results from the continuous simulations are compared
   to results obtained from traditional event simulations. The application
   illustrates the information that engineers and biologists can obtain for
   (1) evaluating compliance with water temperature standards, and (2)
   assessing the effect of water temperatures on aquatic habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Forest land managers are concerned about the effects of logging on soil
   erosion, streamflow, and water quality and are promoting the use of Best
   Management Practices (BMPs) to control impacts. To compare the effects
   of BMP implementation on streamwater quality, two of three small
   watersheds in Kentucky were harvested in 1983 and 1984, one with BMPs,
   the other without BMPs. There was no effect of clearcutting on stream
   temperatures. Streamflow increased by 17.8 cm (123 percent) on the BMP
   watershed during the first 17 months after cutting and by 20.6 cm (138
   percent) on the Non-BMP watershed. Water yields remained significantly
   elevated compared to the uncut watershed 8 years after harvesting.
   Suspended sediment flux was 14 and 30 times higher on the BMP and
   Non-BMP Watersheds, respectively, than on the uncut watershed during
   treatment, and 4 and 6.5 times higher in the 17 months after treatment
   was complete. Clearcutting resulted in increased concentrations of
   nitrate, and other nutrients compared to the uncut watershed, and
   concentrations were highest on the non-BMP watershed. Recovery of biotic
   control over nutrient losses occurred within three years of
   clearcutting. The streamside buffer strip was effective in reducing the
   impact of clearcutting on water yield and sediment flux.}},

Abstract = {{This paper computes estimates of the demand for surface irrigation water
   directly from disaggregated profit functions for fields in the San
   Joaquin Valley of California. It finds that treating delivered surface
   water and pumped ground water as separate, imperfectly substitutable
   inputs to production matters a great deal. We find substantial ranges of
   inelastic demand for delivered water, and thresholds across which demand
   then becomes highly elastic. The results imply that moves toward freer
   water markets could lead to large quantities reallocated from
   agriculture to urban uses in the Western U.S., but would require large
   price increases and would induce extensive ground water mining and major
   changes in cropping patterns. While these results are dependent on our
   particular model and simplifying assumptions, evidence exists that they
   may be robust.}},

Abstract = {{Cedar Rapids obtains its municipal water supply from a shallow alluvial
   aquifer along the Cedar River in east-central Iowa. Water samples were
   collected and analyzed for selected isotopes and chlorofluorocarbons to
   characterize the ground-water flow system near the municipal well
   fields. Analyses of deuterium and oxygen-18 indicate that water in the
   alluvial aquifer and in the underlying carbonate bedrock aquifer was
   recharged from precipitation during modern climatic conditions. Analyses
   of tritium indicate modern, post-1952, water in the alluvial aquifer and
   older, pre-1952, water in the bedrock aquifer. Mixing of the modern and
   older waters occurs in areas where (1) the confining layer between the
   two aquifers is discontinuous, (2) the bedrock aquifer is fractured, or
   (3) pumping of supply wells induces the flow of water between aquifers.
   Analyses of chlorofluorocarbons were used to determine the date of
   recharge of water samples. Water in the bedrock aquifer likely was
   recharged prior to the 1950s. Water in the alluvial aquifer likely was
   recharged from the 1960s to 1990s. Biodegradation or sorption probably
   affected some of the ground water analyzed for chlorofluorocarbons.
   These processes reduce the concentrations of CFCs, which results in
   older than actual calculated dates of recharge.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic algorithms (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), two global search
   techniques, are coupled with MODFLOW, a commonly used groundwater flow
   simulation code, for optimal management of ground water resources under
   general conditions. The coupled simulation-optimization models allow for
   multiple management periods in which optimal pumping rates vary with
   time to reflect the changing flow conditions. The objective functions of
   the management models are of a very general nature, incorporating
   multiple cost terms such as the drilling cost, the installation cost,
   and the pumping cost. The models are first applied to two-dimensional
   maximum yield and minimum cost water supply problems with a single
   management period, and then to a multiple management period problem. The
   strengths and limitations of the GA and SA based models are evaluated by
   comparing the results with those obtained using linear programming,
   nonlinear programming, and differential dynamic programming. For the
   three example problems examined in this study, the GA and SA based
   models yield nearly identical or better solutions than the various
   programming methods. While SA tends to outperform GA in terms of the
   number of forward simulations needed, it uses more empirical control
   parameters which have significant impact on solution efficiency but are
   difficult to determine.}},

Abstract = {{The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, designed for use on
   rural ungaged basins and incorporating a GRASS GIS interface, was used
   to model the hydrologic response of the Ariel Creek watershed of
   northeastern Pennsylvania. Model evaluation of daily flow prior to
   calibration revealed a deviation of runoff volumes (D-v) of 68.3 percent
   and a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of -0.03. Model performance was
   affected by unusually large observed snowmelt events and the inability
   of the model to accurately simulate baseflow, which was influenced by
   the presence of fragipans. Seventy-five percent of the soils in the
   watershed contain fragipans. Model calibration yielded a D-v of 39.9
   percent and a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.04, when compared on a
   daily basis. Monthly comparisons yielded a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of
   0.14. Snowmelt events in the springs of 1993 and 1994, which were
   unusually severe, were not adequately simulated. Neglecting these severe
   events, which produced the largest and third largest measured flows for
   the period of record, a D-v of 4.1 percent and Nash-Sutcliffe
   coefficient of 0.20 were calculated on a daily comparison, while on a
   monthly basis the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was 0.55. These results
   suggest that the SWAT model is better suited to longer period
   simulations of hydrologic yields. Baseflow volumes were accurately
   simulated after calibration (D-v = -0.2 percent). Refinements made to
   the algorithms controlling subsurface hydrology and snowmelt, to better
   represent the presence of fragipans and snowmelt events, would likely
   improve model performance.}},

Abstract = {{Two infiltration models, called VVSIM (variable variance stochastic
   infiltration model) and EVVSIM (enhanced variable variance stochastic
   infiltration model), are developed in this study. A distributed
   parameter infiltration model can estimate the amount of infiltration
   over a field area by computing the infiltration over zones of the field
   area. Hydraulic conductivity is the most important parameter determining
   infiltration in simulations by infiltration models. The performance of
   an infiltration model depends on how well the model accommodates the
   complicated spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity. The two
   proposed models include the effects of spatial correlation of the
   conductivity distribution. Virtual conductivity fields are generated
   using the turning bands method. Monte Carlo simulations show that the
   proposed models give infiltration estimates more accurate than those
   obtained by the other models employed.}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{559-564}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A U.S. standard gage, a weighing-type recording gage, a standard gage
   fitted with an Alter windshield, and a pit gage were installed to
   evaluate the accuracy and wind effects on rainfall catch. The study was
   conducted at the Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest, about 20 km SW
   of Nacogdoches, Texas. A recording anemometer was also installed at a
   height corresponding to the standard gage orifice. Based on data from 67
   storms collected over a one-year period (July 1995-August 1996), all
   three conventional gages consistently caught less rainfall than the
   reference pit gage with an average percent deficiency greater than 10
   percent. However, the recording gage caught 2.7 percent less and the
   shielded gage caught 1 percent more than the standard gage - differences
   less than those reported elsewhere. The deficiencies were highly
   correlated with storm intensity, duration, or total rainfall. When the
   correction for wind effect on angle of raindrop inclination is included,
   the percent catch deficiency of the standard gage was reduced from 11
   percent to 6 percent. The remaining errors may be attributed to wind
   effects (streamline vs. turbulent flow), nonrandom errors, or other
   unknown sources.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic macroinvertebrate samples representing 151 tars were collected
   in August 1995 to examine the linkage between land use, water quality,
   and aquatic biointegrity in seven tributaries of the Blackfoot River
   watershed, Montana. The tributaries represent silvicultural (timber
   harvesting), agricultural (irrigated alfalfa and hay and livestock
   grazing), and wilderness land uses. A 2.4 km (1.5 mile) reach of a
   recently restored tributary also was sampled for comparison with the
   other six sites. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to
   characterize the seven subwater-sheds and estimate soil erosion, using
   the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation, and sediment delivery. The
   wilderness stream had the highest aquatic biointegrity. Two agricultural
   streams had the largest estimated soil erosion and sediment delivery
   rates, the greatest habitat impairment from nonpoint source pollution,
   and the most impoverished macroinvertebrate communities. The
   silvicultural subwatersheds had greater rates of estimated soil erosion
   and sediment delivery and lower aquatic biointegrity than the wilderness
   reference site but evinced better conditions than the agricultural
   sites. A multiple-use (forestry, grazing, and wildlife management)
   watershed and the restored site ranked between the silvicultural and
   agricultural sites. This spectrum of land use and aquatic biointegrity
   illustrates both the challenges and opportunities that define watershed
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The total phosphorous (TP) concentrations in the South Florida rainfall
   have been recorded in weekly intervals with a detection limit (D-L) Of
   3.5 mu g/L. As a large amount of the data is reported as below the D-L,
   appropriate statistical methods are needed for data analysis. Thus, an
   attempt was made to identify an appropriate method to estimate the mean
   and variance of the data. In particular a method to separate the
   statistics for the below D-L portion from the estimated population
   statistics is proposed. The estimated statistics of the censored data
   are compared with the statistics of the uncensored data available from
   the recent years' laboratory records. It was found that the one-step
   restricted maximum likelihood method is the most accurate for the wet TP
   data, and that the proposed method to combine the estimated statistics
   for TP < D-L portion and the sample statistics for TP > D-L portion
   improves estimates compared to the conventional maximum likelihood
   estimates.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the management practice
   effects on Ming-Hu and Ming-Tan reservoir watersheds during the past 15
   years. It is difficult to economically evaluate a watershed project
   consisting of a number of multisectoral and long term management
   practices and regulations. However, the reservoirs' hydropower
   operations and their associated benefits and costs are highlighted in
   this study. The estimated management practice value (net present value)
   of 351 million NT (New Taiwan) dollars and a benefit-cost ratio of 1.189
   are obtained for the Ming-Hu subwatershed. Because the Ming-Tan
   hydropower station only began commercial operation in 1992 the estimated
   management practice value is negative 103 million NT dollars (net
   present value) and the benefit-cost ratio is 0.653 in the Ming-Tan
   subwatershed. If the analysis period is contained to the year 2010, the
   benefit-cost ratio of Ming-Tan reservoir subwatershed becomes 1.103.
   Ming-Hu and Ming-Tan subwatersheds together share the benefit-cost ratio
   of 1.182 and the net present value of 1,589 million NT dollars. The
   results of the analyses indicate that the Taiwan Power Company, the
   watershed management agency, has implemented economically efficient
   watershed practices and regulations in Ming-Hu and Ming-Tan reservoir
   watersheds and the watershed management practices are worthwhile and
   should be sustained.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented to analyze time-drawdown data from one or more

   hydraulic conductivity, storage coefficient, and specific yield. The
   hydraulic parameter results are further analyzed for reliability and the
   possible ranges of the actual parameter values. After verification using
   a theoretical example, the method was used to analyze pumping test data
   from 22 observation wells in an unconfined alluvial aquifer near Grand
   Island, Nebraska. Results indicate that this method can be used to
   efficiently calculate the four hydraulic parameters in this type of
   aquifer. The method can also identify the impact of measurement errors
   on the parameter estimates, and provide ranges of the actual parameter
   values. The parameter values calculated using this method were compared
   to those determined using other theories. It is found that this method

Abstract = {{Recent work has found that a one-parameter Weibull model of wet day
   precipitation amount based on the Weibull distribution provides a better
   fit to historical daily precipitation data for eastern U.S. sites than
   other one-parameter models. The general two-parameter Weibull
   distribution was compared in this study to other widely used
   distributions for describing the distribution of daily precipitation
   event sizes at 99 sites from the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Surprisingly
   little performance was sacrificed by reducing the two-parameter Weibull
   to a single-parameter distribution. Advantages of the single-parameter
   model included requiring only the mean wet day precipitation amount for
   calibration, invertibility for simulation purposes, and ease of
   analytical manipulation. The fit of the single-parameter Weibull to the
   99 stations included in this study was significantly better than other
   single-parameter models tested, and performed as well as the widely
   endorsed, more cumbersome, two-parameter gamma model. Both the one-and
   two-parameter Weibull distributions are shown to have L-moments that are
   consistent with historical precipitation data, while the ratio of L-skew
   and L-variance in the gamma model is inconsistent with the historical
   record by this measure. In addition, it was found that the two-parameter
   gamma distribution was better fit using the method of moments estimators
   than maximum likelihood estimates. These findings suggested that the
   distribution in precipitation among sites in the Pacific Northwest with
   dramatically different settings are nearly identical if expressed in
   proportion to the mean site event size.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural and residential activities are key nonpoint sources of
   nitrogen pollution in urban-rural fringe areas. A GIS-based watershed
   approach was used to compare land use indicators (septic system and
   animal unit densities), to streamwater nitrate-N in the Salmon River

   an indicator of residential development while animal unit density was
   used as an indicator of the intensity of agricultural activity
   Nitrate-nitrogen (nitrate-N) concentrations as high as 7.1 mg.L(-)1 were
   found in the mid-portion of the watershed during the summer months, when
   streamflow is low and groundwater comprises a large proportion of water
   in the stream. The major aquifer supplying water to the midsection of
   the watershed is contaminated with nitrate-N. A comparison of the
   relationships between septic system and animal unit density and
   nitrate-N in the upstream to downstream direction provided evidence that
   both residential and agricultural activities contribute to elevated
   nitrate-N in the Salmon River mainstem. In contrast, only septic system

Abstract = {{Surface water quality data are routinely collected in river basins by
   state or federal agencies. The observed quality of river water generally
   reflects the overall quality of the ecosystem of the river basin.
   Advanced statistical methods are often needed to extract valuable
   information from the vast amount of data for developing management
   strategies. Among the measured water quality constituents, total
   phosphorus is most often the limiting nutrient in freshwater aquatic
   systems. Relatively low concentrations of phosphorus in surface waters
   may create eutrophication problems. Phosphorus is a non-conservative
   constituent. Its time series generally exhibits nonlinear behavior.
   Linear models are shown to be inadequate. This paper presents a
   nonlinear state-dependent model for the phosphorous data collected at
   DeSoto, Kansas. The nonlinear model gives significant reductions in
   error variance and forecasting error as compared to the best linear
   autoregressive model identified.}},

Abstract = {{Nonstorm water discharges to municipal separate storm sewer systems
   (MS4s) are notable for spatial and temporal variability in volume,
   pollutant type, pollutant concentration, and activity of origin. The
   objective of this paper was to determine whether current technical
   knowledge and existing U.S. policy support an improved regulatory
   approach. The proposed policy would use type of discharge as a
   regulatory basis, merging the concepts of allowability of de minimis
   discharges and type-based statewide consistent rules. Specific research
   objectives were to comprehensively identify discharge types,
   characterize their prevalence in California, analyze relevant local and
   regional regulatory guidelines, and systematically evaluate opinions of
   experts about potential water quality impacts. Results demonstrate
   nonstorm water discharges were widespread in at least one sector
   industrial facilities subject to a state permit; one discharge for every
   four facilities was reported in 1995, even though the permit explicitly
   prohibits such discharges. Clear consensus exists for minimal water
   quality concern for some discharge types when considering both municipal
   guidelines and experts' opinions. In particular, condensate from a wide
   range of equipment and discharges from fire fighting equipment testing
   were found to be of low concern. Discharge types with consensus high
   concern were largely limited to discharges prohibited under other
   regulations, such as wastewater and hazardous waste management controls.
   Some discharge types where no consensus was identified, such as
   landscape irrigation, nevertheless generated concern for water quality
   impacts and appear to be relatively widespread. Available information
   supports technical feasibility of the proposed policy because at least
   some discharge types show strong consensus for de minimis impacts among
   regulatory guidelines and opinions of technical experts.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory investigation on a scaled model of a landfill liner was
   conducted to provide data regarding the occurrence and extent of
   desiccation cracking of prototype liners. The crack intensity factor,
   CIF was introduced as a descriptor of the extent of surficial cracking.
   CIF is defined as the ratio of the surface crack area A(c), to the total
   surface area of the clay liner, At. A computer aided image analysis
   program was used to determine CIF values from scanned photographs of the
   desiccation process. The variation of the CIF was related to duration of
   drying and measured soil moisture suctions.
   The soil of this investigation experienced significant cracking, with
   crack widths approaching 10 mm in the first drying cycle and penetration
   through the entire 16 cm thickness. Crack propagation was limited to a
   very intense period of the desiccation process. Nearly 90 percent of the
   crack development occurred during a 19-hour time period, although the
   total duration of the desiccation cycle was approximately 170 hours. The
   soil moisture suction changed by only 2 bars during the period of rapid
   crack growth, although it changed by more than 40 bars during the period
   of reduced growth.}},

Abstract = {{The Great Flood of 1993 inundated more than 355,000 ha of Illinois
   cropland, creating great concern for the possible contamination of
   farmland by herbicides. The objective of this study was to assess the
   herbicide contamination of floodwaters and farmland due to the great
   flood of 1993. Floodwater samples were collected between August 5 and
   December 20, 1993, at the Horseshoe Lake State Game Reserve in Alexander
   County, Illinois, USA. Water and suspended sediment were tested
   separately for the more commonly used herbicides in Illinois and the
   midwestern USA: alachlor, atrazine, and cyanazine.
   These herbicides were detected in the floodwater samples, but
   concentrations were all below the health advisory concentration of 3 mu
   g/L established for drinking water by the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency. No herbicides were detected in the suspended
   sediment.
   After the recession of the flood, soil samples from flooded and
   non-flooded corn fields were collected for comparison. Soil samples
   taken from two out of three sampling locations had a 0.4 to 0.8 mu g/kg
   increase in atrazine at the flooded verses the non-flooded sites.
   Concentrations were 500 to 1,000 times lower than the recommended 1
   mg/kg rate at which this herbicides typically applied to soil.}},

Abstract = {{South Florida and the Everglades have been under intensive development
   since 1850 by Federal and State governments who encouraged and financed
   extensive drainage and hydraulic changes, primarily for agricultural
   settlement. Agricultural development of the sugar industry in the
   northern Everglades adjacent to Lake Okeechobee rapidly progressed only
   after the 1900s. Political and resource management conflicts have arisen
   because policies which once favored development are now being reversed
   by policies and regulation efforts to restore and conserve natural
   ecosystems. Currently, the environmental and ecological impacts of
   agricultural land use adjacent to natural wtlands of the Everglades are
   being assessed. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to outline the
   historical development of south Florida and the sugar industry, (2) to
   relate this history to political and management policy changes occurring
   as it pertains to ecosystem restoration and the multiuser competition
   for water/land resources, and (3) to propose how integrated resource

Abstract = {{Existing land use data were used to estimate nonpoint source phosphorus
   loads to Lake Champlain (Vermont/New York/Quebec) in a loading function
   model that combined P concentration coefficients with regional
   hydrologic data. The estimates were verified against monitored loading
   data, then used to assess the relative magnitudes of contributions from
   major land uses and regions of the Lake Champlain Basin. The Basin is
   comprised of 62 percent forest, 28 percent agricultural land, 3 percent
   urban land, and 7 percent water. The best-fit model estimated an annual
   total P load of 457 mt/year, which did not differ significantly from the
   458 metric tons/year measured for an average hydrologic year, and
   accurately predicted loads from major tributaries. Agriculture
   contributes 66 percent of the annual nonpoint source P load to Lake
   Champlain; urban and forest land contribute 18 percent and 16 percent,
   respectively. Because agricultural land contributes most nonpoint source
   P to Lake Champlain, load reduction effort must deal with agricultural
   sources. However, because the urban 3 percent of the basin contributes
   18 percent of the estimated load, high load reduction efficiencies might
   be achieved by addressing urban sources. This assessment clearly
   demonstrated the relationship between land use and P loads in the Lake
   Champlain Basin, a prerequisite for policy-makers to endorse a P
   management strategy requiring changes in land use and management.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes two methods that are introduced to improve the
   computational effort of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) as
   applicable to the operation of multiple urban water supply reservoir
   systems. The stochastic nature of streamflow is incorporated explicitly
   by considering it in the form of a multivariate probability
   distribution. The computationally efficient Gaussian Legendre quadrature
   method is employed to compute the conditional probabilities of
   streamflow, which accounts for the serial correlation of streamflow into
   each storage and the cross correlation between the streamflow into
   various storages. A realistic assumption of cross correlation of
   streamflow is introduced to eliminate the need to consider the
   streamflow combinations which are unlikely to occur in the SDP
   formulation. A ``corridor{''} approach is devised to eliminate the need
   to consider the infeasible and/or inferior storage volume combinations
   in the preceding stage in computing the objective function in the
   recursive relation. These methods are verified in terms of computational
   efficiency and accuracy by using a hypothetical example of three
   interconnected urban water supply reservoirs. Therefore, it can be
   concluded that these methods allow SDP to be more attractive for
   deriving optimal operating rules for multiple urban water supply
   reservoir systems.}},

Abstract = {{Physically-based models are extensively used to simulate the
   infiltration process under varied field conditions. Most models are
   based on the deterministic nature of input parameters related to the
   flow process (such as hydraulic conductivity). These models yield poor
   predictions of infiltration rates because they do not include the
   field-scale variations of flow parameters. The paper presents an
   approach for integrating the field-scale variability of hydraulic
   conductivity with an infiltration model to simulate infiltration under
   the rainfall conditions. A model describing the spatial structure of
   hydraulic conductivity has been developed using stochastic techniques.
   The stochastic structure of hydraulic conductivity was then incorporated
   in the Green-Ampt and Mein-Larson infiltration model. The model outputs
   on the instantaneous infiltration rates and cumulative infiltration were
   evaluated using the field infiltration data measured under simulated
   rainfall conditions. The results show that the combined model is capable
   of representing the instantaneous infiltration rates and cumulative
   infiltration of the study Boils. The model may, therefore, be used to
   simulate the rainfall infiltration process for spatially-variable soils
   under the field conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed studies of the surface hydrology of reclaimed surface-mined

   central Alberta yet this information is crucial for design of runoff
   conveyance and storage structures. A study was initiated in 1992 with
   principal objectives of quantifying surface runoff for both summer
   rainfall and spring snowmelt events and identifying the dominant flow
   processes occurring in two reclaimed watersheds. Snowmelt accounted for
   86 and 100\% of annual watershed runoff in 1993 and 1994, respectively.
   The highest instantaneous peak flow was recorded during a summer
   rainfall event with a return period of greater than 50 years.
   Infiltration-excess overland flow was identified as the dominant flow
   process occurring within the Sandy Subsoil Watershed, whereas saturation
   overland flow was the principal runoff process occurring within the West

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the investigation of the existence of chaotic
   behavior in the Singapore rainfall data. The procedure for the
   determination of the minimum number of variables essential and the
   number of variables sufficient to model the dynamics of the rainfall
   process was studied. An analysis of the rainfall behavior of different
   time periods was also conducted. The correlation dimension was used as a
   basis for discriminating stochastic and chaotic behaviors. Daily
   rainfall records for durations of 30, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 years
   from six stations were analyzed. The delay time for the phase-space
   reconstruction was computed using the autocorrelation function approach.
   The results provide positive evidence of the existence of chaotic
   behavior in the daily rainfall data. The minimum number of variables
   essential to model the dynamics of the rainfall process was identified
   to be 3 while the number of variables sufficient to model the dynamics
   of the rainfall process ranges from 11 to 18. The results also suggest
   that the attractor dimensions of rainfall data of longer time periods
   are higher than that of shorter time periods. The study suggests a
   minimum number of 1500 data points required for the computation of the
   correlation dimension of the rainfall data.}},

Abstract = {{Many water systems in small cities and rural areas throughout the United
   States are facing water quality and supply problems. These problems are
   typically not the result of an unexpected event, but are the result of
   growth trends or decreasing water quality experienced over several
   years. This analysis uses the contingent valuation and benefit transfer
   methods to evaluate the willingness to pay for a rural water system in
   northcentral Montana. Both of the procedures resulted in similar values,
   ranging from about \$4.05 to \$7.50 per household per month for urban
   residents and \$5.40 to \$11.50 per household per month for rural
   residents, which is equal to 11 percent to 23 percent of current average
   water costs. The willingness to pay estimates do not include
   non-household water users. This analysis shows that useful planning
   information can be obtained from relatively inexpensive contingent
   valuation mail survey data and the benefit transfer method as long as
   the limitations of the data are understood. The willingness to pay for
   ensuring good quality rural water supplies in the future is likely to be
   low compared to the costs of extensive diversion and treatment systems.
   Willingness to pay estimates provide decision makers with information
   that can be used to avoid building a large water supply system that
   water users do not want to connect to because of high costs.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Bivariate and trivariate distributions have been derived from the
   logistic model for the multivariate extreme value distribution.
   Marginals in the models are extreme value type I distributions for
   two-component mixture variables (mixed Gumbel distribution). This paper
   is a continuation of the previous works on multivariate distribution in
   hydrology. Interest is focused on the analysis of floods which are
   generated by different types of storms. The construction of their
   corresponding probability distributions and density functions are
   described. In order to obtain the parameters of such a bivariate or
   trivariate distribution, a generalized maximum likelihood estimation
   procedure is proposed to allow for the cases of samples with different
   lengths of record. A region in Northern Mexico with 42 gauging stations,
   grouped into two homogeneous regions, has been selected to apply the
   models. Results produced by the multivariate distributions have been
   compared with those obtained by the Normal, log-Normal-2, log-Normal-3,
   Gamma-2, Gamma-3, log-Pearson-3, Gumbel, TCEV and General Extreme Value
   distributions. Goodness of fit is measured by the criterion of standard
   error of fit. Results suggest that the proposed models are a suitable
   option to be considered when performing flood frequency analysis.}},
