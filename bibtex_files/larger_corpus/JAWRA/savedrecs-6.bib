Abstract = {{The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) is designed to compute daily stream
   discharge using satellite snow cover data for a basin divided into
   elevation zones. For the Towanda Creek basin, a Pennsylvania watershed
   with relatively little relief, analysis of snow cover images revealed
   that both elevation and land use affected snow accumulation and melt on
   the landscape. The distribution of slope and aspect on the watershed was
   also considered; however, these landscape features were not well
   correlated with the available snow cover data. SRM streamflow
   predictions for 1990, 1993 and 1994 snowmelt seasons for the Towanda
   Creek basin using a combination of elevation and land use zones yielded
   more precise streamflow estimates than the use of standard elevation
   zones alone. The use of multiple-parameter zones worked best in
   non-rain-on-snow conditions such as in 1990 and 1994 seasons where melt
   was primarily driven by differences in solar radiation. For seasons with
   major rain-on-snow events such as 1993, only modest improvements were
   shown since melt was dominated by rainfall energy inputs, condensation
   and sensible heat convection. Availability of GIS coverages containing
   satellite snow cover data and other landscape attributes should permit
   similar reformulation of multiple-parameter watershed zones and improved
   SRM streamflow predictions on other basins.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper four nonparametric tests for monotonic trend detection are
   compared with respect to their power and accuracy. The importance of
   comparing powers at equal empirical significance levels rather than
   nominal levels is stressed. Therefore, an appropriate graphical method
   is presented. The effect of the sampling frequency is also assessed
   using Monte Carlo simulations and a trajectory representation that
   visualizes the dynamics of the trade-off between the type I and type II
   errors. These methods are applied to compare four nonparametrical tests
   (seasonal Mann-Kendall, modified seasonal Mann-Kendall, covariance
   eigenvalue and covariance inversion) under several conditions. It is
   concluded with respect to the power that it is not worthwhile for the
   modified seasonal Mann-Kendall test applied to the AR(1) process
   considered in this paper to increase the sampling frequency from monthly
   to biweekly for detecting a monotonic trend of 5 percent, 10 percent, or
   15 percent of the process variance. Under these conditions the seasonal
   Mann-Kendall test is highly liberal, while the covariance inversion and
   the covariance eigenvalue test are conservative. This research is
   situated in the development of an efficient sampling design for the
   Flemish water quality monitoring network.}},

Abstract = {{The Watershed Nutrient Transport and Transformation (NTT-Watershed)
   model is a physically based, energy-driven, multiple land use,
   distributed model that is capable of simulating water and nutrient
   transport in a watershed. The topographic features and subsurface
   properties of the watershed are refined into uniform, homogeneous square
   grids. The vertical discretization includes vegetation, overland flow,
   soil water redistribution and groundwater zones. The chemical submodel
   simulates the nitrogen dynamics in terrestrial and aquatic systems.
   Three chemical state variables are considered (NO3-, NH4+, and Org-N).
   The NTT-Watershed model was used to simulate the fate and transport of
   nitrogen in the Muddy Brook watershed in Connecticut. The model was
   shown to be capable of capturing the hydrologic and portions of the
   nitrogen dynamics in the watershed. Watershed planners could use this
   model in developing strategies of best management practices that could
   result in maximizing the reductions of nitrogen export from a watershed.}},

Abstract = {{The geomorphic instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) may be one of the
   most successful methodologies for predicting flow characteristics in
   ungauged watersheds. However, one difficulty in applying the GIUH model
   is determination of travel time, and the other difficulty is the large
   amount of geomorphologic information required in the study watershed.
   Recently, using the kinematic-wave theory, Lee and Yen (1997) have
   analytically determined the travel times for overland and channel flows
   in watersheds. The limitation of using an empirical velocity equation to
   estimate the runoff travel time for a specified watershed is then
   relaxed. To simplify the time-consuming work involved in geomorphic
   parameter measurement on topographic maps, the GIUH model is linked with
   geographic information systems to obtain geomorphic parameters from
   digital elevation models. In this paper, a case study performed for peak
   flow analysis in an ungauged watershed is presented. The geomorphic
   characteristics of the study watershed were analyzed using a digital
   elevation model and were used to construct the runoff simulation model.
   The design storm was then applied to the geomorphic runoff simulation
   model to obtain the design hydrograph. The analytical procedures
   proposed in this study can provide a convenient way for hydrologists to
   estimate hydrograph characteristics based on limited hydrologic
   information.}},

Abstract = {{A field monitoring study of a riparian forest buffer zone was conducted
   to determine the impact of the riparian ecosystem on reducing the
   concentration of agricultural nonpoint source pollutants. Groundwater
   samples were collected from 20 sampling locations between May 1993 and
   December 1994, and analyzed for NO3-N, PO4, and NH4-N. Statistical
   analyses such as Friedman's test, cluster analysis, cross correlation
   analysis and Duncan's test were performed for the nutrient data. The
   study showed that the riparian buffer zone was effective in reducing
   nitrate concentrations originating from upland agricultural fields.
   Instream nitrate concentrations were 48 percent less than those measured
   in the agricultural field. Reductions in concentrations in sampling
   locations at the wetland edge ranged from 16 to 70 percent. The mean
   nitrate concentrations in forested hill slope were 45 percent less than
   concentrations in a well located in an upland agricultural field.
   Meanwhile, the concentrations of phosphate and ammonia did not follow
   any specific spatial trend and were generally higher during the summer
   season for most sampling locations.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate prediction of hydrodynamics is of great importance to modeling
   contaminant transport and water quality in a river. Flow conditions are
   needed in estimating potential exposure contamination levels and the
   recovery time for a no-action alternative in contaminated sediments
   remediation. Considering highly meandering characteristics of the
   Buffalo River, New York, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was
   selected to route upstream flows through the 8-km river section with
   limited existing information based on the model's fully predictive
   capability and process-oriented feature. The model was employed to
   simulate changes in water depth and flow velocity with space and time in
   response to variation in flow rate and/or water surface elevation at
   boundaries for given bottom morphometry and initial conditions. Flow
   conditions of the river reach where historical flow data are not
   available were computed. A rating-curve approach was developed to meet
   continuous and event contaminant modeling needs. Rating curves
   (depth-discharge and velocity-discharge relationships) were constructed
   at selected stations from the 3-D hydrodynamic simulations of individual
   flow events. The curves were obtained as steady solutions to an unsteady
   problem. The rating-curve approach serves to link flow information
   provided by the hydrodynamic model to a contaminant transport model.
   With the approach, the linking problem resulting from incompatible model
   dimensions and grid sizes can be solved. The curves will be used to
   simulate sediment movement and to predict contaminant fate and transport
   in the river.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic models have become an indispensable tool for studying
   processes and water management in watersheds. A physically-based,
   distributed-parameter model, Basin-Scale Hydrologic Model (BSHM), has
   been developed to simulate the hydrologic response of large drainage
   basins. The model formulation is based on equations describing water
   movement both on the surface and in the subsurface. The model
   incorporates detailed information on climate, digital elevation, and
   soil moisture budget, as well as surface-water and ground-water systems.
   This model has been applied to the Big Darby Creek Watershed, Ohio in a
   28-year simulation of rainfall-runoff processes. Unknown coefficients
   for controlling runoff, storativity, hydraulic conductivity, and
   streambed permeability are determined by a trial-and-error calibration.
   The performance of model calibration and predictive capability of the
   model was evaluated based on the correlation between simulated and
   observed daily stream discharges. Discrepancies between observed and
   simulated results exist because of limited precipitation data and
   simplifying assumptions related to soil, land use, and geology.}},

   study on the impacts of agricultural practices on the St. Esprit
   watershed was initiated in the fall of 1993. The water quality of this
   26 km(2) intensive agricultural watershed was studied over an 18 month
   period. Water samples taken at the outlet of the watershed were analyzed
   for nitrate, phosphate, suspended sediment, and atrazine. Water quality
   data were analyzed to establish seasonal trends in pollutant
   concentration and load in the watercourse. Spring snowmelt was
   identified as a significant period of pollutant material export. All
   pollutant materials displayed seasonal variability in the export
   process. Peak pollutant concentrations were associated with high flow
   events. Mean observed pollutant concentrations did not exceed drinking
   water quality standards.}},

Abstract = {{A multivariate approach was used to analyze hydrologic, geologic,
   geographic, and water-chemistry data from small order watersheds in the
   Quabbin Reservoir Basin in central Massachusetts. Eighty three small
   order watersheds were delineated and landscape attributes defining
   hydrologic, geologic, and geographic features of the watersheds were
   compiled from geographic information system data layers. Principal
   components analysis was used to evaluate 11 chemical constituents
   collected bi-weekly for 1 year at 15 surface-water stations in order to
   subdivide the basin into subbasins comprised of watersheds with similar
   water quality characteristics. Three principal components accounted for
   about 90 percent of the variance in water chemistry data. The principal
   components were defined as a biogeochemical variable related to wetland
   density, an acid-neutralization variable, and a road-salt variable
   related to density of primary roads. Three subbasins were identified.
   Analysis of variance and multiple comparisons of means were used to
   identify significant differences in stream water chemistry and landscape
   attributes among subbasins. All stream water constituents were
   significantly different among subbasins. Multiple regression techniques
   were used to relate stream water chemistry to landscape attributes.
   Important differences in landscape attributes were related to wetlands,
   slope, and soil type.}},

Abstract = {{Federal and state storm water pollutant control regulations for industry
   require facilities to identify themselves and to implement appropriate
   controls specifically developed for each facility by its operators.
   Compliance is not directly observable from publicly reported
   information, and is believed to be low. Compliance requirements are
   divided into three stages: determination and notification of duty to
   comply; preparation of public reports and site-specific planning
   documents; and implementation of pollution prevention activities.
   Aggregate data show about 25 percent to 35 percent of metal plating
   facilities in California, and about 35 percent to 40 percent of
   facilities in the Los Angeles region, have recognized the need for
   first-stage compliance; the number required but failing to do so is not
   known. For second-stage compliance, between 77 percent and 88 percent of
   facilities submitted required annual reports from 1993 to 1995, while
   on-site water quality monitoring reports were submitted by about 60
   percent of required facilities. Site investigations of ten Los Angeles
   area facilities showed variation in compliance with site-specific
   documentation and implementation requirements. Most facilities
   inadequately evaluated activities for potential storm water pollutants,
   and most prepared incomplete plans for storm water sampling and

   evaluating quantitative effects of facility actions, beyond the scope of
   this research, is recommended.}},

Title = {{Relationships between land uses and rainwater quality in a southcentral

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variability in rainfall concentrations of
   nutrients, major ions, and herbicides was monitored at 7 locations in or
   near the Conodoguinet Creek watershed in southcentral Pennsylvania from
   1991-1993. Results were used to (1) compare precipitation quality in
   forested, agricultural and urban areas, and (2) assess the practicality
   of using volunteer citizen monitoring in such a study.
   As indicated in previous studies, sulfate and nitrogen concentrations in
   precipitation were linked to sample pH. Concentrations of major ions in
   precipitation appeared to relate more to regional influences rather than
   local influences. However, concentrations of herbicides in precipitation
   may have been influenced by both regional and local use which caused
   compounds like atrazine, deethylatrazine, propazine, simazine,
   metolachlor, alachlor, ametryn, and prometon to be present in detectable
   concentrations in rainfall.
   Seasonality was evident in nitrogen, sulfate, pH, and herbicide data and
   was suggested in calcium, iron, manganese, magnesium, orthophosphate,
   and chloride data. Agricultural weed control activities were probably
   responsible for the seasonal pattern in pesticide data which peaked in
   May and June. Tropical storm Danielle may have caused the apparent
   seasonal patterns for the other nine parameters. This storm did not
   follow the typical west to east movement pattern and consequently
   produced rainfall of relative high quality.
   A variety of quality assurance checks indicated that trained volunteer
   citizen monitors were successful participants in this intensive and
   extensive scientific study, collecting good quality samples in a timely
   manner. Without this kind of volunteer help, it is extremely difficult
   to complete studies that require sampling in response to natural events
   such as rainfall.}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration (ET) from oasis and Gobi surfaces in the Heihe River
   region of China was estimated by Kotoda (1986) and Advection-Aridity
   (Brutsaert and Stricker, 1979) models. The ET estimates were compared
   with eddy-correlation ET estimates. The ET estimated by both models are
   in good agreement with ET obtained by means of eddy-correlation method
   for the oasis surface while underestimating ET as compared to the
   eddy-correlation method. For the Gobi surface, the models yielded
   obviously overestimates of evapotranspiration.
   In order to estimate evapotranspiration from arid surfaces, the Kotoda
   model was modified by introducing the surface moisture availability
   parameter sigma from Barton (1979). The modified Kotoda model yielded ET
   estimates that were very close to that from the eddy-correlation method
   for the Gobi surface. The modified Kotoda model was used to estimate
   evapotranspiration from the Heihe River watershed, an area with
   complicated topography and land use, and the results compared with those
   from a water balance method. A sensitivity analysis of the modified
   model was performed. The results show that the modified Kotoda model can
   reflect the relationship between the actual evapotranspiration and the
   main controlling factors on it for both wet and arid surfaces
   reasonably. From this study, it can be concluded that the modified
   Kotoda model is applicable fro the estimation of regional
   evapotranspiration from areas with complicated topography and land use.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water flow and supply at the Whiteshell Research Area (WRA) in
   southeastern Manitoba and the advective movement of contaminants from a
   hypothetical nuclear fuel waste disposal vault to the adjacent biosphere
   and a nearby ground water supply well are simulated using finite-element
   modeling and numerical particle-tracking technique. The hypothetical
   vault is located at a depth of 500 m, below the water table, in
   low-permeability plutonic rock of the Canadian Shield. The rock mass is
   intersected by high-permeability fracture zones (aquifers), which also
   act as conduits for vault contaminants to migrate to the ground surface.
   The ground water resource is, therefore, limited in quantity and quality
   and should be explored with care. A 30 m deep well, which pumps water at
   a rate of 120 m(3)/yr from a low-dipping fracture zone, LD1, reduces
   natural discharge from the system to augment natural recharge. At this
   pumping rate, a 100 m or 200 m deep well neither reduces discharge nor
   induces recharge into the system. Thus, at the WRA, a 30 m deep domestic
   water supply well best meets the water requirements of a one-person
   household at the rate of 120 m(3)/yr. The 100 m and 200 m wells best
   meet the requirements of a family of six and a family of six with light
   irrigation, respectively, without capturing contaminants' pathways from
   the vault to the ground surface. By virtue of the proximity of the 200 m
   well intake to the hypothetical vault, this well performs best as a
   purge well at pumping rates of 10,000 m(3)/yr and greater.
   Finite-element modeling is useful in evaluating the water supply
   potential of a fractured rock environment in which a nuclear waste
   disposal vault is proposed to be sited.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual, continuous time model called SWAT (Soil and Water
   Assessment Tool) was developed to assist water resource managers in
   assessing the impact of management on water supplies and nonpoint source
   pollution in watersheds and large river basins. The model is currently
   being utilized in several large area projects by EPA, NOAA, NRCS and
   others to estimate the off-site impacts of climate and management on
   water use, nonpoint source loadings, and pesticide contamination. Model
   development, operation, limitations, and assumptions are discussed and
   components of the model are described. In Part II, a GIS input/output
   interface is presented along with model validation on three basins
   within the Upper Trinity basin in Texas.}},

   model (described in Part I) to Richland and Chambers Creeks watershed

   maps using a raster-based GIS. Available weather data from 12 weather
   stations in and around the watershed and stream flow data from two USGS
   stream gauge station for the period 1965 to 1984 were used in the flow
   calibration and validation. Sediment calibration was carried out for the
   period 1988 through 1994 using the 1994 sediment survey data from the
   Richland-Chambers lake. Sediment validation was conducted on a
   subwatershed (Mill Creek watershed) situated on Chambers Creek of the RC
   watershed. The model was evaluated by well established statistical and
   visual methods and was found to explain at least 84 percent and 65
   percent of the variability in the observed stream flow data for the
   calibration and validation periods, respectively. In addition, the model
   predicted the accumulated sediment load within 2 percent and 9 percent
   from the observed data for the RC watershed and Mill Creek watershed,

Abstract = {{Observed April 1 snowpack accumulations within and near the Gunnison
   River basin in southwestern Colorado are compared with simulations from
   the Rhea-orographic-precipitation model to determine if the model
   simulates reliable magnitudes and temporal and spatial variability in
   winter precipitation for the basin. Twenty simulations of the Rhea model
   were performed using `optimal' parameter sets determined for
   10-kilometer (km) grids (10-km by 10-km grid cells) through stochastic
   calibration. Comparisons of Rhea-model simulations of winter
   precipitation with April 1 snowpack accumulations at 32 snowcourse
   stations were performed for the years 1972-1990. For most stations and
   most years the Rhea model reliably simulates the temporal and spatial
   veriability in April 1 snowpack accumulations. However, in general, the
   Rhea-model underestimates April 1 snowpack accumulations in the Gunnison
   River basin area, and the underestimation is greatest for locations that
   receive the largest amount of snow. A significant portion of the error
   in Rhea-model simulations is due to the calibration of the Rhea model
   using gauge-catch precipitation measurements which can be as much as 50
   percent below actual snowfall accumulations. Additional error in the
   Rhea-model simulations is a result of the comparison of gridded
   precipitation values to observed values measured at points.}},

Abstract = {{The Palmer Drought Index (PDI) is used as an indicator of drought
   severity, and a particular index value is often the signal to begin or
   discontinue elements of a drought contingency plan. The Standardized
   Precipitation Index (SPI) was recently developed to quantify a
   precipitation deficit for different time scales. It was designed to be
   an indicator of drought that recognizes the importance of time scales in
   the analysis of water availability and water use.
   This study compares historical time series of the PDI with time series
   of the corresponding SPI through spectral analysis. Results show that
   the spectral characteristics of the PDI vary from site to site
   throughout the U.S., while those of the SPI do not vary from site to
   site. They also show that the PDI has a complex structure with an
   exceptionally long memory, while the SPI is an easily interpreted,
   simple moving average process.}},

Abstract = {{A method for water resources protection based on spatial variability of
   vulnerability is proposed. The vulnerability of a water resource is
   defined as the risk that the resource will become contaminated if a
   pollutant is placed on the surface at one point as compared to another.
   A spatial modelling method is defined in this paper to estimate a travel
   time between any point of a catchment and a resource (river or well).
   This method is based on spatial analysis tools integrated in
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The method is illustrated by an
   application to an area of Massif Central (France) where three different
   types of flow appear: surface flow, shallow subsurface flow, and
   permanent ground water flow (baseflow). The proposed method gives
   results similar to classical methods of estimation of travel time. The
   contribution of GIS is to improve the mapping of vulnerability by taking
   the spatial variability of physical phenomena into account.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic phosphorus loading, mainly from the Everglades
   Agricultural Area (EAA), is believed to be the primary cause of
   eutrophication in the Everglades. The state of Florida has adopted a
   plan for addressing Everglades eutrophication problems by reducing
   anthropogenic phosphorus loads through the implementation of Best
   Management Practices (BMPs) in agricultural watersheds and the
   construction of stormwater treatment areas (STAs). Optimizing the
   effectiveness of these STAs for reducing phosphorus concentrations from
   agricultural runoff is a critical component of the District's
   comprehensive Everglades protection effort. Therefore, the objective of
   this study was to develop a simple tool that can be used to estimate
   STAs' performance and evaluate management alternatives considered in the
   Everglades restoration efforts. The model was tested at two south
   Florida wetland sites and then was used to simulate several management
   alternatives and predict ecosystem responses to reduced external
   phosphorus (P) loadings. Good agreement between model predictions at the
   two wetland sites and actual observations indicated that the model can
   be used as a management tool to predict wetlands' response to reductions
   in external phosphorus load and long-term P levels in aquatic
   ecosystems. Model results showed that lowering P content of the
   Everglades Protection Area (EPA) depends on reducing P loads originating
   from EAA discharges, not from rainfall. Assuming no action is taken
   (e.g., no BMPs or STAs implemented), the steady state model predicted
   that the average concentration within the modeled area of the marsh
   would reach 20 mu g L(-1) within five years. With an 85 percent
   reduction in P loading, the steady-state model predicted that Water
   Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A)P concentration will equilibrate at
   approximately 10 mu g L(-1), while elimination of all loadings is
   projected to further reduce marsh P to values less than 10 mu g L(-1).}},

   These explain 65 and 74 percent of the observed variances in the mean

   made for several locations previously unused in the study and they are
   used to estimate the return periods of various flows from the lognormal

   suggests that only one of the five test stations can be considered

   using the 5-km PRISM estimates would improve map accuracy. Visual
   inspection showed good general agreement among our runoff maps, as well

   quantitative uncertainty analysis comparing runoff interpolated from our
   maps with gage data that had been withheld showed slightly smaller
   actual and percentage interpolation errors for the 5-km PRISM-based
   maps. Our analyses suggest a modest region-wide improvement in runoff

Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{167-177}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Unit hydrograph ordinates are often estimated by deconvoluting excess
   rainfall pulses and corresponding direct runoff. The resulting ordinates
   are given at discrete times spaced evenly at intervals equal to the
   duration of the rainfall pulse. If the new duration is not a multiple of
   the parent duration, hydrograph interpolation is required. Linear
   interpolation, piece-wise nonlinear interpolation and graphical
   smoothing have been used. These interpolation schemes are expedient but
   they lack theoretical basis and can lead to undesirable results.
   Interpolation can be avoided if the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH)
   for the watershed is known. Here two issues connected with the classic
   Nash IUH are examined: (1) how should the Nash parameters be estimated?
   and (2) under what conditions is the resulting hydrograph able to
   reasonably represent watershed response? In the first case, nonlinear
   constrained optimization provides better estimates of the IUH parameters
   than does the method of moments. In the second case, the Nash IUH gives
   good results on watersheds with mild shape unit hydrographs, but
   performs poorly on watersheds having sharply peaked unit hydrographs.
   Overall, in comparison to empirical interpolation alternatives, the Nash
   IUH offers a theoretically sound and practical approach to estimate unit
   hydrographs for a wide variety of watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing specialization separates animal production from cropland,
   complicating manure management. To assist policy targeting efforts, we
   highlight areas where on-farm use of manure may be problematic. Matching
   confined animal production with land, on the farm-rather than at the
   county-level, gives our analysis an advantage over previous studies in
   avoiding aggregation problems. With manure-based water quality problems,
   data aggregated to the county level may fail to convey the heterogeneity
   of animal production across regions and animal types. Aggregation bias
   blurs the distinction between areas with specialized animal production
   and those that merely have numerous animals. We estimate bias from using
   county aggregates, show its distribution spatially and by animal sector,
   and link it to concentration. Ongoing vertical integration in
   agriculture likely alters in-county variability in facility scale and
   scope, and may influence decisions about which data we should gather and
   use.}},

Abstract = {{Optimization formulations for hydraulic control that take the form of
   linear programs possess a corresponding dual Linear program. The
   economic and physical interpretations of the dual linear program are
   examined for formulations in which hydraulic head in groundwater systems
   is constrained. In each case it is shown that the dual linear program
   has a physically meaningful interpretation. For a hydraulic gradient
   control formulation used for remedial analysis it is shown that the dual
   variable can be interpreted as the remedial benefit due to each gradient
   control constraint. The dual linear program maximizes the remedial
   benefit. The value of the dual variable can be used to compute such
   useful properties as the total remedial benefit of pumping at a specific
   location. For a formulation that optimizes aquifer yield while
   constraining drawdown the dual variable can be used to measure the total
   cost of drawdown capacity consumption per unit of pumping at a specific
   location. The dual program minimizes the cost of drawdown capacity
   consumption. By examining the meaning of the dual linear program an
   alternate statement of the problem under study is revealed. Quantities
   arising from the dual program add to the value of the optimization
   approach. Significant new information can be derived from existing
   linear optimization formulations with minimal additional computational
   effort.}},

Abstract = {{A regional assessment of water quality in small streams was conducted
   within four areas of distinct physiography and lithology in the upper
   Potomac River Basin. The Potomac River is a major tributary to the
   Chesapeake Bay, and this study provides new insight on the relationships
   between nutrient concentrations in small streams and watershed
   characteristics within this river basin. Nutrient concentrations were
   compared to land-use data including categories for agriculture (cropland
   and pasture), urban areas, and forests. Among agricultural areas,
   streams draining areas of intense row cropping typically contained
   higher nitrate concentrations than did those draining pastures. Streams
   draining forested areas typically had the lowest nutrient
   concentrations. Streams in areas underlain by carbonate bedrock were
   more likely to contain elevated concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and
   potassium than did streams in areas underlain by fractured siliciclastic
   or crystalline rocks, and we suggest that this is a physical phenomenon
   related to high hydraulic conductivities in carbonate ground-water
   systems. The median nitrate concentrations were highest in the Great
   Valley portion of the Valley and Ridge physiographic province,
   particularly in watersheds that have both carbonate bedrock and
   intensive row cropping. Values of nitrate in these streams ranged up to
   8.99 mg/L as nitrogen. The soluble phosphorus concentrations during
   baseflow were generally low in all subunits, even in some settings with
   potential for high phosphorus inputs such as urban areas with municipal
   point sources or agricultural areas. The mobility of phosphorus in these
   environments may be hindered by adsorption and geochemical reactions.}},

Abstract = {{A first-order uncertainty technique is developed to quantify the
   relationship between field data collection and a modeling exercise
   involving both calibration and subsequent verification. A simple
   statistic (LTOTAL) is used to quantify the total likelihood
   (probability) of successfully calibrating and verifying the model.
   Results from the first-order technique are compared with those from a
   traditional Monte Carlo simulation approach using a simple
   Streeter-Phelps dissolved oxygen model. The largest single difference is
   caused by the filtering or removal of unrealistic outcomes within the
   Monte Carlo framework. The amount of bias inherent in the first-order
   approach is also a function of the magnitude of input variability and
   sampling location. The minimum bias of the first-order technique is
   approximately 20 percent for a case involving relatively large
   uncertainties. However the bias is well behaved (consistent) so as to
   allow for correct decision making regarding the relative efficacy of
   various sampling strategies. The utility of the first-order technique is
   demonstrated by linking data collection costs with modeling performance.
   For a simple and inexpensive project, a wise and informed selection
   resulted in an LTOTAL value of 86 percent, while an uninformed selection
   could result in an LTOTAL value of only 55 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow changes resulting from clearcut harvest of lodgepole pine
   (Pinus contorta) on a 2145 hectare drainage basin are evaluated by the
   paired watershed technique. Thirty years of continuous daily streamflow
   records were used in the analysis, including 10 pre-harvest and 20
   post-harvest years of data. Regression analysis was used to estimate the
   effects of timber harvest on annual water yield and annual peak
   discharge. Removal of 14 million hoard feet of lodgepole pine (Pinus
   contorta) from about 526 hectares (25 percent of the basin) produced an
   average of 14.7 cm additional water yield per year, or an increase of 52
   percent. Mean annual daily maximum discharge also increased bq 1.6 cubic
   meters per second or 66 percent. Increases occurred primarily during the
   period of May through August with little or no change in wintertime
   streamflows. Results suggest that clearcutting conifers in relatively
   large watersheds (> 2000 ha) may produce significant increases in water
   yield and flooding. Implications of altered streamflow regimes are
   important for assessing the future ecological integrity of stream
   ecosystems subject to large-scale timber harvest and other disturbances
   that remove a substantial proportion. of the forest cover.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1197-1207}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Stream channel stability is affected by peak flows rather than average
   annual water yield. Timber harvesting and other land management
   activities that contribute to soil compaction, vegetation removal, or
   increased drainage density can increase peak discharges and decrease the
   recurrence interval of bankfull discharges. Increased peak discharges
   can cause more frequent movement of large streambed materials, leading
   to more rapid stream channel change or instability. This study proposes
   a relationship between increased discharge and channel stability, and
   presents a methodology that can be used to evaluate stream channel
   stability thresholds on a stream reach basis. Detailed surveys of the
   channel cross section, water surface slope, streambed particle size
   distribution, and field identification of bankfull stage are used to
   estimate existing bankfull flow conditions. These site specific stream
   channel characteristics are used in bed load movement formulae to
   predict critical flow conditions for entrainment of coarse bed material
   (D-84 size fraction). The ``relative bed stability{''} index, defined as
   the ratio of critical flow condition to the existing condition at
   bankfull discharge, can predict whether increased peak discharges will
   exceed stream channel thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies of ground water pollution in general and nitrate
   contamination in particular have often relied on a one-time
   investigation, tracking of individual wells, or aggregate summaries.
   Studies of changes in spatial distribution of contaminants over time are
   lacking. This paper presents a method to compare spatial distributions
   for possible changes over time. The large-scale spatial distribution at
   a given time can be considered as a surface over the area (a trend
   surface). The changes in spatial distribution from period to period can
   be revealed by the differences in the shape and/or height of surfaces.
   If such a surface is described by a polynomial function, changes in
   surfaces can be detected by testing statistically for differences in
   their corresponding polynomial functions. This method was applied to
   nitrate concentration in a population of wells in an agricultural
   drainage basin in Iowa, sampled in three different years. For the period
   of 1981-1992, the large-scale spatial distribution of nitrate
   concentration did not show significant change in the shape of spatial
   surfaces; while the magnitude of nitrate concentration in the basin, or
   height of the computed surfaces showed significant fluctuations. The
   change in magnitude of nitrate concentration is closely related to
   climatic variations, especially in precipitation. The lack of change in
   the shape of spatial surfaces means that either the influence of land
   use/nitrogen management was overshadowed by climatic influence, or the
   changes in land use/management occurred in a random fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Most research on the temporal aspect of nitrate pollution in water
   resources has focused on surface water. Comprehensive studies on the
   dynamics of nitrate in ground water are lacking, especially on a
   drainage basin scale and for relatively long periods of time. In this
   study, structural equation modeling is applied in investigating the
   influences of climate, hydrology, and nitrogen management in
   agricultural production on nitrate concentration in the Big Spring
   Basin, Iowa, over a 10-year period. The study shows that for given
   hydrogeological settings, nitrogen management practices and climate are
   the two most important factors that affect nitrate dynamics. The
   long-term trend of nitrate is closely related to the nitrogen input
   primarily determined by management practices. The potential effects of
   nitrogen management, however, are contingent on the variations of
   climate. The improvements in water quality (reduced nitrate
   concentration and loads) in relation to improved nitrogen management are
   often overshadowed by the impact of climate, especially in extremely dry
   or wet years. The variations of climate and hydrology have much greater
   impacts on the nitrate dynamics than the changes in nitrogen input. This
   study reveals significant seasonal variation in the relations between
   nitrate concentration and influencing factors, which is also closely
   related to the seasonal variation in climate. Assessment of management
   practices and resultant water quality should consider the impact of
   short- and long-term climate dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water and surface water constitute a single dynamic system in
   most parts of the Suwannee River basin due to the presence of karst
   features that facilitate the interaction between the surface and
   subsurface. Low radon-222 concentrations (below background levels) and
   enriched amounts of oxygen-18 and deuterium in ground water indicate
   mixing with surface water in parts of the basin. Comparison of surface
   water and regional ground water flow patterns indicate that boundaries
   for ground water basins typically do not coincide with surface water
   drainage subbasins. There are several areas in the basin where around
   water flow that originates outside of the Suwannee River basin crosses
   surface water basin boundaries during both low-flow and high-flow
   conditions. In a study area adjacent to the Suwannee River that consists
   predominantly of agricultural land use, 18 wells tapping the Upper
   Floridan aquifer and 7 springs were sampled three times during 1990
   through 1994 for major dissolved inorganic constituents, trace elements,
   and nutrients. During a period of above normal rainfall that resulted in
   high river stage and high ground water levels in 1991, the combination
   of increased amounts of dissolved organic carbon and decreased levels of
   dissolved oxygen in ground water created conditions favorable for the
   natural reduction of nitrate by denitrification reactions in the
   aquifer. As a result, less nitrate was discharged by ground water to the
   Suwannee River.}},

Title = {{Predictive assessment of severity of agricultural droughts based on

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Past historical evidence indicates that droughts have had great impacts
   on human life. Drought (or scarcity of water) is assessed based on two
   key factors, namely, the estimated water demand, and the expected water
   supply. The formulation of these key factors for a region largely
   depends on the agro-climatic and economic conditions. Consideration of
   one such key factor is the relationship between the crop yield and water
   deficit in the assessment and prediction of agricultural droughts. The
   varying nature of this relationship from crop to crop adds to the
   complexity of agricultural drought analysis. To overcome this difficulty
   in analyzing agricultural droughts of a region, it is adequate to
   consider and place emphasis on a single crop (i.e., an index crop) grown
   homogeneously over the major area of the region. From one year to
   another year, the pattern of water requirement during the growing season
   of an index crop is rather stationary, and the water supply in arid and
   semi-arid area is mainly from seasonal random precipitation. In a
   region, grain yield of the index crop and, in turn, assessment of the
   severity of drought can reasonably be predicted as a function of the
   time of crop sowing and the distribution of rainfall, provided that
   temporal and spatial effects of other contributing factors (crop
   variety, soil fertility status, crop disease, pest control, cultivation
   practices etc.) on grain yield are considered to be uniformly
   distributed (i.e., stable).
   A predictive method of assessing agricultural droughts in an arid area
   of western India is presented. The major crop (Pearl Millet) of this
   region is grown from July through September. The formulation of the
   proposed predictive method inherently implies that the grain yield of
   the main crop is a reliable indicator of agricultural drought. In the
   development of this predictive relationship (i.e., a regression type
   model) a number of potential yet simple variables affecting the grain
   yield in the region were investigated. The soil moisture index, although
   generally considered significant compared to the simple variables, has
   been found to account for insignificant variation in the grain yield.
   Results of our investigations suggest that it would be advisable to
   exclude the soil moisture index variable from the model. The proposed
   regression model can be used in the prediction of grain yield of the
   main crop several months ahead of crop harvesting operations and, in
   turn, the assessment of agricultural drought severity as mild, moderate,
   or severe. Such an assessment is expected to be helpful to planners for
   arranging appropriate measures to effectively combat agricultural
   drought situations.}},

Abstract = {{Existing leachate prediction models over-or underestimate leachate
   generation by up to three orders of magnitude. Practical experiments
   show that channeled flow in waste leads to rapid discharge of large
   leachate volumes and heterogeneous moisture distributions. In order to
   more accurately predict leachate generation, leachate models must be
   improved. To predict moisture movement through waste, the one-domain
   water balance model HELP, and two-domain PREFLO, are tested.
   Experimental waste and leachate flow values are compared with model
   predictions. When calibrated with experimental parameters, the HELP
   model yields reasonable predictions of cumulative leachate flow and
   PREFLO provides estimates of breakthrough time. In the short term, field
   capacity has to be reduced to 0.12 and effective storage and hydraulic
   conductivity of the waste must be increased to 0.2 and 2.2 cm/s
   respectively. In the long term, a new modeling approach must be
   developed to adequately describe the moisture movement mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{A meandering stream channel was simulated in the Hydraulics Laboratory
   at Colorado State University and a series of tests was conducted using
   four types of vegetation to evaluate the potential effects of vegetation
   on sediment deposition and retention in a stream channel. The data
   collected included average flow velocity, flow depth, length of
   vegetation, density of vegetation, cross-sectional area of the
   vegetative stem, wetted perimeter of the vegetative stem, and injection
   and flushing time. The findings indicated that the vegetation could
   retain from 30 to 70 percent of the deposited sediments. The ability of
   vegetation to entrap and retain sediment is related to the length and
   cross-sectional area of the vegetation. The variables describing the
   flow and the vegetative properties were combined to form a predictive
   parameter, the sedimentation factor (Sd) that can be compared with the
   amount of sediment entrapped by vegetation in a stream system. A
   relation was developed correlating vegetation length to sediment
   retention after flushing for flexibility and rigid vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanization history and flood frequencies were determined in six
   low-order streams in the Puget Lowlands, Washington, for the period
   between the 1940/50s and the 1980/90s. Using discharge records from USGS
   gauging stations, each basin was separated into periods prior to and
   after urban expansion. Four of the study basins exhibited significant
   changes in urbanized area, whereas two of the study basins exhibited
   only limited change in urbanized area and effectively serve as control
   basins. Each of the basins that experienced a significant increase in
   urbanized area exhibited increased flood frequency; pre-urbanization
   10-year recurrence interval discharges correspond to 1 to 4-year
   recurrence interval events in post-urbanization records. In contrast, no
   discernible shift in flood frequency was observed in either of the
   control basins. Spawner survey data available for three of the study
   basins reveal systematic declines in salmon abundance in two urbanizing
   basins and no evidence for decreases in a control basin. These data
   imply a link between ongoing salmon population declines and either
   increased flood frequency or associated changes in habitat structure.}},

Abstract = {{The meteorology, flood hydroclimatology, and socioeconomic impacts of
   the Flood of January 1996 in the Susquehanna River Basin are explored.
   The analysis explains how an unusual storm system brought high
   humidities, high temperatures, strong winds, and heavy rain to the
   basin. The rapid melt of the deep snowpack, combined with the heavy
   rainfall, produced the sudden release of large volumes of water. Because
   the ground surface was frozen or saturated, this water moved primarily
   as overland flow. Thus, the flood waters were not restricted to areas
   immediately adjacent to stream channels and, consequently, some of the
   largest impacts were on people, property, and infrastructure in areas
   not normally prone to flooding. Socioeconomic patterns of flooding over
   time and space are investigated to put this flood into context and to
   highlight its impacts. The analysis concludes that if such overland
   flooding is a more common feature of climate change, then the current
   vulnerability to this form of flooding and its economic implications
   must be considered carefully.}},

Abstract = {{This paper synthesizes and interprets data pertaining to the evolution
   of average water revenue, water use? and the average cost of water
   supply in the City of Santa Barbara, California, from 1986 to 1996, a
   period which included one of the most devastating droughts in California
   this century. The 1987-1992 drought hit the study area particularly
   hard. The City of Santa Barbara was dependent exclusively on local
   sources for its water supply. That made it vulnerable as the regional
   climate is prone to extreme variability and recurrent droughts. The
   1986-1992 drought provided a rare opportunity to assess the sensitivity
   of municipal water use to pricing, conservation, and other water
   management measures under extreme drought conditions. Our analysis
   indicates that the average cost of water rose more than three-fold in
   real terms from 1986 to 1996, while the gap between the average cost of
   supply and the average revenue per unit of water (= 100 cubic feet) rose
   in real terms from \$0.14 in 1986 to \$ 0.75 in 1996. The rise of \$3.08
   in the average cost of supplying one unit of water between 1986 and 1996
   measures the cost of hedging drought risk in the study area. Water use
   dropped 46 percent at the hei:ht of the drought relative to pre-drought
   water use, and remains at 61 percent of the pre-drought level. The data
   derived from the 1987-1992 California drought are unique and valuable
   insofar as shedding light on drought/water demand adaptive interactions.
   The experience garnered on drought management during that unique period
   points to the possibilities available for future water management in the
   Arid West where dwindling water supplies and burgeoning populations are
   facts that we must deal with.}},

Abstract = {{The at-a-station hydraulic geometry of stream channels can serve as a
   predictor of alluvial stream channel behavior. This geometry is the
   empirical relations describing changes in water surface width, mean
   depth, and mean velocity with changing discharge. The exponent values
   are correlated with channel morphology and behavior such as scour and
   fill, flow resistance, bank resistance, and competence. Channel behavior
   and morphology are apparently related, but some causes for effects are
   uncertain. Several studies, using empirical and theoretical bases, are
   reviewed here to illustrate the relation between hydraulic geometry and
   channel behavior, but the relations are not always consistent. Hydraulic
   geometry variables are easy to measure and readily available, but they
   do not always reflect what may be more important ones such as
   turbulence, the velocity distribution profile, and distribution and
   cohesion of sediment particles. This paper illustrates some of these
   problems, provides some solutions, and addresses need for more work to
   better predict stream channel behavior from hydraulic geometry.}},

Abstract = {{The indexed sequential hydrologic modeling (ISM) methodology is utilized
   by the Western Area Power Administration as the basis for risk-based
   estimation of project-dependable hydropower capacity for several
   federally owned/operated projects. ISM is a technique based on synthetic
   generation of a series of overlapping short-term inflow sequences
   obtained directly from the historical record. The validity of ISM is
   assessed through application to the complex multireservoir hydropower
   system of the Colorado River basin for providing risk estimates
   associated with determination of reliable hydrogeneration capacity.
   Performance of ISM is compared with results from stochastically
   generated streamflow input data to the Colorado River Simulation System
   (CRSS). Statistical analysis and comparison of results are based on
   monthly power capacity, energy generation, and downstream water
   deliveries. Results indicate that outputs generated from ISM
   synthetically generated sequences display an acceptable correspondence
   with those obtained from stochastically generated hydrologic data for
   the Colorado River Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Color of natural waters strongly influences their aesthetic appeal,
   suitability for recreational use, and aquatic habitat, but methods for
   routine specification of color have been lacking. An improved method has
   been developed for specifying water colors in the field. The water
   color, seen through an underwater viewer, is matched directly to Munsell
   standard patches observed simultaneously. The Munsell color-matching
   method was verified versus measurements of the underwater light field,
   made with a submersible spectroradiometer in 20 different natural waters
   in New Zealand (mainly lakes), which varied widely in color and other
   optical characteristics. Hue, the most important color attribute of
   natural waters, could be matched accurately; the saturation and
   brightness less so. Color standard patches are not available covering
   the full range of typically dark water colors, but fortunately,

Abstract = {{Evidence is presented that snowmelt runoff from an urban watershed can
   produce density current intrusions (underflows) in a lake. Several
   episodes of density current intrusions are documented. Water
   temperatures and salinities measured near the bottom of a 10 m deep
   Minneapolis lake during the late winter warming periods in 1989, 1990,
   1991, and 1995 show significant rapid changes which are correlated with
   observed higher air temperatures and snowmelt runoff. The snowmelt
   runoff entering this particular lake (Ryan Lake) has increased
   electrical conductivity, salinity, and density. The source of the
   salinity is the sal, spread on urban streets in the winter. Heating of
   littoral waters in spring may also contribute to the occurrence of the
   sinking flows, but is clearly not the only cause.}},

Abstract = {{The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) is used in a non-homogeneous
   Markov chain model to characterize the stochastic behavior of drought.
   Based on this characterization an early warning system in the form of a
   decision tree enumerating all possible sequences of drought progression
   is proposed for drought management. Besides yielding probabilities of
   occurrence of different drought severity classes, the method associates
   a secondary measure in terms of likely cumulative precipitation deficit
   to provide timely guidance in deciding drought mitigation actions. The
   proposed method is particularly useful for water availability task
   forces in various states for issuing drought warnings in advance. The
   applicability of the technique is illustrated for the Tidewater climatic
   division of Virginia.}},

Abstract = {{Dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) contaminated ground water has
   proven to be exceptionally difficult to remediate for both physical and
   chemical reasons. Since DNAPLs are denser than water, their movement is
   not governed by the direction of ground water flow as is generally the
   case for other ground water contaminants. Additionally, DNAPLs'
   interactions with aquifer solids through processes such as sorption tend
   to make the pollution linger or sometimes apparently disappear, only to
   return later. Unfortunately, pump-and-treat systems, the traditional way
   ground water contamination is addressed, have not been effective in
   cleaning DNAPL contaminated water. Other remediation technologies
   continue to be developed to address these problems. Policy changes will
   also be necessary to effectively address the difficulties associated
   with ground water remediation.}},

Abstract = {{In an effort to adopt more holistic ecosystem approaches to resource
   assessment and management, many state and federal agencies have begun
   using watershed or ecoregion frameworks. Although few would question the
   need to make this move from dealing with problems and issues on a case
   by case or point-type basis to broader regional contexts,
   misunderstanding of each of the frameworks has resulted in inconsistency
   in their use and ultimate effectiveness. The focus of this paper is on
   the clarification of both frameworks. We stress that the issue is not
   whether to use watersheds (or basins or hydrologic units) or ecoregions
   for needs such as developing ecosystem management and non-point source
   pollution strategies or structuring water quality regulatory programs,
   but how to correctly use the frameworks together. Definitions, uses, and
   misuses of each of the frameworks are discussed as well as ways
   watersheds and ecoregions can be and have been used together effectively
   to meet resource management needs.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies conducted since the late 1970s have evaluated state
   and federal responses to drought in the United States. Each of these
   studies identified a number of key issues and impediments that needed to
   be addressed to improve the nation's ability to cope with and prepare
   for future episodes of drought. A content analysis of these studies was
   performed to identify common threads in their recommendations. The
   premise of this analysis was that the series of drought years that
   occurred between 1986 and 1992 and recurred between 1994 and 1996
   increased awareness of our nation's continuing and apparent growing
   vulnerability to drought. This awareness has led to greater consensus
   among principal constituents and stakeholders, and also a greater sense
   of urgency to implement actions now to lessen vulnerability. The results
   of this analysis revealed that several themes recur: create an
   integrated national drought policy and plan; develop an integrated
   national climate monitoring (drought watch) system; incorporate drought
   in FEMA's National Mitigation Strategy; conduct pest-drought audits of
   response efforts; establish regional draught forums; and encourage
   development of state drought mitigation plans.}},

Abstract = {{Drought has been a common feature in the United States during the past
   decade and has resulted in significant economic, social, and
   environmental impacts in virtually all parts of the nation. The purpose
   of this paper is two fold. First, the status of state drought planning
   is discussed to illustrate the significant increase in the number of
   states that have prepared response plans - from three states in 1982 to
   27 in 1997. In addition, six states are now in various stages of plan
   development. Second, mitigative actions implemented by states in
   response to the series of severe drought years since 1986 are
   summarized. This information was obtained through a survey of states.
   The study concludes that states have made significant progress in
   addressing drought-related issues and concerns through the planning
   process. However, existing plans are still largely reactive in nature,
   treating drought in an emergency response mode. Mitigative actions
   adopted by states provide a unique archive that may be transferable to
   other states. Incorporating these actions into a more anticipatory, risk
   management approach to drought management will help states move away
   from the traditional crisis management approach.}},

Abstract = {{In Washington's watershed analysis program, scientific analysts identify
   watershed areas that are sensitive to forest practices. Land managers
   then develop watershed-specific rules or `'prescriptions'' that
   condition forestry activities in those sensitive areas. Prescriptions
   are intended to provide greater protection than existing, or
   `'standard,'' roles where necessary to avoid cumulative effects on
   public aquatic resources (fish habitat and public works). To assess
   strengths and opportunities for improving Washington's watershed
   analysis, we evaluate prescriptions from 20 analyses conducted from 1993
   to 1995. We ask: (1) Are prescriptions watershed specific, compared to
   the general, or `'standard'' forest practices rules? (2) Are
   prescriptions scientifically sound? (3) What promotes or limits
   development of watershed-specific and scientifically sound
   prescriptions? We find: (I) Prescriptions tend to be similar to standard
   rules. One reason is that some components of the scientific assessment
   methodology incorporate approaches or assumptions from the standard
   rules, some of which are untested or unsupported. Another reason is that
   while other assessment methods are not patterned after the standard
   rules, resulting prescriptions do not necessarily integrate assessment
   information. (2) Many prescriptions lack a scientific rationale and are
   unproved in meeting their stated objectives. Despite the experimental
   nature of many prescriptions, they generally lack an evaluation
   component. (3) Washington's watershed analysis can be strengthened by:
   testing assumptions of some scientific assessment methods; basing
   prescriptions more rigorously on scientific assessment data and
   published scientific literature; and addressing uncertainty in whether
   prescriptions meet their objectives.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluate Washington's program of watershed analysis with respect to
   its goals as a cumulative effects assessment method, adaptive
   management, and a restoration tool. We also evaluate the program as a
   framework for implementing ecosystem management. A strength of the
   cumulative effects assessment method is in identifying and reducing the
   dominant, direct physical effects of forest land uses on salmonid
   habitat. This could be further strengthened by more emphasis on
   identifying problems that can be immediately remedied (e.g., identifying
   road erosion and landslide trigger sites; correctly locating
   fish-bearing waters, and identifying anthropogenic fish passage
   impediments). More effectively assessing and integrating changes from
   more than one type of input to streams, including all relevant inputs,
   and examining whether assumptions about those inputs are scientifically
   defensible, will also improve the cumulative effects assessment.
   Treating experimentation more formally, including placing a greater
   emphasis on monitoring the outcome of prescriptions, and determining the
   scientific defensibility and certainty level of prescriptions, will
   strengthen adaptive management. As a watershed restoration tool, the
   program needs defined goals and critical assessment methods (e.g., of
   historic productive capacity of aquatic habitat). To be consistent with
   ecosystem management, analyses need to be integrated into a larger
   spatial scale, and to include all relevant land uses and effects within
   that scale; objectives for various stream `'inputs'' need to be
   evaluated with respect to managing for ecological integrity and the
   ability to provide a measurable standard.}},

Abstract = {{Large deviations in average annual air temperatures and total annual
   precipitation were observed across the southern United States during the
   last 50 years, and these fluctuations could become even larger during
   the next century. We used PnET-IIS, a monthly time-step forest process
   model that uses soil, vegetation, and climate inputs to assess the
   influence of changing climate on southern U.S. pine forest water use.
   After model predictions of historic drainage were validated the
   potential influences of climate change on loblolly pine forest water use
   was assessed across the region using historic (1951 to 1984) monthly
   precipitation and air temperature which were modified by two general
   circulation models (GCMs). The GCMs predicted a 3.2 degrees C to 7.2
   degrees C increase in average monthly air temperature, a -24 percent to
   +31 percent change in monthly precipitation and a -1 percent to +3
   percent change in annual precipitation. As a comparison to the GCMs, a
   minimum climate change scenario using a constant 2 degrees C increase in
   monthly air temperature and a 20 percent increase in monthly
   precipitation was run in conjunction with historic climate data.
   Predicted changes in forest water drainage were highly dependent on the
   GCM used. PnET-IIS predicted that along the northern range of loblolly
   pine, water yield would decrease with increasing leaf area, total
   evapotranspiration and soil water stress. However, across most of the
   southern U.S., PnET-IIS predicted decreased leaf area, total
   evapotranspiration, and soil water stress with an associated increase in
   water yield. Depending on the GCM and geographic location, predicted
   leaf area decreased to a point which would no longer sustain loblolly
   pine forests, and thus indicated a decrease in the southern most range
   of the species within the region. These results should be evaluated in
   relation to other changing environmental factors (i.e., CO2 and O-3)
   which are not present in the current model.}},

Abstract = {{Freezing winter temperatures can cause icing of outdoor weirs used to
   measure surface runoff. Ice typically forms in the notch and on the
   crests of short-crested V-notch weirs, causing incorrect gage heights to
   be measured. A method for reducing the effects of ice formation on weirs
   and weir pools using a pump is presented and evaluated. Warmer water
   from the bottom of the weir pool is pumped to the surface, reducing the
   opportunity for the water surface to freeze. The pump is shown to work
   except under extremely cold conditions, improving runoff records from 27
   percent to 60 percent. The pump system has no practical effect on
   measured gage height. Frequency distributions of flow rates and air
   temperatures under measured ice-free and other weir conditions are
   presented. Suggestions Far use of the pump system under temperature
   conditions other than those in this study are given.}},

Abstract = {{Californian annual grassland on sandstone (moderately fertile) and
   serpentine (very infertile) soils at the Jasper Ridge Biological
   Preserve, Stanford, California, were exposed to ambient or elevated
   (ambient + 36 Pa CO2) atmospheric CO2 in open-top chambers since
   December 1991. We measured ecosystem evapotranspiration with open
   gas-exchange systems, and soil moisture with time-domain reflectometry
   (TDR) over 0-15 cm (serpentine) and 0-30 cm (sandstone) depths, at times
   of peak above ground physiological activity. Evapotranspiration
   decreased by 12 to 63 percent under elevated CO2 in three consecutive
   years in the sandstone ecosystem (p = 0.053, p = 0.162, p = 0.082 in
   1992, 1993, and 1994, respectively). In correspondence with decreased
   evapotranspiration, late-season soil moisture reserves in the sandstone
   were extended temporally by 10 +/- 3 days in 1993 and by 28 +/- 11 days

   annual rainfall). In the serpentine ecosystem, evapotranspiration and
   soil moisture reserves were not clearly affected by elevated CO2. Soil
   water may be conserved in drought-affected ecosystems exposed to
   elevated CO2, but the amount of conservation appears to depend on the
   relative importance of transpiration and soil evaporation in controlling
   water flux.}},

Abstract = {{The Gunnison River in the Gunnison Gorge is a canyon river where
   upstream dams regulate mainstem discharge but do not affect debris-flow
   sediment supply from tributaries entering below the reservoirs.
   Regulation since 1966 has altered flood frequency, streambed mobility,
   and fluvial geomorphology creating potential resource-management issues.
   The duration of moderate streamflows between 32.3 and 85.0 m(3)/s has
   increased threefold since 1966. This, along with flood-peak attenuation,
   has facilitated fine-sediment deposition and vegetation encroachment on
   stream banks. The Shields equation and on-site channel geometry and
   bed-material measurements were used to assess changes in sediment
   entrainment in four alluvial reaches. Sand and fine gravel are
   transported through riffle/pool reaches at most discharges, but the
   cobbles and boulders composing the streambed in many reaches now are
   infrequently entrained. Periodic debris flows add coarse sediment to
   rapids and can increase pool elevation and the streambed area affected
   by backwater and fine-sediment accumulation. Debris-flow supplied
   boulders accumulate on fans and in rapids and constrict the channel
   until reworked by larger floods. The response to streamflow-regime
   changes in the Gunnison Gorge could serve as an analog for alluvial
   reaches in other regulated canyon rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Growing interest in agricultural irrigation in the Great Lakes basin
   presents an increasing competition to other uses of Great Lakes water.
   This paper, through a case study of the Mud Creek Irrigation District in
   the Saginaw Bay basin, Michigan, evaluates the potential hydrologic
   effects of withdrawing water for agricultural irrigation to the Great
   Lakes. Crop growth simulation models for corn, soybeans, dry beans, and
   the FAO Penman method were used to estimate the difference in
   evapotranspiration rates between irrigated and nonirrigated identical
   crops, based on climate, soil, and management data. The simulated
   results indicate that an additional 70-120 mm of water would be
   evapotranspirated during the growing season from irrigated crop fields
   as compared to nonirrigated identical plantings. Dependent upon the
   magnitude of irrigation expansion, an equivalent of about 1 to 5 mm of
   water from Lakes Huron-Michigan could be lost to the atmosphere. If
   agricultural irrigation further expands in the entire Great Lakes basin,
   the aggregated potential of water loss to the atmosphere through ET from
   all five Great Lakes would be even greater.}},

Abstract = {{Proper selection of curve number values will improve the capability of
   the SCS-Curve Number procedure in predicting runoff. Both CREAMS and
   GLEAMS models use the Smith and Williams (1980) approach of converting
   CNII (curve number value for average antecedent moisture conditions)
   into CNI (curve number value for dry antecedent moisture conditions) in
   calculating the soil retention parameter (S). CREAMS and GLEAMS have
   been found to under predict runoff because of the internal conversion of
   CNII to CNI. This study shows modifications of the GLEAMS model using
   CNII without converting it to CNI and it also shows the seasonal curve
   number approaches with and without converting CNII to CNI. Results
   indicate that using CMI without internal conversion to CNI provides
   better runoff and erosion predictions than the original version of
   GLEAMS and versions with seasonal curve numbers when tested with four
   years of field data in the Coastal Plain physiographic region of

Abstract = {{Urbanization of a watershed degrades both the form and the function of
   the downstream aquatic system, causing changes that can occur rapidly
   and are very difficult to avoid or correct. A variety of physical data
   from lowland streams in western Washington displays the onset of readily
   observable aquatic-system degradation at a remarkably consistent level
   of development, typically about ten percent effective impervious area in
   a watershed. Even lower levels of urban development cause significant
   degradation in sensitive water bodies and a reduced, but less well
   quantified, level of function throughout the system as a whole.
   Unfortunately, established methods of mitigating the downstream impacts
   of urban development may have only limited effectiveness. Using
   continuous hydrologic modeling we have evaluated detention ponds
   designed by conventional event methodologies, and our findings
   demonstrate serious deficiencies in actual pond performance when
   compared to their design goals. Even with best efforts at mitigation,
   the sheer magnitude of development activities falling below a level of
   regulatory concern suggests that increased resource lass will invariably
   accompany development of a watershed. Without a better understanding of
   the critical processes that lead to degradation, some downstream
   aquatic-system damage is probably inevitable without limiting the extent
   of watershed development itself.}},

Abstract = {{Gaging stations established in 1895 at Millville, West Virginia and in
   1882 at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia record flows ranging from a maximum
   of 6,509 m(3)s(-1), to a minimum of 2 m(3)s(-1) Historical and botanical
   indicators were used to extend the systematic flood record of the
   Shenandoah River for a study reach approximately 7.5-km long. The long
   systematic record at the site provides a good opportunity to assess the
   accuracy of these sources of paleoflood information. Habitation of the
   area by settlers of European descent began in 1733, and historical flood
   records extend from 1748. Qualitative historical records from different
   sources were compared to yield the most complete flood history. The
   correlation between the various sources was extremely high. Botanical
   flood evidence preserved as adventitious sprouts, tree scars, and ring
   anomalies were documented in 37 trees. A flood chronology established
   from these data extended from 1896 to 1955. Botanical indicators
   provided an accurate, although incomplete, flood chronology. The ability
   to determine accurate flood stages from paleohydrologic indicators
   varied. Historical data yielded relatively accurate stages to within 1-2
   m; only minimum values of flood stage could be obtained from botanical
   indicators. These results illustrate some of the strengths and
   weaknesses of paleohydrologic investigations in the eastern United
   States.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional and two-dimensional modeling approaches were compared
   for their abilities in predicting overland runoff and sediment
   transport. Both 1-D and 2-D models were developed to test the hypothesis
   that the 2-D modeling approach could improve the model predictions over
   the 1-D approach, based on the same mathematical representations of
   physical processes for runoff and sediment transport. The models
   developed in this study were applied to overland areas with cross
   slopes. A hypothetical case and an experimental study reported by Storm
   (1991) were used. Based on the simulation results from the selected
   hypothetical case and experimental study, the 2-D model provided better
   representation of spatial distribution of flow depths and sediment
   concentrations than the 1-D model. However, no significant differences
   in predictions of total runoff volume and sediment yield at the outlet
   area were found between the 1-D and 2-D models.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal variability of dissolved oxygen (DO),
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrate concentration and total
   coliform (TC) were investigated at nine sampling stations distributed
   along the main rivers of the Piracicaba River Basin, a 12,400 km(2)
   catchment located in Sao Paulo State, one of the most developed regions
   of Brazil. Spatially, a downstream impoverishment of water quality
   conditions was observed, as seen by the decrease of DO, and increase of
   BOD, nitrate, and TC. These changes were probably caused by accumulating
   downstream discharge of domestic and industrial sewage. Temporal
   evaluation of 18 years of data showed that DO decreased with time for
   the majority of the sampling stations, while BOD, nitrate, and TC
   increased. A law, approved at the end of 1991, proposed a new water tax
   for river water extraction for industrial and agricultural use. The
   amount of this tax is determined according to the water quality of the
   extracted water. Therefore, the evaluation of the water quality status
   in this basin is a first step to help resources managers to determine
   the values for this tax.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{The use of scientific knowledge in environmental policy making is an
   important topic. However, the relation between knowledge producers and
   policy makers is not a straightforward producer-user relationship. The
   development of a national desiccation policy in the Netherlands and the
   implementation of desiccation plans in local situations are used as a
   case study to investigate the knowledge policy relationship. Three
   theoretical explanations were used to analyze this case: a difference
   between the cultures of producers and users; a different rationality of
   the policy making and research processes; and processes of social
   construction of problem definitions which imply that different knowledge
   stocks are used depending on the framing of the policy problem.
   Emergence of the policy issue at the national level is demonstrated to
   develop in close interaction between knowledge producers and policy
   makers, while the interactions at the local level were more based on
   integration of expert knowledge through personal expertise and closely
   tied to the development of management plans. This case study:hus reveals
   a difference between general knowledge supporting measures at the
   national policy level and the way in which specific knowledge is applied
   in local cases. Therefore more attention should be paid to the
   translation of policy problems from rather high levels of political
   authority to the conceptualization at lower management levels. A final
   conclusion is that knowledge use in Dutch desiccation policy can be
   understood by pointing to multiple theoretical perspectives. The
   rational actor model and a constructivist perspective turned out to be
   especially useful in explaining the different ways knowledge was used at
   the national and the local level.}},

Abstract = {{On May 19, 1993, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the Western
   District of New York found Southview Farm and Richard H. Popp guilty of
   violating the Clean Water Act on five occasions. The violations were the
   result of storm water runoff from a site used for disposal of dairy
   cattle manure from an unpermitted concentrated animal feeding operation.
   The presiding District Court judge later dismissed the jury verdict, and
   subsequently a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the
   dismissal. The Court of Appeals concluded that the discharges were not
   exempt as agricultural storm water discharges, and that the manure
   spreaders involved were point sources. Because the use of animal manures
   in crop production activities will result, unavoidably, in the discharge
   of some pollutants to adjacent surface waters, a rational and
   universally applicable basis is needed to determine when such discharges
   are point versus nonpoint source. Current statutes and regulations do
   not delineate clearly such a boundary. To address this lack of
   specificity, I propose that application rates be based on recommended
   crop nutrient needs.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated watershed ecosystem studies in National Parks or equivalent
   reserves suggest that effects of external ?recesses on `'protected''
   resources are subtle, chronic, and long-term. Ten years of data from
   National Park watersheds suggests that temperature and precipitation
   changes are linked to nitrogen levels in lakes and streams. We envision
   measurable biotic effects in these remote watersheds, if expected
   climate trends continue. The condition of natural resources within areas
   set aside for preservation are difficult to ascertain, but gaining this
   knowledge is the key to understanding ecosystem change and of processes
   operating among biotic and abiotic ecosystem components. There is
   increasing evidence that understanding the magnitude of variation within
   and between such processes can provide an early indication of
   environmental change and trends attributable to human-induced stress.
   The following four papers are case studies of how this concept has been
   implemented.{*} These long-term studies have expand ed our knowledge of
   ecosystem response to natural and human-induced stress. The existence of
   these sites with a commitment to gathering `'long-term'' ecosystem-level
   data permits research activities aimed at testing more important

Abstract = {{We have developed an approach which examines ecosystem function and the
   potential effects of climatic shifts. The Lake McDonald watershed of
   Glacier National Park was the focus for two linked research activities:
   acquisition of baseline data on hydrologic, chemical and aquatic
   organism attributes that characterize this pristine northern rocky
   mountain watershed, and further developing the Regional Hydro-Ecosystem
   Simulation System (RHESSys), a collection of integrated models which
   collectively provide spatially explicit, mechanistically-derived outputs
   of ecosystem processes, including hydrologic outflow, soil moisture, and
   snowpack water equivalence. In this unique setting field validation of
   RHESSys, outputs demonstrated that reasonable estimates of SWE and
   streamflow are being produced. RHESSys was used to predict annual stream
   discharge and temperature. The predictions, in conjunction with the
   field data, indicated that aquatic resources of the park may be
   significantly affected. Utilizing RHESSys to predict potential climate
   scenarios and response of other key ecosystem components can provide
   scientific insights as well as proactive guidelines for national park
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Weekly precipitation and stream water samples were collected from small
   watersheds in Denali National Park, Alaska, the Fraser Experimental
   Forest, Colorado, Isle Royale National Park, Michigan, and the Calumet
   watershed on the south shore of Lake Superior, Michigan. The objective
   was to determine if stream water chemistry at the mouth and upstream
   stations reflected precipitation chemistry across a range of atmospheric
   inputs of H+, NH4+, NO3-, and SO42-. Volume-weighted precipitation H+,
   NH4+, NO3-, and SO42- concentrations varied 4 to 8 fold with
   concentrations highest at Calumet and lowest in Denali. Stream water
   chemistry varied among sites, but did not reflect precipitation
   chemistry. The Denali watershed, Rock Creek, had the lowest
   precipitation NO3- and SO42- concentrations, but the highest stream
   water NO3- and SO42- concentrations. Among sites, the ratio of mean
   monthly upstream NO3- concentration to precipitation NO3- concentration
   declined (p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.47) as precipitation NO3- concentration
   increased. The ratio of mean monthly upstream to precipitation SO42-
   concentration showed no significant relationship to change in
   precipitation SO42-. concentration. Watersheds showed strong retention
   of inorganic N (> 90 percent inputs) across inputs ranging from 0.12 to
   > 6 kg N ha(-1) y(-1). Factors possibly accounting for the weak or
   non-existent signal between stream water and precipitation ion
   concentrations include rapid modification of meltwater and precipitation
   chemistry by soil processes, and the presence of unfrozen soils which
   permits winter mineralization and nitrification to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Human induced long-term changes in precipitation and stream chemistry
   have been observed in eastern North America and Europe, but few
   long-term studies have been conducted in coastal western North America.
   The objectives of this research were to determine: (1) time trends in
   precipitation and stream chemistry in a pristine old-growth forest
   watershed, and (2) seasonal patterns in precipitation and stream
   chemistry. It was conducted in 58 ha West Twin Creek Watershed, Hoh
   River Valley, Olympic National Park, Washington from 1984 to 1993.
   Vegetation consists of old-growth forest, with western hemlock,
   Douglas-fir, western redcedar, Pacific silver fir, and Sitka spruce
   being the dominant tree species. Annual precipitation varied from 2336
   to 4518 mm during the study period with the majority of the rain falling
   between October and May. Chemistry of precipitation was strongly
   dominated by oceanic influences with Na and Cl being the dominant ions.
   The chemistry of the stream was influenced by bedrock weathering and was
   dominated by Ca, HCO3, and SO4 and was not strongly related to
   precipitation chemistry. The pH of precipitation averaged 5.3 over time
   and ranged from 4.3 to 7.1, while the stream pH averaged 7.5 and ranged
   from 5.5 to 9.0. There were few long-term trends in the chemical
   constituents of bulk precipitation or stream water with the exception of
   a slight decrease in NO3 in precipitation and an increase of SO4 in
   stream water. A trend of decreasing concentrations of Ca, Mg and Na in
   precipitation also occurred. There were no significant seasonal patterns
   in precipitation although the highest SO4 concentrations usually
   occurred in late spring and summer perhaps due marine algal activity.
   Strong seasonal trends occurred in concentrations of HCO3, SO4, Ca, Mg,
   and Na in stream water resulting from weathering and stream flow
   patterns, with highest ion concentrations occurring just before the
   onset of the rainy season. Pulses of NO3 in the stream were observed
   during fall and early winter resulting from the release of NO3 which had
   accumulated in soils or sediments.}},

Abstract = {{The National Park Service and the National Biological Service initiated
   research in Denali National Park and Preserve, a 2.4 million-hectare
   park in southcentral Alaska, to develop ecological monitoring protocols
   for national parks in the Arctic/Subarctic biogeographic area. We are
   focusing pilot studies on design questions, on scaling issues and
   regionalization, ecosystem structure and function, indicator selection
   and evaluation, and monitoring technologies. Rock Creek, a headwater
   stream near Denali headquarters, is the ecological scale for initial
   testing of a watershed ecosystem approach. Our conceptual model embraces
   principles of the hydrological cycle, hypotheses of global climate
   change, and biological interactions of organisms occupying intermediate,
   but poorly studied, positions in Alaskan food webs. The field approach
   includes hydrological and depositional considerations and a suite of
   integrated measures linking key aquatic and terrestrial biota,
   environmental variables, or defined ecological processes, in order to
   establish ecological conditions and detect, track, and understand
   mechanisms of environmental change. Our sampling activities include
   corresponding measures of physical, chemical, and biological attributes
   in four Rock Creek habitats believed characteristic of the greater
   system diversity of Denali. This paper gives examples of data sets,
   program integration and scaling, and research needs.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to discuss the importance of uncertainty
   analysis in water quality modeling, with an emphasis on the
   identification of the correct model specification. A wetland phosphorus
   retention model is used as an example to illustrate the procedure of
   using a filtering technique for model structure identification. Model
   structure identification is typically done through model parameter
   estimation. However, due to many sources of error in both model
   parameterization and observed variables and data, error-in-variable is
   often a problem. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use the least
   squares method for parameter estimation. Two alternative methods for
   parameter estimation are presented. The first method is the maximum
   likelihood estimator, which assumes independence of the observed
   response variable values. In anticipating the possible violation of the
   independence assumption, a second method, which coupled a maximum
   likelihood estimator and Kalman filter model, was presented.
   Furthermore, a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm is presented as a
   preliminary method for judging whether the model structure is
   appropriate or not.}},

Abstract = {{Pollutants in urban storm water runoff, a significant and increasing
   fraction of pollutants in some waters of the U.S., originate from
   multiple activities. The industrial sector one source category, is
   subject to federal and state-level storm water pollution prevention
   regulations, primarily General NPDES permits that rely heavily on
   facility operators to identify themselves and develop appropriate
   site-specific pollutant controls. Degree of compliance is not readily
   determined and enforcement is inhibited because no publicly-available
   inventories contain data necessary to comprehensively identify
   facilities required to comply. This research evaluates the first stage
   of compliance, facility self-identification concentrating on the
   motor-vehicle transportation industry category using data at three
   scales: statewide, regional, and local or watershed. Data for California
   statewide and for the Los Angeles region show about 8 percent to 15
   percent of motor-vehicle transportation facilities have complied with
   first-stage requirements. However, facility-specific evaluation in one
   Los Angeles County watershed suggests less than 50 percent of facilities
   in the industry conduct industrial activities of the kind covered by
   regulations; others need not comply. Results show strong variation by
   industry category. Second-stage compliance, follow-up reporting, is also
   evaluated for the Los Angeles region. About 17 percent to 34 percent of
   facilities completing first-stage requirements have also completed
   second-stage requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Flow has been diverted from Rocky Mountain streams for many years with
   little documentation of the impacts on physical form and biological
   function of the losing stream system. This study addresses whether
   differences in form can be detected in subalpine step-pool, plane bed,
   or pool-riffle channels and linked to changes in flow regime from
   diversion. Total annual discharge was reduced between 20 and 60 percent
   and average annual peak flow was reduced up to 45 percent in the
   subalpine systems assessed; channels were diverted between 20 and 100
   years. Expected impacts include reduced conveyance and changes in
   vegetation growth patterns because formerly active surfaces are
   colonized by riparian species, effectuating shrinking channel capacity.
   In this study, reduced channel width is used as an indicator of
   morphologic response. Observed reductions in width, ranging from 35 to
   50 percent at some sites, resulted not only from vegetation invasion of
   stable surfaces but also from the development of an inset beside former
   cut banks. This observation, however, was restricted to wider
   pool-riffle channels with gravel bars. Outside of these areas,
   morphologic changes were either subtle or absent. The absence of
   widespread response is attributed primarily to periodic `'flooding'' of
   the diverted channel. During wetter-than-average years when excess water
   is available, minimal flow is diverted and the hydrograph resembles a
   free-flowing regime. The release of high flow to the natural channel
   potentially offsets changes in form incurred during `'dry'' periods. The
   stable nature and structure of subalpine channels also contributes to
   the absence of reduced capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Stream meander restoration designs currently used by many state and
   local government agencies are often based on empirical equations, such
   as those developed by Leopold and Wolman (1957; 1960). In order to
   assess the suitability of these equations and propose alternative
   strategies, 18 sites in Central Maryland were selected and data on
   channel planform, cross-sections, sediments, and spacing and sizing of
   the pools and riffles were collected and analyzed to characterize the
   channel type in the study area. A large bias was found comparing the
   meander parameters measured to those computed using the Leopold and
   Wolman equations for the streams in central Maryland. Based on these
   results, appropriate empirical equations for the study area that can
   assist in stream restoration designs were investigated. An addition al
   approach that can assist in stream restoration consists of the
   application of a detailed stream reconnaissance to verify that the
   restoration project is consistent with the natural farm and processes of
   the river.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle grazing practices in the western United States have contributed
   to widespread riparian degradation resulting in unstable channel
   morphologies and the loss of fish habitat. Because of prolonged
   disturbance, numerous riparian areas oil both public and private lands
   have been fenced to exclude cattle in order to promote vegetation
   establishment and riparian improvement. We selected four gravel-bedded,
   steep alluvial streams in eastern Oregon with cattle exclosures greater
   than 14 years old for an analysis of geomorphic adjustments following
   the removal of cattle grazing. We compare channels inside exclosures and
   in adjacent grazed reaches to identify the salient stream channel
   properties that respond to the removal of riparian stresses and to
   document the magnitude of these changes. Results indicate that
   significant changes occur, with reductions in bankfull dimensions and
   increases in pool area being the most common and identifiable changes.
   At all four sites, bankfull widths are narrower by 10 to 20 percent, and
   the percentage of channel area occupied by pools is higher in the
   exclosure by 8 to 15 percent. The increase in pool area is primarily
   offset by a reduction in the percent glide area. Not all of the channel
   properties demonstrate adjustment, indicating that perhaps 14 years is
   an insufficient duration for these variables to adjust.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat unit classification can be a useful descriptive tool in
   hierarchical stream classification. However, a critical evaluation
   reveals that it is applied inappropriately when used to quantify aquatic
   habitat or channel morphology in an attempt to monitor the response of
   individual streams to human activities. First, due to the subjectivity
   of the measure, observer bias seriously compromises repeatability,
   precision, and transferability of the method. Second, important
   geomorphic and ecological changes in stream habitats are not always
   manifested as changes in habitat-unit frequency or characteristics.
   Third, classification data are nominal, which can intrinsically limit
   their amenability to statistical analysis. Finally, using the frequency
   of specific habitat unit types (e.g., pool/riffle ratio or percent pool)
   as a response variable for stream monitoring commonly leads to the
   establishment of management thresholds or targets for habitat-unit
   types. This, in turn, encourages managers to focus on direct
   manipulation or replacement of habitat structures while neglecting
   long-term maintenance or re-establishment of habitat-forming biophysical
   processes. Stream habitat managers and scientists should only use
   habitat unit classification to descriptively stratify in-stream
   conditions. They should not use habitat unit classification as a means
   of quantifying and monitoring aquatic habitat and channel morphology.
   Monitoring must instead focus on direct, repeatable, cost-efficient, and
   quantitative measures of selected physical, chemical, and biological
   components and processes spanning several scales of resolution.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A study was conducted to determine the effects of mining and reclaiming
   originally undisturbed watersheds on surface-water hydrology in three
   small experimental watersheds in Ohio. Approximately six years of data
   were collected at each site, with differing lengths of premining (Phase
   1), mining and reclamation (Phase 2), and post-reclamation (Phase 3)
   periods. Mining and reclamation activities showed no consistent pattern
   in base-flow, and caused slightly more frequent higher daily flow
   volumes. Phase 2 activities can cause reductions in seasonal variation
   in double mass curves compared with Phase 1. Restoration of seasonal
   variations was noticeably apparent at one site during Phase 3. The
   responses of the watersheds to rainfall intensities causing larger peak
   flow rates generally decreased due to mining and reclamation, but tended
   to exceed responses observed in Phase 1 during Phase 3. Natural
   Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) curve numbers increased due to
   mining and reclamation (Phase 2), ranging from 83 to 91. During Phase 3,
   curve numbers remained approximately constant from Phase 2, ranging from
   87 to 91.}},

Abstract = {{The key events and the process that led to the creation of the World
   Water Council on World Water Day 1996 are reviewed and its
   characteristics summarized. The development of this new organization is
   discussed in the context of the major global trends in water and
   water-related issues, viz, growing water scarcity with its links to
   limits on food production and demographic patterns. In response to the
   need to find solutions to these pressing water issues, the development
   of a Technical Program based on the deliberations of the founding member
   organizations and a number of short-term activities have been outlined
   to demonstrate the evolution of the Council in this first year of its
   existence. Given the importance of complementarity between the Council
   and the Global Water Partnership, an attempt has been made to articulate
   the mutually-reinforcing roles of the two organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality variables were sampled over 109 weeks along Coweeta Creek,
   a fifth-order stream located in the Appalachian mountains of western
   North Carolina. The purpose of this study was to observe any changes in
   water quality, over a range of flow conditions, with concomitant
   downstream changes in the mix of landuses. Variables sampled include pH,
   HCO32-, conductivity, NO3--N, NH4+-N, PO43--P, Cl-,Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+,
   SO42-, SiO2, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, total and fecal
   coliform, and fecal streptococcus. Landcover/landuse was interpreted
   from 1:20,000 aerial photographs and entered in a GIS, along with
   information on total and paved road length, building location and
   density, catchment boundaries, hydrography, and slope. Linear
   regressions were performed to relate basin and near-stream landscape
   variables to water quality.
   Consistent, cumulative, downstream changes in water quality variables
   were observed along Coweeta Creek, concomitant with downstream human
   caused changes in landuse. Furthermore, larger downstream changes in
   water quality variables were observed during stormflow when compared to
   baseflow, suggesting cumulative impacts due to landscape alteration
   under study conditions were much greater during storm events. Although
   most water quality regulations, legislation, and sampling are
   promulgated for baseflow conditions, this work indicates they should
   also consider the cumulative impacts of physical, chemical, and
   biological water quality during stormflow.}},

Abstract = {{In order to assess the effects of silvicultural and drainage practices
   on water quality it is necessary to understand their impacts on
   hydrology. The hydrology of a 340 ha artificially drained forested
   watershed in eastern North Carolina was studied for a five-year period
   (1988-92). Effects of soils, beds and changes in vegetation on water
   table depth, evapotranspiration (ET) and drainage outflows were
   analyzed. Total annual outflows from the watershed varied from 29
   percent of the rainfall during the driest year (1990) when mostly mature
   trees were present to as much as 53 percent during a year of normal
   rainfall (1992) after about a third of the trees were harvested. Annual
   ET from the watershed, calculated as the difference between annual
   rainfall and outflow, varied from 76 percent of the calculated potential
   ET for a dry year to as much as 99 percent for a wet year. Average
   estimated ET was 58 percent of rainfall for the five-year period. Flow
   rates per unit area were consistently higher from a smaller harvested
   block (Block B - 82 ha) of the watershed than from the watershed as a
   whole. This is likely due to time lags, as drainage water flows through
   the ditch-canal network in the watershed, and to timber harvesting of
   the smaller gaged block.}},

   for the Upper Colorado River Basin from the Colorado-Utah State line to

   sites in the upper parts of the basin in areas influenced by increasing
   urbanization. Sites were grouped according to land use and site type,
   and median nutrient concentrations were compared among groups. Sites
   within the agricultural areas of the basin generally had the highest
   concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus; concentrations for mainstem,
   tributary and urbanization sites were slightly lower than for the
   agricultural sites. Background sites, or sites with minimal land-use
   impacts, had very low median nutrient concentrations. Several sites with
   long-term data were analyzed for temporal trends in concentrations.
   Several statistically significant downward trends of low and moderate

Abstract = {{Ground water nitrate contamination and water level decline are common
   concern in Nebraska. Effects of artificial recharge on ground water
   quality and aquifer storage recovery (ASR) were studied with spreading
   basins constructed in the highly agricultural region of the Central
   Platte, Nebraska. A total of 1.10 million m(3) of Platte River water
   recharged the aquifer through 5000 m(2) of the recharge basins during
   1992, 1993, and 1994. This is equivalent to the quantity needed to
   completely displace the ground water beneath 34 ha of the local primary
   aquifer with 13 m thickness and 0.25 porosity. Successful NO3-N
   remediation was documented beneath and downgradient of the recharge
   basins, where NO3-N declined from 20 to 2 mg L-1. Ground water atrazine
   concentrations at the site decreased from 2 to 0.2 mg L-1 due to
   recharge. Both NO3-N and atrazine contamination dramatically improved
   from concentrations exceeding the maximum contaminant levels to those of
   drinking water quality. The water table at the site rose rapidly in
   response to recharge during the early stage then leveled off as
   infiltration rates declined. At the end of the 1992 recharge season, the
   water table 12 m downgradient from the basins was elevated 1.36 m above
   the preproject level; however, at the end of the 1993 recharge season,
   any increase in the water table from artificial recharge was masked by
   extremely slow infiltration rates and heavy recharge from precipitation
   from the wettest growing season in over 100 years. The water table rose
   1.37 m during the 1994 recharge season. Resultant ground water quality
   and ASR improvement from the artificial recharge were measured at 1000 m
   downgradient and 600 m upgradient from the recharge basins. Constant
   infiltration rates were not sustained in any of the three years, and
   rates always decreased with time presumably because of clogging.
   Scraping the basin floor increased infiltration rates. Using a pulsed
   recharge to create dry and wet cycles and maintaining low standing water
   heads in the basins appeared to reduce microbial growth, and therefore
   enhanced infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{A 1990 nitrogen and phosphorus mass balance calculated for eight
   National Stream Quality Accounting Network (NASQAN) basins in the
   Albemarle-Pamlico Drainage Basin indicated the importance of
   agricultural nonpoint sources of nitrogen and phosphorus and watershed
   nitrogen retention and processing capabilities. Basin total nitrogen and
   phosphorus input estimates were calculated for atmospheric deposition
   (which averaged 27 percent of total nitrogen inputs and 22 percent of
   total phosphorus inputs); crop fertilizer (27 and 25 percent);
   animal-waste (22 and 50 percent, respectively); point sources (3 percent
   each of total nitrogen and total phosphorus inputs); and biological
   nitrogen fixation (21 percent of total nitrogen inputs). Highest
   in-stream nitrogen and phosphorus loads were measured in predominantly
   agricultural drainage areas. Intermediate loads were observed in mixed
   agricultural/urban drainage areas; the lowest loads were measured in
   mixed agricultural/forested drainage areas. The difference between the
   sum of the nutrient input categories and the sum of the in-stream
   nutrient loads and crop-harvest nutrient removal was assigned to a
   residual category for the basin. The residual category averaged 51
   percent of total nitrogen inputs and 54 percent of total phosphorus
   inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Non-point source pollution continues to be an important environmental
   and water quality management problem. For the most part, analysis of
   non-point source pollution in watersheds has depended on the use of
   distributed models to identify potential problem areas and to assess the
   effectiveness of alternative management practices. To effectively use
   these models for watershed water quality management, users depend on
   integrated geographic information systems (GIS)-based interfaces for
   input/output data management. However, existing interfaces are ad-hoc
   and the utility of GIS is limited to organization of input data and
   display of output data. A highly interactive water quality modeling
   interface that utilizes the functional components and analytical
   capability of GIS is highly desirable. This paper describes the tight
   coupling of the Agricultural Non-point Source (AGNPS) water quality
   model and ARC/INFO GIS software to provide an interactive hybrid
   modeling environment for evaluation of non-point source pollution in a
   watershed. The modeling environment is designed to generate AGNPS input
   parameters from user-specified GIS coverages, create AGNPS input data
   files, control AGNPS model simulations, and extract and organize AGNPS
   model output data for display. An example application involving the
   estimation of pesticide loading in a southern Iowa agricultural
   watershed demonstrates the capability of the modeling environment.
   Compared with traditional methods of watershed water quality modeling
   using the AGNPS model or other ad-hoc interfaces between a distributed
   model and GIS, the interactive modeling environment system is efficient
   and significantly reduces the task of watershed analysis using tightly
   coupled GIS databases and distributed models.}},

Abstract = {{Proxy climate data for the last 500 years collected from the archives of
   counties in the Yangtze River Delta, China, were analyzed to identify
   the occurrence of extreme climate events, the pattern of such
   occurrences and their relationships to El Nino Southern Oscillation
   (ENSO). This study identified the cycle periods of 3.5, 5.5 and 8.6
   years for floods and 18.5 years for droughts in the Yangtze River Delta
   during the last 500 year period and noted 16 regional (delta wide)
   extreme events during this period. All regional (delta wide) extreme
   climate events during the last 500 years (since 1500 A.D.) occurred
   either during or immediately after ENSO (5-6 year) activities.
   Hydrological impacts of extreme climate events, such as major floods and
   droughts, on human systems have long been among the foremost concerns of
   the Pacific Rim countries. Management of systems increasingly dominated
   by humans, such as Asian delta regions, should, therefore, include
   consideration of major climate variability, ENSO events and the extent
   of climate changes, as well as consideration of the trends associated
   with human growth and institutional changes.}},

Abstract = {{In the analysis of water quality data, samples with concentrations
   reported below the limit of detection (LOD) are referred to as Type I
   censored on the left. A variety of procedures have been proposed for
   estimating descriptive statistics from left-censored data. Usually, the
   estimation is carried out by either replacing the LOD with a constant
   between 0 and the LOD, or assuming the data follow a normal or lognormal
   distribution. In this paper, a simple transformation is proposed to
   convert multiple left-censored water quality data to right-censored
   data. The transformed cumulative distribution is similar to a survival
   function, and enables use of survival analysis techniques for
   left-censored data. In particular, the product limit method
   (Kaplan-Meier estimator) is applied to estimate descriptive statistics
   from the transformed data. The performance of the Kaplan-Meier estimator
   is compared with maximum likelihood, probability plotting, and
   substitution methods by Monte Carlo simulations. The Kaplan-Meier
   estimator performs as well as or better than these more familiar
   methods. Finally, the Kaplan-Meier estimator is used to analyze some
   priority pollutant data collected in sediment from the central basin of
   Puget Sound.}},

Abstract = {{The cascade correlation neural network was used to predict the two-year
   peak discharge (Q(2)) for major regional river basins of the continental
   United States (US). Watersheds ranged in size by four orders of
   magnitude. Results of the neural network predictions ranged from
   correlations of 0.73 for 104 test data in the Souris-Red Rainy river
   basin to 0.95 for 141 test data in California. These results are
   improvements over previous multilinear regressions involving more
   variables that showed correlations ranging from 0.26 to 0.94. Results
   are presented for neural networks trained and tested on drainage area,
   average annual precipitation, and mean basin elevation. A neural network
   trained on regional scale data in the Texas Gulf was comparable to
   previous estimates of Q(2) by regression. Our research shows Q(2) was
   difficult to predict for the Souris-Red Rainy, Missouri, and Rio Grande
   river basins compared to the rest of the US, and acceptable predictions
   could be made using only mean basin elevation and drainage areas of
   watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{We measured annual discharges of water, sediments, and nutrients from 10
   watersheds with differing proportions of agricultural lands in the
   Piedmont physiographic province of the Chesapeake Bay drainage.
   Flow-weighted mean concentrations of total N, nitrate, and dissolved
   silicate in watershed discharges were correlated with the proportion of
   cropland in the watershed. In contrast, concentrations of P species did
   not correlate with cropland. Organic P and C correlated with the
   concentration of suspended particles, which differed among watersheds.
   Thus, the ratio of N:P:Si in discharges differed greatly among
   watersheds, potentially affecting N, P or Si limitation of phytoplankton
   growth in the receiving waters. Simple regression models of N discharge
   versus the percentage of cropland suggest that croplands discharge 29-42
   kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and other lands discharge 1.2-5.8 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1).
   We estimated net anthropogenic input of N to croplands and other lands
   using county level data on agriculture and N deposition from the
   atmosphere. For most of the study watersheds, N discharge amounted to
   less than half of the net anthropogenic N.}},

Abstract = {{The precision of width and pool area measurements has rarely been
   considered in relation to downstream or at section hydraulic geometry,
   fisheries studies, long-term or along a continuum research studies, or
   agency monitoring techniques. We assessed this precision and related it
   to other stream morphologic characteristics. Confidence limits (95
   percent) around mean estimates with four transects (cross-sections
   perpendicular to the channel centerline) ranged from +/- 0.4 to 1.8 m on
   streams with a width of only 2.2 m. To avoid autocorrelation, transects
   should be spaced about three channel widths apart. To avoid stochastic
   inhomogeneity, reach length should be about 30 channel widths or ten
   transects to optimize sampling efficiency. Precision of width
   measurements decreased with decreased depth and increased with stream
   size. Both observations reflect variability caused by features such as
   boulders or coarse woody debris. Pool area precision increased with pool
   area reflecting increased precision for flat, wide streams with regular
   pool-rime sequences. The least precision occurred on small, steep
   streams with random, boulder or coarse woody debris formed pools.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{The influence of sediment resuspension on the water quality of shallow
   labs is well documented. However, a search of the literature reveals no
   deterministic mass-balance eutrophication models that explicitly include
   resuspension. We modified the Lake Okeechobee water quality model -
   which uses the Water Analysis Simulation Package (WASP) to simulate
   algal dynamics and phosphorus, nitrogen, and oxygen cycles - to include
   inorganic suspended solids and algorithms that: (1) define changes in
   depth with changes in volume; (2) compute sediment resuspension based on
   bottom sheer stress; (3) compute partition coefficients for ammonia and
   ortho-phosphorus to solids; and (4) relate light attenuation to solids
   concentrations. The model calibration and validation were successful
   with the exception of dissolved inorganic nitrogen species which did not
   correspond well to observed data in the validation phase. This could be
   attributed to an inaccurate formulation of algal nitrogen preference
   and/or the absence of nitrogen fixation in the model. The model
   correctly predicted that the lake is light-limited from resuspended
   solids, and algae are primarily nitrogen limited. The model simulation
   suggested that biological fluxes greatly exceed external loads of

Abstract = {{Field studies were conducted to investigate the effects of tillage
   practices on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, and quantity and
   quality of surface runoff water resulting from the application of the
   liquid swine manure as a fertilizer. As part of the study, infiltration
   experiments were conducted on silt-loam soil with no-tillage (NT) and
   disk tillage (DT) practices. Liquid swine manure was applied on test
   plots, and the rainfall was applied by the portable rainfall simulator.
   The infiltration data was analyzed for the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K-6) and runoff volume determinations. The surface runoff
   water was analyzed for total N, total P, ammonia, and nitrate
   concentration determinations. The study indicated that the tillage had
   significant effects on K-6, and quantity and quality of runoff water.
   The K-6 values of the NT plots were found to vary from 0.693 to 1.734
   mm/min, with a mean of 1.494 mm/min, while they varied from 1.056 to
   2.543 mm/min, with a mean of 2.231 mm/min in the DT plots. The total N,
   total P, ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen concentrations were
   lower in runoff generated from DT plots, compared to that from the NT
   plots. The chemical concentration levels were significantly different in
   runoff waters collected one-day after manure application than in those
   collected 40-days after the manure application. Study suggested that the
   DT practice must be preferred over the NT practice if liquid swine
   manure is used as the fertilizer. The study is further continued to
   assess the long-term impacts of swine manure application and tillage on
   the quantity and quality of surface runoff water.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{689-703}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Natural rates of surface erosion on forested granitic soils in central
   Idaho were measured in 40 m(2) bordered erosion plots over a period of
   four years. In addition, we measured a variety of site variables, son
   properties, and summer rainstorm intensities in order to relate erosion
   rates to site attributes. Median winter erosion rates are approximately
   twice summer period rates, however mean summer rates are nearly twice
   winter rates because of infrequent high erosion caused by summer
   rainstorms. Regression equation models and regression tree models were
   constructed to explore relationships between erosion and factors that
   control erosion rates. Ground cover is the single factor that has the
   greatest influence on erosion rates during both summer and winter
   periods. Rainstorm intensity (erosivity index) strongly influences
   summer erosion rates, even on soils with high ground cover percentages.
   Few summer storms were of sufficient duration and intensity to cause
   rilling on the plots, and the data set was too small to elucidate
   differences in rib vs. interrill erosion. The regression tree models are
   relatively less biased than the regression equations developed, and
   explained 70 and 84 percent of the variability in summer and winter
   erosion rates, respectively.}},

   include epistemological comparisons, case studies, issue maps, and
   interactive simulations. Obstacles to the effective teaching of this
   subject include students' insufficient preparation and student disdain
   and cynicism. These obstacles may be mitigated by requiring a

   streambed sediments from 100 sites throughout New Jersey were examined
   to determine (1) which compounds were detected most frequently, (2)
   whether detection frequencies differed among selected drainage basins,
   and (3) whether concentrations differed significantly among selected
   drainage basins. Twelve drainage basins across New Jersey that contain a
   range of land-use patterns and population densities were selected to
   represent various types and degrees of development. To ensure an
   adequate number of samples for statistical comparison among drainage
   basins, the 12 selected basins were consolidated into seven drainage
   areas on the basis of similarities in land-use patterns and population
   densities. Additionally, data for three classes of chlorinated organic
   compounds in streambed sediments from 255 sites throughout New Jersey
   were examined to determine whether the presence of these compounds in
   streambed sediments is related to the type and degree of development
   within the drainage area of each sampling site.
   Chlorinated organic compounds detected most frequently within the seven
   representative drainage areas were DDT, DDE, DDD, chlordane, dieldrin,
   and PCBs. DDT, DDE, and DDD, which were the most widely distributed
   organic compounds, were detected in about 60 to 100 percent of the
   samples from all drainage areas but one (where the detection rate for
   these compounds was about 20 to 40 percent). Chlordane and dieldrin were
   detected in about 80 to 100 percent of samples from highly urbanized and
   populated drainage areas; detection frequencies for these compounds
   tended to be smaller in less developed and populated areas. PCBs were
   detected in about 40 to 85 percent of samples from all drainage areas;
   detection frequencies were highest in the most heavily developed and
   populated areas.
   Analysis of variance on rank-transformed organic compound concentrations
   normalized to sediment organic carbon content was used to evaluate
   differences in concentrations among the seven representative drainage
   areas. Chlordane and PCBs were the chlorinated organic compounds with
   the most highly elevated concentrations in streambed sediments across
   the State. Median normalized concentrations of all six of the most
   frequently detected chlorinated organic compounds were highest in the
   most heavily urbanized and populated drainage area and lowest in the
   less populated, predominantly agricultural or forested areas.
   Concentrations of DDT and DDE, however, did not differ significantly
   among most of the drainage areas. Concentrations of DDD, chlordane,
   dieldrin, and PCBs differed significantly among drainage areas. The
   highest median normalized concentrations were found in samples from the
   most heavily urbanized and populated areas, and the lowest were in
   samples from the least developed, most heavily forested area.
   Logistic regression was used to examine relations between the presence
   of hydrophobic chlorinated organic compounds in streambed sediments at
   specified concentrations and variables that characterize the type and
   degree of development within the drainage areas of 255 sites across New
   Jersey. The explanatory variables found most useful for predicting the
   presence of chlorinated organic compounds in streambed sediments include
   total population and amounts (in square kilometers) of various land-use
   categories. Logistic regression equations were developed to identify
   significant relations between population and amounts of specific
   land-use categories within drainage areas and the probability of
   detecting chlorinated organic contaminants in streambed sediments. These
   relations can be used to assist in the identification of geographic
   regions of primary concern for contamination of bed sediments by
   chlorinated organic compounds across the State.}},

Abstract = {{With the recent increased exploration and mining activity in the
   Northwest Territories, there has been growing interest in streamflows.
   However, streamflow monitoring in Canada's north is limited, especially
   in the central Northwest Territories where the exploration activity is
   concentrated. To complicate matters, the standard approach of measuring
   discharge with current meters or weirs is often inadequate or
   prohibitively expensive, as many streams in the region are shallow,
   braided and rocky. In response, alternative techniques such as salt
   dilution can be used. A salt tracer's competence in turbulent and rocky
   channels makes it ideal for discharge measurements in these situations.
   This paper summarizes the work performed by Indian and Northern Affairs
   Canada and Canamera Geological Ltd. staff in determining the stream
   discharge of a lake outlet using a potassium chloride (KCI) tracer. A
   variety of streamflow measurement methods were performed and compared to
   determine the viability and rigor of the dilution method. Results
   suggest the dilution method compares favorably to other measurement
   techniques both in accuracy and operational ease.}},

Abstract = {{Harland Creek, in east-central Mississippi, is a rapidly migrating,
   meandering stream that is experiencing severe bank erosion. More than
   9,000 willow (Salix nigra) posts were emplaced in February 1994 by the
   U.S. Army, Corps of Engineers in an effort to stabilize eroding stream
   banks using an experimental bioengineering technique. Monitoring of this
   stream reach and the willow post bank stabilization has resulted in a
   data base to assess willow mortality as related to bank aspect, post
   diameter, cover, and base elevation above low water. Monitoring has also
   resulted in the development of revised construction guidelines.
   Survivability of the posts, a necessary condition for long-term success,
   was found to average 81 percent in May 1994, 43 percent in October 1994,
   and 41 percent in August 1995. Even with survivability as low as 29
   percent to 34 percent at specific bend reaches, willow posts are
   documented to be successful in bank stabilization for the period of
   monitoring, in comparison with more traditional riprap stabilization
   methods. Guidelines for improved survivability and recommended site
   selection are presented. Cost of willow post bank stabilization is less
   than traditional riprap, and willow posts can be emplaced using readily
   available equipment and materials.}},

Abstract = {{Six years (1989-1994) of data from New Zealand's National Rivers Water
   Quality Network were used to characterize the optical water quality
   regime of river waters as regards: visual clarity (black disc
   visibility), turbidity, and light-absorbing aquatic humic material
   (referred to as `'yellow substance,'' measured as light absorption at
   440 mn). Quantitative relationships between optical water quality
   variables and flow in rivers are well-described by power law
   expressions. Visual clarity usually decreases strongly with increasing
   flow in individual rivers. There is a strong, inverse relationship
   between turbidity and visibility, but, because of differences between
   sites, turbidity is not a good general predictor of visual clarity (the
   attribute of real interest) in rivers. Yellow substance tends to
   increase with increasing flow, probably because during rainstorms, soil
   water high in yellow-colored humic material, rather than rain water or
   ground water, dominates discharge. Therefore, rivers are typically clear
   and low in humic matter at low flow, and turbid and yellow-colored at
   high flow.}},

Abstract = {{A simulation analysis of contaminated sediment transport involves model
   selection, data collection, model calibration and verification, and
   evaluation of uncertainty in the results. Sensitivity analyses provide
   information to address these issues at several stages of the
   investigation. A sensitivity analysis of simulated contaminated sediment
   transport is used to identify the most sensitive output variables and
   the parameters most responsible for the output variable sensitivity. The
   output variables included are streamflow and the flux of sediment and
   Cs-137. The sensitivities of these variables are measured at the field
   and intermediate scales, for flood and normal flow conditions, using the
   HSPF computer model. A sensitivity index was used to summarize and
   compare the results of a large number of output variables and
   parameters. An extensive database was developed to calibrate the model
   and conduct the sensitivity analysis on a 6.2 mi(2) catchment in eastern
   Tennessee. The fluxes of sediment and Cs-137 were more sensitive than
   streamflow to changes in parameters for both flood and normal flow
   conditions. The relative significance of specific parameters on output
   variable sensitivity varied according to the type of flow condition and
   the location in the catchment. An implications section illustrates how
   sensitivity analysis results can help with model selection, planning
   data collection, calibration, and uncertainty analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A significant portion of all pollutants entering surface waters
   (streams, lakes, estuaries, and wetlands) derives from nonpoint source
   (NPS) pollution and, in particular, agricultural activities. The first
   step in restoring a water resource is to focus on the primary water
   quality problem in the watershed. The most appropriate NPS control
   measures, which include best management practices (BMPs) and landscape
   features, such as wetlands and riparian areas, can then be selected and
   positioned to minimize or mitigate the identified pollutant(s). A
   computer-based decision support and educational software system,
   WATERSHEDSS (WATER, Soil, and Hydro-Environmental Decision Support
   System),has been developed to aid managers in defining their water
   quality problems and selecting appropriate NPS control measures. The
   three primary objectives of WATERSHEDSS are (1) to transfer water
   quality and land treatment information to watershed managers in order to
   assist them with appropriate land management/land treatment decisions;
   (2) to assess NPS pollution in a watershed based on user-supplied
   information and decisions; and (3) to evaluate, through geographical
   information systems-assisted modeling, the water quality effects of
   alternative land treatment scenarios.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Pages = {{343-357}},

Abstract = {{Water quality and trophic conditions in the Feitsui Reservoir, a
   subtropical reservoir, were evaluated with data from a ten-year data
   base to depict the impacts of river impoundment upon the chemical and
   biological characteristics of a reservoir, and to discuss the effects of
   flushing rate on in-lake phosphorus concentrations and phytoplankton
   growth. The results of the investigation showed that during the
   incipient impounding period, the water quality in the Feitsui Reservoir
   was significantly affected by internal loadings from submerged
   vegetation and soil in the flooded area. Studies of the changes in
   phosphorus compounds indicated that total phosphorus concentration
   appeared to approach equilibrium after the seventh year of impoundment
   and that orthophosphate stabilized after the sixth year of impoundment.
   Concentrations of both phosphorus forms varied seasonally after
   attaining stability. Nitrogen compounds (NH3-N, NO3-N and NO2-N)
   approached equilibrium within three years after impoundment. The
   seasonal variation in carbon was correlated to the number of
   phytoplankton. The mean value of the N:P mass ratio has remained over
   110 since year seven of impoundment (1990), indicating that phosphorus
   constitutes the potential limiting nutrient in the growth of
   phytoplankton. The rapid flushing rate (132.11 and 110.43 yr(-1)) in
   Feitsui Reservoir during the first and second impounding stages was a
   critical factor influencing the phytoplankton growth response to
   available nutrients.}},

Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Programs of monthly or annual stream water sampling will rarely observe
   the episodic extremes of acidification chemistry that occur during
   brief, unpredictable runoff events. When viewed in the context of data
   from several streams, however, baseflow measurements of variables such
   as acid neutralizing capacity, pH and NO3- are likely to be highly
   correlated with the episodic extremes of those variables from the same
   stream and runoff season. We illustrate these correlations for a water
   chemistry record, nearly two years in length, obtained from intensive
   sampling of 13 small Northeastern U.S. streams studied during USEPA's
   Episodic Response Project. For these streams, simple regression models
   estimate episodic extremes of acid neutralizing capacity, pH, NO3-,
   Ca2+, SO42-, and total dissolved Al with good relative accuracy from
   statistics of monthly or annual index samples. Model performances remain
   generally stable when episodic extremes in the second year of sampling
   are predicted from first-year models. Monthly or annual sampling
   designs, in conjunction with simple empirical models calibrated and
   maintained through intensive sampling every few years, may estimate
   episodic extremes of acidification chemistry with economy and reasonable
   accuracy. Such designs would facilitate sampling a large number of
   streams, thereby yielding estimates of the prevalence of episodic
   acidification at regional scales.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of trace elements in New Jersey streambed sediments is
   described with respect to physiographic provinces and major drainage
   areas. Samples were collected during 1976-1993 at 295 sites distributed
   throughout New Jersey. Copper, chromium, lead, and zinc were detected
   with the greatest frequency and at the highest concentrations of the
   elements. Concentrations of most trace elements were significantly
   higher in streambed sediments from the New England (glaciated) and
   Piedmont physiographic provinces - the provinces with the lowest and
   highest percentages of urban land use, respectively - than in sediments
   from the other provinces. High trace-element concentrations in the New
   England (glaciated) province reflect previous mining of extensive
   magnetite deposits, whereas those in the Piedmont province most likely
   reflect urban land use. Significantly lower trace-element concentrations
   in streambed sediments from the Coastal Plain are attributable to the
   low pH of the streamwater, the lack of iron and manganese available to
   form coatings that scavenge trace elements, and the relatively low
   percentage of urban land use in the province. Trace-element
   concentrations were related to land use, population, or point sources in
   the drainage basin specific to the sampling location by using logistic
   regression. Results of this analysis indicate a relation between arsenic
   and agricultural land use; chromium and physiographic province; and
   copper, lead, and zinc and population density.}},

Abstract = {{A two-year study was conducted to assess the effect of hog manure on the
   losses of nitrogen and phosphorus in runoff and drainage from grain-corn
   (Zea mays L.) plots, and the importance of spring versus annual loads.
   Treatments consisted of mineral N-P-K fertilizer applied at rates of 152
   kg N ha(-1), 35 kg P ha(-1), and 86 kg K ha(-1); and hog (Sus scrofa
   domestica L.) manure applied preplant or post-emergence (six-to-eight
   leaf stage), at 152 kg N ha, 39 kg P ha(-1) and 112 kg K ha(-1). The
   plots were rototilled (7 cm depth) in spring to incorporate fertilizer
   and preplant hog manure, and fall chisel-plowed (15 cm depth) to
   incorporate chopped corn residues. They were arranged in a completely
   randomized plot design. Flow volumes and nutrient levels in runoff and
   drainage waters were monitored year round but occurred mainly during the
   snowmelt (March 25-April 9), and post-snowmelt (April 10-May 13)
   periods. Of the total amount of water lost during snowmelt, 90 percent
   was in runoff, while 92 percent occurred as drainage in the
   post-snowmelt period. Sixty-five percent of the total annual volume of
   water lost was lost during these two periods as runoff and drainage.
   Treatments did not affect the annual snowmelt or post-snowmelt N and P
   loads. Total annual loads averaged 8.0 kg TKN ha(-1), 1.8 kg NH4-N
   ha(-1), 43 kg NO3-N ha(-1), 0.4 kg TP ha(-1), and 0.15 kg PO4-P ha(-1).
   Spring (snowmelt and post-snowmelt) runoff and drainage loads averaged
   2.9 kg TKN ha(-1), 1.2 kg NH4-N ha(-1), 18 kg NO3-N ha(-1), 0.25 kg TP
   ha(-1), and 0.04 kg PO4-P ha(-1), which were 40 percent to 70 percent of
   the yearly nutrient loads. Therefore, the hog manure management systems
   examined were of no greater threat to the environment than mineral
   fertilizers. However, spring N and P losses do represent an important
   part of the annual nutrient loss budget, even with conservation
   practices.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural practices such as cattle grazing and animal manure
   application can contribute to relatively high runoff concentrations of
   fecal coliform (FC) and fecal streptococcus (FS). Available information,
   however, is inconsistent with respect to the effects of such practices
   as well as to measures that can discriminate among candidate sources of
   FC and FS. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of
   grazing, time of year, and runoff amounts on FC and FS concentrations
   and to evaluate whether FC/FS concentration ratios are consistent with
   earlier values reported as characteristic of animal sources. Runoff from
   four Northwest Arkansas fields was sampled and analyzed for fecal
   coliform (FC) and fecal streptococcus (FS) for nearly three years
   (1991-1994). Each field was grazed and fertilized, with two fields
   receiving inorganic fertilizer and two receiving animal manure. Runoff
   amount had no effect on runoff concentrations of FC or FS. There were no
   consistent relationships between the presence of cattle and FC and FS
   runoff concentrations. Both FC and FS concentrations were affected by
   the season during which the runoff occurred. Higher concentrations were
   observed during warmer months. Runoff FC concentrations exceeded the
   primary contact standard of 200 cfu/100 mt during at least 89 percent of
   all runoff events and the secondary contact standard of 1000 cfu/100 mt
   during at least 70 percent of the events. Ratios of FC to FS
   concentrations varied widely (from near zero to more than 100),
   confirming earlier findings that FC/FS ratios are not a reliable
   indicator of the source of FC and FS.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of many fish populations within the mid-Appalachian region
   has been attributed to stream acidification as a result of acid
   precipitation. Many previous attempts to examine relationships between
   fish occurrence and acidification have been hindered by a lack of data
   on water quality and fish distributions. To assess relationships between
   water quality and bedrock type in the upper Cheat River drainage, we
   used EPA STORET water quality data (1969-1993) and calculated mean pH
   and mean alkalinity of streams associated with four bedrock types
   (Hampshire, Chemung, Mauch Chunk, and Pottsville). We examined the
   relationship between fish occurrence and bedrock type for 53 headwater
   streams. We found that acidity in headwater streams associated with
   Pottsville and Mauch Chunk groups often exceeded biological thresholds
   for acid-sensitive fish species (pH < 5.5). Streams associated with the
   Pottsville group typically had fewer cyprinid species and fewer total
   species than those associated with Mauch Chunk, Chemung, and Hampshire
   bedrock types. The congruent occurrence of streams with low buffering
   capacity, streams with pH < 5.5, and streams with low fish species
   richness indicate that acidification has influenced fish distributions
   in the upper Cheat River drainage.}},

   southern slopes of the Eastern Italian Alps with record length of 67-68
   years have been analyzed with the aim of verifying if their internal
   structure justifies the assumption of independence and identical

   consider the hypothesis H-0 of white noise as the intersection of
   several sub-hypotheses, each concerning one of the characteristics of a
   white noise process. To this end the nine series were subjected to
   various statistical tests regarding randomness, independence,
   change-points, and predictability. The results are examined first
   individually and then globally. They indicate that in eight of the nine
   considered time series the `'white noise hypothesis'' was rejected.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the potential to manage Mississippi River water
   levels for ecological benefits. The study focuses on the Weaver Bottoms,
   a 4,000 acre backwater marsh in southeastern Minnesota (Pool 5) highly
   valued for fish and wildlife habitat. The Weaver Bottoms has suffered
   increasing loss of aquatic vegetation and associated habitat degradation
   since the 1960s, largely due to persistent high water, sedimentation,
   wave re-suspension of sediments, and poor light penetration. In other
   reaches of the Mississippi River, water level reductions exposing
   backwater sediments have produced strong vegetative responses due to
   subaerial exposure of seeds and sediment compaction. Water level
   management scenarios for Pool 5 were developed using the HEC-2 water
   surface profile model. Results indicate that in many years it would be
   possible to reduce water levels sufficiently to expose much of the
   Weaver Bottoms, generating a substantial vegetative response. Additional
   benefits could be expected since both sediment compaction and increased
   vegetation would reduce re-suspension of sediments. Shifting management
   priorities to improve habitat would temporarily impact many river users,
   including both commercial and recreational boaters. Water level
   reductions must be coordinated with their needs.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology is used to identify
   candidate sites for a solid waste disposal facility in the Golbasi
   region of Turkey that has suffered from the negative impact of a current
   but poorly-located open-dump site on the environment. The municipality
   of Galbasi has noticed its deleterious effect on the environment, and
   has thus decided to dismiss this open-dump site and search for new
   landfill sites. In this study, the procedure followed under a GIS
   framework rejects the unacceptable sites considering environmental
   factors exclusively, other than economic and political issues, contained
   in the form of multiple layers of attribute information to select the
   candidate sites for landfilling wastes through an overlay analysis
   performed by GIS software, ARC/INFO V 7.1. For the spatial data
   requirements of GIS, a number of thematic map layers (ground water,
   wetlands and swamp areas, surface water, roads, topographic contours,
   ecological features, settlements, erosion susceptibility zones, and soil
   type) are prepared in digital form. In this application, GIS is
   considered as a screening tool in a site selection process to narrow the
   number of candidate sites, subsequently leading to one or more sites for
   detailed investigation. Preliminary ranking for a group of potential
   sites is done on the basis of simple calculations coupled with on-site
   field studies.}},

Abstract = {{The Black River, a tributary of the Chehalis River in western Washington
   State, has a history of widespread low dissolved oxygen (DO), anoxia in
   some locations, and fish kills. As part of a Total Maximum Daily Load
   (TMDL) study, environmental data were collected during two summer dry
   seasons and simulations were conducted with the WASP5 model to assess
   the effect of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia, and nutrient
   loads on DO in the Black River. DO levels were below the State water
   quality regulatory criterion of 8.0 mg/L in almost all locations during
   the study. The slow middle reach of the river showed stratified
   conditions, with anoxia in some of the deepest pools. Based on model
   simulations, DO was found to still fall below the 8.0 mg/L criterion in
   the entire mainstem under `'natural'' conditions, and eutrophication was
   identified as a potential problem in the middle reach. A TMDL was
   proposed for BOD and ammonia that would prevent significant degradation
   of DO in the Black River. To prevent eutrophic conditions in the Black
   River, a TMDL for total phosphorus was proposed that establishes a
   protective criterion of 0.05 mg/L for the middle river during the dry
   low-flow season.}},

Abstract = {{Following the Midwest flood of 1993, a study was initiated along a
   39-mile segment of the Missouri River to determine if there was an
   association between woody corridors and levee stability. A systematic
   sample of levee failures revealed that primary levees which did not fail
   had a significantly wider woody corridor than failed levees. Analysis of
   the total inventory of failed levees revealed that as the width of the
   woody corridor decreased, the length of the levee failure increased.
   Number of levee failures and their severity of damage could be reduced
   if woody corridors were at least 300 feet wide.}},

Abstract = {{A downspout diversion program in an urban area is evaluated to assess
   the impacts on sanitary sewer flow volumes and cost effectiveness.
   Sanitary sewer flows and wastewater treatment cost data are compared for
   the five years before and 1.25 years after the downspout diversion was
   completed. In order to establish a cause and effect relationship between
   flow volumes and downspout diversion, measurements of precipitation,
   consumption patterns, and system loss (maintenance, fire flows, main
   ruptures) for the before and after time periods were obtained. The
   results indicate the downspout diversion contributed to a reduction of
   over 25 percent in the mean flow volumes within the sanitary sewer
   collection network during all rainfall events, with flow reductions
   ranging from 25 percent to 62 percent for rainfall depths between 6 mm
   (0.25 inches) and 25.4 mm (1.0 inches). Costs incurred for wastewater
   treatment were also reduced significantly, as overtime for overflow
   maintenance was eliminated. Downspout diversion is a viable
   nonstructural alternative for stormwater flow reduction in highly
   urbanized communities which may lack available space for large scale
   detention facilities.}},

Abstract = {{The south Florida ecosystem and Lake Okeechobee are important water
   resource areas that have degraded due to changes in hydroperiod, water
   supply, and water quality. Approximately 56 percent of the total
   phosphorus in water discharged from the Everglades Agricultural Area
   (EAA) is in particulate form. Currently, farm-level best management
   practices are being implemented in the effort to reduce total phosphorus
   and sediment in off-farm discharges. The objective of this work was to
   develop and calibrate a model describing water movement in primary EAA
   canals as a first step to development of a water quality (i.e.,
   nutrient, sediment) model. The Netherlands-developed mechanistic flow
   and water quality model (DUFLOW) was adapted for the EAA. Flow, stage,
   geometry, canal network, and meteorological data, October 13, 1993, to
   February 13, 1994, were used to adapt and calibrate the DUFLOW model for
   EAA water level and flow in primary canals. Direct runoff discharge into
   the primary canals from farm-pump stations was used as runoff input for
   the model. The model results are comparable to an
   independently-calculated water balance for the EAA. The calibrated flow
   model will be the basis for the calibration of sediment and chemical
   transport in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial changes in abiotic and biotic variables from riverine to
   lacustrine areas characterized by the river-lake concept of reservoir
   function was applied to the Tomhannock Reservoir, Rensselaer County, New
   York. To identify these longitudinal gradients, a two-year investigation
   (May 1991 to October 1992) was conducted to measure primary
   productivity, nutrient concentrations, chlorophyll a and phytoplankton
   biomass at three locations in the 705-ha water supply reservoir.
   Emphasis was placed on the measurement of primary production using the
   carbon-14 artificial incubator (photosynthetron) technique. The average
   annual production in 1992 was 247.3 g m(-2) 245 d(-1) ranging from 52 to
   2677 mg C m(-2). Mean alpha(B) (assimilation efficiency), P(B)m
   (assimilation number), and I-k (saturation irradiance) were 4.40 mg C
   mgChl(-1) E-1 m(-2), 3.82 mg C mgChl(-1) h(-1), and 236.5 mu E m(2)
   s(-1), respectively. Neither seasonal nor spatial variability of these
   photosynethetic parameters were observed. Except for Secchi depth,
   distinct longitudinal zones from river inflow to dam were not
   statistically demonstrated in the Tomhannock Reservoir. Mean extinction
   coefficient, chlorophyll a and total phosphorus concentrations
   decreased; Secchi transparency and phytoplankton biomass increased;
   while primary productivity and dissolved inorganic nitrogen
   concentration remained the same from headwater to dam. These baseline
   data will be used to assess the future effectiveness of best management
   practices (BMPs) recently instituted on selected watershed farmland in
   an attempt to reduce the detrimental impact of agricultural activities
   on drinking water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Overlapping and adjacent ground water investigations are common in areas
   where aquifers are threatened by industrial development. In the
   Indianapolis area in Marion County, Indiana, a patchwork of ground water
   flow models have been used during the past 20 years to evaluate ground
   water resources and to determine the effects of local contamination. In
   every case these ground water models were constructed from scratch.
   Site specific finite difference grids or finite element meshes inhibit
   the direct reuse of input data when the area of interest shifts. Because
   the aquifer is not discretized into a grid or mesh with analytic element
   models, there are unique opportunities for direct reuse of model input
   data. In two applications of this principle we illustrate how the newly
   emerging analytic element method allows a fairly straightforward reuse
   of model input data from previous models in the same general area. In
   analytic element models of Central Indiana, streams and their
   tributaries are represented in different resolutions. Input data items
   of several modeling studies are stored and cataloged on disk in such a
   manner that they can be selectively retrieved by a data management
   program PREPRO. In this manner, a new ground water model can be set up
   quickly with input data which have been previously defined and tested
   during model calibration.}},

Abstract = {{The implications of Lake Ontario regulation under transposed climates
   with changed means and variability are presented for seasonal and annual
   time scales. The current regulation plan is evaluated with climates
   other than the climate for which it was developed and tested. This
   provides insight into potential conflicts and management issues,
   development of regulation criteria for extreme conditions, and potential
   modification of the regulation plan. Transposed climates from the
   southeastern and south central continental United States are applied to
   thermodynamic models of the Great Lakes and hydrologic models of their
   watersheds; these climates provide four alternative scenarios of water
   supplies to Lake Ontario. The scenarios are analyzed with reference to
   the present Great Lakes climate. The responses of the Lake Ontario
   regulation plan to the transposed climate scenarios illustrate several
   key issues: (1) historical water supplies should no longer be the sole
   basis for testing and developing lake regulation plans; (2) during
   extreme supply conditions, none of the regulation criteria can be met
   simultaneously, priority of interests may change, and new interests may
   need to be considered, potentially requiring substantial revision to the
   Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909; (3) revised regulation criteria should
   be based on ecosystem health and socio-economic benefits for a wider
   spectrum of interests and not on frequencies and ranges of levels and
   flows of the historical climate; and (4) operational management of the
   lake should be improved under the present climate, and under any future
   climate with more variability, through the use of improved water supply
   forecasts and monitoring of current hydrologic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The pebble count procedure (Wolman, 1954) is the measurement of 100
   randomly selected stones from a homogeneous population on a river bed or
   bar, which yields reproducible size distribution curves for surficial
   deposits of gravel and cobbles. The pebble count is widely used in
   geomorphology (and increasingly in river engineering) to characterize
   surficial grain size distributions in lieu of bulk samples, for which
   adequate sample sizes become enormous for gravels. Variants on the
   original method have been proposed, one of which, the so-called
   `zig-zag' method (Bevenger and King, 1995), involves sampling along a
   diagonal line and drawing data points from many different geomorphic
   units. The method is not reproducible, probably because it incorporates
   stones from many different populations, and because an inadequate number
   of grains is sampled from any given population. Sampling of coarse bed
   material should be geomorphically stratified based on the natural
   sorting of grain sizes into distinct channel features. If a composite
   grain size is desired, the areas of the bed occupied by different
   populations can be mapped, pebble counts conducted on each, and a
   weighted average distribution computed.}},

Abstract = {{The infiltration of atrazine, deethylatrazine, and deisopropylatrazine
   from Walnut Creek, a tributary stream, to the alluvial valley aquifer
   along the South Skunk River in central Iowa occurred where the stream
   transects the river's flood plain. A preliminary estimate indicated that
   the infiltration was significant and warrants further investigation.
   Infiltration was estimated by measuring the loss of stream discharge in
   Walnut Creek and the concentrations of atrazine and its metabolites
   deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine, in ground water 1 m beneath the
   streambed. Infiltration was estimated before application of
   agrichemicals to the fields during a dry period on April 7, 1994, and
   after application of agrichemicals during a period of small runoff on
   June 8, 1994. On April 7, the flux of atrazine, deethylatrazine, and
   deisopropylatrazine from Walnut Creek into the alluvial valley aquifer
   ranged from less than 10 to 60 (mu g/d)m(2), whereas on June 8 an
   increased flux ranged from 270 to 3060 (mu g/d)/m(2). By way of
   comparison, the calculated fluxes of atrazine beneath Walnut Creek, for
   these two dates, were two to five orders of magnitude greater than an
   estimated flux of atrazine to ground water caused by leaching from a
   field on a per-unit-area basis. Furthermore, the unit-area flux rates of
   water from Walnut Creek to the alluvial valley aquifer were about three
   orders of magnitude greater than estimated recharge to the alluvial
   aquifer from precipitation. The large flux of chemicals from Walnut
   Creek to the alluvial valley aquifer was due in part to the conductive
   streambed and rather fast ground water velocities; average vertical
   hydraulic conductivity through the streambed was calculated as 35 and 90
   m/d for the two sampling dates, and estimated ground water velocities
   ranged from 1 to 5 m/d.}},

Abstract = {{In areas where water is scarce, drip irrigation provides the most
   efficient way to conserve irrigation water, but its cost of \$1000 an
   acre is prohibitive for most small farmers in developing countries. The
   cost was reduced by 90 percent by (1) making dripper lines moveable, so
   that each line reaches ten rows instead of one; (2) replacing 25-cent
   emitters with simple 0.70 mm holes punched by a heated needle; and (3)
   using \$3.00 off-the-shelf 20 liter containers with cloth filters in
   place of expensive filter systems. This reduced the cost of a half-acre
   system to \$50. The low cost system was field tested in the hill areas
   of Nepal, and in mulberry cultivation in Andhra Pradesh, India.
   Uniformity of flow from emitters was 73-84 percent. Small farmers
   reported that the low cost trickle irrigation system cut labor
   requirements in half, and doubled the area irrigated by the same amount
   of water. The low cost drip system is likely to be widely adopted by
   small farmers in semi-arid and hilly regions.}},

Abstract = {{Linear programming is applied to identify the least cost strategy for
   reaching politically specified phosphorus and total suspended solids
   reduction targets for the Fox-Wolf river basin in Northeast Wisconsin.
   The programming model uses data collected on annualized unit reduction
   costs associated with five categories of sources of phosphorus and total
   suspended solids discharge in each of the 41 subwatersheds in the basin
   to determine the least cost management strategy. Results indicate that:
   (1) cost-effective nutrient reduction requires careful selection of
   geographic areas and source categories to address throughout the
   watershed; (2) agricultural sources are the most cost-effective to
   address in the basin; and (3) care should be exercised in setting
   nutrient reduction targets, given that there are likely to be
   significantly increasing marginal costs of nutrient reduction; the model
   predicts that lowering the most restrictive target by 33 percent would
   cut reduction expenditures by about 75 percent. Policy implications of
   the model include support for the investigation and potential
   development of institutional arrangements that enable cost-effective
   nutrient reduction activities to occur, such as the creation of an
   agency with authority over a given watershed, coordinated watershed
   management activities, or nutrient trading programs.}},

Abstract = {{A complex watershed-scale water quality simulation model, the
   Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF) model, was calibrated for
   a 16 km(2) catchment. The simulation step size was 0.33 hours with
   predicted and recorded hydrologic flows compared on an annual and
   monthly basis during a total calibration period of four years. Unguided
   numerical optimization when applied alone did not yield a model
   parameter set with acceptable predictive capability; instead, it was
   necessary to apply a critical process that included sensitivity
   analysis, numerical optimization, and testing of derived model parameter
   sets to evaluate their performance for periods other than those for
   which they were determined. Using this critical calibration process, the
   model was proven to have significant predictive capability Numerical
   optimization is an aid for model calibration, but it must not be used
   blindly.}},

Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands have recently gained popularity as an alternative
   method for wastewater treatment. This paper compares two design
   methodologies currently used for constructed wetlands; Tennessee Valley
   Authority (TVA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods. A
   discussion of parameters for both methods is given and a wetland
   treatment system is designed for an individual residence with typical
   BOD5 loads and flow rates.
   Calculation results revealed significant discrepancies in the required
   constructed wetlands volume, and thus detention time, stemming from
   inherent differences in the design methodologies. The EPA method relies
   heavily on plug flow kinetics, and is therefore sensitive to changes in
   the reaction rate constant and media porosity. Conversely, TVA
   determines the surface area by sizing in accordance with a recommended
   hydraulic loading criterion and is affected only by the hydraulic flow
   rates. This study concluded that a constructed wetland is a viable
   option under design considerations that are not favorable for
   traditional on-site wastewater treatment methods. However, it is
   recommended that conservative values for flow and loading rates be
   assumed to assure complete treatment for either of the design methods.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of the Comstock Lode in western Nevada in 1859 initiated
   the use of liquid mercury (Hg) or `'quicksilver'' to remove gold (Au)
   and silver (Ag) from crushed ore. Today, Hg is present in historic mill
   tailings piles, in alluvial deposits adjacent to the Carson River, and
   in Lahontan Reservoir. Mercury concentrations in Carson River water have
   been reported as high as 61 mu g/L by the U.S. Geological Survey. Fish
   from Lahontan Reservoir have methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations as much
   as four times the 1.0 mu g/g limit for human consumption. Since more
   than 95 percent of total Hg in water can be associated with
   particulates, the transport of sediment must be quantified to understand
   the fate of Hg in the system. By linking the RIVMOD hydrodynamic model
   with the WASP5 water quality model, and using suspended sediment rating
   curves along with bedload transport equations, reliable predictions of
   sediment transport can be made. Measured suspended sediment data from
   the Carson River, and an estimate of annual sediment loading to Lahontan
   Reservoir, were used to create a calibrated sediment transport model.
   Model simulations predicted the long term transport of sediment into
   Lahontan Reservoir, the transport of sediment into Lahontan Reservoir
   during a flood year (1986 water year), and concentrations of total Hg in
   the Carson River using an estimate of sediment Hg concentrations. This
   research will eventually be used with an Hg model to predict the fate of
   Hg in the river and reservoir system.}},

Abstract = {{Although they have not been the focus of major regulations, small
   businesses can contribute pollutants to ground water through routine
   practices. Because strict regulation of millions of micro firms is not
   likely, water resource professionals face a challenge of how to reach
   small business operators with effective pollution prevention messages.
   The purpose of this study was to examine the factors that influence a
   small business operator to adopt measures that reduce potential ground
   water pollution. We looked at how information delivery, internal
   business characteristics, and external relationships are associated with
   voluntary preventive measures. Mail surveys from small businesses in New
   Jersey municipalities and interviews with business owners provided data
   about business characteristics and current pollution prevention
   activities. Findings suggested that businesses doing the most to prevent
   ground water pollution were generally more connected to external
   organizations and had more financial and technical resources. The study
   also discovered that small business owners fear government involvement
   in their affairs. The study concludes with recommendations to encourage
   more voluntary adoption of prevention measures by businesses. These
   center on separating assistance programs from enforcement and involving
   industry peer groups in an effort to make information available in a
   non-threatening manner.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate data about nutrient concentrations in wastewater treatment
   plant effluents are needed for river basin water-quality studies. As
   part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment
   Program in the South Platte River Basin, nutrient data were requested
   from 31 wastewater-treatment plants located in the basin. This article
   describes the types of nutrient data available from the plants, examines
   the variability of effluent nutrient concentrations, and discusses
   methods for estimation of nutrient concentrations where data are
   lacking.
   Ammonia was monitored at 88 percent of the plants, nitrite plus nitrate
   was monitored at 40 percent of the plants, and organic nitrogen and
   phosphorus were monitored at less than 25 percent of the plants. Median
   total nitrogen concentrations and median total phosphorus concentrations
   were small compared to typical literature estimates for
   wastewater-treatment plants with secondary treatment. Nutrient
   concentrations in effluent from wastewater-treatment plants varied
   widely between and within plants. For example, ammonia concentrations
   varied as much as 5 mg/L during a day, as much as 10 mg/L from day to
   day, and as much as 30 mg/L from summer to winter within a plant. In the
   South Platte River Basin, estimates of median annual ammonia and nitrite
   plus nitrate concentrations can be improved based on plant processes;
   and nitrite plus nitrate and organic nitrogen concentrations can be
   estimated based on ammonia concentrations. However, to avoid large
   estimation errors, more complete nutrient data from wastewater-treatment
   plants are needed for integration into river basin water quality
   studies. The paucity of data hinders attempts to evaluate the relative
   importance of point source and nonpoint source nutrient loadings to
   rivers.}},
