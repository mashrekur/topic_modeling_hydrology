Abstract = {{The Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology is
   used to investigate how distributed water table observations modify
   simulation and parameter uncertainty for the hydrological model
   TOPMODEL, applied to the Saeternbekken Minifelt catchment in Norway.
   Errors in simulating observed flows, continuously-logged borehole water
   levels and more extensive, spatially distributed water table depths are
   combined using Bayes' equation within a `likelihood measure' L. It is
   shown how the distributions of L for the TOPMODEL parameters change as
   the different types of observed data are considered. These distributions
   are also used to construct corresponding simulation uncertainty bounds
   for flows, borehole water levels, and water table depths within the
   spatially-extensive piezometer network. Qualitatively wide uncertainty
   bounds for water table simulations are thought to be consistent with the
   simplified nature of the distributed model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The equation describing the ensemble-average solute concentration in a
   heterogeneous porous media can be developed from the Lagrangian
   (stochastic-convective) approach and from a method that uses a
   renormalized cumulant expansion. These two approaches are compared for
   the case of steady flow, and it is shown that they are related. The
   cumulant expansion approach can be interpreted as a series expansion of
   the convolution path integral that defines the ensemble-average
   concentration in the La,Lagrangian approach. The two methods can be used
   independently to develop the classical form for the
   convection-dispersion equation, and are shown to lead to identical
   transport equations under certain simplifying assumptions. In the
   development of such transport equations, the cumulant expansion does not
   require a priori the assumption of any particular distribution for the
   Lagrangian displacements or velocity field, and does not require one to
   approximate trajectories with their ensemble-average. In order to obtain
   a second-order equation, the cumulant expansion method does require
   truncation of a series, but this truncation is done rationally by the
   development of a constraint in terms of parameters of the transport
   field. This constraint is less demanding than requiring that the
   distribution for the Lagrangian displacements be strictly Gaussian, and
   it indicates under what velocity field conditions a second-order
   transport equation is a reasonable approximation. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Monte-Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional finite element model of a
   flood in the southern paa of Sicily were used to explore the parameter
   space of distributed bed-roughness coefficients. For many real-world
   events specific data are extremely limited so that there is not only
   fuzziness in the information available to calibrate the model, but
   fuzziness in the degree of acceptability of model predictions based upon
   the different parameter values, owing to model structural errors. Here
   the GLUE procedure is used to compare model predictions and observations
   for a certain event, coupled with both a fuzzy-rule-based calibration,
   and a calibration technique based upon normal and heteroscedastic
   distributions of the predicted residuals. The fuzzy-rule-based
   calibration is suited to an event of this kind, where the information
   about the flood is highly uncertain and arises from several different
   types of observation. The likelihood (relative possibility)
   distributions predicted by the two calibration techniques are similar,
   although the fuzzy approach enabled us to constrain the parameter
   distributions more usefully, to lie within a range which was consistent
   with the modellers' a priori knowledge of the system. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The basic aim of this paper is to formulate rigorous conservation
   equations for mass, momentum, energy and entropy for a watershed
   organized around the channel network. The approach adopted is based on
   the subdivision of the whole watershed into smaller discrete units,
   called representative elementary watersheds (REW), and the formulation
   of conservation equations for these REWs. The REW as a spatial domain is
   divided into five different subregions: (1) unsaturated zone; (2)
   saturated zone; (3) concentrated overland how; (4) saturated overland
   flow; and (5) channel reach. These subregions all occupy separate
   volumina. Within the REW, the subregions interact with each other, with
   the atmosphere on top and with the groundwater or impermeable strata at
   the bottom, and are characterized by typical flow time scales.
   The balance equations are derived for water, solid and air phases in the
   unsaturated zone, water and solid phases in the saturated zone and only
   the waterphase in the two overland flow zones and the channel. In this
   way REW-scale balance equations, and respective exchange terms for mass,
   momentum, energy and entropy between neighbouring subregions and phases,
   are obtained Averaging of the balance equations over time allows to keep
   the theory general such that the hydrologic system can be studied over a
   range of time scales. Finally, the entropy inequality for the entire
   watershed as an ensemble of subregions is derived as constraint-type
   relationship for the development of constitutive relationships, which
   are necessary for the closure of the problem. The exploitation of the
   second law and the derivation of constitutive equations for specific
   types of watersheds will be the subject of a subsequent paper. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Linear instability and nonlinear energy stability analyses are developed
   for the problem of a fluid-saturated porous layer stratified by
   penetrative thermal convection and two salt concentrations. Unusual
   neutral curves are obtained, in particular non-perfect `heart-shaped'
   oscillatory curves that are disconnected from the stationary neutral
   curve. These curves show that three critical values of the thermal
   Rayleigh number may be required to fully describe the linear stability
   criteria. As the penetrative effect is increased, the oscillatory curves
   depart more and more from a perfect heart shape. For certain values of
   the parameters it is shown that the minima on the oscillatory and
   stationary curves occur at the same Rayleigh number but different
   wavenumbers, offering the prospect of different types of instability
   occurring simultaneously at different wavenumbers. A weighted energy
   method is used to investigate the nonlinear stability of the problem and
   yields unconditional results guaranteeing nonlinear stability for
   initial perturbations of arbitrary sized amplitude. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Highly resolved simulations of groundwater flow, chemical migration and
   contaminant recovery processes are used to test the applicability of
   stochastic models of flow and transport in a typical field setting. A
   simulation domain encompassing a portion of the upper saturated aquifer
   materials beneath the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was
   developed to hierarchically represent known hydrostratigraphic units and
   more detailed stochastic representations of geologic heterogeneity
   within them. Within each unit, Gaussian random field models were used to
   represent hydraulic conductivity variation, as parameterized from well
   test data and geologic interpretation of spatial variability.
   Groundwater flow, transport and remedial extraction of two hypothetical
   contaminants were made in six different statistical realizations of the
   system. The effective flow and transport behavior observed in the
   simulations compared reasonably with the predictions of stochastic
   theories based upon the Gaussian models, even though more exacting
   comparisons were prevented by inherent nonidealities of the geologic
   model and how system. More importantly, however, biases and limitations
   in the hydraulic data appear to have reduced the applicability of the
   Gaussian representations and clouded the utility of the simulations and
   effective behavior based upon them. This suggests a need for better and
   unbiased methods for delineating the spatial distribution and structure
   of geologic materials and hydraulic properties in field systems. High
   performance computing can be of critical importance in these endeavors,
   especially with respect to resolving transport processes within highly
   variable media. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional numerical simulations using a detailed synthetic
   hydraulic conductivity field developed from geological considerations
   provide insight into the scaling of subsurface flow and transport
   processes. Flow and advective transport in the highly resolved
   heterogeneous field were modeled using massively parallel computers,
   providing a realistic baseline for evaluation of the impacts of
   parameter scaling. Upscaling of hydraulic conductivity was performed at
   a variety of scales using a flexible power law averaging technique. A
   series of tests were performed to determine the effects of varying the
   scaling exponent on a number of metrics of flow and transport behavior.
   Flow and transport simulation on high-performance computers and
   three-dimensional scientific visualization combine to form a powerful
   tool for gaining insight into the behavior of complex heterogeneous
   systems.
   Many quantitative groundwater models utilize upscaled hydraulic
   conductivity parameters, either implicitly or explicitly. These
   parameters are designed to reproduce the bulk flow characteristics at
   the grid or field scale while not requiring detailed quantification of
   local-scale conductivity variations. An example from applied groundwater
   modeling is the common practice of calibrating grid-scale model
   hydraulic conductivity or transmissivity parameters so as to approximate
   observed hydraulic head and boundary flux values. Such
   parameterizations, perhaps with a bulk dispersivity imposed, are then
   sometimes used to predict transport of reactive or nonreactive solutes.
   However, this work demonstrates that those parameters that lead to the
   best upscaling for hydraulic conductivity and head do not necessarily
   correspond to the best upscaling for prediction of a variety of
   transport behaviors. This result reflects the fact that transport is
   strongly impacted by the existence and connectedness of extreme-valued
   hydraulic conductivities, in contrast to bulk flow which depends more
   strongly on mean values. It provides motivation for continued research
   into upscaling methods for transport that directly address advection in
   heterogeneous porous media.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we examine the behavior of internal Kelvin waves on
   anf-plane in finite-difference models using the Arakawa C-grid. The
   dependence of Kelvin wave phase speed on offshore grid resolution and
   propagation direction relative to the numerical grid is illustrated by
   numerical experiments for three different geometries: (1) Kelvin wave
   propagating along a straight coastline; (2) Kelvin wave propagating at a
   45 degrees angle to the numerical grid along a stairstep coastline with
   stairstep size equal to the grid spacing; (3) Kelvin wave propagating at
   a 45 degrees angle to the numerical grid along a coarse resolution
   stairstep coastline with stairstep size greater than the grid spacing.
   It can be shown theoretically that the phase speed of a Kelvin wave
   propagating along a straight coastline on an Arakawa C-grid is equal to
   the analytical inviscid wave speed and is not dependent on offshore grid
   resolution. However, we found that finite-difference models considerably
   underestimate the Kelvin wave phase speed when the wave is propagating
   at an angle to the grid and the grid spacing is comparable with the
   Rossby deformation radius. In this case, the phase speed converges
   toward the correct value only as grid spacing decreases well below the
   Rossby radius. A grid spacing of one-fifth the Rossby radius was
   required to produce results for the stairstep boundary case comparable
   with the straight coast case. This effect does not appear to depend on
   the resolution of the coastline, but rather on the direction of wave
   propagation relative to the grid. This behavior is important for
   modeling internal Kelvin waves in realistic geometries where the Rossby
   radius is often comparable with the grid spacing, and the waves
   propagate along irregular coastlines. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The dusty gas model constitutive relationships were incorporated into a
   numerical model for three-phase, multicomponent flow and transport in
   porous media. The dusty sas model properly accounts for interactions
   between all gas-phase species in multicomponent gas mixtures. The model
   also included Knudsen diffusion, which becomes important in very fine
   grained soils. The dusty gas model results were compared to predictions
   based on Fick's law. For the cases studied, Fick's law overpredicted
   flux rates of organic compounds, the effect becoming more pronounced as
   the permeability of the soil and the Knudsen coefficient were reduced.
   Increasing moisture content also appeared to increase the difference
   between predictions based on the dusty gas model and those based on
   Fick's law. Hypothetical field-scale simulations were performed to show
   the impact of multicomponent effects and Knudsen diffusion in a sandy
   soil and in a clay soil. Results showed that remediation times were
   significantly underpredicted if Fick's law was used for gas-phase

Abstract = {{This work presents a rigorous numerical validation of analytical
   stochastic models of steady state unsaturated flow in heterogeneous
   porous media. It also provides a crucial link between stochastic theory
   based on simplifying assumptions and empirical field and simulation
   evidence of variably saturated flow in actual or realistic hypothetical
   heterogeneous porous media. Statistical properties of unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity, soil water tension, and soil water flux in
   heterogeneous soils are investigated through high resolution Monte Carlo
   simulations of a wide range of steady state flow problems in a
   quasi-unbounded domain. In agreement with assumptions in analytical
   stochastic models of unsaturated flow, hydraulic conductivity and soil
   water tension are found to be lognormally and normally distributed,
   respectively. In contrast, simulations indicate that in moderate to
   strong variable conductivity fields, longitudinal flux is highly skewed.
   Transverse flux distributions are leptokurtic. the moments of the
   probability distributions obtained from Monte Carlo simulations are
   compared to modified first-order analytical models. Under moderate to
   strong heterogeneous soil flux conditions (sigma(y)(2)greater than or
   equal to 1), analytical solutions overestimate variability in soil water
   tension by up to 40\% as soil heterogeneity increases, and underestimate
   variability of both flux components by up to a factor 5. Theoretically
   predicted model (cross-)covariance agree well with the numerical sample
   (cross-)covarianaces. Statistical moments are shown to be consistent
   with observed physical characteristics of unsaturated flow in
   heterogeneous soils. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights

Abstract = {{A series of multi-step outflow experiments was carried out to identify
   the unsaturated hydraulic properties of two homogeneous coarse-textured
   porous media (glass beads and sand). Because of the measured sharp
   fronts of water content decrease during these experiments the hydraulic
   functions are assumed to be represented by the complete van
   Genuchten-Mualem closed-form expressions with variable coefficients
   alpha, n, m and theta(r). The values of theta(s) and K-s were measured
   directly. A sensitivity analysis with respect to alpha, n, and m shows
   that conditions of local identifiability are satisfied if measurements
   of water content at some inner points inside the column are considered.
   The inverse modelling technique consists of two steps: first,
   computation of objective function values based on water content data
   responses to obtain initial parameter estimations, and second, a more
   detailed parameter determination using a Levenberg-Marquardt scheme. In
   both steps a numerical model incorporating the hydraulic functions is
   utilized to simulate theoretical pressure head and water content
   distributions along the column. For both porous media unique solutions
   of the inverse problem could be obtained, and afterwards, the
   corresponding hydraulic functions were verified from additional drainage
   experiments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we analyze a model for brine transport in porous media,
   which includes a mass balance for the fluid, a mass balance for salt,
   Darcy's law and an equation of state, which relates the fluid density to
   the salt mass fraction. This model incorporates the effect of local
   volume changes due to variations in the salt concentration. Density
   variations affect the compressibility of the fluid, which in turn cause
   additional fluid Bow. Two specific situations are investigated that lead
   to self-similarity. We study the relative importance of the
   compressibility effect in terms of the relative density difference.
   Semi-analytical solutions are obtained as well as asymptotic expressions
   in terms of the relative density difference. It is found that the volume
   changes have a small but noticeable effect on the mass transport only
   when the salt concentration gradients are large. Some results on the
   simultaneous transport of brine and dissolved (radioactive) tracers are
   presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a one-dimensional model biodegradation system consisting of
   two reaction-advection equations for nutrient and pollutant
   concentrations and a rate equation for biomass. The hydrodynamic
   dispersion is ignored. Under an explicit condition on the decay and
   growth rates of biomass, the system can be approximated by two component
   models by setting biomass kinetics to equilibrium. We derive closed form
   solutions for constant speed traveling fronts for the reduced two
   component models and compare their profiles in homogeneous media. For a
   spatially random velocity field, we introduce travel time and study
   statistics of degradation fronts via representations in terms of the
   travel time probability density function (pdf) and the traveling front
   profiles. The travel time pdf does not vary with the nutrient and
   pollutant concentrations and only depends on the random water velocity.
   The traveling front profiles are expressed analytically or
   semi-analytically as functions of the travel time. The problem of
   nonlinear transport by a random velocity reduces to two subproblems: one
   being nonlinear transport by a known (unit) velocity, and the other
   being linear (advective) transport by a random velocity. The approach is
   illustrated through some examples where the randomness in velocity stems
   from the spatial variability of porosity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The migration and entrapment of dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs)
   in aquifer formations is typically believed to be controlled by physical
   heterogeneities. This belief is based upon the assumption that
   permeability and capillary properties are determined by the soil
   texture. Capillarity and relative permeability, however, will also
   depend on porous medium wettability characteristics. This wettability
   may vary spatially in a formation due to variations in aqueous phase
   chemistry, contaminant aging, and/or variations in mineralogy and
   organic matter distributions. In this work, a two-dimensional multiphase
   flow simulator is modified to simulate coupled physical and chemical
   formation heterogeneity. To model physical heterogeneity, a spatially
   correlated permeability field is generated, and then related to the
   capillary pressure-saturation function according to Leverett scaling.
   Spatial variability of porous medium wettability is assumed to be
   correlated with the natural logarithm of the intrinsic permeability. The
   influence of wettability on the hysteretic hydraulic property relations
   is also modeled. The simulator is then employed to investigate the
   potential influence of coupled physical and chemical heterogeneity on
   DNAPL flow and entrapment. For reasonable ranges of wettability
   characteristics, simulations demonstrate that spatial variations in
   wettability can have a dramatic impact on DNAPL distributions. Higher
   organic saturations, increased lateral spreading, and decreased depth of
   infiltration were predicted when the contact angle was varied spatially.
   When chemical heterogeneity was defined by spatial variation of
   organic-wet solid fractions (fractional wettability porous media),
   however, the resultant organic saturation distributions were more
   similar to those for perfectly water-wet media, due to saturation
   dependent wettability effects on the hydraulic property relations. (C)

Abstract = {{In modeling shocks in open channel flows, the traditional finite
   difference schemes become inefficient and warrant special numerical
   treatment for smooth computations. This paper provides a general
   introduction to the non-oscillatory high-resolution methodology, coupled
   with the advantages of using these conservative methods for open channel
   applications. Results of the numerical experiments are presented and
   compared to standard algorithm results, analytical solutions and
   experimental results to demonstrate the robustness of the
   high-resolution formulation. Finally results of flows with mixed flow
   conditions (as in hydraulic jump), indicate that the contribution of the
   Boussinesq pressure term is minimal. Besides showing robustness in
   capturing shocks in open channel, the results indicate that the effect
   of the grid spacing on the shock resolution is small. However, for jumps
   with high Froude numbers, the present formulation slightly
   underestimates the peak depth. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{Artificial neural network (ANN) is considered to be a powerful tool for
   solving groundwater problems which require a large number of flow and
   contaminant transport (GFCT) simulations. Often, GFCT models are
   nonlinear, and they are difficult to solve using traditional numerical
   methods to simulate specific input-output responses. In order to avoid
   these difficulties, ANN may be used to simulate the GFCT responses
   explicitly. In this manuscript, recent research related to the
   application of ANN in simulating GFCT responses is critically reviewed,
   and six research areas are identified. In order to study these areas, a
   one-dimensional unsaturated flow and transport scenario was developed,
   and ANN was used to simulate the effects of specific GFCT parameters on
   overall results. Using these results, ANN concepts related to
   architecture, sampling, training, and multiple function approximations
   are studied, and ANN training using back-propagation algorithm (BPA) and
   genetic algorithm (GA) an compared. These results are summarized, and
   appropriate conclusions are made. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

   whose log hydraulic conductivity distribution has a variance greater

   studied. They are: (1) continuous waste leakage from landfills; (2)
   temporal waste leakage from landfills; (3) continuous deep-well
   injection wastes; and (4) temporal deep-well injection wastes. Ensemble
   average concentrations and variances of concentration distributions are
   calculated for the four scenarios. The results in this paper show that
   when heterogeneity of a formation increases, transport in this formation
   differs significantly from the linear solutions which assume that the
   variances of log hydraulic conductivity are less than unity. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Understanding light nonaqueous-phase liquid (LNAPL) movement in
   heterogeneous vadose environments is important for effective remediation
   design. We investigated LNAPL movement near a sloping fine- over
   coarse-grained textural interface, forming a capillary barrier. LNAPL
   flow experiments were performed in a glass chamber (50 cm x 60 cm x 1.0
   cm) using two silica sands (12/20 and 30/40 sieve sizes). Variable water
   saturations near the textural interface were generated by applying water
   uniformly to the sand surface at various flow rates. A model LNAPL
   (Soltrol(R) 220) was subsequently released at two locations at the sand
   surface. Visible light transmission was used to quantitatively determine
   water saturations prior to LNAPL release and to observe LNAPL flow
   paths. Numerical simulations were performed using the Subsurface
   Transport Over Multiple Phases (STOMP) simulator, employing two
   nonhysteretic relative permeability-saturation-pressure (k-S-P) models.
   LNAPL movement strongly depended on the water saturation in the
   fine-grained sand layer above the textural interface. In general,
   reasonable agreement was found between observed and predicted water
   saturations near the textural interface and LNAPL Bow paths.
   Discrepancies between predictions based on the van Genuchten/ Mualem
   (VGM) and Brooks-Corey/Burdine (BCB) k-S-P models existed in the
   migration speed of the simulated LNAPL plume and the LNAPL Bow patterns
   at high water saturation above the textural interface. In both
   instances, predictions based on the BCB model agreed better with
   experimental observations than predictions based on the VGM model. The
   results confirm the critical role water saturation plays in determining
   LNAPL movement in heterogeneous vadose zone environments and that
   accurate prediction of LNAPL flow paths depends on the careful selection
   of an appropriate k-S-P model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{We present an efficient numerical method for solving stochastic porous
   media flow problems. Single-phase flow with a random conductivity field
   is considered in a standard first-order perturbation expansion
   framework. The numerical scheme, based on finite element techniques, is
   computationally more efficient than traditional approaches because one
   can work with a much coarser finite element mesh. This is achieved by
   avoiding the common finite element representation of the conductivity
   field. Computations with the random conductivity field only arise in
   integrals of the log conductivity covariance function. The method is
   demonstrated in several two- and three-dimensional flow situations and
   compared to analytical solutions and Monte Carlo simulations. Provided
   that the integrals involving the covariance of the log conductivity are
   computed by higher-order Gaussian quadrature rules, excellent results
   can be obtained with characteristic element sizes equal to about five
   correlation lengths of the log conductivity field. Investigations of the
   Validity of the proposed first-order method are performed by comparing
   nonlinear Monte Carlo results with linear solutions. In box-shaped
   domains the log conductivity standard deviation oy may be as large as
   1.5, while the head variance is considerably influenced by nonlinear
   effects as ay approaches unity in more general domains. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The Stokes problem describes how of an incompressible constant-viscosity
   fluid when the Reynolds number is small so that inertial and
   transient-time effects are negligible. The numerical solution of the
   Stokes problem requires special care, since classical finite element
   discretization schemes, such as piecewise linear interpolation for both
   the velocity and the pressure, fail to perform. Even when an appropriate
   scheme is adopted, the grid must be selected so that the error is as
   small as possible. Much of the challenge in solving Stokes problems is
   how to account for complex geometry and to capture important features
   such as flow separation. This paper applies adaptive mesh techniques,
   using a posteriori error estimates, in the finite element solution of
   the Stokes equations that model flow at pore scales. Different selected
   numerical test cases associated with various porous geometrics are
   presented and discussed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of
   our methodology. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.}},

Abstract = {{In this article we consider the transport of an adsorbing solute in a
   two-region model of a chemically and mechanically heterogeneous porous
   medium when the condition of large-scale mechanical equilibrium is
   valid. Under these circumstances, a one-equation model can be used to
   predict the large-scale averaged velocity, but a two-equation model may
   be required to predict the regional velocities that are needed to
   accurately describe the solute transport process. If the condition of
   large-scale mass equilibrium is valid, the solute transport process can
   be represented in terms of a one-equation model and the analysis is
   greatly simplified. The constraints associated with the condition of
   large-scale mass equilibrium are developed, and when these constraints
   are satisfied the mass transport process can be described in terms of
   the large-scale average velocity, an average adsorption isotherm, and a
   single large-scale dispersion tensor. When the condition of large-scale
   mass equilibrium is not valid, two equations are required to describe
   the mass transfer process, and these two equations contain two
   adsorption isotherms, two dispersion tensors, and an exchange
   coefficient. The extension of the analysis to multi-region models is
   straight forward but tedious. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{this paper we develop the two-equation model for solute transport and
   adsorption in a two-region model of a mechanically and chemically
   heterogeneous porous medium. The closure problem is derived and the
   coefficients in both the one- and two-equation models are determined on
   the basis of the Darcy-scale parameters. Numerical experiments are
   carried out for a stratified system at the aquifer scale, and the
   results are compared with the one-equation model presented in Part IV
   and the two-equation model developed in this paper. Good agreement
   between the two-equation model and the numerical experiments is
   obtained. In addition, the two-equation model is used, in conjunction
   with a moment analysis, to derive a one-equation, non-equilibrium model
   that is valid in the asymptotic regime. Numerical results are used to
   identify the asymptotic regime for the one-equation, non-equilibrium
   model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.}},

Abstract = {{An iterative co-conditional Monte Carlo simulation (IMCS) approach is
   developed. This approach derives co-conditional means and variances of
   transmissivity (T), head (phi), and Darcy's velocity (q), based on
   sparse measurements of T and phi in heterogeneous, confined aquifers
   under steady-state conditions. It employs the classical co-conditional
   Monte Carlo simulation technique (MCS) and a successive linear estimator
   that takes advantage of our prior knowledge of the covariances of T and
   phi and their cross-covariance. In each co-conditional simulation, a
   linear estimate of T is improved by solving the governing steady-state
   flow equation, and by updating residual covariance functions
   iteratively. These residual covariance functions consist of the
   covariance of T and phi and the cross-covariance function between T and
   phi. As a result, the non-linear relationship between T and phi is
   incorporated in the co-conditional realizations of T and phi. Once the T
   and phi fields are generated, a corresponding velocity field is also
   calculated. The average of the co-conditioned realizations of T, phi,
   and q yields the co-conditional mean fields. In turn, the co-conditional
   variances of T, phi, and q, which measure the reduction in uncertainty
   due to measurements of T and phi, are derived. Results of our numerical
   experiments show that the co-conditional means from IMCS for T and phi
   fields have smaller mean square errors (MSE) than those from a
   non-iterative Monte Carlo simulation (NIMCS). Finally, the
   co-conditional mean fields from IMCS are compared with the
   co-conditional effective fields from a direct approach developed by Yeh

Abstract = {{Field-scale transport of bromacil (5-bromo-3-sec-butyl-6-methyluracil)
   was analyzed using two different model processes for local description
   of the transport. The first was the classical, one-region convection
   dispersion equation (CDE) model while the second was the two-region,
   mobile-immobile (MIM) model. The analyses were performed by means of
   detailed three-dimensional, numerical simulations of the how and the
   transport {[}Russo, D., Zaidel, J. and Laufer, A., Numerical analysis of
   flow and transport in a three-dimensional partially saturated
   heterogeneous soil. Water Resour. Res., 1998, in press](1), employing
   local soil hydraulic properties parameters from field measurements and
   local adsorption/desorption coefficients and the first-order degradation
   rate coefficient from laboratory measurements. Results of the analyses
   suggest that for a given flow regime, mass exchange between the mobile
   and the immobile regions retards the bromacil degradation, considerably
   affects the distribution of the bromacil resident concentration, c, at
   relatively large travel times, slightly affects the spatial moments of
   the distribution of c, and increases the skewing of the bromacil
   breakthrough and the uncertainty in its prediction, compared with the
   case in which the soil contained only a single (mobile) region. Mean and
   standard deviation of the simulated concentration profiles at various
   elapsed times were compared with measurements from a field-scale
   transport experiment {[}Tauber-Yasur, I., Hadas, A., Russo, D. and
   Yaron, B., Leaching of terbuthylazine and bromacil through field soils.

   site. Given the limitations of the present study (e.g. the lack of
   detailed field data on the spatial variability of the soil chemical
   properties) the main conclusion of the present study is that the
   field-scale transport of bromacil at the Bet Dagan site is better
   quantified with the MIM model than the CDE model. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The equations for a compositional model for simulation of a two-phase,
   three-component system with inter-phase mass transfer are developed.
   Emphasis is placed on development of inter-phase mass transfer equations
   for incorporation of rate-limited inter-phase mass transfer. Due to the
   nature of the three-component systems considered, a single-film model
   may be inadequate and a two-film model must be utilized. A two-film
   model accounts for the simultaneous transfer of components in both
   directions across phase interfaces. The effect of interaction between
   components on diffusion is considered using a general form of Fick's
   Law. A Hand Plot representation of ternary phase behavior is chosen
   since it allows for straightforward calculation of miscibility of bulk
   phases under conditions of local non-equilibrium. The developed set of
   equations form the basis for a numerical model to simulate the enhanced
   removal of non-aqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) from porous media using
   single-component alcohol floods. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{A non-equilibrium, two-phase, three-component compositional model for
   the simulation of alcohol flooding has been developed and tested.
   Inter-phase mass transfer algorithms allow for transfer of all three
   components at high concentrations and high mass flux rates using a
   two-film model. The model has been used to simulate alcohol floods where
   the alcohol has an affinity for either the water-rich phase, or the
   organic-rich phase. Calibration, using experimental effluent data from
   an alcohol flood which used a 2-propanol (TPA)-water-tetrachlorethene
   (PCE) ternary system, indicates that inter-phase mass transfer
   parameters can be non-unique. Sensitivity studies, completed using the
   non-equilibrium model for the IPA-water-PCE system, indicate that
   experimentally derived organic-rich phase composition data should lead
   to better estimates of the non-wetting phase film thickness. For alcohol
   flooding experiments where the primary mechanism of non-aqueous phase
   liquid (NAPL) removal is enhanced dissolution, near-equilibrium
   conditions may be achieved with NAPL recovery similar for conditions of
   near-equilibrium and equilibrium. However, for systems where
   remobilization is the primary mechanism of NAPL recovery, it is expected
   that although local conditions may approach equilibrium, the resulting
   NAPL recovery can be significantly lower than would be attained if
   equilibrium conditions persisted. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{A quasi three-dimensional (QUASI 3-D) model is presented for simulating
   the subsurface water flow and solute transport in the unsaturated and in
   the saturated zones of soil. The model is based on the assumptions of
   vertical how in the unsaturated zone and essentially horizontal
   groundwater flow. The 1-D Richards equation for the unsaturated zone is
   coupled at the phreatic surface with the 2-D flow equation for the
   saturated zone. The latter was obtained by averaging 3-D flow equation
   in the saturated zone over the aquifer thickness. Unlike the Boussinesq
   equation for a leaky-phreatic aquifer, the developed model does not
   contain a storage term with specific yield and a source term for natural
   replenishment. Instead it includes a water flux term at the phreatic
   surface through which the Richards equation is linked with the
   groundwater flow equation. The vertical water flux in the saturated zone
   is evaluated on the basis of the fluid mass balance equation while the
   horizontal fluxes, in that equation, are prescribed by Darcy law. A 3-D
   transport equation is used to simulate the solute migration. A numerical
   algorithm to solve the problem for the general quasi 3-D case was
   developed. The developed methodology was exemplified for the quasi 2-D
   cross-sectional case (QUASI2D). Simulations for three synthetic problems
   demonstrate good agreement between the results obtained by QUASI2D and
   two fully 2-D flow and transport codes (SUTRA and 2DSOIL).Yet,
   simulations with the QUASI2D code were several times faster than those
   by the SUTRA and the 2DSOIL codes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

Abstract = {{A comparison of Standard Galerkin, Petrov-Galerkin, and Fully-Upwind
   Galerkin methods for the simulation of two-phase flow in heterogeneous
   porous media is presented. On the basis of the coupled
   pressure-saturation equations, a generalized formulation for all three
   finite element methods is derived and analysed. For flow in homogeneous
   media, the Petrov-Galerkin method gives excellent results. But this
   method fails miserably for problems with heterogeneous media. This is
   because it is not able to capture correctly processes that take place at
   interfaces when, for instance, the capillary pressure-saturation
   relationship after Brooks and Corey is assumed. The Fully-Upwind
   Galerkin method is superior to the Petrov-Galerkin approach because it
   is able to give comet results for flow in homogeneous and heterogeneous
   media for the two models of van Genuchten and Brooks-Corey. The widely
   used dp(c)/dS(w) grad S-w formulation which is correct for the
   homogeneous case cannot be used for heterogeneous media. Instead the
   straightforward approach of grad p(c) in combination with a chord-slope
   technique must be utilized. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{In wet soils, zones of saturation naturally develop in the vicinity of
   impermeable strata, surface ponds and subterranean cavities. Hydrology
   must be then concerned with transient flow through coexisting
   unsaturated and saturated zones. The models of advancing saturated zones
   necessarily involve a nonlinear free boundary problem.
   A closed-form analytic solution is presented for a nonlinear diffusion
   model under conditions of pending at the surface. The soil water
   diffusivity is restricted to the special functional form D(theta) = a/(b
   - theta)(2) where theta is the water content field to be determined and
   a, b are positive constants. The explicit solution depends on a
   parameter C (determined by the data of the problem), according to two
   cases: 1 < C < C-1 or C greater than or equal to C-1, where C-1 is a
   constant which is obtained as the unique solution of an equation. This
   result complements the study given in P. Broadbridge, Water Resources
   Research, 1990, 26, 2435-2443, in order to established when the explicit
   solution is available. The behavior of the bifurcation parameter C-1 as
   a function of the driving potential is studied with the corresponding
   limits for small and large values. Moreover, the sorptivity is proven to
   be continuously differentiable function of the variable C. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The reconstruction of the transmissivity field from the more numerous
   experimental hydraulic head data, an inverse problem, remains the focus
   of continuing stochastic-based research. The difficulty of this problem
   arises not only from the complexity of the diffusion equation that links
   the two variables, but also from taking into account the physical
   aspects of the site under study; e.g. the boundary conditions, the
   effective recharge, and the geology. In practical applications, the
   validity of purely analytical techniques proposed to date is Limited by
   certain simplifying assumptions, like the linearization of the flow
   equation, made in order to obtain a solution. For this reason, a hybrid
   methodology combining geostatistical techniques with deterministic
   numerical flow simulators is proposed. This combination allows the
   numerical calculation of the direct and cross covariances needed to
   cokrige the transmissivity from both the transmissivity and hydraulic
   head data. The flexibility of numerical flow simulators takes away the
   need for the simplifying assumptions of analytical techniques to apply
   the proposed methodology. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, details of a conjunctive surface-subsurface numerical
   model for the simulation of overland flow are presented. In this model,
   the complete one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations for the surface flow
   are solved by a simple, explicit, essentially non-oscillating (ENO)
   scheme. The two-dimensional Richards equation in the mixed form for the
   subsurface flow is solved using an efficient strongly implicit
   finite-difference scheme. The explicit scheme for the surface flow
   component results in a simple method for connecting the surface and
   subsurface components. The model is verified using the experimental data
   and previous numerical results available in the literature. The proposed
   model is used to study the two-dimensionality effects due to
   non-homogeneous subsurface characteristics. Applicability of the model
   to handle complex subsurface conditions is demonstrated. (C)1998

Abstract = {{Advances in computer power and in reservoir characterization allow
   simulation of pressure transients in complex reservoirs generated
   stochastically. Generally, interpretation of these transients gives
   useful information about the reservoir hydraulic properties: a major
   goal is to interpret these transients in the stochastic context. First
   we ensemble average the pressure over all the random permeability held
   realizations to derive an equation which drives the ensemble averaged
   pressure. We use the Fourier transform in space and the Laplace
   transform in time, in conjunction with a perturbation series expansion
   in successive powers of the permeability fluctuations to obtain an
   explicit solution. The Nth order term of this series involves the
   hydrodynamic interaction between N permeability heterogeneities and
   after averaging we obtain an expansion containing correlation functions
   of permeability fluctuations of increasing order.
   Next, Feynman graphs are introduced allowing a more attractive graphical
   interpretation of the perturbation series. Then series summation
   techniques are employed to reduce the graph number to be summed at each
   order of the fluctuation expansion. This in turn gives useful physical
   insights on the homogenization processes involved. In particular, it is
   shown that the sum of the so-called `one-particle irreducible graphs'
   gives the kernel of a Linear integro-differential equation obeyed by the
   ensemble average pressure. All the information about the heterogeneity
   structure is contained in this renormalized kernel, which is a Limited
   range function.
   This equation on its own is the starting point of useful asymptotic
   results and approximations. In particular it is shown that
   interpretation of pumping tests yields the steady-state equivalent
   permeability after a sufficiently long time for an infinite reservoir,
   as expected. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A heuristic algorithm is presented for problems which are formulated to
   find an optimal groundwater remediation strategy with constraints on
   confined groundwater how and contaminant transport. The problem is
   simplified by decoupling the transport constraints from the hydraulic
   constraints to produce a linear hydraulic control optimization problem.
   The solution is obtained by an iterative process in which the
   constraints on hydraulic gradient are updated, using information from
   transport simulation, and the hydraulic control problem is solved
   repeatedly. In effect, the transport simulation is used to calibrate the
   head difference constraint values of the hydraulic control problem. The
   algorithm is described in detail and its convergence is demonstrated on
   several examples. The advantages and limitations of the algorithm are
   discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The interface of two immiscible fluids flowing in porous media may
   behave in an unstable fashion. This instability is governed by the pore
   distribution, differential viscosity and interface tension between the
   two immiscible fluids. This study investigates the factors that control
   the interface instability at the wetting front. The development of the
   how equation is based on the mass balance principle, with boundary
   conditions such as the velocity continuity and capillary pressure
   balance at the interface. By assuming that the two-phase fluids in
   porous media are saturated, a covariance function of the wetting front
   position is derived by stochastic theory. According to those results,
   the unstable interface between two immiscible fluids is governed by the
   fluid velocity and properties such as viscosity and density. The fluid
   properties that affect the interface instability are expressed as
   dimensionless parameters, mobility ratio, capillary number and Bond
   number. If the fluid flow is driven by gravitational force, whether the
   interface undergoes upward displacement or downward displacement, the
   variance of the unstable interface decreases with an increasing mobility
   ratio, increases with increasing capillary number, and decreases with
   increasing Bond number. For a circumstance in which fluid flow is
   horizontal, our results demonstrate that the capillary number does not
   influence the generation of the unstable interface. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop the regional form of Darcy's law when the
   condition of large-scale mechanical equilibrium is valid. This condition
   occurs for many steady or quasi-steady flows of practical importance,
   and analytical constraints are presented which define the domain of
   validity for large-scale mechanical equilibrium. Given a two-region
   model of a heterogeneous porous medium, the intrinsic region-averaged
   velocities can be expressed in terms of the large-scale average velocity
   according to
   theta(eta)\{(Y-beta)(eta)\}(eta)=M-beta eta{*} (.)\{(v beta)\}, in the
   eta-region
   theta(omega)\{(V-beta)(omega)\}(omega) = M-beta omega{*}(.)\{(V-beta)\},
   in the omega- region
   Here the mapping tensors M-beta eta{*} and M-beta omega{*} are specified
   by the same closure problem used to determine the effective thermal
   conductivity tensor for a two-phase system, and they are directly
   related to the regional permeability tensors K-beta eta{*} and K-beta
   omega{*} Regional permeability tensors are determined far stratified
   systems, for a nodular model of heterogeneous porous media, and for
   fractured porous media. These large scale permeabilities are sensitive
   to the structure of the mechanical heterogeneities and in general they
   are not equal to the local permeability that is used to characterize the
   mechanical heterogeneities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider one-dimensional capillary redistribution of
   two immiscible and incompressible fluids in a porous medium with a
   single discontinuity. We study a special time-dependent solution, a
   similarity solution, which is found when the initial saturation is
   discontinuous at the same point as the permeability and porosity, and is
   constant elsewhere. The similarity solution can be used to validate
   numerical algorithms describing two-phase flow in porous media with
   discontinuous heterogeneities. We discuss the construction of the
   similarity solution, in which we pay special attention to the interface
   conditions at the discontinuity, both for media with positive and zero
   entry pressure. Moreover, we discuss some qualitative properties of the
   solution, and outline a numerical procedure to determine its graph.
   Examples are given for the Brooks-Corey and Van Genuchten model. We also
   consider similarity solutions for unsaturated water flow, which is a
   limit case of two-phase flow for negligible nonwetting phase viscosity.

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology, based on dynamical systems theory,
   to model and predict streamflow at the daily scale. The model is
   constructed by developing a multidimensional phase-space map from
   observed streamflow signals. Predictions are made by examining
   trajectories oil the reconstructed phase space. Prediction accuracy is
   used as a diagnostic tool to characterize the nature. which ranges from
   low-order deterministic to stochastic, of streamflow signals. To
   demonstrate the utility of this diagnostic tool, the proposed method is
   first applied to a time series with known characteristics. The paper
   shows that the proposed phase-space model can be used to make a
   tentative distinction between a noisy signal and a deterministic chaotic
   signal.
   The proposed phase-space model is then applied to daily streamflow
   records for 28 selected stations from the Continental United States
   covering basin areas between 31 and 35079 km(2). Based on the analyses
   of these 28 streamflow time series and 13 artificially generated signals
   with known characteristics, no direct relationship between the nature of
   underlying streamflow characteristics and basin area has been found. In
   addition, there does not appear to be any physical threshold (in terms
   of basin area, average flow rate and yield) that controls the change in
   streamflow dynamics at the daily scale. These results suggest that the
   daily streamflow signals span a wide dynamical range between
   deterministic chaos and periodic signal contaminated with additive
   noise. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical approach for approximating statistical moments of hydraulic
   heads of variably saturated flows in multi-dimensional porous media is
   developed. The approximation relies on a first-order Taylor series
   expansion of a finite element flow model and an adjoint state numerical
   method for variably saturated flows to evaluate sensitivities. This
   approach can be employed to analyze uncertainties associated with
   predictions of head of steady-state or transient flows in variably
   saturated porous media, with any type of boundary and initial
   conditions. Limitations of stochastic analytical methods such as
   spectral/perturbation approaches and the time-consuming Monte Carlo
   simulation technique are thus alleviated. An example is given to
   demonstrate the utility of the approach and to investigate the temporal
   evolution of head variances in a variably saturated flow regime. Results
   show that the fluctuation of the water table can have significant
   impacts on the propagation of the head variance. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Transport of a sorbing solute in a two-dimensional steady and uniform
   flow field is modeled using a particle tracking random walk method. The
   solute is initially introduced from an instantaneous point source. Cases
   of linear and nonlinear sorption isotherms are considered. Local pore
   velocity and mechanical dispersion are used to describe the solute
   transport mechanisms at the local scale. The numerical simulation of
   solute particle transport yields the large scale behavior of the solute
   plume. Behavior of the plume is quantified in terms of the
   center-of-mass displacement distance, relative velocity of the
   center-of-mass, mass breakthrough curves, spread variance, and
   longitudinal skewness. The nonlinear sorption isotherm affects the plume
   behavior in the following way relative to the linear isotherm: (1) the
   plume velocity decreases exponentially with time; (2) the longitudinal
   variance increases nonlinearly with time; (3) the solute front is
   steepened and tailing is enhanced. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

Abstract = {{Global optimization methods such as simulated annealing, genetic
   algorithms and tabu search are being increasingly used to solve
   groundwater remediation design and parameter identification problems.
   While these methods enjoy some unique advantages over traditional
   gradient based methods, they typically require thousands to tens of
   thousands of forward simulation runs before reaching optimal or
   near-optimal solutions. Thus, one severe limitation associated with
   these global optimization methods is very long computation time. To
   mitigate this limitation, this paper presents a new approach for
   obtaining, repeatedly and efficiently, the solutions of a linear forward
   simulation model subject to successive perturbations. The proposed
   approach takes advantage of the fact that successive forward simulation
   runs, as required by a global optimization procedure, usually involve
   only slight changes in the coefficient matrices of the resultant linear
   equations. As a result, the new solution to a system of linear equations
   perturbed by the changes in aquifer properties and/or sinks/sources can
   be obtained as the sum of a non-perturbed base solution and the solution
   to the perturbed portion of the linear equations. The computational
   efficiency of the proposed approach arises from the fact that the
   perturbed solution can be derived directly without solving the linear
   equations again. A two-dimensional test problem with 20 by 30 nodes
   demonstrates that the proposed approach is much more efficient than
   repeatedly running the simulation model, by more than 15 times after a
   fixed number of model evaluations. The ratio of speedup increases with
   the number of model evaluations and also the size of simulation model.
   The main limitation of the proposed approach is the large amount of
   computer memory required to store the inverse matrix. Effective ways for
   limiting the storage requirement are briefly discussed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The flow of groundwater in the bedrock, which might jeopardize the
   possibility of repositing nuclear waste at great depth in the rock, is
   mainly governed by the large scale properties of the topography. The
   topography of Sweden is characterized by the Caledonian mountain chain,
   which runs through a large part of the Scandinavian peninsula, and by
   regular large ridges and valleys that are almost perpendicular to the
   mountain chain. The hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock decreases with
   the depth, and the characteristic length scale of this variation is much
   less than the length scale of the topography. The result of the
   analysis, given here exclusively as closed formulae, shows that the flow
   takes place in the uppermost 500 m of the bedrock, which is
   approximately the depth of a future repository. The analysis also shows
   that the residence time of a fluid particle is inversely proportional to
   the hydraulic gradient and to the ratio between the length scale of the
   topography and the conductivity. The residence time also depends on the
   ratio between the lengths that characterize the topography and the
   variation of the conductivity with depth. The shortest residence time
   occurs if the repository is located below a valley, and the longest if
   it is located under a ridge. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{Many important physical and chemical processes occur at phase
   boundaries. The role of surface phenomena is frequently underestimated
   or overlooked although surfaces play a significant role in many natural
   science disciplines. Experimental data from the literature indicate that
   in adsorption from solution, most of the adsorbates move to the
   adsorbent surface in a relatively short time period. Actual adsorption
   equilibrium, however, may take longer to establish. in this study time
   variable parametric experiments were performed with Co and a suspended
   mar:ne sediment sample. Two different time dependencies were observed: a
   rapid step that reached equilibrium in 5-10 days, while a slower step
   continued for more than 100 days. Observed behavior was simulated with a
   time-dependent model that differentiates the slow and fast steps. The
   fast step was considered to be due to diffusion of the adsorbate to the
   external and macropore surface of the adsorbent and exchange at surface
   sites, while the slow step was considered as diffusion of adsorbate into
   the adsorbent micropore capillaries where adsorptive binding occurs. (C)

Abstract = {{A p finite element scheme and parallel iterative solver are introduced
   for a modified form of the shallow water equations. The governing
   equations are the three-dimensional shallow water equations. After a
   harmonic decomposition in time and rearrangement, the resulting
   equations are a complex Helmholz problem for surface elevation, and a
   complex momentum equation for the horizontal velocity. Both equations
   are nonlinear and the resulting system is solved using the Picard
   iteration combined with a preconditioned biconjugate gradient (PBCG)
   method for the linearized subproblems. A subdomain-based parallel
   preconditioner is developed which uses incomplete LU factorization with
   thresholding (ILUT) methods within subdomains, overlapping ILUT
   factorizations for subdomain boundaries and under-relaxed iteration for
   the resulting block system. The method builds on techniques successfully
   applied to linear elements by introducing ordering and condensation
   techniques to handle uniform p refinement. The combined methods show
   good performance for a range of p (element order), h (element size), and
   N (number of processors). Performance and scalability results are
   presented for a field scale problem where up to 512 processors are used.

Abstract = {{A modeling approach is presented that optimizes separate phase recovery
   of light non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPL) for a single dual-extraction
   well in a homogeneous, isotropic unconfined aquifer. A
   simulation/regression/optimization (S/R/O) model is developed to
   predict, analyze, and optimize the oil recovery process. The approach
   combines detailed simulation, nonlinear regression, and optimization.
   The S/R/O model utilizes nonlinear regression equations describing
   system response to time-varying water pumping and oil skimming.
   Regression equations are developed for residual oil volume and free oil
   volume. The S/R/O model determines optimized time-varying (stepwise)
   pumping rates which minimize residual oil volume and maximize free oil
   recovery while causing free oil volume to decrease a specified amount.
   This S/R/O modeling approach implicitly immobilizes the free product
   plume by reversing the water table gradient while achieving containment.
   Application to a simple representative problem illustrates the S/R/O
   model utility for problem analysis and remediation design. When compared
   with the best steady pumping strategies, the optimal stepwise pumping
   strategy improves free oil recovery by 11.5\% and reduces the amount of
   residual oil left in the system due to pumping by 15\%. The S/R/O model
   approach offers promise for enhancing the design of free phase LNAPL
   recovery systems and to help in making cost-effective operation and
   management decisions for hydrogeologists, engineers, and regulators. (C)

Abstract = {{Flow and displacement of non-Newtonian fluids in porous media occurs in
   many subsurface systems, related to underground natural resource
   recovery and storage projects, as well as environmental remediation
   schemes. A thorough understanding of non-Newtonian fluid flow through
   porous media is of fundamental importance in these engineering
   applications. Considerable progress has been made in our understanding
   of single-phase porous flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids through
   many quantitative and experimental studies over the past few decades.
   However, very little research can be found in the literature regarding
   multi-phase non-Newtonian fluid flow or numerical modeling approaches
   for such analyses.
   For non-Newtonian fluid flow through porous media, the governing
   equations become nonlinear, even under single-phase Bow conditions,
   because effective viscosity for the non-Newtonian fluid is a highly
   nonlinear function of the shear rate, or the pore velocity. The solution
   for such problems can in general only be obtained by numerical methods.
   We have developed a three-dimensional, fully implicit, integral finite
   difference simulator for single-and multi-phase flow of non-Newtonian
   fluids in porous/fractured media. The methodology, architecture and
   numerical scheme of the model are based on a general multi-phase,
   multi-component fluid and heat flow simulator-TOUGH2. Several
   rheological models for power-law and Bingham non-Newtonian fluids have
   been incorporated into the model. In addition, the model predictions on
   single-and multi-phase flow of the power-law and Bingham fluids have
   been verified against the analytical solutions available for these
   problems, and in all the cases the numerical simulations are in good
   agreement with the analytical solutions. In this presentation, we will
   discuss the numerical scheme used in the treatment of non-Newtonian
   properties, and several benchmark problems for model verification.
   In an effort to demonstrate the three-dimensional modeling capability of
   the model, a three-dimensional, two-phase flow example is also presented
   to examine the model results using laboratory and simulation results
   existing for the three-dimensional problem with Newtonian fluid flow.

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional (2D) unsteady simulation model is applied to the
   problem of a submerged warm water discharge into a stratified lake or
   reservoir with an ice cover. Numerical simulations and analyses are
   conducted to gain insight into large-scale convective recirculation and
   flow processes in a cold waterbody induced by a buoyant jet. Jet
   behaviors under various discharge temperatures are captured by directly
   modeling flow and thermal fields. Flow structures and processes are
   described by the simulated spatial and temporal distributions of
   velocity and temperature in various regions: deflection, recirculation,
   attachment, and impingement. Some peculiar hydrothermal and dynamic
   features, e.g. reversal of buoyancy due to the dilution of a warm jet by
   entraining cold ambient water, are identified and examined. Simulation
   results show that buoyancy is the most important factor controlling jet
   behavior and mixing processes. The inflow boundary is treated as a
   liquid wall from which the jet is offset. Similarity and difference in
   effects of boundaries perpendicular and parallel to flow, and of
   buoyancy on jet attachment and impingement, are discussed. Symmetric
   flow configuration is used to de-emphasize the Coanda effect caused by
   offset. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of rainfall on the spatial-temporal soil moisture variability
   is investigated by using a model of the soil moisture dynamics and two
   rainfall models, the noise-forced diffusive precipitation model and the
   WGR model. The study shows that the variability of the soil moisture
   field is impacted during the limited time of the storm period. During
   the interstorm period, the variability of the soil moisture field is
   closely related with the soil texture, as supported by the analysis of
   the Washita `92 data set. As the impact of rainfall on the variability
   of the soil moisture field is limited to the short time period of
   precipitation, the role of the rainfall is simplified as a source of
   water to the soil moisture field without any consideration of its
   variability and/or organization in space. A simulation study of the soil
   moisture field temporal evolution also supports this result, i.e. a
   strong relationship between the soil moisture field and the variability
   of its medium. Also, larger variabilities of the loss field coefficient
   result in easier removal of moisture from the soil. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It is often convenient to use synthetically generated random fields to
   study the hydrologic effects of spatial heterogeneity. Although there
   are many ways to produce such fields, spectral techniques are
   particularly attractive because they are fast and conceptually
   straightforward. This paper describes a spectral algorithm for
   generating sets of random fields which are correlated with one another.
   The algorithm is based on a discrete version of the Fourier-Stieltjes
   representation for multidimensional random fields. The Fourier increment
   used in this representation depends on a random phase angle process and
   a complex-valued spectral factor matrix which can be readily derived
   from a specified set of cross-spectral densities (or cross-covariances).
   The inverse Fourier transform of the Fourier increment is a complex
   random field with real and imaginary parts which each have the desired
   coveriance structure. Our complex-valued spectral formulation provides
   an especially convenient way to generate a set of random fields which
   all depend on a single underlying (independent) field, provided that the
   fields in question can be related by space-invariant linear
   transformations. We illustrate this by generating multi-dimensional mass
   conservative groundwater velocity fields which can be used to simulate
   solute transport through heterogeneous anisotropic porous media. (C)

Abstract = {{This work continues the analysis of variable density flow in groundwater
   systems. It focuses on both thermohaline (double-diffusive) and
   three-dimensional (3D) buoyancy-driven convection processes. The
   finite-element method is utilized to tackle these complex non-linear
   problems in two and three dimensions. The preferred numerical approaches
   are discussed regarding appropriate basic formulations,
   balance-consistent discretization techniques for derivative quantities,
   extension of the Boussinesq approximation, proper constraint conditions,
   time marching schemes, and computational strategies for solving large
   systems. Applications are presented for the thermohaline Elder and salt
   dome problem as well as for the 3D extension of the Elder problem with
   and without thermohaline effects and a 3D Benard convection process. The
   simulations are performed by using the package FEFLOW. Conclusions are
   drawn with respect to numerical efforts and the appropriateness for
   practical needs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides the tools needed for analysis of multiphase flow in
   porous media. Contributions are in four areas. First, theorems are
   provided that allow global scale integral equations to be localized at
   the porous medium scale. This is a more general approach than the
   traditional averaging of microscale point equations. Second,
   conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy and entropy for
   phases, interfaces, common lines, and common points are obtained. The
   inclusion of common lines and common points completes the full
   description of multiphase flow in porous media. Third, the entropy
   inequality is developed for the full multiphase system. The interaction
   terms between phases, interfaces, common lines, and common points
   provide a clear direction as to whether the entropy equation for each of
   these components may be used in the development of a constitutive theory
   or if the constitutive theory will depend on a combined entropy
   inequality statement. Fourth, the simplification of the system of
   equations is presented for the case of massless interfaces and common
   lines where these constituents are still capable of sustaining stress
   and containing energy. These latter forms are particularly useful in
   consideration of capillary pressure terms when the mass of the interface
   may be considered negligible. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited. All

Abstract = {{This paper illustrates the application of two decomposition algorithms,
   generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) and outer approximation (OA), to
   water resources problems involving cost functions with both discrete and
   nonlinear terms. Each algorithm involves the solution of an alternating
   finite sequence of nonlinear programming subproblems and relaxed
   versions of a mixed-integer linear programming master problem. Three
   example models, involving capacity expansion of a conjunctively managed
   surface and groundwater system, are formulated and solved to demonstrate
   the performance of the algorithms. The results show that OA obtains
   solutions in far fewer iterations than GBD, but OA requires more
   computational resources per iteration. As a result, depending on the
   mixed-integer programming and nonlinear programming solvers available,
   GBD may be better suited for solving larger planning problems. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Diffusion of dissolved contaminants in multilayer porous media is an
   important phenomenon affecting both contamination and remediation in
   natural aqueous environments, including diffusion in groundwater
   aquitards and contaminated bed sediments. This study presents a new
   analytical solution for solute diffusion in a semi-infinite two-layer
   porous medium for arbitrary boundary and initial conditions. The
   solution was obtained by using the Green's function approach in the
   Laplace domain with the application of the binomial theorem to
   facilitate inversion back to the real time domain. Results based on this
   solution were found to be simple both in form and ease of calculation
   and to be in good agreement with those obtained using numerical
   calculations based on the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method.
   Applications of the solution are presented in the context of a
   contaminated groundwater aquitard to demonstrate how different boundary
   and initial conditions can greatly affect the contamination and
   decontamination of porous media, and to illustrate how diffusion
   modeling might be used in a forensic sense. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The paper deals with numerical solutions to the Richards equation to
   simulate one-dimensional how processes in the unsaturated zone of
   layered soil profiles. The equation is expressed in the pressure-based
   form and a finite-difference algorithm is developed for accurately
   estimating the values of the hydraulic conductivity between two
   neighboring nodes positioned in different soil layers, often referred to
   as the interlayer hydraulic conductivity. The algorithm is based upon
   flux conservation and continuity of pressure potential at the interface
   between two consecutive layers, and does not add significantly to
   simulation run time. The validity of the model is established for a
   number of test problems by comparing numerical results with the
   analytical solutions developed by Srivastava and Yeh(29) which hold for
   vertical infiltration towards the water table in a two-layer soil
   profile. The results show a significant reduction in relative mass
   balance errors when using the proposed model. Some specific insights
   into its numerical performance are also gained by comparisons with a
   numerical model in which the more common geometric averaging operator
   acts on the interlayer conductivities. (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Mathematical expressions are derived for the hydraulic exponents M and N
   as functions of the gradually varied flow (GVF) depth using a circular
   channel section. The derived expressions of M(y/d(0)) and N(y/d(0)) for
   continuously varying depth are compared to exponents M and N proposed by
   Chow {[}Chow, V.T., Integrating the equation of gradually varied flow.
   ASCE, Proc. 81, Vol. 11, 1955] using constant averaged GVF depths. The
   exponent N shows a remarkable difference (an opposite trend). The
   computation of the GVF length is calculated using the exponents M and N
   for varying and constant averaged GVF depths. Numerical integration
   approach based on the Simpson's rule method is used to calculate the GVF
   length. The results of the calculated GVF profile length using the
   derived exponents M(y/d(0)) and N(y/d(0)) are found to be closer to the
   GVF length calculated from the exact formulation of the GVF dynamic
   equation. The percentage difference ranges from 0.017 to 6.9\% for
   various bed slopes and GVF depth limits. Using the Chow {[}ibid.]
   constant exponents M and N, the calculated GVF length resulted in a
   wider values with a percentage difference ranges from 1.2 to 130\%.
   Hence, a remarkable improvement of the computation of GVF profile length
   is achieved using the derived M(y/d(0)) and N(y/d(0)) exponents.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a new hypothesis which relates the formation of
   sand waves in open flow to the effect of stationary (lee) waves on flow
   with smooth nonhomogeneous downstream depth or behind an obstacle. The
   lee wave moves upstream with the phase velocity equal to the absolute
   value of the flow velocity, hence the wave crest does not move. Results
   of our experiments show that sand waves on the flow bed appear only
   below the lee waves and characteristics of sand waves are determined by
   the wave properties. We investigated the nonlinear stationary waves for
   subcritical and supercritical Froude numbers. These results allow us to
   predict sand waves characteristics for a particular flow. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Transport of inert solutes in two-dimensional bounded heterogeneous
   porous media is investigated in a stochastic framework. After adopting a
   first-order approximation of the flow equations, analytical expressions
   are derived for the velocity covariances. Effects of the boundary
   conditions and aquifer size upon the statistical moments are analyzed.
   While the size of the domain is shown to have small influence on the
   covariances in most cases, the solutions are considerably modified by
   the boundaries. The results are compared with analytical solutions on
   infinite domains, and several discrepancies are demonstrated. For
   example, while the velocity variances on infinite domains are
   homogeneous, the present results are strongly non-stationary. Finally,
   the problem is solved numerically by the Monte Carlo simulation method.
   The results, including the behavior near the boundaries, are shown to be
   in close agreement with analytical solutions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The Laplace Transform Galerkin (LTG) method and the Arnoldi modal
   reduction method (AMRM) have been implemented in finite element schemes
   designed to solve mass transport problems in porous media by Sudicky
   {[}Sudicky, E.A., Water Resour. Res., 25(8) (1989) 1833-46] and Woodbury
   et al {[}Woodbury, A.D., Dunbar, W.S., \& Nour-Omid, B., Water Resour.
   Res., 26(10) (1990) 2579-90]. In this work, a comparative analysis of
   the two methods is performed with attention focused on efficiency and
   accuracy. The analysis is performed over one- and two-dimensional
   domains composed of homogeneous and heterogeneous material properties.
   The results obtained using homogeneous material properties indicate that
   for a given mesh design the LTG method maintains a higher degree of
   accuracy than does the AMRM. However, in terms of efficiency, the
   Arnoldi attains a pre-defined level of accuracy faster than does the LTG
   method. It is also shown that for problems involving homogeneous
   material properties the solution obtained using the LTG method on a
   coarse mesh is comparable in terms of solution time and accuracy to that
   obtained using the AMRM on a fine mesh. Comparisons similar to those
   performed using homogeneous material properties are also performed for
   the case where the hydraulic conductivity field is heterogeneous. For
   this case, the level of accuracy achieved by the AMRM and the LTG method
   are similar. However, as with the analysis involving homogeneous
   material properties, the AMRM is found to be more efficient than the LTG
   method. It is also shown that for heterogeneous material properties, use
   of the LTG method under high grid Peclet conditions can be potentially
   problematic. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.}},

Abstract = {{The transport and fate of reactive chemicals in groundwater is governed
   by equations which are often difficult to solve due to the nonlinear
   relationship between the solute concentrations for the liquid and solid
   phases. The nonlinearity may cause mass balance errors during the
   numerical simulation in addition to numerical errors for linear
   transport system. We have generalized the modified Picard iteration
   algorithm of Celia et al.(5) for unsaturated flow to solve the nonlinear
   transport equation. Written in a `mixed-form' formulation, the total
   solute concentration is expanded in a Taylor series with respect to the
   solution concentration to linearize the transport equation, which is
   then solved with a conventional finite element method. Numerical results
   of this mixed-form algorithm are compared with those obtained with the
   concentration-based scheme using conventional Picard iteration. In
   general, the new solver resulted in negligible mass balance errors
   (<\textbackslash{}10(-8)\textbackslash{}\%) and required less
   computational time than the conventional iteration scheme for the test
   examples, including transport involving highly nonlinear adsorption
   under steady-state as well as transient flow conditions. In contrast,
   mass balance errors resulting from the conventional Picard iteration
   method were higher than 10\% for some highly nonlinear problems.
   Application of the modified Picard iteration scheme to solve the
   nonlinear transport equation may greatly reduce the mass balance errors
   and increase computational efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The results of first-order analyses, based on stochastic continuum
   presentation of unsaturated flow and a general Lagrangian description of
   the transport,(18) are used to assess quantitatively how much
   information about solute spreading in partially saturated heterogeneous
   formations is lost in two-dimensional presentation, when one of the
   horizontal coordinates is suppressed. The main results of this study
   suggest that for formations of given statistics and given soil texture,
   two-dimensional presentation may moderately diminish solute spreading in
   the direction of the mean flow (vertical), and may considerably enhance
   lateral solute spreading as compared with three-dimensional
   presentation, especially in formations of fine-textured soil material
   and/or formations in which log-conductivity horizontal correlation scale
   is small compared with its vertical correlation scale. The results of
   this study may be used for testing and interpretation of results of
   numerical simulations of flow and transport in partially saturated,

   flow domains, formulated as a two-dimensional flow problems. Copyright

Abstract = {{We review the current status of modeling multiphase systems, including
   balance equation formulation, constitutive relations for both
   pressure-saturation-conductivity and interphase mass transfer, and
   stochastic and computational issues. We discuss weaknesses and
   inconsistencies of current approaches based on theoretical,
   computational, and experimental evidence. Where possible, we suggest new
   or evolving approaches. Copyright (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates three phase flow in water-wet porous media. From
   considerations of capillary equilibrium and an analysis of micromodel
   experiments, the pore scale displacement mechanisms are described. The
   stability of layers of NAPL between water and gas has an important
   impact upon the recovery of NAPL to low saturation. The displacement
   mechanisms and the effects of NAPL layers are incorporated into a
   three-dimensional network model. The network model calculates capillary
   pressure, relative permeability, and NAPL recovery. Several types of
   displacement are analyzed by specifying a series of changes in capillary
   pressure. Different capillary pressure paths result in drastically
   different relative permeabilities and NAPL recoveries. In ideal
   circumstances, the ultimate recovery of NAPL can be virtually 100\%, but
   the recovery time is governed by flow through NAPL layers, which is
   shown to be very strongly influenced by the boundary condition at the
   fluid interfaces. The relative permeabilities and capillary pressures we
   calculate cannot be adequately represented by current empirical models.

Abstract = {{To test and evaluate the ability of commonly used constitutive relations
   for multifluid flow predictions, results of numerical flow and transport
   simulations are compared to experimental data. Three quantitative
   experiments were conducted in l-m-long vertical columns. The columns
   were filled with either a uniform sand, a sand with a broad
   particle-size distribution, or with a layered system where a layer of a
   course-textured uniform sand was placed in an otherwise finer-textured
   uniform sand. After establishing variably water-saturated conditions, a
   pulse of a light nonaqueous-phase liquid (LNAPL) was injected uniformly
   at a constant rate. Water and LNAPL saturations were measured as a
   function of time and elevation with a dual-energy gamma-radiation
   system. The infiltration and redistribution of the LNAPL were simulated
   with nonhysteretic and hysteretic parametric relative
   permeability-saturation-pressure (k-S-P) models. The models were
   calibrated using two-phase air-water retention data and an established
   scaling theory. The nonhysteretic Brooks-Corey K-S-P model, which
   utilizes the Burdine relative permeability model, yielded predictions
   that closely matched the experimental data. Use of the nonhysteretic and
   hysteretic k-S-P models, based on the van Genuchten S-P relations and
   k-S relations derived from the Mualem relative permeability model, did
   not agree as well with the experimental data as those obtained with the
   Brooks-Corey k-S-P model. Explanations for the differences in
   performance of the three tested parametric k-S-P models are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical experiments are performed to explore the influence of model

   resolution and the use of alternative fitting functions for capillary

   entrapment, numerical solutions in one-and two-dimensions are strongly
   dependent on grid resolution. Solution convergence tests based upon
   spreading behavior reveal that nodal spacings as small as one-fifth to
   one-tenth of the displacement pressure head may be required to obtain
   reasonable convergence in some simulations. Solutions employing the
   Brooks and Corey and van Genuchten functional forms are found to yield
   different solution behavior. These differences are attributed to the
   representation of capillary pressure below the entry pressure. Brooks
   and Corey solutions exhibited greater spreading, less inclination to
   penetrate semi-permeable layers, and poorer spatial convergence

Abstract = {{In this work, we have applied a group-contribution activity-coefficient
   model, UNIFAC, and the solubility of alcohols in water to estimate
   partition coefficients for alcohol tracers between water and
   nonaqueous-phase liquids (NAPLs). The effects of temperature and mutual
   solubility between NAPL and aqueous phases on the estimation of
   partition coefficients were also investigated. By comparing the
   estimated results with experimental partition coefficients for 30
   alcohol tracers between 10 NAPLs and water, we found that: i) the
   UNIFAC-solubility method, in which the UNIFAC model in its
   infinite-dilution form is applied to the NAPL phase and the solubility
   of tracers in water is used for estimation of the activity coefficient
   in the aqueous phase, works better than the UNIFAC model; ii) a linear
   relation between the logarithm of partition coefficients and the
   logarithm of tracer solubility in water is observed for those tracers
   having a similar chemical structure (i.e. the same number of branched
   methyl groups). This can serve as a useful tool for quick selection of
   the tracers that exhibit the desired partition coefficients; iii) the
   effect of mutual solubility between NAPL and aqueous phases can be
   neglected because such miscibility is very small, usually of the order
   of 10(-3) mole/mole unit; and iv) temperature variation between 15
   degrees and 25 degrees C does not significantly affect partition

Abstract = {{The unsteady free surface flow caused by sudden collapse of a dam
   produces discontinuities in the flow variables. As the flow surges
   downstream, it forms a moving bore front with steep gradients of water
   height and velocity. In the numerical simulation of this flow, proper
   grid distribution can play a crucial part in the prediction and
   resolution of the solutions. The use of presently available numerical
   schemes to solve this problem on a uniform course grid system fails to
   resolve the characteristic how features and hence do a poor job in
   simulating this flow. In this paper, an adaptive grid which adjusts
   itself as the solution evolves is used for a better resolution of the
   flow properties. Rai and Anderson's(12) method is used to determine the
   grid speed; however, a different partial differential equation based on
   the conservative principle of grid are lengths for clustering grids in
   one-dimensional flow is used along with the St. Venant equations to
   numerically simulate the how. Both the subcritical and the supercritical
   hows under extreme boundary conditions are solved using this technique.
   With a specified number of grid points, this provides better quality
   solutions as compared to those obtained with uniformly distributed
   grids. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We extend the finite-volume Eulerian-Lagrangian localized adjoint method
   (FVELLAM) for solution of the advection-dispersion equation to two
   dimensions. The method can conserve mass globally and is not limited by
   restrictions on the size of the grid Peclet or Courant number.
   Therefore, it is well suited for solution of advection-dominated
   ground-water solute transport problems. In test problem comparisons with
   standard finite differences, FVELLAM is able to attain accurate
   solutions on much coarser space and time grids. On fine grids, the
   accuracy of the two methods is comparable, A critical aspect of FVELLAM
   (and all other ELLAMs) is evaluation of the mass storage integral from
   the preceding time level. In FVELLAM this may be accomplished with
   either a forward or backtracking approach. The forward tracking approach
   conserves mass globally and is the preferred approach. The backtracking
   approach is less computationally intensive, but not globally mass
   conservative. Boundary terms are systematically represented as integrals
   in space and time which are evaluated by a common integration scheme in
   conjunction with forward tracking through time. Unlike the
   one-dimensional case, local mass conservation cannot be guaranteed, so
   slight oscillations in concentration can develop, particularly in the
   vicinity of inflow or outflow boundaries. Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This work examines variable density flow and corresponding solute
   transport in groundwater systems. Fluid dynamics of salty solutions with
   significant density variations are of increasing interest in many
   problems of subsurface hydrology. The mathematical model comprises a set
   of non-linear, coupled, partial differential equations to be solved for
   pressure/hydraulic head and mass fraction/concentration of the solute
   component. The governing equations and underlying assumptions are
   developed and discussed. The equation of solute mass conservation is
   formulated in terms of mass fraction and mass concentration. Different
   levels of the approximation of density variations in the mass balance
   equations are used for convection problems (e.g. the Boussinesq
   approximation and its extension, fully density approximation). The
   impact of these simplifications is studied by use of numerical
   modelling.
   Numerical models for nonlinear problems, such as density-driven
   convection, must be carefully verified in a particular series of tests.
   Standard benchmarks for proving variable density flow models are the
   Henry, Elder, and salt dome (HYDROCOIN level 1 case 5) problems. We
   studied these benchmarks using two finite element simulators - ROCKFLOW,
   which was developed at the Institute of Fluid Mechanics and Computer
   Applications in Civil Engineering and FEFLOW, which was developed at the
   Institute for Water Resources Planning and Systems Research Ltd.
   Although both simulators are based on the Galerkin finite element
   method, they differ in many approximation details such as temporal
   discretization (Crank-Nicolson vs predictor-corrector schemes), spatial
   discretization (triangular and quadrilateral elements), finite element
   basis functions (linear, bilinear, biquadratic), iteration schemes
   (Newton, Picard) and solvers (direct, iterative). The numerical analysis
   illustrates discretization effects and defects arising from the
   different levels of the density of approximation. We contribute new
   results for the salt dome problem, for which inconsistent findings exist
   in literature. Applications of the verified numerical models to more
   complex problems, such as thermohaline and three-dimensional convection
   systems, will be presented in the second part of this paper. (C) 1997

Title = {{To be or not to be multi-Gaussian? A reflection on stochastic

Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{The multivariate Gaussian random function model is commonly used in
   stochastic hydrogeology to model spatial variability of
   log-conductivity. The multi-Gaussian model is attractive because it is
   fully characterized by an expected value and a covariance function or
   matrix, hence its mathematical simplicity and easy inference. Field data
   may support a Gaussian univariate distribution for log hydraulic
   conductivity, but, in general, there are not enough field data to
   support a multi-Gaussian distribution. A univariate Gaussian
   distribution does not imply a multi-Gaussian model. In fact, many
   multivariate models can share the same Gaussian histogram and covariance
   function, yet differ by their patterns of spatial continuity at
   different threshold values. Hence the decision to use a multi-Gaussian
   model to represent the uncertainty associated with the spatial
   heterogeneity of log-conductivity is not databased. Of greatest concern
   is the fact that a multi-Gaussian model implies the minimal spatial
   correlation of extreme values, a feature critical for mass transport and
   a feature that may be in contradiction with some geological settings,
   e.g. channeling. The possibility for high conductivity values to be
   spatially correlated should not be discarded by adopting a congenial
   model just because data shortage prevents refuting it. In this study,
   three alternatives to a multi-Gaussian model, all sharing the same
   Gaussian histogram and the same covariance function, but with different
   continuity patterns for extreme values, were considered to model the
   spatial variability of log-conductivity. The three alternative models,
   plus the traditional multi-Gaussian model, are used to perform Monte
   Carlo analyses of groundwater travel times from a hypothetical nuclear
   repository to the ground surface through a synthetic formation similar
   to the Finnsjon site in Sweden. The results show that the groundwater
   travel times predicted by the multi-Gaussian model could be ten times
   slower than those predicted by the other models. The probabilities of
   very short travel times could be severely underestimated using the
   multi-Gaussian model. Consequently, if field measured data are not
   sufficient to determine the higher-order moments necessary to validate

Abstract = {{The general situation in which the mean gradient vector, J, is not
   necessarily aligned in a direction perpendicular to the bedding of a
   partially saturated heterogeneous formation, is considered. Previous
   results of first-order analyses, based on a stochastic continuum
   presentation of unsaturated flow and a general Lagrangian description of
   the transport(15) and standard tensor transformation relationships, were
   used to evaluate the orientation of the principal axes of the asymptotic
   macrodispersion tensor as a function of the inclination of J, and to
   assess its impact on solute spreading in partially saturated
   heterogeneous formations of three-dimensional anisotropic structure. The
   main results obtained in this study suggest that under unsaturated flow,
   for given statistics of the formation properties and given mean water
   saturation, and when the inclination of J is relatively small,
   coarse-textured soil material with negligibly small capillary forces may
   compensate for the enhanced lateral displacement (in the same direction
   as that of J relative to the longitudinal axis of the formation
   heterogeneity) and the enhanced lateral spreading of the solute plume
   due to increasing anisotropy (smaller e = I-yv/I-yh where I-yv and I-yh
   are the correlation length scales of log-unsaturated conductivity in the
   vertical (longitudinal) and horizontal directions, respectively). On the
   other hand, when the inclination of J is relatively large, such soil
   material may enhance lateral displacement of the solute plume in a
   direction opposite to that of J relative to the longitudinal axis of the
   formation heterogeneity. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   calculate the equivalent permeability of a heterogeneous porous medium.
   It shows how equivalence is defined by using a criterion of flow or of
   the energy dissipated by viscous forces and explains the two different

Abstract = {{A semi-analytical method has been developed for calculating oil recovery
   in two and three dimensions, and for calculating effective relative
   permeabilities for coarse grids. The calculations are based on the
   assumption that the effects of a changing mobility held can be accounted
   for by using fixed streamtube geometries with flowrates updated to
   account for the changing mobility distribution. The single-phase
   pressure distribution from a numerical solution of Laplace's equation is
   used to calculate the pressure distribution for a two-phase flow based
   on a mapping of the solution of the Buckley-Leverett equation onto the
   streamtubes derived from the single-phase solution. The displacement
   calculations for oil recovery are based on theory previously developed
   by Dykstra and Parsons, extended to include the effects of spatially
   varying permeability and continuously changing mobilities, as occurs in
   solutions of the Buckley-Leverett equation for typical values of the
   mobility ratio. This idea has also been extended to the calculation of
   effective relative permeabilities for coarse-grid simulation and finally
   establishes the proper rules for averaging the results of fine-grid
   numerical simulations of two-phase flow for the definition of effective
   two-phase flow properties on coarse grids. These calculations have been
   generalized to three-dimensional flows by the simple device of
   conceptually inserting a gridded plane across the flow and defining each
   streamtube at that location as those streamlines which pass through any
   one of the grid cells. When combined with time-of-flight calculations
   from the gridded plane to both the producer and injector, the
   distribution of pore volume along each streamtube can be calculated.
   This information, combined with a tabulation of the single-phase,
   steady-state pressure distribution along each streamtube, provides all
   of the information needed for the semi-analytical calculation of oil
   recovery and effective flow properties in three-dimensional flows. (C)

   incomplete characterization of the hydraulic conductivity, chemical

   theory involving nonlocal dispersive and convective Fluxes and nonlocal
   sources/sinks is developed for chemicals undergoing random linear
   nonequilibrium reactions and random equilibrium first-order decay in a
   random conductivity field. The resulting transport equations are solved
   exactly in Fourier-Laplace space and then numerically inverted to real
   space. Mean concentration contours and various spatial moments are
   presented graphically for several covariance structures. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Solute plume spreading in an aquifer exhibits a `scale effect' if the
   second spatial concentration moment of a plume has a non-constant
   time-derivative. Stochastic approaches to modeling this scale effect
   often rely on the critical assumption that ensemble averages can be
   equated to spatial averages measured in a single field experiment. This
   ergodicity assumption should properly be evaluated in a strictly
   dynamical context, and this is done in the present paper. For the
   important case of trace plume convection by steady groundwater flow in
   an isotropic, heterogeneous aquifer, ergodicity does not obtain because
   of the existence of an invariant function on stream surfaces that is not
   uniform throughout the aquifer. The implications of this result for
   stochastic models of solute transport are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Randomness is an essential feature for groundwater ecology and fluid
   turbulence. The scale-up problem refers to the situation in which the
   randomness occurs on all scales. Classical dispersion theories are not
   applicable in this situation due to the coupling between adjacent length
   scales. The difficulty in theoretical formulations lies in the closure
   problem - namely, the higher order random quantities emerge in the
   derivations for the dynamical equations of the lower order random
   quantities. In this paper, we consider tracer particles driven by a
   Gaussian random velocity field. We develop a renormalized perturbation
   expansion method for this problem. Our theory shows that the effective
   dispersivity has very complicated structures. We introduce a pairwise
   time ordering approximation to derive an approximate expression for a
   local diffusion operator. Under this approximation, we develop a
   multi-length-scale theory which gives analytical predictions for the
   effective diffusion coefficient and for the size of the mixing region
   along with its scaling exponent. Our theory has no adjustable parameter.
   The quantitative theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with
   the results from full numerical simulations. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A general method for the scale-up of highly detailed, heterogeneous,
   cross sectional flow models to coarser scales is developed and applied.
   The technique involves the nonuniform coarsening of the detailed
   description, with finer resolution introduced in regions of potentially
   high fluid velocities (typically regions of connected, high
   permeability) and coarse, homogenized descriptions applied to the
   remainder of the flow domain. The method is designed to capture both
   average behavior as well as some important behaviors which are due to
   the high extremes of the permeability field, such as the breakthrough of
   the displacing fluid. The method is applied to several example problems,
   including two actual oil field examples, and is shown to provide
   coarsened models (similar to 25 x 25) which give simulation results for
   fractional flows and saturations in close agreement with fine scale
   (similar to 100 x 100) results. These examples demonstrate the ability
   of the method to capture a wide variety of flow behavior without the
   need for specific knowledge of the global flow held, indicating that the
   coarsened description of the formation is, to a large degree, process
   independent. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An indirect approach to the estimation of parameters of log-unsaturated
   conductivity (logK) covariance may be based on an inverse problem
   methodology, employing measurements of the response of the transport
   domain. In the present investigation, we analyzed the feasibility of
   estimating parameters of the logK covariance by inversion of an
   approximate solution of the transport problem under unsaturated flow
   conditions, employing the spatial moments of the plume of a tracer
   solute, at various travel times, as input data. The study focused on the
   question of circumstances under which the resulting inverse problem is
   well posed. Results of the analyses suggest that inclusion of prior
   estimates of the covariance parameters in the estimation criterion
   enhances the likelihood of uniqueness and stability of the inverse
   solution. The sufficient condition for uniqueness and stability, the
   convexity of the estimation criterion in the parameter space, however,
   cannot be guaranteed in all cases. In recognition of the importance of
   prior information on the uniqueness and stability of the inverse
   solution, a theoretical framework for the determination of prior
   estimates of the parameters from the small and large time behavior of
   the plume is described in this paper. An example involving simulated
   transport of a pulse of a tracer solute by a quasi-steady-state,
   unsaturated flow was used for illustration purposes. Results of the
   analyses of this example show that the inclusion of a prior estimate of
   a single parameter, the anisotropy ratio, e (that may be obtained from
   the small-time behavior of the plume) in the estimation criterion, may
   significantly reduce the uncertainty about the covariance parameters, as
   compared with the case in which no prior information on the parameters
   was considered. Controlled field-scale experiments and Monte-Carlo
   simulations are required, in order to test the findings of this study
   further before practical tools for the solution of the estimation
   problem can be provided. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{A new procedure is presented to obtain exact solutions to groundwater
   how problems with free boundaries in the vertical plane. The solution
   procedure makes use of the hodograph method in combination with
   conformal mapping. The complex discharge function and the reference
   function are used as auxiliary functions. The function that maps the
   upper half plane onto the domain in the complex discharge plane is
   obtained by integration of the differential equation of Schwarz. The
   final solution is a linear combination of infinite series and consists
   of two functions: the conformal map of the upper half plane onto the
   physical plane and onto the complex potential plane. As an example, the
   problem of how over a horizontal base to a straight seepage face is
   solved. Flow nets are presented for two inclinations of the seepage face
   and rules are derived for the specification of boundary conditions along
   seepage faces in Dupuit-Forchheimer models. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The time and scale dependence of the retardation factor is examined for
   transport of a linearly adsorbing solute in an aquifer with spatially
   variable distribution coefficient (K-d). The variability of ln K-d and
   the logarithm of the hydraulic conductivity (ln K) are modeled as
   stationary random fields. Two definitions of the effective retardation
   factor are introduced: (i) the ratio of the ensemble average centroid
   velocities of a passive and retarded solute and (ii) the ratio of the
   ensemble average arrival time of a passive solute to that of a retarded
   solute. The effective retardation factor based on the first definition
   is shown to be time-dependent and that based on the second definition is
   shown to be distance (scale) dependent. Theoretical expressions are
   developed for computing the effective retardation factors based on a
   knowledge of statistical parameters of the In K and ln K-d fields.
   Illustrative computations are presented for one-dimensional and
   three-dimensional heterogeneous media. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Title = {{Influence of the regularization weighting matrix on parameter estimates}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{231-247}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Optimization techniques are often used in parameter estimation. An
   objective function can be formed with a measurement term and
   regularization term. The measurement term is formed from the weighted
   sum of squares of the difference between head measurements and their
   computed values. The regularization term is formed by the weighted sum
   of squares of departures from the original parameter estimates. Most
   often, a diagnonal regularization weighting matrix is used. A diagonal
   matrix corresponds to an assumption of no spatial correlation between
   the errors in the original parameter estimates, but the errors will most
   often be correlated. Consequently, non-diagonal weighting matrices
   should be used. Numerical experiments have been performed to test the
   influence of nondiagonal regularization weighting matrices on parameter
   estimates. It is demonstrated that using the correct structure for the
   weighting matrix can improve transmissivity estimates. The
   transmissivity fields computed from the non-diagonal weighting matrices
   are closer in statistical structure and more accurate than those
   computed with diagnonal weighting matrices, and the connectivity of the
   extreme values is more accurately imaged. The use of nondiagonal
   weighting matrices can improve the computed flow field, and, therefore,
   the accuracy of transport simulations. The results indicate that using
   the correct weighting can improve transmissivity estimates more
   effectively than adding many new observation points. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{For the diffusive transport through a two-phase material, a two-equation
   model must be used when the contrast between the thermal properties of
   the medium becomes so high that local equilibrium cannot be achieved.
   Using the volume averaging approach an unsteady-state closure is
   investigated, which leads to expression of a phase exchange term and
   conductive terms as temporal convolutions. Two application examples are
   studied, layered material and cylindrical particles embedded in a
   continuous phase. The results of the one-equation model, the
   two-equation models with a steady-state closure and an unsteady-state
   closure are compared. Surprisingly, in most cases, the steady-state
   closure gives satisfactory results. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper reviews recent work by the authors involving nonconservative
   convective-conductive internal energy transport phenomena in porous
   media. Where appropriate, these heat-transfer results are contrasted and
   compared with their classical mass-transfer counterparts. Commonalities
   as well as differences are pointed out, arising from the distinction
   between molecular diffusivity vs thermal diffusivity. Differences raise
   from the fact that the latter - in contrast with the former - is a
   composite material property (derived jointly from separate thermal
   conductivity and volumetric heat capacity properties). This contrasts
   with the case of molecular diffusivity, which is a fundamental rather
   than composite material property.
   Both adiabatic and nonadiabatic systems are studied, with the latter
   characterized by a rate of heat loss to the surroundings described by a
   `Newton's law of cooling' heat transfer coefficient, h. Taylor
   dispersion theory is used to effect the coarse-graining of the thermal
   problem posed by the microscale equations, thereby producing a
   macroscale or effective-medium theory of the mean thermal transport
   process. Various porous media, each possessing a spatially periodic
   skeletal geometry, are analyzed. General expressions are presented for
   the macroscale thermal propagation velocity vector (U) over bar{*}
   (which is not generally equal to the interstitial Darcy-scale velocity
   (V) over bar{*} of the flowing fluid) and effective thermal dispersivity
   dyadic alpha{*} in terms of the prescribed microsdale data.
   Additionally, in the nonadiabatic case, an expression is obtained for a
   third macrotransport coefficient, (H) over bar{*}, representing the
   effective or overall macroscale heat-transfer coefficient, and distinct
   from the microscale heat-transfer coefficient h. (The former,
   macrotransport coefficient represents the same type of macroscale
   material property as arises in so-called `fin' heat-transfer problems.)
   Futhermore, it is shown that when solving the transient nonadiabatic
   microtransport equation for the mean temperature T, parameterized by the
   effective-medium phenomenological coefficients (H) over bar{*}, (U) over
   bar{*} and alpha{*}, it becomes necessary to employ a fictitious mean
   initial temperature distribution in place of the true mean distribution,
   the latter deriving from the initial microscale distribution. A paradigm
   is outlined for calculating this fictitious mean initial temperature
   held from the prescribed initial microscale temperature field.
   One illustrative example addressed is that of heat conduction in a
   quiescent composite medium. Specifically, we show that although a
   composite:medium may be composed of two separately homogeneous
   materials, each possessing identical (and isotropic) thermal
   diffusivities alpha, the effective thermal dispersivity alpha{*} of the
   composite medium may nevertheless differ from the constant diffusivity
   alpha characterizing the individual phases by many orders of magnitude;
   moreover, in contrast to the scalar, isotropic nature of the individual
   microscale diffusivities alpha the effective macroscale dispersivity
   alpha{*} will generally be anisotropic, possessing a value dependent
   upon which (if either) of the two homogeneous phases is continuous and
   which is discontinuous!
   Detailed results are also summarized for the effective thermal
   dispersivity dyadic for two-dimensional homogeneous Darcy flow through
   the interstices of a packed bed composed of circular cylinders in
   various lattice configurations. In the adiabatic fluid case
   (corresponding to the cylinders being insulated), results for (U) over
   bar{*} and alpha{*} are given for the effective thermal dispersivities
   in terms of the Peclet number, bed porosities and, where relevant,
   Reynolds number (Re). While most of the numerical data pertain to the
   Stokes flow case, Re = 0, a few calculations at Reynolds numbers up to
   about 100 are also presented.
   In the comparable nonadiabatic case (corresponding to noninsulated
   circular cylinders functioning as heat sources or sinks), numerical
   results are also presented for the Darcy-scale thermophysical parameters
   (H) over bar{*}, (U) over bar{*} and alpha{*}. In addition to providing
   numerical values for (H) over bar{*} in terms of the pertinent
   microscale phenomenological data, these calculations show that (U) over
   bar{*} and alpha{*} for nonadiabatic systems may differ sensibly from
   their adiabatic counterparts, as they now also depend functionally upon
   the heat transfer coefficient h. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{The theory of homogenization, which is a rigorous method of averaging
   based on multiple-scale perturbation expansions, is applied to thermal
   consolidation in two-scale porous media. Starting from the basic
   conservation laws on the microscale, we derive the linear macroscale
   governing equations and constitutive coefficients for sufficiently small
   solid displacements. Several canonical microcell boundary value problems
   are defined for the computation of the effective coefficients. By
   extending Auriault \& Sanchez-Palencia(2), we deduce certain properties
   of and relations among the macroscale coefficients. We also outline the
   results for the case when the medium deformation is comparable to
   typical grain size. The governing equations are then coupled nonlinearly
   due to the movement of the fluid-solid interfaces. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{In Lee \& Mei(7) the macroscale equations for thermal consolidation in a
   periodic porous medium have been derived by homogenization theory. Here
   the macroscale coefficients are calculated for a cubic array of
   Wigner-Seitz grains. We first show that the elastic coefficient tensor
   of rank four has only three distinct constants and all the second rank
   tensor coefficients are isotropic. The canonical boundary cell problem
   for the elasticity tenser is then replaced by a variational principle,
   which is used as the basis for three-dimensional finite element
   computation. The dependence of the macroscale coefficients on the
   porosity is examined by varying an aspect ratio of the Wigner-Seitz
   cell. It is shown that the effective elastic coefficients and thermal
   modulus decrease with porosity whereas the pressure coefficient
   increases with porosity. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Soil venting is a widely used technique to remediate unsaturated soils
   contaminated with organic contaminants. A fundamental concern in the
   remedial design is to predict the performance of the venting system in
   terms of the contaminant vapor removal rates and the clean-up limits
   that can be achieved at a site. In this paper, a mass transport model to
   simulate the evaporation of nonaqueous phase contaminants from the
   unsaturated soil during venting is presented. In particular, the
   dependence of NAPL evaporation on the resistance due to diffusional
   transport within the liquid phase is discussed in detail. Various
   limiting mechanisms that control the contaminant removal from NAPL phase
   have been identified. Results from numerical simulations have indicated
   that interfacial concentration can be overpredicted by models employing
   complete mixing assumption when the mass transfer coefficients are high
   and the interface transfer rates are limited by the diffusional
   transport within the liquid layer. Venting scenarios were simulated
   using a multi-component numerical model in which diffusional resistance
   in the liquid layer was included. The predicted vapor concentrations in
   the outlet air have been found to be in good comparison with
   experimental data. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Radiation heat transport through the internal void spaces of particle
   beds, fiber beds, packed beds, reactors and porous media with opaque,
   diffusely reflecting, gray body surfaces and large solid dimensions (pi
   d/lambda(th) > 100) is considered. A variational principle formulated
   for the effective radiation conductivity, based on the local particle
   surface radiosity, differential view factor and solid temperature,
   permits a rigorous solution of the dependent, long range multiple
   scattering problem. The conductivity results, applied to a bed of
   randomly overlapping spheres, agree exactly with pseudohomogeneous
   results in both the isotropic and anisotropic scattering limits and shed
   rigorous light on the anisotropic phase function expansion theory.
   Explicit calculations, performed for several other standard packings,
   e.g. fiber beds, exhibit a parallel upper and series lower bound over
   the various particle shapes and dispersion structures. Results show that
   an empirical equation first suggested by Vortmeyer (German Chem. Engng,
   3, (1980) 124-137), but generalized herein from one P to four P-0, P-1,
   P-2, P-3 coefficients, which vary substantially with the various

Abstract = {{The pressure-head form of Richards' equation (RE) is difficult to solve
   accurately using standard time integration methods. For example, mass
   balance errors grow as the integration progresses unless very small time
   steps are taken. Further, RE may be solved for many problems more
   economically and robustly with variable-size time steps rather than with
   a constant time-step size, but variable step-size methods applied to
   date have relied upon empirical approaches to control step size, which
   do not explicitly control temporal truncation error of the solution. We
   show how a differential algebraic equation implementation of the method
   of lines can give solutions to RE that are accurate, have good mass
   balance properties, explicitly control temporal truncation error, and
   are more economical than standard approaches for a wide range of
   solution accuracy. We detail changes to a standard integrator, DASPK,
   that improves efficiency for the test problems considered, and we
   advocate the use of this approach for both RE and other problems
   involving subsurface flow and transport phenomena. Copyright (C) 1996

Abstract = {{Sink and source combinations were used to simulate flow around barriers
   such as might exist within a stony, unsaturated soil system. Although
   more complicated than two-dimensional cases which were previously
   presented, the three-dimensional `'Rankine bodies'' are more appropriate
   for simulating flow around real objects. Generally, the appropriate
   potentials and velocity fields are easy to write down and evaluate, in
   fact, much easier than the alternative solutions based on scattering
   theory. Also, arrays of bodies can be arranged to simulate a repeated
   pattern rather than deal with only single barriers, cavities, etc.
   However, the shapes of the bodies are not known ahead of time and can
   only be roughly controlled. For the same Darcian flow, a simulated stony
   layer was shown to be wetter than that without stones and the effective
   saturated conductivity reduced somewhat less than 1 - f(s) where f(s) is
   the fraction of stones. Overall there is a qualitative agreement with
   previous theoretical and experimental results for both saturated and
   unsaturated flow. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{It is well documented that the direct solution of the primitive equation
   form (PE) of the shallow-water equations by conventional Galerkin finite
   elements fails to control numerical noise. While some alternative
   numerical techniques applied directly to the primitive equations have
   been successfully developed, a reformulation of the fundamental
   equations into the generalized wave continuity equation form (GWCE)
   provides an alternative noise-free procedure that has been used in
   numerous held applications. The selection of penalty parameter, `G' for
   GWCE must, however, be carefully adjusted to achieve both mass balance
   and noise control. In this paper, a numerical method for solving the
   primitive equation with a filter is presented. It is shown that a
   filtered primitive equation method (FPE) controls numerical noise and is
   mass conservative. Since the FPE method derives its basis from
   observations about the behavior of GWCE, we present comparisons of the
   solution of the primitive equations via FPE with the solution of the
   wave equation via the GWCE form. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{37-43}},

Abstract = {{In order to model recent observations of groundwater dynamics in
   beaches, a system of equations is derived for the propagation of
   periodic watertable waves in unconfined aquifers of intermediate depths,
   i.e. for finite values of the dimensionless aquifer depth n omega d/K
   which is assumed small under the Dupuit-Forchheimer approach that leads
   to the Boussinesq equation. Detailed consideration is given to equations
   of second- and infinite-order in this parameter. In each case, small
   amplitude (eta/d much less than 1) as well as finite amplitude versions
   are discussed. The small amplitude equations have solutions of the form
   eta(x, t) = eta(0)e(-kx)e(i omega t) in analogy with the linearized
   Boussinesq equation but the complex wave numbers k are different. These
   new wave numbers compare well with observations from a Hele-Shaw cell
   which were previously unexplained. The `'exact'' velocity potential for
   small amplitude watertable waves, the equivalent of Airy waves, is
   presented. These waves show a number of remarkable features. They become
   non-dispersive in the short-wave limit with a finite and quite slow
   decay rate affording an explanation for observed behaviour of
   wave-induced porewater pressure fluctuations in beaches. They also show
   an increasing amplitude of pressure fluctuations towards the base, in
   analogy with the evanescent modes of linear surface gravity waves.

Title = {{A multistep constant-head borehole test to determine field saturated
   hydraulic conductivity of layered soils}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-57}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Although most held soils are heterogeneous, existing analytical
   solutions to estimate field saturated hydraulic conductivity K-fs in
   unsaturated systems assume that the soil is homogeneous. To overcome the
   limitations of existing analytical solutions we propose a multistep
   constant head borehole test to evaluate the field saturated hydraulic
   conductivity of layered media. The field test consists of conducting
   constant head borehole tests at different depths that correspond to the
   different layers in the soil. Measurements of water level and the stable
   flow rate are then used to compute the hydraulic conductivity of each
   layer. Equations for evaluating the saturated conductivity of each layer
   are derived. To determine the how contribution of each layer, a new
   pressure solution is also presented. One of the assumptions of the
   proposed analytical solution is that the pressure gradient on the
   borehole wall of each layer is independent of the hydraulic conductivity
   of the layer. Comparison of analytical results with numerical simulation
   results show that this assumption is reasonable. The proposed analytical
   procedure can be used to calculate both the saturated and unsaturated
   how components. For deep boreholes with large H/a ratios (greater than
   or equal to 20; H constant depth of water; a borehole radius) the effect
   of unsaturated how on the estimated field saturated hydraulic
   conductivity can be neglected and only one borehole is required.
   However, for shallow boreholes (H/a < 20), the unsaturated dow component
   is not negligible and can be estimated by drilling two nearby boreholes
   of different radii. Field test results are provided to demonstrate the
   application of the proposed method using deep boreholes in an arid
   setting. Constant-head borehole rests were repeated at different depths,
   depending on the number of layers in the system. This test provides a
   method to determine the vertical distribution of hydraulic conductivity
   for layered soils which is important for accurate evaluation of
   subsurface flow and contaminant transport. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The geostatistical approach to the inverse problem is discussed with
   emphasis on the importance of structural analysis. Although the
   geostatistical approach is occasionally misconstrued as mere cokriging,
   in fact it consists of two steps: estimation of statistical parameters
   (''structural analysis'') followed by estimation of the distributed
   parameter conditional on the observations (''cokriging'' or `'weighted
   least squares''). It is argued that in inverse problems, which are
   algebraically undetermined, the challenge is not so much to reproduce
   the data as to select an algorithm with the prospect of giving good
   estimates where there are no observations. The essence of the
   geostatistical approach is that instead of adjusting a grid-dependent
   and potentially large number of block conductivities (or other
   distributed parameters), a small number of structural parameters are
   fitted to the data. Once this fitting is accomplished, the estimation of
   block conductivities ensues in a predetermined fashion without fitting
   of additional parameters. Also, the methodology is compared with a
   straightforward maximum a posteriori probability estimation method. It
   is shown that the fundamental differences between the two approaches
   are: (a) they use different principles to separate the estimation of
   covariance parameters from the estimation of the spatial variable; (b)
   the method for covariance parameter estimation in the geostatistical
   approach produces statistically unbiased estimates of the parameters
   that are not strongly dependent on the discretization, while the other
   method is biased and its bias becomes worse by refining the
   discretization into zones with different conductivity. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The structure of macroporous or aggregated soils and fractured rocks is
   generally so complex that it is impractical to measure the geometry at
   the microscale (i.e., the size and the shape of soil aggregates or rock
   matrix blocks, and the myriad of fissures or fractures), and use such
   data in geometry-dependent macroscale flow and transport models. This
   paper analyzes a first-order type dual-porosity model which contains a
   geometry-dependent coefficient, beta, in the mass transfer term to
   macroscopically represent the size and shape of soil or rock matrix
   blocks. As a reference, one- and two-dimensional geometry-based
   diffusion models were used to simulate mass transport into and out of
   porous blocks of defined shapes. Estimates for beta were obtained
   analytically for four different matrix block geometries. Values for beta
   were also calculated by directly matching analytical solutions of the
   diffusion models for a number of selected matrix block geometries to
   results obtained with the first-order model assuming standard boundary
   conditions, Direct matching improved previous results for cylindrical
   macropore geometries, especially when relatively small ratios between
   the outer soil mantle and the radius of the inner cylinder were used,
   Results of our analysis show that beta is closely related to the ratio
   of the effective surface area available for mass transfer, and the soil
   matrix volume normalized by the effective characteristic length of the
   matrix system. Using values of beta obtained by direct matching, an
   empirical function is derived to estimate macroscopic geometry
   coefficients from medium properties which in principle are measurable.
   The method permits independent estimates of beta, thus allowing the
   dual-porosity approach eventually to be applied to media with complex
   and mixed types of structural geometry. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by

Abstract = {{Numerical dispersion, numerical oscillation, and peak clipping are
   common numerical difficulties in solving advection-dispersion equations.
   The development of numerical approaches that can handle these numerical
   difficulties with reasonable computational efforts is an ongoing
   challenge. In this paper, an interpolation-corrected modified method of
   characteristics (ICMMOC) is proposed for solving advection-dispersion
   equations. The ICMMOC is an improved version of the modified method of
   characteristics (MMOC). It uses a high-order (second-order or higher)
   interpolation scheme to reduce numerical dispersion and an
   interpolation-correction procedure to eliminate numerical oscillation. A
   simple peak capturing scheme to overcome the peak clipping problem is
   also developed in this study. Simulation results show that the ICMMOC is
   able to overcome the aforementioned numerical difficulties for a large
   range of grid Peclet numbers. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of contaminant concentration at a hazardous waste site
   typically vary over many orders of magnitude and have highly skewed
   distributions. This work presents a practical methodology for the
   estimation of solute concentration contour maps and volume averages
   (needed for mass calculations) from data obtained from the analysis of
   water and soil samples. The methodology, which is an extension of linear
   geostatistics, produces a point estimate, i.e., a representative value,
   as well as a confidence interval, which contains the true value with a
   given probability. The approach uses a parsimonious model that accounts
   for the skewness by adding only one parameter to those used in linear
   geostatistics (variograms or generalized covariances). The resulting
   nonlinear kriging method is not substantially more difficult to use than
   linear geostatistics. The methodology is most appropriate when
   concentration measurements are available on a reasonably dense grid and
   no additional information (based on modeling dow and transport) can be
   used. We present and illustrate through an application, a practical
   approach to estimate all the parameters needed and to select and test
   the model. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd}},

   the two-step split-operator method in which the transport and reaction
   steps are performed separately. Operator splitting, however, does not
   solve exactly the fully coupled numerical model derived from the
   governing partial differential and algebraic equations describing the
   transport and reaction processes. An error, proportional to Delta t (the
   time step used in the numerical solution) is introduced. Thus, small
   time steps must be used to ensure that accurate solutions result. An
   alternative scheme is presented, which iterates to the exact solution of
   the fully coupled numerical model. The new scheme enables accurate
   solutions to be calculated more efficiently than the two-step method,
   while maintaining separation of the transport and reaction steps in the
   calculations. As in the two-step method, the reaction calculations are
   performed node-wise throughout the computation grid. However, because
   the scheme relies on LU factorisation of the coefficient matrix in the
   transport equation solution, the reaction calculations must be performed
   in sequence, the sequence order being determined by the ordering of the
   nodes in the grid. Also, because LU factorisation is used, the scheme is
   limited to solute transport problems for which LU factorisation is a
   practical solution method. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited}},

Abstract = {{A probabilistic model of groundwater contaminant transport is presented.
   The model is based on coupling first- and second-order reliability
   methods (FORM and SORM) with a two-dimensional finite element solution
   of groundwater transport equations. Uncertainty in aquifer media is
   considered by modeling hydraulic conductivity as a spatial random held
   with a prescribed correlation structure. FORM and SORM provide the
   probability that a contaminant exceeds a target level at a well, termed
   the probability of failure. Sensitivity of the probability of failure to
   basic variabilities in grid block conductivity is also obtained, at no
   additional computational effort. The effect of the choice of the
   predetermined target level at the observation well is provided, along
   with its effect on the relevant sensitivity information. Considerable
   saving in computational time was achieved by superimposing a coarse
   random variables mesh on a finer numerical mesh. The presence of regions
   of lower conductivity on the probabilistic event is analyzed, and the
   regions in which conductivity most affects the results are identified.

Abstract = {{The contamination of groundwater by various hazardous materials has
   emerged as a primary environmental issue. The pollution of oil
   reservoirs is a closely related problem in that microorganisms are
   involved in the contaminant process. The mathematical models that
   describe these phenomena involve a set of nonlinear
   advective-diffusive-reactive transport equations, which may involve
   reactions with all of the species and are themselves coupled to growth
   equations for the subsurface bacterial populations. In this article, we
   discuss and compare different mathematical models, present
   Eulerian-Lagrangian localized adjoint methods (ELLAM) and combine them
   with specific linearization techniques to solve these nonlinear
   transport systems. The derived numerical schemes systematically adapt to
   the changing features of governing equations. The relative importance of
   advection, diffusion and reaction is directly incorporated into the
   schemes by judicious choice of the test functions in the variational
   formulations. Numerical experiments are presented to show the potential
   of these methods. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited}},

Abstract = {{A new lumped-parameter approach to simulating unsaturated flow processes
   in dual-porosity media such as fractured rocks or aggregated soils is
   presented. Fluid flow between the fracture network and the matrix blocks
   is described by a non-linear equation that relates the imbibition rate
   to the local difference in liquid-phase pressure between the fractures
   and the matrix blocks. Unlike a Warren-Root-type equation, this equation
   is accurate in both the early and late time regimes. The fracture/matrix
   interflow equation has been incorporated into an existing unsaturated
   flow simulator, to serve as a source/sink term for fracture gridblocks.
   Flow processes are then simulated using only fracture gridblocks in the
   computational grid. This new lumped-parameter approach has been tested
   on two problems involving transient flow in fractured/porous media, and
   compared with simulations performed using explicit discretisation of the
   matrix blocks. The new procedure seems to accurately simulate flow
   processes in unsaturated fractured rocks, and typically requires an
   order of magnitude less computational time than do simulations using
   fully-discretised matrix blocks. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This study deals with a method to solve the transport equations for a
   kinetically adsorbing solute in a porous medium with spatially varying
   velocity field and dispersion coefficients. Making use of the stochastic
   nature of a first-order kinetic process, we show that the
   advection-dispersion equation and the adsorption isotherm can be
   decoupled. Once the solution for a non-adsorbing solute is known, the
   method provides an exact solution for the kinetically adsorbing solute.
   The method is worked out in four examples. In particular we demonstrate
   how the method can be applied simultaneously with a numerical transport
   code: the advective-dispersive transport is computed numerically,
   whereas kinetic effects are incorporated analytically. The proposed
   approach may be useful in field scale applications with complex flow
   patterns. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited}},

Abstract = {{It is shown that from any solution of the linear diffusion equation, we
   may construct a solution of a realistic form of the Richards equation
   for unsaturated flow. Compared to the usual direct linearization method,
   our inverse approach involves a quite different sequence of
   transformations. This opens the possibility of exact solutions with a
   wider variety of continuously varying flux boundary conditions.
   Closed-form solutions are presented for two examples. In these, the
   varying water flux boundary conditions resemble (i) the passage of a
   peaking storm and (ii) the continuous opening of a valve preceding a
   steady water supply. Unlike earlier more systematic approaches to this
   problem, our method does not require the numerical solution of an
   integral equation. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Limited}},

Abstract = {{In groundwater modeling the identification of an optimal flow or
   transport parameter that varies spatially should include both the values
   and structure of the parameter. However, most existing techniques for
   parameter identification only consider the parameter values. In this
   study, the problem of identifying optimal parameter structure is treated
   as a large combinatorial optimization problem. Two recently developed
   heuristic search techniques, simulated annealing and tabu search, are
   used to solve the large combinatorial optimization problem. The
   effectiveness and flexibility of these two techniques are evaluated and
   compared with simple grid search and descent search, using preliminary
   results from one-dimensional examples. Among the techniques examined in
   this paper, tabu search performs extremely well in terms of the total
   number of function evaluations required. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by

Title = {{Comparison of solution approaches for the two-domain model of
   nonequilibrium transport in porous media}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{241-253}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The two-domain concept is widely used in modelling transport in
   heterogeneous porous media and transport of rate-limited sorbing
   contaminants. When a first-order kinetic relationship is used to
   represent the transfer of mass between domains, the model can be
   expressed as a modified advection-dispersion equation describing general
   transport coupled to a first-order ordinary differential equation
   accounting for mass transfer. Different approaches can be used to solve
   the resulting system, including: simultaneously solving the coupled
   transport and kinetic equations; discretising and algebraically solving
   the mass transfer equation and substituting it into the transport
   equation; solving the mass transfer equation analytically and
   substituting the integral solution into the transport equation to obtain
   a single integro-differential equation; and solving the system in
   Laplace space and back-transforming the solution into the time domain.
   These four approaches - coupled, algebraic substitution,
   integro-differential, and finite element Laplace transform (FELT) - are
   evaluated on the basis of their general features and on their
   performance in two test cases. The results indicate that the algebraic
   substitution approach is robust and, on scalar computers, very
   efficient. The FELT approach is easily parallelised and achieves good
   speed-up on supercomputers, but the method is restricted to
   time-invariant velocity and saturation fields, and is only useful for
   obtaining the solution at or not too far from the maximum simulation
   time. The integro-differential method is as efficient as but less robust
   than the algebraic substitution approach, requiring a small time step
   size when the mass transfer coefficient is very large. Finally, the
   coupled approach is robust and flexible, but requires the solution of a
   system of equations twice as large as the other methods. On balance, the
   algebraic substitution and, to a lesser extent, the integro-differential
   methods appear to be the most attractive approaches on scalar machines
   while FELT, when applicable, is an appealing alternative for
   coarse-grained multiprocessors. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Shallow-water flows with supercritical and subcritical subregions often
   exhibit numerical difficulties because of their associated hydraulic
   jumps (shock waves), steep layers, and fictitious oscillations.
   Analogous problems in gas dynamics have led to the recent development of
   a promising class of Petrov-Galerkin methods specifically designed for
   hyperbolic/incompletely parabolic systems, and are written in a
   symmetric conservation form. One of the major difficulties in the
   application of this class of methods to shallow water problems has been
   the unavailability of a suitable symmetric form of the governing
   equations. In the present work, this issue is addressed by introducing
   the total energy of the water column to motivate a change of variables
   which symmetrizes the shallow-water conservation system. Then, the
   one-dimensional case is considered and a time-accurate,
   streamline-upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) scheme is developed based on
   the proposed symmetric form. Numerical results illustrate the method and
   permit comparison with other schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified stochastic infiltration model is presented, aimed at
   representing the rainfall-runoff transformation in the presence of
   heterogeneity in the soil and with precipitation as a random variable
   with complex temporal evolution. Such a model is based on a simple water
   mass balance of a surface soil layer, considered as a non-linear
   reservoir. The explicit inclusion of spatial heterogeneity allows the
   model to be used in sub-grid parametrizations at a variety of scales,
   from the distributed modelling of the hydrological response of small
   watersheds to the representation of surface mass fluxes in General
   Circulation Models. An approximate solution procedure is developed,
   which allows the estimation of statistical moments of the soil effective
   saturation and runoff inside discrete time steps where the hydraulic
   saturated conductivity and the rainfall intensity are taken as random
   variables with known probability density functions. As a first test of
   the proposed model, two different simulations, relative to two soils
   with different hydraulic conductivity distributions, are presented and
   discussed. A year long record of hourly averaged rainfall intensities,
   as measured by a tipping bucket gauge in Central Italy, is taken as the
   main input. The main finding is that the non-linear nature of the soil
   filter is such that, for random precipitation intensity, the coefficient
   of variation of the runoff is always higher than that of precipitation.
   Such a non-linear variability enhancement, due mainly to the threshold
   character of the soil mass balance equation, tends to be slightly
   dampened by the variability of the hydraulic saturated conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical and semi-analytical solutions of four steady-state flow and
   transport problems, pertinent to migration of single-component volatile
   liquids in homogeneous unsaturated subsurface media, are derived.
   Attention is concentrated mainly on the interaction of the liquid's flow
   and organic vapor transport processes in the upper part of a dry soil.
   Applications of the solutions to several examples, associated with soil
   contamination by benzene, illustrate the impact of volatility on the
   downward penetration of the liquid into the soil, its areal spread and
   capillary-rise above an impermeable layer. Results of this study
   indicate that the interaction between infiltration of the volatile
   liquid and transport of its vapors may be significant for relatively low
   fluxes only (< 10(-4)-10(-2) m day(-1)). Volatility bf the liquid
   significantly reduces its areal spread above the impermeable horizontal
   lower boundary located relatively close to the open ground surface (<
   1-10 m). It may also lead to a reduction in the capillary rise of the
   liquid residing in the soil, especially in coarse-textured soils.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, non-intrusive fluorescence imaging technique has been used to
   quantitatively measure the pore geometry, fluid velocity, and solute
   concentration within a saturated, three-dimensional porous medium.
   Discrete numerical averages of these quantities have been made over a
   representative volume of the medium and used to estimate macroscopic
   quantities that appear in conventional continuum models of flow and
   transport. The approach is meant to illustrate how microscopic
   information can be measured, averaged, and used to characterize
   medium-scale processes that are typically approximated constitutively.
   The experimental system consisted of a clear, cylindrical column packed
   with clear spherical beads and a refractive index-matched fluid seeded
   with fluorescent tracer particles and solute dye. By illuminating the
   fluid within the column with a scanning planar laser beam, details of
   flow and concentration within the pore spaces can be quantitatively
   observed, allowing for three-dimensional, time dependent information to
   be obtained at good resolution. In the current experiment,
   volumetrically averaged velocities and void-to-volume ratios are first
   compared with bulk measurements of fluid flux and medium porosity.
   Microscopic measurements of concentration are then used to construct
   cross-sectionally averaged profiles, mean breakthrough curves, and
   direct measurements of the dispersive flux, velocity variance, and
   concentration variance. In turn, the dispersive flux measurements are
   compared with mean concentration gradients to provide a basis for
   confirming the Fickian dispersion model and estimating dispersion
   coefficients for the medium. Coefficients determined in this manner are
   compared with others based upon traditional length-scale arguments, mean
   breakthrough analyses, and curve fits with numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Variable spatial and temporal weighting of the advective contaminant
   mole fraction term is explored as a means of reducing numerical
   dispersion of contaminant plumes in a multi-phase compositional
   simulator. The spatial schemes considered are upstream, central and a
   non-linear flux limiter, while fully-implicit and Crank-Nicolson time
   weighting are examined. The performance of each weighting scheme, in
   terms of stability of the Newton iteration and computational cost, is
   assessed for simplified problems designed to be representative of
   various aspects of more complex subsurface remediation problems. Results
   indicate that for problems with an homogeneous permeability field, the
   non-linear flux limiter along with fully-implicit weighting gives
   superior performance to any other combination of spatial and temporal
   weighting schemes. For heterogeneous permeability fields, the
   macrodispersion imparted by heterogeneity dominates numerical dispersion
   so that smearing of contaminant mole fraction fronts does not appear to
   be a serious problem.}},

   Theoretical development of region-averaged equations for slightly

Year = {{1996}},

Abstract = {{Transport processes in heterogeneous porous media are often treated in
   terms of one-equation models. Such a treatment assumes that the
   velocity, pressure, temperature, and concentration can be represented in
   terms of a single large-scale averaged quantity in regions having
   significantly different mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties. In
   this paper we explore the process of single-phase flow in a two-region
   model of heterogeneous porous media. The region-averaged equations are
   developed for the case of a slightly compressible flow which is an
   accurate representation for a certain class of liquid-phase flows. The
   analysis leads to a pair of transport equations for the region averaged
   pressures that are coupled through a classic exchange term, in addition
   to being coupled by a diffusive cross effect. The domain of validity of
   the theory has been identifed in terms of a series of length and
   timescale constraints.
   In Part II the theory is tested, in the absence of adjustable
   parameters, by comparison with numerical experiments for transient.
   slightly compressible flow in both stratified and nodular models of
   heterogeneous porous media. Good agreement between theory and experiment
   is obtained for nodular and stratified systems, and effective transport
   coefficients for a wide range of conditions are presented on the basis
   of solutions of the three closure problems that appear in the theory.
   Part III of this paper deals with the principle of large-scale
   mechanical equilibrium and the region-averaged form of Darcy's law. This
   form is necessary for the development and solution of the
   region-averaged solute transport equations that are presented in Part
   IV. Finally, in Part V we present results for the dispersion tensors and
   the exchange coefficient associated with the two-region model of solute
   transport with adsorption.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{63-73}},
Abstract = {{Steady seepage through a hillslope aquifer results in the formation of a
   water table. In this paper, the boundary conditions governing the steady
   water table location are analysed, and an analytical series method
   applied to the problem, using eigenfunction expansions. Eigenfunction
   expansions, modified for nonorthogonal basis functions, provide a
   conceptually simple, efficient estimation process, that reduces the
   steady water table problem to a sequence of curve fitting exercises. A
   rigorous examination of the hodograph relationships reveals the
   possibility of more than one water table location, for given recharge
   rate. An elementary analysis reveals that one of these possibilities can
   always be eliminated. Also, the boundary conditions governing the steady
   water table are determined at a non-vertical upstream boundary.
   Hillslopes subjected to low recharge rates can be very difficult to
   analyse, and appropriate techniques for this case are detailed. In a
   companion paper (Adv. Water Resour., 19(2) (1996) 75-81), the techniques
   described in this paper are put to the test, and the upstream boundary
   conditions are investigated, using the series methods.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater flow in a 3-D domain with fracture planes is numerically
   investigated using the finite element method. A flexible mesh generation
   method for discretization is proposed in this paper. The method, based
   on Delaunay triangulation, divides the whole domain into subdomains
   separated by fracture planes. It then triangulates each subdomain
   independently into tetrahedra which are further subdivided into
   hexahedra. By putting together all of the meshes of the subdomain, a
   finite element mesh of the whole domain is obtained. The appropriateness
   of the mesh generation method is topologically proved. Several
   applications of the proposed method are given, and the numerical
   solutions are in good agreement with those obtained with a structured
   grid. It is concluded that the proposed mesh generation method can

Abstract = {{The effect of random vs deterministic boundary conditions on the direct
   solution of one- and two-dimensional flow systems was examined. The
   one-dimensional case allows exact analytical solutions for the hydraulic
   gradient for various boundary conditions. The results demonstrate how a
   simple modeling choice (i.e. random vs deterministic boundary
   conditions) can make a significant difference in the mean and variance
   of the hydraulic gradient. The two-dimensional system models the
   location of constant head boundaries and no-flow boundaries as random.
   In the case of steady-state flow in a rectangular domain, a relatively
   constant increase in head variance was found throughout the domain.
   Finally, we show that no-flow boundaries whose positions are
   deterministically known, lower the head variance at points near the
   boundaries more than at the boundaries themselves.}},

Pages = {{1-8}},
Abstract = {{Most applications of stochastic ground water modeling rely on a
   perturbation assumption; the magnitude of the randomly distributed
   parameters in the governing equation should be small to obtain a valid
   solution.  A Gaussian method was developed to solve the ground water
   flow equation with random hydraulic conductivity distribution.  In the
   Gaussian method, the moment generating function for multivariate
   normally distributed random variables was used to express joint high
   order moments of hydraulic head and conductivity in terms of low order
   moments.  A set of coupled partial differential equations for the
   moments of the hydraulic head were formulated.  The number of unknowns
   in the Gaussian method was the same as in the perturbation method,
   however the `closure problem' was solved without the truncation of high
   order terms.  Comparison with an exact analytical solution suggested
   that the Gaussian method can be more appropriate in the case of short
   correlation length.  The Gaussian and the perturbations methods can be
   equivalent for the case of steady-state flow.  For transient ground
   water flow, the two methods are different.  The Gaussian method
   preserves the known lognormal spatial frequency distribution of the
   conductivity in the field.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{9-24}},
Abstract = {{A semianalytic approach for modeling tracer motion in heterogeneous
   permeable media is presented.  The method is analytic along streamlines;
   the streamlines are derived from an underlying velocity field which is
   obtained numerically from a conventional fluid flow simulator.  This
   generalizes the approach to any arbitrary configuration of wells and
   also to areally heterogeneous permeability fields.  The semianalytic
   scheme is based on the observation that in a velocity field derived by
   finite difference, streamlines can be approximated by piecewise
   hyperbolic intervals.  Along each of these intervals the evolution
   equation can be solved exactly.  Thus, the approach is free from
   numerical time truncation error.  Once tracer transit times to a
   producing well have been determined, the tracer response curve and the
   area swept by the tracer can be obtained from simple integral
   expressions.  The transit time formalism allows for easy extension of
   the semianalytic approach to multiphase flow problems and the results
   are shown to be in excellent agreement with high resolution
   finite-difference simulations, but obtained at a fraction of the
   computation time.  We have illustrated the semianalytic approach through
   application to tracer migration in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous
   quarter five spot patterns.}},

   temperature and humidity; precipitation and temperature; precipitation
   alone.  The outputs from the models are monthly river flow and other
   water balance components.  The models are examined on 91 small and
   medium sized basins, of which 85 are situated in Belgium and 6 in
   southern China, and they are capable of reproducing both the magnitude
   and timing of monthly and seasonal runoff, as well as changes in soil
   moisture conditions.  Results are satisfactory and there are barely any
   differences between the model types, although the amount of information
   used is very different.  Calibration is by automatic optimization
   without any subjective element.  Application in forecasting and Monte
   Carlo simulation are exemplified.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal perennial groundwater yield pumping strategies were computed for
   a complex multilayer aquifer with:  (i) confined and unconfined flow,
   and (ii) many flows typically described by piecewise-linear (nonsmooth)
   equations.  The latter flows account for over 50\% of the aquifer
   discharge from the test area, the eastern shore of the Great Salt Lake
   in Utah.  Normally utilized response matrix (RM) and embedding (EM)
   simulation/optimization modelling procedures did not converge to optimal
   solutions for this area; they diverged or oscillated.  However, the
   newly presented linear RM and EM approaches satisfactorily addressed the
   nonlinearities posed by over 2 000 piecewise-linear constraints for
   evapotranspiration, discharge from flowing wells, drain discharge, and
   vertical interlayer flow reduction due to desaturation of a confined
   aquifer.  Both presented modelling approaches converged to the same
   optimal solution.  Superposition was applied to the nonlinear problem
   by:  making a cycle within the RM analogous to an iteration in a
   simulation model (such as MODFLOW); and using a modified MODFLOW to
   develop influence coefficients.  The EM model contained about 40 000
   nonzero elements and 12 000 single equations and variables,

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{67-75}},
Abstract = {{A simulation/optimization (s/o) model is presented to address the
   increasingly common conflicts between water quantity and quality
   objectives. The model can assist water resources analysts in selecting
   compromise strategies for stream/aquifer systems in which the stream
   gains water from the aquifer. The water quantity objective is to
   maximize steady conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water
   resources. The water quality objective is to maximize waste loading from
   a sewage treatment plant (STP) to the stream without violating
   downstream water quality beyond acceptable limits. The STP discharge is
   proportional to human population.
   The two objectives conflict because an increase in groundwater
   extraction reduces dilution of the stream water contaminants. The result
   is a decrease in the STP waste loading to the stream and the
   waste-producing human population that can be supported. The trade-off
   between objectives is illustrated graphically via sets of noninferior
   solutions. The sets of noninferior solutions are prepared using the
   E-constraint method and assuming different upstream flow rates.
   The s/o model includes superposition expressions describing head and
   flow responses to decision variables (pumping, diversion, and loadings)
   and regression expressions describing contaminant concentration
   responses to these decision variables. Modeled contaminants include:
   5-day biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen (organic,
   ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate), organic and dissolved phosphorus, total

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Operator-splitting technique (OST) is a common mathematical approach
   used in the solution of the advection-dispersion-reaction equation
   (ADRE), especially in the presence of biological decay, where the scales
   of transport and biological decay are far apart. The OST introduces a
   time-lag between the advection-dispersion and reaction stages by
   splitting the ADRE causing a breakdown of the physics of the problem,
   thus limiting its applicability. In this work, the applicability of the
   operator splitting technique is studied in parts. This first manuscript
   addresses the critical limitations of the operator-splitting technique
   as related to first-order decay, and the second manuscript extends the
   work to include coupled transport between hydrocarbon and oxygen with
   Monod kinetics describing biological decay. The critical assessment is
   performed to address the errors associated with the time-lag due to
   splitting. The assessment is based on mass balance errors, deviations of
   concentration prediction and sensitivities of concentration deviations.
   The results show that the splitting introduces an inherent error
   independent of the discretization errors. This inherent error increases
   with reaction rate and time-lag, and the overall errors can be reduced
   by using the alternate operator-splitting technique suggested by
   previous researchers.}},

   discussion also considers the two-species coupled transport problem. The
   results of the analysis show that the behavior of the time-lag error
   causing a mass balance error is rather similar to those observed with
   first-order kinetics. The time-lag error directly depends on the
   reaction rate, and hence, affects the oxygen equation due to the high
   rate of oxygen consumption. Also, the alternate operator-splitting
   scheme shows a greater accuracy compared to the normal
   operator-splitting technique. Upon observing such similarities, a
   concept of equivalent first-order reaction rate is derived. The
   equivalent reaction rate has been found to be extremely useful for
   predicting the time-lag error of the single- and two-species mass
   transport with Monod kinetics using the result of the first-order
   reaction problems obtained in the first manuscript.}},

Pages = {{125-146}},
Abstract = {{In the analysis of aquifer behavior, it is common to distinguish between
   steady-state and dynamic or unsteady behavior. A special case of the
   latter is periodic behavior, in which an aquifer responds to forcing
   that varies sinusoidally in time. This paper presents an efficient
   method for obtaining analytical solutions far periodic aquifer bow,
   based on the use of complex algebra. It also provides a number of
   solutions which are simpler in form than those that are currently
   available. The solutions provide valuable insights into the spatial
   variations of amplitudes of head fluctuations and of the phase lags
   between periodic forcing and aquifer response. The classical problem of
   the response of a one-dimensional aquifer to tidally fluctuating
   boundary levels is re-examined. A solution is presented for the response
   of a one-dimensional aquifer to seasonal or diurnal variations in net
   recharge; interesting results include the amplification of head
   fluctuations beyond the expected maximum, and an explanation for the
   3-month and 6-h lags observed in annual and daily time series,
   respectively. Other examples include the effects of mixed boundary
   conditions, and the behavior of radially symmetric flow systems, either
   with flow inwards towards a pumping well, or flow outwards, as on a
   circular island. The amplitude and phase of fluxes through boundaries
   are also examined.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{18}},

Pages = {{159-170}},
Abstract = {{Difficulties in the numerical solution of the partial differential
   equations governing seawater intrusion in aquifers arise from the
   coupling between the flow and transport equations and from the nonlinear
   aspects of this coupling. Several linearization approaches are discussed
   for the solution of the nonlinear system which results from a finite
   element discretization of the coupled equations. It is first shown that
   the most commonly used solution method can be viewed as a Picard
   linearization applied to the transport equation, with the coupling
   resolved by iteration over the two governing equations. The full Newton
   scheme for solving the coupled problem produces a Jacobian of size 2N x
   2N, where N is the number of nodes in the discretization of both the
   flow and transport equations. To reduce the size and complexity of the
   full Newton scheme, a partial Newton method is proposed, which, like the
   Picard approach, produces matrix systems of size N x N. This scheme
   applies Newton linearization to the transport equation, and conventional
   iteration to resolve the coupling. Results from two- and
   three-dimensional test simulations show that the partial Newton scheme
   gives improved convergence and robustness compared to Picard
   linearization, especially for highly advective problems or large density
   ratios. Both approaches involve the solution of a symmetric (flow) and a
   nonsymmetric (transport) system of equations, and it is shown that the
   per iteration CPU cost for the partial Newton method is not
   significantly greater than that of the Picard scheme.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{203-215}},
Abstract = {{The application of Fick's law to describe hydrodynamic dispersion in
   porous media is based on the assumption of a linear dependance of a
   solute dispersive mass flux on its concentration gradient. Both
   theoretical and experimental studies have shown that the Fickian
   description of dispersion is not valid when large concentration
   variations in the porous medium are encountered. However, an appropriate
   alternative is still lacking. In this work, based on a theoretical
   derivation of the Fickian dispersion equation, a non-linear theory of
   dispersion is suggested. In the non-linear theory, in addition to the
   longitudinal and transversal dispersivities, a new parameter is
   introduced. Miscible displacement experiments are carried out in order
   to investigate the effects of large variations in salt mass fraction and
   to assess the validity of the new theory. Low-concentration liquid is
   displaced upwards in a vertical column by a high-concentration liquid.
   Thus, only hydrodynamically stable flow regimes are considered.
   The experiments are simulated by means of both classical Fick's law and
   the new non-linear theory. It is found that low-concentration-gradient
   experiments can be simulated satisfactorily using the Fickian-type
   dispersion equation. However, calculated breakthrough curves for
   high-concentration-gradient experiments deviate substantially from the
   measured curves. It appears that a satisfactory fit to
   high-concentration-gradient data can be obtained only if the value of
   longitudinal dispersivity is reduced by a factor of three. Using the
   nonlinear theory, however, it is possible to simulate both low- and
   high-concentration-gradient experiments with a unique set of parameter
   values.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling water movement in the unsaturated soil matrix is usually based

   based on a transformation of the unsaturated Darcy law to a fuzzy rule
   system. The rule system is combined with the continuity equation
   yielding a fuzzy rule-based model for simulating the unsaturated flow.
   Basic definitions of fuzzy logic are given and the concept of the
   unsaturated how model is outlined. The presented model performs well
   compared with a semi-analytical model and a 2-dimensional, numerical
   model. Furthermore the model has been incorporated into a

Abstract = {{In the southern part of Germany, shallow and mostly unconfined valley
   aquifers are widespread. The differential equation describing
   groundwater flow and its boundary conditions varies for different flow
   situations due to the transient nature of the groundwater table. The
   authors present a continuous physical-mathematical formulation of
   two-dimensional horizontal groundwater flow, which allows for a
   simultaneous computation of saturated unconfined, partially unsaturated,
   or confined aquifers. This requires a physically sensible functional
   relationship between the transmissivity and the piezometric head. To

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{345-352}},
Abstract = {{In developing finite element equations for steady state and transient
   diffusion-type processes, weighted volume integration is generally
   assumed to be an intrinsic requirement. It is shown that such finite
   element equations can be developed directly and with ease on the basis
   of the elementary notion of a surface integral. Although weighted volume
   integration is mathematically correct, the algebraic equations stemming
   from it are no more informative than those derived directly on the basis
   of a surface integral. An interesting upshot is that the derivation
   based on surface integration does not require knowledge of a partial
   differential equation but yet is logically rigorous. It is commonly
   stated that weighted volume integration of the differential equation
   helps one carry out analyses of errors, convergence and existence, and
   therefore, weighted volume integration is preferable. It is suggested
   that because the direct derivation is logically consistent, numerical
   solutions emanating from it must be testable for accuracy and internal
   consistency in ways that the style of which may differ from the
   classical procedures of error- and convergence-analysis. In addition to
   simplifying the teaching of the finite element method, the thoughts
   presented in this paper may lead to establishing the finite element
   method independently in its own right, rather than it being a surrogate
   of the differential equation. The purpose of this paper is not to
   espouse any one particular way of formulating the finite element
   equations. Rather, it is one of introspection. The desire is to
   critically examine our traditional way of doing things and inquire
   whether alternate approaches may reveal to us new and interesting
   insights.}},

Abstract = {{STOMP is a multipurpose engineering simulator for investigating
   remediation technologies for the cleanup of organic compounds and
   associated radionuclides within the soil and groundwater in the arid and

   solves flow and transport through variably saturated geologic media

   governing conservation equations. Modeling capabilities include those
   for multiple phases, compositional NAPL, and nonisothermal conditions
   using a variable configuration source code to apportion execution speed
   and memory requirements to the problem specifics. This paper presents a
   brief overview of the entire simulator and then focuses on solution
   techniques for solving problems involving nonvolatile three-phase
   systems with hysteretic, fluid entrapment, and nonhysteretic forms of
   the saturation-relative permeability-capillary pressure relations. The
   solution techniques concentrate on developed algorithms for
   phase-transitions, which are demonstrated for a hypothetical problem
   involving NAPL appearances and disappearances. Mass-balance errors for
   these simulations were less than 0.06\%. In a companion paper,
   saturations computed from simulations using STOMP are compared against

Abstract = {{STOMP, a subsurface flow and transport simulator for investigating
   remediation technologies, described in the preceding paper, is tested
   against simulation results from a published numerical code, MOFAT-2D,

   experiments. There is good agreement between the STOMP and MOFAT-2D
   simulations and between measured data and numerical results when STOMP
   is used to simulate the experiments. However, there are some
   discrepancies between measured and predicted fliud contents.
   Discrepancies at low fluid contents are assumed to be a function of
   relative permeability-saturation relations, and discrepancies near
   complete wetting-fluid saturation are assumed to be caused by failing to
   account for a nonwetting-fluid entry pressure in the fluid
   saturation-pressure relations. Despite the discrepancies, overall
   predictions of subsurface fluid behavior are good. These results suggest

Abstract = {{The effects of annual totals and seasonal variations of precipitation
   and potential evaporation on the annual water balance are explored.  It
   is assumed that the only other factor of significance to annual water
   balance is a simple process of water storage, and that the relevant
   storage capacity is the plant-available water-holding capacity of the
   soil.  Under the assumption that precipitation and potential evaporation
   vary sinusoidally through the year, it is possible to derive an analytic
   solution of the storage problem, and this yields an expression for the
   fraction of precipitation that evaporates (and the fraction that runs
   off) as a function of three dimensionless numbers:  the ratio of annual
   potential evaporation to annual precipitation (index of dryness); an
   index of the seasonality of the difference between precipitation and
   potential evaporation; and the ratio of plant-available water-holding
   capacity to annual precipitation.  The solution is applied to the area
   of the United States east of 105-degrees-W, using published information
   on precipitation, potential evaporation, and plant-available
   water-holding capacity as inputs, and using an independent analysis of
   observed river runoff for model evaluation.  The model generates an
   areal mean annual runoff of only 187 mm, which is about 30\% less than
   the observed runoff (263 mm).  The discrepancy is suggestive of the
   importance of runoff-generating mechanisms neglected in the model. 
   These include intraseasonal variability (storminess) of precipitation,
   spatial variability of storage capacity, and finite infiltration
   capacity of land.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of small-scale heterogeneity in land surface characteristics
   on the large-scale fluxes of water and energy in the land-atmosphere
   system has become a central focus of many of the climatology research
   experiments.  The acquisition of high resolution land surface data
   through remote sensing and intensive land-climatology field experiments
   (like HAPEX and FIFE) has provided data to investigate the interactions
   between microscale land-atmosphere interactions and macroscale models. 
   One essential research question is how to account for the small scale
   heterogeneities and whether `effective' parameters can be used in the
   macroscale models.  To address this question of scaling the probability
   distribution for evaporation is derived which illustrates the conditions
   for which scaling should work.  A correction algorithm that may be
   appropriate for the land parametrization of a GCM is derived using a
   second order linearization scheme.  The performance of the algorithm is
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic processes that are components of regional water balance occur
   on scales considerably smaller than the region itself.
   Evapotranspiration and percolation during interstorm periods are
   hydrologic processes whose rates depend on conditions that vary
   significantly in space due to soil and vegetation heterogeneity as well
   as moisture redistribution under topography. Infiltration and runoff
   during storm periods also vary significantly in space due to the spatial
   variability in surface moisture conditions. In time, these hydrologic
   processes are switching between climate-limited and soil-controlled
   regimes during both storm and interstorm periods. The space and time
   dependence inherent in these components of water balance limit the
   applicability of lumped or averaged models. These simplified models
   appear in hydrologic applications whose objectives are to estimate
   regional water balance. They are also present in the hydrologic
   parametrization of atmospheric models.
   In this paper an analytical model of soil-water balance that is
   distributed in space and time is developed. In order to retain
   analytical tractability, it is assumed that the space-time variability
   is statistically homogeneous and isotropic. The surface hydrology is
   forced with a stochastic model of rainfall that phenomenologically
   captures the arrival of intense precipitating cells within clusters that
   are imbedded in squall lines and rainbands. An analysis of the spatial
   and temporal fluctuations in both the rainfields and soil moisture
   fields are made in frequency-domain. The effects of averaging operations
   on these fields are delineated and the consequences for hydrologic and
   atmospheric models that use lumped water balance expressions are
   quantified.}},

Abstract = {{`Bucket'-type land surface models are being replaced in some general
   circulation model (GCM) climate studies by `SVAT' (Surface
   Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer) models, which feature an explicit
   treatment of vegetation control over the surface energy balance.  The
   evaporation calculations of a typical SVAT model differ from those of a
   bucket model in at least four fundamental ways:  (a) the SVAT model
   typically allows a greater variety of environmental stresses to limit
   evapotranspiration; (b) it generally includes a canopy interception
   reservoir; (c) the control of the land surface over evaporation in a
   SVAT model is influenced by the atmosphere; and (d) the land surface
   control in a SVAT model varies on short time scales.
   Global fields and grid square diurnal cycles illustrate the hydrological
   cycle produced in a 20-year simulation with an atmospheric GCM coupled
   to a SVAT model.  A sensitivity analysis then examines the relative
   importance of the SVAT/bucket differences in terms of their effects on
   the simulated hydrological cycle.  The interception reservoir exerts
   more control over global evaporation than does either the vapor pressure
   deficit stress or the temperature stress.  The effect of the temperature
   stress is, in fact, insignificant.  The time variability of land surface
   control over the surface energy balance in a SVAT model significantly
   increases moisture convergence over land.}},

Abstract = {{In current General Circulation models (GCMs) and their proposed
   improvements, the fluxes of heat and moisture from soil storage and
   plant canopies are represented by a large number of parameters. 
   Sensitivity testing of the candidate parametrizations is thus an
   important step in model development.  Repeated simulations with the full
   GCM is burdened by both cost and the burial of sensitivity information
   in large volumes of generated data.  Here we propose the use of a simple
   climate model with a full hydrologic cycle to perform some of the basic
   sensitivity experiments and thereby reduce the number of experiments for
   the three-dimensional GCM.  The simple climate model is thus used to
   screen the multitude of possible parameter-sensitivity experiments. 
   This model is derived from the column model of Koster and Eagleson (J.
   Climate, 3(6) (1990) 593-606) and it contains the important
   one-dimensional physical processes of GCMs.  The large-scale convergence
   of heat and moisture for the atmosphere is parametrized; atmospheric
   dynamics are therefore neglected in that momentum equations are not
   solved in this simple climate model.
   In a series of sensitivity experiments, the influence of some land
   boundary parameters on the partitioning of the atmospheric precipitation
   and radiative forcing at the land surface are determined.  The role of
   soil texture, soil column discretization and percolation boundary
   condition at the bottom of the soil column on surface water and energy
   balance components are investigated using the simple climate model.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation results in several adverse effects on the natural
   environment.  The focus of this paper is on the effects of deforestation
   on land-surface processes and regional climate of the Amazon basin.  In
   general, the effects of deforestation on climate are likely to depend on
   the scale of the deforested area.  In this study, we are interested in
   the effects due to deforestation of areas with a scale of about 250 km. 
   Hence, a meso-scale climate model is used in performing numerical
   experiments on the sensitivity of regional climate to deforestation of
   areas with that size.  It is found that deforestation results in less
   net surface radiation, less evaporation, less rainfall, and warmer
   surface temperature.  The magnitude of the change in temperature is of
   the order of 0.5-degrees-C, the magnitudes of the changes in the other
   variables are of the order of 10\%.
   In order to verify some of the results of the numerical experiments, the
   model simulations of net surface radiation are compared to recent
   observations of net radiation over cleared and undisturbed forest in the
   Amazon.  The results of the model and the observations agree in the
   following conclusion:  the difference in net surface radiation between
   cleared and undisturbed forest is, almost, equally partitioned between
   net solar radiation and net long-wave radiation.  This finding
   contributes to our understanding of the basic physics in the
   deforestation problem.}},

Abstract = {{Two main issues associated with the application of the stochastic
   continuum approach to numerical modeling of regional groundwater flow
   and mass transport through crystalline rocks is addressed.  First, the
   problem of conductivity upscaling from a highly heterogeneous subgrid
   (measurement) conductivity field to a less heterogeneous supragrid
   (model) one is studied.  Secondly, the question of whether the
   intervening rock masses between major fracture zones can allow for a
   sufficient spatial homogenization of a dispersion phenomenon as required
   by invoking the ergodic hypothesis is studied.  For the sake of this
   paper, it is assumed that the observed spatial variability of apparent
   conductivity data, determined by 3 m double-packer tests, obeys a
   statistically isotropic and stationary lognormal random function in two
   dimensions with a logconductivity variance sigma(lnK)2 of 16.  The
   result of the numerical simulations undertaken suggests that the
   upscaling of a highly heterogeneous subgrid conductivity field may
   benefit from considering the anisotropy characteristics caused by an
   insufficient homogenization of the subgrid heterogeneity on the scale of
   a supragrid model block.  Concerning the spreading of a conservative
   solute the of a supragrid model block.  Concerning the spreading of a
   conservative solute the treatment was restricted to a single realization
   with a characteristic field dimension of 32lambda(ln K), where lambda(ln
   K) is the logconductivity integral scale.  The solute dispersion was
   studied in two orthogonal directions by particle tracking.  Despite an
   isotropic logconductivity field, the particle tracking produces
   different dispersivities, which demonstrates that the particular
   realization studied was not large enough to provide ergodicity.}},

   It is shown that the QUICK scheme is generally second-order accurate in
   space and that a general explicit finite difference representation of
   various upwind difference schemes is numerically unstable for the
   severest transport case.  Various modified forms of the implicit TCSD
   scheme are presented with their numerical stability properties being
   studied and analysed.  These modified schemes have been applied to an
   idealised one-dimensional test basin for the cases of pure advection and
   of advection and diffusion using three different initial-boundary
   conditions, including:  (a) a sharp front concentration gradient; (b) a
   Gaussian concentration distribution; and (c) a plug source.  A
   two-dimensional version of the modified TCSD scheme has also been
   formulated based upon the standard ADI technique and has been applied to
   three two-dimensional test cases, including pure diffusion for a
   Gaussian distribution.  Both uniform and rotational flow fields were

Abstract = {{A perturbation model of water movement in heterogeneous soils is
   presented, emphasizing its theoretical features.  It is based on the
   fundamental physical concepts of continuity and Darcy's law which hold
   in saturated and in unsaturated zones.  Soil heterogeneity may be
   represented by an arbitrary number of spatially varying stochastic
   parameters.  The derivation of the model equations leads to a system of
   functional differential equations which describes the average behaviour
   of a flow process and predicts its stochastic variability.  This system
   will be reduced to the familiar Richards equation, if the soil
   parameters are assumed to be known deterministically.  For the general
   stochastic case it is shown how the deterministic concept of volume
   conservation is transferred to the conservation of the corresponding
   distribution moments.  Suitable initial and boundary conditions are
   formulated for means and covariances of hydraulic head and flux. 
   Finally, the range of applicability of the new flow model is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The Galerkin finite element method was applied to solve the equations
   governing the physical processes of snowmelting and infiltration of
   meltwater in a subfreezing snowpack. The numerical model formulation is

   elements accompanied by the corresponding 4-node quadrilateral elements
   along the melting surface within the same meshing system. Equations
   which govern the surface melting, the water flow, the local and the
   global heat conductions were coupled and solved within the same time
   step. The nodes on the moving snow surface were allowed to move to allow
   for the snowpack thinning during melting. The hydraulic and thermal
   properties of snow were updated based on the snow bulk density change
   due to meltwater refreezing. Various simulations were presented and
   compared for the purpose of identifying dominant effects of the physical
   system under complex snowmelting scenarios. The model is able to

Abstract = {{The assumption of local mass equilibrium for describing the transport of

   model is developed for homogeneous porous media using the method of
   local volume averaging. The resulting macroscopic equation involves a
   dispersion tenser that is influenced by the mass transfer process,
   additional convective transport terms, and a linear form for the
   interfacial mass flux. Two local closure problems are provided that
   allow one to compute the effective transport coefficients so that theory
   and experiment can be compared in the absence of adjustable parameters.
   Numerical methods are used to solve the two local closure problems, and

Abstract = {{A numerical model has been developed to simulate the biodegradation of
   trichloroethylene (TCE) by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b bacteria as
   observed in a saturated, open system sand-bed experiment. The sand pack
   was inoculated with bacteria in a resting state (without nutrients) to
   form a 10 cm thick attached filter along the direction of flow.
   Degradation occurs through cometabolism of TCE to Cl- and primarily
   HCO3- as the major overall carbon product. A steady, 1.5 cm/h saturated
   flow was established in the sand pack, and was later doped (upstream of
   the attached filter) with a 13-day, 4 ppm pulse of TCE. Concentrations
   of TCE were monitored immediately upstream and downstream of the
   attached bacterial filter. Accounting for travel time through the test
   bed, observed downstream concentrations indicated degradation in the
   filter was complete for 0.5 days, substantially complete for another 1.5
   days, and increasingly limited over the next 11 days, after which the
   outflow concentrations returned to zero, indicating the end of the
   pulse. Measurements of Cl- breakthrough were used to confirm TCE
   degradation quantitatively. The return of TCE in the downstream flow was
   anticipated from repetitive exposure, cyclic transfer experiments in
   sealed tubes which showed a limited capacity of the bacteria in the
   resting state to degrade TCE. Simulations based upon a
   previously-determine Michaelis-Menton relationship were used to
   successfully model the experimental results in the sand test-bed. Based
   upon the tube-transfer experiments, the rate law was adjusted to account
   for a fixed or limited capacity of the bacteria in the resting state to
   degrade TCE. The degradation capacity of sand-attached M. trichosporium
   OB3b has been estimated to be about 0.30 g TCE/g bacteria, and is not
   expected to be a leading limitation in implementing this approach for
   bioremediation in the held.}},

Abstract = {{Distributions of flow on the face of a well surrounded by a disturbed

   derived for the disturbed zone in two- and n-layered aquifers.  The
   example for a disturbed zone in the two-layered aquifer shows that when
   the disturbed zone is large and when pumping rate is a constant, the
   flow distribution tends to be uniform.  Using the derived equations for
   the flow distribution, we also give the relative error expression of the

   example shows that for a thick disturbed zone, the measured flow may
   contain a large error because of the crossflow between layers.  For a
   low-permeability layer, the disturbed zone results in an overestimation
   of hydraulic conductivity, and for a high-permeability layer, the
   disturbed zone results in an underestimation of conductivity because the

   fractures with and without colloid penetration into the rock matrix are

   parallel plates.  It is assumed that colloidal particles undergo
   irreversible deposition onto fracture surfaces and may penetrate into
   the rock matrix, and deposit irreversibly onto rock matrix solid
   surfaces.  The solutions are obtained by taking Laplace transforms to
   the governing transport equations and boundary conditions with respect
   to time and space.  For the case of no colloid penetration into the rock
   matrix, the solutions are expressed in terms of exponentials and
   complimentary error functions; whereas, for the case of colloid,
   penetration into the rock matrix, the solutions are expressed in terms
   of convolution integrals and modified Bessel functions.  The impact of
   the model parameters on colloid transport is examined.  The results from
   several simulations indicate that liquid-phase as well as deposited
   colloid concentrations in the fracture are sensitive to the fracture
   surface deposition coefficient, the fracture aperture, and the Brownian
   diffusion coefficient for colloidal particles penetrating the rock
   matrix.  Furthermore, it is shown that the differences between the two

   transport conditions.  The constant concentration condition
   overestimates liquid-phase colloid concentrations, whereas the constant

Abstract = {{The classical convection-dispersion equation (CDE) and the stochastical
   convection-dispersion equation (SCDE) were utilized to study solute
   transport in homogeneous and heterogeneous porous media.  Extensive
   experimental data collected in 1 250-cm soil columns were used for
   testing validity of the CDE and SCDE.  Analyses of the experimental data
   showed that the observed dispersion coefficient increased with the
   travel distance for both homogeneous and heterogeneous soils.  The range
   of the dispersion coefficients was from 0.05 to 20 cm2 min-1 for the
   homogeneous soil, and from 3 to 200 cm2 min-1 for the heterogeneous
   soil.  A linear relationship between the dispersion coefficient and
   travel distance, assumed in the SCDE, described the scale-dependent
   dispersion coefficient reasonably well.  Therefore, the SCDE predicted
   solute transport in the porous media more accurately than the CDE for
   these examples.  In addition, the SCDE provided more consistent
   estimation of breakthrough curves than the CDE, using information
   obtained at a location either close to or far from the predicting place.}},

Abstract = {{The local change of scale method couples the macroscopic permeability

   it is clear that the classical Representative Elementary Volume (REV) is
   too small and must be replaced by a larger `Darcy Representative
   Elementary Volume'. The validity of the implementation is demonstrated
   by producing the correct results on a simple periodic array where
   analytic solution exists. Maps of local pseudo-velocity and
   pseudo-pressure fields in analogues of diagenetically perturbed media
   are realistic. For several cases of diagenetically perturbed media, the
   EFV method is sufficient. This is important in that EFV method has a

Abstract = {{The position and rate of change of the advance front due to surface
   water spreading on a flat surface is computed using a two-step approach.
   The size of the spreading pool is first calculated using a volume

   approximated using potential theory. This is simplified by using
   distributed point sources to represent the source. A combination of both
   techniques allows isochrones of the advance front from any source to be
   predicted. Site specific advance front velocity values are calculated
   from the constructed isochrones. An equation is also presented for the
   general rate of change of the pool area. Isochrones families, for a
   number of different shaped sources, are presented as is a discussion on
   the construction of streamlines. The isochrones lines are also used to
   define lines of constant infiltration opportunity time and constant
   cumulative infiltration. The combined technique offers a foundation on

Abstract = {{The coupled ocean-atmosphere-land climate system is characterized by
   substantial amounts of variability on a wide range of spatial and
   temporal scales. This natural variability of climate increases the
   difficulty of detecting climate change attributable to increasing
   greenhouse gas concentrations. A key issue in climate research is
   obtaining a better description of this variability and the physical
   mechanisms responsible for it. One of the important physical processes
   contributing to this variability is the interaction between the land
   surface and the atmosphere. Through its effect on the surface energy
   flux components, the land surface can exert a pronounced effect on the
   variability of the atmosphere. The potential importance of such
   interactions for climate variability is examined through the use of
   numerical modeling studies. The physical mechanisms governing the time
   scales of soil moisture variability in the model are outlined, and
   observational evidence is presented supporting this analysis. In
   addition, it is shown that interactions between soil wetness and the
   atmosphere can both increase the total variability of the atmosphere and
   lengthen the time scales of near-surface atmospheric fluctuations.}},

Pages = {{21-39}},
Abstract = {{The rapidly developing practice of encapsulating knowledge in electronic
   media is shown to lead necessarily to the restructuring of the knowledge
   itself. The consequences of this for hydraulics, hydrology and more
   general water-resources management are investigated in particular
   relation to current process-simulation, real-time control and
   advice-serving systems. The generic properties of the electronic
   knowledge encapsulator are described, and attention is drawn to the
   manner in which knowledge `goes into hiding' through encapsulation. This
   property is traced in the simple situations of pure mathesis and in the
   more complex situations of taxinomia using one example each from
   hydraulics and hydrology. The consequences for systems architectures are
   explained, pointing to the need for multi-agent architectures for
   ecological modelling and for more general hydroinformatics systems also.
   The relevance of these developments is indicated by reference to ongoing
   projects in which they are currently being realised. In conclusion, some
   more general epistemological aspects are considered within the same
   context. As this contribution is so much concerned with the processes of
   signification and communication, it has been partly shaped by the theory
   of semiotics, as popularised by Eco (A Theory of Semiotics, Indiana

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-67}},
Abstract = {{The present work incorporates the effects of interface dynamics into the
   theoretical description of two-phase flow in a porous medium. This
   advance offers the potential for improved understanding and modeling of
   multiphase flow processes. To provide background for this work, the
   traditional approach to describing two-phase flow in porous media is
   reviewed. The universally employed empirical extension of Darcy's Law
   for single-phase flow to two-phase flow situations is rejected as
   arbitrary and subject to severe shortcomings. Burial of dynamic effects
   into relative permeability and capillary pressure hysteresis is shown to
   be an unsatisfactory theoretical construct for modeling the actual
   processes occurring in two-phase flow. Examination of the traditional
   theory at equilibrium shows that interfacial forces actually present in
   multiphase systems have been overlooked causing the theory to provide
   contradictory results. To overcome these problems, a general theory of
   two-phase flow is proposed that is based on the basic principles of
   mass, momentum, and energy conservation and the second law of
   thermodynamics. This theory accounts, in a systematic way, for
   interfacial forces that are known to have an important effect on the
   movement of fluid phases in a porous medium. A new equation of momentum
   balance accounting for the presence of interfaces and their energetics
   is developed. This equation reduces to Darcy's Law for the special case
   of single-phase flow. The extended theory has the potential to describe
   phenomena unaccounted for by the traditional theory and thus provides a
   basis for scientific understanding of the physics of two-phase flow.
   Application of the theory requires experimental study to ascertain the
   values and precise functional dependence of the constitutive

Abstract = {{Recently, it has been shown that in the case of nonlinear solute
   adsorption the displacement may be in the form of a travelling wave. In
   this paper, we investigate whether a travelling wave type of behaviour
   can be expected when two different types of sorption sites can be
   distinguished with different isotherms and kinetics. Illustrations are
   given for cases where the overall isotherm comprises two contributions
   that follow the Langmuir and the Freundlich equations, respectively.
   Boundary conditions are chosen that ensure a decrease in concentration
   in the direction of flow. Depending on the value of the Freundlich power
   (p) the travelling wave may exist. For p less-than-or-equal-to 1, the
   travelling wave always exists, whereas for 1 < p less-than-or-equal-to 2
   it depends on the values of the other adsorption parameters and whether
   a lower bound of the upstream concentration (at x = -infinity) is
   exceeded. For p greater-than-or-equal-to 2, the existence of the
   travelling wave requires that the upstream concentration does not exceed
   an (specified) upper bound. Besides illustrating some waves we show that
   two different rate functions that have the Freundlich isotherm as their
   limit for an infinite rate parameter result in qualitatively different
   travelling waves.}},

Abstract = {{A computational model was developed for simulating capillary

   utilizes percolation and network theories to describe fluid movement
   within the pore space. Percolation theory calls for a set of
   displacement rules to determine the movement of the fluids under
   capillary-driven transport. A comprehensive set of rules appropriate for
   either two-fluid or three-fluid systems is described. These rules
   account for a variety of processes affecting displacement, such as
   wetting films, hysteresis, trapping of fluids, and gravity. The model is
   shown to reproduce the basic characteristics of a two-fluid capillary
   pressure-saturation curve, and model predictions are shown to agree with

Abstract = {{Groundwater models contain parameters that characterize the hydraulic
   response of aquifer systems. Because the parameters are never known with
   certainty, they are normally adjusted in a calibration step to bring the
   computed values of the hydraulic head into agreement with the measured
   values. The calibration problem can be formulated as a minimization
   problem with a quadratic objective function and nonlinear constraints.
   The quadratic objective function is formed by adding the weighted sum of
   the squares of measurement residuals to the weighted sum of the squares
   of departures from prior parameter estimates. Weighting matrices are
   formed by taking the inverses of the estimated covariance matrices of
   the head measurements and original parameter estimates. The Galerkin
   finite element equations are considered nonlinear constraints which are
   enforced by the penalty method. The proposed procedure is unique because
   the Galerkin finite element equations are incorporated directly into the
   objective function and the objective function is minimized with respect
   to both the parameters and the nodal values of the hydraulic heads. The
   solution generates an updated parameter set and the solution to the

   produces the error of estimation of the heads and parameters. Results

Abstract = {{Natural or field soils are characterized, in general, by the existence
   of macropores. Two approaches to modeling flow in such soils can be
   identified in the literature. The first describes the flow in two
   distinct domains: one in the soil and another in macropores, with
   appropriate interaction between the two systems. The second treats the
   whole system as a continuum with properties that are averaged over a
   representative control volume. This study is aimed at assessing the
   success of both field- and laboratory-based soil-data in representing
   the behavior of field soils under drainage, within a Darcian, continuum
   framework. Based on available data, three approaches to defining the
   hydraulic properties are adopted. The first two models represent closely
   data from undisturbed core-samples that were obtained independently from
   drainage measurements. The third is an approximate data model with
   parameters that are determined from field-measured tensiometric data
   during drainage. For each data model, available data are used to their
   fullest extent without any adjustment. The approximate data model
   represents best the behavior of the field soil under drainage
   conditions. The laboratory-based hydraulic functions, although estimated
   from undisturbed samples, are less successful in representing the
   bebavior of such soils. When compared to elaborated sampling and
   laboratory analyses, estimating the hydraulic properties from in-situ
   measured tensiometric data is not only more convenient, but can also be
   more accurate. The study concludes that the equivalent porous-media
   approach is valid for modeling drainage in well-drained field soils.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1984 and 1987, Lake Toba, a large crater lake in northern
   Sumatra, suffered a severe and continuous decline in water level of
   about 2.5 m. The outflow from the lake was used to generate electrical
   power which provided the sole supply to an aluminium smelter. An
   investigation into the cause of the decline was carried out by means of
   a water balance model.
   Rainfall on the lake and the outflow were determined after an
   examination of the available data. The runoff from the lake catchment
   was estimated from a regional analysis of runoff in relation to
   catchment characteristics. Evaporation from the lake was estimated by
   the Penman method which was calibrated for local conditions by direct
   measurements using the eddy correlation technique.
   Water balance calculations showed that the decline in water levels was
   due to water for power generation being released from the lake at a
   greater rate than the net inflow. This occurred because net inflows had
   declined since the period before 1973 on which the design of the power
   plants was based and the operation of the plants had not been altered
   sufficiently to compensate for this decline.
   The decline in net inflows of about 18\% was probably caused by a small
   but sustained reduction in rainfall. The quality of rainfall data for
   the Lake Toba region itself was too poor to show whether or not there
   had been any significant change, but examination of long-term rainfall
   trends over a wider region indicated that a decline of the order of 10\%
   may well have occurred. This would be sufficient to account for the
   greater part of the decline in net inflows. Other factors, such as
   change in land use, may have contributed, but to a lesser degree.}},

Abstract = {{Mass balance accuracy of two-phase immiscible flow models used for
   contaminant hydrology applications is examined through comparisons of
   finite element and finite difference solutions of the pressure-based and
   pressure-saturation formulations. The influence of model formulation and
   initial conditions on mass balance performance is explored. Model
   simulations demonstrate that accurate solutions for multiphase flow
   problems can be obtained with either finite element or finite
   difference, pressure-based or pressure-saturation formulations, if
   coefficients and initial conditions are properly treated. In the
   pressure-based formulation, capacity coefficients arise from the
   expansion of the saturation variables in terms of capillary pressure.
   Mass balance accuracy depends upon the proper evaluation of the capacity
   coefficients when the capillary pressure-saturation relation is
   nonlinear. Capacity coefficient approximations for finite element
   pressure-based models are developed which preserve elemental expansion
   of the saturation derivative. These approximations are shown to produce
   good mass balance results and accurate solutions, in contrast with
   traditional finite element approaches. When the organic liquid is
   initially absent from a domain, simulations reveal that mass balance
   accuracy is obtained only when the initial pressure distribution is
   established from a zero capillary pressure condition. The influence of
   matrix mass lumping and the minimum value of the capacity coefficient on
   model performance is also investigated.}},

   coordinate systems, thus accounting for curved boundaries of a
   computational domain. For flux boundary conditions convenient formulae
   avoid the cumbersome use of imaginary points outside the computational
   domain without reducing the order of magnitude of the approximation
   error. A flexible iteration strategy caters, on the one hand, for
   accuracy and stability when simulating sharp wet fronts and, on the

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{259-275}},
Abstract = {{The advection-diffusion (AD) equation is widely used to represent flood
   wave propagation in waterways. Laplace transform methods are employed to
   obtain the exact solution of a nonhomogeneous AD equation with spatially
   varied initial condition and time dependent Dirichlet boundary
   conditions. Numerical inversion of the Laplace transform is employed to
   solve the AD equation with Neumann and Robin boundary conditions
   specified at the downstream end of a finite reach of channel. The
   Neumann boundary condition is specified by the assumption that water
   level remains constant at the downstream boundary, that is, by a mass
   conservation version. This is a special case of the general condition
   that is obtained by plugging a steady rating curve into the continuity
   equation. Backwater effects are assessed by analyzing response functions
   of flood wave movement in a semi-infinite channel and of a finite
   channel with the general condition prescribed as the downstream boundary
   condition. The Robin boundary condition, however, is derived on the
   basis of momentum conservation through the stage-discharge relationship.
   To investigate backwater effects a simple parameterized inflow
   hydrograph, based on Hermite polynomials, is introduced. The inflow
   flood hydrograph is completely determined, given three parameters: the
   time to peak t(p), the base time t(b), and the peak discharge Q(p).
   Comparisons between backwater effects associated with the Neumann and
   the Robin boundary conditions are made.}},

   the elemental matrices of the model to be expressed in a simple

Abstract = {{The application of an adaptive-grid method to a mathematical model for

   large gradients in space and in time. For this type of problem, an
   adaptive-grid method can be greatly beneficial. We consider a method
   based on local-uniform-grid refinement, where integration takes place on
   a series of nested, local-uniform finer and finer subgrids. These
   subgrids are created up to a level of refinement where sufficient
   spatial accuracy is reached, and their location and shape are adjusted
   after each time step. The space domain is considered to be a rectangle,
   and all grids in use are uniform and cartesian. The interfaces,
   demarking the inhomogeneities, are assumed to coincide with cell edges
   in the numerical approximation. Special conditions are applied here,
   connecting the solutions on both sides of the interface. These interface
   conditions involve continuity of fluxes across the interfaces. The

Abstract = {{Ahlfeld and Pinder recently proposed a method for reducing the enormous

   appropriately to maximize their utility and yield the fewest

   interpolation points should be based on the underlying probability
   distribution of the random variable(s). This is illustrated through an

Abstract = {{The accuracy of computer model calculations is usually examined via a
   validation study. The results of such studies are commonly presented by
   plotting model calculations and measured values on the same axes, and
   the match between them is usually evaluated by inspection. This is a
   subjective approach, which is not an appropriate basis for making
   regulatory decisions concerning public health and safety.
   It is suggested that linear regression analysis of calculated results
   and measured data can be used to evaluate the results of a validation in
   a more objective and quantitative manner. The coefficients of the
   resulting regression line are interpreted as an empirical indicator of
   model bias. The confidence interval based on the standard error of the
   regression is interpreted as a measure of the uncertainty in the model
   predictions.
   The merits and limitations of the proposed evaluation scheme are
   discussed from the point of view of having to assess the reliability of
   calculations performed by someone else. The simplicity of this approach
   is both its largest advantage and its greatest limitation. Linear
   regression of calculated and measured data provides no insights into the
   cause of model inaccuracies, but the ease and simplicity of obtaining an
   empirical, quantitative measure of the accuracy of model predictions
   compensates for the potential for misinterpretation of the results. The
   evaluation method is demonstrated by a validation of groundwater flow
   and contaminant transport calculations for a uranium tailings site.}},

Title = {{A STOCHASTIC APPROACH TO MODEL VALIDATION}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-32}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes a stochastic approach for assessing the validity of
   environmental models. In order to illustrate basic concepts we focus on
   the problem of modeling moisture movement through an unsaturated porous
   medium. We assume that the modeling objective is to predict the mean
   distribution of moisture content over time and space. The mean moisture
   content describes the large-scale flow behavior of most interest in many
   practical applications. The model validation process attempts to
   determine whether the model's predictions are acceptably close to the
   mean. This can be accomplished by comparing small-scale measurements of
   moisture content to the model's predictions. Differences between these
   two quantities can be attributed to three distinct `error sources': (1)
   measurement error, (2) spatial heterogeneity, and (3) model error. If we
   adopt appropriate stochastic descriptions for the first two sources of
   error we can view model validation as a hypothesis testing problem where
   the null hypothesis states that model error is negligible. We illustrate
   this concept by comparing the predictions of a simple two-dimensional
   deterministic model to measurements collected during a field experiment
   carried out near Las Cruces, New Mexico. Preliminary results from this
   field test indicate that a stochastic approach to validation can
   identify model deficiencies and provide objective standards for model
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{We present our views on validation. We consider that validation is
   slightly different for general models and specific models. For a general
   model validation consists of establishing the case for the model such
   that the model is widely accepted within the scientific community.
   However, for a specific model, which is unlikely to be reviewed by many
   people, validation consists of establishing a case such that one might
   reasonably expect that someone with relevant technical knowledge would
   consider that the model was acceptable. Thus we stress the importance of
   presenting for review the case for (or against) a model. We outline a
   formal framework for validation, which helps to ensure that all the
   issues are addressed. Our framework includes calibration, testing
   predictions, comparison with alternative models (which we consider
   particularly important), analysis of discrepancies, presentation,
   consideration of implications and suggesting improved experiments. We
   illustrate the approach by application to an INTRAVAL test case based on
   laboratory experiments. Three models were considered: a simple model
   that included the effects of advection, dispersion and equilibrium
   sorption, a model that also included the effects of rock-matrix
   diffusion, and a model with kinetic sorption. We show that the model
   with rock-matrix diffusion is the only one to provide a good description
   of the data. We stress the implications of extrapolating to larger
   length and time scales for repository performance assessments.}},

   the interpretation of tracer experiments in groundwater are reviewed and

   ambiguous, due to the interplay of parameters, and then a proper

   unique calibration is achieved, an ideal validation process is usually
   impossible or uneconomical to perform. Therefore, indirect validation
   methods must be used. A satisfactory agreement of the values of
   parameters obtained by calibration with those known from independent
   observations may be regarded as an indirect validation. Direct or
   indirect validation is often obtained only with respect to some
   parameters and in such cases it should be regarded as a partial

   flows in the fracture zone. Solute transport in the channel flows was
   simulated by a particle-tracking technique considering matrix diffusion.
   Calculated breakthrough curves and pressures were compared with

   well, but some important assumptions are necessary for calibration of
   the breakthrough curves. Further experimental data related to the

Abstract = {{Ground-water models are embodiments of scientific hypotheses. As such,
   the models cannot be proven or validated, but only tested and

   from conceptual deficiencies, numerical errors, and inadequate parameter
   estimation. Case histories of model applications to the Dakota Aquifer,
   South Dakota, to bedded salts in New Mexico, and to the upper Coachella
   Valley, California, illustrate that calibration produces a nonunique
   solution and that validation, per se, is a futile objective. Although
   models are definitely valuable tools for analyzing ground-water systems,

Abstract = {{The problem of the placement of pumps and the selection of pumping rates
   are the most important issues in designing contaminated groundwater
   remediation systems using a pump-and-treat strategy. Three nonlinear

   first problem formulation considers hydraulic constraints and reduces
   the plume concentration to a specified regulation standard value within
   a given planning time while minimizing capital cost. The second
   formulation minimizes residual contaminant in a fixed period under
   hydraulic constraints only. The third formulation is similar to the
   second formulation; however, in this formulation the number of pumps is
   prespecified by using the results from the first formulation. The
   inclusion of well installation costs in the first problem formulation
   results in a nonsmooth objective function. For such problems, only local
   optimum solutions can be expected by the use of conventional nonlinear
   optimization techniques. In the present paper, the simulated annealing

Abstract = {{To adequately evaluate the environmental impact of siting nuclear waste
   repositories in basalt aquicludes, it is essential to know the effects
   on parameter identification algorithms of thermal gradients that exist
   in these basaltic aquicludes. Temperatures of approximately 60-degrees-C
   and pressures of approximately 150 atm can be expected at potential
   repository sites located at depths of approximately 1000 m. The
   phenomenon of over-recovery has been observed in some pumping tests
   conducted at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation located in the Pasco Basin
   adjacent to the Columbia River in the state of Washington, USA. This
   over-recovery phenomenon may possibly be due to variations in the fluid
   density caused by thermal gradients. To assess the potential effects of
   these thermal gradients on indirect parameter identification algorithms,
   a systematic scaling of the governing field equations is required in
   order to obtain dimensionless equations based on the principle of
   similarity. The constitutive relationships for the specific weight of
   the fluid and for the porosity of the aquiclude are shown to be
   exponentially dependent on the pressure gradient. The dynamic pressure
   is converted to the piezometric head and the flow equation for the
   piezometric head is then scaled in radial coordinates.
   Order-of-magnitude estimates are made for all variables in unsteady flow
   for a typical well test in a basaltic aquiclude. Retaining all nonlinear
   terms, the parametric dependency of the flow equation on the classical
   dimensionless thermal and hydraulic parameters is demonstrated. These
   classical parameters include the Batchelor, Fourier, Froude, Grashof,
   and Reynolds Numbers associated with thermal flows. The flow equation is
   linearized from order-of-magnitude estimates based on these classical
   parameters for application in parameter identification algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical models of two-dimensional overland flow equations are often
   prohibitively expensive due to the highly nonlinear nature of the flow
   equations and the dense mesh required for accurate solutions. These
   models are frequently under-utilized due to lack of sufficiently
   detailed data at the grid scale. Observed results of the outflow
   hydrographs show fluctuations due to variability in the surface
   topography and precision limitations in the measuring instruments. A new
   solution methodology is presented in this paper using an eigenfunction
   expansion which is then combined with the kinematic wave approximation.
   The computational effort required by this new method is negligible when
   compared to the usual numerical methods. The results from this method
   are compared with the more expensive numerical results and
   experimentally observed results. These comparisons suggested that the
   semi-analytical solution methodology is an attractive modeling tool for
   practical two-dimensional overland flow computations.}},

Abstract = {{A new approximate random sampling method is described for numerical
   solution of the contaminant transport equation where a single uncertain
   parameter is present. The solution consists of the probability
   distribution of concentration at any point in space and time as a
   function of the uncertain parameter. The method is based on a limited
   sampling of the parameter space and subsequent interpolation of the
   information obtained at the sample points. This interpolation produces a
   complete approximation of a function that relates the random parameter
   and the concentration. The interpolation is performed using Hermite
   polynomials which require function and derivative information at each
   sample point. The theory is developed and an example of the computation
   of the distribution of concentration resulting from the distribution of
   a single effective conductivity is presented. Numerical results suggest
   that this method may be one to two orders of magnitude faster than a
   conventional Monte Carlo approach in solving this stochastic problem
   while yielding comparable accuracy.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{153-166}},
Abstract = {{Validation methods which developed in the context of deterministic
   concepts of past generations often cannot be directly applied to
   environmental problems, which may be characterized by limited
   reproducibility of results and highly complex models. Instead,
   validation is interpreted here as a series of activities, including both
   theoretical and experimental tests, designed to enhance our confidence
   in the capability of a proposed model to describe some aspect of
   reality. We examine the validation process applied to a project
   concerned with heat and fluid transport in porous media, in which
   mathematical modeling, simulation, and results of field experiments are
   evaluated in order to determine the feasibility of a system for seasonal
   thermal energy storage in shallow unsaturated soils. Technical details
   of the field experiments are not included, but appear in previous
   publications.
   Validation activities are divided into three stages. The first stage,
   carried out prior to the field experiments, is concerned with modeling
   the relevant physical processes. optimization of the heat-exchanger
   configuration and the shape of the storage volume. and multi-year
   simulation. Subjects requiring further theoretical and experimental
   study are identified at this stage. The second stage encompasses the
   planning and evaluation of the initial field experiment. Simulations are
   made to determine the experimental time scale and optimal sensor
   locations. Soil thermal parameters and temperature boundary conditions
   are estimated using an inverse method. Then results of the experiment
   are compared with model predictions using different parameter values and
   modeling approximations. In the third stage, results of an experiment
   performed under different boundary conditions are compared to
   predictions made by the models developed in the second stage.
   Various aspects of this theoretical and experimental field study are
   described as examples of the verification and validation procedure.
   There is no attempt to validate a specific model, but several models of
   increasing complexity are compared with experimental results. The
   outcome is interpreted as a demonstration of the paradigm proposed by
   van der Heijde,26 that different constituencies have different
   objectives for the validation process and therefore their acceptance
   criteria differ also.}},

Pages = {{167-173}},
Abstract = {{Most researchers agree that validation is a demonstration that a model
   is capable of making accurate predictions at a site-specific field
   setting. A successful demonstration of validation requires completion of
   a series of steps that form a modeling protocol. These steps include
   model design and calibration, and verification of the governing
   equation, the computer code, and the model itself. The strictest form of
   validation is to demonstrate that the model can accurately predict the
   future. This type of validation test has been called a postaudit.
   Results of five postaudits suggest that it will be difficult and
   probably impossible to validate groundwater models by means of a
   postaudit because it is impossible to characterize the field setting in
   sufficient detail. Attention should instead be focused on good modeling
   protocol including providing a complete description of model design, a
   thorough assessment of model calibration, and an uncertainty analysis.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{181-198}},
Abstract = {{Methods for testing, verifying, and validating predictive models of
   variably saturated groundwater flow are discussed. Specific procedures
   are introduced for measuring model complexity, assessing model
   consistency, and testing model validity. The discussion addresses
   numerical formulation, verification of internal consistency,
   benchmarking, groundtruth testing, performance measures, parameter
   estimation, hypothesis testing, and probabilistic induction.
   Verification of models includes tests of internal consistency and
   accuracy, like mass conservation and sensitivity to mesh size.
   Verification of codes also involves comparing results from the numerical
   model to analytical solutions, which are, however, limited in scope, and
   comparison with other numerical codes or `benchmarking'. These aspects
   are illustrated using available three-dimensional codes developed by the
   authors. Recognizing the diversity of spatially distributed modeling
   approaches, we also propose measures of model complexity and of the
   amount of information inherent in model predictions. One of these
   measures is the spatial degree ot' freedom, a function of material and
   boundary heterogeneities in the model. Another one is the quantity of
   information or entropy, which depends also on precision. Several aspects
   of `groundtruth' model validation using data from laboratory and field
   tests are discussed. Logical inference is used to distinguish model
   validation from refutation. Recognizing that full validation is not
   possible in practice, we formulate performance criteria to define the
   `degree of validation'. Concepts and methods based on inductive
   calculus, Bayesian hypothesis testing, and maximum likelihood, are
   analyzed in some detail as alternative model validation strategies.
   Several examples of model testing are also discussed.}},

   ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTUAL MODELS}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{199-214}},
Abstract = {{We contend that the main source of uncertainty in model predictions is
   often related to uncertainties in the conceptual model. While different
   approaches have been proposed for designing experiments so as to reduce
   the uncertainty of estimated parameters, much less attention has been
   devoted to the problem of experiment design for conceptual model
   discrimination. We propose a criterion for ensuring that a given design
   will indeed lead to data with sufficient discriminating capacity. This
   is based on finding, via automatic calibration algorithms, the minimum
   distance between simulations of the experiment obtained with the
   alternative models. If the distances thus obtained for all model
   pairings are large enough, then the proposed experiment can be used for
   effectively selecting one among those models (provided that `reality' is
   closely reproduced by one of them). This methodology is applied to a
   uranium tracer test performed on unaltered granite samples at the Paul
   Scherrer Institute and which was part of INTRAVAL test case lb. Using
   half of the data for calibrating three conceptual models shows that two
   of them cannot be rejected as valid representations of reality. We use
   the second half of data to demonstrate that they do not provide
   sufficient model discrimination capacity, despite the fact that existing
   criteria would suggest the opposite. We then proceed to propose an
   additional experiment for resolving the indetermination.}},

Pages = {{219-237}},
Abstract = {{A methodology for the design of sampling networks over space is
   proposed. The methodology is based on spatial random field
   representations of nonhomogeneous natural processes, and on optimal
   spatial estimation techniques. One of the most important results of
   random field theory for physical sciences is its rationalization of
   correlations in spatial variability of natural processes. This
   correlation is extremely important both for interpreting spatially
   distributed observations and for predictive performance. The extent of
   site sampling and the types of data to be collected will depend on the
   relationship of subsurface variability to predictive uncertainty. While
   hypothesis formulation and initial identification of spatial variability
   characteristics are based on scientific understanding (such as knowledge
   of the physics of the underlying phenomena, geological interpretations,
   intuition and experience), the support offered by field data is
   statistically modelled. This model is not limited by the geometric
   nature of sampling and covers a wide range in subsurface uncertainties.
   A factorization scheme of the sampling error variance is derived, which
   possesses certain atttactive properties allowing significant savings in
   computations. By means of this scheme, a practical sampling design
   procedure providing suitable indices of the sampling error variance is
   established. These indices can be used by way of multiobjective decision
   criteria to obtain the best sampling strategy. Neither the actual
   implementation of the in-situ sampling nor the solution of the large
   spatial estimation systems of equations are necessary. The required
   values of the accuracy parameters involved in the network design are
   derived using reference charts (readily available for various
   combinations of data configurations and spatial variability parameters)
   and certain simple yet accurate analytical formulas. Insight is gained
   by applying the proposed sampling procedure to realistic examples
   related to sampling problems in two dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents several methods which are based on multiple data

   the noise level is high, integration methods based on the trapezoidal
   rule yield better accuracy. However, when noise dominates the record,
   all methods may yield an unacceptable error. To reduce noise levels, a
   Butterworth filter is used. Using filtered data, the accuracy of the
   estimated parameters is improved. A computed example shows that the
   errors in transmissivity and storage coefficient are different because
   they have different derivatives. Application of the inverse methods are

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional numerical model is developed for the simulation of
   water flow and chemical transport through variably saturated porous
   media. The nonlinear flow equation is solved using the Galerkin finite
   element technique with the Picard iteration scheme and a continuous
   velocity field is obtained by separate application of the Galerkin
   technique to the flux equation. A two-site adsorption-desorption model
   with a first-order loss term is used to describe the chemical behavior
   of the reactive solute. The advective part of the transport equation is
   solved with one-step backward particle tracking while the dispersive
   part is solved by the regular Galerkin finite element technique.
   Preconditioned conjugate-gradient-like method is used for the iterative
   solution of the systems of linear simultaneous equations to save on
   computer memory and execution time. The model is applied to a few
   situations and the numerical results are compared with observed and
   analytic values. The model is found to work quite well, even near very
   sharp fronts.}},

Title = {{APPLICATION OF THE CONNECTION MACHINE TO FLOW AND TRANSPORT PROBLEMS IN
   3-DIMENSIONAL HETEROGENEOUS AQUIFERS}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the possibility of using the Connection Machine CM-2
   for three-dimensional groundwater flow and transport problems in
   randomly heterogeneous aquifers. The steady-state flow problem is
   discretized using traditional finite differences and a conjugate
   gradient method is used to solve the resulting algebraic system. The
   transport problem is solved using the random walk particle tracking
   method (RWPTM); both reactive and non-reactive transport is examined,
   Although both methods appear to be well suited for the Connection
   Machine (CM), the flow problem, as has been demonstrated by other
   authors, is a clear winner on the CM, achieving speed-ups of close to 3
   over the Cray Y-MP (single processor) for some problems. However, the
   RWPTM does not exhibit good performance because the heterogenity of the
   problem creates intense interprocessor communication when velocities are
   assigned to each particle. Because the particle distribution is
   non-uniform and the velocity field is large, this interprocessor
   communication is arbitrary. Simple vector valued subscripting was found
   to perform better than the several more complicated alternatives
   investigated for this communication step. Although the Cray Y-MP
   performance for the particle tracking problem was significantly better
   than the CM, it is nowhere near ideal because perfect vectorization is
   not achieved due to the large number of conditional statements (or IF
   statements) in the reactive part of the code.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the use of linear and nonlinear L1-norm
   parameter estimators to fit an analytical groundwater contaminant
   transport model with nonuniform contaminant source distributions. The

   Pollution and Hydrology, 208 Long Island Groundwater Pollution Study,
   draft report, vol. 3, Princeton University, NJ, 1978). Comparisons with
   the commonly used linear and nonlinear L2-norm estimators are conducted.
   The posterior statistical inference theory by Nyquist (Nyquist, H.,

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented for analyzing the groundwater flow through a
   shallow semiconfined aquifer with random parameters, governed by the
   Helmholtz equation and subject to stochastic boundary conditions.
   Stochasticity in an aquifer parameter is considered along with the
   stochasticity in the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. The
   hierarchical equations based on the expansion of the potential into the
   perturbation series are derived and the regular boundary element
   procedure is applied for obtaining the solutions of these equations. The
   standard.deviation in the potential is observed to increase with an
   increase in either the standard deviation in the random quantities or
   the strength of the correlation between the random quantities. The
   boundary element method based on perturbation does not require
   specification of the probability density function of the parameters but
   only their expectations, variances and the covariance of the random
   quantities. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by
   presenting a groundwater flow example as well as by comparing the
   numerical results with analytical solutions for a special case without
   the Neumann boundary condition uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers the simultaneous identification of parameters and
   source term appearing in elliptic Partial Differential Equations from
   knowledge of the reference potential, which satisfies Dirichlet boundary
   conditions. Identifying the unknowns means complying with the equation
   error criterion. The adaptive method consists of transforming both the
   potential and the unknown parameters into time-dependent quantities,
   which evolve according to given laws. In the continuum case, the time
   decay property of a Lyapunov function is shown to hold.
   Next, the finite-dimensional (Galerkin) approximation of the evolution
   equations is considered and, given the existence of a solution, the
   pertaining convergence results are stated s. t., the time-dependent
   potential approaches the reference potential and the unknowns
   asymptotically comply with the time-independent equation.
   Then, the discrete identification problem is stated. The finite element
   method is used to obtain the discrete equation error criterion. A
   Eulerian numerical scheme for all discretized evolution equations is
   provided. The sequences of the corresponding solutions i. e., the
   potential and the unknowns, are shown to converge. The detailed proof is
   provided.
   Finally, the above method is applied to the identification of hydraulic
   conductivity, leakage parameter and source term of a two-layered aquifer
   in the Aachtal (Germany) area. The numerical results obtained from
   noiseless and noisy potential data are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic calibration procedures for fitting groundwater models to

   criteria. Quadratic estimation criteria result from applying the method
   of maximum likelihood under the assumption of jointly normal errors in
   the measured head data which, for the case Of uncorrelated errors with
   constant variance, results in the ordinary least squares criterion.
   Quadratic estimation criteria are extremely sensitive to errors which
   violate the Gaussian assumption and pose an additional source of
   instability for the inverse problem. We consider the use of
   statistically robust estimation procedures to reduce these destabilizing
   effects. In particular, we test the robust M-estimator of Huber with a
   series of Monte Carlo experiments, compute the sample mean squared
   error, squared bias and variance of the estimated log-hydraulic
   conductivities for realizations of head measurements contaminated with
   mixed normal noise and compare these measures to their counterparts for
   the OLS estimator. We show that Huber's M-estimator achieves the same

Abstract = {{The problem of estimating log-transmissivity when it is assumed to be a
   random field can be faced using indirect iterative methods or using the
   so-called geostatistical approach. A close examination of the two
   formulations suggests that basic assumptions are similar. In fact, if
   the iterative method is stopped after one iteration of a Gauss-Newton
   method, starting from the mean log-T, we show that both estimates and
   estimation covariance matrices obtained with the two approaches are
   identical. We then argue that the main difference between the two
   formulations arises from the way linearization is performed, which is
   global in non-iterative methods and only local in iterative methods. As
   a result, the latter are less constrained by linearity than the former
   and lead to better estimates and to more consistent estimation
   covariance matrices. This is illustrated with two synthetic examples for
   several degrees of spatial variability.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented to estimate smoothly varying (as opposed to zoned)
   hydraulic parameters, transmissivity in particular, appearing in a
   time-dependent flow equation. A finite difference model based on a
   nested grid discretization reduces the computational effort while
   allowing local refinement. Structuring of the unknown parameter field,
   use of a priori information, and parameterization of the inverse problem
   are geostatistically based. Calibration is carried out by minimizing a
   quadratic objective function depending on head data. A primal-adjoint
   discrete-gradient method is used, where the unknowns are parameter
   values at a number of user-defined points, the ``Pilot points{''}. The
   key feature of this method consists of kriging together the pilot point
   values and the measured values, if any, in order to generate the
   parameter field needed at each iteration to solve the primal and adjoint
   systems. Minimization is performed by a BFGS algorithm. Two numerical
   examples are considered, where transmissivity is the unknown. The first
   one is adapted from Carrera and Neuman s{[}1] synthetic problem. The
   purpose is to compare kriged and zoned results obtained from different,
   types of observation data sets e.g., stationary vs. transient head or
   drawdown. The second example is a case study of the Dijon (France)
   aquifer. Pilot point-based identification is applied to the same model
   (domain, equations, grid), which was manually calibrated in 1985. Only
   the measured data were made available. The results from manual
   calibration were kept unknown until the end of the inversion trials.
   Sensible use of pilot points and of a priori information appears to play
   a key role in yielding plausible results.}},

   of the head residuals with respect to the concentration residuals was
   established through an iterative technique to equalize the variances of
   the two residual populations. Statistical analyses indicate that the

   data are more certain than estimates obtained by matching concentration
   data alone. The significance of this greater certainty is demonstrated
   by translating parameter uncertainty into concentration prediction

Abstract = {{A vertically integrated two-dimensional lateral flow model of soil
   moisture has been developed.  Derivation of the governing equation is
   based on a physical interpretation of hillslope processes.  The lateral
   subsurface-flow model permits variability of precipitation and
   evapotranspiration, and allows arbitrary specification of soil-moisture
   retention properties.  Variable slope, soil thickness, and saturation
   are all accommodated.  The numerical solution method, a Crank-Nicolson,
   finite-difference, upstream-weighted scheme, is simple and robust.  A
   small catchment in northeastern Kansas is the subject of an application
   of the lateral subsurface-flow model.  Calibration of the model using
   observed discharge provides estimates of the active porosity (0.1
   cm3/cm3) and of the saturated horizontal hydraulic conductivity (40
   cm/hr).  The latter figure is at least an order of magnitude greater
   than the vertical hydraulic conductivity associated with the silty clay
   loam soil matrix.  The large value of hydraulic conductivity derived
   from the calibration is suggestive of macropore-dominated hillslope
   drainage.  The corresponding value of active porosity agrees well with a

Abstract = {{In this paper an attempt is made towards the generalization and
   summarisation of up-to-date research work in the field of simplified
   flood routing models derived from the linearized St. Venant equation. 
   The case of a uniform wide-open channel with an arbitrary cross section
   and friction law is considered.  The characteristic equation for
   deriving the cumulants of the IUH is used, which is applicable only when
   one boundary condition is active only.  Introduced in the paper is a
   method for evaluation of cumulants which allows the substitution rules
   for the second-order derivatives of the linearized St. Venant equation
   under the condition of cumulants equivalence to be formulated. 
   Depending on the number of equivalent cumulants, three kinds of models
   originating from the St. Venant equation are specified.  The families of
   simplified models belonging to each class are derived using the
   substitution rules.  Examples of applications are given.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on two alternating directions splitting algorithms,
   one cast in the Local One Dimensional (LOD) and the other in the
   standard Fractional Time Stepping (FTS) format.  Both algorithms employ
   an adaptation of the pseudo-viscosity technique and use the principal
   directions of transport as coordinates.  In the LOD approach, only one
   dimension appears in each splitting step.  In the FTS method,
   computation is implicit in only one dimension but other dimensions are
   present in each splitting step.  Stability and accuracy constraints on
   the grid parameters are diagrammed for both schemes.  Test problems in
   one and two dimensions are solved.  The analysis shows that the slight
   accuracy advantage of the FTS format over the LOD format must be traded
   off against tighter grid design prescriptions and, frequently, also
   against higher computing cost.}},

Abstract = {{A problem consisting of the determination of the optimal discharge
   hydrograph of a pumping station located at the downstream end of a storm
   drainage channel subject to time-varying inflow, is described.  The goal
   of the pumping station operational strategy is to always maintain the
   minimum amount of water stored in the channel by maximizing the
   instantaneous pumped flow rate.  The equations of water motion in the
   channel and the design and operational constraints are approximated by
   employing a quasilinear time integration scheme and a staggered spatial
   discretization.  The resulting discrete equations are linear in the
   unknown values of the flow variables.  Accordingly, the computation of
   the optimal pumped flow rate is formulated as a linear programming
   problem for each time step.  An efficient solution algorithm is
   developed on the basis of the particular structure of the dynamic and
   operational constraints associated with the problem of interest.  A
   numerical example that illustrates the application of the proposed
   procedure is presented.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-grid algorithm has been developed to accelerate the convergence
   solution of the open channel flow equations to obtain the steady flow. 
   The scheme is constructed by combining the multiple-grid technique with
   a new marching finite-volume numerical solution.  In the multi-grid
   application the corrections to the fine grid points are transferred to a
   coarse grid to maintain the low truncation errors associated with a fine
   level of discretizations.  Distribution formulae are then used to
   propagate the changes onto selected coarser grid points.  After applying
   interpolation to coarse grid corrections, the flow properties at every
   grid point of the fine mesh are updated.  The channel flow will be
   assumed to be 2D, steady and viscous with wind and Coriolis forces
   neglected.  The flow is also assumed to be fully mixed in the vertical
   direction.  The general technique used is a combination of the
   finite-element and finite-difference methods.  The governing PDE are
   transformed into an equivalent system applied over a square-grid
   network.  Convergence histories are presented for supercritical flows as
   well as for super-critical flows with hydraulic jump presence. 
   Numerical results indicate that substantial computational savings for
   the solution accuracy can be achieved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of identifying unknown nonlinear coefficients in a one
   dimensional diffusion equation is considered.  It is shown that these
   coefficients can be recovered from ``correct{''} overposed data.  The
   main analytical tools used are the maximum principle and monotonicity,
   both of the underlying operator and of the overposed data.  In some
   cases a naturally induced fixed point formulation results, while in
   other cases a collocation method is induced and this yields a unique
   piecewise linear function approximation to the undetermined coefficient.
    The results of some numerical simulations are given.}},

Abstract = {{A channel or a foundation dug in an aquifer causes the drawdown of the

   the problem lies mainly in land reclamation and building foundation
   problems.  This paper deals with the computation of the discharge
   collected by a partially penetrating ditch in anisotropic homogeneous
   soil.  The cross section of the ditch is assumed rectangular, the
   groundwater flow steady, and the water level inside the ditch null.  In
   the isotropic case a new analytical solution is obtained by means of the
   Schwarz-Christoffel transformation.  In case of anisotropic soil a
   numerical finite element solution is also presented that is of practical
   significance, together with a discussion of the seepage surface. 
   Previous solutions, proposed in literature, are critically examined in
   comparison with the present findings.  It is demonstrated that the
   proposed numerical solution provides a general and reliable tool.}},

Abstract = {{Space and space-time filtering approaches for the numerical simulation
   of turbulent flow are described.  Space-time filtering is presented as
   an attractive option for geophysical applications in which the scales of
   interest are large, not only in space, but also in time.  It is argued
   that the space-time filtering procedure must rely on the use of
   non-integral approximations of the nonlinear terms that appear as a
   result of filtering the instantaneous advective terms in the
   Navier-Stokes equations.  Accordingly, the generalization of the Leonard
   approximation in the framework of space-time filtering is described.  In
   addition, an approximation for the cross terms is derived through
   theoretically justifiable arguments, by employing a Gaussian filter. 
   The mathematical nature of the Leonard and cross terms approximations is
   investigated in physical and Fourier space.  It is concluded that the
   series that give rise to both approximations have an asymptotic nature
   in a small parameter defined as the ratio of the smallest (numerically)
   resolvable scales and the dominant scales of the filtered velocity
   field.  It is also shown that both approximations are equivalent to
   approximating the Gaussian filter by an osculating paraboloid in Fourier
   space.  Finally, the filtering effect of numerical discretizations is
   examined.  Since space filtering is a particular case of space-time
   filtering, the conclusions obtained in this paper are also valid in the
   LES context.}},
