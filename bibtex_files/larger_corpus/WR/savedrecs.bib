Abstract = {{A one-dimensional numerical model is presented for the description of
   water quality in rivers. The model is an improvement over existing
   models, since it involves two differential schemes of third-order
   truncation error (QUICK and QUICKEST), which avoid the stability
   problems of central difference, while remaining relatively free of the
   inaccuracies of numerical dispersion associated with the upwind
   difference scheme. The model is successfully applied to four simple,
   steady-state and transient water quality problems. Results show that the
   commonly used upwind scheme performs very poorly. The central difference
   scheme performs satisfactorily in steady-state implicit calculations,
   but not in transient problems, where it shows numerical dispersion and
   significant oscillations Calculations with QUICK and QUICKEST are stable
   and accurate involving the minimum error and minimum level of numerical
   dispersion in both steady-state and transient problems.}},

Abstract = {{The paper examines the importance of suspended particle size
   distribution in deep bed filtration. Experiments were conducted with
   suspensions of different size distributions. The changes in total
   concentration, concentrations of particles of different sizes and the
   headloss were observed. The suspension with the largest mean particle
   size gave the greatest removal. It was also observed that the size
   distribution changed with depth and time, and this was shown to be
   crucial in understanding filter behaviour. It was concluded that in
   modelling filter performance it is not sufficient to use the mean
   characteristics of the influent suspension. Some evidence was found for
   the interaction between particles of different sizes, and the particle
   size distribution also affects the distribution of deposit throughout
   the bed.}},

Abstract = {{The dependency of free halogen ion oxidation in chemical oxygen demand

   Halogen interference was reduced at increasing glucose or potassium
   hydrogen phthalate concentration; in each case, a threshold ratio of
   organic matter to halogen existed, above which halogen oxidation was
   masked. This ratio depended upon the presence of mercuric sulfate in the
   case of chloride but not of bromide. It was also affected by the ease of
   oxidation of both the organic molecule and the halogen ion, as well as
   by their actual COD. Thus, bromide oxidation was more difficult to
   prevent than that of chloride, and phthalate exerted a stronger masking
   effect than glucose.}},

Abstract = {{It was shown thal Ca2+ can be extracted from activated sludge from a
   plant with biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal either by an ion
   exchange process, where H+, Na+, K+ or Mg2+ served as counter ions, or
   by chelation by EGTA. The extraction of Ca2+ led to an increase in the
   number of small particles and subsequently an increase in the specific
   resistance to filtration.
   It was argued that approx. half of the total Ca2+ pool was associated
   with the exopolymers and thereby formed an alginate-like gel, which
   constituted the backbone of the floc structure This notion was further
   emphasized by the observation that addition of Cu2+ which, along with
   releasing Ca2+, improved the dewaterability-probably because of the Cu2+
   ions ability to maintain the three-dimensional structure of the
   exopolymers.}},

Abstract = {{Eight sediment cores from Hebe Haven were collected and studied for
   metals including Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn and Ca.  Pb-210 and Cs-137
   activities were determined to date the time of deposition of the
   sediment. Hebe Haven is a yacht area and is close to the urbanized coast
   with several dyeing factories. Except Cd, the greatest enrichment was
   found at locations closest to the Ho Chung Stream which carried domestic
   and industrial wastewater to Hebe Haven. Concentrations as high as
   0.930, 120, 131, 42.3 and 50.9 mg/kg were found for Cd, Cr, Zn, Cu and
   Pb, respectively. The corresponding enrichment factors are 13(Cd),
   7.0(Cr), 2.9(Zn), 5.2(Cu) and 2.4(Pb). The extent of pollution
   diminishes from the riverine source. Cr is a typical example because its
   enrichment was mostly attributed to the nearby dyeing operation. The
   distribution of Cd appears more complicated. A maximum concentration of
   3.60 mg/kg was found at a location far from Ho Chung Stream and with no
   nearby municipal or industrial activity. No significant Fe and Ni
   enrichment was found in the area. Ca in all cores decreases towards the
   sediment-water interface. It is probable that the abundance of shellfish
   has decreased as a result of excessive exploitation as seafood and
   pollution.  Pb-210 activity and heavy metal concentrations of surficial
   layers have been ``diluted{''} by excessive deposition of Fe-deficient
   particles. This likely indicates the rapid deposition of coarser and
   sandy particles during the construction of a nearby large housing
   estate. Some Pb-210 activity profiles have periodic low values in deeper
   layers, which should correspond to events of rapid deposition of erosion
   during heavy typhoons and rainstorms. Overall, the sedimentation rates
   calculated were in the range of 0.351-0.561 cm/yr. In one site (Core S4)
   close to the riverine source and with the best available dating data,
   the recent anthropogenic fluxes of heavy metals in mug cm-2 yr-1 are
   estimated as: 0.081(Cd), 22(Cr), 20(Zn), 6.4(Cu) and 7.4(Pb).}},

Abstract = {{Fish inhabiting fecally polluted bodies of water are often used for
   human consumption. Such fish can be contaminated by enteric human
   pathogens and may pose a potential risk to public health. Controlled
   experiments with 132 fish of 100 g average weight were conducted to
   evaluate the rate of contamination of various tissues of fish (tilapia
   hybrids). The fish were exposed to E. coli introduced into the ambient
   water at concentrations of up to 10(6) cfu/ml. Additional experiments
   were conducted with diluted wastewater containing Aeromonas,
   enterococci, fecal coliform and F+ coliphages. In another experiment
   poliovirus 1 was also added. The highest bacterial concentrations were
   recovered from the digestive tract (DT), some 5-24 h following exposure,
   with DT levels essentially similar to those in the inoculated water. In
   the E. coli experiments, geometric mean levels of about 10(2) cfu/cm2
   were recovered from the skin, 26 cfu/g in the spleen and 10(2) cfu/g in
   the liver. Most of the muscle samples were not contaminated. Greater
   contamination was not found under conditions of stress such as high
   organic load, a water temperature of 37-degrees-C or low levels of
   dissolved oxygen.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of turbulence on nitrifying biofilms was studied in five
   cylindrical PVC (polyvinyl chloride) reactors, each having ten biofilm
   sampling taps, over a period of 196 days. Bulk water in the reactors was
   stirred by paddles at 32, 92, 140, 278 and 500 rpm and the turbulent
   intensities measured at 10 mm from the wall were 0.6, 1.5, 2.6, 4.4 and
   8.9 cm/s. Biofilms appeared as isolated colonies and continued to grow
   as filament-type biofilms. Higher turbulence resulted in higher NH4-N
   flux and higher areal biomass density. Turbulent diffusion of substrates
   and by-products in the vicinity of filament-type biofilms must have
   resulted in the above phenomena. Photographic observation of the biofilm
   surfaces on sampling taps showed uniform biofilm filaments at higher
   turbulent intensities and large variation in the height of filaments at
   low turbulent intensities. Substrate flux and biofilm structure (areal
   density, filament height and cross-sectional area of filament) are
   inter-related parameters and are strongly affected by turbulence near
   the biofilm. Substrate flux is expressed as a power function of
   turbulent intensity, volumetric density and substrate concentration for
   filament-type biofilm when substrates are non-limiting.}},

   conditions: pressure = 20 bar, temperature = 20-degrees-C and
   circulation velocity = 2 m/s. The results show the nanofiltration
   feasibility. For the three membranes the rejection factors of
   chlorinated organic compounds are greater than 95\% and two of them
   present permeate fluxes of approx. 42 kg/hm2. Several reference solutes
   with a wide range of molecular weights and functional groups were also
   permeated. Their results compared with those of mill effluent allow us
   to conclude that the effluent tannic compounds are not in a fouling form
   and that the majority of the organochlorinated matter has a molecular

Abstract = {{Humic substances constitute a major fraction of dissolved organic matter
   in natural water and effluents. Their effect on the adsorption of
   organic contaminants to aquifer material was elucidated, and a model was
   proposed for the adsorption of organic solutes to aquifer solids in the
   presence of dissolved humic substances. The model is based on the
   assumption that organic solute binds to dissolved humic substances in a
   reversible manner to form a solute humate complex. Following binding,
   both free and bound fractions of the organic solute are independently
   adsorbed onto the solid phase. In order to evaluate the validity of the
   model, the following parameters were determined: (1) the adsorption
   coefficient of the organic solute to clay; (2) the binding constant of
   the solute humate complex; and (3) the adsorption of humic acid (HA) to
   clay, assuming that the solute humate complex is adsorbed similarly to
   humic acid itself. Using these parameters in the model enabled the
   effect of dissolved humic substances on adsorption to be evaluated.
   Experimental results obtained for the adsorption of fluoranthene (a
   model compound of the PAH group) to clay in the presence of dissolved HA
   were compared with calculated values derived from the model described
   above. The sensitivity of the model to various parameters was evaluated
   and a prediction was made with respect to the effect of dissolved humic
   substances on the adsorption of a variety of organic solutes. It appears
   that dissolved humic substances solubilize organic solutes which have
   higher adsorption coefficients to clay than humic substances, but
   increase the adsorption of solutes having lower adsorption coefficients
   relative to humic substances.}},

Abstract = {{Literature data about the photochemistry of oxychlorine compounds in
   aqueous solutions (flash photolysis, pulse radiolysis, solar radiation)
   indicate that the products (ClO, Cl, O, O-,...) generated from the
   primary photochemical reactions of decomposition of chlorine dioxide and

   formation of many secondary products (Cl2O2, Cl2O3, ClO-,...) and of
   chlorate, chloride and molecular oxygen as end-products (Table 1). The
   aim of this work was to study the photodecomposition of aqueous
   solutions of chlorine dioxide and chlorite in u.v. reactors equipped
   with low pressure mercury vapour lamps in order to show the effects of
   pH and of the initial concentrations on the nature of photoproducts and
   on the rate of photodecomposition of ClO2 and ClO2-. This paper presents
   the data obtained for the identification of photoproducts. The kinetics
   of photodecomposition will be presented in another paper (Part II).}},

   effect on Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter obtained using the model with and
   without diffusional limitation terms. A sensitivity analysis revealed
   the results were affected by uncertainties in assigning values to the
   kinetic coefficients, but the probability for significant diffusional
   limitation was high The significance of the model was demonstrated
   through computer simulation where the interaction between the floc

Abstract = {{Toxicological modification of molluscan mucus production has largely
   been ignored. This is probably due to an underestimation of the role of
   mucus in molluscan physiology and its energetic cost. This paper reports
   that laboratory exposure to episodic doses of waterborne copper and zinc
   serve to reduce pedal mucus production by the common limpet Patella
   vulgata L. to about 60\% of the unstressed rate. The metals are
   effective in this respect at concentrations as low as 10 mug l-1. which
   in the case of zinc is below the current U.K, environmental quality
   standard. All metal doses reduced mucus production to the same level.
   This suggests a behavioural response of the limpet, limiting activity.
   The reduction in mucus production has important consequences both for
   limpet ecology and for the ways in which biological energy allocation
   and transformation are assessed.}},

Abstract = {{An improved technique for the physical stabilization of microbial
   aggregates, by embedding them in solidified agar, is recommended for
   light microscopy studies such as the measurement of size and the
   evaluation of morphological parameters. This technique involves an
   application of membrane filtered agar and allows the use of an image
   analysis system for observations of aggregates down to the size of
   individual cells.
   Embedding in agar is not satisfactory for microtome sectioning of
   microbial aggregates. Instead of the previously studied method of
   embedding in paraffin, embedding in glycol methacrylate resin has been
   found more advantageous. The latter technique is much simpler and
   provides better, unperturbed specimens.}},

Abstract = {{Significant amounts of Fe(II) in river water exist as a fulvic-Fe
   complex even under oxic conditions. However, only small amounts of
   Fe(II) are detected even at pH 5.5 when a color complexing reagent
   commonly used for measuring Fe(II) is directly added to filtered samples
   without prior treatment. This situation might be attributed to the
   presence of fulvic acid, a main fraction of dissolved organic matter in
   river water, which forms a very stable fulvic acid-Fe(II) complex.
   In order to separate Fe(II) from the fulvic acid-Fe(II) complex, a
   filtered water sample is initially passed through a silica column coated
   with 8-hydroxyquinoline. The Fe(II) is eluted by an acid solution and
   determined spectrophotometrically by
   nitroso-5-(N-propyl-N-sulfopropylamine) phenol (PSAP) reagent specific
   for Fe(II). The Fe(II) determined by this method was greater than 70\%
   of the total dissolved iron in river water with high total organic
   carbon (TOC).}},

Abstract = {{An experiment concerning the land application of wastewater was
   conducted using three lysimeters in which G (gravitational permeation),
   C (capillary permeation) and E (evapotranspiration) type trenches were
   separately set. The lysimeter was 100 cm long, 200 cm wide and 150 cm
   deep and was packed with volcanic ash soil. Wastewater used in this
   experiment was taken from an exhausting pit of the clarifier for human
   waste. The wastewater from the clarifier was applied to the trenches at
   a rate of 501 m-1 d-1. The removal efficiency of BOD, COD and TP in soil
   water versus the wastewater showed more than 90\%, however, that of TN
   was less than 50\% in every type of trench. A remarkable increase in
   NO3-N was observed both in soil water and in the soil to which the
   wastewater was applied. Comparing the amount of denitrification between
   the G and C type trenches during the experimental period, the amount of
   the latter showed 325 g though that of the former was only 146 g under
   the conditions that the total amount of inflow in TN was 1070 g. The
   amount of TN increase in the lysimeter in which a C type trench was
   buried was only 53 g though that in the G type trench was 172 g during
   the experimental period. From these results, it was concluded that the C
   type trench was more effective in removing nitrogen in land application
   of wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism involved in the decrease of phosphate in a high rate pond
   (HRP) is investigated. The calcium concentration in the water (1.25-3.75

   hydroxyapatite {[}Ca5(PO4)3OH, pK(s) = 571 is the thermodynamical stable
   state, the phosphate concentration is determined by the solubility of
   the amorphous tricalcium phosphate {[}Ca3(PO4)2, PK(s) = 25.2]. This is
   confirmed by the calculation of the theoretical predicted solubility as
   well as various experiments. The relationship between pH and phosphate
   concentration may be used to optimize the efficiency of this type of
   reactor to produce a minimum concentration of phosphate in the effluent.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{When analyzing aromatic constituents of humic substances, should
   potassium permanganate (KMnO4) be used directly for the release of these
   constituents, aromatic rings possessing hydroxyl groups may easily be
   decomposed. As a means for stabilizing these compounds, methylation
   before KMnO4 oxidation (premethylation) was conducted and the results
   were investigated.
   28 different aromatic model compounds having hydroxyl and/or carboxyl
   groups were used as aromatic model compounds of constituents of humic
   substances. The recovery of these compounds and their methylated
   compounds after KMnO4 oxidation was assessed quantitatively. The
   reaction temperature of KMnO4 oxidation was 50-degrees-C. In the
   oxidation of non-methylated compounds, those having at least one
   hydroxyl group were easily decomposed by KMnO4 oxidation, but for those
   with only a carboxyl group, stability was retained, except for
   terephthalic acid. In the oxidation of methylated compounds, many of
   those possessing carboxyl and hydroxyl groups could be stabilized by
   methylation, while those possessing only the hydroxyl group or
   substituted by two hydroxyl groups at the mutually meta - and
   para-positions with no intervening substitution groups, easily underwent
   decomposition even if methylated.
   Assessment of the applicability of the premethylation technique was made
   for more complex compounds. Two tannic compounds, (+)-catechin and
   penta-G-glucose, were used for this purpose, since their chemical
   structures are well known. Following premethylation, they were
   decomposed by KMnO4 and then remethylated by dimethyl sulfate and
   potassium carbonate. GC/MS was used for the analysis of oxidation
   products. Compounds which could be predicted from the structure of
   original compounds were obtained in high yields.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic loading rate is the key parameter of a slow-rate land
   treatment system (SR-LTS). It is crop-, soil-, site- and
   wastewater-specific. The design of hydraulic loading rates for the paddy
   rice SR-LTS is presented in this paper after the first pilot-scale paddy
   rice SR-LTS (about 7 ha) in Shenyang city, northeast China, had
   successfully operated for 4 years. The daily percolation rate is a
   critical factor for calculating the hydraulic output. This was found to
   be 10-20\% of the minimum soil permeability which is usually that of the
   plough pan in the soil profile of the paddy fields. For municipal
   wastewater or sewage, the hydraulic loading rate, based on the hydraulic
   assimilative capacity of the plant-soil system, was the limiting
   hydraulic loading rate in the area if the nitrogen concentration in the
   influent was less than 25 mg/l. An annual hydraulic loading rate of
   around 200 cm/yr was found to be appropriate.}},

Abstract = {{This second paper presents the hydraulic balances and operation results
   of the main paddy rice SR-LTS and supplemental non-paddy rice SR-LTS
   after 4 years successful operation. The actual hydraulic loading rates
   for the rice growth stage were very close to the design value of 200.8
   cm/yr. Up to half of the hydraulic loading was recovered as infiltration
   effluent to the surface water and used as reclaimed water resources.
   BOD5, COD(Cr), TP and TN concentrations in the effluent were less than
   5, 36, 0.2 and 6 mg/l and their removal rates were greater than 95, 84,
   90 and 72\%, respectively, in terms of 4 year averages. Trace organic
   chemicals were removed significantly and there was no obvious difference
   in their concentrations in rice between SR-LTS and clean water
   irrigation. With a supplemental SR-LTS occupying an area of only 10\% of
   the field area of the main SR-LTS, the system could operate throughout
   the whole growth period with a constant wastewater treatment flow and
   without storage.}},

Abstract = {{ATP content, oxygen utilization rate (OUR) and fluorescein diacetate
   (FDA) hydrolysis were tested for the ability to express the amount of
   viable biomass in wastewater and activated sludge.
   The relationship between biomass and these activity parameters was
   established in growth cultures made by inoculating a nutrient medium
   with either wastewater or activated sludge. Biomass was then determined
   directly by measurement of dry weight of growth culture (dw), and
   compared to data obtained by using the previously mentioned methods. In
   the exponential growth phase, ATP content showed the best correlation
   with biomass, while FDA hydrolysis in the sludge failed to show any such
   correlation. Conversion factors of 3 mg ATP/g dw, 300 mg O2/h g dw and
   0.4 A/h (mg dw/ml) for ATP, OUR and FDA methods, respectively, were
   calculated.
   When the methods were applied for in situ determinations in four
   different wastewater plants, it was found that ATP content and
   respiration rate estimated viable biomass to range from 81 to 293 mg
   dw/g SS for raw wastewater and from 67 to 187 mg dw/g SS for activated
   sludge with a rather weak correlation between ATP and respiration
   measurements. The FDA hydrolysis estimated viable biomass to be higher
   than suspended solids, for which reason this parameter could not be
   recommended for determination of viable biomass in wastewater and
   activated sludge.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of iron complexed by various organic compounds was investigated
   as a function of both oxidative and coagulation removal methods. Organic
   compounds evaluated included humic and fulvic acids, tannic acid and
   oxalic acid. Oxidants evaluated were potassium permanganate, chlorine
   dioxide and free chlorine. Both laboratory-scale and field monitoring
   studies were undertaken. Selected samples were analyzed for DOC
   molecular weight to evaluate how changes in this parameter affected the
   efficiency of soluble iron removal by either oxidation or alum
   coagulation.
   Higher molecular weight DOC sources (e.g. humic and tannic acids)
   resulted in a high degree of ferrous iron complexation. Such
   complexation rendered the iron stable against the addition of each of
   the oxidants considered. Potassium permanganate was found to be the most
   effective oxidant of the three investigated. Free chlorine and chlorine
   dioxide were ineffective for iron removal for all DOC sources except
   oxalate. Alum coagulation under pH 6.0-6.3 conditions was very effective
   for promoting iron removal when the iron was complexed by high molecular
   weight DOC compounds.}},

   collected from the southern part of Lake Saimaa, SE Finland, receiving
   BKME revealed higher binding capacities to all of the three model
   compounds than natural DOM in water upstream from the pulp mill. An
   important phenomenon related to the environmental transport and fate of
   xenobiotics was almost the full reversibility of the binding between
   chlorolignin and model compounds. The obtained K(p) values of
   chlorolignin after a 4 day dissociation period were 12.6 x 10(5) and 4.6

   In short-term (24 h) accumulation experiments with Daphnia magna the
   effects of kraft lignin and chlorolignin on the bioavailability of three

   xenobiotics in the chlorolignin containing water (DOC = 10 mg C/l) were
   20-30 and 25-35 \% of those organic-free control and upstream reference

Abstract = {{The ozonation of nitrogenous heterocyclic compounds (uracil, barbituric
   acid, iso-dialuric acid, dialuric acid and hydantoin) as examined for
   the oxidation products in aqueous solution (pH 3-8). It has been
   demonstrated in all cases that the oxidative attack takes place on C5 or
   C6 while, depending on the pH, stable six-ring compounds, such as
   alloxan, five-ring compounds, such as parabanic acid and alloxanic acid,
   as well as ring-opening products, such as formyloxaluric acid, oxaluric
   acid and formic acid are formed. In some cases, hydrogen peroxide was
   detected as the inorganic product. The oxidation of hydantoin causes a
   quantitative production of parabanic acid in acid solution, whereas at
   pH 7 ring-opening takes place and oxaluric acid has been detected as the
   product of oxidation. From the carbon balances made it can be assumed
   that more than 90\% of the products have been detected.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile and bound trace metals associated with sediment components (viz.
   exchangeable, carbonate, organic, Fe/Mn oxide and residual fractions)
   were determined at five locations on the River Ganges in the lower
   reaches. In the exchangeable phase, 5-22\% of Pb, 5-14.4\% of Cr,
   3-16.4\% of Cd, 3-16\% of Zn and 1-13.5\% of Cu were found, and in the
   carbonate phase 73-87\% of Zn, 38-41\% of Cd, 13-27\% of Ni and 3-10.1\%
   of Pb were found. The Fe/Mn oxide phase retained about 79-83\% of Mn,
   30-40\% of Cr and Fe, 22-25\% of Cu, 14-16\% of Ni and 9-11 \% of Pb. In
   the organic phase about 36-47\% of Cd, 22-28\% of Cu and 10-15\% of Pb
   were found. The order of release of metals was Cd > Cr > Pb > Cu > Zn >
   Ni > Mn > Fe, and the order of adsorption characteristics of most of the
   mobile metal fractions was Fe/Mn oxide > organic > clay. Correlations of
   the physico-chemical parameters with adsorption characteristics were
   also determined and a good correlation (r = 0.7) of cation exchange
   capacity with the clay fraction was found. I(geo) (geoaccumulation
   indices) of metals in the sediments were also evaluated. Results showed
   a considerable enrichment of trace metals in the sediment phase at
   almost all the sites.}},

Abstract = {{The geographic distribution, density, species composition, food habits
   and route of invasion of aquatic oribatid and astigmatid mites in
   swimming pools were studied. These animals occurred in 53\% of the
   indoor swimming pools tested. Oribatids were found only in a restricted
   area, while astigmatids were widely distributed throughout Japan. The
   identified species were Hydronothrus crispus Aoki in four pools,
   Trimalaconothrus maniculatus Fain et Lambrechts in four and Histiostoma
   ocellatum Fain et Lambrechts in 15 of 36 pools. Mite faunas were usually
   very simple, being of a single species; if other species were found to
   co-exist they were few in number. The highest density determined by our
   tests was less than 50 individuals/m2. To clarify the route of invasion
   to the pools, 50-100 m3 of the water entering a pool was screened
   through a nylon mesh. Mites found in the residue on the screen were of
   the same species as those found in the swimming pools.}},

Abstract = {{In the absence of a suitable method for routine analysis of large
   numbers of natural river water samples for organic nitrogen and
   phosphorus fractions, a new simultaneous digestion technique was
   developed, based on a standard persulphate digestion procedure. This
   allows rapid analysis of river, lake and groundwater samples from a
   range of environments for total nitrogen and phosphorus.
   The method was evaluated using a range of organic nitrogen and
   phosphorus structures tested at low, mid and high range concentrations
   from 2 to 50 mg l-1 nitrogen and 0.2 to 10 mg l-1 phosphorus. Mean
   recoveries for nitrogen ranged from 94.5\% (2 mg l-1) to 92.7\% (50 mg
   l-1) and for phosphorus were 98.2\% (0.2 mg l-1) to 100.2\% (10 mg l-1).
   The method is precise in its ability to reproduce results from replicate
   digestions, and robust in its ability to handle a variety of natural
   water samples in the pH range 5-8.}},

Abstract = {{A bench-scale experiment was conducted in a 70 l. tank of tap water to
   examine the effect of three design variables on oxygen transfer in a
   coarse bubble diffused aeration system. The experiment used non-steady
   state gas transfer methodology to examine the effect of orifice
   diameter, air flow rate and reduced tank surface ama on the overall
   oxygen transfer coefficient (K(L)a20, h-1); standard oxygen transfer
   rate (OT(s), g O2 h-1); energy efficiency (E(p), g O2 kW h-1) and oxygen
   transfer efficiency (E(o), \%). The experiments demonstrated that
   K(L)a20 and OT(s) increased 122\% when air flow rate was doubled
   (9.4-18.81 min-1), while E(o) and E(p) increased approx. 12\%. A
   reduction in orifice diameter from 3175-mu-m (3.2 mm) to 1588-mu-m (1.6
   mm) to 794-mu-m (0.8 mm) to 397-mu-m (0.4 mm) significantly increased
   K(L)a20, OT(s), E(p) and E(o). The presence of a floating surface cover
   had no effect on K(L)a20 and OT(s), and a marginal decrease in E(p) and
   E(o). The mean bubble sizes produced by the 397, 794, 1588 and 3175-mu-m
   diffusers were 4.7, 6.6, 7.7 and 7.2 mm dia, respectively. There was no
   significant effect of air flow rate on bubble size within the range of
   air flow rates used in this experiment. A comparison of this study's
   coarse bubble results with a concurrent study on fine pore (fine bubble)
   aeration reveals that K(L)a, OT(s), E(p) and E(o) continue to increase
   as orifice diameter is decreased to the 40-140-mu-m (i.e. fine pore)
   diameter range. The most efficient coarse bubble diffuser (i.e.
   397-mu-m) was approx. 68\% as efficient as the 140-mu-m fine pore
   diffuser. A classification system using existing EPA bubble size
   criterion for coarse and fine bubble diffusers, and the aeration
   systems' operational response of E(p) and E(o) to increased air flow
   rates is recommended for differentiating coarse and fine bubble diffused
   aeration systems.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic treatment of thermomechanical pulping whitewater was studied
   in semicontinuously fed batch digesters at 35, 55 and 65-degrees-C, and
   in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors at 55 and
   70-degrees-C. Also post-treatment of the 55-degrees-C UASB effluent by
   thermophilic activated sludge process and by acid precipitation was
   investigated. The batch digester studies demonstrated treatability of
   whitewater at all applied temperatures. In UASB reactors up to 65-75\%
   COD removal was obtained at 55-degrees-C at loading rates of 14-22 kg
   COD m-3d-1. About 60\% COD removal was maintained at 55-degrees-C in the
   UASB reactor at a loading rate as high as 80 kg COD m-3d-1, which
   corresponded with a hydraulic retention time of 55 min. In the UASB
   reactor at 70-degrees-C, loading rates of about 13 kg COD m-3d-1 were
   reached with about 60\% COD removal. Both the batch and UASB studies
   showed increased effluent residual COD at increasing treatment
   temperatures. Compounds other than volatile fatty acids and
   carbohydrates accounted for most of the COD increment. Activated sludge
   process and acid precipitation further removed the COD present in the
   anaerobically treated whitewater.}},

Abstract = {{The need for economic optimization of a filter unit leading to its least
   cost design with respect to filtration velocity, run time, depth and
   medium size has long been identified but there are no algorithms towards
   this end. In this study, an algorithm incorporating a NLP (non-linear
   programming) software (NPSOL-System Optimization Laboratory, Stanford
   University, Calif.) and response surface methodology (RSM) is presented
   for optimal design and operation of a filter unit. Also, the simulation
   model included in the optimization takes into account the polydispersity
   of the influent. The optimization results obtained using laboratory data
   have shown that the filter design and operating parameters are highly
   dependent on the particle size distribution (PSD) of the influent. The
   cost of the filter unit with influent having the same total particles
   mass concentration and turbidity but with greater fraction of fine
   particles was about 46\% higher. This demonstrates the importance of
   incorporating PSD instead of suspended solids (SS), turbidity units (TU)
   or volume average diameter in the design and operation of filter units.
   The proposed approach, however, is applicable only for single medium
   filters. Further research is warranted to extend it to dual and tri
   media filters.}},

   given facility, population distributions were examined from cores within
   a filter, from cores between different filters and from cores from the
   same filter during different seasons. There was remarkably little
   difference in distributions for a given facility. There were marked
   differences between facilities. Two of the plants that practice
   conventional cleaning techniques (Springfield, Mass. and New Haven,
   Conn.) showed typically high populations and biomass in the schmutzdecke
   and sharply declining populations and biomass with depth. Strong
   intercorrelations between acriflavine direct cell counts (AFDC),
   specific plate counts, biomass as Folin-reactive material (FRM) and
   extractable Fe and Mn were seen with depth in filter cores. The plant
   that practices wet harrowing as a cleaning technique (West Hartford,
   Conn.) showed schmutzdecke-like high populations and biomass down to the
   depth of harrowing (30 cm). The reduction of tetrazolium chloride as a
   measure of respiratory electron transport and the ability to mineralize
   {[}C-14]benzoate was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in West Hartford
   samples; up to 14\% of the schmutzdecke direct counts reduced
   tetrazolium and mineralization rates up to 35 ng/ml/h (rate constants of
   0.65 d-1) were observed. Removal of the < 0.5 k AMW fraction of the AOM
   was particularly pronounced at the West Hartford facility, corroborating
   the observed metabolism of benzoate and suggesting that smaller
   molecular weight AOM is supporting growth in the filters. Harrowing
   therefore maintains high levels of acclimated and metabolically active
   biomass in the slow sand filters.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the conversion of acetic acid into the weaker carbonic acid and
   methane, the pH inside methanogenic aggregates is higher than in the
   bulk liquid. The pH profiles in aggregates were measured with pH
   microelectrodes. These profiles strongly determine the macro-kinetics of
   the aggregate, by their influence on the values of the growth parameters
   K(s) and mu(max). Acetate transport resistances were not limiting for
   the conversion rate in methanogenic aggregates. Nevertheless, the
   effectiveness factor-eta did not approach unity, but amounted to
   0.57-0.62 in the acetate concentration range relevant for most
   methanogenic reactors. The value of eta is determined almost entirely by
   the pH profiles inside the aggregates. It was concluded that for the
   physical/mathematical description of the conversion in methanogenic
   aggregates, information on the pH gradients and the pH dependency of the
   growth parameters is indispensable.
   Batch experiments showed that acetate uptake by aggregates was not
   coupled directly to methanogenesis. Consumed acetate was not converted
   instantaneously to methane, suggesting the conversion to proceed via a
   pool of acetate or reserve material.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Experiments in batch soil/aqueous systems were conducted to evaluate the
   sorption onto soil of three micelle-forming non-ionic surfactants and
   one lamellae-forming non-ionic surfactant. Non-ionic surfactant sorption
   onto soil was assessed using a surface tension technique for
   aqueous-phase surfactant concentrations less than surfactant monomer
   saturation. These sorption data were found to fit a Freundlich isotherm.
   Non-ionic surfactant sorption onto soil was assessed in the presence of
   surfactant micelles, or surfactant bilayer lamellae, depending on the
   type of surfactant, with either a spectrophotometric technique or a
   chemical oxidation technique. Sorption of the micelle-forming non-ionic
   surfactants onto soil was found to be constant at a value of the bulk
   solution surfactant concentration exceeding surfactant monomer
   saturation, i.e. the critical micelle concentration. Sorption of the
   lamellae-forming non-ionic surfactant onto soil was found to be an
   increasing function of the surfactant dose for bulk solution surfactant
   concentrations exceeding a critical aggregate concentration.
   Understanding of surfactant sorption onto soil is needed to assess
   surfactant mobility in soil and surfactant-facilitated transport of
   organic compounds in soil/aqueous systems.}},

Title = {{THE EXPORT OF PARTICULATE MATTER, PARTICULATE PHOSPHORUS AND DISSOLVED
   PHOSPHORUS FROM 2 AGRICULTURAL RIVER BASINS - IMPLICATIONS ON ESTIMATING
   THE NONPOINT PHOSPHORUS LOAD}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The transport of particulate matter (PM), particulate phosphorus (PP)
   and dissolved phosphorus (DP) in two agricultural river basins was
   intensively measured during 1 year (October 1986-September 1987).
   Seasonal and stage-dependent rating relationships between the
   concentration of particulate inorganic (PIM) and organic matter (POM)
   and discharge were calculated for the Lyngbygaards river whereas only
   single rating relationships were established for the Aarhus river, in
   which a high proportion of the catchment area drains to lakes (48\%).
   The export coefficients for PIM were rather similar for the two
   catchments (228 and 271 kg ha-1 yr-1) when only including the part of
   the river basins actively involved in sediment delivery and in the range
   previously reported for lowland rivers in Canada and U.K.
   Significant relationships between PIM and POM and the associated
   phosphorus fractions were calculated. During low-flow periods the
   P-content of PIM were high (1.5 and 1.2\%) decreasing to 0.5\% during
   high flow. On the contrary, the P-content of POM was constantly around
   1\% except for a period in late summer in the Lyngbygaards river where
   the P-content decreased to 0.2-0.3\% during the first autumn storms
   following weed cutting. A very high P-enrichment in PM compared with
   average soil P-content was documented (7-14) indicating the selective
   delivery and routing of PM in lowland rivers.
   In both rivers the concentration of dissolved inorganic P (DIP) were
   inversely related to discharge demonstrating the dilution of P from
   point sources at increasing flow. However, in the Lyngbygaards river
   significantly higher concentration levels of DIP were recognized at
   periods of storm run-off possibly indicating the importance of DIP
   delivery with surface run-off and P-releases during resuspension of PM
   from the river bottom.
   The non-point P-load was nearly equally high (1.15 and 0.90 kg ha-1
   yr-1) in the two agricultural basins when omitting the part of the
   Aarhus river basin draining to the deep Stilling/Solbjerg lake which
   retains appreciable amounts of P. Equally high non-point P-loads are
   reported for agricultural basins in Finland and Norway whereas
   appreciable lower non-point P-loads are normally reported for
   agricultural areas in Sweden and Denmark.}},

Abstract = {{A general study of manganese and zinc in both dissolved and particulate
   forms in waters from the Seine river, its estuary and the Bay of Seine
   (in northern France) has been undertaken in order to investigate their
   fate and transport processes in riverine, estuarine and coastal
   environments. These samples have been analyzed using graphite-furnace
   atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS), inductively coupled
   plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and differential pulse
   anodic stripping voltammetry (DPASV). In this work, we have considered
   the different parameters (salinity, pH, temperature and total suspended
   matter) which may influence the metal distribution in the estuary, and
   have surveyed the evolution of these metals (with numerous soluble
   organic and inorganic ligands) in aqueous phases and their interaction
   with the various inorganic and organic solid fractions which compose the
   particles. The results show that dissolved Mn and Zn are mainly
   influenced by salinity. Furthermore, their variability is governed by
   temporal and spacial changes in tidal stress. Indeed, the distributions
   of dissolved Mn and Zn are linked to the internal properties of
   particles and the flow of sediments regulated by the tidally-induced
   perturbations in the estuary bed. Since the cause of these observations
   is in connection with the interactions between the liquid phase and the
   solids present, we have also undertaken the chemical speciation of Mn
   and Zn in the particles. The results obtained confirm the
   non-conservative behavior of these two metals. Owing to the paramagnetic
   properties of Mn, we have been able to analyze particles using electron
   spin resonance spectroscopy in order to gain further information about
   the nature of Mn compounds, their oxidation states and their
   combinations.}},

Abstract = {{Ten isolates of Acinetobacter spp, obtained from sewage and showing high
   activities of polyphosphate: AMP phosphotransferase {[}ranging from 10
   to 57 nmol min-1 (mg protein-1)] were studied for their differences in
   polyphosphate accumulation. Using electron microscopy, differences in
   numbers and sizes of the stored granules for the different strains were
   observed. These granules could be unambiguously identified as
   polyphosphate granules by electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI). Size and
   numbers of these granules found in different strains correlated with the
   intensity of different bands obtained from fractionated polyphosphates
   by polyacrylamide gel-electrophoresis (PAGE). Two different fractions,
   both consisting of high molecular weight polyphosphates (equivalent
   chain length), were obtained. Their distribution was strain specific. By
   electron microscopy and the ESI technique it could be further shown that
   all strains produced extracellular polymers (ECP). For one strain, a
   considerable phosphate adsorption at these ECP was observed. These data
   indicate that even in pure culture studies, phosphate adsorption must be
   considered in addition to the phosphate metabolism of specialized
   organisms for a sufficient explanation of the excess ``biological{''}
   phosphate removal. For the much more complex situation in sewage
   treatment plants it is indispensable to consider various biological and
   chemical mechanisms for a sufficient explanation of ``biological
   phosphate removal{''}.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of fluidized bed reactor systems with (1) adsorptive
   removal capacity only using granular activated carbon (GAC) without
   microbial growth, (2) combined biological and adsorptive removal
   mechanisms using GAC with microbial growth and (3) biological removal
   only using non-activated carbon with microbial growth was performed.
   These three systems were fed groundwater contaminated with benzene,
   toluene and xylene (BTX). The breakthrough profiles, steady-state
   removal of BTX and system responses to step increases in applied organic
   loading rates were investigated. During start-up, even though the same
   amount of inoculum was added to the two biological systems, the time
   required until effective biodegradation commenced in the system
   employing GAC as a biomass carrier was less than that observed for the
   system using non-activated carbon (200 vs 500 h). Significantly less BTX
   was released during this period by the system with combined removal
   mechanisms and the development of a contiguous biofilm was more rapid.
   Under constant, steady state, organic loading conditions (3 and 6
   kg-COD/m3-day), BTX removals were similar for the two biological
   systems, although the system employing the GAC carrier had lower
   effluent concentrations at the lower loading rate. More than 90\% of the
   BTX were removed in both systems. During step increases in organic
   loading, however, the combination of biological and adsorptive removal
   capacity resulted in enhanced BTX removal and more stable operation.
   Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine the extent of surface
   coverage of the GAC and non-activated carbon by the biofilm. Particles
   from both systems were observed to be completely covered by a
   contiguous, thick biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{It is usual to design and evaluate the performance of field waste
   stabilization ponds (WSPs) by using physical models. However, the actual
   performance of field ponds often deviates from that dictated by the
   corresponding physical models, This paper attributes this deviation,
   among other factors, to differences in environmental operating
   conditions, pond geometry and flow conditions. Thus, it has been
   suggested that results from physical models be modified by scale-up
   factors and factors of safety to account for the above differences
   before transferring them to full waste stabilization ponds. It might
   also be helpful to ensure that hydraulic similarity exists between the
   model and the prototype.}},

   After thawing the samples are centrifuged and dispensed into the wells
   of an immunological plate. The immunological plates, and their contents,
   are sterilized with u.v. light followed by inoculation with Chlorella
   kessleri. A simple unit with capacity for 250 samples (25 plates and 6
   replicates per sample) is used for cultivation. Yields are evaluated in
   situ, in a special plate reader, by nephelometry (absorbency measured at
   750 mm). The procedure may also be used for testing toxicity, the
   assessment of algal growth characteristics and investigation of some
   biochemical features.}},

Abstract = {{The aerobic biological treatability of a high strength olive oil-bearing
   wastewater was investigated. Two sets of experiments were carried out at
   17 and 25-degrees-C. The experimental observations have shown that
   effective BOD5 and oil removals could be realized using a
   completely-mixed activated process with recycle. Kinetic coefficients,
   oxygen utilization rates and other relevant parameters are determined to
   serve as a basis of design of such systems. The solids retention time
   (SRT) was considered as the major process control parameter. The effect
   of SRT on the kinetic coefficients and oxygen utilization rates are
   discussed in view of the experimental observations.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen removal by a single-stage, single-sludge activated sludge
   process with cross-flow filtration was qualitatively studied. Artificial
   wastewater had a BOD/TKN ratio from 1.8 to 24.5. The BOD loading to the
   process ranged from 0.33 to 1.66 g l-1 d-1, the TKN loading from 0.032
   to 0.268 g l-1 d-1 and the sludge retention time (SRT) was quite long
   (54-4200 d). In each experiment, more than 97\% of organic carbon was
   removed. The sludge biomass concentration (MLVSS) was high at a high
   volumetric BOD loading. Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) was successfully
   nitrified and higher than 29\% of the TKN which was loaded to the
   reactor was removed in many of the experimental runs. The nitrogen
   balance of each unit was calculated. Denitrification was estimated to be
   responsible for 39-86\% of the removed nitrogen in an aeration vessel.
   Although denitrification was not observed up to 0.438 g l-1 d-1 of BOD
   loading, the denitrification rate increased as the BOD loading
   increased. The percentage of nitrogen removal was a function of the
   BOD/TKN ratio of the influent. Lower DO concentration did not increase
   the denitrification rate, but intermittent aeration-BOD loading did
   increase it; TKN was completely removed up to 0.21 TKN g l-1 d-1, and
   the denitrification rate reached 0.0074 gN VSS-1 d-1.}},

Abstract = {{Organotin compounds belong to the widespread micropollutants in the
   aquatic environment. They can be analysed by different analytical
   procedures. The recently available atomic emission detector (AED) in
   combination with gas chromatography is a promising tool for this task.
   Identification and quantification of organotin compounds in water and
   sediment can be achieved in ranges of ng/l and mu-g/l, respectively. The
   quality criteria for the values obtained depend strongly on the matrices
   and on the tin-species investigated. In general recovery rates are
   higher for aqueous samples than for sediments. From model experiments it
   can be deduced that humic substances play an important role in
   adsorption of tin organyles in sediment. In addition to the known fact
   that activated carbon readily eliminates tributyltin from aqueous
   solutions, the kinetics of recovery experiments show that part of the
   organotin compounds are irreversibly adsorbed on solid phase.}},

Abstract = {{A model describing the growth of bacteria and the degradation of methane
   and trichloroethylene (TCE) based on the concept of competitive
   inhibition is proposed. The model has been applied to laboratory batch
   experiments representing different initial TCE concentrations
   (50-4300-mu-g/l) and initial methane concentrations (0.53-3.2 mg/). The
   proposed model simulated successfully the data obtained for initial
   methane concentration (less than 1.8 mg/), causing constant experimental
   growth conditions during the experiments. This indicates that the
   interactions between methane and TCE degradation can be explained as
   competitive inhibition. The model simulations of the results from the
   experiments with the highest initial methane concentration of 3.2 mg/l
   failed, supposedly because the growth conditions changed during the
   experiments.
   The proposed model is a useful engineering tool for design of treatment
   processes and in situ bioremediation schemes for degradation of TCE by
   methane-oxidizing bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Algal assays, using the marine diatom Nitzschia closterium, have
   established that humic acid (5 mg kg-1) can ameliorate the toxicity of
   the lipophilic complex Cu(oxine)2 (3 x 10(-8) mol l-1 in unsupplemented
   seawater). The toxicity of Cu(PAN)2 is not ameliorated {[}PAN =
   1-(2-pyridylazo)-2-napthol]. In conjunction with previous visible
   absorption spectrophotometry and polarographic measurements it was
   established that humic acid sequesters copper(II) from the hydrophobic
   complexes, releasing a ligand molecule. The copper(II) toxicity may be
   ameliorated provided the ligand itself is not toxic.
   Fulvic acid was significantly less effective in ameliorating toxicity.
   Because of the significant competition from Ca(II) and Mg(II) in
   seawater, it is inferred that humic substances may be more effective in
   ameliorating toxicity of hydrophobic copper complexes in fresh water.}},

Abstract = {{Enzymatic liberation of molybdate reactive phosphorus (MRP) (equivalent
   to orthophosphate) from sediment extracts, obtained from sediments
   sampled from different parts of a subwatershed of Lake Leman, was
   investigated. Several hydrolytic enzymes; alkaline phosphatase,
   phosphodiesterase, RNase. DNase and phytase were used alone or in
   combination. As expected the release of MRP by combination of alkaline
   phosphatase with the other enzymes was more efficient than by alkaline
   phosphatase alone. in all cases, MRP enzymatically released accounted
   for less than 4\% of the total phosphorus in the sediment but
   represented between 5 and 23\% of the organic phosphorus. The highest
   percentage was obtained with the sediments polluted by domestic sewage.
   Traces of MRP were liberated by phytase only with the sediment of forest
   and agricultural origin. Phosphomonoesters were detected in each
   sediment as well as nucleic acids (except in the natural sediment). This
   study has shown that it seems possible to characterize organic
   phosphorus of sediments using this procedure.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis of long-term historical records of the concentrations of
   major ions, TDS and nutrients for 20 river sites in Latvia is reported.
   Periods of water quality observations ranged from 15 to 43 years. A
   study of the quarterly adjusted time series showed that characteristic
   features of the data are non-normal distributions, seasonality, serial
   correlation and presence of significant trends that are mostly positive.
   The application of state-of-the-art software, based on non-parametric
   statistics such as the Seasonal Kendall slope estimator and the Seasonal
   Hodges-Lehmann estimator, made it possible to investigate these water
   quality records more accurately than other methods allow.
   Typical seasonal variations and concentration-discharge relationships
   were analyzed for different constituents. It was shown that fertilizer
   application and marsh land reclamation can cause widespread and
   intensive river water quality changes. Concentration increases of as
   much as 5-10 times that of background values were detected for NO3-,
   Cl-, Na+ + K+ and SO42-. The main water quality changes took place in
   the 1960s and the early 1970s when fertilizer applications and
   reclamation works increased. After that, concentration increases for
   constituents other than NO3- and SO42- were statistically insignficiant.
   The significant increases for NO3- and SO42- were probably due to the
   additional impact of increased atmospheric deposition. The results of
   long-term changes of river loads entering the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of
   Rip from Latvian territory are examined.}},

Abstract = {{Ozonation and biological treatment were investigated as a means of
   controlling the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) as measured
   by total organic halides (TOX) and purgeable organic halides (POX).
   Organic matter from a groundwater and a river water source were used and
   chlorine or chloramines were used as the final disinfectant. The amount
   formed, the formation kinetics and the impact of disinfectant dose were
   investigated. Chloramination produced significantly less organic
   halides, especially POX, compared to chlorination. With both
   disinfectants and for both sources of organic matter, the nonpurgeable
   organic halide formation rate was found to be much faster than that of
   POX. Preozonation decreased the amount of organic halide formation by
   10-40\% upon subsequent chlorination. With chloramines preozonation had
   no significant impact on the extent of the reaction. Preozonation
   followed by biotreatment resulted in the least amount of organic halide
   formation with a reduction of 50-80\% when chlorine was used, and
   greater than 90\% with chloramines. In all cases examined, the ratio of
   organic halides to dissolved organic carbon decreased after biological
   treatment indicating a selectivity for the potential reactive sites.
   Based on the results of this bench scale study, pilot studies of

Abstract = {{A bench scale study was undertaken to examine the effects of exogenous
   carbon substrates on the removal of inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus by
   a simple nitrification denitrification process. Each plastic tank
   reactor was subjected to a 7-h aeration followed by a 5-h anoxic stage.
   Methanol, glucose and sodium acetate, at the concentrations equivalent
   to theoretical COD values of 100 and 200 mg O2 l-1 were used as external
   carbon sources and were added to the reactors prior to the anoxic stage.
   Effects of these additions on biological phosphate release were also
   investigated. The results showed that 94\% of NH4+-N was removed at the
   end of the aeration period. During the anoxic stage, reduction of
   nitrate to nitrogen gas was recorded and the denitrification process was
   significantly enhanced by the addition of organic carbon substrates. At
   the end of the anoxic stage, over 90\% reduction was achieved in the
   tanks with exogenous carbon substrates while only 47\% of NO3--N was
   removed in the control reactors. Among the three substrates, sodium
   acetate was the most efficient and effective source, followed by
   methanol and glucose. Addition of sodium acetate not only increased the
   amount of nitrate reduction but also enhanced the rate of N removal
   especially when a high dosage of sodium acetate was used. With respect
   to phosphorus removal, 88\% ortho-P was removed after the aerobic stage.
   Throughout the anoxic stage, P concentration was maintained at about 2
   mg l-1 in both control and methanol treated reactors. However,
   significant increase in effluent P content was recorded in both sodium
   acetate and glucose treatments indicating that phosphorus was released
   from the bacterial cells during the anoxic stage. The amount of
   P-release in these two treatments was related to the concentrations of
   the carbon substrate used.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of reactive and total mercury (in the u.v.-irradiated
   samples) were measured in the Krka River Estuary during the period from
   April 1988 to February 1991. Salinity, temperature, pH(NBS), calcium and
   magnesium were also measured. Only calcium and magnesium ions exhibited
   a linear conservative dilution property. Temperature measurements
   indicated a subsurface warming just below the freshwater-seawater
   interface (FSI) in spring and temperature inversion in winter. pH(NBS)
   profiles showed different patterns with variations up to one pH unit.
   The concentrations of reactive and total mercury, exhibiting different
   patterns, present a ``momentum situation{''} and suggest composite
   scavenging processes.
   The fate of mercury in the Krka River Estuary is highlighted and
   qualitatively described as follows: -from increased surface mercury
   concentrations after a heavy rain, an atmospheric mercury input has been
   suggested -mercury species in the freshwater layer are chiefly connected
   with organic material -the adsorption of mercury at the FSI can occur on
   at least some of the mineral surfaces found at the FSI and identified in
   this work. (The identified phases are: calcite, quartz, calcium silicate
   hydrate and takanelite) -transport of mercury to sediments occurs,
   during calm weather, by sedimentation of particulates with the adsorbed
   mercury, and during a storm, by a wind-induced vertical gyre within the
   marine layer.
   The seawater at the bottom is replaced with the seawater from the FSI
   which accumulates organic material. Consequently, mercury is bound more
   to the organic material than to the inorganic complexes.
   The difference in total and reactive mercury concentrations observed in
   the whole vertical profile after the Bura wind, shows that mercury is
   bound to organic material on that occasion. This difference could be
   used as a useful parameter for observation of the vertical mixing in the
   seawater layer in the Krka River Estuary during a storm.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm for the automated control of an urban head-and-gravity flow
   sewage disposal system is proposed. The algorithm is based on a
   mathematical model and presupposes the use of a computer. The
   mathematical model is written as algebraic equations and equation
   restrictions take into account the structure's transporting capacities.
   The mathematical task of control is stated and solved as an optimization
   problem. The assumptions substantiated by practice would reduce the
   problem to the known problem of linear programming. The purpose of this
   exercise is to find the minimum total energy consumption by all pumping
   stations of the sewerage network. The control system structure is
   discussed. Possibilities of the proposed method for employment in the
   control of a sewerage network are analysed both under normal and
   emergency conditions. The data from experimental checks of the algorithm
   in the sewage disposal system of Moscow are given.}},

Abstract = {{The FDA hydrolysis capacities and bacterial biomass concentrations
   (estimated by determination of ATP content) of growth cultures prepared
   from activated sludge and wastewater, were measured to find out whether
   the FDA activity would reflect bacterial biomass under different
   physiological states of the bacteria. The FDA activity/ATP ratio was
   calculated for different concentrations of autoclaved sludge. A faster
   decay rate of ATP relative to FDA hydrolysis activity was observed, thus
   causing changes in the ratio, Furthermore, comparison between values
   obtained from pure cultures and different soils revealed differences up
   to two orders of magnitude of the ratio. Based on these results it was
   concluded that the FDA activity should not be applied for measurements
   of viable biomass in environments in which different physiological
   conditions occur.}},

   TOXICITIES OF SURFACTANTS TO FRESH-WATER AND MARINE LIFE}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The effects of several environmental modifying factors on surfactant
   toxicity have been reported in the scientific literature during the past
   40 years.  The results from 58 reports describing, among other factors,
   the effects of mixtures, hardness and temperature are summarized in this
   report.  The most common test compound used in the reviewed studies was
   the anionic linear alkylbenzene sulfonate.  Most tests have been
   conducted in the laboratory with single species of freshwater fish, but
   a few studies have been conducted in ponds, lakes and rivers with
   natural biotic assemblages.  Of the 58 reports reviewed, those
   describing the toxicities of mixtures containing surfactants are the
   most numerous (n = 32).  The impact of the presence of pesticides and
   metals on surfactant toxicity has been unpredictable but oil-surfactant
   mixtures are usually more toxic than expected.  Increasing water
   hardness and temperature increases surfactant toxicity in some cases but
   the outcome has been compound and species-specific.  The presence of
   suspended solids and naturally occurring dissolved substances decreases
   the bioavailability of cationic surfactants but not that of anionic and
   nonionic surfactants.  The impact of other chemical and physical
   modifying factors on surfactant toxicity are too poorly understood to
   generalize.  Therefore, additional research is needed to determine these
   effects particularly on the chronic toxicities of surfactants at the
   multispecies level.  These data are necessary if environmental hazard
   assessments for most surfactants are to go beyond their current
   simplification and be more effective in predicting ecological risk.}},

Abstract = {{The most important motive for direct anaerobic treatment of municipal
   wastewater is the low sludge production.  Indeed, treatment and disposal
   of sewage sludge is technically cumbersome and economically a heavy
   burden.
   Provided wastewater temperatures are a minimum of 10-15-degrees-C, the
   influent organics are higher than 500 mg/l and contain soluble
   high-energy COD, and provided levels of sulfate and suspended solids are
   low, direct anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater can be performed
   satisfactorily.  Yet, direct anaerobic treatment of municipal wastewater
   can only be considered as a pretreatment since sulfide is formed and
   nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphate, are hardly removed.  The high
   substrate threshold of methane-producing bacteria will always render
   direct anaerobic treatment of low strength wastewater less performing. 
   It is argued that initial removal and digestion of the particulate
   organics, in combination with treatment of the soluble organics by means
   of a trickling filter with thick biofilm, might constitute an optimal
   way of maximizing anaerobic electron flux, resulting in an overall lower
   final sludge production and yet still achieving a high quality, low
   nutrient effluent.}},

Abstract = {{Factors which contributed to the death of 5000 fish, comprising 18
   species, and accompanying water quality changes in Donkey Camp Pool, a
   part of the Katherine River system in the Australian wet/dry tropics,
   are discussed.  The water quality of the pool was modified by the first
   run-off of the 1987-1988 wet season.  A similar run-off event 9 days
   later caused significant water quality changes.  Colour, turbidity, iron
   and manganese were at least an order of magnitude greater and coliform
   concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than typical dry
   season values.  Furthermore, the pool was stratified with low surface
   dissolved oxygen concentrations and anoxic conditions at depth.  These
   conditions remained until the pool was completely flushed by a large
   run-off event 11 days later.  The fish kill was primarily related to
   natural causes associated with low dissolved oxygen concentrations.  The
   pool water was displaced with cool run-off from a tributary of the
   Katherine River which carried a substantial organic load and had a high
   oxygen demand.  It is concluded that the low dissolved oxygen
   concentrations were the major cause of the fish kill with possible
   additional harmful effects from toxic humic compounds.  The event
   highlights the significant impact storm run-off can have on the quality
   of receiving waters in the Australian wet/dry tropics.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology has been developed for predicting volatile organic
   concentration levels immediately downwind of wastewater treatment
   facilities, as well as further away, under neutral or stable atmospheric
   conditions. For the case of a ground-level well-mixed continuous-flow
   basin with intense mechanical aeration at the surface, the rates of mass
   transfer of organic pollutants to the atmosphere are obtained by
   assuming that the entire resistance to mass transfer resides in the
   stagnant film at the liquid phase interface. The atmospheric transport
   of the organic emissions downwind are then predicted by a
   three-dimensional atmospheric dispersion equation, considering dry
   deposition as a sink mechanism and accounting for variations of wind
   velocity and vertical diffusivity with height above the ground. The
   variation of downward concentration levels with Henry's constant is
   examined for different atmospheric stabilities, deposition velocities,
   surface roughnesses and basin surface areas.}},

Abstract = {{Among the alternative oxidants or disinfectants which can be used in
   drinking water processes to reduce or to prevent the formation of
   organohalogenated by-products, chlorine dioxide (ClO2) is one of the
   most efficient. Chlorine dioxide itself generates negligible production
   of trihalomethanes compared to chlorine. However, chlorine dioxide
   produces chloride and chlorite ions and small amounts of chlorate ions
   as inorganic by-products. As chlorite and chlorate are suspected to have
   toxic effects, health authorities recommend a maximum concentration of
   chlorine dioxide, chlorite and chlorate of 1.0 mg l-1 or less in
   drinking waters. Therefore, the reagents and concentrations of
   by-products have to be controlled or reduced. Several studies have shown
   that activated carbon can remove chlorite ions at interesting capacities
   for practical applications and that the reaction between chlorite and
   activated carbon leads to chloride as the predominant by-product and to
   chlorate (Table 1). Moreover, some workers have shown that the presence
   of activated carbon can initiate degradation reactions of organic
   compounds by chlorite. The aim of this study is to better understand the
   reactions between chlorite or chlorine dioxide and activated carbon.}},

   Isotherms and the dependence of adsorption on time for Cd, Ni and

   minerals (as suspended matter) were exposed to trace metals and phenolic
   compound solutions.  It was found that chlorite was a better adsorbent

   investigation of the interactive effects of these pollutants on the
   sorption phenomena was studied.  Cadmium would compete with nickel for
   the same adsorption sites.  Vanillic acid was less sorbed than eugenol,

Abstract = {{The general purpose of this study is to try to identify the organic
   compounds that react with chlorine from the Seine water entering the
   final treatment stage at the Choisy-le-Roi potable waterworks, near
   Paris.  We present here the part of the study concerning the chlorine
   consumption kinetics of samples of water taken after overall treatment. 
   The influence of TOC, water, pH and temperature were initially examined.
   The Choisy-le-Roi plant (Fig. 1) supplies 2 million inhabitants living
   in the southern suburbs of Paris.  The drinking water process is based
   on biological treatment and chlorine is injected at the end of the run. 
   Samples of water were taken after GAC filtration when the ammonia
   concentration was less than 30-mu-g l-1.
   All operations were carried out in vessels carefully cleaned
   (sulfochromic mixture, milliQ water) and stored in chlorine solution
   (100 mg l-1 Cl2), then rinsed with milliQ water just before use.  Seine
   fulvic acid was extracted following the method of Thurman and Malcolm
   (1981).  Bovine serum albumin was supplied by Fluka.  Chlorinations were
   carried out in a batch system at 20-degrees-C in darkness, by adding
   micro-volumes of chlorine stock solution.  For each run, a blank was
   performed at the same pH as the water being chlorinated.  The chlorine
   consumptions by the blanks were subtracted from the chlorine
   consumptions observed for the water samples.  Total residual chlorine
   and free residual chlorine were analyzed by the DPD colorimetric method
   (Afnor, 1987) with minor modifications.  Total organic carbon analysis
   was performed with a Dohrman DC 80 apparatus.  Ultrafiltration was
   carried out with a 400 ml Amicon cell and YM 30, YM 10, YM 2 and YV 05
   membranes, under 3 bar-pressure with nitrogen purified by passing
   through a silica gel cartridge, a granular activated carbon cartridge
   then a 750-degrees-C furnace.
   The chlorine demand (total chlorine) of the GAC filtered waters is
   presented in Figs 2 and 3 for the 1987 period.  The formation of
   combined chlorine built up quickly then remained constant at a value of
   under 0.2 mg l-1 Cl2.  We decided to consider the results by dividing
   the chlorine demand into two phases (Fig. 4):
   -an initial phase of immediate consumption during the first 4 h, called
   the initial chlorine demand (ID) -a second slow consumption phase after
   the first 4 h, called the long term chlorine demand (LTD).  The LTD has
   been interpreted with the following kinetic law (Jadas-Hecart, 1989)
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   where b (unknown value) = the content in precursors of LTD or, again,
   the potential or LTD after 4 h a = the total residual chlorine at 4 h x
   = chlorine consumption after 4 h n = stoichiometry k = the rate constant
   alpha, beta = partial orders of reaction.  Assuming n = 1, the kinetics
   were found to be consistent with an overall second-order rate law (alpha
   = beta = 1).  The b value could be evaluated from the ultimate chlorine
   consumption of the experimental data (computer calculator leading to the
   best correlation).  Table 1 gives values of k, b and ID for 1987 and
   1989.  Table 2 presents the mean values where b/TOC does not seem to be
   a function of sampling period (1987: 1.2 mg Cl2/mg TOC; 1989: 1.4 mg
   Cl2/mg TOC).  However the seasonal evolution of b and TOC was found to
   be difficult to correlate in spite of some analogies (Fig. 5).
   As for the effect of pH (Table 5), dissociation of hypochlorous acid is
   probably the main factor responsible for the evolution of the apparent
   rate constant in the pH field studied (k decreases as pH increases
   between 7.5 and 8.5).  However, this effect is slight.  An increasing
   temperature, between 5 and 30-degrees-C, leads to an increasing apparent
   rate constant (Table 6) as in the case of reactions with simple
   compounds.  Note that long-term chlorine demand (b) also increases.
   Several studies about the chlorine demand of the organic material of GAC
   filtered water, after ultrafiltration, showed that the apparent
   molecular weight fraction lower than 1 kDa represents an important part
   of the total demand (ID + b), nearly 60\% of that of GAC filtered water
   (Fig. 6 and Table 7).
   There are several applications for this kinetic model.  The first comes
   directly from the mathematical expressions of the apparent rate constant
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   and of the long term chlorine demand
   {[}GRAPHICS]
   From these expressions, and from the knowledge of the kinetic parameters
   (k(i) and b(i)) giving the chlorine consumption of complex compounds, it
   is possible to determine for a solution of these compounds, the part
   played by each one in the chlorine consumption observed in the mixture. 
   We have shown that it was possible to determine the kinetic parameters
   of the solution of fulvic acid (extracted from the Seine river) and
   bovine serum albumin, on the grounds of results obtained for each of
   them (Table 4).  Let us note that for these two compounds the total
   demand of chlorine (ID + b) is very different, as it is 1.4 mg Cl2/mg
   TOC for the Seine fulvic acid, while it is 6 mg Cl2/mg TOC for protein.
   The second application is more practical as it is possible to use the
   kinetic parameters of water as an analytical measure to optimize the
   different steps of the drinking water treatment.  In this way, it has
   been shown that the treatment coupling ozonation and GAC filtration
   significantly reduces the total chlorine demand of the water (cf. Tables
   1 and 8).  This is particularly observed during summer, showing the
   importance played by biological activities in activated carbon as shown
   by Bablon et al. (1987).  Finally, the knowledge of the kinetic data of
   GAC filtered water allows the part played by water in the disappearance
   of chlorine in networks to be calculated.  Indeed, chlorine stability in
   distributed water (under real conditions of chlorination and
   dechlorination applied in the plant) can be predicted by a simplified
   kinetic law of pseudo-first-order (Figs 7 and 8).  Let us note that this
   equation does not describe the real disappearance of chlorine in
   networks but rather the part played by organic matter in water.  The
   part due to the network itself (biofilm, material ...) is still to be
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption of chlorophenols by anaerobic sludge granules was studied
   in order to more completely understand the fate of chlorophenols and
   their degradation products in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors.
   Sorption isotherms were determined for pentachlorophenol and most
   isomers of tri-, di- and monochlorophenols, and the data were fitted to
   the Freundlich equation. Sorption by the sludge granules was
   considerable. Most, but not all, chlorophenols had linear sorption
   isotherms, which were defined by simple distribution coefficients. Those
   distribution coefficients were only weakly correlated to octanol-water
   partition coefficients, and there were no obvious relationships between
   sorption and numbers or positions of chlorine substituents. Sorption of
   two chlorophenols was highly reversible, but it was not for a third
   chlorophenol tested. Pentachlorophenol was more strongly sorbed than the
   lesser-chlorinated phenols, and pentachlorophenol sorption by sludge
   granules was weaker than its previously reported sorption by other
   biological materials. The Freundlich model, with empirically determined
   constants from this study, described the partitioning behaviour of
   chlorophenols in anaerobic sludge blanket reactors reasonably well.}},

   purification plant of La Velles (Salamanca, Spain).  In situ, the
   efficacy of the purification system, when the lagoons of the plant were
   partially aerated, rose from 92, 91, 95 and 17\% in the die-off of total
   coliforms, fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci and sulfite-reducing
   clostridia to 99, 99, 97 and 53\%, respectively.  In order to study the
   effects of the microbial load on the die-off of fecal coliform bacteria
   and fecal streptococci, in vitro experiments were conducted.  The
   results show that the reduction in the bacterial flora of the wastewater
   due to different treatments involved a proportional reduction in the

Abstract = {{The effects of the dissolved oxygen concentration on biological
   nitrification in suspended biomass processes are investigated.  A model
   of nitrification, in which the kinetics is expressed by considering both
   the intrinsic rate of ammonia oxidation and the diffusion rate of
   substrates inside the biological floc, is presented.  The model is
   calibrated and validated utilizing experimental data of tests performed
   in conditions of oxygen limiting kinetics.  Excellent agreement is found
   between experimental results and model predictions.  Finally, the model
   is applied to evaluate the effectiveness factor, eta, i.e. the ratio
   between the actual substrate removal rate and the intrinsic rate, as a
   function of the biofloc's diameter at different levels of dissolved
   oxygen concentration.  The results obtained show that in nitrification
   processes, the effects related to oxygen internal diffusion resistances
   cannot be neglected in evaluating the overall kinetics.  A marked
   decrease in the eta value is found at a biofloc diameter greater than
   100-mu-m, particularly when the dissolved oxygen concentration is

Abstract = {{An empirical model for the disappearance of chlorine-induced combined
   oxidant in estuarine water was developed.  The initial concentrations
   and composition of combined oxidant followed the hump and dip type of
   break-point curve after 1 h.  The disappearance of combined oxidant
   could be approximated by a first-order reaction.  However, the
   decomposition pathway of combined oxidant below the weight ratio of
   chlorine dose to ammonia nitrogen required for the maximum amount of
   combined oxidant in the break-point curve (r(p)) was clearly different
   from that above r(p).  Below r(p) the decrease in combined oxidant was
   mainly due to the reaction of monochloramine with bromide in estuarine
   water.  The observed rate constants increased slightly with increase in
   the weight ratio of chlorine dose to ammonia nitrogen (C(N)/C0) and/or
   the concentrations of bromide.  Above r(p) the decomposition rate of
   combined oxidant was presumably determined by the composition of
   combined oxidant after 1 h, i.e. the proportions of monochloramine,
   bromochloramine and dibromamine.  The observed rate constants depended
   primarily on the value of C(N)/C0, regardless of the bromide
   concentration.  Using our proposed model, the maximum persistence of
   combined oxidant formed in estuarine water could be estimated.}},

Abstract = {{The agar plate method is still the method of choice for quantifying
   viable bacteria in water, especially in routine laboratories. Eleven
   nutrient agar media were compared for colony forming ability by
   incubating at 25 and at 30-degrees-C. Appearance of colonies was
   recorded against time and colony forming curves were constructed. The
   highest counts after 5 days (c. 75\% of maximum count) were obtained on
   R3A agar incubation at 30-degrees-C. R3A agar at 30-degrees-C also
   allowed the most rapid colony development, with most of the colonies
   appearing between 2 and 5 days. Both plate count agar (PCA) and standard
   I Agar (Std I) performed poorly. PCA yielded 30\% of the highest count
   after 5 days at 30 and at 25-degrees-C. Std I yielded 27\% at
   30-degrees-C and 23\% at 25-degrees-C. The standard procedure of 48 h at
   30-degrees-C on PCA yielded 14\% of the final highest count, i.e. one
   log less.
   In contrast to PCA and StdI, R3A agar contained magnesium and pyruvate,
   both of which were shown to increase the plate count. R3A also had a
   lower nitrogen content and nitrogen to carbon ratio. The highest count
   after 14 days was achieved on double strength R3A (R4A) at 20-degrees-C.
   R4A also showed the highest colony diversity. It was therefore seen to
   be the most suitable for population studies. However, colony development
   was slower. This makes it unsuitable for plate counts, whereas R3A lets
   most cells develop into colonies within the first 5 days of incubation.}},

Abstract = {{The cell retention capacities of three porous microcarriers with
   diversified pore characteristics and Ottawa silica sand were studied in
   methanogenic fluidized bed reactors with acetic acid as the sole
   substrate.  Batch kinetic experiments on substrate utilization at
   different initial bulk-liquid substrate concentrations were also
   performed.
   The experimental data reveal that, under similar startup conditions,
   porous microcarriers are capable of reducing the startup times by more
   than 50\% as compared to sand.  Furthermore, under pseudo-steady-state
   conditions at an organic loading of 6 g total organic carbon
   (TOC)/1-day, porous microcarriers are capable of retaining three times
   more immobilized cells as compared to sand.  More than 90\% of total
   reactor cell mass is immobilized on porous microcarriers as opposed to
   80\% on sand.  As a result, porous microcarriers are conducive for
   better proliferation of slow-growing methanogenic bacterial consortia. 
   The experimental data clearly indicate that surface area, total pore
   volume and mean pore diameter should be used concomitantly to obtain
   better insight into the cell retention capacity of a given porous
   microcarrier.
   Batch kinetic data on substrate utilization reveal that mass transfer
   limitations are absent in methanogenic fluidized bed reactors at
   bulk-liquid TOC concentrations > 10 mg/l.  The observed maximum
   substrate utilization rates, which are independent of initial
   bulk-liquid TOC concentrations ranging from 200 to 1000 mg/l, are low
   for porous microcarriers as compared to sand (0.5 vs 2.25 day-1).  These
   data confirm the results of the microscopic examinations performed which
   indicate that porous microcarriers attract Methanothrix type bacterial
   consortia whereas Ottawa silica sand attracts a mixture of Methanothrix
   and Methanosarcina.}},

   Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7, was isolated from patients' feces in
   tests conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. Illness was
   restricted to people using public water supply. Untreated groundwater
   quality was not a factor but some disturbances in the distribution
   system, possibly 43 water meter replacements and 2 line breaks, may have
   allowed contaminants to enter the water supply. This is the first time a

Abstract = {{This study focuses on uranium sorption mechanisms by Mucor miehei, a
   fungal biomass, used in agro-industries (enzyme synthesis).  The pH
   plays an important part in these phenomena, mainly by its influence on
   metal or cell wall chemistry.  Hydroxylation of uranyl, dependent on the
   pH and total metal concentration, influences kinetics, via the nature of
   the limiting phases:  diffusion of metal through layers bordering or
   constituting the biomass, or intramembranar precipitation of uranyl
   initially adsorbed, and sorption mechanisms.  With a moderate pH,
   sorption of uranylhydroxides modifies extracellular sorbent structures,
   consequently inducing a multilayer sorption opposed to monolayer
   adsorption obtained with acid pH.  Uptake capacity is characterized by
   high values obtained even with low metal concentration in solution. 
   Biosorbent could be a technical answer to pollution treatment and
   valorization of low charge waste streams and leaching solutions obtained
   in recovery of infra-marginal ores.}},

Abstract = {{Five types of simulated dye wastewater, separately prepared with
   disperse, reactive, direct, acid and basic dyes, were decolorized with a
   hydrogen peroxide-ferrous ion system, known as Fenton's reagent. The
   results are that the best pH value for decolorization is below 3.5, the
   average percent removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) is about 90\%,
   the transparency of wastewater is above 25 cm and the average percent
   decolorization is above 97\%. All the results of treating the dye
   wastewater of actual dyeing and finishing mills are similar to those in
   the laboratory. Temperature mainly influences the speed of
   decolorization, i.e. the lower the temperature, the longer the time for
   decolorization.}},

Abstract = {{Natural purification in a small wetland (474 m2) for linear
   alkylbenzenesulfonates (LAS) was assessed quantitatively and was found
   to involve adsorption on sediment particles and degradation with
   bacteria in the wetland. Temperature affected the amount of
   biodegradation but not adsorption. Consequently, biodegradation did not
   occur and LAS was decreased only by adsorption in winter in the present
   wetland. In the summer, decrease by biodegradation was larger than that
   of LAS in the inflow, and thus, LAS already adsorbed was also decreased.
   Natural purification is discussed from the standpoint of the carrying
   capacity of adsorption or biodegradation calculated from field data. It
   was concluded that the wetland could adsorb about 5 kg of LAS and could
   remove more than 20 kg of the chemical in a year while about 35 kg of
   LAS inflowed in a year.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation of levels of chlorinated hydrocarbons in rainwater,
   wastewater, surface microlayer and water column in the Rijeka Bay,
   Yugoslavia was performed. Samples were collected between 1976 and 1987
   at several stations located in the Rijeka Bay.
   Concentrations of chlorinated insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls
   in rainwater ranged from 0.69 to 2.43 for DDTs and from 1.3 to 12.2 ng
   dm-3 for PCBs. Concentrations were much higher in wastewater samples.
   The values ranged from 0.07 to 104.9 for DDTs and from 0.2 to 17.0 ng
   dm-3 for PCBs in coastal seawater samples, and from 0.05 to 0.57 ng dm-3
   for DDTs and under 0.2-1.7 for PCBs in open seawater samples.
   Concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons were higher in the surface
   microlayer with ranges from 3.0 to 25.3 ng dm-3 for DDTs and from 28.0
   to 597 ng dm-3 for PCBs in coastal seawater samples, and from 0.75 to
   4.2 ng dm-3 for DDTs, and under 1.0-52 ng dm-3 for PCBs for open
   seawater samples.
   From the results of this investigation of the fate of the measured
   pollutants in the Rijeka Bay aquatorium, it seems that PCB distribution
   in the coastal zone is slightly more influenced by sedimentation and
   evaporation from the microlayer, that is for DDT distribution.}},

   investigated at pH = 0 and pH = 4.7. Experiments are performed in both
   semi-batch and batch conditions by following the kinetic development of

   At pH = 0 first-order kinetics with respect to both ozone and Mn(II) are
   observed with no dependence upon the oxalic acid concentration. A rate
   constant of 6.2 x 10(4) 1 mol-1 min-1 and equimolar consumptions of
   ozone and oxalic acid are evaluated.
   At pH = 4.7 higher initial reactivities are observed whereas the low
   ozone to oxalic acid molar consumption ratios indicate the intervention
   of molecular oxygen in the oxidation process thus confirming its radical
   evolution.
   Reaction mechanisms are proposed to explain the observed reactive

Abstract = {{A strain of Alcaligenes denitrificans was isolated which had resistance
   to cadmium. The aerobic growth of the microbe in the presence of 10 or
   90 mg cadmium/1 resulted in removal of more than 95\% of the dissolved
   metal. The settled material contained up to 51\% cadmium. Much, if not
   all, of the cadmium occurred as cadmium carbonate as shown by the
   amounts of carbonate and cadmium, the stoichiometric ratio Cd/CO3 and
   the X-ray diffraction analysis. It is shown that A. denitrificans
   provoked the precipitation of cadmium carbonate in aerobiosis by making
   the solution alkaline in a protein-free culture.}},

Title = {{VALIDATION OF A PROTOCOL FOR KINETIC-STUDY OF VFA REMOVAL UNDER
   SIMULATED CONDITIONS OF LANDFILL LEACHATE TREATMENT ON ANAEROBIC FILTER}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{An original experimental procedure was developed to investigate the
   kinetics of VFA biodegradation under simulated conditions of landfill
   leachate treatment on a laboratory-scale anaerobic filter. The procedure
   was designed to maintain stable biological conditions in the reactor
   throughout the study in order to avoid interference due to microbial
   growth or decay. Six series of experiments were performed over a period
   of several months, and the rates of biodegradation of acetate,
   propionate and butyrate were determined. The purpose of this paper is to
   validate the procedure by statistical calculations of experimental data.
   Computation of the data showed that the variability of experimental
   results was only related to experimental and analytical errors and that
   no significant changes in biological conditions occurred over at least
   92 days. In addition, calculations of first-order kinetics showed that
   the determinations of the kinetic constants were very reproducible
   compared to analytical errors in VFA determinations. Finally,
   determinations of biomass concentrations by organic solids measurements
   confirmed that the experimental procedure allowed quasi steady and
   homogeneous biological conditions to be maintained in the experimental
   reactor over a period of 144 days.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The amount of precipitated metal phosphates and the acid-soluble
   polyphosphate concentration were measured in several sludges and pure
   cultures of Acinetobacter strains. The percentage of metal phosphates of
   the total phosphorus content of the sludges varied between negligible
   and about 80\%. Increasing ability to release phosphate anaerobically
   was frequently parallelled by a decreasing contribution of precipitated
   metal phosphates to the total phosphorus concentration in 10 different
   sludges. Sludges from fill and draw systems with over 100 mg P/g dry wt,
   were almost completely devoid of these precipitates. The same was true
   for polyphosphate-accumulating cultures of Acinetobacter. Besides high
   molecular weight polyphosphate, the sludges also contained low polymeric
   polyphosphates (LPP), ranging from 0 to 50\% of the total phosphate
   content. The LPP fraction in polyphosphate-accumulating cultures of
   Acinetobacter strains was between 3 and 23\% of their total phosphate
   content. Sludges developed in the fill and draw systems could release
   more than 50\% of the accumulated phosphate within 60 min. About 66\% of
   this phosphate originated from LPP. Pure cultures of Acinetobacter
   strains released less than 1 mg P/g dry wt in the same time. Reduction
   of phosphate release by an increase of the pH in the medium as a result
   of denitrification could only partly be explained by formation of
   precipitated phosphates.}},

Abstract = {{In the present technique for the measurement of the respiration rate,
   the DO-probe is repeatedly subjected to a step change of the oxygen
   concentration with a time interval of typically 20-30 s. The end value
   of each response is used to calculate the respiration rate of activated
   sludge. However, those end values can be inaccurate because of probe
   dynamics or probe response time. This paper describes an improved method
   to measure the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration with one and the same
   probe at the inlet and outlet of a respiration chamber. The real DO
   concentration at the end of each response can be estimated by fitting
   the DO measurements to a first-order response model of the probe.
   Furthermore, at each step response the time constant of the probe
   response can be estimated which provides a continuous diagnosis of the
   probe condition. The proposed method provides a reliable estimate of the
   real DO concentration and, as a result, the reliability of the
   calculated respiration rate is improved. The first-order probe response
   constant is a useful indicator for fouling of the probe membrane.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration of pretreated surface water with recharge wells is hampered
   by biological clogging processes in the aquifer, The influence of the
   concentration of easily assimilable organic carbon (AOC) in water on
   clogging was investigated in filter beds operated under well-defined
   laboratory conditions using acetate as a model substrate. Acetate
   concentrations in the water as low as 0.01 mg C/1 promoted clogging with
   the main head loss, caused by bacterial growth, in the first centimeter
   of the sand bed. An empirical model was developed describing a linear
   relationship between the operation period to reach a certain increase in
   head loss (T(Pi)) and the reciprocal value of the acetate concentration
   or acetate load {[}L(ac) g C/(m2 . d)] at a constant filtration rate.
   The rate of clogging, designated as the n-microbiological clogging
   factor (C(f)), is defined by the slope of the linear relationship
   between the square root of the increase of the head loss (P(i)1/2) and
   the operation time. This linear relationship demonstrated that the
   increase in clogging rate was constant with time.
   Observations at several locations with experimental recharge wells
   revealed that the AOC concentration is an important parameter for the
   biological clogging potential of water. The AOC concentration of water
   used for infiltration in a recharge well should be less than 0.01 mg
   acetate-C equiv/1 to prevent biological clogging for a period of more
   than a year.}},

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken to compare two enrichment broths and to test a
   new plate medium, Rambach agar, for their suitability to detect
   Salmonella from marine recreational waters. The study shows that under
   conditions of low levels of fecal contamination, Salmonella spp was
   isolated more efficiently using NR10(10)/43 broth. While at higher
   levels of fecal contamination NR10/43 broth effectively limits the
   growth of accompanying flora. For the highest level of fecal
   contamination Rambach apr was less selective than Hektoen enteric agar
   but Rambach agar was shown to be better than Hektoen apr for the
   recovery of Salmonella strains from low contaminated waters. On Rambach
   apr the distinct color of salmonellas, seen in red, enhanced correct
   identification. Biochemical and serological confirmation of Salmonella
   isolates was performed using the API Z System and Oxoid Salmonella Rapid
   Latext test. The combination of enrichment broths (24 h at
   42-degrees-C), isolation (24 h at 37-degrees-C) and identification
   systems described above (2 h or 1 min) allowed the detection of
   Salmonella from marine waters, with low or high levels of fecal
   contamination, in 48 h.}},

Abstract = {{Fecal coliform populations in aquatic bottom sediments have been cited
   as a more stable-index of overall water quality than corresponding
   populations in waters. This perceived stability is generally attributed
   to sediment environmental factors which purportedly augment fecal
   coliform persistence compared to waters. However, comparative population
   stabilities of fecal coliforms in sediments and waters have not been
   evaluated in reservoirs with tidal-like fluctuations. The population
   distributions of fecal coliforms were profiled in the waters and
   sediments of recreational beaches at two Arizona reservoirs to evaluate
   the stable-index hypothesis. Waters and sediments were collected every
   third day over a 50-day period from three depth zones, 0.3, 0.76 and 1.2
   m. Results show that both water and sediment fecal coliform populations
   were highly variable over time and that sediment populations were not
   more stable. Trends in fecal coliform populations in sediments could not
   be used to predict those in waters or vice versa. Factors believed to
   contribute to the high variability of sediment fecal coliforms included
   the coarse composition (> 90\% sand and gravel) of the beach sediments
   and fluctuations in reservoir pool elevations due to hydroelectric power
   operations.}},

   tubes, glass fiber and Nuclepore filters, cellulose dialysis membranes
   and fritted glass tubes. Exposure to most hardware materials did not
   significantly affect the concentration of four metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb)
   but there was significant loss (up to 79\%) of two organic compounds
   (fluoranthene, p,p'-DDE) to almost all the hardware materials tested. Of
   five commonly used IW collection methods (centrifuging, centrifugal
   drainage or basal cup, squeezing, vacuum filtration and dialysis)
   investigated, the centrifuge method was judged the most accurate and
   precise for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PCBs. All IW collection

Abstract = {{Oxidation kinetics of the reaction between NO and sulphites of sodium,
   potassium, ammonium and calcium were carried out in a stirred cell with
   a flat interface. The temperature was varied in the range of
   30-60-degrees-C. The NO partial pressure ranged from 0.05 to 1 kN/m2.
   The reaction between sulphites and nitric oxides was a fast pseudo
   second-order reaction. The order in Na2SO3, K2SO3 and (NH4)2SO3 Was
   found to be zero whereas the order in NO was found to be 2 in all cases.
   The values of activation energy have been reported.}},

   evaluation of the settling velocities of the various discrete particle
   diameters having specific gravities ranging from 2.65 to 1.001 and for
   the temperature range of 5-40-degrees-C. Using these nomograms, an
   integrated expression was evolved based on the polynomial fitting
   concept to predict the settling velocity of the discrete particles in
   relation to the particle diameter, specific gravity of the particle and
   kinematic viscosity (or temperature) of the suspending liquid, Such an
   expression can be used conveniently, instantly and directly to determine
   thc settling velocity of any discrete particle diameter of given
   specific gravity and temperature without performing tedious and repeated
   trial and error calculations.}},

   sample was seeded with an enterovirus and two different coliphages to
   determine if, in the treatment process train, the water was affected in
   such a way that the efficiency of the chosen method for viral detection
   would be adversely influenced.  Recovery efficiencies with seeded
   enterovirus varied from 40 to 68\%.  Coliphage recoveries were
   considerably lower, ranging from 4 to 12\%.  Recovery of seeded phi-X174
   from the water samples demonstrated a statistically significant inverse
   correlation with water temperature.  The results indicate the importance

   were examined using 48 independent, experimentally designed trials in a

   used to establish the significance of temperature, turbidity, pH, ozone
   dose and contact time on G. muris cyst infectivity.  Temperature, pH,
   applied ozone dose and the ozone dose x pH and temperature x pH
   interactions were found to be statistically significant (P
   less-than-or-equal-to 0.05) in ozone demand-free 0.05 M phosphate
   buffer.  Contact time in demand-free buffer was significant up to 2 min
   (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.05), but not beyond.  When experiments were
   done using natural surface waters, contact times up to 5 min were
   required for inactivation, indicating that caution must be used in the
   application of laboratory water results to real waters.  It was found
   that residual and utilized ozone both had important influences in G.
   muris cyst inactivation.  It was more difficult to achieve 2 or 3 log
   inactivation of G. muris cysts in the natural waters at 22-degrees-C

   10(-4) M; a range commonly occurring in electroplating rinsewater.
   A population balance model was used to compute the nucleation and
   particle growth rates and relate these to the supersaturation ratio. 
   Particle growth rates found in the presence of citrate were much lower
   than that in the absence of citrate.  The examination of growth
   inhibition suggested that the mechanism was surface reaction controlled.}},

Abstract = {{Among environment scientists, the current and almost universally
   accepted definition of dissolved constituents is an operational one-only
   those materials which pass through a 0.45-mu-m membrane filter are
   considered to be dissolved.  Detailed laboratory and field studies on Fe
   and Al indicate that a number of factors associated with filtration,
   other than just pore size, can substantially alter ``dissolved{''} trace
   element concentrations; these include:  filter type, filter diameter,
   filtration method, volume of sample processed, suspended sediment
   concentration, suspended sediment grain-size distribution, concentration
   of colloids and colloidally-associated trace elements and concentration
   of organic matter.  As such, reported filtered-water concentrations
   employing the same pore size filter may not be equal.  Filtration
   artifacts may lead to the production of chemical data that indicate
   seasonal or annual ``dissolved{''} chemical trends which do not reflect
   actual environmental conditions.  Further, the development of worldwide
   averages for various dissolved chemical constituents, the quantification
   of geochemical cycles, and the determination of short- or long-term
   environmental chemical trends may be subject to substantial errors, due
   to filtration artifacts, when data from the same or multiple sources are
   combined.  Finally, filtration effects could have a substantial impact
   on various regulatory requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Degradation of polychlorinated phenols was studied in continuous-flow
   fluidized-bed reactors using pure oxygen for aeration and celite carrier
   for cell immobilization.  High dilution rates and chlorophenols as the
   only source of carbon and energy were used for maintenance of the mixed
   biofilm cultures.  The chlorophenol degradation performance was
   monitored as release of inorganic chloride and removal of total organic
   carbon and by direct gas chromatographic analyses.  Continuous
   polychlorophenol biodegradation activity was maintained in a
   fluidized-bed reactor for 315 days.  Chloride release and chlorophenol
   removal efficiencies of over 99\% were achieved at substrate loading
   rates of up to 430 g 2,4,6-trichlorophenol/m3/d and 400 g
   2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol/m3/d at 3-5 h hydraulic retention times,
   respectively.  Immobilized mixed cultures biodegraded
   2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol with partial efficiency at feed concentrations
   as high as 157 mg/l as indicated by inorganic chloride release. 
   Inorganic chloride release in experiments with practical grade
   2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol exceeded that which is possible by
   dechlorination of tetrachlorophenol alone suggesting dechlorination of
   unidentified chlorinated impurities of the preparation as well. 
   Fluidized-bed treatment of simulated wood preservative contaminated
   groundwater at a chlorophenol loading rate of 217 g/m3/d and 5 h
   hydraulic retention time resulted in the following removal efficiencies:
   99.5\% for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, 99.6\% for 2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol
   and 92.5\% for pentachlorophenol.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of the biological and chemical characteristics of effluents
   without secondary (i.e. biological) treatment from Canadian
   newsprint/specialty mills was completed.  The acute lethal toxicity of
   the effluents to rainbow trout, fathead minnows and Ceriodaphnia,
   expressed as LC50s, ranged from approximately 5 to approximately 50\%. 
   Sublethal effects on minnow growth occurred at approximately 2 to
   approximately 15\% concentrations, whereas effects on Ceriodaphnia
   reproduction occurred at approximately 0.01 to approximately 2\% levels.
   The impact of these effluents on Photobacterium phosphoreum (Microtox
   test) occurred at levels similar to those affecting minnow growth.  The
   growth of algae was a less sensitive response than even acute lethal
   toxicity to fish or Ceriodaphnia.  The concentrations of wood
   extractives in the effluents correlated well with acute lethal toxicity,
   but could not fully explain all toxic effects.  The ranking of the
   impact of the effluent only on the basis of pulping process was not
   possible due to a range of other seemingly more important variables
   which could affect the effluent quality including the wood furnish, age
   of wood and other as yet unidentified factors.}},

Abstract = {{Results of studies conducted to investigate the effect of some of the
   variables viz. sorbent mass input rate, sorbate flow-rate, initial
   sorbate concentration on the removal of fluoride by adsorption on
   fishbone charcoal in a moving media adsorption system, are presented. 
   The ratio of attained equilibrium sorbate concentration to the initial
   sorbate concentration and the fluoride removal capacity of sorbent were
   found to vary inversely with the sorbent mass input rate whereas they
   varied directly with the sorbate flow rate and initial sorbate
   concentration.  Empirical relationships have been developed to predict
   the ratio of attained equilibrium sorbate concentration to the initial
   sorbate concentration and the fluoride removal capacity of sorbent with
   respect to the variables investigated for the observed test conditions. 
   The conventional isotherms (Langmuir and Freudlich isotherms) showed no
   good correlations for the data of the presented study.  Correlation
   equations for the moving media adsorption system have been evolved.  The
   ratio of attained equilibrium sorbate concentration to the initial
   sorbate concentration was found to be a function of sorbent-sorbate mass
   input rates ratio.  Also, a model between these parameters manifesting a
   fairly high coefficient of correlation is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The use of the least-squares techniques for parameter estimation is
   critically evaluated by analyzing linear and non-linear models for
   situations in which the absolute or relative errors had a constant
   variance.  Special emphasis is given to the estimation of the
   Monod-model parameters using biodegradation batch-test data.  The error
   structure determines the optimum least-squares technique to be used for
   parameter estimation.  The traditional absolute least-squares criterion,
   which minimizes the sum of the absolute residuals, should be used only
   when the absolute error has variance homogeneity.  On the other hand,
   the non-traditional relative least-squares criterion, which minimizes
   the sum of the relative residuals, is the proper choice for cases in
   which the relative error has an approximately constant variance, a
   common characteristic for many analytical assays.  The superiority of
   the relative residuals criterion is accentuated when the magnitude of
   the dependent variable varies widely.}},

Abstract = {{The study was carried out in southern Finland in a municipal sewage

   equivalent of 2600.  The study period was 407 days.  Polluted
   groundwater led to the plant caused a chlorophenol (CP) concentration in
   the influent of 4-120-mu-g/l.  CP removal averaged 71\%.  The proportion
   of the fed CP stored in the activated sludge was 0.2\% and the dewatered
   sludge contained 1.8\%, while 1\% of the CP vaporized.  Therefore, 68\%
   of the CP led to the process was degraded.  Percent removal of BOD, COD
   and phosphorus stayed high in spite of the CP feeding.  However,
   occurrence of nitrification decreased the pH value in the aeration basin
   and the percent CP removal.  Satisfactory CP removal was achieved when
   the solids retention time (SRT) exceeded 10 days.  The concentrations of
   chloroanisoles, -guaiacols and -catechols in the influent, effluent and
   sludges were below detectable limits.}},

Abstract = {{Land treatment of an aged oily sludge was investigated to determine the
   loss of organic constituents.  The oily sludge was applied to field
   plots of a moderately permeable silt loam soil.  The plots consisted of
   four replicates each of natural controls, rototilled controls and
   several application rates.  Sludge was applied at three different times
   over a two-year period and at seven sludge application rates that ranged
   from 0.09 to 5.25\% oil and grease by weight in the soil zone of
   incorporation.
   Application of the sludge increased the pH, temperature and volatile
   matter of the soil.  The half-life of the total oil and grease ranged
   from about 260 to about 400 days.  Naphthalenes, alkanes and specific
   aromatics were rapidly lost from the soil.  The half-life of these
   compounds generally was less than 30 days.  Not all of the applied
   organics were lost.  A refractory component of about 20-25\% of the
   applied oil and grease accumulated in the soil.  Based on laboratory
   earthworm studies, the residual organics did not appear to have a
   permanent adverse impact to the soil biota.}},

   source.  Effective flocculation was associated with the precipitation of
   2-3.5 g equiv m-3 of Mg2+.  The minimum seawater concentration for

Abstract = {{In the analysis of water quality data, samples with concentrations below
   the analytical detection limit are sometimes replaced by a constant
   between 0 and the detection limit.  The performance of this replacement
   method has previously been examined in Monte Carlo studies by several
   authors.  In this paper, expressions for the expectation of the sample
   mean and variance, obtained under the replacement method, are given for
   normally and lognormally distributed data.  These expressions provide a
   simple means of calculating the bias and mean square error of the
   estimators used in the replacement method and thus large numbers of
   samples do not need to be generated by computer to evaluate the method. 
   Thus, in a particular situation, the bias to be expected can be
   calculated if limits on the ranges of the mean, variance and proportion
   censored are available.  It is shown that without knowledge of these
   qualities, which is the usual situation when data are being analyzed,
   the size and direction of bias is unknown.  More objective methods of
   estimation are the methods of maximum likelihood and log-probability
   regression which are either described or made available through
   references.  Two examples are analyzed by the latter methods and the
   results compared with those of the replacement method.}},

Abstract = {{Orthophosphate and hexametaphosphate from waters have been removed by
   precipitation with aluminium sulphate and calcium nitrate, respectively,
   with subsequent removal by a high gradient magnetic separator using
   magnetite as the seeding material.  The precipitation is strongly
   dependent on pH.  The pH for maximum removal of orthophosphate was 4,
   whereas for hexametaphosphate the pH was 12.  The maximum has been
   attributed to the predominance of hydroxy aluminium dihydrogen phosphate
   species in the case of orthophosphate and hydroxy apatite in the case of
   hexametaphosphate.  The infrared spectra indicate the formation of these
   precipitates.  The removal with a high gradient magnetic separator is
   very efficient and very large throughputs can be achieved.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory research has indicated that a possible cause of low F/M
   filament bulking in ND (nitrification-denitrification) and NDBEPR
   (nitrification-denitrification biological excess phosphorus removal)
   systems occurs as a result of competition for substrate between
   filamentous and floc-forming organisms which have different
   denitrification pathways.  In ND and NDBEPR systems alternating
   anoxic-aerobic conditions prevail and continuous utilization of
   particulate slowly biodegradable COD (SBCOD) by floc-forming organisms
   in these systems leads to accumulation of the denitrification
   intermediates nitrite (NO2-) and nitric oxide (NO) under anoxic
   conditions.  It is proposed that a cause for low F/M filament bulking is
   that the intermediate NO inhibits the utilization of SBCOD by
   floc-formers under subsequent aerobic conditions, with high
   concentrations of NO2- exacerbating this effect, thereby allowing
   filamentous organisms, which do not accumulate NO, to dominate.  Some
   experimental evidence to support this proposal is presented.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication or ``nuisance{''} algal growth causes negative impacts on
   coral reefs via a number of routes and can eventually lead to the
   replacement of the coral community with various flora and fauna (e.g.
   attached algae, seagrasses and detrital/filter feeders).  Chlorophyll a
   appears to be the best water quality indicator of eutrophication and a
   eutrophication threshold value at or below an annual mean of 0.5 mg m-3
   is suggested.  The concentrations of nutrients N and P associated with
   the onset eutrophication in coral reef communities are less well defined
   (annual mean DIN approximately 1-mu-M; P-PO4 approximately 0.1-0.2-mu-M)
   but are in accord with eutrophication threshold levels for sensitive
   freshwater ecosystems.  The proliferation of nitrogen fixing algae in
   pristine coral reef regions highlights the importance of phosphorus and
   trace components such as Mo and Fe and even soluble organic matter to
   the overall primary production.  The concentration of nutrients and
   levels of chlorophyll a in some regions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR)
   lagoon are comparable to those that would be classed as eutrophic in
   other coral reef regions of the world.  The available evidence points to
   riverine run-off as the cause of elevated P-PO4 levels in the inner
   lagoon.  Historical evidence indicates that the levels of P-PO4 and
   phytoplankton growth, and particularly that of Trichodesmium spp, are
   relatively high in the river affected areas and that the levels may have
   significantly increased in the inner lagoon over the past 50-60 years. 
   The nitrogen-fixing ability of Trichodesmium suggests that increased
   levels of P alone may be driving increased levels of primary
   productivity in the lagoon.  It is hypothesized that the
   riverine-promoted eutrophication is a significant factor in the demise
   of fringing reefs in the inner GBR lagoon.  The recorded levels of nano
   plankton growth in some river-affected regions of the GBR lagoon are
   sufficient to promote the survival of Acanthaster planci (crown of
   thorns starfish) larvae and as such eutrophication could well be a
   principal causative factor of the crown of thorns outbreaks.  Elevated
   levels of nutrients and algal growth occur in some outer regions of the
   GBR but these appear to be due to natural phenomena.  The high
   background concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton in both the
   inner and outer GBR, whether they are natural or not, demands that
   special precautions be exercised in the control of sewage effluents and
   run-off in the vicinity of coral reefs.}},

Abstract = {{Deep lagooning is an alternative to conventional lagooning and it
   implies smaller land requirements as an additional advantage.  Treatment
   in deep wastewater stabilization ponds is influenced by thermal
   stratification.  The object of this paper is the study, over a 1-yr
   period (October 1986-December 1987), of the influence of temperature on
   the behaviour of a treatment unit (an 8 m deep pond) which receives
   domestic wastewater.  For this study, a spatiotemporal follow-up of the
   natural treatment process has been conducted.  The removal efficiencies
   achieved for the following parameters varied as follows:  COD, 71-92\%;
   BOD5, 83-97\%; total Kjeldahl nitrogen, 51-98.8\%; ammonia nitrogen,
   38.8-99.9\%; total phosphorus, 42.2-92.9\% and orthophosphate, 40-99\%. 
   Log reduction of microorganisms varied between 2.0 and 3.0 for total
   coliforms, 1.1-3.0 for faecal coliforms and 1.7-3.3 for faecal
   streptococcus.  Other physiochemical parameters observed were: 
   temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, nitrates and nitrites.
   The continuous flow of wastewater did not hinder the appearance of a
   marked stratification in spring-summer:  an aerobic epilimnetic zone and
   an anaerobic hypolimnetic one remained clearly differentiated.  The
   evolution of all the parameters observed was similar.  In the absence of
   thermal stratification, the system was found to function in
   approximately complete mixing conditions, and the value of each
   parameter was almost constant throughout the water column; nevertheless,
   the presence of stratification caused a vertical distribution with
   marked gradients in the thermocline zone.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the potential of
   selected enzyme activity assays to determine microbial abundance and
   heterotrophic activity in waste water and activated sludge.  In waste
   water, esterase and dehydrogenase activities were found to correlate
   with microbial abundance measured as colony forming units of
   heterotrophic bacteria.  A panel of four enzyme activity assays,
   alpha-glucosidase, alanine-aminopeptidase, esterase and dehydrogenase
   were used to characterize activated sludge and anaerobic hydrolysis
   sludge from a pilot scale plant.  The enzymatic activity profiles were
   distinctly different, suggesting that microbial populations were
   different, or had different physiological properties, in the two types
   of sludge.  Enzyme activity profiles in activated sludge from four
   full-scale plants seemed to be highly influenced by the composition of
   the inlet.  Addition of hydrolysed starch was, for instance, reflected
   in a high alpha-glucosidase activity.  However, no obvious correlations
   between specific process parameters and enzyme activities were found.}},

Abstract = {{Primary biodegradation kinetics of a typical commercial mixture of
   linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS), containing alkyl homologues in
   the range of C-10 to C-13, has been investigated using three mixed
   bacterial cultures. Two of the cultures originated from the Krka River
   Estuary (freshwater layer and saline layer) while the third one
   originated from the adjacent coastal waters. Determination of the
   remaining LAS during the biodegradation experiments was performed using
   reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which
   allowed specific determinations of individual homologues and/or isomers.
   Results obtained under static conditions (die-away method) have shown
   that the biodegradation rate depended strongly upon the origin of the
   bacterial culture, the temperature condition, and the structure of
   alkylbenzene moiety. The mixed bacterial culture originating from the
   freshwater layer of the estuary revealed a significantly greater ability
   to degrade LAS than that from the underlying saline water layer or from
   the reference marine station. The biodegradation rate was significantly
   higher in summer (23-degrees-C) than in winter (14-degrees-C)
   temperature conditions. When comparing biodegradation rates of the
   individual homologues, the highest rate was observed for those with the
   longest alkyl chain. For different isomers of the same homologue, it has
   been noticed that biodegradation rate increased with increasing distance
   of the sulphophenyl group from the terminal methyl group.}},

Abstract = {{The photolysis half-life of aqueous chlorine in clear sky, summer noon
   sunlit (47-degrees-N) water of pH 8 is 12 min when measured at the
   surface.  It increases with decreasing pH due to the decreasing ratio of
   OCl-/HOCl to 60 min at pH 5.  The pseudo-first-order rate constant for
   the photolysis of HOCl becomes 2 x 10(-4) s-1 and that of OCl- 1.2 x
   10(-3) s-1.  The variation of the rate of photolysis with depth was
   calculated for water columns exhibiting different light absorption
   coefficients by taking into account that, for both HOCl and OCl-, the
   most effective wavelength for photolysis in sunlight is approx. 330 nm. 
   These results show that in water treatment, chlorine photolysis should
   be minimized whenever possible by operating at low pH, sun shielding or
   night-time addition of chlorine or avoiding storage in shallow
   reservoirs.  The rate of chlorine photolysis controls the formation of
   OH radical which acts as a secondary highly reactive photooxidant (see
   Part II).
   On u.v. (255 nm) irradiation both HOCl and OCl- photolyze at comparable
   rates and slowly enough that chlorine depletion will not occur during
   the time of irradiation typical in u.v. disinfection.
   Photolysis can also contribute to the depletion of chlorine in
   atmospheric waters whenever chlorine is formed by (slow) ozonation of
   chloride.}},

   (pH > 8), both at sunlight wavelengths and at 255 nm.  HOCl (pH 5)
   yielded 0.7 OH at sunlight wavelengths and 0.9 OH at 255 nm.  The OH
   radical produced would oxidize any organic compound present following
   well-established competition kinetics.  Sunlight photodegradation of
   chlorine decreased chloroform formation in filtered lake water due to
   destruction of the chlorine residual.}},

Abstract = {{The study of radioactivity in the phosphate fertilizers and waters of
   the Kanovci area was performed in order to determine the influence of
   the application of phosphate fertilizers on the radioactivity of waters.
   The activity of Ra-226, Ra-228, U-235 and U-238 was measured in
   different types of phosphate fertilizers and waters by means of
   gamma-ray spectrometry. Surface water, water from drainage channels,
   shallow groundwater and deep groundwater samples were collected from the
   Kanovci agricultural and well field area in Eastern Slavonia, where
   phosphate fertilizers have been used for the past 15 years. Cs-137 was
   also measured in water samples.
   The typical phosphate fertilizer used in the Kanovci area contains 75 Bq
   kg-1 of Ra-226, 9 Bq kg-1 of Ra-228, 52 Bq kg-1 of U-235 and 1120 Bq
   kg-1 of U-238. The estimated annual deposition of uranium and radium in
   soils of the agricultural and well field area in Kanovci is: 4.5 Bq m-2
   for Ra-226, 0.5 Bq m-2 for Ra-228, 3.1 Bq m-2 for U-235 and 67 Bq m-2
   for U-238.
   The greatest concentrations of both uranium isotopes are measured in
   water from drainage channels with a mean value of 120 Bq m-3 for U-238
   and 5.5 Bq m-3 for U-235. The concentrations of both radium isotopes
   generally increase with depth of water as distinct from uranium, whose
   concentrations in deep groundwater are much lower. The highest
   concentrations of Cs-137 were measured in water from drainage channels;
   it was not detected in deep groundwater. The U-238/Ra-226 activity ratio
   (AR) is the highest in water from drainage channels and the Bosut River,
   while in deep groundwater the ratio is only 1.6. Results indicate that
   high uranium concentrations in surface water, shallow groundwater and
   water from drainage channels are caused by phosphate fertilizer
   application in agriculture on the Kanovci area.}},

Abstract = {{Linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS), manufactured by the sulphonation
   of linear alkylbenzenes (LAB), became the major anionic surfactant
   material used in detergent formulations in the 1960s and they have
   maintained that status to the present day.  Commercially produced LAS
   may contain 1-3\% unreacted LAB which are only biodegraded under aerobic
   conditions.  As a result any LAB removed by adsorption onto sewage
   solids during primary treatment, and which is subjected to anaerobic
   digestion, will be present on the sludge at the end of the treatment
   process.  Some of the sewage sludge generated is disposed of to
   agricultural land.  A monitoring exercise to determine the concentration
   and isomer distribution of linear alkylbenzenes in sewage sludges and
   sludge amended soils is described.  Concentrations of LAB in various
   sludges ranged from 116 to 388-mu-g g-1 (dry wt).  In fields spread with
   sludge prior to 1989 the concentration of LAB was generally < 5 ng g-1
   soil (dry wt).  Comparison of these data with the estimated total
   cumulative load based on known sludge application history indicates
   losses of > 99\% for the majority of sites.  Time course experiments
   indicate rapid removal of LAB from sludge amended soils.  Calculated
   half lives for the various alkyl homologues are similar (12-15 days). 
   Phenyl isomer distribution in soils suggests, however, preferential
   biodegradation of the external isomers.  This is confirmed in time
   course samples which show half lives of 4.5 days for the 2-phenyl
   isomers and 20 days for the 6/7-phenyl isomers.}},

Abstract = {{Published equations relating phosphorus (P) lake concentrations (P(l))
   to mean P inflow concentrations (P(in)) and water retention time (t(w))
   were shown to consistently underestimate P(l)-values for a data set of
   10 Northern Ireland (N.I.) lakes which had t(w) values of 0.04-1.67 yr. 
   However the ratio of P(l)/P(in) was shown to be strongly related (r2 =
   0.81) to the reciprocal of (1 + t(w)) in the form of P(l)/P(in) =
   1.189/(1 + square-root t(w)) 1.135.  A multiple regression of log P(l)
   vs log P(in) and log (1 + square-root t(w)) gave an r2-value of 0.955
   and indicated that there was an almost linear relationship between P(l)
   and P(in) where:  P(l) = 1.234 (P(in))0.991/(1 + square-root t(w))1.130.
   A relationsip between P(l) vs P(in) and t(w) derived from the first
   equation in which P(l) is directly proportional to P(in) was shown to
   have similar predictive powers to the multiple regression equation and
   is proposed as a basis for a P loading model for N.I. lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The ozonation of quinoline in aqueous solution has been studied at
   varying pH (1.8-6.5).  The effects of direct and radicalic ozonation
   mechanisms upon process development are separately investigated by means
   of radical scavenger (t-BuOH 20 mM) addition to the reacting system.
   Direct ozonation of both quinoline and quinolinium ion leads mainly to
   production of quinolinic acid with a minor occurrence of cleavage
   reactions of the hetercyclic ring.  Higher system reactivities are
   observed for ozonation experiments with no radical scavenger addition
   with small changes occurring in the distribution of products deriving
   from quinoline oxidation.  System behaviors at varying experimental
   conditions are explained on the basis of chemical reaction schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper defines the structure and dynamics of the planktonic
   populations before and after the addition of reclaimed effluents to an
   operational irrigation reservoir.  The analysis of the effects of the
   inflow of the effluents on the parameters that characterize the
   planktonic populations may serve to determine the means that have to be
   taken to improve the quality of the water used for drip irrigation.  The
   planktonic communities in the reservoir were defined by factor analysis.
   The input of effluents led to a change from phyto- and zooplankton
   communities dominated by small species, to communities dominated by
   large species (greater than 200-mu-m).  This change was characterized by
   an increase in biomass without an increase in the total number of algae.
   The dominating algae were species of Cyanophyta which responded to the
   input of N compounds rather than to the increase in phosphate
   concentration.  Laboratory enrichment experiments support the idea that
   the limiting factor was the N compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Periphyton biomass on natural substrata at 26 sites above and below
   point source discharges in 7 New Zealand streams was compared with
   maximum potential values predicted by a laboratory calibrated model to
   determine the extent to which biomass was controlled by nutrients. 
   Point-source enrichment, which increased dissolved reactive phosphorus
   (DRP) from 6 to 100 times the saturation level (about 25-mu-g/l) in five
   streams, was found to substantially increase biomass at all enriched
   sites in four streams.  In two of these streams, biomass below the
   enrichment inputs was about 1200 mg chl a/m2.  Overall, biomass averaged
   only 35 +/- 44\% of that predicted from phosphorus, velocity and
   temperature using the model.  Furthermore, aesthetically nuisance
   biomass levels (i.e. > 200 mg chl a/m2) were observed at only 7 of the
   19 downstream sites.  In many cases, the lower than expected biomass
   levels were associated with high macroinvertebrate grazer densities,
   riparian shading or unsuitable attachment surfaces.  These factors,
   therefore, appear to have exercised more control on periphyton biomass
   than nutrients, and may offer more effective alternatives for biomass
   control in enriched streams than lowering DRP below biomass saturating
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{Counts of presumptive E. coli were enumerated for 55 samples of surface
   water by membrane filtration using membrane lauryl sulphate broth (MLSB)
   and tryptone bile agar (TBA).  The latter medium gives a direct count of
   indole positive coliforms (presumptive E. coli) at 44-degrees-C without
   the need for subculturing.  After incubation, membranes are floated on a
   modified indole reagent which causes indole positive colonies to stain
   pink.  Both media gave similar counts for presumptive E. coli and it was
   concluded that TBA was a suitable alternative medium to conventional
   media.  Subculturing of colonies for further tests was not necessary and
   consequently results were available 1 day earlier.  A limited study was
   carried out with marginally chlorinated waters and both media gave
   comparable results.}},

Abstract = {{Sand used in rapid filter experiences changes with respect to quality
   and granulometric parameters, during its operating life time.  Developed
   in the surface of its grains is a film, the colour of which, brown or
   black, indicates the presence of various materials:  this is associated
   with the ``ripening{''} of sand.  The study on the evolution and quality
   of silica sand of filters of Villa Azul's Water Plant after 2, 21 and 34
   yr of service, indicates that the accumulation of organic and inorganic
   materials in the above-mentioned film, experiences a strong increase
   with time.  Mn, Fe, Al (and Ca and Mg) are the main metals present in
   the film; also, an important percentage of sulphate was detected.  With
   respect to granulometric aspects of the sand, there is a considerable
   deviation from the standard curve after 21 yr.
   Sand regeneration methods with acids are not advisable.  In accordance
   with results, the total replacement of sand after 35 yr of service is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the effects of polyphosphate, a model ligand
   which forms strong complexes with metals, on metal sorption onto
   ferrihydrite.  Adsorption experiments were conducted to study the
   partitioning of metal ions in systems containing a range of metal and
   ligand concentrations.  The sorption of ligands, the associated sorption
   of charge and complexation of metals by ligands are important in
   controlling metal partitioning.  In metal-free systems, the apparent
   maximum adsorption density is about 0.1 mol of polyphosphate per mol of
   Fe.  The sorption of metals and/or metal-ligand complexes increases the

   are not present.  At total polyphosphate concentrations less than that
   needed to saturate the oxide surface, the presence of polyphosphate
   enhances the sorption of metals.  When the concentration of
   polyphosphate exceeds that needed to saturate the oxide surface, the
   sorption of metals diminishes due to both the competition between
   dissolved and surface polyphosphate for metal ions and the dissolution
   of iron oxides.}},

Title = {{REMOVAL OF HUMIC ACIDS IN WATER-TREATMENT BY GRAFTED CELLULOSES}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1992}},

Abstract = {{Humic substances (HS) are natural constituents of surface water,
   especially in regions with a cold climate where the content of humic
   substances may be high, since low temperature is a condition for the
   formation of the water-extractable HS.
   The removal of humic substances is today one of the most important
   targets in EEC water purification technology.  The conventional process
   is coagulation-flocculation separation to remove HS responsible for
   haloform formation during chlorination of humic rough water.
   The development of macroporous resins since the late fifties has created
   an increasing interest in humic acids removal by ion exchange in surface
   waters; there are today several different types of resins available for
   this purpose (Boening et al., 1980; Lecloirec and Martin, 1985;
   Daignault et al., 1988; Brattebo et al., 1987).  However, study is
   continued in order to modify this process especially Lewatit (Hongve,
   1989) which exists at only one full-scale plant in Europe (Brattebo et
   al., 1987).
   For utilization as ion exchangers and particularly as purification
   agents for textile industrial effluents, celluloses substituted by
   quaternary ammonium functions have been prepared and manufactured by the
   Institut Textile de France (Lyon; Cuvelier et al., 1970).
   For this synthesis, the quaternary ammonium celluloses have been
   obtained by cellulose condensation with epoxy propyltriethylammonium
   chloride.  Synthesis of this salt in the presence of celluloses has been
   achieved so that the grafted ammonium cellulose could be obtained from
   celluloses and epichlorhydrin in one step (Gangneux et al., 1976). 
   These modified celluloses are very strong anion exchangers (pK(a) =
   12.9).
   The present study describes the removal of humic compounds in water by
   grafted cellulose AE2, only one similar study is reported in literature
   (Jorgensen, 1979).
   Materials and methods
   The humic material (HcS Aldrich) was treated by the Schnitzer and Khan
   method (1972) in order to obtain humic acids (HcA).  Natural fulvic
   acids (FA) were from Canadian's Agriculture Source (Schnitzer and
   Skinner, 1963).
   The kinetic and isotherm experiments were carried out using a batch
   process by shaking 20 ml of solution in flasks for 24 h at 23-degrees-C
   (pH of solution:  7.5 +/- 0.2).
   After shaking, the suspension was filtered through a 0.3-mu-m Sartorius
   membrane filter prior to photometric u.v. determination (254 nm) of the
   remaining humic acids concentration in the filtrate.
   Results and discussion
   Kinetics (Figs 1 and 2) and isotherms (Table 1) of exchange, effects of
   mineral salts (Tables 3 and 4) (NaCl, CaCl2, Na2SO4, Na3PO4) and forms
   of cellulose (Cl-, OH-) have been studied.
   The isotherms were expressed by the Freundlich and Langmuir equations
   and the data (Table 1) showed that the grafted cellulose strong base was
   10-fold better than activated carbon for the removal of HA from the
   water and competitive with anionic resins.
   The results (Table 2) showed that PAC and synthetic resins adsorb HS
   because (i) the large molecular weight humic acids did not penetrate the
   micropores and (ii) the polyaromatic structure of these materials was
   known to be favourable for adsorption.  The grafted cellulose AE2 was a
   pure anionic exchanger; no adsorption occurred for humic substances with
   a 24 h contact time with no grafted cellulose.
   The results (Figs 1 and 2; Table 1) showed that modified cellulose with
   a low capacity (0.3-0.5 mequiv. g-1) gave a high treatment efficiency
   due to the good exchange characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Surface water and sediments from the St Lawrence River system (Quebec
   region) were analysed for genotoxicity using the SOS Chromotest, as well
   as for their chemical concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   and heavy metals.  Additionally, chlorobenzenes, polychlorinated
   biphenyls, organochlorinated pesticides, ammonia and nitrite
   concentrations in sediments were determined.  Water and sediments
   sampled from twenty-five sites were initially partitioned into their
   aqueous and particulate phases by tangential flow filtration and
   centrifugation, respectively.  Organic contaminants were extracted from
   the fractions with dichloromethane.  For surface water, fifteen extracts
   of filtered water and seven of particulates, and for sediments one
   extract of pore water and three of particulates proved to be weakly
   genotoxic.  All but one of the genotoxic responses observed in the
   surface water were obtained from samples taken from the highly
   industrial portion of the St Lawrence River system, with the strongest
   responses observed in Lake St Louis.  Surface water genotoxicants
   partitioning favours the particulate fraction.  Bottom particulates
   genotoxicity was 1000-fold weaker than suspended particulates, on a per
   unit weight basis.  Additionally, whole sediments were extracted with a
   10\% dimethylsulfoxide-saline solution.  The observed distributions of
   genotoxicity values did not correlate with observed concentrations of
   demonstrated SOS inducers, mutagens and/or carcinogens, nor with the
   presence of other toxic chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of effluent from the Sitra power and desalination plant
   (SPDP), Bahrain, on the physical and chemical properties of the
   receiving water was investigated.  Two distinguished zones of the
   receiving water were recognized.  These zones resulted from the presence
   of the jetty.  The length of the first zone is about the same length as
   the jetty, 70 m.  The length of the second zone extends to about 150 m. 
   Seventy five case stations were selected on the receiving water.  On the
   intake side, fifteen stations were considered as control stations.  The
   SPDP effluent significantly changed the temperature and salinity of the
   receiving water of the first zone.  The dissolved oxygen levels vary
   slightly from the control stations.  The jetty was found to restrict the
   water circulation of the first zone.  This restriction caused a delay in
   the temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen dispersion.  Beyond the
   first zone, this restriction is removed and the dispersion processes
   affected the control stations.}},

Abstract = {{A simple, one reactor vessel system, called a fill-and-draw system, was
   developed for the study of enhanced biological phosphate removal under
   defined conditions.  Sludge was grown in a medium with acetate and
   glucose as sole energy and carbon sources.  The sludge was exposed to
   cycles with three distinct, consecutive periods; first an anaerobic
   period, then an aerobic period and finally a settlement period.  In the
   period of settlement one third of the liquid was replaced with fresh
   medium.  Sludge grown under this regime became considerably enriched
   with polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria.  The polyphosphate content
   reached up to 110 mg P/g dry weight.  The amount of polyphosphate in the
   cells during steady state depended on the acetate:glucose ratio, the
   nitrate and phosphate concentration in the medium.  Highest phosphate
   accumulation was obtained with an acetate:glucose ratio of 9:1. 
   Intracellular polyphosphate was formed during the aerobic period and was
   anaerobically hydrolysed and released as phosphate into the medium.  In
   the absence of oxygen and in the presence of 2 g acetate-COD/1, 80-90\%
   of phosphate was released by sludge containing 100 mg P/g dry weight. 
   In the absence of acetate only 2-19\% of the accumulated phosphate was
   excreted.}},

Abstract = {{Batch kinetic experiments were carried out to measure
   conjugative-transfer kinetics for plasmid RP4, which encodes resistance
   to kanamycin, tetracycline and ampicillin.  The donor species was
   Rhodobacter capsulatus, while the recipient was a Pseudomonas strain
   obtained in our laboratory.  Evaluated was a mass-action kinetic model
   that had a donor-to-recipient rate coefficient k(t1) and a
   transconjugant-to-recipient rate coefficient k(t2).  Experimental
   results demonstrated that k(t1) and k(t2) were of similar magnitudes and
   could be reasonably large:  e.g. up to 0.03 l g(T)/g(D) g(R) day for
   k(t1).  However, the rate coefficients were not constants.  Instead,
   they increased dramatically as the energy availability increased. 
   Energy was made available in kinetic experiments from the energy
   substrates and from internal storage materials, carried over from prior
   batch growth cultures.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to show that a relationship exists between
   the average settling velocity of floc particles in the upper layers of a
   secondary clarifier and the concentration of suspended solid within that
   layer.  While it can be theoretically argued that the average settling
   velocity of particles in the flocculent settling zone is independent of
   concentration, the practical and operational constraints of secondary
   clarifiers lead to the conclusion that the average settling velocity of
   flocculent suspensions is correlated to the suspended solids
   concentration.  Analytical expressions describing the concentration and
   average settling velocity of a suspension as a function of particle size
   distribution are presented.  Finally, the relationship between particle
   size distribution and overflow rate is addressed.}},

   bacteria from river waters and attached bacteria onto sand taken from
   drinking water treatment plants.  Variances associated with individual
   components of this study were isolated:  the laboratories represented
   the highest source of variation (56.6-70.7\%), while the inoculum origin
   contribution to the increase of variance is lower (12-26\%).  As a
   conclusion, indigenous mixed bacterial populations (suspended or
   attached bacteria) may be used reliably as standard inocula in BDOC
   determinations without introducing excessive variability.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of a potentially toxic concentration of metals and the
   ineffective destruction of pathogenic microorganisms by conventional
   sludge stabilization processes limit sewage sludge utilization in
   agriculture.  Therefore, we evaluate the metals bioleaching process
   potential for the elimination of indicator bacteria (total coliforms,
   fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci).  Physico-chemical sludge
   characteristics (VS, VSS, soluble carbon and sulfate) as well as metals
   solubilization were also measured.  The results obtained reveal that the
   high sulfuric acid production (pH < 2.5), as a result of sulfur
   oxidation by indigenous thiobacilli of sludge, allows a considerable
   reduction in bacterial indicators (3 log or under the limit detection of
   10(3) cfu/100 ml) for sludges examined over a 5 day period.  Heavy
   metals were solubilized to levels compatible with recommended norms for
   intensive sludge agricultural use.  Moreover, this process allowed a VSS
   reduction, which varied according to the sludge used.  These results
   indicate that this process can improve the stabilization of the digested
   sludge.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies the influence of clay minerals used as supports in
   anaerobic digesters on the precipitation of ammonium magnesium
   phosphate.  The magnesium exchange cation present in the sample
   originally or from experimental saturation plays an important role in
   the precipitation of struvite crystal growth depending on the greater or
   lesser facility of its liberation to the medium.  Vermiculite, and
   probably stevensite, influence the formation of struvite, transferring
   the magnesium cation only from their exchange positions, while sepiolite
   does so by contributing from its structure.  In vermiculite, struvite
   crystal formation is on the edges or fractures of the laminas.  The
   presence of other cations in the supports, such as exchange Ca2+-either
   structural or as a component of accessory minerals, as in the case of
   stevensite-causes precipitation of calcium ammonium phosphate.  In
   minerals with a high iron content, such as nontronite, iron phosphates
   are produced.  The type of digester influences the size of the struvite
   crystals, these being larger in the semi-continuous digesters.}},

   (3) from the storage tank to wastage. The control problem is to
   determine optimal control variable sequences that minimize effluent

Abstract = {{Heavy metals, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and various organics have
   been detected in surface and subsurface water around two peninsular
   landfills.  A possible source of this contamination is a large volume of
   PCB-contaminated oil floating on the water table of Pennsylvania Avenue
   Landfill (PAL); a similar lens is suspected at Fountain Avenue Landfill
   (FAL), but has not yet been defined.  Analysis of historical aerial
   photography of FAL and chemical analysis of soil sampled around seeps
   indicate that historic liquid-containing structures may have held oil
   that is now seeping out of the landfill into surrounding surface water. 
   The use of remote sensing provides a tool to relate prior disposal
   locations to current topography for design of a cost-effective
   geo-exploration effort.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of biofouling in water systems results from microbial
   growth on submerged surfaces.  Biofouling-related problems are often
   overcome by chemical treatment.  However, situations often develop which
   necessitate a complete shutdown in order to allow mechanical cleaning of
   a system as well as replacement of corroded piping material.  Strategies
   additional to chemical treatment are therefore needed to control
   biofouling.  Such strategies may include physical or chemical
   alterations to a water system to create conditions less favourable for
   microbial activity.
   Different fluid velocities were simulated in a single continuous flow
   reactor which enabled the comparison of bacterial colonization of
   surfaces at six different fluid velocities while all other parameters
   were kept constant.  As expected, the highest colonization rates
   occurred at conditions of zero flow, with a decrease in fouling rates
   with an increase of fluid velocity.  In a second set of experiments, the
   influence of dissolved organic carbon concentration on biofouling of
   different types of surfaces was studied.  In these experiments, highest
   colonization rates occurred on stainless steel, followed by aluminium
   and glass.  Direct epifluorescent microscopy techniques were employed to
   enumerate sessile bacteria.  There was a progressive increase in
   corrosion rate with increases in sulphate concentration up to sulphate
   levels greater than 600 mg/l after which there was no further marked
   increase in corrosion rate.}},

Abstract = {{Effects from chlorination and dechlorination of Savannah River water
   were studied during the development of biofouling countermeasures for a
   proposed cooling tower system required for thermal mitigation of nuclear
   reactor cooling water effluent.  Testing was conducted to assess
   chlorine demand and dissipation rates as well as the environmental
   acceptability of using sodium sulfite as a dechlorinating agent. 
   Chlorine demand varied significantly, but in an unpredictable manner
   during seven seasonal sampling dates.  A chlorine dosage of 3-5 mg/l was
   generally adequate to provide a free chlorine residual of 1 mg/l. 
   Static 48-h bioassays with bluegill showed no acute toxicity for
   chlorinated/dechlorinated cooling water containing up to 64 times the
   calculated stoichiometric concentration of sodium sulfite required for
   dechlorination.  Experiments measuring the depletion of dissolved oxygen
   and flow-through (96-h) bioassays with bluegill and largemouth bass
   further substantiated the environmental acceptability of using sodium
   sulfite as a dechlorinating agent.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous complex atmospheric phenomena influence rainfall water quality
   variations in time.  In order to achieve a better understanding of these
   phenomena, an automatic sequential rainfall sampler was developed.  This
   device, controlled by a microprocessor, can be programmed to take
   samples at rainfall depth intervals ranging from 0.032 to 1.6 mm.  It
   also collects total wet fractions.  This method of sampling, based on
   rainfall depth, offers some advantages over the method based on time
   (one sample every given number of time units):  volume of sample is
   identical from one sample to the other; there is no risk of flooding
   sample bottles; and heavy storms as well as long and light rainfalls can
   be handled.  Preliminary results obtained in Montreal with this sampler
   show the large variations of quality encountered during one event. 
   Recalculation of total loads from sequential data compare very well with
   total rainfall loads, illustrating the fact that and the variations are
   not due to random analytical errors but represent actual variations.}},

Abstract = {{To gain a better understanding of the applicability of bacteria with
   special metabolic properties to purify polluted groundwaters, we have
   investigated the mineralization of low concentrations of
   1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) in two different bioreactors which were
   inoculated with a mixture of two pure cultures capable of mineralizing
   DCA.  Degradation experiments were continuously run at neutral pH at
   temperatures of between 10 and 30-degrees-C and in solutions of low
   conductivity (c. 1000-mu-S cm-1) thus simulating groundwater pumped from
   a polluted site.  DCA concentrations in the feed ranged from 1 to 25 mg
   l-1.  Oxygen was monitored in the reaction effluent and was added to the
   feed if required as a solution of H2O2.
   The fixed bed bioreactor with sintered glass beads as carrier was run in
   a flow-through mode with a hydraulic retention time of 2-3 h.  DCA
   mineralization, determined by the disappearance of DCA, the consumption
   of oxygen, the decrease in pH and the formation of chloride ions,
   started 3 weeks after inoculation.  After this time, at least 80\% of
   DCA was mineralized with DCA feed concentrations of 20-25 mg 1(-1).  DCA
   elimination efficiency increased up to 90\% with increasing running
   time.  With a feed concentration of 10 mg l-1 DCA, DCA effluent
   concentration decreased further to below 300-mu-g l-1.  This degradation
   efficiency was independent of the different temperatures applied.
   Using granular activated carbon as carrier material for the
   micro-organisms and running the reactor with a recycle at the same
   hydraulic residence time, mineralization started 5 weeks after
   inoculation.  DCA effluent concentration was between 1 and 2 mg l-1 with
   feed concentrations of up to 20 mg l-1 DCA.  The ability to mineralize

   tolerate transient changes in hydraulic and nitrogen loadings was
   assessed.  In addition the relative efficiencies of a completely mixed
   and a plug-flow reactor operated under the same transient conditions

   hydraulic loading rate with no loss of nitrification efficiency. 
   Increases in nitrogen loading (in the form of either ammonium or urea)
   over the range 50-200 mg-N/1 produced only slight increases in effluent
   ammonium concentration.  However above 200 mg-N/1 the Nitrobacter were
   inhibited and there was a large increase in both effluent ammonium and
   nitrite.  The completely mixed and plug-flow systems behaved almost
   identically and the ability of the former to dilute and dampen transient
   peaks, did not seem to benefit the nitrifying bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a groundwater recharge basin at the Kwinana
   Groundwater Recharge Site in Western Australia was monitored between
   1983 and 1986.  A primary aim of the monitoring programme was to study
   the improvement in the removal of faecal coliforms and nutrients
   (nitrogen and phosphorus) by amending the sand of the recharge basin
   with gypsum-neutralized red mud (fine bauxite refining residue).
   The study consisted of five operating stages.  Stage 1 was a baseline
   study using unamended sand.  Stages 2-5 were after sand amendment with
   red mud.  Continuous flooding and flooding/drying regimes were studied
   with primary effluent or a mixture of primary and secondary effluents.
   Phosphorus removal was maintained at a high level (over 80\%) in all of
   the stages after the sand amendment.  Faecal coliform removal was
   generally excellent, except at the beginning of each stage when primary
   effluent was used, and only a thousand-fold reduction was achieved. 
   Removal improved with time and most monitored bore samples contained no
   faecal coliforms/100 ml.  With one exception the groundwater met water
   quality criteria for irrigation.
   Nitrogen removal of approx. 45\% was obtained with primary effluent
   using a cycle of flooding and drying (stage 3).  Continuous flooding
   with primary effluent (stage 5) did not improve denitrification.  No
   nitrogen removal was observed with a mixture of two-thirds secondary
   effluent and one-third primary effluent.}},

Abstract = {{Column experiments were conducted to examine the removal of phosphorus
   and nitrogen from sewage effluent by passage through sand amended with
   bauxite refining residue (red mud).  Red mud was neutralized with 5\%
   gypsum.  The study was conducted in two parts.  In Part 1 the removal of
   nitrogen and phosphorus in mixtures of 30, 20 and 10\% red mud in sand
   was compared.  Cycles of 10 days flooding with secondary effluent and 18
   days drying were used.  An average of 24\% nitrogen removal was obtained
   with 30\% red mud, 9\% removal with 20\% red mud and very little removal
   with 10\% red mud.  An average of 91\% phosphorus removal was obtained
   with 30\% red mud, 63\% removal with 20\% red mud and 50\% removal with
   10\% red mud.  The decrease in phosphorus and nitrogen removal with
   decreasing red mud content was caused by a decrease in the adsorption
   capacity of the soil and an increase in the infiltration rate.  In Part
   2 the use of primary and secondary effluents was compared.  Phosphorus
   removal was excellent using both primary and secondary effluents in
   columns packed with 30\% red mud.  Nitrogen removal continued to be poor
   using secondary effluent (16\%) but was significantly greater using
   primary effluent (74\%).}},

Abstract = {{Methane-oxidizing bacteria were grown in a fixed biofilm reactor in
   order to study their ability to degrade chlorinated aliphatic
   hydrocarbons.  Focus is on the growth behaviour of the mixed culture. 
   The growth is described by a model that includes methanotrophic bacteria
   in the active biomass fraction.  The inactive biomass fraction consists
   of exocellular polymers and biodegradable and inert particulate biomass.
   The model describes the oxygen respiration in detail.  Yield
   coefficients, decay constants and hydrolysis constants are estimated
   based on the oxygen respiration.  An analysis of the observability of
   the system reveals that several of the coefficients cannot be determined
   explicitly due to the complexity of the model and the limited amount of
   variables measured.  Estimation procedures based on least squares
   methods are employed and parameter estimates and confidence intervals
   are computed.  The study forms the basis for setting up a future
   measuring programme.  This work indicates a yield coefficient for
   methanotrophs of 0.36 mg biomass COD per mg CH4.  In weight units this
   corresponds to approx. 1.44 mg biomass per mg CH4.  This is close to the
   theoretical maximum growth yield for methanotrophs.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of cadmium, copper, lead, the organic compounds of
   lead and eight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been measured in
   surface drainage waters from a major rural highway in north-west England
   during a number of runoff events.  The particulate phase (> 0.45-mu-m)
   contained > 90\% of the inorganic Pb, approximately 70\% of the Cu and
   approximately 56\% of the Cd and the particulate-phase metal
   concentration profiles largely followed those of the suspended
   sediments.  A ``first-flush{''} effect was seen for the dissolved
   metals.  A highly significant correlation was found between the length
   of the antecedent dry period and the amount of lead and dissolved copper
   removed during a runoff event but this was not found for the other
   pollutants.  A simple regression model allows the reliable first-order
   approximation of lead concentrations and removal rates in the runoff
   waters to be made from the discharge rate and the length of the
   antecedent dry period.  Budget calculations show that approximately 8\%
   of the Pb, 5\% of the organic lead and 3\% of the PAHs emitted by
   vehicles are removed in the highway drainage waters.}},

   matter under controlled conditions.  Winter hill association (raw peat)
   is subjected to prolonged natural drying to induce a range of moisture
   deficits.  This peat is then subjected to rainfall simulation. 
   Throughflow colour relates to drought duration and near surface water
   loss and rewetting.  Attention is paid to the role of pore spaces in
   colour generation and removal.  The implications for moorland management
   and the long term pattern of water discolouration are considered.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment and suspended solid samples were collected from Lake
   Volkerak/Zoom in The Netherlands.  The samples were used for the
   determination of 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene and cadmium sorption
   coefficients and for the determination of the concentrations of total
   iron, manganese, organic carbon, chlorophyll-a and scandium.  Cadmium
   sorption coefficients were also determined for isolated suspensions of
   Cryptomonas spp.  A statistical analysis of the results indicates that
   the sorption coefficients for tetrachlorobenzene are proportional to the
   organic carbon content, which is highly influenced by algal blooms.  A
   similar analysis shows that cadmium is bound almost completely to the
   geochemical iron, manganese and organic phases, the first being
   exclusively associated with the clay fraction.  Due to a decrease in
   relative clay content during algal blooms, a proportional decrease in
   the cadmium distribution coefficient was found.
   It was found that the data obtained from the statistical analysis are in
   good agreement with reported data for isolated model phases.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The biodegradation behaviour of 5 model chemical contaminants,
   2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D); 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP);
   pentachlorophenol (PCP); 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) and lindane, spiked into
   synthetic peptone sewage to mu-g/l levels (5-1000-mu-g/l) have been
   studied in laboratory activated sludge reactors under a range of
   operating conditions (sludge ages of 1-32 days and sludge loadings of
   0.09-0.9 mg BOD5/mg MLSS/d).  The reactors were continuously stirred
   tanks operated under a computer controlled fill and draw cycle of 4 h. 
   Experiments were started with sludge collected from a municipal
   treatment plant.
   In most experiments, a gradual adaptation took place resulting in
   increases in biodegradation rates by an order of magnitude or more
   compared to initial biodegradation rates and rates obtained in
   comparative batch experiments, respectively.  Times required for
   adaptation varied among chemicals and experiments and ranged from 2-5
   days for 4-NP to 1-2 months for 2,4-D and lindane.  No concentration
   thresholds for adaptation were observed, and the biodegradation
   generally followed first-order kinetics.  Removals by biodegradation in
   successfully adapted systems were generally within a range of about 40
   to about 95\% except for 4-NP, which was degraded to concentration
   levels below the analytical detection limit.  For estimation of the part
   of the total removal which was due to biodegradation the amounts of PCP,
   TCP and lindane wasted with the sludge were calculated from sorption
   isotherms.  Volatilization was negligible.  The operational parameters
   influenced the biodegradation differently for the different chemicals. 
   PCP was degraded best at high sludge ages and was not degraded
   significantly at sludge ages below approx. 8 days.  This suggests
   catabolic degradation by slow growing specific degraders.  TCP was
   consistently degraded at high sludge ages (low sludge loadings) and at
   random at lower sludge ages, but rate constants were highest at
   intermediate sludge loadings.  A similar pattern was seen for 2,4-D. 
   Lindane was degraded poorly at high sludge ages and to a much greater
   extent at intermediate and at high sludge loadings.  These findings
   suggest co-oxidation as the dominant degradation mechanism for lindane
   and as a significant mechanism for TCP and 2,4-D.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents laboratory experiments on the effects of heavy metal
   on nitrate reduction, using natural lake water or a synthetic water
   medium without complexing agents.  A bacteria inoculum consisting of a
   mixed facultatively heterotrophic bacterial culture, nitrate and glucose
   were added to tubes, which were filled to capacity, sealed and incubated
   in the dark at 20-degrees-C.  Nitrate reduction was followed in terms of
   the decrease in added nitrate against time.
   For the synthetic water medium, the effects of Cd, Zn and Pb at
   concentrations of 10-500-mu-g l-1 were tested and for Cu at
   concentrations between 10 and 100-mu-g l-1.  Nitrate reduction in
   natural lake water with and without additions of an external bacterial
   culture was measured.  The effect of an addition of 50-mu-g l-1 of metal
   above the natural level was also investigated.  In synthetic water, a
   50\% decrease in nitrate reduction activity was found at about 25-mu-g
   Cu l-1, 85-mu-g Cd l-1, 95-mu-g Pb l-1 or 200-400-mu-g Zn l-1.  The
   order of toxicity was Cu > Cd > = Pb > Zn.
   In the lake water, nitrate reduction activity decreased with increasing
   metal levels.  From the experiments involving the addition of metal to
   lake water the order of toxicity was found to be Cu > Cd > = Pb > Zn.}},

Abstract = {{Quaternary-ammonium-anion-exchange resins binding tri-iodides or
   penta-iodides were tested for their ability to disinfect water
   containing Legionella pneumophila.  Results indicate that the iodinated
   resins are stable demand-release disinfectants.  No residual iodine was
   detected by amperometric titration in the eluate from tri-iodinated or
   washed penta-iodinated resins.  When an aqueous suspension containing
   2.7 x 10(9) cfu of L. pneumophila per ml was passed through
   tri-iodinated resins, less than 0.004\% were recovered.  No viable cells
   were detected by direct plating from a suspension of 2.3 x 10(9) cfu per
   ml eluted through penta-iodinated resins (> 99.99999\% viability
   reduction).  This disinfectant was less effective if legionellae were
   ingested by Tetrahymena pyriformis before exposure.  Penta-iodinated
   resins were also less active at 4-degrees-C, when tested with water
   designed to inhibit halogen disinfectants and waters containing high
   concentrations of organic matter or total dissolved solids.  Further
   study of penta-iodinated resins as a disinfectant of potable water
   containing L. pneumophila is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{The anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) contains a mixed anaerobic culture
   segregated into compartments.  This paper presents residence time
   distribution studies done on both clean and working reactors, to
   investigate the mixing patterns and dead spaces in this novel type of
   reactor.  The results show that the mixing is characterized by a number
   of theoretical perfectly-mixed compartments which correlates closely
   with the actual number of compartments in the reactor, especially at low
   hydraulic residence times (HRT).  The fraction of dead space in the ABR
   is low compared to other designs of anaerobic digesters.  The dead space
   can be shown to be made up partly of biological dead space (due to
   presence of biomass) which decreases with HRT, and partly of hydraulic
   dead space (due to the flow patterns) which increases with HRT.  Hence
   there is no direct correlation between dead space and HRT.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of porous aggregates during initial mixing is investigated in
   a series of numerical simulations.  Hydrodynamic radii of aggregates
   composed of i primary particles are used to calculate collision rate
   constants as a function of fractal dimension, D, and aggregation number,
   i. D is assumed to be independent of aggregate size.  The rate of floc
   volume formation increases by several orders of magnitude as the fractal
   dimension decreases from 3 to 2.  Neglecting aggregate porosity is
   estimated to introduce an error of < 10\% in calculating the collision
   efficiency factor from particle number measurements and a
   coalescing-sphere model for particle aggregation.  For conditions
   approximating those in which ferric sulfate is added to a rapid mix
   basin, simulations with D = 2.5 produce a volume fraction of flocs
   larger than 1-mu-m that approximates the volume fraction greater than
   1-mu-m measured using an electronic particle counter.  A fractal
   dimension of 2.35 produces an aggregate volume distribution that most
   nearly approximates the volume distribution observed in jar tests with
   ferric sulfate.  These values of D are within the range of values
   reported in the literature for larger ferric hydroxide flocs.  Mixing
   conditions in most full scale installations are likely to favor the
   formation of aggregates of precipitated coagulant particles that are
   sufficiently large for breakup and aggregate restructing to control the
   size distribution of materials leaving the rapid mix basin.}},

   to improve the performance of wastewater process units. There have,
   however, been conflicting reports on the usefulness of such biocatalytic
   additions. The bacterial nature of a particular commercial biocatalyst
   is studied here. Pure culture techniques were used to isolate the
   bacteria growing on selected culture media, and results were compared
   with the bacteria recovered in a laboratory anaerobic digester. The
   limited range of bacteria identified comprised either obligate aerobes
   or facultative anaerobes, and no methanogens were detected. Considering
   that there was no significant difference in the bacterial flora in
   reactors with, as well as without the biocatalytic addition, there was
   therefore insufficient evidence to support the use of the biocatalyst in
   the anaerobic digestion process.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-volatile organic contaminants such as pesticides, PAHs and PCBs, as
   well as their more volatile counterparts, are being found in ground and
   surface waters with increasing frequency.  It has been shown that
   removal of the volatile organic contaminants such as carbon
   tetrachloride and trichloroethene can be performed by membrane-based
   solvent extraction using a non-volatile oil as the solvent.  The
   membrane is microporous polypropylene, coated to prevent wetting of the
   membrane pores by the oil phase.  Solutes volatilize from water into the
   gas-filled membrane pores and are transferred to and concentrated in the
   oil phase.  The hollow fiber shape of the membranes leads to a high
   specific surface area, and a very rapid removal rate; limited in most
   cases only by diffusion of the contaminant through compounds from water
   is assessed.  It is shown that the pesticide lindane
   (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) and two other isomers of
   hexachlorocyclohexane can be removed from water at a rate similar to
   that of the volatile species.  A transport model presented earlier is
   updated to include transfer through the membrane by surface diffusion, a
   mechanism proposed to explain the rapid transfer of species of low
   volatility.  The model predicts rapid removal from water of a wide range
   of organic compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Waste activated sludge was thickened by biological flotation without
   polymer flocculant dosage. The BIOFLOT(R) process utilizes the
   denitrifying ability of activated sludge bacteria. Gaseous products of
   anaerobic nitrate reduction cause spontaneous flotation of the sludge
   suspended solids. Laboratory tests confirmed the dependence of sludge
   thickening efficiency on available nitrate concentration, flotation time
   and temperature. Full-scale experiments were performed in a fully
   automatized unit for discontinuous sludge thickening from wastewater
   treatment plants with a capacity of up to 5000 I.E. Waste activated
   sludge from wastewater treatment plants at Pisek, Milevsko and
   Bjornlunda was thickened from 6.2, 10.7 and 3.5 g/l MLSS to 59.4, 59.7
   and 66.7 g/l MLSS, respectively. Concentrations of COD, ammonium and
   phosphate ions were decreased in sludge water. The average nitrate
   consumption for bioflotation was 21.2 mg NO3- per 1 g of MLSS of
   activated sludge. Flotation time ranged from 4 to 48 h.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of a filter bed is fully described by equations of
   continuity and kinetics.  The form of the continuity equation as
   proposed by Iwasaki has been the subject of further studies and
   modifications.  To date several attempts have been made to solve the
   modified continuity equation (also known as the exact equation) and the
   kinetic equation.  While dealing with the inadequacies and
   inconsistencies of the existing methods and appreciating the
   difficulties associated with the analytical solutions of the exact
   continuity equation, Horner et al. offered a perturbation solution which
   is valid only for smaller values of time.  In view of the need for a
   simple and reliable method of solution, the present study has been
   undertaken in which a computer aided, iterative method has been
   developed to solve the exact continuity equation under all times and
   operating conditions of the filter run.}},

Abstract = {{The u.v. absorbance is measured in water samples, collected on six
   successive cruises made within 1 year, from two Saudi sewage-affected
   fjord-like lagoons in Jeddah (Arbaeen and Reayat Al-Shabab).  The
   hydrochemical elements, salinity, phosphate and ammonia are also
   measured.  The horizontal and vertical distribution pattern of u.v.
   absorbance and that for the other hydrochemical elements are found to
   coincide with each other to a great extent.  The direction of the
   discharged wastewater spread at the surface can be easily identified. 
   Three distinct water layers are observed.  The surface layer is diluted
   by sewage effluent containing high values of u.v. absorbance, phosphate
   and ammonia.  The intermediary layer has almost the same properties as
   the water outside the lagoon mouth at the same level where it is less
   diluted (i.e. less polluted).  The third layer at the bottom (old water)
   where the water is dammed by the sills is more saline.  It has
   exceptionally high values out of the four elements studied.  This
   situation prevails almost throughout the year except during the
   intermittent flushing periods in winter and early spring, when the
   stratification is disturbed.  The advantage of using u.v. absorbance
   measurement is that it can be read directly in the water samples without
   any chemical pre-treatment and so no special training is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Columns of raw and retorted oil shale from the Kerosene Ck seam of the
   Rundle deposit were leached with dilute H2SO4 to simulate, on an
   accelerated time scale, the potential effects of acidification in this
   system.  A parallel set of control columns was leached with distilled
   water only so that the extent of natural in situ generation of acidity
   by the shale materials could be determined.  The results from the
   controls confirmed that the raw shale has a positive acidification
   potential.
   Thermodynamic computer modelling supported the proposal that dissolution
   of calcite and siderite dominate the titration curve for the raw shale. 
   There was good agreement between the observed and predicted elution
   profiles for Ca2+, HCO3- and Fe2+.  However, the behaviour of Mn2+ was
   not able to be satisfactorily modelled by the simple sequential batch
   titration approach that was used.  It is proposed that the much earlier
   than predicted breakthrough of Mn2+ occurred as a result of hysteresis
   in the solubility of MnCO3, coupled with accelerated elution caused by
   competition with Ca2+ for ion exchange sites in the shale matrix and
   depletion of available binding sites as the acid front advanced down the
   column.}},

   considered a significant contributor to distribution system corrosion
   where year-round water temperatures remain near zero degrees Celsius.
   Initial evidence indicates that a heterogeneous population of
   potentially corrosive microorganisms were present in untreated supply
   water, treated water and corrosion tubercles. This included
   sulfite-reducing bacteria (Clostridium species), sulfate-reducers;
   iron-reducing bacteria (Bacillus species, Clostridium sp., Escherichia
   coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepecia, Pseudomonas fluorescens),
   sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (Thiobacillus thiooxidans, Thiobacillus
   thioparus), iron-precipitating bacteria (Leptothrix, Gallionella,
   Sphaerotilus), sulfate-reducing actinomycetes and iron-reducing fungi
   (Penicillium, Rhizopus, Aspergillus). Corrosion tubercles contained
   greater numbers of coliforms than did the untreated supply or treated
   water. The ability of corrosion tubercles to sustain a diverse
   population of direct and opportunistic pathogens, able to participate in
   the corrosion process, may be an unrealized vector in the transmission
   of certain waterborne disease to potential risk groups. In addition,
   corrosion tubercles may serve as a habitat for certain taste and
   odor-producing actinomycetes and fungi in treated water supplies. The
   ecology of these microorganisms, their influence on the corrosion
   process and the potential health impact needs to be investigated
   further.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of chromium, cadmium, lead, copper, zinc and nickel on
   volatile fatty acid (VFA) degradation in anaerobic digestion were
   studied by using serum bottle assays.  Acetic acid acclimated seed
   sludge (AASS) and mixed acids acclimated seed sludge (MASS) were used. 
   The relative toxicity of heavy metals to degradation of acetic acid
   (HAc), propionic acid (HPr), and n-butyric acid (n-HBu) was Cd > Cu > Cr
   > Zn > Pb > Ni, Cd > Cu > is approximately equal to Zn is approximately
   equal to Cr > Pb > Ni, and Cd > Cu > Cr > Zn > Pb > Ni, respectively. 
   Cd and Cu were the most and Pb and Ni were the least toxic heavy metals
   to VFA-degrading organisms.  To some heavy metals, VFA-degrading
   acetogens were more sensitive than HAc-utilizing methanogens.  The
   sensitivity of the VFA degradation to the metallic inhibition was HPr >
   HAc is approximately equal to HBu for Cr, HAc > HPr is approximately
   equal to HBu for Cd and Pb, HPr > HAc > HBu for Zn, HAc is approximately
   equal to HPr is approximately equal to HBu for Cu, and HAc > HPr > HBu

Abstract = {{This report presents a co-relationship method that is used to evaluate
   changes in water quality.  The co-relationship based on the water
   quality in the Goto river basin, is defined as plots of concentration of
   dissolved matter against total residue on evaporation, the correlation
   coefficient and the regression equation.  SiO2 and COD concentrations in
   the water samples of the Goto river basin show a peculiar change that is
   independent of the total residue on evaporation and flow length, and
   this change is again found by means of the co-relationship.  The
   peculiar change of SiO2 is also observed in some rivers in Japan.  The
   correlation coefficient of the total residue on evaporation and SiO2 is
   about 0.2-0.6 in the Goto river basin and in some other rivers in Japan,
   and the intercept of the regression equation of SiO2 and Cl- is apt to
   show a plus value in SiO2 but a minus value in Cl- in most of the
   co-relationships.  The plus value of the intercept and the gentle slope
   of SiO2 show that SiO2 concentration is independent from that of the
   total residue on evaporation, and the minus value of Cl- shows that a
   certain value of total residue on evaporation corresponds to zero
   concentration of Cl-, which means Cl- does not dissolve out from the
   soil colloid.  Thus, the present report suggests that there is a
   peculiar behavior in some species in the water flow by means of the
   co-relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive rural industry is developing rapidly in parts of inland
   Australia.  Also, coastal cities are investigating the use of sewage for
   crop growth, to avoid expensive treatment processes and pollution of
   rivers, streams and oceans.  However, in the past, land spreading of
   manure and liquid effluent has sometimes degraded surface and
   groundwater quality irreversibly.  Many surface waters are particularly
   vulnerable to phosphorus enrichment while some groundwaters are already
   heavily polluted with nitrates.  Salt must be managed carefully to avoid
   degradation of soil fertility and structure in the longer term.  Root
   zone accumulation of salt must be avoided by redistribution and storage
   in the landscape or by dilution in peak flows.  The question is whether
   the nutient and water resources in effluents can be effectively and
   economically captured, so that water resources will be adequately
   protected from the cumulative effect of many small additions.}},

   increases appreciably with the sludge volume index (SVI).  These
   investigations provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved

Abstract = {{In this work chemical fractionation and P-31-NMR spectroscopy were
   employed to explore certain unique characteristics of activated sludge
   exhibiting enhanced phosphorus removal. Two sequencing batch reactors
   were used in this research. The two reactors have been maintained in an
   environmental chamber and operated under the same conditions for well
   over 3 years. The only difference between the reactor systems is one
   system receives a portion of its organic carbon in the dissolved form as
   glucose (D-reactor) while the second reactor (P-reactor) receives an
   equivalent amount of organic material in the particulate form as starch.
   Chemical fractionation data and P-31-NMR analysis indicate that in the
   D-reactor, during periods of enhanced P-removal, transient phosphate is
   stored primarily as high molecular weight polyphosphates and nucleic
   acids. A portion of the transient polyphosphate is located outside the
   cytoplasmic membrane and is cell bound. No polyphosphate was found to
   exist in the mobile form in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, similar
   analysis on sludge taken from the P-reactor, during periods of enhanced
   P-removal, indicate that transient phosphate is stored primarily as low
   molecular weight polyphosphate. The transient polyphosphate is located
   inside the cytoplasmic membrane. A portion of the polyphosphate is cell
   bound while the remainder exists in the mobile form in the cytoplasm.
   Kinetic analysis suggests the possibility of a chemical intermediate(s)
   being formed in the degradation of polyphosphate to orthophosphate in
   sludge from the D-reactor while in sludge from the P-reactor the
   degradation process appears to proceed directly from polyphosphate to
   orthophosphate.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metals can be recovered from wastewaters by growing crystals of
   metal carbonate in a fluidized-bed reactor.  Optimal conditions for
   crystallizing silver carbonate have been investigated on a laboratory
   scale pellet reactor initially seeded with quartz sand.  With an
   effluent-pH of 10.2, a C(T)/Ag feeding ratio of 3 mol/mol, an Ag-load of
   less than 2 kg Ag per square meter reactor cross-section per hour and a
   hydraulic load of 45 m/h, the effluent silver concentration was below 8
   mg/l.  From chemical analysis it was found that the pellets, apart from
   the sand fraction, consisted (for more than 99\%) of pure Ag2CO3.  It
   can be concluded that the crystallization technique is a valuable
   alternative for the classical methods of silver recovery from

Abstract = {{The effect of sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride alone as well as in
   combination on sludge protein solubilization was investigated.  Sodium
   hydroxide treatment was found superior as a maximum protein
   solubilization (90\%) was obtained by its use at pH 12.5.  For the
   extraction of protein hydrochloric acid, sodium lignosulphonate,
   sulphuric acid, acetic acid and ammonium sulphate, as protein
   precipitating agents, were also tried.  Of all the precipitants used
   ammonium sulphate (40\%) was found most effective giving a maximum
   protein recovery (91\%).
   Four parameters were mainly studied for the characterization of
   recovered protein.  These include determination of total protein,
   moisture, ash and heavy metals.  It was also found that protein recovery
   unit processes removed most of the metals originally present in the
   primary sludge and the recovered product contained all the essential
   amino acids which could serve as an animal feed supplement.}},

   decreases the negative electrical charge of the bentonite particles and

   of an original method for measuring BDOC is proposed.  This method is
   suitable for discrete samples and for measuring the biodegradability of
   organic compounds dissolved in water.  It consists of a dynamic
   procedure that measures the decrease in the dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) in the sample of water.  The sample is recirculated through a
   glass column containing a biofilm attached to a novel support medium. 
   The method has been used to study waters at different steps in a

Abstract = {{Competitive inhibition of trichloroethylene (TCE) removal by a mixed
   methanotrophic consortia was minimized by using a two stage bioreactor
   system supplied with sodium formate as reducing equivalents.  A maximum
   TCE removal rate of 21.1 mg TCE per g volatile solids per day was
   observed when the influent formate concentration was 20 mM during
   continuous methane addition.  Termination of methane while maintaining
   the same formate loading resulted in a TCE removal rate of 25.5 mg TCE
   per g volatile solids per day suggesting that methane competitively
   inhibits TCE removal.  Formate serves as a noncompetitive substrate for
   methane monooxygenase system which is responsible for TCE removal.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of p-nitrophenol with ozone in water has been studied.
   The influence of pH and ozone partial pressure on p-nitrophenol
   conversion has been observed. The kinetic regime of ozone absorption has
   been shown to be highly dependent on both variables. Thus, at pH 2 the
   kinetic regime corresponds to a slow reaction regardless of the ozone
   partial pressure applied. At pH 6.5 the absorption of ozone develops in
   the fast kinetic regime the reaction being of pseudo first-order with
   respect to ozone at ozone partial pressures lower than 500 Pa. Finally,
   at higher pH (8.5 and 12.4) and ozone partial pressures higher than 2000
   Pa, the reaction becomes instantaneous. Under conditions of slow and
   instantaneous kinetic regimes the liquid phase volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient, k(L)a, was calculated. The results are in agreement with
   those obtained from the absorption of ozone in organic-free water at
   similar pHs. On the other hand, under the situation of fast pseudo
   first-order reaction the rate constant for the p-nitrophenol-ozone
   direct reaction was determined to be 4.5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1. The ozone
   decomposition reaction develops to some extent only at pH 12.4.}},

   lowest, 1.4 mm/yr. It is concluded that water and nutrients provided by
   sewage are important factors for microbial corrosion. Two corroded
   products were mainly produced, depending on pH levels. Gypsum was formed
   at pH levels less than 3 on the surface of the concrete sewer pipe and

Abstract = {{During a survey conducted from January 1988 to December 1989, enteric
   virus levels in river water ranged from 13 to 192 plaque forming units

   in winter (Jan. to Mar.) and summer (Jun. to Aug.). Isolation of
   polioviruses coincided with the administration of polio vaccine.
   Coxsackie group B viruses, particularly type 4, were isolated over a
   long period in 1988 and 1989. Echoviruses and adenoviruses were isolated
   throughout the year, though in small numbers. Reoviruses were isolated
   most frequently throughout the year. Among the five cell lines used in
   virus isolation, HEp-2 cells were the most sensitive to polioviruses,
   coxsackie group B viruses and adenoviruses. RD-18S and Vero cells were
   useful for isolation of echoviruses and reoviruses, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Size fractionation methods have been used for the speciation of trace
   elements in several urban streams. Both filtration and ultrafiltration
   techniques were applied to separate the trace elements into various
   sizes and/or molecular weight ranges. The size distribution was
   determined for 39 elements by means of neutron activation analysis to
   estimate their chemical or physical forms.
   It was clarified that alkali and alkaline-earth elements, halogens and
   V, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn, As, Se, Mo, Sb, W, U etc., in the urban streams were
   mainly present in the dissolved phase, and that Sc, Fe, Ag, Al, Hf, Ta,
   Au and light rare-earth elements were predominantly associated with the
   suspended particles. The following conclusions could be drawn on the
   dissolved species of trace elements in the urban streams: (1) the
   dominant dissolved species for alkali and alkaline-earth elements, V,
   Mn, Al, Sb and Au are regarded as simple inorganic ions; (2) the
   elements Sc, Cr, Co, Ni, Zn, Se, Mo, W, Ir, U and heavy rare-earth
   elements tend to form soluble complexes with organic or inorganic
   ligands; (3) arsenic is divided between both species of simple inorganic
   ions and soluble complexes; and (4) the elements Fe, Ag, Ta and light
   rare-earth elements are mainly associated with organic or inorganic
   colloids.}},

Abstract = {{Primary particles in rivers are frequently and perhaps
   characteristically transported as larger flocculated particles.
   Typically floc size has been determined by destructive, indirect
   laboratory methods or by laborious microscopic measurements.
   A unique direct observation digitizing method of floc characteristic
   analysis was developed and applied to suspended solids from Sixteen-Mile
   Creek in Southern Ontario. Suspended sediment particles in the creek are
   strongly flocculated, and the flocs are relatively stable within the
   realms of the sampling and analytical method.
   The digitizing method allowed for direct observation of floc structures
   which is impossible with conventional methods of sediment sizing. The
   method provides reasonable results with good precision on floc
   equivalent spherical diameter, surface area, perimeter and circularity.
   It is limited, however, by its labour intensive nature, possibility of
   sediment overlap, the individual investigator's criteria and by the
   photographic and microscopic instruments and techniques used. Other
   sizing techniques, or the use of the digitizing method by other
   investigators, may produce different results.}},

Abstract = {{In situ biotreatment of contaminated soil and groundwater requires the
   provision of optimal conditions for biodegradation in the subsurface.
   The supply of inorganic nutrient solutions and oxygen in the form of
   dilute H2O2 was investigated using a number of soils in order to
   determine limitations of injection and infiltration technologies. It was
   found that migration of phosphate was limited by the precipitation of
   insoluble salts and that this reduced soil permeability. Sodium
   tripolyphosphate was found to reduce partially the amount of
   precipitation but disrupted soil structure. The addition of inorganic
   nitrogen to an oil-contaminated soil was found to inhibit mineralization
   of glucose and phenanthrene. The use of H2O2 as an oxygen source at
   concentrations above approx. 100 mg H2O2 l-1 was restricted by
   decomposition reactions. Precipitation of oxidation products and bubble
   formation owing to degassing resulted in significant reductions in soil
   permeability. Sodium tripolyphosphate also reduced chemically-catalysed
   cleavage of H2O2 but extensive biologically-mediated breakdown still
   occurred. The results demonstrate that significant difficulties may be
   encountered when using inorganic nutrient and H2O2 solutions for site
   bioremediation but the effects are site-specific. Detailed assessments
   of individual sites are a necessary pre-requisite to any in situ
   biotreatment programme.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption/partition of several organic solute (contaminants) of a wide
   range of hydrophobicities was studied on clay and on clay-humic
   complexes representing aquifer-soil systems. The role of the mineral and
   of the organic (humic) fractions was elucidated and a model considering
   both fractions in the sorption process was proposed. The adsorption
   constants on humic (organic fraction), K(oc), were 8-20 times higher
   than on ``pure{''} clay, K(m). But with soils with low to medium organic
   fractions (f(oc) < 0.05) the contribution of the clay mineral to
   adsorption was quite significant, in spite of the fact that half of the
   sorption sites on the mineral surface were blocked by the humic. In the
   range of very low organic content in aquifer soil a non-linear pattern
   going through a minimum is observed between the overall partition
   coefficient and soil-organic fraction, transforming to the familiar
   linear relationship at higher f(oc)s. Both the K(oc) and K(m) followed
   the linear-free energy relationship to the octanol-water partition
   coefficient K(ow).}},

Abstract = {{Breakdown mechanisms and flow characteristics involved in a peat bed
   treating oil-in-water emulsions have not yet been understood fully. This
   paper examines the applicability of the well-known Carman-Kozeny
   filtration equation to a 1000 mm peat bed treating a standard mineral
   oil-in-water emulsion at six different flow rates. The specific
   permeability coefficient, the Carman-Kozeny constant and the shape
   factor of peat were found to be 5.3 x 10(-11) m2, 3.4 and 2.2,
   respectively.
   Assuming the impaction-interception mechanism to predominate, the
   overall coalescence efficiency of the peat bed was evaluated. The
   effects of flow rates and depths of peat bed on coalescence efficiency
   were analyzed. Contrary to the general trends observed by other
   investigators, coalescence efficiency decreased with an increase in bed
   depth (from 14\% at 200 mm depths to 3\% at 1000 mm depth) indicating
   possible simultaneous occurrence of filtration and coalescence in the
   peat bed.}},

Abstract = {{The standard method for measuring chemical oxygen demand (COD), which is
   widely used throughout environmental engineering is affected by a number
   of inorganic substances. These are outlined in Standard Methods (APHA,
   Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 16th
   edition. Washington, D.C., 1985) and methods of overcoming the problems
   are given, however, no reference is made to hydrogen peroxide as an
   interfering substance. In a number of complex industrial wastewaters,
   H2O2 is present and is also used in its treatment which will thus
   interfere with the analysis. This interference has a positive error
   effected on COD. This work has been carried out in order to show how
   hydrogen peroxide interferes in COD analysis, and further shows how to
   allow for this interference in future COD analysis. A number of specific
   points have been raised. It has been shown that H2O2 forms a complex
   with potassium dichromate, the structure of which is given. In
   experiments which were made on a range of synthetic samples, it was
   noted that the samples containing H2O2 had different COD values for
   various concentrations although they contained no organic substances.
   Also, it was shown on industrial wastewater samples that H2O2 either
   increased the COD values of the wastewater samples or interfered with
   the procedure, by completely masking the titration end-point. Reference
   is made to those industries and processes which contribute to
   interference by H2O2. A method of calculating the effect of interference
   by H2O2 is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1974 sewage sludge has been dumped in the Firth of Clyde at a
   position 6 km south of Garroch Head point on the Isle of Bute. The water
   currents in this area allow sludge solids to settle on the sea bed,
   resulting in the accumulation of trace metal contaminants in the
   sediments at the disposal site. The present study was carried out to
   investigate the degree to which the dumped metal contaminants are
   retained within the sediments. The quantity of trace metals in the
   sludge dumped at the site since 1974, calculated from historical
   records, was compared with the quantity of trace metal in the sediment
   which could be ascribed to the sludge disposal. This comparative study
   showed that 36-38\% of the copper and mercury and 18-20\% of the
   cadmium, lead and zinc from the sludge could be accounted for by
   elevations in trace metal concentrations in the sediments. The
   sensitivity of these estimates to uncertainties in the values of the
   various parameters of the calculations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The mineralization of C-14-labeled linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS),
   stearyltrimethylammonium chloride (STAC) and linear alcohol ethoxylate
   (LAE) was examined in the anaerobic sediments of a laundromat wastewater
   pond and a pristine control pond. The microbial communities in sediments
   of the wastewater pond had been exposed to high levels of surfactants
   for over 25 years. Mineralization was determined by measuring the
   evolution of (CO2)-C-14 and (CH4)-C-14 from the C-14-test substances.
   {[}C-14]Glucose and {[}C-14]benzoic acid served as positive controls.
   LAS and STAC were not mineralized in sediments from either pond; LAE,
   glucose and benzoic acid were mineralized in both ponds. LAE
   mineralization was most rapid in sediment from the margin of the
   wastewater pond, while glucose and benzoic acid mineralization was most
   rapid in the control pond. With sediment from the center of the
   wastewater pond, mineralization of LAE, glucose and benzoic acid was
   preceded by a substantial lag. An experiment with specific metabolic
   inhibitors suggested that both methanogenic and sulfate reducing
   bacteria may play a role in LAE mineralization. In summary, this work
   demonstrates that LAE degrades anaerobically in sediments and indicates
   that extended acclimation does not relieve the need for molecular oxygen
   in LAS and STAC mineralization.}},

Abstract = {{A planktonic, gas-vacuolate Oscillatoria species was isolated from
   catfish ponds in Mississippi during an episode of off-flavor and high
   2-methylisoborneol (MIB) levels. Volatile compounds from unialgal

   extraction, and analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy.
   The organism produced MIB at 75-87-mu-g l-1 after 2-3 wk of incubation
   at 25-degrees-C. The alga was found in moderate to high numbers in three
   pond water samples with high MIB levels, and low numbers in two other
   samples with low MIB levels. The organism was not present (less than one
   organism/10 ml) in nine other samples characterized by a ``woody{''} or
   ``swampy{''} odor and no detectable MIB. This Oscillatoria strain is
   believed to be the first blue-green alga that produces MIB ever isolated

Abstract = {{In Grosser Arbersee, a cirque lake in the Bavarian Forest (Germany), the
   acidification chronology since the late-glacial period has been studied
   paleolimnologically, applying subfossil diatom assemblages. Distinct
   phases of acidification could be detected, both natural ones by
   post-glacial development of soils and vegetation in the catchment and
   anthropogenic ones by mineral acid depositions. Whereas the first phases
   were accompanied (and most probably caused as well) by increases in
   organic carbon contents, the recent phases are characterized by losses
   of organic carbon contents in the lake.
   In various sensitive lakes in Central Europe the fate of organic carbon
   (measured as loss on ignition) is documented for the anthropogenic
   acidification period. In lowland as well as in high alpine lakes this
   process is accompanied by loss of organic carbon. These losses are by no
   means uniform. On the contrary, they range between 10 and 90\% per drop
   of one pH-unit, in each lake calculated from estimated preacidification
   pH-conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption capacities and rates of seven principal chlorinated
   organic compounds for six commercial GACs were investigated. All the
   adsorption isotherms were expressed by the Freundlich equation, and the
   isotherms for the chloroethylenes such as trans-1,2-dichloroethylene,
   trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene could be shown by the modified
   Freundlich equation Q'= k' (C/C(s))l/n for each GAC. The magnitude of
   adsorption of the chlorinated organic compounds was in the order of:
   tetrachloroethylene > trichloroethylene > trans-1,2-dichloroethylene >
   1,1-dichloroethane > carbontetrachloride > 1,1,1 -trichloroethane >
   chloroform. The value of k for a certain GAC could be predicted from the
   quantity of pores smaller than 2 nm in diameter. The adsorbed amounts
   were decreased by 10-20\% when humic substances coexisted. The working
   periods of a fixed bed adsorber before regeneration were predicted by
   calculating breakthrough curves for various influent concentrations of
   trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene at the space velocities of 5
   or 10 h-1, and it was certified that the adsorption method by GAC was
   feasible for removing these compounds from water.}},

Abstract = {{A study over the evolution of aluminium concentrations (total, filtered
   through 0.45-mu-m membranes and suspended Al) in two Spanish reservoirs
   has been carried out. The results obtained indicate that there are depth
   trends in concentrations of Al: the bigger Al levels have been found in
   deeper waters. During the rain periods, the suspended Al associated with
   silicate clays in the fresh water inputs penetrates in the reservoirs;
   an experimental relation between suspended Al concentrations and
   turbidity of natural waters is proved. After rain, the sedimentation
   phenomena cause decrease in suspended Al levels, whereas the level of
   filtered Al (majority dissolved Al) varies very little. A relation
   between the total Al concentration and pH can be observed in all the
   sampled periods (March-July 1990): the lower the pH values, the bigger
   the Al levels. Finally, in reservoirs under strong anaerobic conditions
   during their thermal stratification periods. the variations in Al are
   similar to those already known for iron and manganese.}},

Abstract = {{A bench-scale experiment was conducted in a 70 1. tank of tap water to
   examine the effect of four design variables on oxygen transfer in a fine
   pore diffused aeration system. The experiment used non-steady state gas
   transfer methodology to examine the effect of air flow rate, air flow
   rate per diffuser, orifice diameter and reduced tank surface area on the
   overall oxygen transfer coefficient (K(L)a20 h-1); standard oxygen
   transfer rate (OT(s), g O2 h-1); energy efficiency (E(p), g O2 kWh-1)
   and oxygen transfer efficiency (E(o), \%). The experiments demonstrated
   that K(L)a20 and OT(s) increased with air flow rate (9.4-18.8 1 min-1)
   in the 40 and 140-mu diameter orifice range; however, E(p) and E0 were
   not affected. Reducing the air flow rate per fine pore diffuser (40 and
   140-mu-diameter pore size) significantly increased K(L)a20, OT(s), E(p)
   and E(o). A decrease in orifice diameter from 140 to 40-mu had no effect
   on K(L)a20, OT(s), E(p) an E0. A reduction in tank surface area had a
   marginally significant inverse effect on K(L)a20 and OT(s), and no
   effect on E(p) and E(o). The mean bubble size produced by the 40 and
   140-mu diffusers was 4.0 and 4.2 mm, respectively. There was no
   consistent effect of air flow rate on bubble size within the range of
   air flow rates used in this experiment. In clean water aeration
   applications, the optimum system efficiency will be obtained using the
   largest number of fine pore diffusers operated at low air flow rates per
   diffuser. In wastewater treatment plants, higher air flow rates per
   diffuser should be used to prevent diffuser biofouling and keep
   biological solids in suspension. Wastewater systems are purposely
   operated at less than optimum transfer efficiencies in exchange for
   reduced diffuser maintenance and improved mixing. In either situation,
   changes in tank surface area and diffuser pore size (provided that pore
   diameter remains between 40 and 140-mu) are unlikely to have any
   significant effect on aeration system efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Field studies have shown that benthic metabolism accounts for over 90\%
   of oxygen uptake in the Tarawera, a shallow mobile-bed river receiving
   treated pulp mill effluent. The deoxygenation and BOD exertion rates are
   both spatially uniform over a 20 km reach below the main outfall which
   appears to contradict the well established principles of ``self
   purification{''}. The intrinsic oxygen uptake rate of the sediment
   (measured in stirred bottles) decreases with distance below the outfall
   as expected. Oxygen diffusion into the bed confines metabolic activity
   to a surface ``active layer{''} whose thickness increases from 5 to 15
   cm with distance below the outfall. This combination when corrected for
   decreasing river depth results in a spatially uniform deoxygenation
   rate. Current river dissolved oxygen models assume first-order kinetics
   for most of the deoxygenation although many also include a zero-order
   sediment oxygen demand term. This study shows that in shallow rivers
   where benthic metabolism is important zero-order kinetics may dominate
   as a result of diffusion limitations at the bed.}},

Abstract = {{Benthic metabolism accounts for over 90\% of oxygen uptake in the
   Tarawera, a mobile-bed river receiving treated pulp mill effluent. A
   steady-state DO model was developed in 1984 which uses zero-order
   kinetics for benthic metabolism. During calibration a strong linear
   relationship was identified between the river deoxygenation rate
   (benthic oxygen uptake rate) and the river BOD concentration just below
   the main outfall. When tested against non-steady monitoring data the
   model successfully predicted monthly-average DO concentrations but
   tended to ``overshoot{''} when waste loads varied. This suggests that
   the mobile-bed communities have some ability to attenuate the effects of
   varying waste loads. A post-audit of the model using recent monitoring
   data shows that the model can predict day-to-day variations of DO under
   average waste loading conditions but not when there are sudden large
   changes of waste load. It can be inferred that there are two different
   time scales operating: surface microbial communities respond quickly
   (1-2 days) to variations in waste load, but following a major reduction
   in waste load, reworking of deeper sediments depresses river DO for
   several weeks. There is a need to develop ``biofilm{''} type models of
   mobile-bed rivers in order to refine predictions of DO under non-steady
   waste loadings.}},

Abstract = {{These experiments were performed to determine the degradation of VFA
   (acetate, propionate and butyrate) and the maximum methanogenic activity
   of granular sludge from the thermophilic anaerobic digestion of pure
   molasses. The compositions of acetate, propionate and butyrate used as
   substrate were 25:35:40. The tests were performed at constant
   temperature (55-degrees-C) and pH 7 on two duplicate batch reactors (I
   and II) running in parallel and were repeated to show the effect of
   acclimatization. During the first feeding, there was a significant lag
   phase and after about 23 h incubation the volumes of CH4 gases produced
   from two reactors were only about 20 and 490 ml, respectively. In this
   experiment, propionate was converted to acetate only after the initial
   concentrations of butyrate and acetate had completely degraded. Acetate
   formed from propionate was immediately converted to methane and carbon
   dioxide. The maximum methanogenic activities of the first feeding were
   not high because the natural populations of the propionate-degrading
   bacteria were low and the sludge adapted itself to the VFAs' substrate
   very slowly. In a second experiment with the same sludge, the maximum
   methanogenic activities of the second feedings were about 1.60 times
   higher than those of the first feedings because of the adaptation of the
   sludge and increase of populations of the propionate-degrading bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{The solubilities of 54 chemicals were measured in octanol, triolein and

   between 4 and 20-degrees-C. Values of solubility in water and
   octanol/water partition coefficient (K(ow)) for these chemicals were
   compiled from the literature to examine their relationships with
   solubility in the three solvents. Regression analyses indicated highly
   significant relationships between (1) the chemicals' solubility in water
   and the three solvents, (2) solubility in water and K(ow), (3)
   solubility in other solvents and K(ow), and (4) solubility ratio of
   solvent/water and K(ow). Relationships 2-4 tend to be less well defined
   with increasing K(ow), this response may be attributed to K(ow), values
   that were derived by extrapolation or calculation. Further analyses
   between log solubility ratios and log K(ow), values up to 5.0, indicate
   a linear relationship where the regression coefficient was not
   significantly different from 1.0, and a regression intercept that
   included zero. This response would suggest K(ow), could be calculated
   from the solubility ratios of chemicals that are not miscible in

Abstract = {{This publication presents the results obtained from observations on the
   daily cycles in the River Seine, downstream from the water purification
   plant at Acheres. Most of these observations concern six stations spread
   over 59 km. They were made in 1989 at three different times of the year
   (summer, autumn and winter) for periods lasting from 1 to 24 h according
   to the stations and the parameters studied: light, temperature, pH,
   dissolved oxygen, conductivity, chlorophylls, pheopigments, chlorides,
   bicarbonates, as well as different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus.
   Regarding conductivity and the concentrations of certain nutrients, an
   undeniable link was found between their daily rhythms and those of the
   flows from the Acheres sewage plant. In the absence of heavy rainfall,
   simple continuous measurements of conductivity along the river are
   sufficient to follow these flows and study their longitudinal dispersion
   as they moved downstream. The origin of the daily cycles of dissolved
   oxygen and chlorophyll are more complex. In June and October, they are
   mainly linked to light, the concentration of chlorophyll being moreover
   very closely related to temperature. In December on the other hand, the
   situation alters completely (minimum light, important fall in
   temperature, low chlorophyll concentrations). A daily cycle persists for
   dissolved oxygen but has nothing to do with light, being entirely
   subject to the discharges from the Acheres sewage plant.}},

   of these polyaromatic nitrogen compounds. Fulvic acid inhibited the

   the decomposition of ozone by OH- and OOH-, scavenging of the hydroxyl

   selective oxidation of aniline by carbonate radicals.}},

Abstract = {{A vertical profiling system was developed to continuously measure and
   simultaneously log temperature, salinity, depth, fluorescence and
   selected nutrient concentrations (NO3-, NH4+, SiO44- and (PO43-) in the
   euphotic zone in coastal waters. A hose was attached to a CTD sensor and
   lowered through the water at 1 m min-1. Water was pumped to the ship's
   deck with a diaphragm pump, and passed through a fluorometer and
   Technicon Auto Analyzer(R) to measure fluorescence and selected
   nutrients, respectively. A 25 m vertical profile takes about 30 min to
   complete. These instruments were connected to an analog-to-digital
   converter, and the data were stored and plotted using an IBM personal
   computer to simultaneously display real-time vertical profiles of
   temperature, salinity, fluorescence and several nutrient concentrations.
   This instrument package is invaluable because it provides real-time data
   that are essential for choosing discrete sampling depths, and for
   obtaining a time series of the vertical structure of the euphotic zone
   of dynamic coastal waters or lakes.}},

   concentration of either acid from low levels reduced the rate of its
   utilization and that increasing the acetic acid concentration from 1000
   to 2000 mg l-1 significantly inhibited degradation of propionic acid
   added at 500 mg l-1. Good agreement was obtained from fitting the
   logistic equation to the measured data and between duplicate runs
   performed within the experiments. The observed inhibition of propionate
   degradation by acetate confirms several earlier reports of product
   inhibition in the literature and emphasizes the importance of
   controlling acid levels in maintaining satisfactory digester operation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the compositional characteristics of wastewater from
   a low temperature carbonization (LTC), plant manufacturing domestic
   coke, generating tar and light oil. Wastewater characteristics from this
   plant show the presence of a variety of pollutants like phenols,
   ammonia, cyanide, sulphide and thiocyanate in appreciable concentration
   owing to the absence of byproduct recovery operations. Under suitable
   conditions, biological treatment of LTC wastewater in a two stage
   activated sludge process (ASP) mainly results in good removal of BOD
   (95\%) and COD (78\%). Concentrations of different phenols and their
   fate in these treatment units show that the phenols except pyrogallol
   can be removed efficiently. Ammonia cannot be stabilized to nitrite or
   nitrate even after maintaining a high sludge retention time (SRT) in the
   bioreactors. Cyanide removal in these units is very poor.
   Microbiological status of these units reveals that most of the active
   biomass is comprised of phenol-utilizing organisms. The system constants
   for biological unit operations for ASP, like oxygenation capacity of LTC
   wastewater (a = 0.50 and b = 0.36) and biokinetic constants (Y = 0.13,
   k(d) = 0.12 d-1, mu-max = 0.59 d-1 and k(s) = 88.25 mg l-1), have been
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Exploitation of the metabolic capabilities of specialized microorganisms
   requires availability of specific process control methods.  The
   specialists must be enabled to compete favorably in multi-species
   microbial systems.  Bench scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR)
   experiments were conducted to study the effectiveness of selected
   process strategies with respect to maintenance of the degradative
   capabilities of added microorganisms.  3-Chlorobenzoate (3-CB) was
   applied as a model substance for chloroorganic pollutants, mixed with
   sodium acetate and peptone as model substances for readily biodegradable
   pollutants.  Pseudomonas putida PRS 2015 pAC 27 served as a model
   specialist.  The bacteria were added to activated sludge from a
   municipal wastewater treatment plant.  The SBRs were operated at a fast
   fill strategy (0.5 h), frequent cycle; repetition (8 h cycle time) and a
   volumetric exchange ratio of 20\%.  On the long run, no significant
   differences between the supplemented and non-supplemented system was
   observed.  In comparison with the reactor which was not bio-supplemented
   the start-up period was significantly reduced, however, and the special
   metabolic capabilities remained resident, even when 3-CB was not fed
   over several days (up to 7 days).}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of male-specific RNA (FRNA) coliphages, proposed as
   indicators of enteric viruses, was determined in an estuary subject to
   nonpoint pollution that included fecal inputs from livestock.  A host
   originally developed for detecting FRNA phages in sewage was applied to
   water and sediment samples.  Phages were enumerated using the host
   Salmonella typhimurium WG49 containing an Escherichia coli plasmid
   coding for sex pili, and the female parent strain WG45.
   FRNA phages and fecal coliforms were enumerated in samples collected
   seasonally from an estuary and associated feeder streams and densities
   related to selected environmental parameters.  Mean phage densities
   enumerated on WG49 ranged from < 1 to 50 100 ml-1 water and < 13 to 7200
   100 g-1 dry sediment.  Examination of 300 phages from estuarine and
   freshwater samples showed that greater-than-or-equal-to 99\% were
   RNase-resistant, greater-than-or-equal-to 94\% were lytic to the female
   parent salmonella strain (WG45), less-than-or-equal-to 9\% were lytic to
   male E. coli C3000, and none were lytic to female E. coli C.  RNase
   resistant phages lytic to both salmonella strains were noncontractile
   flexible tailed phages and those lytic to male salmonella or E. coli
   hosts were filamentous phages.  Electron micrographs of the only
   RNase-sensitive phage recovered that plaqued only male hosts showed
   cubic phage particles adsorbed to sex pili.
   Parallel enumerations of environmental samples on WG45 and WG49 yielded
   equal or greater phage densities on the former host.  Purified phages
   from these samples were lytic to certain salmonella serovars recovered
   from the environment but did not cross react with fecal coliform or
   heterotrophic bacteria isolated from the environment.  Although the WG49
   host was inappropriate to estuarine and freshwater samples examined
   because of interference by somatic phages, WG45 and WG49 should be
   examined as hosts for enumerating salmonella phages.  Similarly, the
   public health significance of somatic phages detected by these hosts
   should be determined.
   FRNA phages, with a single exception (1/187 samples), were not detected
   in a condemned shellfish growing area subject to nonpoint pollution. 
   This observation questions the application of FRNA phages as indicators
   of fecal contamination in waters impacted by diffuse fecal inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Cladophora glomerata is a filamentous green alga dominant in many large
   rivers of Montana, U.S.A.  I studied several factors which may be
   associated with nuisance (> 100 mg m-2 chl a, Welch et al.,
   Hydrobiologia 157, 161-168, 1988) C. glomerata biomass:  temperature,
   pH, conductivity, NH4+, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), NO3-, flow
   and epiphyte load.  Samples were collected at 6 sites, ranging from an
   irrigation ditch to large rivers.  Low flow, high NH4+ and low epiphyte
   loads were all correlated (P < 0.05) with high biomass.  The negative
   correlation between flow and biomass was related to low biomass observed
   during early summer and autumn runoff events, and a peak biomass which
   occurred during summer low flow.  Positive correlations of C. glomerata
   with NH4+ were influenced by data from a site receiving secondary sewage
   effluent.  Nevertheless, biomass greater than 100 mg m-2 chl a was
   observed in other sites with 90\% lower nutrient levels.  These data
   indicate that it may be difficult to significantly lower biomass of the
   common weedy alga C. glomerata in rivers similar to those sampled in
   this study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a simple and powerful procedure for the specimen
   preparation of aquatic colloidal particles prior to direct observation
   by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Four preparation schemes are
   described.  For waters containing sufficiently large concentrations of
   colloids, aqueous solutions of particles are mixed with Nanoplast, a
   water-soluble embedding resin, and centrifuged over specimen grids
   placed on a horizontal disc; after curing, the resulting film has
   optimum quality for studies of particles at ultra-high resolution
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 1 nm).  For waters with low concentrations of
   colloids, or when size fraction is desired, particles are collected
   directly on a TEM grid placed at the bottom of a centrifugation tube;
   after deposition and curing of a film of Nanoplast over the specimen,
   the grid can be used directly for TEM observation.  The advantages of
   these methods, and of two other applications of Nanoplast for aquatic
   and sediment particles, are compared to those of classical specimen
   preparation schemes.  A large number of specimens may be quickly
   prepared in the field, using the above procedures; at the same time,
   most of the preparation artefacts linked to classical procedures are
   avoided.  The new procedures should help to make TEM a semi-routine
   analysis method for studying the nature and behaviour of aquatic
   colloids.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the reaction between ozone and aqueous solutions of
   4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) has been investigated from
   gas absorption experiments in a semi-continuous reactor.  They were
   conducted modifying the gas flow rate, agitation speed, ozone partial
   pressure, initial pesticide concentration, temperature and pH.  The
   liquid mass transfer coefficient, the interfacial area and the
   stoichiometric ratio between ozone and MCPA were evaluated.  A model
   based on the film theory was used to analyse the experimental data and
   to determine the rate constant and the kinetic regime.  The results
   obtained support a second order overall reaction, the rate constants
   being well correlated by the expression:  k = 9377 exp(-3276/RT)

   carried out over a 6 month period in a pilot plant of the modified
   Ludzack-Ettinger configuration.  The feasibility of the biological
   nitrogen removal from this type of wastewaters without a preliminary
   chemical-physical phase or an external carbon source for denitrification
   was proved.  The COD utilization coefficient was 12.5 mg COD for 1 mg of
   denitrified N.  No inhibition of the process was induced by Cr or by S2-
   present in the raw wastewaters.  A negative effect on the
   denitrification rate resulted from a high ratio between the quantity of
   oxygen returned with the mixed liquor and the inlet COD.}},

   streams:  the River Borovniscica polluted with organic substances
   (municipal and industrial wastewaters) and the River Bistra polluted
   with inorganic nutrients.  In both cases benthos was found more
   important in comparison with overlying water for consumption and

Title = {{PROTON COMPETITION IN CU(II) ADSORPTION BY FUNGAL MYCELIA}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1365-1375}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Fungal mycelia have been shown to be effective adsorbents for the
   removal of heavy metals from dilute solutions.  Copper ions and protons
   become adsorbed to the fungal surface through reaction with specific
   surface sites including amino-, phosphate, carboxyl- or hydroxo-groups. 
   In this study, an alkalimetric/metal titration technique was used to
   evaluate the competitive adsorption between protons and Cu(II) ions onto
   acid-washed mycelia of Aspergillus oryzae and Rhizopus oryzae.  A
   general macroscopic mechanism has been established to describe the
   specific adsorption of both protons and Cu(II) ions.  Using a simple
   graphic or a non-linear least squares technique, the adsorption
   parameters; i.e. adsorption constant and maximum adsorption capacity,
   were evaluated.  The results predicted by the two-site model with a
   double reciprocal plot or the Scatchard plot were compared by non-linear
   regression.  In the presence of multiple classes of sites, better fit of
   the experimental data was obtained by treating the fungal surface as one
   which possesses two major functional groups, namely:  (1) high affinity
   of monodentate binding, (2) low affinity of bidentate binding.  Because
   hydrogen ions compete significantly with Cu(II) ions for adsorption
   sites, the competitive Langmuir isotherm so derived was characterized by
   three parameters:  two-site Cu(II) affinity, two-site Cu(II) adsorption
   density and apparent proton affinity.  This enabled differentiation of
   the Cu(II) adsorption from protons.  Two intrinsic equilibrium constants
   for Cu(II) surface complexation were estimated.  With this information,
   it was possible to predict the adsorption of Cu(II) over a wide range of
   metal loading conditions at various pH values.}},

   intervals of 1.0 h (IAP-1.0) or 3.5 h (IAP-3.5).  When the units were
   high in MLSS concentrations, high removal efficiencies (89.0-99.5\%) for
   BOD and TOC were attained with both IAP and NLAP in all runs.  While,
   large differences in the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus between IAP
   and NLAP were observed; at influent N/BOD5 of 0.18, removal efficiencies
   for total nitrogen in IAP-1.0 and NLAP were 96.9 and 58.6\%, and for
   total phosphorus were 80.8 and 47.8\%, respectively.  However, those
   removal efficiencies decreased with the increase in the N/BOD5 ratio of
   wastewater charged.  Removal efficiencies for total nitrogen in IAP-1.0
   was 72.2\%, even at influent N/BOD5 of 0.45.  Thus, high removal
   efficiencies for organic substances, nitrogen and phosphorus in swine
   wastewater were simultaneously obtained by IAPs.  By adopting an
   adequate aeration program for individual swine wastewater treatment,
   this system will provide a promising means for nitrogen and phosphorus
   control without pH control, divided change of wastewater or addition of
   methanol.}},

Abstract = {{An open-face, plastic-sheet reactor design was tested to determine
   wastewater flow characteristics in cross-flow plastic media trickling
   filters.  Flow characteristics were evaluated by routine visual
   inspection of the open-face reactor during its 40-day operating period
   and by 35-mm time lapse photography and video tape recording of impulse
   tracer dye applications.  The experimental observations showed that the
   bulk of the trickling filter flow can be characterized as a vertical
   laminar liquid film flow over a majority of the biofilm surface that is
   interrupted at regular intervals by falling liquid drops, originating
   from irregularities or protrusions in the biofilm surface.  A small
   portion of flow occurs by falling droplets and flow in 50-100-mm length,
   dispersed shallow channels.  The liquid film appears to be mixed at the
   falling droplet impact location.  The distance between these mixing
   locations, referred to as an uninterrupted flow path length, is
   determined by the location of biofilm surface protrusions.  Although
   many biofilm surface protrusions are located near the nodes or crossing
   points of adjacent sheets of the media's surface, they are also found at
   other locations.  Thus, it is not possible to specify the uninterrupted
   flow path distance from media geometry features alone.  In addition,
   observed flow irregularities resulted in intermittent wetting of some
   biofilm surfaces with intermittent exposure directly to the reactor gas
   phase.  This condition may have a significant effect on oxygen mass
   transfer rates to the biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{Stable biological foams are a worrying problem for the operation and
   control of activated sludge plants.  The flotation of a fraction of the
   sludge is related to the metabolism of certain filamentous
   micro-organisms which synthetize and/or excrete hydrophobic compounds. 
   In France, a survey of 6000 activated sludge plants has shown that 20\%
   of them (87\% of these plants which operate by extended aeration) are
   affected by this problem.  Microscopic observations performed on samples
   collected in 58 selected plants have shown that, among the filamentous
   germs identified, the most frequent is Microthrix parvicella (45\% of
   cases), followed by type 0675 (26\% of cases) and the Nocardioform
   actinomycetes (14\% of cases).  Identification criteria for all these
   germs are documented.  The investigation reveals the difficulties
   encountered by plant operators to control foaming phenomenon.  So far,
   promising results have been obtained either by using the contact zone
   technique or resorting to chlorination.}},

Abstract = {{Dye studies were conducted on a run-of-the-river impoundment to observe
   longitudinal dispersion in a lacustrine/riverine environment.  Field
   data were analyzed in the context of a streamtube model which accounts
   for dispersion by the lateral distribution of longitudinal velocity. 
   The differential advection associated with the vertical distribution of
   longitudinal velocity {[}i.e. Elder's equation (D(x) = alpha-xu{*}h)] is
   incorporated in this stream-tube model providing longitudinal dispersion
   within each tube.  Model calibration attempts required alpha values on
   the order of 100, greatly in excess values expected from fluvial
   experience.
   A diffusive stall was observed twice when the dye plume moved into a
   sudden expansion of channel width.  The stall is predicted by Fischer's
   K(x) equation.  The stream-tube model reasonably reproduced the field
   data in a variety of initial-period conditions, caused by the highly
   variable geometry of Coralville Reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental data describing microbially mediated transport and
   transformation processes for two pesticides are presented.  A mixed
   culture of microorganisms maintained in a minimal basal salts media
   supplemented with a single, low energy carbon source provided inoculum
   for a series of small, aerobic batch reactors containing varying
   concentrations of either lindane or 2,4-D.  Controls were simultaneously
   established to monitor microbial performance without pesticides as well
   as any non-biological pesticide removals.  Data were collected daily
   enumerating pesticide and primary substrate removal, bacterial numbers,
   pH and dissolved oxygen.  Rate constants, assumed to be first order in
   form were calculated for pertinent substrate and microbial population
   properties.  Lindane removal initially consisted of
   adsorption-desorption from the microbial biomass followed by
   decomposition, which began as the primary substrate concentration
   decreased to detection levels.  2,4-D removal did not include
   significant adsorption and proceeded with the removal of the primary
   substrate.  Complex interactions exist between low energy, non-toxic
   primary substrates, high energy-increasingly toxic secondary materials,
   and the microbial populations involved in transport and transformation
   of the pesticides.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradabilities of surfactants in four detergents namely SDS, Teepol,
   Apollo, Spencer and Triton X-100, and two shampoos, Flex and Rainbow,
   were assessed using the river-water die-away method.  The shampoos
   underwent a more rapid primary biodegradation than the liquid
   detergents.  The ease of degradation over a 12-day period followed the
   order-SDS (97\%), Rainbow (85\%), Flex (79\%), Spencer (79\%), Apollo
   (77\%), Triton X-100 (63\%) and Teepol (59\%) and appears to be related
   to their sulphate concentrations.  A microbial consortium comprising the
   following genera-Vibrio, Flavobacterium, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas,
   Enterobacter, Bacillus, Escherichia, Shigella, Citobacter, Proteus and
   Anaebena-were found to effect the degradation.  The detergents and
   shampoos supported microbial growth in the following decreasing order;
   Teepol, Spencer, Flex, Rainbow, Apollo and Triton X-100.  It is
   concluded that the detergent or shampoo that supports the most microbial
   growth is not necessarily the most easily degraded.}},

Abstract = {{To effectively control and maintain microalgal species in an aquaculture
   pond is necessary because microalgae play an important role in
   stabilizing pond water quality via either ammonia uptake or oxygen
   production.  In this study, microalgae taken from a tilapia rearing pond
   were cultured, under various temperatures and ammonia-N concentrations,
   by using both continuous-flow and batch reactors.  The succession of
   dominant microalgal species was examined.  The dominant microalgae
   species in batch reactors are Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus
   ellipsoideus, S. dimorphus and Westella botryoides under the conditions
   of dilution rate, 0.25 day-1; temperature, ranging from 17 to
   32-degrees-C; ammonia-N concentration, less than 15 mg/l and light
   intensity, 4000 lux.  The dominant species found in batch reactors are
   more stable than those found in continuous-flow reactors.  Low
   concentrations of both ammonia-N and microalgae are desirable for
   obtaining a better control of dissolved oxygen level in an aquaculture
   pond.}},

Abstract = {{Literature about the treatment of wastewater from an ``ossein plant{''}
   is not available.  An attempt has been made to present the quantum of
   wastewater generated along with its characteristics in various sections
   of the ``ossein plant{''}.  A treatability study has also been conducted
   using lime at various pH levels varying from pH 7 to 9 which results in
   effluent quality in terms of COD (304-364 mg/l), chloride (2488-2764
   mg/l) and phosphate (7.9-35.7 mg/l).  Further bench-scale
   biodegradability tests were conducted on neutralized and settled
   wastewater using batch and continuous activated sludge aeration systems
   resulting in COD reduction of about 87\% in a 16 h aeration period. 
   Based on bench-scale treatability studies, a full-scale treatment plant
   has been in operation for the past 3 years with an effluent COD level of
   40 mg/l and suspended solids of less than 100 mg/l.  The treatment
   scheme suggested in this paper involves the application of chemical and

   disappearance of solute in each case approximately obeys first order
   kinetics with the apparent first order decay constant increasing with
   decreasing solute concentration.  Flow rate data, total organic carbon
   analyses and the effect of hydrogen peroxide are also given.  The marked
   dependence of degradation rates on flow rates indicated a substantial
   mass transfer limitation but the rates were much greater in the
   photocatalytic system than for the natural u.v. degradation rates.  The
   geometric arrangement lends itself to scaling up of the process in
   continuous operation without major engineering cost.  Times for removal
   of 50\% of solute for 15 1. of each solution of initial concentration
   10-mu-M at a flow rate of 13.8 1/min per m2 of sunlight at the equinox

Abstract = {{Calcium, copper, nickel and zinc were examined for their effect on the
   growth of axenic filamentous bacteria which included strains of
   Thiothrix, type 021N and type 1701.  All organisms grew best at the
   upper range of calcium concentrations tested.  Heavy metals were also
   less toxic to Thiothrix strain A1 at higher calcium concentrations. 
   Copper was more inhibitory than either nickel or zinc and copper-nickel
   and copper-zinc mixtures appeared to act synergistically in suppressing
   the development of Thiothrix strain A1.  In contrast, nickel toxicity
   could be reduced by the addition of zinc to the medium.  Metal toxicity
   could also be diminished by the chelating agent, EDTA; therefore, free
   metal ions were most likely responsible for the observed toxic effects. 
   A computer model, MINEQL, was used to predict metal speciation and to
   determine the potential for various media components to control
   speciation of the metals.  The suitability of the computer model was
   determined by comparison of predicted and analyzed free metal ion
   concentrations.}},

   (131 and 136-mu-g Cu g-1 wet wt) in those on a mixture of 1000-mu-g Cu +
   200-mu-g Ni g-1 wet wt, or in the control.  Highest Ni concentrations of
   10.3 and 12.1-mu-g Ni g-1 wet wt were recorded in animals fed on a
   mixture of 500-mu-g Cu + 200-mu-g Ni or 1000-mu-g Cu + 200-mu-g Ni g-1
   wet wt, respectively, and lowest (3.2-3.7-mu-g Ni g-1 wet wt) in those
   subjected to remaining treatments, including the control.  In all
   treatments, including the control, 20-94\% of Cu was contained in the
   hepatopancreas, 1-11\% in the abdominal muscles, 2-25\% in the
   alimentary canal, 2-29\% in the gills and 2-32\% in the exoskeleton,
   while 6-37\% Ni was present in the hepatopancreas, 2-18\% in the
   abdominal muscles, 12-52\% in the alimentary canal, 17-48\% in the gills
   and 11-31\% in the exoskeleton.  The significance of these findings is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During the disposal of sewage sludge to the marine environment, chemical
   changes may alter the mobility of trace elements, thus affecting their
   potential toxicity and availability to marine organisms.  Primary sludge
   from the Ringsend treatment plant in Dublin receives both domestic waste
   and trade wastes which contain heavy metals, and approx. 250,000 tons
   per annum is periodically dumped in Dublin Bay.  The purpose of this
   study was to determine changes which may occur in the chemical
   partitioning of heavy metals in the sludge during disposal.  Samples of
   sludge were collected from the treatment plant in July 1987.  Sequential
   chemical extraction of heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cd, Zn, Fe, Mn) was carried
   out in a nitrogen-filled glove box using 1 M ammonium acetate, 1 M
   sodium acetate, 0.1 M hydroxylamine HCl (pH 2), 0.2 M ammonium oxalate
   (pH 3), 30\% hydrogen peroxide and concentrated HNO3. 
   Seawater-extractable metal was determined by mixing subsamples of sludge
   with filtered seawater from Dublin Bay for 2 h.  Chemical partitioning
   of heavy metals among solid phases in the sludge residue was
   redetermined by sequential chemical extraction.  Both sludge and
   dumpsite sediments were analysed for total heavy metal content and
   organic content.  The sludge was found to be only slightly anaerobic
   with a water content of 88\% and significant concentrations of some
   metals, notably copper and zinc.  Most of the non-residual copper, lead
   and cadmium was found in the organic/sulphidic fraction of the sludge
   (hydrogen peroxide extract), while the dominant phase for zinc was the
   moderately reducible fraction (ammonium oxalate extract) and only iron
   and managanese had substantial proportions of metal in more labile
   phases.  Agitation with seawater mobilized cadmium and manganese to a
   significant extent (56 and 43\%, respectively) but negligible amounts of
   copper or lead (0 and 2\%, respectively).  However, significant changes
   in solid-phase partitioning of lead and zinc occurred resulting in
   mobilization from strongly-bound to more labile fractions.  No
   deleterious effects were found at the dumpsite but localized effects are
   possibly due to the increased mobility of zinc, lead and particularly
   cadmium.}},

   The solution was buffered with KH2PO4-Na2HPO4 at pH = 6.9.  The
   destruction rates were proportional to the dissolved ozone concentration
   and the u.v. intensity in the reactor.  The u.v. irradiation of 8 W m-2
   at 253.7 nm enhanced the destruction rate of the organochlorine
   compounds by more than ten times that of the ozonation without u.v.
   irradiation.  The activtion energy for the decomposition of
   1,1,1-trichloroethane decreased with increasing u.v. intensity.  No
   volatile organochlorine compounds were newly formed in these reactions.}},

Abstract = {{A model is presented for one-dimensional transport of phosphorus (P) in
   soils and groundwater.  Convective transport, hydrodynamic dispersion
   and time-dependent phosphorus sorption are accounted for in the model
   formulation.  Time-dependent sorption of soil-P is considered to follow
   the two consecutive reaction model of Barrow and Shaw (J. Soil Sci. 30,
   67-76, 1979) which has been extensively tested against experimental data
   and can be described by S = k.C(n)t(m).  The assumed sorption model
   allows parameters to be obtained by independent batch and column
   experiments.  A numerical technique is used to solve the solute
   transport equation incorporating a correction to numerical dispersion to
   improve the numerical solution.  An analytical solution for a simplified
   case is also presented to test the numerical technique.  Parameter
   sensitivity analysis shows that influent concentration and the parameter
   k strongly affect the initial breakthrough time of solute, with m and n
   affecting the shape of the breakthrough curve.  Preliminary
   investigations show that the applicability of the model to describe
   column experimental breakthrough curves is promising.}},

   can be used as prediction models.  In this paper, system identification
   techniques, based on the analysis of the input and output of the
   activated sludge system are applied to the modeling of the phenomenon. 
   Specifically, stochastic models and artificial neural system models are
   identified using treatment plant data.  The models are subsequently
   applied to predict the occurrence of future bulking episodes. 
   Comparison of the results obtained by these two methods with other
   prediction techniques is also presented.  These modeling techniques
   yield very accurate results that surpass other traditional prediction
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model has been developed to predict the migration of organic
   contaminants in the subsurface.  The formulations take a multiphase
   approach in describing the flow of organic contaminants in saturated and
   unsaturated porous media.  In a three-phase fluid system of contaminant,
   gas, and water, simultaneous flow of water and the contaminant phases is
   formulated by applying mass conservation principles to each of the
   phases under the condition of no interphase mass exchange.  For each
   phase, the formulations incorporate the spatial variability of the
   relative permeability and its direction dependency.  The complex
   formulations are solved numerically using an implicit finite difference
   scheme.  The accuracy of the numerical model is determined against
   experimental data from the literature.  The predicted migration pattern
   in both homogeneous and stratified media agrees well with the
   experimental data.  Numerical simulations illustrate the strong effects
   of the medium permeability and the water distribution profiles on the
   flow pattern and the pressure distribution of the contaminant.}},

Abstract = {{An extrapolation method is presented for the evaluation of the effect of
   toxic compounds on all species in a community from single species tests
   on selected species representing the community.  The method assumes
   log-normal distribution of the toxicity data.  By extrapolation, a lower
   statistical tolerance limit is determined so that one can assert with a
   certain probability that only a certain percentage of all the species in
   the community are influenced.  The method was tested on ecotoxicological
   data for 11 aquatic species, and it has been compared with two existing
   methods when used for a low number of species.  The first implies
   unwarranted assumptions and resulted in considerably higher critical
   concentrations than the present method when used for a low number of
   species.  The second method applies log-logistic confidence limits and
   yielded critical concentrations which were in agreement with the
   presented method.}},

Abstract = {{Using algal-positive phototaxis, the possibility of keeping a high
   density of algae and separating them from water (i.e. solids-liquid
   separation) for removal of nutritive substances was investigated. 
   Euglena gracilis shows positive phototaxis.  Culture medium containing
   the alga in a culture vessel (bioreactor) was transferred to a shaded
   vessel (i.e. photo-clarifier) part of which was exposed to a spotlight. 
   The organisms gathering around the light were returned to the culture
   vessel, and the effluent was taken out from the shaded part and
   discharged out of the system.  Two types of bioreactors having different
   types of photo-clarifiers were employed:  vertical form (Type A) and
   horizontal form (Type B).  Densities of E. gracilis in the culture
   vessel and effluent were examined in both types over the experimental
   period, and compared with a control system without a photo-clarifier. 
   In both types the E. gracilis density in the effluent was lower than
   that in the culture vessel, whereas in the control system the density in
   the effluent was almost identical with that in the culture vessel. 
   Separation efficiency was higher in Type B than in Type A.  The obtained
   results indicate that it is possible to achieve solids-liquid separation
   by using algal phototaxis, and suggest a possibility of further
   improvement in the separation efficiency by modifying the structure of
   the photo-clarifier.}},

Abstract = {{In a mesocosm study of dispersed-oil effects on cold seawater natural
   phytoplankton, two methods were compared for assessing algal
   photosynthesis. The radiocarbon (C-14) uptake method seemed to be
   affected by elevated heterotrophic activity caused by a bacterial
   increase a few days after oil addition and by the presence of small
   dispersed oil droplets retained on the filters. These artefacts are
   thought to be the cause of an apparent stimulation of the specific
   photosynthetic rate (P/B, or photosynthetic rate per unit algal biomass)
   following oil contamination, although actual photosynthetic rates
   declined in all cases after contamination. Such artefacts did not affect
   the DCMU-fluorescence response, showing a decrease in photosynthetic
   ability that followed the decline in chlorophyll a concentration and was
   very sensitive, whatever the initial algal biomass. The latter technique
   thus seems more appropriate for assessment of deleterious effects on
   phytoplankton photosynthesis, especially in oligotrophic environments.
   Addition of dispersed crude oil at concentrations of the order of 10 mg
   l-1 in April and 4 mg l-1 in December resulted in a decline in
   phytoplankton biomass and photosynthetic ability. Progressive dilution
   of the contaminated environment helped recovery from toxic effects after
   1 week.}},

Abstract = {{On Italy's Adriatic coast there are a large number of aerobic sewage
   treatment plants, the majority of which do not feature high-efficiency
   tertiary treatment processes.  In order to investigate the relationship
   between these plants and the trophic potential of the water they
   discharge, we constructed a pilot plant capable of reproducing the
   sewage treatment process with four different levels of purification on a
   rising scale of efficiency in terms of the best-known macronutrients
   (nitrogen and phosphorus).  Water samples taken at various points on the
   plant for each of the four operating modes underwent laboratory
   assessment to establish their trophic potential in relation to a
   dinoflagellate alga (Prorocentum micans).  We were thus able to
   demonstrate that after biological treatment alone the sewage water has a
   high eutrophication effect; this gradually decreases as the nutrients
   are removed and virtually disappears when the plant is providing maximum
   removal at full efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic model of the clarification-thickening process is presented. 
   Based on the solids flux concept and on a mass balance around each layer
   of a one-dimensional settler, this model can simulate the solids profile
   throughout the settling column, including the underflow and effluent
   suspended solids concentrations under steady-state and dynamic
   conditions.  The model makes use of a special settling velocity equation
   designed to simulate the settling velocity of dilute and more
   concentrated suspensions.
   The model can be applied to both primary and secondary settlers to
   simulate dynamic and steady-state conditions.  Examples based on
   full-scale and pilot-scale experimental data taken from the literature
   serve to illustrate the application of the model to secondary settlers. 
   Results of the analysis confirm that the model can serve to predict the
   effluent and underflow suspended solids concentrations under a variety

Abstract = {{Fifty samples of water, comprising sewage-polluted river water and
   artificially-contaminated spring water, were analyzed in order to
   compare the P-A test and the conventional membrane filter and multiple
   tube methods for the detection of total and fecal coliforms, fecal
   streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and sulfite
   reducer clostridia.  The two presumptive media proposed for the P-A
   test, the MacConkey broth with tryptone (MacConkey-PA) and the
   lactose-lauryl tryptose-tryptone broth (STM-PA), were also compared. 
   The P-A test using STM-PA medium showed better results than the
   MacConkey-PA when water with lower levels of contamination
   (artificially-contaminated spring water) was analyzed.  For coliform
   detection the P-A test with 48 h of incubation showed better results
   than with an incubation period of 5 days.  For the detection of other
   indicators such as Ps. aeruginosa, sulfite reducer clostridia, and fecal
   streptococci in water with low levels of contamination the incubation
   period should be extended, as very different results after 48 and 120 h
   incubation were obtained with percentages of positivity being
   respectively, for Ps. aeruginosa, 48\%, 76\%; for sulfite reducer
   clostridia, 16\%, 48\%; and, for fecal streptococci 24\%, 92\%.  Similar
   results were obtained for sewage polluted river water.  Staphylococcus
   aureus was not detected by the P-A test.
   The P-A test using the STM-PA medium showed a good performance and is a
   promising tool for the evaluation of bacteriological quality of drinking
   water, especially in tropical climates where the coliform indicator may
   not be adequate.  This test could overcome this problem, allowing the
   use of a multiple indicator approach.}},

Abstract = {{The Johannesburg City Council has operated biological and chemical
   nutrient removal wastewater treatment plants for the past 15-16 years. 
   With the advent of more sophisticated sludge handling techniques,
   problems have been experienced with the recycle of phosphorus-rich
   sludge processing liquors to the liquid phase.  These problems are
   expected to increase in the future.  This paper describes laboratory and
   pilot scale experiments to determine viable methods for phosphorus
   removal from sludge liquors and ways of obviating phosphorus release
   from phosphorus-rich activated sludges.
   The design of new full-scale plants being constructed to pretreat
   phosphorus-rich sludges prior to dewatering are also discussed.  The
   paper also describes innovative process layouts for sludge treatment
   keeping in mind various options for final sludge disposal.  Emphasis is
   placed on the pre-aeration and phosphate precipitation from
   anaerobically digested and raw primary sludges and techniques for the
   thickening and dewatering of primary and waste activated sludges to
   minimize phosphate release into the liquors so produced.  The technique
   of sludge thickening on linear screens is described and the coupling of
   linear screens to belt presses to complete the dewatering operation.}},

Abstract = {{A mechanical device for sediment resuspension has been used in Venice
   Lagoon for sampling extremely thin surface sediment layers, allowing the
   characterization of the top few tenths or hundredths of a millimetre. 
   The age of the resuspended layer was estimated at two sampling stations
   from the sedimentation rate to be about 2 weeks.  Zinc and iron were
   determined (nitric acid extraction) in particles of the resuspended
   layers and in the corresponding underlying sediments.  Lower metal
   concentrations were detected in sediments (43-323-mu-g/g for Zn and
   9200-17400-mu-g/g for Fe) with respect to resuspended particles
   (63-424-mu-g/g for Zn and 12,200-25,400-mu-g/g for Fe).  The remarkable
   concentration decreases of zinc (both in resuspended particles and in
   sediments) from the inner areas of the lagoon (Porto Marghera) seaward,
   can be attributed to the decreasing effects of industrial pollution. 
   The relatively high concentrations of iron observed in areas far from
   Porto Marghera, can be explained by the contribution of runoff waters or
   by contamination from nearby polluted sediments.  Higher metal
   concentrations in resuspended particles were observed in April than in
   February (1987).  Concentration increases for zinc (from 7 to 91\%) were
   more substantial than for iron (from not significant to 42\%).  Zinc
   uptake by plankton, followed by deposition of residual organic materials
   onto the sediment surface is suggested as an explanation of the higher
   metal concentrations detected in April.  These results reflect the
   particular features of the proposed technique, which, at least for
   cohesive and fine grained sediments, seems to be promising for future
   applications in studies both on the tracing of metal pollution sources
   and on the migration processes of these contaminants between sediment
   and overlying water.}},

Abstract = {{Three EPA-approved residual chlorine detection methods were compared
   using standard solutions and water collected from the Savannah River
   which is used to cool reactors at the Savannah River Site (SRS) near
   Aiken, S.C.  The testing was part of an experimental program to develop
   baseline data for the design of a proposed cooling tower for the
   K-reactor at the SRS.  A series of total residual chlorine (TRC)
   measurements made simultaneously by three methods revealed that for the
   river water samples, the DPD method (Hach DR-100 kit) and the
   amperometric titration method produced statistically similar results
   while an ion-selective electrode method, standardized according to the
   manufacturer's instructions, provided significantly lower values.  The
   DPD method (utilizing a Hach DR-100 kit) was the recommended method for
   future monitoring of the water evaluated because this method is simple,
   provides quick results, measures both total residual chlorine (TRC) and
   free residual chlorine (FRC) and is equally suitable for measurements in
   the field and laboratory.}},

   95.6 to 98.5\% of total DOC was rejected by the membrane, though only
   70\% could actually be recovered, most likely because of losses within
   the plumbing system.  Comparison of the acid-base characteristics of the
   original water sample with re-diluted concentrate show that
   modifications occurred.  Visual evidence showed that polycondensation
   reactions which modify acid-base characteristics occurred in the
   concentrate.  Analysis of the material passing through the membrane
   (permeate) shows that it is < 200 Da in weight with a pK(a) distribution
   suggesting that a range of molecules with carboxylic and phenolic acid
   sites are leaking through the membrane.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the first phase of a project designed to determine
   the potential of peats in extracting hydrocarbons from groundwater. 
   Peat samples with markedly different compositions were slurried under
   controlled conditions in either saturated solutions or emulsions of
   benzene, toluene, or m-xylene.  All peats were characterized in order to
   determine the possible correlation between various parameters and
   extraction capacities.  All peats were found to be capable of extracting
   substantial amounts of either free-phase or dissolved hydrocarbons from
   water.  Free-phase extraction ranged from 30 to 50\% of the starting wet
   volume of the peats.  Solution extraction produced reductions in
   concentrations of between 53 and 97\%, depending on the peat type.  In
   solution, toluene was found to be more slowly adsorbed than either
   benzene or m-xylene.  In general, the best hydrocarbon adsorption from
   solution can be achieved by using peats that are low in fiber and
   birefringent organics and high in ash and guaiacyl lignin pyrolysis
   products.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid assays for Escherichia coli have been developed by using the
   fluorogenic compound 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucouronide (MUG),
   which is hydrolysed by glucuronidase to yield a fluorescent product that
   is visible under long-wave u.v. light (Feng and Hartman, 1982; Alvarez,
   1984; Koburger and Miller, 1985; Rippey et al., 1987).  MUG was
   incorporated into a Al-broth (Andrews and Presnell, 1972) at a final
   concentration of 100 mg/l.  To each well of a sterile 96-well
   microtitration plate, 100-mu-l of Al-MUG medium was added.  The plate
   was then air dried, covered with a sterile tape and stored at
   4-degrees-C.  To enumerate E. coli using the miniaturized multi-tube MPN
   procedure, 200-mu-l of diluted or undiluted water was added to each well
   of a microtiter plate.  The number of rows inoculated with each dilution
   depended on the presumptive contamination level of the samples (Table
   1).
   The plate was incubated for 18 h at 44.5-degrees-C and observed in the
   dark for fluorescence by using a long wave (366 nm) u.v. light source. 
   Raw surface water, wastewater effluents, human and animal faeces were
   collected for the specificity studies.  Fluorescent positive wells were
   then confirmed for the presence of E. coli by transfer to Schubert broth
   and incubation at 44.5-degrees-C for 24 h.  Strains cultivable at
   44.5-degrees-C, with gas and indole production were considered as E.
   coli.  In addition, gas or indole negative strains were identified using
   API 20E strips.}},

Abstract = {{Responses of lake bacteria, protozoans, and chlorophyll a, to two
   applications of sulfuric acid were observed in lake enclosure
   experiments.  Acid was applied all at once (pulsed addition) or
   gradually over a 2 week period (gradual addition) to decrease pH to 3.5.
   These experiments were carried out simultaneously in a dark-dystrophic
   lake and a clear-oligotrophic lake on the Katherine Ordway Preserve,
   near Gainesville, Fla.
   Pulsed acid addition in the clear lake caused bacterial densities and
   biomass to increase, and bacterial growth to decrease.  This indicated
   decreased grazing of bacteria by protozoans and/or zooplankton.  Gradual
   addition caused some positive effects on bacterial biomass and metabolic
   processes indicating changes to more acid tolerant bacteria.  Bacteria
   did not have time to adapt in the pulsed acid addition, while they did
   in the gradual acid addition.  Acid additions had no significant effects
   on protozoan densities or chlorophyll a.
   Acid additions did not significantly affect bacterial densities or
   biomass in the dark lake.  Glucose assimilation and glucose
   mineralization were significantly higher on day 6, while only glucose
   assimilation was higher on day 12 in the pulsed addition.  Pulsed acid
   addition caused a decline in protozoans and chlorophyll a.  Gradual acid
   addition caused increased protozoan densities and decreased chlorophyll
   a.  Either the bacteria were better adapted to acid conditions or the
   dark lake chemistry buffered them against the effects of acidification.}},

Abstract = {{This study defined major factors influencing the survival of the
   bacterial indicators, fecal coliforms (FC) and fecal streptococci (FS),
   in separate storm drain sediments during dry weather periods.  FC and FS
   abilities to survive were determined by field sampling and experimental
   treatments of laboratory stream models.  The effects of interspecific
   competition, antagonism, and predation on FC and FS survivals were
   determined using recirculating models that contained either untreated
   drain water and sediment, cycloheximide-treated drain sediment, or
   autoclaved drain water and sediment seeded with drain isolates of FC and
   FS.  Storm drain sediment FC and FS counts were stable at 10(5)/100 ml
   during dry weather (4-6 days), with little or no bacterial
   supplementation from the water (10(1)-10(2)/100 ml).  Untreated
   (control) model FC and FS populations stabilized at 10(3)/100 ml for 7-9
   days.  In cycloheximide-treated models, FS and FC survived at 10(4) and
   10(5)/100 ml, respectively.  In autoclaved-seeded models, FS and FC
   initial counts of 10(4)/100 ml increased to and stabilized at
   10(7)-10(9)/100 ml.  Separate storm drain sediments serve as reservoirs
   of high concentrations of FC and FS during warm, dry weather periods. 
   FC exhibited some ability to multiply in drain sediment.  Native
   microfloral competition/antagonism (including bacterial predation) and
   protozoan predation are major biotic factors influencing FC and FS
   survivals.  During warm, dry weather periods, abiotic factors were
   generally stable and had minimal affects on FC and FS survivals.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to securing low nitrate supplies is to take advantage of the
   bacterially mediated process of denitrification.  This paper reviews the
   factors controlling denitrification and describes the evidence for
   denitrification in the groundwater environment.  It is found that
   natural denitrification, although not extensive, does occur in a variety
   of aquifers where there is a sufficient source of oxidizable organic
   carbon.  However, natural processes cannot be expected to remove the
   large quantity of nitrate now present in many aquifers.  Water treatment
   processes that stimulate artificial denitrification by the injection of
   the required nutrients are under development, and may offer a simple and
   inexpensive method of nitrate removal.  This paper reviews the various
   above-ground and underground techniques to determine the advantages and
   disadvantages of this approach compared with other nitrate removal
   technology.  It is concluded that artificial denitrification as an
   above-ground process affords the best nitrate removal rates and process
   control.  Compared with alternative technology, namely ion exchange,
   above-ground biological treatment does not generate large quantities of
   waste product, but is more difficult to automate.  Underground processes
   have been developed, but their long-term success will depend on
   restricting blocking of the aquifer matrix with accumulated biological
   matter.}},

Abstract = {{The upflow anoxic fixed film-fixed bed (FFFB) reactors have been shown
   to be an effective system for the continuous long-term biodegradation of
   resorcinol, catechol and phenol in mono- and binary substrate systems. 
   Degradation with nitrate as electron acceptor shows that molecular
   oxygen is not required for the catabolism of these compounds under
   anoxic condition.  Cross feeding studies conduced in the acclimated
   reactors revealed that the nitrate-dependent resorcinol degradation
   pathway may be different from that of the reductive phenol pathway
   common for most of the substituted benzenes as the phenol pathway is
   poorly expressed in the resorcinol-acclimated column.  Catechol is
   poorly utilized in the phenol-acclimated column; utilization rate was
   improved when resorcinol or phenol was added as co-substrate.  Phenol
   and catechol, in binary mixed feed, negatively interacted with one
   another's metabolism in the resorcinol-acclimated reactor; the
   interaction being more conspicuous at higher substrate loading rates. 
   Catechol-and phenol-acclimated columns demonstrated good substrate
   utilization efficiencies when binary mixed feeds were fed to these
   columns.  The data suggest that substrate utilization pattern in mono-
   and multi-substrate matrices is guided by the type of the substrate
   initially used to acclimate the three reactors employed for this
   investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation processes are used to treat contaminated soil, aquifer
   material, sludges and residues.  The success of such treatment processes
   lies in:  (a) degrading the organic contaminants and (b) reducing both
   the toxicity and the migration potential of the hazardous constituents. 
   Laboratory studies were conducted using phenolic compounds to
   characterize overall chemical degradation and toxicity reduction in a
   contaminated soil, solid phase bioremediation process.  The results
   indicated that:  (a) first-order kinetics satisfactorily fit the loss of
   phenolic compounds and the decrease in toxicity that occurred, (b)
   contaminant loss in the water soluble fraction (WSF) was faster than
   loss of the same chemicals in the soil, (c) the toxicity of the WSF
   decreased as the soil chemical and WSF chemical concentrations decreased
   and (d) no enhanced mobilization of the applied chemicals resulted as
   the degradation and detoxification occurred.  Results indicated that
   detoxification as well as chemical loss occur in soil bioremediation
   processes and suggest that by-products of the degradation and chemical
   loss mechanisms do not increase the toxicity of the water soluble
   fraction from such processes.}},

Abstract = {{Pollution of public water is monitored mainly by chemical and physical
   assays.  Moreover, it is evaluated by microbiological assay of coliform
   group bacteria.  For a determination of the number of coliform group
   bacteria as the biological indicator, the most probable number (MPN)
   test is generally used.  The MPN test is also used to monitor the
   bacterial contamination of foodstuff.  As for the procedure, a test
   sample is added to Brilliant green-Lactose-Bile broth and the presence
   or absence of gas production is observed; it is judged by the presence
   of gas in an inverted vial (Durham fermentation tube).  In routine work,
   numerous fermentation tubes are used for the multiple-tube fermentation
   test.  Aiming at the development of a disposable and low cost substitute
   for the fermentation tube, we prepared and examined synthetic polymers
   for the detection of gas production.  In conclusion, one type of the
   foamed synthetic polymers of polyurethane UFX-22 was found to be the
   most suitable and the results using this type were comparable to those
   obtained by the Durham fermentation tube method.}},

Abstract = {{High-turbidity waters, containing up to a few percent of suspended
   solids, occur quite widely and present considerable treatment problems,
   especially because of low sedimentation rates.  Such waters are normally
   treated by sedimentation and the rate can be greatly increased by the
   use of polymeric flocculants.  The degree of flocculation achieved and
   the improvement in settling rate can be markedly affected by the dosing
   and mixing conditions.  These effects have been studied with stirred
   clay suspensions, using a simple, flow-through monitor which gives a
   rapid indication of the degree of flocculation.  The same monitor has
   been used to derive sedimentation rates, which show good correlation
   with the flocculation response.  For high solids concentrations and
   relatively low polymer doses, flocculation occurs rapidly, but the flocs
   are not stable and can be broken at moderate stirring rates.  This leads
   to a maximum floc size and a corresponding maximum settling rate soon
   after dosing the suspension with polymer.  This peak is most pronounced
   with the most concentrated suspensions.  By reducing the stirring rate
   after a short period, the flocs can be maintained at their peak size,
   without break-up.  In this way, appreciable flocculation can be achieved
   with much lower polymer dosages (about 100-mu-g/g, based on the weight
   of solids) than are usually reported.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of the polycyclic hydrocarbons (PAH) fluoranthene,

   traverse the largest cities in south-eastern Australia.  The PAH
   quantified ranged from < 0.3 to 525 ng l-1 with the smaller compounds
   most abundant and concentration decreasing with increasing ring number. 
   The method used Freon(R)-113 (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane) for
   rapid on-site extraction of PAH from 40 l. of water.  Measured
   concentrations are extractable PAH, which may indicate the labile PAH
   available for uptake by aquatic organisms.  Results show that aquatic
   organisms were exposed to relatively high extractable concentrations of
   the PAH of low ring number.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial substrates were used to investigate changes in the settlement
   and early development of fouling communities during dredging of Port
   Kembla Harbour, Australia.  A total of 19 fouling species were recorded
   during the study.  Communities that had developed before dredging
   contained almost twice as many species as those whose development took
   place during dredging.  Only two species, a bryozoan and a hydroid, were
   recorded in communities that had developed during both periods. 
   Ascidians, barnacles, serpulids and sponges were most sensitive to the
   increased levels of turbidity produced by the dredging operations.  As a
   consequence the initial development of the fouling communities was found
   to be significantly retarded.  A combination of factors including,
   direct physical removal of larvae, physiological and toxic stress, was
   thought to be responsible for these effects.}},

Abstract = {{The present expansion of water improvement programmes in developing

   supply of drinking water. Quality control measures encounter many
   technical difficulties and are not often performed. A study of the
   microbiological quality of 982 rural water points was undertaken in the
   Sahelian region of Burkina Faso. A mobile laboratory was developed for
   this work. Bacteriological analyses were performed using the membrane
   filtration method and the results measured according to WHO potability
   standards. Surprisingly, results showed a faecal contamination in 7.7\%
   of boreholes. Possible risk factors of pollution were analysed, leading
   to recommendations for technical improvement. The responsibility for
   eliminating these risk factors, in the main, lies with the consumers
   through health education. This study highlights the place of sanitary
   education programmes as a priority among the objectives of health

Title = {{COMPETITIVE EFFECT IN BI-SOLUTE ADSORPTION ONTO ACTIVATED CARBON - DSS,
   ALCOHOLS AND PHENOLS AS SOLUTES}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Many organic toxic compounds in water supplies are resistant to
   conventional treatment.  For low concentrations of organic contaminants,
   activated carbon is a good adsorbent and its use for water supplies has
   been widely studied.  Bath experiments are generally used for the
   prediction of performance such as adsorptive capacity of granular
   activated carbon filters.  To simulate the adsorption process, studies
   have been carried out with alcohols (Abe et al., 1979, 1980; Gaid et
   al., 1983; Belfort, 1979), in a mixture with another organic solute,
   LaFrance et al. (1983), Dusart et al. (1990), Martin and Albahrani
   (1977, 1979) have investigated equilibrium expressions and different
   constants for multisolute adsorption on activated carbon.
   The purpose of this work is to study the adsorption kinetic evolution
   for sodium dodecylsulphate in the presence of n-alcohols (methanol to
   pentanol) and n-dodecanol and to examine the steric hindrance influence
   for the adsorption equilibrium parameters and the external mass transfer
   coefficient K(f) {[}equation (1)].
   Also, aromatic molecules such as phenol and 2-naphthol have been chosen
   to be compared to alcohols in their co-adsorption with the DSS in order
   to have a better knowledge of the surface heterogeneity of the activated
   carbon.  Then, the maximal adsorption capacity GAMMA infinity is
   determined from the Langmuir isotherm equation.  A 3 h contact time is
   required for the obtention of the equilibrium DSS adsorption; this
   stabilization in the rapid phase of the adsorption is more rapidly
   achieved in the presence of a co-adsorbate.  The effect of the alcohols
   studied in the millimolar range:  methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,
   pentanol at equilibrium time is shown in Fig. 1 - the dimensionless
   adsorbed concentration C/C0 is unchanged for methanol and ethanol but
   diminished in the other cases.
   The low solubility of pentanol in water seems to be a limiting factor
   for this study; so that the dodecanol is solubilized in methanol before
   being added to water solutions of DSS.  The micromolar range of
   dodecanol is sufficient to strongly diminish DSS adsorption on activated
   carbon (Fig. 2).  K(f) evolution is of the same order.  The large steric
   hindrance and hydrophobic effects of the chain of dodecanol and its
   equally good adsorbability (Schwuger and Smolka, 1977) give competitive
   phenomena in the co-adsorption of the DSS.  A compact molecule such as
   phenol or 2-naphthol is compared to these results (Figs 3 and 4).  The
   sequence of the added co-adsorbates in the adsorption can modify the
   kinetic external mass transfer coefficient and also the pseudo
   equilibrium parameters are important to obtain the CAG filter
   performance.
   The influence of Ca2+ ions, which are very important for DSS fixation
   onto the negative charged surface of the CAP (Mazet et al., 1988), is
   also studied.  The results of the adsorption of DSS in the presence of
   phenol, naphthol (N-2) are noted on Fig. 3.  No phenol effect on DSS
   appeared.  The N-2 presence somewhat diminishes the adsorption of DSS
   (Fig. 5) and desorbs the DSS when it is added after 3 h adsorption
   contact time (Fig. 6) but, K(f) valiues are not modified (Fig. 7).  Ca2+
   ions give, and maintain good promotion of the adsorption of DSS only if
   simultaneously present with the DSS (Figs 5 and 6).  The complex
   DSS-Ca2+ seems to be necessary to have supplementary sites on the carbon
   surface.
   For N-2 adsorption in the presence of DSS (Figs 8, 9 and 10), an
   inhibition effect can be observed; K(f) is also diminished and if the
   DSS-Ca2+ mixture is first adsorbed, a stronger inhibition of the
   adsorption is noted (K(f) is reduced in the same order).  In this case
   an inhibition effect is obtained which is reflected in the evolution of
   the maximum capacity results (Fig. 11).}},

   continuous flocculator, i.e. a coiled circular pipe, operated
   alternatively with a non-destabilized, a pre-flocculated and a
   flocculent bentonite suspension.  The flocculation energy was found to
   be very low for concentration values below 2 g/l; for higher
   concentrations, it depends on concentration and velocity.  The velocity
   gradient calculated from the flocculation energy is lower than 100 s-1
   and is therefore in the empirically recommended range.  The flocculation
   energy can in most cases be neglected while designing an industrial

   respective developmental stages of a chironomid (Polypedilum nubifer),
   from hatching to emergence, and the oviposition and hatchability of its
   eggs, were assessed using a flowthrough aquarium.  Two egg clusters,
   each composed of c. 500 eggs, were introduced into the aquarium.  The
   start of emergence was delayed from one to several days as the
   concentration of CNP in water or food was raised.  The percentage
   emergence success was 65, 47, 48 and 13\% for control, 30, 60 and
   90-mu-g 1(-1) CNP, respectively.  The oviposition success and the
   hatchability of oviposited eggs decreased to about 50\% of the control
   in midges exposed to 90-mu-g 1(-1) CNP, although there was no
   significant effect at the other concentrations.  Food for the midge
   larvae containing 50, 160 or 560-mu-g CNP g-1 (wet wt) was prepared. 
   The CNP concentration in the food did not decrease more than 30\% of the
   initial concentration for 2 days even in the flowthrough aquaria.  The
   emergence success was 55, 55, 40 and 22\% when the midges consumed the
   control food and food containing 50, 160 and 560-mu-g CNP g-1 (wet wt),
   respectively.  The oviposition success also decreased according to
   increasing CNP concentration of the food.  The hatchability of
   oviposited eggs decreased to 0.19 at the maximum CNP concentration in
   the food, compared with a value of 0.67 for the control food.  It is
   suggested that reproduction of chironomids is impaired by CNP in the

Abstract = {{The possibility of phosphorus removal from wastewater by fixation with
   half-burned dolomite grains was investigated.  The results obtained
   showed the formation of a non-stochiometric calcium phosphate on the
   surface of the grains, undoubtedly of an amorphous nature as structure
   identification could not be made when X-ray diffraction techniques were
   employed.  Identification by ESCA technique indicated a structure having
   a (Ca + Mg)/P ratio of 1.4.  Equilibria experiments carried out at
   25-degrees-C between the solid and a phosphate-containing solution
   showed that the fixation could be modelled following a Freundlich type
   isotherm.  The fixation capacity of grains with a 0.5 mm mean particule
   size was 10 mg PO4-P g-1 solid.  The influences of hydraulic conditions
   and grain specific area on the fixation capacity were investigated. 
   Acid regeneration of the spent material seemed to be of no practical
   interest.  From an engineering point of view, this treatment could serve
   as a tertiary step after biological treatment of a wastewater.  Finely
   pulverized powder (diameter < 100-mu-m) should be directly added at the
   outlet of a poor axial mix aeration basin, in order that the powder
   incorporates into the biological floc which will enhance separation of
   the sludge in the sedimentation tank.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to describe and examine the importance
   of ciliated protozoan communities in the activated-sludge process. 
   During this study a total number of 21 species of ciliates was recorded
   and 19 physico-chemical variables measured in the wastewater.  The
   presence of the most common species of ciliates was related to plant
   operational parameters using multivariate statistical procedures. 
   Principal Component Analysis with Varimax rotation performed on the
   total biological and non-biological set of data showed that six
   component factors explained 73\% of the variability of the process.  The
   first factor has a significant biological importance; it groups together
   the species of ciliates and explains 25\% of the variability of the
   sewage plant.  This study helps to understand the ecology of these
   organisms and the operational and control methods of the
   activated-sludge process.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were carried out on the degradation of phenol by
   mixed cultures grown in a completely-mixed and compartmentalized system
   at various solids retention times. In spite of the fact that both the
   systems produced effluents of the same quality, the superiority of the
   compartmentalized system was definitely proved even for the degradation
   of the toxic compound. Besides the capability of suppressing the
   filamentous microorganisms' growth, the compartmentalized system
   produced a mixed culture which had the maximum volumetric and specific
   rates of phenol removal much higher than that grown in the
   completely-mixed system. Pilot plant experiments were carried out on the
   purification of hospital wastewaters in a completely-mixed and
   compartmentalized contact aeration system used in Japan in small
   treatment plants. As regards filtered effluents, both systems produced
   effluents of the same quality. Non-filtered effluents from the
   compartmentalized system were much better due to lower concentrations of
   suspended solids. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is given.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of wastewater treatment using genetically engineered
   xenobiotic-degrading microorganisms was discussed.  The degradation
   activity and the plasmid stability of some Escherichia coli and
   Pseudomonas putida strains harboring the recombinant plasmids containing
   salicylate oxidase gene or catechol 2,3 oxygenase gene were
   investigated.  A few recombinants showed higher degradation activity
   than those of the wild strains.  On the other hand, the recombinant
   plasmids were unstable in the absence of selective pressure.  Both the
   degradation activity and the plasmid stability were affected
   considerably by the combination of plasmids and recipients.  In another
   experiment, NAH plasmid was transferred into a floc-forming bacteria,
   Pseudomonas lemoignei 551 by conjugation, and floc-forming and
   salicylate-degrading bacteria were bred.  This genetically engineered
   bacteria which grows flocculently seems to be maintained stably in
   activated sludge or in the wastewater treatment process.  From these
   experimental results, the availability of the application of GEMs was
   demonstrated, and the possibility of solving two major problems, the
   genetic stability and the ecological stability, was suggested.}},

Abstract = {{On-line measurement of hydrogen in the biogas of a continuously stirred
   laboratory scale sewage sludge digester was conducted to determine
   whether this variable could provide advanced warning of digester
   failure. Reactor failure was achieved by decreasing the hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) from 20 to 8 days. At the onset of digester failure
   a marked decrease in the volume and methane content of the biogas was
   accompanied by an increase in volatile acid production and a concomitant
   decrease in pH. During this period, hydrogen accumulation in the biogas
   was not evident. An increase in hydrogen was noted, however, well after
   reactor failure had occurred. Hydrogen concentration in the biogas
   cannot, therefore, be used as an indicator of incipient digester
   failure, at least when volumetrically overloaded.}},

Abstract = {{The penetration of coliform bacteria through municipal drinking water
   was studied under normal operating conditions of water treatment plants.
   Samples of filtered water were taken during the 5 h immediately
   following the backwash cycle and analyzed for turbidity and coliform
   bacteria.  Coliforms were enumerated using both m-Endo and m-T7 media to
   evaluate coliform passage and injury.  Elevated turbidity and
   intermittent peaks of coliforms (as high as 60/100 ml) were observed
   during the post backwash period.  Highest numbers of coliforms were
   observed during the flow through time for the interface of the backwash
   remnants and the influent water after backwash.  In addition, most of
   the coliforms passing through the filters during this period were
   injured because they failed to grow on m-Endo but were enumerated on
   m-T7 medium.  These results indicate that the post backwash period can
   be characterized by comparatively higher levels of turbidity as well as
   coliforms that cannot be detected using accepted enumeration methods. 
   Furthermore, such undetected bacteria may seed the distribution system. 
   Therefore, improved bacteriological surveillance for injured coliforms
   in filter effluents could guide the establishment and design of
   filter-to-waste periods.  This would reduce the incidence of coliforms
   in some municipal potable water systems.}},

Abstract = {{A process study on separation and recovery of Cr(III) from tannery
   sludge is presented.  The main steps of the process include Cr(III)
   extraction with sulphuric acid solution at pH 1.  Cr(III) oxidation to
   Cr(VI) with H2O2, Cr(VI) separation from other cations and its
   subsequent reduction to Cr(III).  The experimental conditions for each
   of the above steps are optimized on a bench scale.  The overall Cr(III)
   recovery yield from sludges, controlled by the extraction and oxidative
   phases, amounts to 80\%.  Cr(III) recovery from segregated exhausted
   tannery baths, characterized by a low concentration of major cations, is
   quantitative.  The (Fe + Mg)/Cr molar ratio strongly influences the
   H2O2/Cr ratio required to obtain near quantitative Cr(III) oxidation. 
   At present, the running costs may be estimated to be about double that
   of disposing of sludges in controlled landfills.  The tendency to
   eliminate Fe(II) in tannery wastewaters treatment would significantly
   reduce the process cost and make it competitive.}},

Abstract = {{The frequent use of lithium chloride in anaerobic laboratory- and
   pilot-scale tracer studies called for an investigation into the
   potential inhibitory effects of the lithium ion on anaerobic sludge.  A
   new method for measuring specific methanogenic activity (SMA) was
   employed to quantify these effects and results clearly show a
   relationship between the degree of inhibition and the concentration of
   lithium.  In batch studies, continuous exposure to 0.25 g Li+/l resulted
   in minor inhibition, while at 2.0 g Li+/l methanogenic activity
   virtually ceased.  Temporary exposure in a continuous plug flow column
   had no effect at 1.0 g Li+/l, although the activity was reduced at 2.0 g
   Li+/l.  A mechanism for this toxicity is proposed and criteria are given
   for tracer tests using LiCl.  The success of the SMA test indicates its
   potential in similar fields of research.}},

Abstract = {{Rate constants for the direct reactions of ozone with 45 potential
   organic drinking water contaminants, including solvents, haloalkanes,
   esters, aromatics and pesticides (such as alachlor, aldicarb, atrazine,
   carbofuran, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, endrin, glyphosate, etc.),
   have been measured in water in the presence of hydroxyl radical
   scavengers to minimize interfering radical chain reactions.  The data
   demonstrate, again, the electrophilic nature of the ozonation reaction. 
   In addition, for complex molecules, steric factors are important in
   limiting reactivity.  The zwitterionic compound glyphosate exhibits a
   complex pH dependence that is explained by the inductive effect of
   side-chain protonation on the basicity of the amine reaction center. 
   Rate constants for ozone consumption differ from those for compound
   consumption by an amount presumably equal to the reaction stoichiometry.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of 5 different types of u.v. reactors for disinfecting
   secondary effluent was tested in continuous experiments lasting 4-10
   weeks.  The units were hydraulically characterized by tracer studies and
   microbiologically calibrated by measuring the inactivation of a model
   organism, for which the F-specific RNA bacteriophage MS2 was used.  All
   units could be described as a number of completely mixed tanks in series
   in which the inactivation follows first-order kinetics in both the
   number of organisms and the u.v. dose.  The u.v. dose could be
   calculated from the product of the average retention time and the
   average u.v. intensity in the reactor.  The average u.v. intensity could
   be calculated using the infinite line source model and the extinction
   coefficient of the water measured in unfiltered samples, which varied
   between 90 and 140 m-1 (transmittance 1 cm cuvette between 25 and 40\%).
   From experiments with naturally polluted secondary effluent,
   inactivation rate constants for the vegetative bacteria E. coli and
   faecal streptococci of 0.0055 and 0.0029 m2/J (log10-base),
   respectively, were found.  For the bacterial spores of sulphite-reducing
   clostridia this constant was 0.00063 m2/J and for somatic coliphages and
   F-specific bacteriophages values of 0.0069 and 0.0023 m2/J,
   respectively, were found.  Enteroviruses were usually inactivated below
   the level of detection (1 PFU/101.), hence no quantitative results can
   be presented.  The inactivation rate constant for reoviruses was 0.0024
   m2/J, very close to the constant for F-specific bacteriophages, which
   makes the latter organisms, which are relatively easy to count, very
   suitable as an indicator organism for virus inactivation by u.v.
   radiation.
   The inactivation rate constant for a pure culture of MS2 was 0.0046,
   which is twice the value for F-specific phages as naturally occurring in
   sewage.  This emphasizes the need to design u.v. reactors on the basis
   of data obtained with effluents rather than laboratory-strains of
   micro-organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of several physiological groups of microorganisms (general
   aerobic bacteria, amylolytic bacteria, denitrifying bacteria,
   actinomycetes and fungi) was investigated in wastewater, seepage water,
   and soil samples in areas of sewer leakage.  The results were compared
   with the findings for several chemical parameters (pH value, electrical
   conductivity, and total organic carbon <TOC>) analysed.
   Wastewater infiltration causes an increase in the TOC concentration of
   seepage water samples.  In the same samples, an increase in general
   aerobic bacteria and denitrifying bacteria was recorded.  General
   aerobic bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi were more abundant in
   contaminated soil samples than in non-contaminated ones.  The occurrence
   of denitrifying bacteria and amylolytic bacteria in the soil samples did
   not show correlations to sewer leaks.
   The relationship between results from the chemical and microbiological
   analyses not only indicates contamination of seepage water and soil due
   to wastewater exfiltration, but also provides information on the
   degradation potential of microorganisms and a part of this decomposition
   process in the underground.
   The knowledge of the occurrence of various physiological groups of
   microorganisms is of extraordinary importance for classifying and
   judging the level of contamination, as well as for choosing a renovation
   process.  In an epidemiological view, the bacteria and viruses
   pathogenic for humans should be considered in the case of wastewater
   exfiltration near drinking water supplies.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic humic and fulvic acids are the main trihalomethane (THM)
   precursors formed during surface water chlorination.  The plot of THM
   concentration against humic substance levels is a `'convex''-shape,
   suggesting that a multi-step reaction occurs.  In the first step,
   organochlorine intermediates are produced, and, in the second step,
   these are converted to THM.  A mechanistic model, based on the reaction
   of chlorine with model compounds, is used to derive kinetic equations
   for THM formation as a function of the precursor and chlorine
   concentrations under controlled pH and temperature conditions.  This
   paper describes the application of this model and the correlation

Abstract = {{The aqueous geochemistry of chromium is reviewed, especially with
   reference to the recent work of Rai et al.  (Report EPRI EA-4544, 1986,
   Report EPRI EA-5741, 1988).  The chromium content of natural waters is
   generally low whereas rocks exhibit a wide range of Cr concentrations. 
   In natural environments, the most stable oxidation states of chromium
   are Cr(III) and Cr(VI).  The following minerals can control the
   dissolved chromium content of natural waters:  Cr(OH)3(s) and (Fe,
   Cr)(OH)3 (ss) for Cr(III).  Major Cr(III) disolved species are CrOH2+
   and Cr(OH)3(0), as well as several organic and a few inorganic
   complexes, whereas HCrO4- and CrO4(2-) are the main forms of Cr(VI) in
   natural waters.  The chromium distribution is also controlled by redox
   processes.  Oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI), poor with dissolved oxygen,
   is very effective in the presence of solid MnO2.  Fe(II)- and organic
   matter-rich environments favour the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). 
   Interaction with solid phases can also regulate the chromium content of
   water.  Cr(III) exhibits a typical cationic sorption behaviour.  Its
   adsorption increases with pH, but decreases when competing cations are
   present.  Chromium (VI), on the other hand, exhibits a typical anionic
   sorption behaviour.  Its adsorption decreases with increasing pH and
   when competing dissolved anions are present.
   The migration of chromium is determined by the competition between
   complexation, dissolution/precipitation, redox processes and
   adsorption/desorption mechanisms.  Cr(III) will migrate under acidic
   conditions and/or if present as dissolved organic matter complexes. 
   Hexavalent chromium generally migrates rapidly but its mobility is
   inhibited when the Fe(II) and organic matter concentrations are high and
   when sorption processes are favoured (low pH).}},

Abstract = {{Two laboratory continuous activated sludge units were run.  One unit was
   an OSA system with anaerobic stabilization of returned sludge and the
   other a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system, operated as a
   control unit.  Excess biomass from both systems was used as inoculum for
   batch experiments in order to study the kinetic behaviour of
   microorganisms originally grown in oxic-anaerobic conditions.  All
   experiments were carried out with synthetic wastewater.  Biomass growth,
   substrate removal, oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production were
   measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Inficon IQ 200) coupled
   to a 15-1. fermentor (Biolafitte).  The results showed that at initial
   S0/X0 ratios higher than 2, cell division occurred, which was
   demonstrated by an acceleration of substrate removal and biomass growth
   rates.  This division was synchronized (simultaneously occurring cell
   multiplication) in the case of activated sludge from the OSA unit.  The
   synchronization was induced by periodical exposure of the microorganisms
   to unfavourable conditions of growth due to starvation under anaerobic
   conditions.  The primary aim of this paper is to point out the existence
   of synchronized cell division in certain laboratory activated sludge
   systems and to determine the conditions under which this phenomenon can
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{The photodegradation of chloroform and of urea in aqueous solutions was
   investigated under near-u.v. and visible radiation using the anatase
   form of TiO2 as catalyst. It has been shown that the catalytic activity
   of the TiO2 can be increased by loading silver, in a proportion of 1\%
   (w/w), onto the oxide surface. In a solution containing 200 mg l-1 of
   chloroform, the photodegradation achieved using the Ag-loaded oxide was
   44\% compared to the 35\% obtained using the pure (unloaded) oxide. This
   photoactivity was further enhanced in a solution containing 25 mg l-1 of
   chloroform. Upon reuse, a decrease in the photocatalytic activity was
   observed in both oxides, but to a lesser extent in the Ag-loaded TiO2.
   An increase in the photocatalytic activity of the silver-loaded oxide
   was also noted in the degradation of a 100 mg l-1 aqueous solution of
   urea. After 12 min of irradiation, the Ag-loaded oxide destroyed 83\% of
   this compound, compared to a 16\% efficiency obtained for the pure form
   of anatase. After 6 h of irradiation, 0.5 mg l-1 of silver ions were
   detected in the Ag-loaded TiO2 suspension.}},

Abstract = {{The survival patterns of two wild strains of Escherichia coli (clinical
   isolates from human faeces) were compared during in situ exposure of the
   organisms to environmental freshwater in dialysis tubing sacs.  The
   sublethal stress was evaluated by both standard enumeration techniques
   on selective or non-selective solid media and an electrochemical
   detection procedure based on the potentiometric measurement of lipoic
   acid reduction.  Apparent growth rates were calculated from the
   potentiometric data, providing accurate information on the ability of
   injured bacteria to multiply.  Significant differences between the
   survival patterns of the two bacterial strains were highlighted by both
   the electrochemical and the conventional techniques.  The recovery of
   both strains on coliform-selective, lactose-deoxycholate agar was much
   less efficient than on non-selective solid medium.  From the standard
   plate counts on non-selective agar, the time required for the cell
   population to decrease by 90\% of its original value varied from 7 to 20
   days, according to the strain tested.  Using coliform-selective plate
   counts, this time was reduced to 3 or 10 days, respectively.  The loss
   in viability was correlated with an increase in the potentiometric
   generation time, which increased from 19 to 33 min in 22 days for one
   strain, from 20 to 48 min in 8 days for the other strain.  This study
   shows that the potentiometric technique may be suitable to evaluate the
   sublethal stress of micro-organisms released in natural environments.}},

Abstract = {{An inexpensive but accurate enzymatic method is proposed for the
   detection of carbamate and organophosphorus pesticides contaminating
   water supplies.  The method uses an acetylcholinesterase preparation
   obtained after extraction of rat brain microsomal fraction with Triton
   X-100.  The method is based on inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in the
   presence of the pesticides.  Some phosphorothionate insecticides (e.g.
   parathion, malathion), which are not direct acetylcholinesterase
   inhibitors, can also be activated by preincubation with the enzyme
   preparation.
   Enzyme assay is performed by a potentiometric method based on the
   formation of acetic acid in the incubation mixture.  Interference of any
   eventual buffering capacity of the sample can be easily corrected. 
   Malathion, parathion, diazinon and deoxicarbamate inhibited the enzyme
   at least 20\% when they were added to the medium in the limit
   concentration recommended for public water supplies (0.1 mg/l).  The
   method was evaluated in samples collected from selected locations of
   Paraiba do Sul river, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and it proved to be
   sufficiently practical and accurate as an alarm routine test for such
   pesticide classes.}},

Abstract = {{A technique for measuring the density of activated sludge solids is
   reported in this paper.  Along with particle size and shape, solids
   density is a factor in the removal efficiency of secondary clarifiers. 
   Density gradient centrifugation, a technique widely used in the
   biological sciences, was adapted to measure the density of activated
   sludge solids.  Density gradient centrifugation consists of allowing the
   solid particles to settle in a fluid of continuously increasing density
   until the particles become stationary.  At this point, particle and the
   fluid densities are equal.  This technique was used to measure the
   density of activated sludge solids at several treatment plants in the
   Sacramento area.  The density of activated sludge solids at a given
   treatment plant over a period of time was relatively constant.  However,
   at different treatment plants densities ranged from a low of 1.02 to a
   high of 1.06 g/ml, indicating that plant operations may influence solids
   density.  Using the measured density of secondary solids, variation in
   settling velocities was estimated using the following assumptions, (1)
   discrete particle settling; (2) an average particle diameter of
   100-mu-m; and (3) laminar flow conditions.  The corresponding settling
   velocities for particles with densities of 1.02 and 1.06 g/ml are
   16.9-26.8 m/day.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model of a high-rate anaerobic treatment system was
   developed by defining the biological make-up of the anaerobic ecosystem,
   the physico-chemical system, and the reactor process. The biological
   model was extended from current theory to include the accumulation of
   lactic acid under specific process conditions. Product inhibition and pH
   inhibition of each group of bacteria were represented in the model so as
   to utilize all the available information about the anaerobic process. A
   rigorous approach was applied to the development of the physico-chemical
   model which was used in the determination of the reactor pH and ionic
   species concentrations. The overall reactor equations were based on
   continuous well-mixed processes, with no effective solids residence time
   parameter introduced to account for bacterial retention in the process.
   Parameters were taken from models developed by previous researchers, and
   from mixed and pure culture studies of the anaerobic bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{A structured model of the anaerobic degradation process, incorporating
   dynamic equations for the description of a single-stage high-rate
   anaerobic reactor was validated by comparing its predictions with
   previously reported experimental data.  This data came from two
   different laboratory-scale reactors and a pilot-scale reactor.  With the
   manipulation of key model parameters, significant improvements in the
   fit of the model to the experimental data were possible.  This study was
   able to show that the production and consumption of lactic acid, and the
   moderate hydrogen inhibition and regulation of the acidic products of
   the acidogenic bacteria, can be successfully modelled.  Insufficient
   experimental data were available to draw conclusions as to the
   importance of product inhibition in anaerobic reactors, while the need
   to use deterministic models to account for pH inhibition highlighted the
   need to develop mechanistic models able to reflect the pH inhibited
   behaviour of the major anaerobic groups present in the ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the kinetics of aerobic biological degradation of
   chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, specifically trichloroethene (TCE),
   1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA), cis-1,2-dichloroethene (c-1,2-DCE) and
   trans-1,2-dichloroethene (t-1,2-DCE).
   The kinetics were determined by using a completely mixed laboratory
   biofilm reactor seeded with methane-oxidizing (methanotrophic) bacteria
   originally obtained from an aquifer contaminated with chlorinated
   hydrocarbons.  The contaminant degradation followed first order kinetics
   in the concentration range 0-1 mg/l.  TCA was degraded with the same
   reaction rate as TCE.  In other studies with methanotrophic bacteria TCA
   appear to be non-biodegradable.  In general, the degradation of TCE, TCA
   and c-1,2-DCE was relatively slow at 20-24-degrees-C, whereas t-1,2-DCE
   was transformed relatively fast.
   The growth of methane oxidizing bacteria in the biofilm was studied. 
   The biofilm thickness increased linearly for a constant loading of
   methane.
   The formation of c-1,2-DCE epoxide was presumably an intermediate from
   c-1,2-DCE degradation, and t-1,2-DCE epoxide was probably formed from
   t-1,2-DCE.
   This work indicates that in order to make the aerobic degradation of the
   chlorinated hydrocarbons practically feasible methods are required for
   increasing the biodegradation rate of TCE, TCA and c-1,2-DCE.}},

Abstract = {{A technique is described for the sensitive and selective determination
   of Rhodamine WT water tracer. This technique, that is based on the
   combined application of solid-phase extraction (SPE) using a C18-column
   and HPLC separation with fluorescence detection for analysis, has
   important advantages over direct fluorometric techniques. The approach
   presented in this paper is in essence a zero-background method, so that
   much lower concentrations of dyes can be measured. The SPE step provides
   a means to improve the detection limit further. For clean waters
   detection limits in the sub-ppt region (in the order of 10 pg/l) are
   easily attainable. In addition the SPE-HPLC procedure does not suffer
   from the disturbances of environmental circumstances, like pH, salinity,
   temperature, chlorine concentration and presence of suspended matter and
   algae, that may interfere with direct fluorometric determinations. The
   HPLC-based approach appears a rugged and accurate method with a long
   term repeatability of better than 5\%.}},

Abstract = {{A non-equilibrium steady state box model is reported, that predicts the
   fate of new chemicals in a conventional sewage treatment plant from a
   minimal input data set.  The model, written in an electronic spreadsheet
   (Lotus(TM) 123), requires a minimum input:  some basic properties of the
   chemical, its emission rate and a few parameters to account for the
   scale and mode of operation of the plant.  Compound properties necessary
   as input are air-water and sludge solids-water partition coefficients. 
   If these distribution coefficients are not available but the compound is
   hydrophobic, default values are calculated from input such as
   solubility, vapour pressure and octanol-water partition coefficient. 
   Biodegradability data and the degree of dissociation or protonation are
   the required input data to account for degradation and speciation
   changes of the chemical in the water phase.  The modelled sewage
   treatment installation consists of primary sedimentation and the
   activated sludge technique.  The standard output shows the chemical's
   concentration in effluent and sludge.  In addition the output contains
   the relative amounts degraded and emitted via effluent, sludge and air. 
   The main advantage of this approach is that it provides legislators with
   a quick insight if a chemical will be an air, water or sludge pollutant
   when it is discharged into sewage works at a certain rate.  Examples are
   evaluated and results are compared with measured concentrations. 
   Volatilization rates derived from reported field data are in good

Abstract = {{The BOD exertion phenomenon, being a result of complex biochemical
   reactions between the heterogeneous assemblage of biota and the complex
   organic substrate, shows a lag phase, followed by a rising curve
   terminated at a plateau, and again a saturating type increasing curve
   yielding an ultimate carbonacious BOD. For the substrate rich in
   nitrogenous compounds, there is a further increase in the BOD curve,
   saturating at the second stage ultimate BOD value. The BOD kinetics
   models in vogue describe a particular phase or stage only, and lack in
   general applicability over the entire exertion process. Presented herein
   is a generalized BOD exertion equation valid over all the phases and

   population was found to be dependent upon prevailing environmental
   factors and plant operating conditions.  As these also control the
   quality of the final effluent, it was possible to correlate plant
   performance and operating conditions with the distribution of species
   within the activated sludge reactor.  A method for predicting effluent
   quality and operating conditions from the structure of the protozoal
   community was derived based on multiple regression analysis.  The number
   of protozoa required for a successful prediction was minimized from 31
   to 20 without a significant loss of accuracy using stepwise regression

Abstract = {{Direct and radicalic ozonation of pyridine in aqueous solution is
   investigated.  Experiments are performed in a semibatch apparatus with
   continuous admission of ozone to the reacting solution.  Reaction
   processes are followed by means of HPLC and chemical analyses at
   different ozonation times.  Direct ozonation is performed by addition of
   t-butanol to the reacting system to prevent radicalic development.  In
   these conditions the ozonation of pyridine mainly leads to production of
   pyridine N-oxide according to first-order kinetics with respect to both
   ozone and pyridine.  Ozonation experiments at different pHs (3.0-6.0)
   indicate that pyridinium ion has no appreciable reactivity towards
   ozone.  A direct ozonation process thus occurs through the electrophilic
   attack of ozone on the nitrogen atom of pyridine with a rate constant k
   = 2.0 +/- 0.3 mol-1 l s-1 at 298 K.
   Ozonation experiments which allow radicalic development of the reaction
   process show that pyridine oxidation occurs with a strong cleavage of
   the heterocyclic ring even in the initial ozonation stage.  Ammonia,
   nitrate and amidic compounds, among which is N-formyl oxamic acid, are
   produced.  Formation also of nitroso and/or nitro derivatives can be
   inferred by the experimental results.  Radicalic ozonation of pyridine
   exhibits an autocatalytic character as shown by the rapid increase of
   the reaction rate in the initial ozonation stage.  Autocatalysis is
   likely due to reaction intermediates coming from slow direct attack of
   ozone on pyridine and is capable of promoting the ozone decomposition in
   aqueous solution.  A reaction scheme based on the addition of hydroxyl
   radicals to the aromatic ring of pyridine is proposed to explain the
   observed products distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Four field experiments designed to simulate the effects of the
   individual components of farm waste effluent (increased ammonia, reduced
   dissolved oxygen concentrations) on the invertebrate fauna of receiving
   waters were carried out on two second order streams in South Wales.  In
   two studies the dissolved oxygen concentration was reduced to 2 and 1
   mgl-1 by the oxidation of sodium sulphite, and in a further two studies
   ammonia concentrations were raised to 5 and 7 mgl-1 by dosing with
   ammonium chloride and the toxicant maintained in the unionized state by
   the simultaneous addition of sodium hydroxide to raise pH to approx. pH
   9.  During each simulation (6-24 h in duration) the response of several
   invertebrate species placed in the downstream treatment zone(s) was
   compared with that of animals maintained in an upstream untreated
   reference zone.  Significant invertebrate mortalities were recorded only
   under conditions of reduced dissolved oxygen.  The feeding rate of
   Gammarus pulex was significantly reduced during dosing with ammonia but
   recovered post-exposure.  Parasitism of G. pulex with Pomphorhynchus
   laevis resulted in a reduced feeding rate and an increased mortality in
   comparison to unifected animals.  The disruption of precopula in G.
   pulex was a sensitive and rapid indicator of stress under both reduced
   dissolved oxygen and increased ammonia concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Seawater samples collected from two beaches with different levels of
   pollution were studied for the presence of classically and newly
   proposed faecal indicators such as, total and faecal coliforms, faecal
   streptococci, coliphages, F-specific phages and bacteriophages of
   Bacteroides fragilis.
   Total and faecal coliforms showed lower survival rates in seawater than
   faecal streptococci, F-specific bacteriophages and coliphages.  On the
   other hand, total coliform concentrations were only higher than those of
   faecal coliforms in heavily polluted seawater, although in samples with
   a low level of pollution, faecal streptococci and Escherichia coli C
   phage counts were generally than those showed by faecal coliforms.
   The low concentration in which F-specific and B. fragilis bacteriophages
   were detected in marine waters compared to the E. coli bacteriophage
   levels, in an important shortcoming for the general use of the former
   microorganisms as universal indicators of faecal pollution.  From the
   results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that faecal
   streptococci and E. coli C bacteriophages are the most appropriate
   indicators of the remote pollution in marine waters.}},

Abstract = {{Additive joint actions of chemicals should be taken into consideration
   in the development of ecotoxicologically relevant water quality
   criteria.  Existing criteria generally are derived for single chemicals,
   yet no natural waters exist in which only one compound is present.  In
   order to determine the joint action of eight metals and to evaluate the
   Dutch water quality criteria for these metals, chronic toxicity tests
   were conducted with cohorts and populations of Daphnia magna.  Four
   types of effects were distinguished, i.e. survival (LC50), body growth
   and intrinsic rate of natural population increase (r(m)) which were
   derived from individual daphnids, and maximum obtainable yield (EC50)
   from experiments with populations.
   Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, lead, nickel and zinc were
   tested singly and in equitoxic mixtures based on the LC50 (individual D.
   magna) or EC50 (populations) of the individual metals.  The expected
   toxicities of these mixtures were expressed as toxic units (TU) based on
   concentration addition.  The LC50 and EC50 of the mixtures were 1.8 and
   1.6 TU respectively, indicating an additive chronic toxicity of the
   metals with respect to individual survival as well as population growth
   of D. magna.
   Combined at the maximum levels of the present Dutch water quality
   criteria these metals were severely toxic to D. magna and caused 50\%
   mortality in Salmo gairdneri, the latter exposed for 60 days during
   embryo-larval development.  Even a reduction of these concentrations by
   a factor of five produced a 10\% decrease of the yield of D. magna
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal changes in physico-chemical parameters and photosynthetic
   microorganisms were studied during a seasonal cycle (October-July) in an
   8 m deep self-depuration wastewater lagoon in the south east of Spain. 
   The mild climate of the area confers great potential on this type of
   water depuration.  A first bloom of Chlamydomonas sp. dominated the
   system during the period of heavy organic contamination.  This algal
   species disappeared without noticeable proliferation of the zooplankton
   grazer community.  A second phase of water depuration was characterized
   by proliferation of small chlorophytes, mainly of the genera Golenkinia,
   Chlorella and Scenedesmus.  Rotifers and ciliates grazed on this second
   bloom giving rise to a third one, dominated by a small cyanophyte
   (0.5-1.5 m) of the genus Synechococcus, when nutrient levels above the
   thermocline were low (2.5 mg PO43-/l and 1.0 mg NH4+/l).  The cyanophyte
   population was controlled by rotifers, copepods and cladocerans up to
   the end of the study.  Two blooms of photosynthetic bacteria were
   identified.  The first one, occupying the whole water column, coincided
   in time with Chlamydomonas and an organic-rich phase of the water
   column.  It was dominated by Thiocapsa sp. and Chromatium sp., both of
   them sulphur red photosynthetic bacteria.  The second bloom, of the
   green photosynthetic bacteria Chlorobium, established at and below the
   thermocline when H2S concentrations reached 95 mg/l.  The detection of
   all these easily identifiable organisms has proved to be very useful as
   bioindicators of the water depuration stage in deep lagoons of the area.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper summarizes an approach recently proposed in The
   Netherlands to use the equilibrium partitioning (EP) method to derive a
   coherent set of quality criteria for aquatic systems.  The quality
   criteria refer to dissolved concentrations, the concentrations in the
   suspended particles, the total (dissolved + particulate) concentrations
   and the concentrations in the sediment.  The quality criteria have been
   derived for standard sediment, standard water and standard suspended
   matter.  Emphasis is laid on the relation between effect data and
   physicochemical data.  Two types of effect data have been used, i.e.
   effects on aquatic toxicity (direct effects) and health related effects
   (product standards).  Both types of data have been translated into the
   above mentioned criteria by means of EP.  For the calculation of
   criteria in sediment and suspended matter solids-water partition
   coefficients K(sw) have been used.  Examples have been given for cadmium
   and hexachlorobenzene.  The handled equations have been summarized in
   diagrams.}},

Abstract = {{A budget model is developed to predict the long-term response of a lake
   to changes in its phosphorus loading.  This model computes total
   phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations, taking sediment-water
   interactions into account.
   The lake is treated as two segments:  the water and a surface sediment
   layer.  A total phosphorus budget for the water accounts for inputs due
   to external loading and recycle from the sediments.  It reflects losses
   due to flushing and settling.  The sediment layer gains total phosphorus
   by settling and loses total phosphorus by recycle and burial.  The
   recycle from the sediments to the water is dependent on the levels of
   sediment total phosphorus and hypolimnetic oxygen.  Hypolimnetic oxygen
   concentration is estimated with a semi-empirical model.
   The model is applied to Shagawa Lake.  An analysis is performed to
   demonstrate how its predictions replicate in-lake changes not possible
   with simpler phosphorus budget models.}},

Abstract = {{For many chemical compounds there is much information about their
   toxicity and biodegradability, but hardly an ecotoxicological
   investigations take into consideration how xenobiotic substances are
   integrated into complex biological systems.  Here it is shown that
   4-chloro-3-cresol (CMC), a chlorinated phenolic derivative used as a
   disinfectant and preservative, is completely eliminated within the
   process of natural self-purification, imitated in a lab-scaled river
   model.  Biodegration of CMC occurred after the elimination of other
   organic compounds (synthetic sewage) which were easier to degrade.  The
   nitrification of ammonia only started after CMC had been completely
   degraded.  The kinetics of substrate oxidation (acetate) measured by
   oxygen consumption (Warburg-method) were inhibited noncompetitively by
   CMC.  The gradual increase of the CMC concentration in the influent of
   the plant led to an increasing insensitiveness of the bacterial
   biocoenosis so that the kinetics of substrate oxidation in the presence
   of CMC resulted in a decrease of the inhibitory effect (increasing
   inhibition constant K(i)).  The rate of CMC degradation referring to the
   biomass concentration increased with increasing CMC concentration in the
   influent, which indicated a growth of CMC-degrading bacteria within the
   total population.  CMC degradation itself was inhibited at high
   concentrations ({''}substrate surplus inhibition{''}).  In addition
   higher CMC concentrations in the influent of the river model led to a
   change of (1) the bacterial community and (2) the diversity of ciliates
   populations.  In practice the separation of the processes of the
   elimination of easy biodegradable substances and of the degradation of
   CMC (e.g. activated sludge reactor and trickling filter) should be
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{The mobilization of organic compounds and the release of CO2 was studied
   in aquifer material from a site chosen for thermal energy storage (ETS).
   These processes have been measured aerobically and anaerobically within
   a temperature range of 4-95-degrees-C in sediment samples consisting of
   either quartz-rich coarse sand or peaty clay.  At temperatures above
   45-degrees-C organic carbon compounds, including fulvic acids, were
   mobilized from both sediments resulting in an increased chemical oxygen
   demand of the water phase.  Complexation of calcium and magnesium by
   fulvic acids resulted in the supersaturation of the water phase with
   regard to calcite and dolomite and thus prevented the precipitation of
   these carbonates.  The highest rates of CO2 release were observed during
   the first 4 days.  Aerobically, the maximum velocity for CO2 formation
   varied between 35 and 800 (sand) or 15 and 150 (peaty clay) mu-mol CO2
   per gram volatile solids per day.  Anaerobically, similar rates were
   observed, namely 25-500 (sand) and 10-110 (peaty clay) mu-mol CO2 per
   gram volatile solids.  At temperatues above 55-degrees-C, CO2 was
   produced purely chemically.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{SED is a dynamic model describing the release of phosphorus from
   sediments in shallow, eutrophic lakes.  The model includes only three
   state-variables (dissolved and organic particulate phosphorus, active
   sediment layer), simple relationships between the variables and a
   restricted number of parameters.  Besides, the diffusive transport of
   dissolved phosphorus to the overlying water, mineralization of organic
   phosphorus in the sediment and ad-desorption and fixation of inorganic
   phosphorus are described.
   The model solves the differential equations for organic phosphorus and
   dissolved inorganic phosphorus in the sediments analytically; the
   calculation time step is 1 day.  The use of one active layer, with a
   variable thickness between the aerobic zone and the layer subject to
   turbation, and the concept of coupling inorganic processes to
   mineralization results in a relative simple model structure. 
   Calibration is performed with data sets of the shallow Lake Veluwe, The
   Netherlands.
   SED is capable of reproducing phosphorus retention in Lake Veluwe and
   yields realistic values for the net phosphorus release from the
   sediment, both in magnitude and in seasonal pattern.  The change in
   external loading resulted in a significant decrease of retention and
   release.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown the Gammarus:Asellus ratio to be useful in
   assessing organic enrichment in lowland rivers.  Three types of
   artificial substratum colonization sampler i.e. Standard Autwuchs Unit
   (S.Auf.U), airbrick and basket samplers containing graded stones were
   compared with conventional Surber direct sampler data to determine the
   effects of passive sampling techniques on the ratio.
   The Standard Aufwuchs Unit and airbrick substratum colonization samplers
   provided Grammarus:Asellus ratios which showed some correspondence with
   the ratio derived from Surber data and performed well in the assessment
   of water quality at all sites.
   Basket samplers were found to have some degree of selectivity,
   particularly by Gammarus, for substrata having sizes of interstices
   corresponding with body size.  The results from the basket sampler date
   therefore were inconclusive as colonization of these types of samplers
   are affected by factors other than pollution.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of using bacteriophages as models for the fate of viruses
   in natural waters and water treatment is reviewed with special attention
   to the somatic coliphages, the F-specific RNA phages and phages of
   Bacteroides fragilis.  Enumeration from highly contaminated samples can
   be achieved by plaque counts or enrichment methods; for less polluted
   samples a variety of concentration procedures is available and has been
   derived mainly from techniques developed for enteroviruses. 
   International standardization of methods is necessary to promote further
   development of the field.  Bacteriophages have promise as process
   indicators for viruses.  F-specific RNA bacteriophages are a more
   homogeneous group than somatic coliphages and have generally a greater
   resistance.  The value of somatic coliphages is further limited by their
   ability to multiply in unpolluted waters.  Both groups are an index of
   sewage contamination rather than faecal contamination, hence their
   ecology is different from human enteric viruses.  Phages of Bacteroides
   fragilis have been reported to occur exclusively in human faeces but
   little is known about their behaviour in water treatment processes.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sludge containing selected
   semivolatile organic pollutants was investigated.  Typical digester
   operation was simulated with three, complete-mix, bench-scale digesters
   maintained at 35.5-degrees-C with a 30 day solids retention time.  Two
   digesters were fed a primary and secondary sludge mixture produced from
   wastewater spiked with twenty semivolatile organics from the CERCLA
   pollutant list.  The remaining digester (the control) was fed a similar
   mixture of sludge, but with no added organics.  Operational parameters
   were monitored to compare the test and control units.  All parameters
   were found to be within the limits of normal operation.  Performance was
   near identical.  An isotope dilution GC/MS method was employed for
   organics analysis of influent and effluent streams for all reactors. 
   Steady-state fates of the organics were determined by mass balance. 
   Twelve of the chemicals appear consistently and at steady state. 
   Degradation was apparent for all components, with at least 10\% of each
   parent compound partially or completely transformed.  Sorption onto
   digester solids was an important removal mechanism.  Results of organic
   analysis for the control digester highlight the effects of metabolic
   interferences.}},

Abstract = {{A simplified model of the lake-sediment system is proposed, which aims
   to predict the long term evolution and the recovery time of eutrophied
   lakes.
   The model represents the state of lake and sediment each by means of a
   single variable.  Having recourse to a well-defined set of assumptions
   as for sediment processes, and adopting time independent coefficients,
   the model balance equations can be solved analytically, and the
   evolution of the state variables towards steady state conditions, can be
   discussed in terms of characteristic times of the considered system. 
   Particular attention is devoted to the consequences of P saturation of
   the solid phase in surface sediment layers, i.e. to a situation which is
   frequently present in eutrophied lakes.
   The model is applied to the case of the highly eutrophied Lake Varese
   (Northern Italy), in which internal P loadings from sediments appear to
   be substantial.
   Taking into account the coupling between lake and sediments, the time
   needed to attain the steady state P concentration compatible with the
   present P loadings is evaluated as approximately 5 times the water
   renewal time of the lake.
   It is also shown to what extent the assumptions on sediment dynamics
   affect the model predictions.}},

Abstract = {{The distributions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in two rivers
   flowing through heavily populated areas, Besos and Llobregat, have been
   investigated.  River waters have been analyzed monthly for a period of
   13 months.  Marine samples from the coastal area where these rivers
   discharge as well as from other coastal sites situated away from river
   influence have also been studied.  Petrogenic hydrocarbons, essentially
   C1-C5 alkylbenzenes and C8-C20 n-alkanes, are the major volatile
   compounds present in these rivers (estimated annual discharge 260 metric
   tons).  Chlorinated benzenes, C10-C13 alkylbenzenes, some terpenes and
   tributylphosphates are other main VOC with estimated outputs to seawater
   of 27, 14, 7 and 2 metric tons per year, respectively.  The VOC
   concentrations in the rivers are generally between two and three orders
   of magnitude higher than in the marine samples.  The discharges of the
   Besos and Llobregat Rivers result in  significant increases of C10-C13
   alkylbenzenes, tributylphosphate, hexachlorobutadiene and chlorobenzenes
   to the nearby coastal area.  However, in the case of petrogenic
   hydrocarbons, the background concentration resulting from marine traffic
   and related activities developed in the area outnumbers the riverine
   contributions.}},

   Possibly, the high concentration of refractory organic material in the

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of using the microbial insecticide Bacillus
   thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) to control the nuisance fly
   Sylvicola fenestralis at Rossendale Sewage Works, Lancashire, was
   investigated.  Following a provisional trial in 1987, the whole Works
   (28 filter beds) was treated with a two-stage application of Bti in
   1988; the first application in late April was separated from the second
   in late May by about half the length of the Sylvicola life-cycle.  The
   Bti treatment was timed to reduce fly nuisance in June, the month when
   most complaints (71\%) had been received.  For each application, 0.161.
   of the Bti preparation, containing nearly 10(10) spores.cm-3, was
   applied per square metre of bed surface.  An 80 and 98\% kill of
   Sylvicola larvae was recorded following the first and second
   applications respectively.  The lower kill achieved by the first
   application was believed to be due to insufficient mixing of the Bti
   with the settled sewage prior to dosing.  Nuisance caused by the flies
   was considerably reduced; there were no complaints from the public
   during June, although a few were received in late July, early August. 
   Sewage purification efficiency was not affected by Bti treatment.  The
   maximum concentration of Bti spores in the Works' effluent was 7 x 10(4)
   spores.cm-3.  This concentration did not appear to affect the already
   impoverished macro-invertebrate fauna of the receiving river.}},

Abstract = {{Linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS) acts on the zygotes of the sea
   urchin Paracentrotus lividus, inducing total inhibition of skeletal
   development at concentrations higher than 0.45 ppm and a significant
   decrease at concentrations of 0.30 ppm.  The effect of the surfactant is
   maximum at the end of gastrulation, when calcium uptake is very high,
   presumably related to the beginning of skeletal growth.  This suggests
   that, in the environment, the sequestering action of LAS on calcium may
   significantly affect the availability of this ion for morphogenesis. 
   Nevertheless, the experimental data presented in this paper suggest that
   the toxic action of LAS is also exerted at levels other than those
   involved in calcium uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Unit area loadings for nitrogen, phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon
   were measured from four sub-watersheds and the entire 256 km2 catchment
   area tributary to the Indian River Lagoon.  The catchment area is a
   rapidly growing suburban area drained by 322 km of canals in east
   central Florida.  One-third of the annual total nitrogen, one-half of
   the total phosphorus and one-fourth of the annual dissolved organic
   carbon were exported in the drainage canal water at the water control
   structure to downstream waters during a 6-week period when three major
   storms occurred.  High annual loadings of dissolved inorganic (1.3 kg
   N/ha-yr) and organic (4.4 kg N/ha-yr) nitrogen were recorded for the
   rotational grazing sub-watershed; during storm events, the entire
   dissolved inorganic nitrogen load leaving the catchment basin originated
   from the agricultural sub-watershed.  Annual total nitrogen and total
   phosphorus export coefficients from the agricultural sub-basin deviated
   considerably from published ``national{''} averages, but were very
   similar to ``regional{''} coefficients published for Wisconsin. 
   Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus had wide variances to the
   published ``regional{''} coefficients, emphasizing the need for

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{375-391}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Storm retention tanks are used widely for regulating pollution caused by
   combined sewer overflows, a notably transient, dynamic phenomenon. 
   Nevertheless, few dynamic models of the process have hitherto been
   proposed.  A conceptual model for simulation of the dynamic performance
   of a storm tank is presented.  Four modes of behaviour are identified: 
   fill, draw, dynamic sedimentation and quiescent settling.  Discussion is
   given of the problems associated with the model, in particular the
   characterization of spatial non-uniformities in pollutant
   concentrations.  Simulation results are presented for the application of
   the model to a test storm disturbance based on field data taken from the
   Norwich Sewage Works in eastern England.  The disturbance comprises the
   response of a sewer network to a high-intensity, short-duration
   precipitation event, with a significant transient increase in suspended
   solids concentration and a transient depression in ammonium-N
   concentration.  The impact of the storm tank returns on primary
   clarifier performance is found to be almost negligible.  Some tests of
   the sensitivity of the storm tank model to changes of its parameters,
   such as particle settling velocity, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive sampling of the built environment was undertaken to determine
   the extent of Legionella presence in different regions of New South
   Wales.  Distribution and abundance of Legionella in N.S.W. were found to
   be similar to those found in Europe and North America, despite
   Australia's warmer climate and geographical isolation.  Air conditioning
   cooling towers, warm water systems and spas showed the highest incidence
   of Legionella (32, 37 and 36\%, respectively).  Legionella pneumophila
   serotypes predominated, being present in 82\% of the positive samples
   examined.  Seasonality in isolation patterns was not detected.  The
   Illawarra Health Region, where a major outbreak has recently occurred,
   was found to have the lowest incidence of Legionella, probably due to
   improved maintenance measures undertaken in the aftermath of the
   outbreak.  It was concluded that the distribution and abundance of
   Legionella in the south-eastern part of Australia follows a comparable
   pattern to elsewhere in the world and that measures to prevent outbreaks
   of Legionnaires' disease should be similar to those currently being
   introduced in the U.S.A. and Great Britain.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater entering Lake Bysjon in southern Sweden is somewhat higher
   in specific conductance and up to 20 times higher in phosphate than the
   mean for the lake.  This leads to elevated values of both specific
   conductance and phosphate in lake water within a 500 m long and several
   meter wide strip along the shore.  In areas not influenced by
   groundwater inflow, specific conductance and phosphorus content near the
   shore are close to that of open lake water.  High concentrations of
   phosphate (up to 9 mg/l PO4-P) in the inflowing groundwater originate
   from riparian zone surrounding the lake.  It is suggested that, over a
   long time, this ecotone has accumulated phosphorus and other nutrients
   that were transported from the adjacent developed areas and arable land.
   This phosphorus is now entering the lake, probably as a result of
   increased decomposition of organic matter.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of longitudinal mixing on nitrification was evaluated in two
   bench scale activated sludge reactors of equal volume, one approximating
   complete mixing (partial = 0.62) and one approximating plug-flow mixing
   (partial = 0.07).  The onset of nitrification was more rapid under
   plug-flow conditions and a higher rate constant for nitrification was
   observed.  Both the numbers and species of nitrifying bacteria were the
   same in both reactors and thus this did not contribute to the observed
   differences.  Lower reaction rates in the complete mix reactor were
   shown to result from a high concentration of free ammonia in the mixed
   liquor, which gave rise to inhibition of nitrifying bacteria.  Over an
   extended operating period, the plug flow reactor produced a sludge which
   demonstrated superior settling properties to that of the complete mix
   reactor.  In addition incidences of sludge bulking were absent, whereas
   they were a regular feature of the complete mix system.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete-site model of ion-binding by humic substances (HS),
   incorporating a description of electrostatic effects, is evaluated with
   analytical data for surface waters of acid pH (3.5-6.5).  After
   optimization of the model by adjustment of the binding-site content of
   the HS, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between measured and
   calculated concentrations of organically-complexed monomeric
   aluminium-{[}Al(m)-org]-is 1-mu-M for a range of measured values of
   0.1-9.0-mu-M (108 samples from 12 different locations).  The
   optimization indicates that the dissolved organic matter of natural
   waters is only about 50\% as `active' (in the sense of ion-binding) as
   isolated HS.  The model, optimized for Al-binding, also accounts for the
   contribution of HS to ionic balance; for 139 samples (from 8 locations)
   with dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the range 4.6-43.0 mg
   l-1, and using measured pH as input for the computations, the mean
   calculated ratio of cations to anions was 1.03, with a standard
   deviation of 0.11.  A similar result was obtained with an optimized
   version of the model of B. G. Oliver, E. M. Thurman and R. L. Malcolm
   (Geochim. cosmochim. Acta 47, 2031-2035, 1983).  For the same 139
   samples, pH values were also calculated, using total measured anion
   concentration as inputs.  The RMSD in pH was 0.35 for all samples, but
   only 0.18 for the 56 samples of pH less-than-or-equal-to 4.5. 
   Statistical analyses indicate that inadequacies in model assumptions,
   including the estimation of concentrations of HS in water samples,
   account for about one-third of the discrepancy between measured and
   calculated {[}Al(m)-org]; the remaining two-third is explained by errors
   in input data and measured {[}Al(m)-org].  In the case of pH prediction,
   no model inadequacy is apparent, because of the high sensitivity of the
   calculations to errors in input data.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model has been developed to predict radiocaesium
   concentrations over time within individual compartments of the lake and
   its catchment.  The lake has been divided into five compartments;
   catchment, lake water (epilimnion and hypolimnion during
   stratification), lake sediment and fish.  Radiocaesium enters the lake
   via contaminated rainfall and catchment runoff.  A proportion of this
   radiocaesium absorbs onto suspended solids in the lake.  This proportion
   is represented by a distribution coefficient.  Sedimentation of the
   suspended solids occurs at a rate defined by the areal removal
   coefficient and results in increased caesium concentrations in the
   sediment.  The ingestion of radiocaesium by either water column or
   benthic feeding fish is described by transfer functions.  The model has
   been tested against data collected form Esthwaite water and Windermere
   shortly after the Chernobyl reactor accident from May 1986 to December
   1987.  The model simulates observed radiocaesium concentrations in
   Esthwaite lake water and sediment and also in lake water, sediment and
   fish in Windermere.  The model could form the basis of a valuable
   management tool for the water industry should a major airborne pollution
   event occur again.}},

Abstract = {{The faecal coliform concentration of overland flow and streamwater
   within a small catchment in the Yorkshire Dales was monitored over a 2
   year period.  Strong and consistent seasonal trends in bacterial
   concentration were found.  During the height of summer (mid June to the
   end of August), faecal coliform concentrations in streamwater were found
   to be significantly higher than at other times of year.  Consistently
   low concentrations were found during winter months.  These trends
   closely followed those identified for semi-permanent overland flow,
   suggesting a direct causal link between streamwater quality and the
   bacterial concentration of overland flow entering the stream channel. 
   The seasonal trends identified were explained with respect to long term
   changes in the size of the store of enteric bacteria existing in the
   surface soils of the catchment.  Changes in land store size were related
   to seasonal changes in the frequency and amount of rainfall input to the
   catchment.  The implications of the research findings for the management
   of upland catchments used for water supply or recreation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in 20 surface waters in Eastern Finland
   were characterized to examine relationships between structural and
   compositional properties of DOM and partition coefficients (K(p))
   describing sorption of four model contaminants to DOM and the
   bioavailability of contaminants by Daphnia magna.  The hydrophobic acids
   (HbA), hydrophobic neutrals (HbN) and hydrophilic (HI) fractions of DOM
   were separated by XAD-8 resin.  The K(p)s were measured by equilibrium
   dialysis.  Model contaminants were benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), naphthalene
   (NAPH), 3,3',4,4'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (TCB) and dehydroabietic acid
   (DHAA).
   DOM concentrations varied from 2.0 to 38.3 mg org. C/l in the water
   series.  The percentage of HbA and the aromaticity of DOM, as indicated
   by the absorptivity at 270 nm (A270) and hydrogen/carbon ratio (H/C
   ratio), increased with increasing DOM concentration.  Significant
   correlations were observed between K(p) of BAP, A270 and HbA content of
   the DOM from different sources.  For the other contaminants similar
   kinds of relationships between K(p)s and quality parameters of DOM could
   not be found.
   The bioavailability of model compounds was decreased by increasing DOM
   concentration in the water series.  For all four model contaminants,
   measured bioconcentration factors (BCF) correlated well with the A270 of
   a water and HbA content of the DOM.  These results show that the total
   DOM concentration is an important factor controlling the bioavailability
   of xenobiotics in natural waters.  Besides the quantity also the quality
   of DOM, like proportion of HbA, can contribute in bioavailability.}},

Abstract = {{Halo-acetic acids are produced during chlorine disinfection of drinking
   water.  Besides the well-known dichloro-, and trichloroacetic acid,
   brominated and mixed chloro/bromo acetic acids are also produced.  A
   method was developed to determine all halo-acetic acids.  This method
   was applied for the analysis of 20 drinking waters prepared from
   different source waters.  Halo-acetic acids were found in all drinking
   waters prepared from surface water while they could not be detected in
   drinking waters prepared from ground water.  The acid concentrations
   were in the range of 0-14.7-mu-g/l and dibromoacetic acid was found to
   be the most prominent halo-acetic acid in chlorinated waters. 
   Brominated acetic acids accounted for 65\% of the total acid
   concentration showing that brominated compounds form a large part of the
   chlorination products.  The total halo-acetic acid concentration
   correlated positively with the chlorine-to-carbon ratio and with the
   adsorbable organic halogen, to which it accounted for 15\%.}},

Abstract = {{The combined treatment requirements for a high strength phenolic

   Selective pH adjustment of H-coal wastewater followed by diisopropyl
   ether extraction was used to control the phenolic concentration fed to
   the serum bottle cultures.  This pretreatment did not completely remove
   the unidentified inhibitory compound(s) from the wastewater.  Thus the
   addition of activated carbon to the cultures and a reduced feed rate
   were required to stabilize their activity.  However, by the end of the
   250-day test period, the cultures were maintained with a 12.5-day
   hydraulic retention time and were fed approx. 9 parts pH 9-extracted
   H-coal wastewater and 1 part inorganic nutrient solution.  The influent
   phenol concentration was near 900 mg/l, whereas the effluent
   concentration was < 2 mg/l.  Residual dissolved diisopropyl ether did
   not inhibit the anaerobic process nor was it biodegraded to methane.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between the nitrogenous biological oxygen demand (NBOD)
   and the oxidizable nitrogenous pollutants in the Lee River has been
   determined to be dependent upon the hydrological conditions.  When there
   is no water discharge (NWD) from the upper reservoir, this relationship
   is quite clear and definite, but under water discharge (WD) conditions,
   this relationship is ill-defined.  Mean ratios of NBOD5 to BOD5 are
   0.620 for the NWD case and 0.379 for the WD case, with maximum ratios of
   0.944 and 0.643, respectively.  Differences between these two cases are
   caused mainly by the variations of several factors such as concentration
   of oxidizable nitrogen compounds, an abundance of nitrifying organisms,
   pH and velocity and depth of water.  The hydrological conditions play an
   important role in these variations.}},

Abstract = {{u.v.-Radiation is increasingly used to disinfect drinking water.  In
   addition to an effect on microorganisms, both artificial and natural
   u.v.-radiation transforms chemicals in water.  The effect of u.v. on
   humic substances (HS) in water acquires increasing relevance because of
   the anticipated increase in global radiation, as a consequence of the
   reduced O3 content in the stratosphere.  We conducted experiments with
   typical surface water with HS.  The results show that u.v.-radiation of
   humus water changes the chemical composition of water, including acidity
   and charge density and also inhibits the growth of the alga Selenastrum
   capricornutum.  Inhibition increases with increased ``u.v.-dose{''} from
   a mercury-lamp.  The algicidal effect apparently lasts for several
   weeks.  The observed action of u.v.-treated humus water may be explained
   by photon-initiated interactions of HS and other chemicals in the water
   which results in the formation of oxidizing reagents such as OH
   radicals; these inturn oxidize organic materials by hydrogen
   abstraction.}},

Abstract = {{Although fungi play an important role in the functioning of many
   freshwater systems, information on their response to pollutants is
   scarce.  The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of
   coal-mine effluent on the structure and functioning of fungal
   assemblages.  Fungi present above and below the effluent outfall of a
   disused coal mine surveyed.  In the upstream site there were more
   species (23 compared with 20) and, possibly more importantly, twice as
   many aquatic Deuteromycotina.  It is this group of fungi, which includes
   the aquatic Hyphomycetes, that has been implicated in leaf litter
   breakdown, and litter-bag experiments confirmed that decomposition rates
   were reduced below the effluent outfall.  In addition, leaves incubated
   at the downstream site had higher C:N ratios.  Results from this study
   suggest that the mine effluent was having an effect on: the fungi
   present, the rate of leaf breakdown and the biochemical composition of
   decomposing leaves.  The implications of these effects for invertebrate
   shredders are considered.}},

   An hysteresis phenomenon was observed and discussed with respect to

   Haldane equation was adapted for predicting performance inhibition by
   undissociated acids as a function of substrate-COD and pH.  The Monod
   and adapted Haldane models were solved simultaneously with substrate
   mass balance for a UBF reactor.  The soluble COD removal efficiency and
   methane productivity were predicted as a function of the dilution rate. 
   Critical values of solid and hydraulic residence times were also
   estimated and discussed in detail.}},

Abstract = {{The concentration of dichloro- to hexachlorobenzene in the surficial
   bottom sediments in Ise Bay were determined as a preliminary study of
   the behavior of these compounds in this coastal environment.  The
   sediment samples were collected from 10 stations on the west coast and
   in Yokkaichi Port in March 1987 and from 44 stations all over the bay in
   October 1987.
   1,2- and 1,3-Dichlorobenzene and 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene
   levels were highest in the vicinity of Yokkaichi Port and Tsu-Matsuzaka
   Port.  Higher levels of these compounds were also found in the middle of
   the bay.  The concentrations of tetrachlorobenzene isomers were
   generally low but they were also higher in the vicinity of the two
   ports.  1,3,5-Trichlorobenzene was higher only in the vicinity of
   Yokkaichi.  The levels of these compounds were not higher around Nagoya
   City, the largest city in the bay.  The stations with higher dichloro-
   and trichlorobenzenes concentrations in the middle of the bay covered
   the area where the sediment particle size was small.  This was also the
   area where downward water flow was estimated to exit.  These findings
   indicated that these congeners were adsorbed by suspended particulates
   and transported by water flow.  The distribution patterns, therefore,
   could be explained by the following effects:  the distance from the
   source, the horizontal transport caused by the river inflows and the
   sedimentation caused by downward water flow.
   Pentachlorobenzene concentration was very low and its distribution was
   not clear.  Hexachlorobenzene had quite a different distribution pattern
   from other congeners, indicating that its sources were different.}},

Abstract = {{Field survey of pollutants in various environmental media is
   indispensable for modeling the behavior of organic compounds discharged
   into the coastal environment.  In this study, the concentrations of
   chlorobenzenes were measured in Ise Bay where industrial wastewater
   enters.  Some chlorobenzene congeners, 1,3-dichlorobenzene and
   1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, were detected in seawater, suspended particulate
   and bottom sediment samples and their behavior was analyzed.
   The horizontal distributions showed that these chlorobenzene
   concentrations in the surface water and sediments were higher in the
   area near the shore of the industrial area than in the offshore area. 
   The soluble chlorobenzene concentrations in the bottom water were low at
   all stations.  The vertical distribution survey at each sampling site
   showed that the soluble concentrations were high in the surface water
   and low in the bottom water, but that those in the suspended
   particulates and the bottom sediments (dry solid base) had relatively
   similar concentrations.  This indicated that chlorobenzenes in the
   bottom suspended particulates and in the bottom sediments were not
   equilibrated with chlorobenzenes in the bottom seawater.  This could be
   explained by the following chlorobenzene behavior:  the chlorobenzenes
   were adsorbed by suspended particulates in the surface water and settled
   to the bottom swiftly through less polluted seawater in the lower water
   layer with little desorption.  This caused the chlorobenzene
   concentration gradient in the bottom sediment which reflected the
   chlorobenzene concentration absorbed by suspended particulates in the
   surface water.
   The behavior of chlorobenzenes suggested in this study showed that the
   use of chemical fate models based on the assumption that the soluble
   fraction and the fraction adsorbed by suspended particulates are always
   in equilibrium may yield misleading results.}},

Abstract = {{The green alga Scenedesmus obliquus was grown in batch cultures either
   with sulfate or 1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1-NS) or both compounds as
   sulfur source.  Growth rates, pigment content and elimination rates of
   the sulfur compounds were dependent on the initial concentrations of the
   sulfur sources (K(s)-value for sulfate = 9.9-mu-M;K(s)-value for 1-NS =
   46-mu-M).  Threshold concentrations for uptake were 6.3-mu-M for sulfate
   and 38.2-mu-M for 1-NS.  When 0.014-0.140 mM of sulfate was added to the
   medium containing 0.217 mM of 1-NS, the amount of 1-NS eliminated after
   5 d was reduced in proportion to the sulfate dosage.  The calculated
   sulfur elimination rates and those obtained using S-35-labeled compounds
   agreed with one another to a large extent.  The carbon of C-14-labeled
   1-NS did not accumulate in the biomass.
   When cultivating Scenedesmus obliquus with sulfate and
   1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (1-NS) as sulfur sources in a turbidostat the
   maximum growth rate of Scenedesmus obliquus was mu = 0.107 h-1 with
   sulfate at a preset biomass concentration of 85 mg dm/1 and a maximal
   elimination of about 70\% was determined at a biomass concentration of
   1510 mg dm/1.  Growth and elimination rate were reduced when 1-NS was
   supplied as the sulfur source in the medium.  The maximum growth rate
   was only mu = 0.004 h-1 and 1-NS elimination reached 14\%.  Additional
   batch experiments showed that small amounts of sulfate had a great
   influence on growth and on elimination of 1-NS.  Pulse addition of
   sulfate to a continuous culture with 1-NS as sulfur source increased the
   growth rate 20 times and the elimination rate of 1-NS 15 times.}},

Abstract = {{pH is believed to be an important regulating factor for the release of
   phosphate from freshwater sediments.  Usually, this is demonstrated in
   laboratory experiments using intact sediment cores and pH regulation of
   the overlying water by means of NaOH additions.  This technique and a pH
   regulation technique by means of CO2-stripping were compared.  The first
   method resulted in a 10-fold increase in release rate at pH 9.5 compared
   to the rate at pH 8.3.  The stripping technique yielded only a doubling
   of the release rate at pH 9.3.  Measurements of pH profiles in the
   sediment in experiments performed at pH 8.3 and 9.0 proved that the
   enhanced phosphate release when using NaOH for pH regulation is mainly
   an artifact caused by an increased alkalinity in the water column and
   the upper sediment layers, resulting from the NaOH additions.}},

Abstract = {{Activated sludge sewage treatment plants that were affected by
   biological foams attributed to the presence of actinomycetes were
   surveyed in Queensland, Australia.  Nocardia amarae and Nocardia
   pinensis were the predominant organisms found to accumulate selectively
   in the foam phase.  Foaming was shown to be a significant problem in
   Queensland with 92\% of surveyed plants being affected.  A total of 60\%
   of these plants suffered from bulking, however, no correlation between
   these two problems was noted.  No operational, design, influent or
   weather feature was found to be consistent in all foaming plants.  Apart
   from the fact that the plants were all variations of the activated
   sludge process, the only other aspect shared by them was that large
   numbers of filamentous bacteria were present in the foam.  Field scale
   trials that evaluated control strategies against actinomycete foaming or
   scumming in activated sludge plants are described.  The effects were
   assessed of:  altering the rate of return activated sludge recycle,
   dosing of the aeration tank with anaerobic digester products, the
   addition of a commercial product specifically designed to control
   foaming, altering sludge age, varying levels of mixed liquor suspended
   solids (MLSS) and altering other operational features.  These strategies
   did not efficaciously control scumming in activated sludge, however,
   some operational features were highlighted as exacerbating the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Deuterium labelled geosmin and methylisoborneol (MIB) have been
   synthesized and evaluated as internal standards in the determination of
   geosmin and MIB in water by closed loop stripping followed by gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).  The labelled standards were
   compared with chloroalkanes added as internal standards either at the
   time of sampling or immediately before closed loop stripping.  When
   added at sampling time, the new standards enabled accurate determination
   of the geosmin and MIB present initially, even when the samples were
   analysed as much as 3 weeks later.  The new standards gave better
   precision and accuracy than the chloroalkanes and overcame the
   underestimation of initial analyte concentration which usually results
   from losses of analyte through adsorption, volatilisation,
   biodegradation etc. during sample storage.  Geosmin had a limit of
   detection of < 0.1 ng/l and 1 ng/l was determined with a coefficient of
   variation (CV) of 1.2\% (n = 5).  MIB was determined at 1 ng/l with a CV
   of 3.5\% (n = 5).}},

Abstract = {{Microbiological denitrification in a sandy matrix was studied by means
   of laboratory sand columns operated at continuous and pulse feed
   regimes.  Gas production resulting from the biological activity played a
   major role in modifying the hydraulic properties of the column, leading
   to decreases in hydraulic conductivity and porosity, higher water
   velocities through the column, higher dispersion and anomalies in the
   head difference to flow rates ratios.  All of these effects were more
   pronounced when formate, the carbon source used, was supplied
   continuously:  microbial activity and gas production were concentrated
   at the top of the column, leading to almost complete clogging.  When the
   formate was supplied in pulses, activity and gas production were
   dispersed, leading to relative uniformity in the physical parameters
   measured and a homogeneous appearance of the column.  The results
   suggest that in a future in situ aquifer denitrification plant, pulse
   application of the carbon source is prefereable to a continuous supply
   regime.}},

Abstract = {{Macroinvertebrate populations including Gammarus pulex and Asellus
   aquaticus were surveyed at riffle sites on four lowland rivers, i.e. the
   Rivers Adur and Ouse and the Chess Stream, Sussex, and the Eridge
   Stream, Kent.  Sites were situated both upstream and downstream of
   sewage treatment works.  Macroinvertebrates were collected using a
   Surber sampler and at some sites the water analysed for the main
   chemical constituents.
   Poor water quality is characteristically associated with low biotic
   scores and in this respect the Gammarus:Asellus ratio applied to riffle
   data corresponded with the Chandler Biotic Score Index and the Extended
   Trent Biotic Index.  The Gammarus:Asellus ratio showed the closest
   correlations with concentrations of BOD, ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N),
   nitrite-nitrogen (NO2-N) and phosphate-phosphorus (PO4-P) being
   sensitive to changes in water quality brought about by organic
   enrichment in the four rivers investigated.
   It is proposed that the Gammarus:Asellus ratio may provide a simple
   biological tool which could be used by anglers and other
   non-professional river users to routinely monitor water quality.}},

Abstract = {{The acute toxicity (LC50) of dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) was
   determined to be 28 mg/l in rainbow trout.  A static non-replacement
   exposure of rainbow trout to C-14-labeled DSS was used to measure the
   bioaccumulation and elimination of DSS within four separate body
   compartments:  blood, bile, viscera and carcass.  The trout were exposed
   for 72 h followed by a 72 h period for depuration.  Tissue samples were
   analyzed at 2, 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h during both the exposure and
   depuration phases of the experiment.  Using scintillation counting, DSS
   concentrations were measured in tissues and used to calculate uptake
   rate constants, bioconcentration factors, elimination rate constants and
   half-lives of DSS elimination for each body compartment.  The greatest
   rate of appearance of DSS was in the bile of the trout, while the
   slowest uptake occurred within the carcass.  Elimination of DSS from the
   carcass and viscera of the trout was found to follow second order
   kinetics and elimination from the blood and bile followed first order
   kinetics.  The evaluation of {[}C-14]DSS metabolism was conducted using
   the HPLC analysis of biliary metabolities following an intraperitoneal
   injection.  Two major peaks were found containing C-14 that were not
   associated with the parent DSS peak.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbon adsorption isotherms were determined experimentally for
   mixtures containing specific synthetic organics and, in some instances,
   relatively uncharacterized background dissolved organic matter.  Ideal
   adsorbed solution theory (IAST) was used to predict and/or describe
   competitive equilibria.  Two models, the well-known Freundlich equation
   and an empirical three-parameter equation developed for this work, were
   used to describe single solute equilibria.  As expected, the
   three-parameter model was able to more accurately describe single solute
   isotherms which deviated from log-log linearity.  Comparisons were made
   of IAST calculations performed with the Freundlich versus the
   three-parameter equation and yielded mixed results, the interpretation
   of which may be influenced by the method chosen to quantify the goodness
   of fit.  The system studied also exhibited variability in the degree of
   ideality with respect to solute-solute competition as evaluated by IAST.
   A modeling methodology which evaluated equilibrium parameters and
   modeled data in terms of the target compounds only provided a
   quantitative assessment of the impacts of unknown organic background on
   the adsorption capacity of the target species.}},

Abstract = {{Wet air oxidation (WAO) of aqueous solutions of phenol and substituted
   phenols namely, omicron-, m- and p-chlorophenols, omicron-, m-cresols,
   omicron- and p-methoxyphenols, omicron-ethylphenol and
   2,6-dimethylphenol, were carried out.  The process was studied in a 1
   litre stainless steel autoclave at temperatures in the range of
   150-180-degrees-C.  The oxygen partial pressure was varied from 0.3 to
   1.5 MPa and the initial phenol concentration was 200 mg/l.
   The oxidation of phenols in water involves a free-radical mechanism and
   proceeds in two steps.  The oxidation reaction was found to be first
   order in oxygen and also first order with respect to phenolic substrates
   in both steps.  The values of activation energy were found to be in the
   range of 12.4 x 10(3)-201 x 10(3) kJ/kmol.  The conditions have been
   found under which the overall oxidation reaction becomes reaction
   controlled or mass transfer controlled.  The values of mass transfer
   coefficient have been obtained.  The data based on bench scale shows wet
   air oxidation of phenols can achieve destruction efficiencies exceeding
   99.9\%.  The reduction of COD during oxidation of all phenols was also
   measured.  Greater than 90\% COD reduction was achieved.  Some aspects
   of the process design of the oxidation reactor have been discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A semi-automated method for colorimetric and enzymatic assays using a
   microplate reader has been developed. This method enables simultaneous
   assays of an extended number of colorimetric measurements of protein
   concentration, and acetylcholinesterase activity in organisms. The
   correlation coefficient of the results obtained by conventional methods
   using a spectrophotometer and those obtained using a microplate reader
   was 0.98 for acetyl cholinesterase and 0.99 for protein determination.
   The variation coefficient for all assays was lower than 7\%. The method
   is useful for fast determination of protein concentration and enzymatic
   measurements including inhibition studies and calculation of kinetic
   parameters. Three advantages are featured in comparison with classical
   methods. First is the possibility of hundreds of measurements within
   time periods ranging from minutes to hours. The second advantage is the
   low cost of the system and the third is the reduced volume of the system
   that enables the system to work on-board during a scientific cruise or
   to be decentralized. The limits of the methods and the possible
   developments are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the mechanisms of the biological activated carbon
   (BAC) process.  It is found that the bioregeneration hypothesis of
   desorption by exonenzymatic reactions is the common basis for some
   previous mechanisms.  But by considering properties of the enzymes
   involved in the biodegradation pathway of phenols and aromatic
   hydrocarbons and distribution of exoenzymes in carbon pores, it is
   suggested that the hypothesis is not valid in most circumstances.  A
   series of tests has been made in which phenol was used as the testing
   pollutant.  The BAC column test was performed to investigate the changes
   in carbon adsorption capacity during operation.  Properties of biolgical
   activity in BAC were measured by a Warburg respirometer.  A comparative
   test between the BAC bed reactor and biological aerated filters was also
   made.  All test results were contradictory to the mechanisms based on
   the bioregeneration hypothesis and supported the authors' suggestion
   that the mechanism of the BAC process is basically a simple combination
   of biodegradation and carbon adsorption.  It is suggested that some
   specially designed biological aerated filter (BAF), instead of a BAC bed
   reactor, may be used in advanced wastewater treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatic cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase activities of fish,
   especially 7-ethylresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD activity) have
   been proposed as possible indicators of water pollution.  Nevertheless
   there is a need for comparisons between different methods of storage and
   of subcellular fractionation of the liver with regard to absolute
   activity and responsiveness of EROD activity to pollution.  In this
   report the livers of nase (Chondrostoma nasus) were collected in
   PCB-polluted and reference areas of the River Rhone.  They were stored
   in liquid nitrogen either after slicing or after homogenization in
   phosphate buffer containing 20\% glycerol; subcellular fractionations
   were performed at the laboratory.  Results demonstrate the deleterious
   effect of freezing slices of liver on EROD activity and point out the
   protective effect of homogenizing in buffer containing 20\% glycerol (a
   cryoprotector) prior freezing.  Besides, we observed a 3-fold higher
   EROD activity in the microsomal fraction as compared to
   postmitochondrial fraction, demonstrating the interest of subcellular
   fractionation to increase the sensitivity of the assay.  Finally, we did
   not notice any difference between methods of storage and of subcellular
   preparation with regard to the rate of induction of EROD activity
   between polluted and reference areas.  We conclude that in most cases
   postmitochondrial fraction originating from liver homogenized in buffer
   containing 20\% glycerol prior freezing in liquid nitrogen is a useful
   preparation to measure EROD activity as a pollution indicator.}},

   fishes from the lakes of Bhopal was carried out over a period of 6
   months with bimonthly observations.  The concentration of the

   lakes of Bhopal was estimated.  On each occasion it was found to
   indicate a decreasing trend.  However, a depth-wise increase of
   concentration of monomethlamine was observed in the Lower Lake. 
   Bioaccumulation of monomethylamine was also estimated in different
   tissues of various species of fishes, collected from the Lower and Upper
   Lakes of Bhopal and from Aligarh.  Among all the species of fishes
   available in the Lower Lake of Bhopal, Puntius ticto was found to be the
   most susceptible to MIC-poisoning.  There is a change in the values of
   pH, ammonia-nitrogen and urea-nitrogen concentrations in the Lower Lake
   water.  The cholinesterase activities of different tissues of various

Abstract = {{Difficulties in measuring in situ pH in dilute acidified lakes have
   often resulted in an assumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide
   equilibrium to compute this pH. Unfortunately, the sensitivity of pH to
   carbon dioxide content of dilute waters is high. The results of our
   experimental study show the carbon dioxide equilibrium is seldom
   attained in a dilute lake. As a result, invoking an atmospheric
   equilibrium assumption can lead to pH estimation errors of greater than
   one (1) pH unit at pH = 6. A more accurate method to estimate in situ pH
   is presented. The method uses measured acid neutralizing capacity and
   total inorganic carbon. Contribution of humic substances to acid
   neutralizing capacity is taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{Two surface water sources in the southwestern United States were studied

   Both source waters contained bromide (Br-) leading to brominated THMs

   by dissolved organic carbon (DOC), while having little effect on
   bromide.  The net result was an increase in the ratio of Br-/DOC and an
   increase in the relative abundance of brominated THMs.  Ozone oxidized
   higher molecular weight precursor molecules into lower molecular weight
   by-products which were less reactive with chlorine.  Moreover, ozonation
   appeared to transform Br- to hypobromous acid (an in situ oxidant),

Abstract = {{Bench-scale batch anaerobic degration of lactate and acetate was
   investigated using three sets of serum bottles.  All serum bottles were
   fed 1g1(-1) COD and 15.6 mM (1.5 g1(-1) SO(4)2- at the start of the
   experiment.  Set one (S(L)) used lactic acid, set two (S(A)) used acetic
   acid, and set three (S(M)) used a 1:1 mixture on a COD basis of the two
   organic acids.  Each set consisted of 10 serum bottles of which 5 were
   started at a pH of 7 and 5 at a pH of 8.  Each pH subset reactor had a
   different initial total sulfide (TS) concentration, which varied from
   3.13 to 31.3 mM (100-1000mg1(-1)).  Acetate removal followed first order
   reaction kinetics and proceeded without any significant sulfate
   reduction.  Inhibition of acetate removal by aqueous hydrogen sulfide
   (H2S) was modeled using an exponential function.  Both propionate
   removal and sulfate reduction were inhibited proportionally to the
   concentration of TS.  This suggests a crucial role for the sulfate
   reducing bacteria in mediating propionate degradation to acetate.  In
   the low pH subset of S(M), complete inhibition of sulfate reduction
   occurred at only 17\% inhibition of methanogenesis.  Complete COD
   removal occurred in all the serum bottles of the high pH subsets,
   indicating the important role of H2S in sulfide inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{The bacterial process of metal solubilization from sewage sludges was
   studied using two types of reactors:  a continuously stirred tank
   reactor (CSTR) and an airlift reactor, with partial sludge recycling in
   each case.  Both reactors showed similar metal solubilization
   efficiencies.  After parameter optimization and steady state were
   obtained, a mean hydraulic residence time (tBAR) of 0.75 day allowed
   91\% Cu, 94\% Zn, 93\% Mn, 67\% Ni and 67\% Cd solubilization in the
   CSTR while 89\% Cu, 91\% Zn and 82\% Cd were solubilized in the airlift
   reactor.  The equation r(v) = 1.23 C + 0.44, expressing the
   solubilization rate of Cu or Zn according to their respective
   concentrations, had an explained variance (r2) of 0.93 for tBAR = 0.75
   d.  This equation applies equally to the CSTR and to the airlift, thus
   showing the equality of the efficiency of either reactor.  A significant
   first order kinetic equation has been formulated for each tBAR.  These
   results represent a 4:1 reduction of the required tBAR in comparison to
   tBAR used in earlier work and 0.75 day is therefore an optimum mean
   hydraulic residence time for bacterial leaching of metals from anaerobic
   sewage sludge.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption isotherms of three trihalomethanes (THMs) involving CHCl3,
   CHBrCl2 and CHBr2Cl on activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were measured. 
   Adsorption capacities of the ACFs for these THMs were found to be
   comparable with or slightly larger than those of granular activated
   carbons (GACs) which have been widely used for trihalomethane control in
   drinking water.  Also, the breakthrough curve prediction was
   successfully carried out using a mathematical model on the basis of the
   assumption that the adsorption equilibrium in instantaneously
   established when a THM solution contacts the ACF.  In practice, THM
   removal from drinking water was investigated at water works using
   bench-scale ACF adsorption columns.  The volume of water treated at a
   space velocity (SV) of about 100 h-1 was approx. 40 1 (g-ACF)-1.}},

Abstract = {{Biomethylation of Se in evaporation pond water was studied and optimized
   in laboratory-incubated mesocosms.  Methylating microorganisms were
   present in all pond waters collected from the San Joaquin Valley, Calif.
   and were inhibited by bactericides (10 mg 1(-1) crystal violet, 100 mg
   1(-1) penicillin G, and a 1:1 mixture of 50 mg1(-1) penicillin G and 50
   mg 1(-1) polymyxin B sulfate), but not by fungicides (200 mg 1(-1)
   cycloheximide, 200 mg 1(-1) nystatin and 50 mg 1(-1) sodium dichromate).
   The addition of casein (4 g 1(-1)) increased bacterial numbers 1000-fold
   and stimulated biomethylation 25-fold.  The provision of growth matrices
   (sand, glass beads or nylon polymers) stimulated Se biomethylation in
   unamended water but not in peptone-amended water.  Biomethylation was
   optimal in a well-mixed, aerobic system amended with a protein source. 
   Cofactors (10-mu-M homocysteine and 10-mu-M reduced glutathione)
   enhanced the production of dimethylselenide in peptone-amended pond
   water.  The species of inorganic Se present, SeO(3)2- and SeO(4)2- had
   little effect on the methylation efficiency.  Increasing the Se
   concentration to 1.9, 3.9, 11.9, 21.9 or 101.9 mg Se 1(-1) in
   peptone-amended pond water decreased the percentage of Se removed from 8
   to 3.8, 2, 1.3, 0.7 and 0.1\%, respectively.  Selenium removal ranged
   between 8 and 100\% for peptone-amended pond waters containing between
   2.2 and 0.02-mu-g Se 1(-1), respectively.  Biomethylation was inibited
   by 0.1 M NO3- and NO2- but additional SO(4)2- (0.1, 1 M) had no effect
   on DMSe release.  It may be possible to apply these findings in the
   design of a bioreactor to deselenify agricultural drainage water.}},

Abstract = {{The aerobic biogradation of a mixture of 22 phenols, N-heterocycles and
   aromatic amines was studied in a model wastewater containing these
   components as sole carbon source.  A mixed culture was isolated from
   soil, adapted to continuous flow conditions and immobilized on fluidized
   particles of sand or activated carbon.  During long-term experiments in
   an airlift-loop reactor, dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC)
   of the medium were varied between 125 and 1000 mg/l and the dilution
   rate between 0.25 and 0.78 h-1.  DOC removal in the sand system was
   constant with values fluctuating between 59 and 69\%.  Biomass
   concentration first increased in proportion to the volumetric DOC
   loading rate, but reached a plateau at loading rates above 200 mg/l.h
   with values fluctuating around 4.4 g/l.  With activated carbon the
   biomass concentration was higher under the same conditions, but DOC
   removal decreased during operation down to a final value of 39\%.  It
   was assumed that biodegradation is superimposed by adsorption of organic
   matter up to the saturation of the carbon.  Only a minor part of the
   biomas was immobilized on the coal particles, while the major part was
   aggregated as flocs and pellets.  The low metabolic activity of the
   activated carbon system is ascribed to inhibitory effects of
   by-products.  Gas chromatographic analysis of individual components
   revealed that the feed components were nearly completely degraded in
   both systems, but evidence was found for the formation of dead-end

Abstract = {{Polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria of activated sludge from sewage
   plants can remove and store phosphorus from wastewater in different,
   specific ways:  Acinetobacter strains with enhanced phosphorus
   accumulation stored polyphosphate inside the cell as cytoplasmic
   inclusions.  Moraxella (strain St-8) stored polyphosphate
   intracytoplasmically, as well as in the periplasm.  In addition, this
   strain could fix phosphate on the cell surface in high concentrations
   already at pH values below pH 8.0.  This phosphate could be washed off
   by Tris-HCl buffer.  From these results, we conclude that in sewage
   plants phosphorus is also fixed in different ways in or on the biomass
   during the biological removal of excess phosphorus in the activated
   sludge process.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates that long-term changes in water velocity
   affected the amount of biofilm biomass associated with a sand-free
   cobble streambed.  Streambed biofilms were grown and acclimated to
   several different water velocities in an artificial stream.  The rate at
   which each acclimated biofilm removed substrate from the water column
   was assessed by performing well-controlled, batch biodegradation tests. 
   Substrate removal rates for each tested acclimation velocity were
   corrected for mass transport effects.  Any differences in the
   mass-transport-corrected removal rates for the acclimated biofilms were
   due to variations in streambed biofilm biomass.  Experimental results
   indicated that higher streambed biofilm biomass levels were found at the
   faster acclimation velocities.  Such results imply that the rate of
   biodegradable contaminant removal in shallow biofilm-dominated streams
   is a function of the present water velocity (determines mass transport
   regime) and historical water velocities (determines streambed biofilm
   biomass levels).}},

Abstract = {{Correlation of tricholoroethylene (TCE) vapor partition coefficients (at
   P/P0 < 2\%) onto seven sorbents with selected properties showed that: 
   (1) under oven-dried conditions, specific surface area best described
   sorption of TCE and (2) under air-dried conditions (68\% r.h.), at field
   capacity and for saturated conditions, organic carbon content controlled
   sorption.  The change in the dependency of TCE vapor partition
   coefficients, from specific surface area at oven-dried conditions to
   organic carbon content at air-dried conditions, is hypothesized to
   result from:  (1) reduced sorption of TCE onto mineral surfaces because
   of competition with water and (2) increased importance of partitioning
   into organic matter.  At field capacity, the sorption of TCE vapor can
   be accounted for by two contributions:  (1) dissolution of TCE in the
   water bound to the sorbent as governed by Henry's law and (2) sorption
   of TCE at the solid-liquid interface as governed by a saturated
   partition coefficient.  Dissolution of TCE into surface-bound water can
   constitute a large fraction of the total TCE uptake from the vapor phase
   for sorbents with low organic carbon content.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to evaluate the microbial quality and safety of
   graywater for reuse purposes.  The microbial and chemical composition of
   graywater from shower/bath, wash cycle and rinse cycle of a clothes
   washing machine was determined.  Graywater composed from all sources
   within a house was also monitored each week over a 2-3-month time
   period.  Samples were taken from a diverse group of families with
   children (18 months-9 years of age) and without children.  Standard
   plate count bacteria (SPC) ranged from 10(5) to 10(10) colony forming
   units (cfu) per 100 ml for shower and bath water, and an average of
   10(4) to 10(6) cfu per 100 ml for total coliforms.  Families with small
   children produced wash cycle graywater containing 10(6) cfu per 100 ml
   of fecal coliforms.  During investigations on storage of graywater, it
   was found that total bacterial SPC and coliform bacteria increased one
   order of magnitude.  Salmonella atyphimurium and Shigella dysenteriae
   seeded into graywater were found to persist for at least several days. 
   Poliovirus type 1 added to graywater decreased 99 and 90\% at 25 and
   17-degrees-C, respectively, after 6 d of storage in graywater.  These
   data imply that there may be some risk associated with reuse of
   graywater when these pathogenic bacteria or viruses are being excreted
   by an individual producing the graywater.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional water treatment usually begins with rapid dispersal of
   chemical coagulant(s) into raw water followed by vigorous agitation. 
   This process, commonly referred to as initial or rapid mixing, is
   influenced by several parameters, both physical and chemical.  The paper
   presents a brief review of literature on coagulation-flocculation of
   turbid waters with special reference to the kinetics of rapid mix.  In
   the light of the limitations of previous research, a rational approach
   for optimizing the physical parameters of rapid mix is presented.  The
   optimum combination of velocity gradient, time of rapid mix and

Title = {{OXYGEN-TRANSFER IN TRICKLING FILTERS}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{53-60}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Very little is known about oxygen transfer in trickling filters.  Oxygen
   transfer in trickling filters must be studied in correlation with
   hydrodynamics.  We suggest a method to quantify oxygen transfer in such
   a system.  The hydrodynamics is studied using a random plastic media
   when it is clean and when it is covered with biomass.  Concerning oxygen
   transfer, different equations may be proposed depending on the hydraulic
   model:  plug flow or axial dispersion.  These equations must be solved
   by successive iterations to find the oxygen transfer coefficient and
   finally the oxygen transfer performance expressed in kgO2/kWh.  Another
   way to quantify gas transfer in the presence of biochemical reaction is
   to utilize a tracer gas.  Propane was used in our experiments.  On clean
   media the results give an oxygen transfer performance of 2 kg O2/kWh. 
   The results are similar for the plug flow model and for the axial
   dispersion model.  When the biomass respiration is endogeneous, the
   oxygen balance on the tower results in a much greater oxygen transfer
   performance, the minimum calculated is 22 kg O2/kWh.  We must consider
   that in this case oxygen transfer is amplified, by around a factor of
   10, due to biomass respiration.  Unfortunately there is another fact
   that seems contradictory to those experimental measurements.  The liquid
   at the outlet of the tower is generally saturated with oxygen.  This
   state of saturation should be incompatible with an enhancement factor
   for oxygen transfer greater than 1.  Our explanation is proposed based
   on hydrodynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Hexavalent chromium, which is frequently encountered in the tannery
   effluents and in the electroplating wastes, is normally considered toxic
   to the activated sludge culture.  Often a physico-chemical pretreatment
   prior to biological treatment is considered necessary.  However, in this
   study it has been shown that an acclimatized activated sludge culture is
   fully capable of coping with the Cr(VI)-containing wastes and moreover
   the culture was significantly stimulated by up to 25 mg l-1 Cr(VI). 
   None of the tested concentrations of this metal were inhibitory to the
   mixed culture under investigation.  In fact, all of the concentrations
   tested, 1, 5, 10 and 25 mg l-1 Cr(VI), significantly stimulated the
   maximum growth rate, mu-m, of the culture.  Furthermore, the biomass
   yield of the activated sludge culture markedly increased in the presence
   of Cr(VI) while the effect on the biomass decay or maintenance constants
   was variable.}},

Abstract = {{Water parcels of different chemical composition were detected in a 1 m
   thick and up to 17 m/d fast-flowing groundwater system using a
   multi-layer sampler based on the dialysis cell technique.  The parcels
   result from the infiltration of sewage effluents and also probably due
   to the leaching of sewage sludge from the agricultural land surface. 
   Samples obtained a depth intervals as small as 3 cm in a natural
   gradient flow field revealed relative high concentrations and variable
   vertical profiles of Na+, NO3-, HCO3-, SO4(2-) and DOC 9 m downstream of
   the infiltration pipe.  A pump used to obtain water samples during a 2
   year period, in the same research field, proved to be an inadequate
   sampling technique to trace the movement of sewage effluent.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{An experimental study was conducted to investigate the use of ozone to
   dechlorinate chlorendic acid
   {[}1,4,5,6,7,7-hexachlorobicyclo-(2,2,1)-hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic
   acid; CAS Number 115-28-6].  The dechlorination and subsequent
   degradation of chlorendic acid by ozonation is influenced by the pH,
   applied ozone dose and bicarbonate concentration.  A change in the
   initial chlorendic acid concentration to 50, 100 and 200 mg/l did not
   influence the rate of degradation of chlorendic acid.  Ultraviolet
   radiation alone also dechlorinated chlorendic acid.  Ultraviolet
   radiation (u.v.) was also shown to greatly enhance the oxidation of
   chlorendic acid in the presence of ozone.  In a typical case, 80\%
   dechlorination of chlorendic acid was obtained in 60 min when using an
   ozone dose of 125 mg/min ozone at pH 7.4.  In addition to the
   experimental results, a model describing the dechlorination of
   chlorendic acid is presented.  The pseudo-first order rate constants for
   a two-step model were calculated and ranged from 0.002 to 0.295 min-1
   for the first step and 0.008 to 6 x 10(12) min-1 (calculated) for the
   second step.  The magnitude of the rate constants and corresponding
   rates of dechlorination of chlorendic acid were shown to be dependent
   upon the production and/or scavenging of hydroxyl radicals in solution. 
   Conditions favoring radicals in solution, such as high pH and the
   addition of u.v., resulted in much faster dechlorination.  The
   conditions which did not favor radicals, such as low pH and the addition
   of bicarbonate, resulted in slower dechlorination.}},

Abstract = {{The synthetic resin Amberlite IR-120 in the Na+ form (10 cm3), and the
   naturally occurring zeolite, clinoptilolite, (20 cm3) have been found to

   ionic strength up to 10(-2) M NaCl.  Elution by 150 cm3 2.7 M NaCl
   removes the TriML back into solution, from where it can be extracted,
   derivatized with propyl Grignard reagent and analyzed by GC-AAS.  TriML
   is stable for at least 24 h on the ion-exchange media.  The method
   allows the sampling and determination of TriML in natural and
   wastewaters with a detection limit of 0.1 ng (Pb) dm-3.  It may also be
   used for the decontamination of wastewaters.  This technique may be

Abstract = {{There are no detailed data concerning the carbon load of inflow rivers,
   in spite of carbon being one of the most important elements in closed
   water areas.  The authors have therefore conducted weekly observations
   on four rivers flowing into lakes during a 1-year period.  A remarkable
   statistical characteristic for input loads of carbon, nitrogen and
   phosphorus, from the four river basins, was their dependence on
   discharge.  Loads of three elements in the inflow rivers to Lake
   Kasumigaura were measured by four seasonal observations in the year. 
   The TOC:T-N:T-P ratios of inflow nutrients were 27-45:8-32:1 using both
   arithmetic and discharge-weighted mean concentrations.  The TOC:T-N:T-P
   ratios for the whole of the lake and for a bay receiving inflow from
   three rivers were estimated on the basis of monthly observations.  Most
   of the inflow loads of particulate nutrients were deposited in the river
   mouth, whereas the inflow loads of dissolved nutrients and
   production-degradation processes of organic matter largely controlled
   the nutrient budget in the lake water by comparison of the ratios for
   surface mud, phytoplankton and detritus.}},

   REVIEW AND RISK ASSESSMENT}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{25}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Surfactants are one of the major components (10-18\%) of detergent and
   household cleaning products and are used in high volumes.  Several are
   commonly found in natural waters and consequently, their impact on the
   environment has been, and continues to be, discussed in the U.S.A.,
   Western Europe and Japan.  The chronic and sublethal toxicities of
   commercially important surfactants to aquatic animal life have not been
   summarized in the available scientific literature.  Based on the summary
   provided here scientific understanding of the chronic and sublethal
   toxicities of cationic surfactants is less than that for the other
   surfactant groups.  Chronic toxicity of anionic and nonionic surfactants
   occurs at concentrations usually greater than 0.1 mg/l.  Effects of
   these same surfactants on several behavioral and physiological
   parameters range from 0.002 to 40.0 mg/l.  The available toxicity data
   base is largely comprised of laboratory-derived toxicity data for a few
   surfactants, predominantly LAS, and single freshwater planktonic species
   such as Daphnia magna and the fathead minnow and a benthic midge. 
   Community effect levels have been reported only for linear alkylbenzene
   sulfonate (LAS) and effects on single freshwater and saltwater test
   species and on natural biotic communities are largely unknown for many
   commercially important surfactants.  Based on a comparison of the
   reported chronic toxicity data and measured environmental levels in
   rivers, the aquatic safety of the anionic LAS is indicated, more so than
   for any other surfactant.  Safety assessments for other major
   surfactants in saltwater and freshwater should be considered preliminary
   and limited until validated with corresponding exposure measurements and
   additional laboratory and field-derived chronic toxicity data for animal
   test species.}},
