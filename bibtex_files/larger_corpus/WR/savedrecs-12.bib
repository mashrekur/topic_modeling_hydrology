Abstract = {{Ferrihydrite is an excellent adsorbent for binding trace toxic
   contaminants such as arsenic, and precipitate flotation of the
   arsenic-bearing ferrihydrite has been studied. Anionic surfactants such
   as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium oleate (NaOL) are suitable
   collectors for the flotiition. The adsorption of SLS both alone and
   after the subsequent addition of NaOL on these precipitates at pH 4-5
   was measured. It has been shown that the synergistic effect of the two
   surfactants on notation is dependent on their addition order. The
   presence of NaOL before SLS in the conditioning stage call prevent the
   adsorption of SLS because of the electrostatic shielding of adsorption
   sites on the precipitates. The post addition of NaOL to the SLS-bearing
   precipitates can promote the flocculation of the precipitates and
   enhance entrainment of SLS for better Rotation. The SLS adsorption data
   fit better with the modified Frumkin isotherm than the Langmuir
   isotherm. Thermodynamic parameters (-DeltaG(ads)degrees,
   DeltaH(ads)degrees, and DeltaS(ads)degrees) have been derived from the
   analysis of the adsorption isotherms. The results suggest that the
   adsorption of SLS on AFH is physical and exothermic. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Foul condensates originating from the I(raft recovery process contain

   a reduction of the total phenols concentration below 1 mg/L as well as a
   substantial toxicity drop as measured using the Microtox(R) assay,
   however, only marginal COD removal was achieved. Comparisons of
   treatments between synthetic wastewaters and real wastewaters to which
   phenol were added revealed that the condensate contained species that
   protect the enzyme from inactivation by reaction products. Analytical

Abstract = {{We have proposed a new recovery system of hexavalent chromium Cr(VI)
   that is of great toxicity utilizing condensed-tannin gels derived from a
   natural polymer with many polyhydroxyphenyl groups. The adsorption
   mechanism of Cr(VI) to the tannin molecules was clarified. The
   adsorption mechanism consists of four reaction steps; the esterification
   of chromate with tannin molecules, the reduction of Cr(VI) to trivalent
   chromium Cr(III), the formation of carboxyl group by the oxidation of
   tannin molecules and the ion exchange of the reduced Cr(III) with the
   carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. It was found in this recovery system that
   a large amount of proton was consumed accompanied with the reduction of
   Cr(VI) so that the acidic solution containing Cr(VI) was transferred
   automatically to neutral one by choosing an appropriate initial pH. The
   carboxyl group which was created by the oxidation of tannin molecules
   parallel to the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) contributed to an
   increase in the ion-exchange sites of the reduced Cr(III). The maximum
   adsorption capacity of Cr(VI) reached 287 mg Cr/g dry tannin gel under
   the conditions of 0.77 water content of tannin gel and the initial pH =
   2. This adsorption capacity was five to ten times higher than that
   obtained by the ion exchange between ordinary Cr(III) and tannin
   molecules for the tannin gels prepared under similar conditions. The
   system proposed here will provide an important information on a
   zero-emission-oriented process because it has such advantages as higher
   adsorption capacity of chromium and lower volume of secondary wastes
   compared with conventional process. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Six tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay were analyzed for suspended
   particulate matter. dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic
   carbon, mercury, methylmercury, lead. nickel, zinc, cadmium, chromium,
   and copper. This study examined the importance of flow regime, suspended
   particulate concentration, and watershed characteristics on the
   transport of mercury, methylmercury, and other trace metals. Total
   mercury concentrations were higher under high how conditions which is
   consistent with the tendency of this metal to bind strongly to
   particulate matter, Methylmercury showed less flow rate dependence.
   Nickel, lead, and zinc concentrations responded strongly to flow rate on
   the Potomac River; while weaker correlations were found on the other
   rivers sampled. Cadmium, copper, and chromium concentrations were the
   least influenced by flow. Partition coefficients calculated in this
   study were similar to those of other estuaries and overall decreased in
   the order of Hg > Ni-MMHg > Cr-Pb-Zn > Cd > Cu. Watershed yield
   estimates and associated retention factors were calculated for the
   various rivers. These calculations showed that for most of the rivers,
   mercury was the most strongly retained within the watershed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Rapid small-scale minicolumn tests were carried out to simulate the
   atrazine adsorption in water phase with three palletized pitch-based
   activated carbon fibers (ACF) and one commercial granular activated
   carbon (GAC). Initial atrazine solutions were prepared with pretreated
   ground water. Minicolumn tests showed that the performance of highly
   activated carbon fibers (surface area of 1700 m(2)/g) is around 7 times
   better than the commercial GAC (with surface area at around 1100
   m(2)/g), whereas carbon fibers with medium activation degree (surface
   area of 1500 m(2)/g) had a removal efficiency worse than the commercial
   carbon. The high removal efficiency of the highly activated ACF is due
   to the wide-opened microstructure of the material, with an appreciable
   contribution of the low size mesopores, maintaining at these conditions
   a fast kinetic adsorption rate rather than a selective adsorbent for
   micropollutants vs. natural organic matter. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Experiments performed on ``Marais{''} catchment, in central Paris, aimed
   to follow up the duality of wet weather Rows from the entry to the exit
   of a combined sewer network. SS, VSS, GOD, BOD5, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn
   concentrations were measured for an important number of rain events in
   roof, yard, street runoff, as well as in dry and wet weather flows at
   the catchment outlet. Mass entry-exit totals, at the scale of the
   catchment, were calculated over 31 rain events in order to evaluate the
   contribution of different types of runoff, of sanitary sewage and of
   sewer sediments to the total wet weather pollutant loads at the
   catchment outlet. The erosion of in-sewer pollutant stocks was found to
   be the main source of particles and of organic matter in wet weather
   flows, whereas heavy metal loads mainly originated from roof runoff due
   to the corrosion of metallic roofs. Particles eroded inside the sewer
   during rain events were found to be quite different from the particles
   constituting the main part of sewer sediments: they are organic and
   biodegradable, with rather important settling velocities and seem to
   accumulate during dry weather periods. A change of the chemical form of
   heavy metals was noticed during the transport in the sewer and it is
   suspected that a fraction of the dissolved metals from the runoff is
   adsorbed on sewer sediments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Dried waste slurry generated in seafood processing factories has been
   shown to be an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from
   dilute solutions. Characterization of the sludge surface with scanning
   electron microscope and X-ray microanalyzer were carried out to evaluate
   the components on the sludge surface that are related to the adsorption
   of metal ions. Aluminum and calcium, as well as organic carbon are
   distributed on the surface of sludge. Alkalimetric titration was used to
   characterize the surface acidity of the sludge sample. The surface
   acidity constants, pK(a1)(s) and pK(a2)(s) were 5.50 and 9.55,
   respectively. Batch as well as dynamic adsorption studies were conducted
   with 10 to 5 x 10(-3) M Cu(II) and Cd(II). A surface complexation model
   with the diffuse layer model successfully predicted Cu(II) and Cd(II)
   removals in single metal solutions. Predictions of sorption in
   binary-adsorbate systems based on single-adsorbate data fits represented
   competitive sorption data reasonably well over a wide range of
   conditions. The breakthrough capacity found from column studies was
   different for each metal ion and the data reflect the order of metal
   affinity for the adsorbent material very well, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The frequent occurrence of reoviruses in environmental samples could be
   a potential source of interference with enterovirus detection,
   especially when enterovirus isolation on cell culture is required. In
   order to evaluate new virus-based criteria for enforcing recreational
   water quality standards, a new method based on a broad reverse
   transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was set up to detect
   reoviruses. Two primers were engineered to amplify a 538 base pair
   fragment of the Sigma 2 gene. Reovirus strains obtained from ATCC
   (Jones, Lang, Dearing, Abney, NC-TEV, SV59 and SV12) were used as
   references. Twenty-four samples of 101 were collected from two beaches
   of the Adriatic sea and 12 from the neighbourhood of Fano Harbour
   Channel. The presence of environmental reoviruses was tested on both
   concentrated seawater samples and lysates of BGM cells infected with the
   concentrated seawater samples. The new method was used in parallel with
   the detection of a 3:3:4 electrophoretic pattern of reovirus RNA in
   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (FAGE). Enterovirus and bacteria were
   also screened in compliance with EEC directives. No enteroviruses were
   isolated, and it was not attributable to reovirus interference. All the
   reovirus found by PAGE (8/72) were confirmed by RT-PCR, while several
   genomes (14/72) were detected only by RT-PCR. Presumptive methods of
   virus identification, that is CPE on BGM cells and haemagylutination
   test, were not able to detect them. The specificity of RT-PCR products
   was checked by direct nucleotide sequence analyses of the amplicons. The
   phylogenetic analyses showed heterogeneous taxa including human and
   animal reoviruses, with strong evidence that they were spreading
   consistently from the Harbour-Channel. This novel approach for reovirus
   detection will be very useful as a trace route of faecal pollution, more
   importantly, it could be very useful in contributing to the creation of
   a databank of circulating enteric viruses. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Benzotriazole and its derivatives comprise an important class of
   corrosion inhibitors, typically used as trace additives in industrial
   chemical mixtures such as coolants, deicers, surface coatings, cutting
   fluids, and hydraulic fluids. Recent studies have shown that
   benzotriazole derivatives are a major component of aircraft deicing
   fluids (ADFs) responsible for toxicity to bacteria (Microtox(R)). Our
   current research compared the toxicity of benzotriazole (BT), two
   methylbenzotriazole (MeBT) isomers, and butylbenzotriazole (BBT). Acute
   toxicity assays were used to model the response of three common test
   organisms: Microtox(R) bacteria (Vibrio f ischeri), fathead minnow
   (Pimephales promelas) and water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia). The response
   of all the three organisms varied over two orders of magnitude among all
   compounds. Vibrio fischeri was more sensitive than either C. dubia or P.
   promelas to all the test materials, while C. dubia was less sensitive
   than P. promelas. The response of test organisms to unmethylated
   benzotriazole and 4-methytbenzotriazole was similar, whereas
   5-methylbenzotriazole was more toxic than either of these two compounds.
   BET was the most toxic benzotriazole derivative tested, inducing acute
   toxicity at a concentration of less than or equal to 3.3 mg/l to all
   organisms. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Vinyl chloride (VC) contamination had taken place in heavily polluted
   shallow rivers (Taishogawa and lower Hiranogawa Rivers) in Osaka, Japan.
   VC concentrations ranged from below detection limit to 55.6 mug l(-1)
   (mean: 3.35 mug l(-1), standard deviation: 5.96 mug l(-1)). Of 55
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) analyzed, concentrations of
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (c-DCE), tetrachloroethene (PCE) and
   trichloroethene (TCE) were significantly correlated to VC concentrations
   in the rivers, indicating that they share common sources. The four VOCs
   were invariably present at approximate relative ratios of about
   1:2.7:1.5:0.31 (VC: c-DCE: PCE: TCE). The similarity between sampling
   dates in the distribution pattern of the four VOCs concentrations were
   observed, but their concentrations were different between the dates. The
   concentrations of the four VOCs decreased with distance down the river.
   A sample from the upper Taishogawa River in July 1997 had 55.6 mug l(-1)
   of VC, 152 mug l(-1) of c-DCE, 86.2 mug l(-1) of PCE and 18.4 mug l(-1)
   of TCE, respectively. These values are about an order of magnitude
   higher than the other sites over the study period and are likely
   indicative of point source inputs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two different oxidation treatments, ozonation and electroflocculation,
   were experimented on a pilot scale to test their efficiency in removing
   polluting substances from wastewaters of textile industries. Both pilot
   plants used reproduced Very closely a full-scale treatment in order to
   obtain indications about the feasibility of a transfer on industrial
   scale. By means of ozone treatment very high colour removal (95-99\%)
   was achieved and treated waters were reused satisfactorily in dyeing
   even with light colours. This evidence despite the fact that the
   chemical oxygen demand of treated waters was still in a range (75-120
   mg/l, a decrease up to 60\%) that was usually considered to be too high
   for recycling purposes, especially for dyeing light colours. Treating
   plants working at the above-mentioned conditions should guarantee low
   operating costs. A biological pre-treatment and a sand filtration are
   absolutely essential. The transfer on industrial scale of the treatment
   is currently under development under an already financed European
   project. Electrochemical treatment showed to be very efficient in
   removing colour (80-100\%) and chemical oxygen demand (70-90\%).
   Moreover, a sensible decrease of chloride and sulphate ions was
   detected. Removal of flocculated material (post-treatment) must be,
   however, perfected in order to establish a correct costs-to-benefits
   ratio and therefore, propose an implementation of the technique on an
   industrial scale. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   A review}},

Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{1-22}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric water vapour processing (AWVP) technology is reviewed. These
   processors are machines which extract water molecules from the
   atmosphere, ultimately causing a phase change from vapour to liquid.
   Three classes of machines have been proposed. The machines either cool a
   surface below the dewpoint of the ambient air, concentrate water vapour
   through use of solid or liquid desiccants, or induce and control
   convection in a tower structure. Patented devices vary in scale and
   potable water output from small units suitable for one person's daily
   needs to structures as large as multi-story office buildings capable of
   supplying drinking water to an urban neighbourhood.
   Energy and mass cascades (flowcharts) are presented for the three types
   of water vapour processors. The flowcharts assist in classifying designs
   and discussing their strengths and limitations. Practicality and
   appropriateness of the various designs for contributing to water
   supplies are considered along with water cost estimates. Prototypes that
   have been tested successfully are highlighted.
   Absolute humidity (meteorological normals) ranges from 4.0 g of water
   vapour per cubic metre of surface air in the atmosphere (Las Vegas,
   Nevada, USA) to 21.2 g m(-3) (Djibouti, Republic of Djibouti).
   Antofagasta, Chile has a normal absolute humidity of 10.9 g m(-3). A
   40\% efficient machine in the vicinity of Antofagasta requires an
   airflow of IO m(3) s(-1) to produce 3767 1 of water per day. At a
   consumption of 50 1 per person per day, 75 people could have basic water
   requirements for drinking, sanitation, bathing, and cooking met by a
   decentralized and simplified water supply infrastructure with attendant
   economic and societal benefits. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The occurrence of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) blooms and the
   possibility of production of cyanotoxins (algal toxins) have become
   major concerns for drinking water providers worldwide. Ozone has been
   shown to be effective for the destruction of some classes of toxins
   under specific conditions, although most researchers agree that the dose
   and contact time required will depend on water quality. The
   clarification of the relative effects of water quality parameters such
   as dissolved organic carbon concentration and character, and alkalinity,
   has not been previously attempted. In this study the cyanotoxins
   microcystin LR and LA and anatoxin-a were ozonated at a range of ozone
   doses in four treated waters with very different water quality. For both
   the toxins, 100\% destruction was related to a residual ozone
   concentration present after 5 min. This was, in turn, related to the
   water qualify and indicated that a direct reaction with molecular ozone
   could be responsible for the destruction. The results confirmed that
   both the toxins would be destroyed under conditions usually utilised for
   ozonation prior to granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration. This will
   apply under a range of water quality conditions but not necessarily a
   range of temperatures. The saxitoxin class of compounds was Very
   resistant to oxidation by ozone and would require further treatment such
   as GAC filtration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   93\% at pH 7.0, with the adsorbent dose of 5 g/l of particle size
   200-250 mum at 30 degreesC. The removal of these two pesticides was
   achieved up to 97-98\% in column experiments at a flow rate of 0.5
   ml/min. The adsorption was found to be exothermic in nature. The bagasse
   fly ash system has been used for the removal of DDD and DDE from the

Abstract = {{The rate of Cryptosporidium parvum inactivation decreased with
   decreasing temperature (1-20 degreesC) for ozone and for monochloramine
   applied alone as well as after pre-treatment with ozone. Synergy was
   observed at all temperatures studied for the ozone/monochloramine
   sequential disinfection scheme. The synergistic effect was found to
   increase with decreasing temperature. The inactivation rate with
   monochloramine after ozone pre-treatment was 5 times faster at 20
   degreesC and 22 times faster at 1 degreesC than the corresponding
   post-lag phase rates of inactivation with monochloramine at these
   temperatures when no ozone pre-treatment was applied. The CT required
   for achieving 2-logs of inactivation ranged from 11 400 mg min l(-1) at
   20 degreesC to 64 600 mg min l(-1) at 1 degreesC when monochloramine was
   applied alone. In contrast, the CT required for an overall sequential
   inactivation of 2-logs ranged from 72.1 mg min l(-1) at 20 degreesC to
   1350 mg min l(-1) at 1 degreesC when applying monochloramine after ozone
   pre-treatment. The presence of excess ammonia in the monochloramine
   solutions was not responsible for the synergy observed in
   ozone/monochloramine sequential disinfection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Polyelectrolyte conditioning is a common practice in wastewater
   management. This paper experimentally elucidated the thermal pyrolysis
   characteristics of waste activated sludge at a temperature range of
   300-900 K (27-627 degreesC) using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in
   inert atmosphere, with especial attention on the effect of
   polyelectrolyte flocculation (using cationic polyacrylamide). On the
   pyrolysis rate vs temperature plot two maxima were noted. At the heating
   rate of 8 degreesC/min, polyelectrolyte does not influence the pyrolysis
   process. As higher heating rates (14 and 20 degreesC/min), on the other
   hand, flocculation to charge neutralization point would enhance the rate
   of thermal pyrolysis. A simple two parallel-reaction kinetic model is
   applied to interpret the experimental data. Possible roles of flocculant
   on sludge pyrolysis are discussed on the basis of change in sludge
   structures and the hindrance of surface reactions of sludge particles.

Abstract = {{An electrochemical reactor was designed and operated to treat the
   solution containing copper ions. Design parameters for the
   electrochemical reactor using the porous cathode and RuO2/IrO2/Ti anode
   were investigated. The porous cathode was prepared by the electroless
   nickel deposition on polyurethane. The apparent current, the gap between
   cathode and anode, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) were selected as
   design parameters. The copper removal rate increased with an increase in
   apparent current. It was not affected by the gap between the cathode and
   the anode. A reduction in hydraulic retention time stimulated the mass
   transfer toward the electrode and increased the cathodic current
   efficiency. Dimensional analysis was conducted to obtain the design
   equation for scale-up of the electrochemical reactor. The dependence of
   Sh on Re, Sc, and characteristic lengths, D-C/A/L and D-W/C/L, was
   described in the form of a power series. The coefficients were obtained

Abstract = {{The effects that wastewater quality and mode of operation have on the
   performance of an asymmetric, hollow fiber, polysulfone, ultrafiltration
   (UF) membrane with a molecular weight cutoff of 100,000 Daltons were
   investigated. Performance was assessed through monitoring membrane flux,
   transmembrane pressure, effluent biochemical oxygen demand, and
   operational cost of the experimental system while treating filtered
   secondary, secondary, and filtered primary effluents. Fluxes achieved
   for filtered secondary (129-173 l/m(2) h), secondary (101-158 l/m(2) h),
   and filtered primary (20-41 l/m(2) h) effluents were compared to those
   obtained at three other locations where similar UF systems were
   operated. A conceptual model of the impact of an insufficient backwash
   and of operating the UF system at constant flux on membrane performance
   is presented to explain the differences in fluxes. Employing
   pre-membrane granular filtration to remove a portion of the problematic
   particles in secondary effluent prior to UF led to optimal operational
   conditions. The costs associated with the operation of pre-membrane
   granular filtration were offset by the increase in production achieved.
   Although the use of recirculation could increase maintainable flux when
   treating a concentrated feed (e.g., filtered primary effluent), the
   associated costs were high. Improved UF performance was found to result
   from allowing flux to decline naturally, rather than using a constant
   flux mode of operation. The effluents produced when altered secondary
   and secondary effluents were the feeds would be equivalent to an
   oxidized, coagulated, clarified, and filtered wastewater as per Title 22
   California Wastewater Reclamation Criteria. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The heat shock protein, GroEL, was found to be induced in activated
   sludge cultures exposed to perturbations of chemicals (cadmium,
   pentachlorophenol, and acetone) or heat stress. In laboratory activated
   sludge reactors, GroEL was rapidly induced (within minutes) in the
   presence of 5 mg/l or greater total cadmium. At 5 mg/l cadmium, however,
   moderate to insignificant changes in activated sludge process
   performance indicators {[}effluent suspended solids concentration,
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, and specific oxygen uptake rate]
   were observed. As total cadmium concentrations increased above 5 mg/l,
   there was a significant and consistent increase in effluent volatile
   suspended solids concentrations from activated sludge sequencing batch
   reactors relative to unstressed controls. These results indicate that
   stress proteins may serve as sensitive and rapid indicators of mixed
   liquor toxicity which can adversely impact treatment process
   performance, but that GroEL may not be a good candidate protein for this
   purpose. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorine dioxide when used as an effective disinfectant forms
   undesirable disinfection byproducts, i.e. chlorite and chlorate ions.
   The aim of this research was to study the removal of these ions by
   ferrous ions in the presence or absence of oxygen. The efficiency of
   Fe2+ for ClO2- and ClO3- removal was followed by a determination of
   their initial and final concentrations, pH and Delta Fe+2 consumed/Delta
   ClO2- removed ratios. The optimal weight ratio of Delta Fe+2
   consumed/Delta ClO2- removed for complete ClO2 removal was found to be
   close to the theoretical calculated value of 3.31. It was proved that
   ferrous salts can reduce chlorite ions to harmless Cl- ions. This method
   can be recommended as a part of ClO2 disinfection to ensure safe
   drinking water, with no harm to water consumers and to the environment.

Abstract = {{The ozonation of pyruvic acid (2-ketopropionic acid) in aqueous
   solutions, catalyzed by Mn(II) and Mn(IV) ions, has been studied at
   three different pH values (pH=1.1, 2.0 and 3.0). A mathematical model of
   the unsteady operation of the experimental reactor has been developed,
   which takes into account the reactions occurring in the liquid phase and
   the ozone mass transfer from the gas bubbles. Those reactions have been
   described with two alternative kinetic models, both made out of four
   elementary steps. The two kinetic models correlate the experimental data
   with a fair accuracy, respectively at the lowest and at the highest pH
   examined. In particular, at pH=3.0, the ozonation results are inhibited
   by the acetate ions produced by the reaction itself. This effect has
   been correctly described in the terms of a complex formed with the low
   oxidation-state manganese, which successively reacts with the dissolved
   ozone. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to obtain data about the contamination of
   different environmental compartments (102 surface water samples, 59
   sediment samples and 165 eel samples) by polycyclic musks (HHCB, AHTN,
   ADBI, AHMI, and ATII) within the framework of an exposure monitoring
   program.
   Results for HHCB (Galaxolide{''}) gave the following mean values in
   areas strongly polluted with sewage: surface water 1.59 mug l(-1);
   sediment 0.92 mg kg(-1) d.w. and eel 1513 mug kg(-1) f.w. (in the edible
   portion) (6471 mug kg(-1) lipid). The following average concentrations
   were found in waters hardly contaminated with sewage: surface water 0.07
   mug l(-1), sediment <0.02 mg kg(-1) and eel 52 <mu>g kg(-1) f.w. (445
   mug kg(-1) lipid). Mean concentrations of 6.85 mug l(-1) (maximum: 13.3
   mug/l) could be measured at sewage treatment plants' outlets.
   It could be shown that these polycyclics are highly suited to use as
   indicators of the degree of contamination of waters with organic
   substances originating from sewage. A mean bioconcentration factor (BCF)
   on wet weight of 862 (HHCB) and 1069 (AHTN) for the transfer from water
   to eel under natural conditions could be calculated. The corresponding
   BCF-values based on the lipid content of eel were 3504 (HHCB) and 5017
   (AHTN). (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Using oligonucleotide probes directed at the rRNA of filamentous

   transient substrate overloads on the growth of the dominant filamentous
   bacteria of activated sludge fed by a synthetic substrate. By
   dissociating the massive input of organic matter from the oxygen
   shortage that the latter generally induces, it is revealed that each of
   these factors applied alone, induces only transitory, small-scale growth
   of the filaments Nostocoida limicola, Haliscomenobacter hydrossis,
   Thiothrix and of type 021N. In contrast, combining them during a
   reconstituted transient substrate overload with an artificially created
   oxygen deficit, induces very fast growth of H. hydrossis which is
   responsible for establishing major proliferation. This massive
   proliferation was easily reduced by chlorination. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The reduction of Cr(VI) in aqueous solution by UV/TiO2 reduction process

   reduction rates of Cr(VI) by photocatalytic-induced elections were
   significantly higher for acidic solutions than those for alkaline
   solutions. Increasing the light intensity would drastically increase the
   reduction rate of Cr(VI), but was ultimately influenced by the amount of

   effect on the reduction of Cr(VI) by UV/TiO2 process in acidic
   solutions. The presence of ethanol might act as scavenger for holes and
   promoted the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) by electrons. The Cr(VI)
   adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 particles was observed to be
   photoreduced to Cr(III) almost completely. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The organic matter of wastewater was fractionated into settleable (i.e.,
   particulate) and non-settleable (i.e., colloidal+soluble) fractions by
   settling followed by 0.22 mum filtration. Particulate, colloidal and
   soluble proportions were found to be relatively constant (45, 31 and
   24\% of the total COD, respectively). Transfer of soluble fraction
   always occurred from the wastewater to the activated sludge flocs,
   whereas bidirectional transfer occurred for the colloidal fraction. The
   transfer of soluble and colloidal matter reached a steady state after 40
   min-mixing and 20 min-mixing, respectively. Desorption of a part of the
   colloidal organic matter pre-sorbed on the activated sludge flocs was
   evidenced. The biosorption capacity of activated sludge was around
   40-100 mg(COD)gT(SS)(-1). The biosorbable fraction of wastewater
   represented on average 45\% of the non-settleable fraction. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Enhanced biological phosphorus removal wastewater treatment plants that
   use anaerobic digesters for sludge treatment, have high phosphorus
   concentrations in the sidestreams from their sludge dewatering
   equipment. To remove phosphorus from such sidestreams controlled
   struvite crystallisation can be used. Struvite (or MAP) is a naturally
   occurring crystal of magnesium, ammonium and phosphate. We present
   operational results obtained with a continuously operated pilot-scale
   MAP reactor. The pilot-scale reactor (143 1) was an air agitated column
   reactor with a reaction and a settling zone, based on the Phosnix
   process of Unitika Ltd., Japan. The influent to the MAP reactor was
   centrate from the centrifuge that dewaters anaerobically digested sludge
   at the Oxley Creek wastewater treatment plant in Brisbane. We used a
   60\% magnesium hydroxide slurry to add the required magnesium to the
   process and to obtain the alkaline pH value required. The pilot-scale
   MAP process achieved an ortho-P removal ratio of 94\% from an average
   influent ortho-P concentration of 61 mg/l. The reactor was operated at a
   pH of around 8.5, Insufficient dosing of magnesium reduced the P removal
   performance. There was no influence of the hydraulic residence time on
   the process in the range of 1-8 h. The dry MAP product had cadmium, lead
   and mercury concentrations well below the legal limits for fertilisers
   in Queensland, Australia and can be reused as a valuable slow-release
   fertiliser. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study was initiated to explore the potential of a hybrid
   biological reactor, combining trickling filter (TF) and activated sludge
   process (ASP), to treat wastewater containing trichloroethylene (TCE) at
   ambient temperature at different hydraulic retention time (HRT). The
   biofilm acclimation was achieved in 55-60 days with gradual increase in
   TCE concentration from 1 mg/l to 100 mg/l with a parallel increase in
   the concentration of substrate sodium acetate and other nutrients. COD
   and TCE concentration were taken as prime parameters for monitoring the
   growth of biofilm. During acclimation COD removal varied beta een
   54.6-97.5\% while TCE was removed 72.6-99.9\%. HRT study was performed
   after acclimation. The removal efficiency increased with decreasing flow
   rate with maximum TCE removal (99.99\%) at 6 l/d corresponding to an HRT
   of 28 h (TF 18 h+ASP 10 h). This was followed by a C:N:P ratio study. A
   ratio of 100:20:1 led to the sustenance of maximum TCE removal. h
   Maximum TCE removal (99.99\%) was observed at a substrate: cosubstrate
   ratio of 100:1. A pH of 7.4 +/- 0.2 was found to be optimum for
   degradation. Finally, volatilization losses were estimated to be 18.5\%.
   A mass balance gave an efficiency of 81.51\% for biological removal of

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{167-179}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption isotherms of organic micropollutants in coexistence with
   natural organic matter (NOM) were analyzed to evaluate the impacts of
   pore size distribution of activated carbon (AC) on the competition
   effects of the NOM. Single solute adsorption experiments and
   simultaneous adsorption experiments with NOM contained in a
   coagulation-pretreated surface water were performed for four
   agricultural chemicals and three coal-based activated carbons (ACs)
   having different pore distributions. The results showed that, for all
   the carbons used, the adsorption capacity of the chemicals was reduced
   distinctly in the presence of NOM. Such a reduction was more apparent
   for AC with a larger portion of small pores suitable for the adsorption
   of small organic molecules and for the agricultural chemicals with a
   more hydrophilic nature. Ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST)
   incorporated with the Freundlich isotherm expression (IAST-Freundlich
   model) could not interpret the impact of NOM on the adsorption capacity
   of the chemicals unless a pore blockage effect caused by the adsorption
   of NOM was also considered. By taking into account this effect, the
   adsorption isotherm of the chemicals in the presence of NOM was well
   described, and the capacity reduction caused by the NOM was
   quantitatively assessed from the viewpoints of the site competition and
   the pore blockage. Analytical results clearly indicated that pore
   blockage was an important competition mechanism that contributed to
   10-99\% of the total capacity reductions of the chemicals, the level
   depended greatly on the ACs, the chemicals and the equilibrium
   concentrations, and could possibly be alleviated by broadening the pore
   size distributions of the ACs to provide a large volume percentage for
   pores with sizes above 30 Angstrom. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Measurement of nitrifiable nitrogen contained in wastewater by combining
   the existing respirometric and titrimetric principles is reported.
   During an in-sensor-experiment using nitrifying activated sludge. both
   the dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH in the mixed liquor were measured, and
   the FH was controlled at a set-point through titration of base or acid.
   A combination of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR), which was obtained from
   the measured DO signal, and the titration data allowed calculation of
   the nitrifiable nitrogen and the short-term biological oxygen demand
   (BOD) of the wastewater sample that was initially added to the sludge.
   The calculation was based solely on stoichiometric relationships. The
   approach was preliminarily tested with two types of wastewaters using a
   prototype sensor. Good correlation was obtained. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A phosphate removal sludge was bioaugmented with the aerobic
   denitrifier, Microvirgula aerodenitrificans in order to reduce the
   nitrate produced during the aerobic nitrifying-phosphate uptake phase.
   Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to follow the fate of
   the added strain. In order to maintain the pure strain in the complex
   ecosystem, diverse physiological and kinetic based strategies of
   bioaugmentation were tested under the sequencing batch reactor (SBR)
   type culture. The nature of the M. aerodenitrificans inoculum (adapted
   to nitrate-aerobic conditions or to anoxic one) had no influence on the
   SBR performances and did not enhance aerobic denitrifying performances.
   The optimum quantity of the added strain (10\% of the total biomass)
   seemed to have much more positive influence on the long term maintenance
   of the purl strain than on the SBR performances. A small but daily
   supply of M. aerodenitrificans gave exactly the same result than a
   massive and 1-day supply, i.e. no enhancement of performances and no
   amelioration of the length of maintenance. A continuous supply of carbon
   during the first hour of the aerobic phase combined to a 10\% supply of
   M. aerodenitrificans gave the best compromise in terms of phosphate
   removal, nitrification and aerobic denitrification performances. It was
   accompanied too by a decreased number of the ammonia and
   nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and a modification of the nitrite-oxidizing
   flee structure. FISH on M. aerodenitrificans revealed that (i) before
   bioaugmentation, the strain was already present in the phosphate removal
   sludge and (ii) the added bacteria almost disappeared from the reactor
   after 16 HRT. In a last experiment, M. aerodenitrificans embedded in
   alginate beads allowed enhancement of both aerobic denitrifying
   performances and length of strain maintenance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A numerical model was developed to simulate the non-steady-state
   behavior of biologically-active filters used for drinking water
   treatment. The biofilter simulation model called ``BIOFILT{''} simulates
   the substrate (biodegradable organic matter or BOM) and biomass (both
   attached and suspended) profiles in a biofilter as a function of time.
   One of the innovative features of BIOFILT compared to previous biofilm
   models is the ability to simulate the effects of a sudden loss in
   attached biomass or biofilm due to filter backwash on substrate removal
   performance. A sensitivity analysis of the model input parameters
   indicated that the model simulations were most sensitive to the values
   of parameters that controlled substrate degradation and biofilm growth
   and accumulation including the substrate diffusion coefficient, the
   maximum rate of substrate degradation, the microbial yield coefficient.
   and a dimensionless shear loss coefficient. Variation of the hydraulic
   loading rate or other parameters that controlled the deposition of
   biomass via filtration did not significantly impact the simulation
   results. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A biofilter model called ``BIOFILT'' was used to simulate the removal of
   biodegradable organic matter (BOM) in full-scale biofilters subjected to
   a wide range of operating conditions. Parameters that were varied
   included BOM composition, water temperature (3.0-22.5 degreesC), and
   biomass removal during backwashing (0-100\%). Results from biofilter
   simulations suggest a strong dependence of BOM removal on BOM
   composition. BOM with a greater diffusivity or with faster degradation
   kinetics was removed to a greater extent and also contributed to shorter
   biofilter start-up times. In addition, in simulations involving mixtures
   of BOM (i.e. readily degradable and slowly degradable components), the
   presence of readily degradable substrate significantly enhanced the
   removal of slowly degradable material primarily due to the ability to
   maintain greater biomass levels in the biofilters. Declines in
   pseudo-steady state BOM removal were observed as temperature was
   decreased from 22.5 to 3 degreesC and the magnitude of the change was
   significantly affected by BOM composition. However, significant removals
   of BOM are possible at low temperatures (3-6 degreesC). Concerning the
   impact of backwashing on biofilter performance, BOM removal was not
   affected by backwash resulting in biomass removals of 60\% or less. This
   suggests that periodic backwashing should not significantly impact
   biofilter performance as observed biomass removals from full-scale
   biofilters were negligible. In general, the simulation results were in
   good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental results
   obtained from full-scale biofilters. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The speciation of organotin compounds is essential due to the
   species-dependent toxicity, especially in natural waters. Precautions
   have to be taken during sampling and storage of waters in order to
   prevent degradations and lasses. Experimental design methodology has
   been used to study the conditions of stability of organotins after water
   sampling in rivers. The modelling of results allows the determination of
   optimal conditions of preservation. After acidification at pH=4 with
   nitric acid, the storage in polyethylene containers at 4 degreesC in the
   dark is suitable to preserve the most degradable trisubstituted
   (butyl-and phenyl-) species over 1 month. These conditions of sampling
   and storage are applied to two different freshwaters. The rate of
   species decomposition appears to be only dependent on the water nature,
   whatever the organotin concentrations in the sample. Speciation could be
   so preserved between 1 and 3 months. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The fate and distribution of chlorine in aqueous solutions containing
   four pure bacterial cultures was studied. Solutions were subjected to
   chlorination at different initial free chlorine concentrations.
   Resulting concentrations of residual chlorine were determined by both
   DPD/FAS titration and membrane introduction moss spectrometry (MIMS). In
   all cases, false-positive breakpoint chlorination curves, probably
   attributable to the formation of chloroorganic-N compounds, were
   observed by DPD/FAS titration, while little or no inorganic residual
   chloramine was found by MIMS. Free chlorine was observed in similar
   quantities by both methods after chlorine demand by bacterial cellular
   materials in solution was satisfied. These results indicated the
   residual chloramines existed in the form of organic chloramines; these
   compounds are generally recognized as being poor antimicrobial agents.
   Further investigation confirmed that the bacterial cells were the source
   of organic-N compounds. The kinetics of chlorination of pure bacterial
   suspensions was also studied. The pattern of residual chlorine decay
   following chlorination of the bacterial suspensions indicated rapid
   initial free chlorine consumption, followed by slow free chlorine
   consumption, with trace quantities of inorganic chloramine being formed.

Abstract = {{Two similar anaerobic fixed-bed bioreactors which allowed the biomass to
   be periodically withdrawn were run in parallel. After feeding each
   digester with synthetic dairy wastes of different lipid content (Period
   I), both digesters were fed with increasing sodium oleate concentrations
   with skim milk as co-substrate (Period II) and oleate as the sole carbon
   source (Period III). In Period I: the digester fed with lipids was more
   efficient and exhibited lower levels of volatile fatty acids than the
   digester fed without lipids. The biofilm built up in the presence of
   lipids was thinner, but more resistant to the presence of oleate than
   the biofilm formed in the absence of Lipids. which lost 53\% of its
   solids after contacting with oleic acid. The specific methanogenic
   activity with butyrate as substrate was enhanced in the presence of
   lipids, but no significant effect was detected on the acetoclastic and
   hydrogenophilic activities, which remained similar for both digesters
   along the trial period. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Oleic acid toxicity and biodegradability were followed during long-term
   operation of two similar anaerobic fixed-bed units. When treating an
   oleate based effluent, the sludge from the bioreactor that was
   acclimated with Lipids during the first operation period, show ed a
   higher tolerance to oleic acid toxicity (IC50 = 137 mg/l) compared with
   the sludge fed with a non-fat substrate (IC50 = 80 mg/l). This sludge
   showed also the highest biodegradation capacity of oleic acid, achieving
   maximum methane production rates between 33 and 46 mlCH(4(STP))/gVS.day
   and maximum percentages of methanization between 85 and 98\% a for the
   rang of concentrations between 500 and 900 mg oleate/l. When oleate nas
   the sole carbon source fed to both digesters, the biomass became
   encapsulated with organic matter, possibly oleate or an intermediate of
   its degradation, e.g. stearate that was degraded at a maximum rate of 99
   mlCH(4(STP))/gVS.day. This suggests the possibility of using
   adsorption-degradation cycles for the treatment of LCFA based effluents.
   Both tolerance to toxicity and biodegradability of oleic acid were
   improved by acclimatization with lipids or oleate below a threshold
   concentration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Zooplankton assemblages and biomass during a 4-period survey in a
   northern Mediterranean coastal lagoon}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{The authors proposed to examine zooplankton biomass at three stations
   inside (T and Z) and outside (M) a coastal lagoon of the north-western
   Mediterranean Sea. Station T represented the lagoon central area, and
   station Z was positioned in a shellfish farming sector, while the
   seaside station (M) served as a reference of marine environment.
   Analyses were designed to outline the net zooplankton assemblages
   (taxonomic structures and length distributions) in different
   environmental conditions, including the fanning activity. A discriminant
   analysis of environmental variables determined that temperature,
   salinity and phytoplankton implied mainly in spatial pattern of the
   samples. An ordination of taxa biomasses showed two main factors which
   might contribute to the organisation of the zooplankton assemblages: the
   geographical position and the thermal period. The geographical position
   integrated the lagoon-sea water exchange under forcing parameters
   (habitat, tides and winds). The thermal period reflected both the
   populations development cycles and the environmental constraints
   (temperature, salinity, trophic resources). The resulting effects
   appeared in structured zooplankton assemblages in space and time. The
   number of 50 mum interval length classes and of taxa decreased from the
   seaside and the lagoon central area free of farming activity to the
   shallower farming zone. But the biomass-length distribution profiles did
   not closely follow such an expected opposition between opened and
   confined areas: more extended profiles were observed at station Z.
   Biomass dominant size classes concerned the range up to 300 mum. This
   size category appeared to collapse in terms of biomass from the seaside
   or central area of the lagoon towards the farming area, similarly to
   zooplankton global biomass fluctuations. Difference between biomass
   levels and between biomass structures suggested that net zooplankton
   partly acted as food competitors of macro-filtering organisms, and as
   preys for farming shellfish and associated epifauna. This impact mainly
   concerned microzooplankton populations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A fluidized bed reactor for nitrification with chalk as the biomass
   carrier and the sole buffer agent was studied. Chalk dissolution in the
   reactor was found to follow the stoichiometric ratio of 1 mole of CaCO3
   dissolved for each mole of Nh(4)(+) oxidized. Three batches of chalk,
   each one having a different dissolution rate, were used to replace the
   dissolved chalk. The three dissolution rates resulted in three different
   steady state pH levels in the reactor (4.7-6.6) and nitrification rates.
   Nitrification was found to be limited by either the chalk dissolution
   rate or dissolved oxygen concentration depending on the type of chalk
   used. A maximal nitrification rate of 1.44 g NH4+-N/l reactor . d was
   observed. The average cell yield was 0.1 g cells/g N oxidized, similar
   to the cell yield during reactor start-up when the pH was 7. The
   specific ammonium oxidation rates varied between 0.08 and 0,15 mg NH4+-N
   oxidized/mg protein . h. values which are in the reported range For
   nitrification at pH 7 to 8. Oxygen update rate (OUR) results indicated
   that the major mechanism responsible for the high nitrification rate
   observed in the reactor operating at low pH seems to be the favorable
   microenvironment provided by the chalk. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   32, 2962-3967], anaerobic biodegradation of the polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and biphenyl in a fluidized bed
   reactor (FBR) enrichment was demonstrated. In this paper, re-feeding and
   mineralization experiments with sub-cultures of the nitrate-reducing
   enrichment are described. The sub cultures continued to remove the PAHs
   after three feedings. PAH biodegradation ceased when nitrate was
   depleted and resumed when the enrichment was fed nitrate, demonstrating
   that PAH biodegradation was dependent upon nitrate reduction. Tests with
   radiolabeled PAH confirmed that PAH was mineralized, although the extent
   of mineralization differed greatly with different PAHs. Only partial
   mineralization (17\% of initial carbon) was observed when the culture
   was fed naphthalene, whereas nearly complete mineralization (96\%) was
   observed with phenanthrene. PAH carbon was incorporated into cell mass
   and mineralized after complete biodegradation of the PAHs, with 78-102\%
   recoveries of radiolabel for naphthalene and phenanthrene. respectively.
   PAH carbon incorporation into biomass also varied considerably. Minor
   assimilation of biphenyl or phenanthrene was observed in the culture,
   whereas extensive assimilation of naphthalene carbon (57\%) was observed
   when the culture was challenged with naphthalene. PAH degradation was
   approximately stoichiometric with the amount of nitrate consumed.
   Headspace analysis showed production of N2O suggesting the enrichment
   coupled the biodegradation of PAH to denitrification. (C) 2000 Published

Abstract = {{A new adsorbent containing a carboxylate group has been prepared by the
   surface modification of a polyacrylamide grafted hydrous tin (IV) oxide
   gel. The product exhibits a very high adsorption potential for Pb(II),
   Hg(II) and Cd(II). The effect of initial metal ion concentration,
   adsorbent dose pH concentration of light metal ions, and temperature on
   metal removal has been studied. The process follows a first-order rate
   kinetics. The intraparticle diffusion of metal ions through pores in the
   adsorbent was shown to be the main rate limiting step. The equilibrium
   data fit well with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. The selectivity
   order of the adsorbent is Pb(II) > Hg(II) > Cd(II). Adsorption rate
   constants and thermodynamic parameters were also presented to predict
   the nature of adsorption. The method was applied on synthetic
   wastewaters. Acid regeneration has been tried for several cycles with a
   view to recover the adsorbed metal ions and also to restore the sorbent
   to its original state. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of major nutrient additions on trace metal uptake (Cd, Se,
   and Zn) in a coastal diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was investigated. A
   short-term exposure (5 h) was employed to measure the concentration
   factor (ratio of metal concentration in the cells to metal concentration
   in the medium) which was used as a kinetic parameter to quantify the
   relative rate of metal uptake in the cells. Following an initial rapid
   surface sorption, a linear pattern of uptake over time was typical for
   Cd, Se and Zn, indicating that these metals may have been transported
   intracellularly during the shortterm exposure period. N addition
   significantly increased the rates of Cd uptake in the cells. Although
   the concentration factor of Zn increased with N addition, statistical
   analysis indicated that N addition did not significantly affect the rate
   of Zn uptake in the cells. Se uptake in the cells was independent of N
   additions, but was lowered with increasing Si concentration. Si addition
   did not significantly affect Cd and Zn uptake. Similarly, P addition did
   not influence the rates of metal uptake in the cells. There was a
   significant correlation between the rate of uptake of Cd and Zn and the
   cell growth rate. This study demonstrated that water quality brought
   about by a change in nutrient condition could considerably influence the
   uptake of metals by marine phytoplankton. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Surfactant-modified zeolites (SMZ) have drawn recent attention as
   sorbents due to their removal of multiple types of contaminants and low
   material cost. Hoc-ever, like most sorbents, SMZ has a finite sorption
   capacity for different contaminants. The potential applications,
   economics, and efficiency of SR IZ as a sorbent are related to the
   ability to regenerate the material, This paper reports several methods
   to regenerate chromate- and perchloroethylene-saturated SMZ.
   Regeneration of chromate-saturated SMZ was achieved by Bushing with a
   sodium carbonate:sodium hydroxide solution. However, this high-pH
   solution increased the counterion competition for chromate sorption
   sites and decreased the chromate sorption capacity of the regenerated
   SMZ, As an alternative regeneration method, chromate sorbed to SMZ was
   reduced to Cr{[}II] in situ using sodium dithionite solution. Although
   reduction with dithionite restored the chromate sorption maximum, the
   chromate sorption intensity was lowered, possibly due to the competition
   by sulfate (generated from oxidation of dithionite) for chromate
   sorption sites. Carbonate-regenerated SMZ showed no loss of sorption
   affinity for perchloroethylene (PCE) compared to virgin SMZ. Air
   sparging of PCE-saturated SMZ fully regenerated the SMZ. The results
   show that it is possible to regenerate and re-use SMZ following
   saturation with anionic or nonpolar organic contaminants. (C) 2000

   Nitrate and organic N analyses with second-derivative spectroscopy.
   Limnol. Oceanogr. 37, 907-913). The procedure uses the second derivative
   of the absorption spectrum for nitrate (NO,), which has a peak at
   similar to 224 nm that is proportional to the NO; concentration. Samples
   for total N analysis are first oxidized to NO3- by persulfate digestion.
   The objectives of this study were to: (1) test the accuracy and
   precision of the second derivative method through the use of
   NIST-traceable wastewater check samples; (2) determine whether the
   second derivative method for nitrate analysis can be used for wastewater
   samples and whether the method compares favorably with other currently
   used nitrate analysis methods; and (3) use the method to analyze
   wastewater samples containing a range of nitrate and total nitrogen
   concentrations. Our results indicated that the method needed to be
   modified to include a longer digestion time (60 min) and dilution of
   samples prior to digestion (if needed). With the modified method,
   nitrogen recoveries were not significantly different (P greater than or
   equal to 0.05) from samples with known N concentrations. In addition,
   nitrate concentrations in constructed wetland and wastewater samples
   analyzed by both second derivative spectroscopy and ion chromatography
   were not significantly different. Total nitrogen concentrations in
   wastewater samples also compared favorably to the same samples analyzed
   by Kjeldahl digestion. The method is faster, simpler, requires smaller
   sample volumes, and generates less waste than many EPA-approved methods
   of N analysis, and may offer a suitable alternative to current methods
   for analysis of nitrate and total N in wastewater samples. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{High-pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) has proven to be an
   effective method for determining the molecular weights (MW) of humic
   substances (HS) from a variety of aquatic and terrestrial environments.
   HPSEC systems often use a variable wavelength UV-vis detector, which
   detects the analytes based upon their chromophoric composition. HS
   contain a range of moieties with chromophores having unique molar
   absorptivities (for a given wavelength), and the calculated MW may be
   dependent upon the wavelength chosen for the analysis. As a consequence,
   the choice of wavelength becomes an important parameter for the reliable
   determination of MW by HPSEC. The effect of UV-vis detector wavelength
   on the determination of the MW distribution of selected humic and fulvic
   acids by HPSEC is examined in this paper. For the HS examined, both the
   number (M-n) and weight average (M-w) MW increased with increasing
   wavelength. The relative increase in MW was most pronounced for Lake
   Fryxell fulvic acid, with a 63 and 21\% increase in M-n and M-w,
   respectively, between 220 and 380 nm. The increases observed for
   Suwannee River humic and fulvic acids were less pronounced, M-n was more
   sensitive to changes in detector wavelength than M-w, and as a result
   the target HS appeared to be less polydisperse at higher wavelengths.
   Within the range of wavelengths commonly used for the determination of
   MW of HS by HPSEC (i.e., 220-280 nm), the magnitude of the increases in
   MW was not significant compared to variability in MW that results from
   changes to other operational parameters in HPSEC. (C) 2000 Elsevier
