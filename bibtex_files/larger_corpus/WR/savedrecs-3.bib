Abstract = {{Colloidal phenomena have been shown to be important in the association
   of dispersed virus particles with metal oxides which are also dispersed
   as colloid-sized particles. In the work reported here, cowpea mosaic
   virus (CPMV) and hematite (alpha-Fe2O3) were mixed together in order to
   determine the virus-to-hematite particle ratio under (heterocoagulation)
   conditions where self-aggregation (homocoagulation) of either the virus
   or the hematite was absent. Solution pH had a major influence on the
   heterocoagulation product. At pH 6, where hematite bears a net positive
   surface charge and CPMV bears a net negative charge, the product was
   found to be FC4 (F = one 50 nm hematite particle, C = one 28 nm virus
   particle). At pH 3 where both colloid-size particles are positively
   charged, the product was F3C. These products, expressed as CPMV mass per
   unit hematite surface area, compare closely with the adsorptive uptake
   of proteins by this metal oxide. Measurements were also made of the
   heterocoagulation of poliovirus 1 and colloidal hematite in the absence
   of self-aggregation. Comparisons of protein, CPMV, poliovirus and MS-2
   bacteriophage uptake by the two iron oxides, hematite and magnetite,
   show wide differences that probably reflect differences in the way
   biocolloid (protein or virus particles) concentrations are determined,
   the method of protein or virus preparation, as well as intrinsic
   differences between the oxide surfaces and the biocolloids.}},

   (CCl4) was cultured from an aquifer soil isolated sample from the DOE
   Hanford Site in southeastern Washington State. Experiments were
   performed to determine the effects of nitrate concentration on CCl4

   two different experimental conditions, both of which gave similar cell
   growth. Under conditions where both the electron donor (acetate) and
   electron acceptor (nitrate) were present at all times, little CCl4
   transformation was observed. However, transformation was observed if the
   nitrate concentration was reduced to a level where it was periodically
   depleted. These results are discussed in relation to the design of an in
   situ bioremediation system.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the characterization and treatment of
   recirculation-stabilized sanitary landfill leachate. Leachate from
   recently deposited solid wastes was treated by recirculation through
   areas of the landfill with old wastes. The stabilized effluent forms a
   pond at the lowest point of the landfill. This stabilized leachate was
   characterized by an average COD value of 1141 mg/l, an average BOD value
   of 85 mg/l and a BOD:N:P ratio equal to 100:312:0.30. Heavy metals
   concentrations were lower than those of fresh leachate. The BOD/COD
   ratio of this leachate was below 0.1, which excluded the possibility of
   biological treatment. Physico-chemical methods of treatment employed
   were coagulation, powdered activated carbon adsorption and air stripping
   of ammonia. The results showed that even after the combined treatment
   the COD remaining in water hardly dropped below 300 mg/l. Ammonia
   stripping was efficient at pH 11.5, yet the kinetics were slow.}},

Abstract = {{Multicomponent vapor transport experiments were conducted in large (10.5

   effect of vapor phase sorption on the migration of jet fuel aliphatic
   components. A modified diffusion model accounting for sorption at the
   gas-soil and water-soil interface and vapor partitioning into the soil
   moisture was fitted to the experimental data of some aliphatic vapors
   and appeared to adequately describe their behavior. The best fit results
   were used to determine an overall diffusion coefficient, D, which
   combines the effect of diffusion and sorption for each vapor. The two
   processes were isolated using the soil tortuosity, determined by model
   fitting of the experimental data of n-butane (used as a conservative gas
   tracer). Retardation factor, R, and overall linear sorption
   coefficients, K-obs, computed from the respective D values, increased
   with decreasing water solubility of the aliphatic vapor for the same
   soil. Separation between sorption at the gas-soil and water-soil
   interface was possible only for wet soil but not for dry sand with the

Abstract = {{Lemna minor (duckweed) was grown in treated domestic wastewater
   containing added Cu to study the relationship between complexation and
   bioavailability. Growth was not inhibited until total Cu exceeded
   0.079-0.119 mg/l or internal Cu exceeded 81 to 235 mu g/g. Cu2+ was
   detectable in the wastewater when total Cu measured greater than or
   equal to 0.378 mg/l. There was a significant (P < 0.05) relationship
   between Cu bioconcentration and total Cu in wastewater that was
   attributed, in part, to heterotrophy of duckweed. Results indicated
   that, in addition to the bioavailable Cu2+ species, some complexes of Cu
   formed with ligands in wastewater may also be bioavailable. Measurement
   of the Cu Complexing Capacity (CC) of the wastewater by Ion-Selective
   Electrode (ISE) gave values of 0.26 to 0.29 mg/l and indicated the
   presence of ligands with a continuum of binding strengths which
   eliminated two of three commonly used methods for calculating CC. The
   biologically-measured CuCC based on growth was 0.077-0.125 mg/l when
   calculated by two out of three measures of Effective Concentration (EC)
   and was two to three times more sensitive than the ISE method for
   measurement of CC. ECs based on tissue concentration of Cu rather than
   solution concentration were 81-471 mu g/g and have been proposed as an
   alternative for work in complex solutions like wastewater.}},

   plants containing 215 mu g Cu/g (dry wt) or less. Measurement of SOD
   activity in a reaction mixture showed significant (P < 0.05) reduction
   in activity in extracts made from plants containing 408 mu g Cu/g (dry
   wt) but no reduction in activity when plants contained 215 mu g Cu/g

Abstract = {{The populations of indicator bacteria (mesophilic, coliform and fecal
   streptococci) together with relevant limnological parameters
   (temperature, oxygen, BOD and chlorophyll-a) were recorded during a 6
   year study of three eutrophic ponds. Ecosystems were manipulated with
   fish (Cyprinus carpio) in 2-year management cycles: in spring of the
   first year, the pond was stocked with young fish, and in the fall of the
   second year it was drained and mature fish were harvested. Fish
   management had a direct influence on bacterial numbers and on the basic
   parameters of the systems. A statistical analysis using t-tests found
   significant differences in oxygen concentration, chlorophyll-a and BOD
   during both years of fish management. A water temperature model was
   calculated on an extensive homogenous data set (197 measurements), by
   fitting a regression curve. During each season, populations of indicator
   bacteria increased with increasing water temperature, and maximal
   numbers of bacteria were recorded during the summer months. Correlation
   analysis (fitted Spearman correlation coefficient) confirmed that
   temperature had a positive significant effect on population dynamics.
   The results demonstrate that fish stocking can affect bacterial
   population, in the sense that during high fish biomass (second years)
   the numbers of indicator bacteria as well as BOD and phytoplankton were
   higher. If pond water quality must be optimised for the purposes of
   drinking or recreation, the planned fish yield may have to be reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Fluxes of copper from the sediments to the water column in response to
   the presence of dissolved organic matter were measured in field
   enclosures placed on the floor of the Contrary Creek arm of Lake Anna,
   Virginia. Experimental chambers received a spike input of either sodium
   humate or phytoplankton; unamended chambers served as controls. Over the
   subsequent five days, water samples were withdrawn from the chambers and
   analyzed for total and dissolved copper, total and dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) Eh, pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved sulfides and
   heterotrophic microbial activity. Chambers amended with phytoplankton
   did not experience a rise in dissolved copper concentrations.
   Furthermore, the concentrations of dissolved copper in these chambers
   were not well-correlated with DOC concentrations (r = 0.1175, P =
   0.642). Dissolved copper concentrations in chambers amended with sodium
   humate rose approximately 500\% and remained elevated for the duration
   of the experimental trial (5 days). In this treatment, dissolved copper
   concentrations were well-correlated with DOC concentrations (r = 0.798,
   P < 0.005). The increase in dissolved copper in the chambers amended
   with sodium humate was observed to persist despite reducing conditions
   which were confirmed by redox measurements and the occurrence of
   dissolved sulfides. The addition of sodium humate to the chamber water
   resulted in a net mobilization of copper to the water column from the
   sediments. In contrast, dissolved organic carbon generated by the
   decomposition of phytoplankton did not appear to mobilize copper over
   the time interval examined. None of the changes in soluble copper
   concentrations could be related to Eh or pH effects. Supplementary
   laboratory experiments corroborated the field trials. The results
   suggest that long term (but not short term) products of decomposition
   processes may enhance the concentration of dissolved copper in the water
   column by the formation of soluble organometallic complexes.}},

Abstract = {{The reactions of four sulphur containing s-triazines (prometryne,
   terbutryne, ametryne and desmetryne) with hypochlorous acid (HClO) and
   chlorine dioxide (ClO2) have been investigated using an 11 ppm/3 ppm
   oxidant/herbicide ratio. The main objective of the study was the
   identification of by-products. Additionally, to study the effect of
   oxidant concentration on the reaction rate, two more oxidant/herbicide
   ratios (3 ppm/3 ppb and 11 ppb/3 ppb) have been investigated only for
   prometryne. Oxidation reactions were monitored by high performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC), while, the identification of by-products
   was initially carried out by low resolution HPLC-mass spectrometry
   (HPLC-MS) and confirmed by accurate mass measurement. Under the
   experimental conditions (T = 20 degrees C, pH = 8, reaction time = 48
   h), the results indicate that all the investigated triazines react in
   the same way with each oxidant. The reactions with HClO occur much
   faster than those with ClO2 and give rise to three identified oxidation
   by-products: the sulfoxide, the sulfone and the sulfone's hydrolysis
   product. The reactions with ClO2, instead, give rise to a sole oxidation
   by-product: the sulfoxide. With both oxidants, as expected, the lower
   the oxidant concentration the slower the oxidation rate.
   Based on the obtained results, a general pathway for the oxidation of
   sulphur containing s-triazines is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{The destruction of organic pollutants in water can be achieved by the
   combination of oxidants or of oxidants with u.v. radiation (O-3/H2O2;
   H2O2/u.v.; O-3/u.v.). The efficiency of these advanced oxidation
   processes is accounted for by the generation of very reactive free
   radicals such as hydroxyl radicals. In this paper, experimental data are
   presented to examine the effect of physico-chemical parameters on the
   efficiency of the H2O2/u.v. process for the degradation of chloroethanes
   in dilute aqueous solution and to test a kinetic model for this
   oxidation process. The model is based on known reactions of OH radicals
   in water and on kinetic results obtained in a previous work for the
   photodecomposition of hydrogen peroxide (Nicole et al., 1990).}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogenous organic compounds in raw and treated water are of concern
   because they may exert high chlorine demand. They are also known as
   precursors of halogenated compounds. In this study, chlorine demand, TOX
   and THM formation potentials of 22 free amino acids, and some
   polypeptides and proteins were determined. Results have shown that the
   reactivity of free amino acids with chlorine is related to their
   structure. Experiments conducted with combined amino acids have shown
   that the amide linkage does not participate significantly in the
   chlorine demand of polypeptides, and does not seem to be TOX precursor.
   Specific amino acids that possess reactive side groups such as amino
   nitrogen, sulfur or activated aromatic ring were defined as the main
   chlorine consumer and TOX precursor sites of polypeptides. Complementary
   experiments indicated that sodium sulfite dechlorination can affect,
   more or less, the determination of amino acids TOXFP.}},

   PRODUCTS ON THE GROWTH OF THE MARINE ALGA PAVLOVA-LUTHERI IN
   CONTINUOUS-CULTURE}},

Abstract = {{Organotin compounds have been used as biocides, wood preservatives,
   plastic stabilizers and antifouling agents for many years (Maguire,
   1991). The acute toxicity as well as the sublethal effects of
   tributyltin (TBT) derivatives have been tested for numerous freshwater
   and marine species (Alzieu, 1989; Kelly et al., 1990). The
   biodegradation of TBT in dibutyltin (DBT) and monobutyltin (MBT) is well
   established for some phytoplankton species (Lee et al., 1989) but little
   is known about the physiological adaptation of microalgae to a long term
   sublethal contamination by TBT.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of marine alga
   Pavlova lutheri, cultured in `'chemostat mode'' under axenic conditions,
   to accomodate increasing cocentrations of TBTCI in the culture medium
   and to determine its capacity to degrade TBT in DBT and MBT. Chemostat
   culture of P. lutheri were exposed to contaminated nutrient supplies
   containing 18.5, 74, and 185 nmol l(-1) of TBT chloride (expressed as
   TBT+) respectively. For comparison purposes, a batch culture of P.
   lutheri was exposed to a concentration of 13 nmol l(-1) of TBTCl for a
   48 h-period. Organotin species (BuSn) were monitored by GC/ITD in three
   different fractions: dissolved in the culture medium, adsorbed on the
   external cellular walls, and dissolved in the cellular fluid.
   Within a 24h-period, TBT was observed in the cellular fluid indicating a
   rapid uptake of the contaminant. The ability of P. lutheri to degrade
   TBT was confirmed and found more effective in a continuous culture than
   in a batch culture under similar contamination conditions. MBT was
   observed in both cellular fractions of all cultures (Tables 2 and 3) but
   P. lutheri seems particularly efficient to form MBT at low TBT
   concentration. The amount of BuSn adsorbed onto the cell walls was
   directly related to TBT concentration in the nutrient supply but
   intracellular BuSn decreased from 150 nmol g(-1) (dry weight) to less
   than 60 nmol g(-1) (dry weight) when the TBT concentration increased
   from 74 to 185 nmol l(-1) (Fig. 2).
   The cell density and the growth rate of a continuous culture of P.
   lutheri (Figs 3 and 4) were not affected by a contamination level of
   18.5 nmol l(-1) of TBT. In a continuous culture receiving 74 nmol l(-1)
   of TBT P. lutheri suffered a toxic impact in the first few days of the
   experiment, loosing 40\% of its cell density. However, the culture
   recovered its initial growth rate in the next 10 days in spite of an
   uninterrupted contamination. Finally, a severe toxic shock was observed
   for a culture receiving 185 nmol l(-1) of TBT leading to a major
   dysfunction of the culture in only three days. The toxic effects
   observed in culture productivity (Fig. 5) for treatments at 74 and 185
   nmol l(-1) are also illustrated by a significant decrease of chlorophyll
   a concentration in culture {[}Fig. 6(A)] but not in the individual cells
   {[}Fig. 6(B)] which was an indication of the preservation of life
   functions of cells in all experiments.
   These results evidence the ability of P. lutheri, cultured in chemostat
   mode, to resist and accommodate to a continuous input of a high level of
   TBT to the culture medium degrading TBT into much less toxic species MBT
   and DBT. As a chemostat culture is comparable in many aspects to an open
   natural environment (Rhee, 1980; Wangersky and Maass, 1991). The
   behavior of P. lutheri observed in this study might be extended to the
   natural coastal environment where this alga is present. If such an
   assumption is correct at least regarding the general processes of
   bioaccumulation and degradation, this study clearly indicates that P.
   lutheri might play an important role in the food uptake of BuSn by
   filter feeders and other herbivorous species due to its ability to
   bioaccumulate large quantities of BuSn {[}Fig 2(A) and 2(B)] without
   being irreversibly affected. Fortunately, the natural environment as
   simulated by our continuous cultures seems to strongly accelerate the
   degradation rate of TBT into DBT and MBT, two much less toxic tin
   species. Results of previous studies on the toxicity effects of TBT on
   micro-algae, all conducted in batch cultures, should be interpreted with
   some caution since the ability of P. lutheri and possibly other marine
   algae to survive and grow in TBT contaminated media seems to have been
   grossly underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of hydrogen peroxide, sodium/calcium hypochlorite and
   ferrous/ferric salts on hydrogen sulfide dissolved in waste water were
   investigated to establish an effective odour control system for Kuwait
   Sewage Networks, The waste water samples were collected from the inlet
   structure of main pumping station with pressure pipelines and analyzed
   for dissolved sulfide and pH before and after addition of chemicals
   individually and in combination under controlled laboratory conditions.
   The waste water contained dissolved sulfide in the range of 18 to 25
   mg/l and pH ranged between 7.2 and 7.8. Various concentrations of above
   mentioned chemicals were tried to determine the accurate chemical
   requirement for oxidation or precipitation of dissolved sulfide in waste
   water. The reaction temperature was maintained at 35 degrees C (+/-2
   degrees C), the normal temperature of waste water in Kuwait during
   summer. To oxidize 1 g of sulfide 1.25, 2.0 and 1.8 g hydrogen peroxide,
   sodium hypochIorite and calcium hypochlorite were required respectively.
   To remove 1 g of sulfide by precipitation with ferrous sulfate and
   ferric salt solution, 8 g and 4 g ferrous and ferric salt were required
   respectively under laboratory investigations. A combination of sodium
   hydroxide and sodium hypochlorite was also studied to control malodorous
   hydrogen sulfide in waste water. The addition of sodium hydroxide with
   sodium hypochlorite in waste water reduced the demand of hypochlorite
   50\%. This procedure was found to be cost effective and best suited for
   the warm climate of Kuwait and was implemented in the field at a screw
   conveyor type lifting station with gravity sewer pipelines. When sodium
   hypochlorite was injected without shock loadings of sodium hydroxide
   46\% reduction of dissolved sulfides was recorded and it was increased
   to 57\% with shock loadings of sodium hydroxide, though the quantity of
   sodium hypochlorite was reduced to half than the former case. Similarly,
   45 and 70\% reduction in the emission of gaseous hydrogen sulfide was
   recorded with NaOCl injection without and with NaOH shock loading
   respectively. The cost comparison of all the chemicals when applied in
   field is also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Bioconcentration, depuration and biotransformation of the polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon, pyrene, were studied at pH 4, 6 and 8 with larval
   stages of the chironomid midge, Chironomus riparius. C-14-labelled
   pyrene was applied. The results revealed pH-dependant bioconcentration
   and depuration-kinetics as well as biotransformation of pyrene. At
   higher pH the bioconcentration rate (k(1)) was greater than at lower pH.
   Hereby the bioconcentration rate correlated with the accumulation
   potential of pyrene. That means at pH 8 the larvae accumulated pyrene
   strongest, at pH 4 the bioconcentration of the larvae was lowest. Due to
   biotransformation of pyrene the calculated bioconcentration factor (BCF)
   based on total C-14 found in the larvae. Depuration revealed a biphasic
   kinetic. Data were fit with a two compartment model to calculate the
   volume of each of the two compartments. To calculate for the depuration
   rate (k(2)), data were additionally fit with a one compartment model.
   The larvae displayed an intriguing pH-dependent behaviour: At pH 4 the
   Chironomus larvae started to increase mucus-production of the salivary
   glands and accelerated the built up of their tubes. The latter were of
   `'cocoon''-like structure. At pH 8 the composition of the tubes was more
   loose. It is hypothezised that this response to an acidified environment
   caused the reduced bioconcentration rate as well as the reduced
   biconcentration.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrosomonas europaea from continuous pure cultures was incubated with
   26.4 mu M NH3 (= 0.37 mg NH3-N l(-1)) at various NH4+ concentrations, pH
   values and temperatures. Measured rates of nitrite formation were
   significantly influenced by pH. Likewise unexpectedly, the maximum
   ammonia oxidation rate occurred between pH 6.7 and 7.0. Temperature had
   an even stronger effect on the rate of ammonia oxidation than the
   availability of NH3. It is concluded that the assumption of a strict
   dependence of the rate of ammonia oxidation on substrate concentration
   is an unjustified oversimplification. Among the mechanisms which could
   explain ammonium uptake and oxidation near or below pH 7.0, the
   formation of NO from HNO2 is considered.}},

Abstract = {{The coagulation process is traditionally described in terms of the
   destabilization of colloids present in a water supply. Many studies show
   that coagulants are not only used to destabilize organic or inorganic
   colloidal particles, but also to remove natural organic matter. The
   removal of this organic matter from the bulk water can occur by direct
   precipitation or by adsorption of the organic matter onto metal
   hydroxides. The goal of this study is to compare the removal of organic
   compounds by coagulation and by adsorption onto preformed flocs with
   aluminium and iron salts who are the most used coagulants in drinking
   water treatment.
   Various studies (Chadick and Amy, 1987; Dentel and Gosset, 1988; Edwards
   and Amirtharajah, 1985; Hundt and O'Melia, 1988; Jekel, 1986; Randtke,
   1988; Tipping et al., 1988) have been reported concerning the removal of
   humic substances and the removal of low molecular weight compounds
   (Lefebvre, 1990; Lefebvre et al., 1990).
   Only a few studies show the interactions between preformed hydroxide
   flocs surface and these organic compounds.}},

   measured, weekly. Approximatively 100 bacteria were identified and
   classified in different metabolic groups. A decreasing gradient of
   biomass from top to bottom of the reactor was observed. Backwashing
   operation permitted the removal of 48\% of the fixed biomass. In terms
   of bacterial strains and their potential hydrolytical abilities
   (glucidolytical, proteolytical, and lipolytical), no zonation was
   observed. Most of the species isolated from the granular support belong
   to the following genera and family: Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae,
   Aeromonas, Flavobacterium, and Pseudomonas.}},

Abstract = {{Densities of mesophilic aeromonads were compared in Virginia freshwater
   lakes with trophic classifications ranging from mesotrophic to
   hypereutrophic. Aeromonad concentrations were independent of trophic
   status and did not correlate statistically with water quality parameters
   used to measure trophic state (total phosphorus, chlorophyll a and
   Secchi depth). Bacterial indicators (fecal coliforms and Escherichia
   coli) used to assess the public health safety of recreational waters
   correlated with mesophilic aeromonads only when sewage pollution
   occurred. Overall (n = 101-107) there were small negative correlations
   of aeromonad densities with dissolved oxygen (r = -0.30, P = <0.05), and
   total dissolved nitrogen (r = -0.30, P = 0.05). During frequent sampling
   from April through October 1991, mean mesophilic aeromonad
   concentrations ranged from 10(3-4) cells 100 ml(-1) with the lowest
   values measured during mid-summer. Over the course of twelve months, 273
   aeromonad isolates were identified as belonging to the following
   biotypes: A, sobria (54\%), A. hydrophila (29\%), A. caviae (10\%), and
   undetermined (7\%). Seasonally, the frequency of isolation of A. sobria,
   considered the most pathogenic biotype, increased from 17 to 69\% when
   water temperatures exceeded 20 degrees C in a hypereutrophic lake. These
   temperatures typically occur during periods of peak recreational usage.
   Phenotypic characteristics associated with virulence were positive in
   70\% (hemolysis) and 42\% (autoagglutination) of glycerol-stored strains
   (n = 85), and in 15\% (autoagglutination) of strains immediately
   processed (n = 73). S-layer proteins associated with invasiveness were
   not found in 14 strains which autoagglutinated. To evaluate the public
   health significance of aeromonads in nutrient enriched lakes, our
   results demonstrate a need to couple investigations of mesophilic
   aeromonad ecology with virulence and biotype assessments.}},

Abstract = {{Field tests using `'identical'' cascade crossflow and countercurrent air
   strippers to treat contaminated ground water from an industrial site
   confirmed the advantages of the cascade crossflow configuration which
   had been previously demonstrated in the laboratory. In parametric tests,
   1,2-dichloroethane stripping efficiency and column pressure drop were
   measured as a function of air-to-water ratio using both equal water
   loading rates and equal water flow rates. Pressure drop in the cascade
   crossflow unit was more than one order of magnitude lower, and maximum
   air rates were four to five times greater than the comparable values in
   countercurrent Row. Because of the larger air rates, higher stripping
   efficiency was possible in the cascade crossflow stripper. For example,
   at a water loading rate of 18.9 kg/m(2).s, the maximum 1,2-dichlorethane
   stripping efficiency in countercurrent how was limited to 0.92, while
   greater than 0.99 efficiency was possible using a seven-pass crossflow
   column. Long-term tests, in which both columns were operated
   continuously for as long as two months, showed that the cascade
   crossflow stripper was more resistant to fouling than the countercurrent
   stripper.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distributions of biofilm properties have been investigated.
   Heterotrophic biofilms were cultured by using rotating drum biofilm
   reactors which were fed to a synthetic wastewater. The biofilm was first
   cut into 10-20 mu m thick slices by use of a microtome, and then
   apportioned into samples representing 3 or 4 layers. By measuring total
   suspended solids, phospholipid concentrations and AR18 dye adsorption,
   and using these data with the theoretical model developed in this study,
   the densities, porosities, specific surface area, and mean pore radius
   of biofilms were determined. It was found that the densities (with units
   of mg-TS/cm(3) total biofilm) in the bottom layers were 5-10 times
   higher than those in the top layers; the ratio of living cells to total
   biomass decreased from 72 to 91\% in the top layers to 31-39\% in the
   bottom layers; the porosities of biofilms changed from 84 to 93\% in the
   top layers to 58-67\% in the bottom layers. In contrast, the mean pore
   radius of biofilms decreased from approximately 1.7-2.7 mu m in the top
   layers to 0.3-0.4 mu m in the bottom layers. The results of this study
   are helpful in obtaining a much clearer physical description of
   biofilms.}},

Abstract = {{A cylindrical model (CM) and a random porous cluster model (RPCM) have
   been developed in this paper to evaluate tortuosities, tortuosity
   factors, and effective diffusivities within biofilms, based on
   measurable biofilm properties. The tortuosity factor and the ratio of
   effective diffusivities to diffusivities in bulk solution (D-e/D-b) of
   the biofilm can be evaluated from biofilm porosity data by employing the
   CM presented in this paper. Both tortuosities and effective
   diffusivities depend on the densities and porosities of biofilms. For
   biofilms with porosities of 0.84-0.93 in the top layers and 0.58-0.67 in
   the bottom layer, it was found that tortuosity factors increase from
   1.15 to approximately 1.6, while ratios of D-e/D-b decrease from 68-81\%
   in the top layer to 38-45\% in the bottom layer, based on the CM. The
   spatial distributions of biofilm properties affect the effectiveness
   factor profiles directly. Using incorrect ratios of D-e/D-b would result
   in false modeling results.}},

Abstract = {{Fourteen bacterial strains were isolated from industrial waste (SL)
   agricultural soil (S), surface water (B) or water treatment filter
   material (WT) following enrichment in a minimal salts medium (MSM)
   containing 5-10 mgl(-1) of both atrazine and simazine. Biodegradation by
   the isolates of 1 mu gl(-1) of atrazine and 1 mu gl(-1) simazine in 100
   ml MSM or reservoir surface water was assessed by comparison with
   non-inoculated controls. Extraction with dichloromethane recovered 100
   +/- 5\% of both s-triazines in non-inoculated MSM and reservoir surface
   water. Recovery was not reduced by adsorption of the s-triazines to
   bacteria, and no abiotic degradation occurred over the incubation
   periods. Isolate 54 degraded 20 +/- 7\% of the atrazine and isolates S7
   and S8 degraded 40 +/- 12\% of the simazine in MSM after 7d at 30
   degrees C. Decreasing the NH4NO3-N in the MSM from 35 mgl(-1) to 1
   mgl(-1) stimulated biodegradation of atrazine by a fourth isolate (SL3).
   At 10 degrees C isolates BI, SL2, S4 and S6 each biodegraded 20 +/- 1\%
   of the atrazine and isolate SL2 biodegraded 30 +/- 7\% of the simazine
   in surface water after 15 d. No biodegradation occurred in MSM at 10
   degrees C. Granular activated carbon (GAC, 1 gl(-1))was added to surface
   water (10 mu gl(-1) atrazine and 10 mu gl(-1) simazine) which adsorbed
   9.7 mu gg(-1) s-triazine and provided sites for bacterial attachment.
   Recovery of adsorbed s-triazines (1, 10 and 40 mu gl(-1)) by Soxhlet
   extraction of non-inoculated GAC was 97 +/- 1.5\%. Inoculation of
   s-triazine-degraders into surface water containing GAC reduced the
   solution concentration (0.3 mu gl(-1) atrazine and 0.3 mu gl(-1)
   simazine) by up to 86 +/- 18\% (S8) after incubation for 15 d at 10
   degrees C. Biodegradation of 25 mu gl(-1) atrazine and 28 mu gl(-1)
   simazine in surface water amended with 0.5 gl(-1) GAC and inoculated
   with isolate WT1 was 50 +/- 4\% (atrazine) and 38 +/- 4\% (simazine)
   after 21 d at 10 degrees C. Biodegradation by WT1 attached to 0.5 g GAC
   in surface water (0.5 mu gl(-1) atrazine and 6 mu gl(-1) simazine) was
   increased from zero atrazine and 23 +/- 7.6\% simazine to 40 +/- 5.3\%
   atrazine and 71 +/- 5.6\% simazine following transfer of bioaugmented
   GAC into fresh surface water. Inoculation of GAC filters with selected
   strains has potential as a biotreatment for surface water containing
   s-triazine herbicides.}},

Abstract = {{Hypolimnetic aeration of Medical Lake, WA using partial lift and full
   lift aerator designs resulted in enhanced water quality. The partial
   lift system significantly reduced hypolimnetic ammonia (NH3) and total
   phosphorus (TP) concentrations and increased hypolimnetic temperature.
   The system had no statistically significant effect on chlorophyll a (Chl
   a) concentration, phytoplankton biovolume, hypolimnetic nitrate (NO3-)
   and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. The full lift system also
   significantly reduced hypolimnetic TP and NH3 concentrations, but
   increased hypolimnetic DO and temperature. This system likewise had no
   effect on Chl a concentrations. Although anoxia persisted with the
   partial lift system, it was viewed as effective because phosphorus was
   not released from the lake's bottom, demonstrating that measurable
   concentrations of DO were not required to hold phosphorus in the
   sediments. Further research is required on (1) the effect of
   hypolimnetic aeration on stimulating DO depletion rates and (2) long
   term effects on phytoplankton biovolumes and Chl a concentrations.
   Continued operation of the full lift system should further reduce in
   situ oxygen demands and eventually a new equilibrium and higher
   hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations can be attained.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbon, ozonation and aerated biofilters were applied to
   eliminate odor-causing compounds that occur in wastewater and effluents
   from the activated sludge process. Odorous organics used in this
   experiment were sulfur containing odorous compounds which include carbon
   disulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide,
   and nitrogen containing compounds such as ammonia, trimethylamine,
   dimethylamine and n-propylamine. The removal of sulfur containing
   odorous compounds by activated carbon, was very effective compared to
   nitrogen containing compounds under the same experimental conditions.
   Sulfur containing substances were oxidized with ozone rapidly, while the
   reaction of low aliphatic amines with ozone occurred slowly. Methane
   sulfonic acid was converted from methyl mercaptan through dimethyl
   disulfide by ozonation. Ammonia and trimethylamine was converted to
   nitrate and nitromethane by ozonation, respectively. More than 80\% of
   the sulfur and nitrogen containing malodorants were removed by
   acclimated microorganisms in an aerated biofilter at about 30 min of
   hydraulic retention time. Neither carbon disulfide nor dimethyl
   disulfide were removed at all in the biofilter without aeration.
   Conclusively, the aerated biofilter was the most acceptable process for
   eliminating sulfur and nitrogen containing odorous compounds in
   wastewater as it produced none of the oxidized organics noticed with
   ozonation, and it had an equally high removal efficiency for both sulfur
   and nitrogen containing odorous compounds.}},

Abstract = {{A bench-scale biogenic sulfide and limestone treatment system was used
   to treat acidic metal-contaminated water from the Berkeley Pit, an
   abandoned open-pit copper mine in Butte, Montana. Hydrogen sulfide was
   generated in a sulfate reduction bioreactor and was used to precipitate
   metal sulfides from the mine water in a separate reactor. The
   metal-depleted, sulfate-rich mine water then passed through a
   limestone-filled reactor to raise its pH before entering the bioreactor.
   The treatment process removed more than 99\% of the initial
   concentrations of Fe, Cu, Zn, and Al (620, 178, 530, and 278 mg l(-1),
   respectively) in the mine water. The process also removed 91\% of the
   initial Mn concentration (191 mg l(-1)). Copper and Zn concentrates were
   selectively recovered from the mine water based on the pH-dependent
   dissociation of the added H2S. The limestone used to raise the pH was
   eventually passivated, possibly by the precipitation of gypsum, silica,
   clay minerals, and aluminum hydroxide. A modification of this biogenic
   sulfide/limestone treatment system has the potential to treat Berkeley
   Pit water to within discharge standards, and could generate saleable
   metal sulfide concentrates to partially offset treatment costs.}},

Abstract = {{In a survey of activated sludge plants in Australia, where both foams
   and mixed liquor samples were examined, the organism most frequently
   dominant in both was Microthrix parvicella. Although Nocardia
   amarae-like organisms and Nocardia pinensis were often seen as dominant
   organisms in foams, they only rarely occurred as dominants in mixed
   liquor samples from the same plants. Instead, Types 0041/0675, 0092 and
   Haliscomenobacler hydrossis were more usually present. There appeared to
   be little relationship between filament community composition and plant
   operating parameters, and most filament types were seen in plants with
   diverse characteristics. Partial success was achieved in isolating a few
   of these filaments in pure culture, although in some cases, the media
   successfully used in other studies did not support their growth here.
   Their morphological properties are described.}},

   non-foaming Australian activated sludge plants covering a wide

   morphology were observed under the microscope, particularly with respect
   to their branching angles, branch lengths and interbranch distances,
   pure cultures obtained by micromanipulation from 27 of these plants were
   remarkably consistent in their morphological and physiological
   properties, corresponded to previously described isolates of Nocardia
   pinensis, and were easily differentiated from 25 control cultures of
   related organisms using the API ZYM system. N. pinensis is readily
   differentiated from other `'nocardias'' when activated sludge samples
   are examined microscopically and should be reported separately.}},

Abstract = {{The potential impact of motorboat activity on a major drinking water
   reservoir was evaluated. Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured
   in water and sediment samples at both marina and nonmarina sites during
   peak boating activity in June 1990 and during low boating activity in
   October 1990. Total PAH concentration contour plots and statistical
   analyses were used to determine the impacts of boating activity. Total
   PAH concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mu g/l were present in the
   water during peak boating activity, but aqueous PAHs were not detected
   during low boating activity. PAHs were detected in the sediments during
   both sampling periods; sediment concentrations for total PAHs were
   generally < 700 mu g/kg. The PAH profile of the June water samples was
   representative of combustion and petrogenic sources, while the PAH
   profiles found in the sediments were typical of combustion. Boating was
   shown to be a PAH source to the water column during periods of high
   boating activity. There was a significant difference for total PAH
   concentrations between the marina and nonmarina sites for the sediment
   samples in June, and for the individual PAH concentrations of
   phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene for October; this demonstrated
   localized impacts of boating at marina sites. PAH profiles, ratios, and
   contour plots indicated urban runoff and atmospheric deposition as other
   contributors to PAH concentrations in the water and sediments. The PAH
   concentrations in inlets to the reservoir tended to be higher than those
   detected in the main channel. This indicated an impact of hydrology on
   PAH distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Heavy metals present in sewage sludge can be leached out using
   sludge-indigenous sulfur oxidizing bacteria (Thiobacillus spp.). The
   process depends on the growth of and acid production by these bacteria.
   Biological processes are normally sensitive to temperature and therefore
   temperature fluctuations can affect the process. Experiments were
   conducted to examine these effects in the temperature range of 7-42
   degrees C. It was found that lower temperature resulted in slower
   accumulation of acid and thereby slower pH reduction. Investigations
   into the effect of temperature on process kinetics showed that the
   specific growth rates of the acidophilic as well as less acidophilic
   bacteria varied with the sludge pH at a particular temperature, with the
   degree of variation dependent on the temperature. Although lower pH
   occurred at higher temperatures (as microbial activity and sulfate
   concentration increased), it was found that at constant pH, metal
   solubilization was the same regardless of the temperature.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative study was made in order to estimate the feasibility of
   using waste catalysts for low level sulfide removal from seawater
   polluted with sulfide under aerated and deaerated conditions. Six
   different waste catalysts were used from a typical petrochemical plant.
   A batch recycle reactor with a large recycle ratio was utilized for this
   purpose. It is found that low temperature shift catalyst has a superior
   scavenging efficiency for sulfide removal with an estimated sulfide half
   life of about ten minutes. Generally all the catalysts performed better
   than the homogeneous reaction. The presence of oxygen, can influence the
   effectiveness of these catalysts in removing sulfide. The sulfide
   reaction kinetic was zero order with respect to sulfide concentration
   and the batch recycle reactor containing the waste catalysts with large
   recycle ratio was shown to approximate ideal stirred tank reactor.}},

Abstract = {{The changes in the microbial population of a two-stage anaerobic
   digestion system in terms of number and composition were studied during
   the start-up phase. The numbers of methanogens and non-methanogens
   slightly decreased in the upflow filter, whereas in the
   pre-acidification stage the number of acidogens was reasonably constant.
   Variations in the morphology of the methanogens occurred along the
   filter, for example the numbers of Methanosarcina and filamentous
   bacteria species decreased considerably in the drain, possibly becoming
   attached to the biofilm along the reactor, whereas in the
   pre-acidification stage only a few Methanosarcina species were
   identified. Slight variations within the bacterial populations occurred
   in terms of composition and numbers in the filter. The number of viable
   methanogens varied in the filter effluent depending on the OLR changes
   but this did not adversely affect the COD removal efficiency of the
   upflow filter. Among the autofluorescent methanogenic population,
   Methanococcus, Methanobacterium, Methanobrevibacteria, and
   Methanosarcina species were tentatively identified in the filter.}},

Abstract = {{Freezing and thawing sludge has become an economically feasible
   technique of sludge conditioning in regions where natural freezing is
   available. Even though the dramatic effects of freeze/thaw on dewatering
   have been studied extensively, its effects on the survival of pathogenic
   microorganisms have not been investigated. If freeze/thaw conditioning
   can be shown to reduce pathogenic microorganisms, then sludges treated
   in this fashion can be disposed of on land with less risk of health
   effects. In this paper, the effects of freezing rate, temperature and
   time in the frozen state on the removal of pathogens are tested. The
   response of seven indicators of microbial contamination; fecal
   coliforms, Salmonella, plaque forming units, fecal streptococci,
   poliovirus, helminths and protozoa to the freeze/thawing of both
   aerobically and anaerobically digested sludges is examined. Fecal
   coliforms, fecal streptococci, and plaque forming units are chosen as
   the commonly used indicators of bacteria and viruses, respectively in
   wastewater sludges. Pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella), virus (Poliovirus)
   and parasites (Ascaris suum and Cryptosporidium parvum) tested in the
   second phase are chosen as sample microorganisms in their respective
   classes. Freeze/thaw sludge conditioning is proven to be an effective
   means of removing most pathogenic microorganisms. Fecal streptococci are
   found to be the best indicator of the effectiveness of freeze/thawing on
   enteric bacteria. Results of this study indicate that freeze/thaw
   conditioning coupled with sludge digestion can significantly enhance the
   overall pathogenic microorganism reduction achieved in a wastewater
   treatment plant. Added effectiveness by freeze/thaw treatment may become
   critical for a plant in meeting the pathogen reduction requirements by
   U.S. regulations prior to any practice of land application or land
   disposal of sludge.}},

Abstract = {{This work compares antibiotic resistance of 870 E. coli strains isolated
   from domestic raw sewage, in the effluent from aerobic lagoons and
   activated sludge plants. Efficiency of both treatment systems in
   removing faecal coliforms (FC) has also been evaluated. Reduction of FC
   was greater in the aerobic lagoon (99.99\% in summer) than in the
   activated sludge system (91.30\% in summer). Although the aerobic lagoon
   is efficient in removing faecal coliforms in comparisons with the
   activated sludge plant, it discharges these bacteria into receptor
   environments in larger (30.10(3) CFU/100 ml) or smaller quantities
   (9.10(2) CFU/100 ml) according to season. Among these FC, E. coli which
   was relatively high (on average 80\%) constitutes a health problem when
   it is resistant to antibiotics. As for percentage of global
   antibiotic-resistance (evaluated by Gallery ATBG-method), the E. coli
   strains isolated from the effluent of the aerobic lagoon showed
   significantly higher antibiotic-resistance (34.66\%) than those isolated
   from domestic sewage (23\%). In the activated sludge, the percentage of
   antibiotic resistant strains (resistance to at least one antibiotic)
   showed seasonal changes in the inflow and outflow water samples. The
   increase of the percentage of antibiotic resistant strains of E. coli in
   the outflow of the lagoon system is probably related to the selection of
   antibiotic resistant strains by this kind of treatment. Transfer of
   antibiotic-resistance between E. coli strains can occur in the
   wastewaters treated by this system. Survival experiments on two strains
   of E. coli, E. coli resistant to seven antibiotics and E. coli 0126:B16
   sensitive to the 15 tested antibiotics, isolated from the environment,
   show the ability of resistant bacteria to survive better than sensitive
   ones in waste water treated in lagoons.}},

   However the air stripping process simply transfers the contaminants from

   (u.v.) photooxidation for treating the off gas from air stripping is
   examined. Subsequent papers will address linking u.v. photooxidation

Abstract = {{One of the distinctive features of the IAWPRC model is the
   death-regeneration cycle. The death-regeneration cycle is equivalent to
   the endogenous approach under conditions where there is no accumulation
   of intermediates. Experimental evidence would appear to indicate that
   hydrolysis may be the rate controlling step even at 20 degrees C. At
   lower temperatures preliminary studies indicate that hydrolysis is
   appreciably slower than either death or synthesis. Changes in the
   quantity of particulate slowly biodegradable COD will influence the
   determination of the net rate of endogenous respiration by batch
   digestion and the gross death and decay coefficient used in the IAWPRC
   model. Where hydrolysis is substantially slower than death a net
   accumulation of slowly biodegradable COD can be expected. This could
   explain the higher production of solids at lower temperatures even when
   a large percentage of the feed is rapidly biodegradable COD.}},

Abstract = {{A fatal case of legionnaires' disease in a British tourist was
   contracted in a hotel on a creek island. The air-conditioning system and
   the hot water system were checked for Legionella pneumophila.
   L.pneumophila ser 1 was investigated at two points, from a mixing valve
   and from a hot water tap at concentrations of 2000 and 3000 cfu/L
   respectively. Water temperature and abscence of free residual chlorine
   in the water are thought to be the factors that promoted the
   L.pneumophila proliferation in the water piping. Age and bad physical
   condition of the victim were probably of significance.}},

   TMSH gave high reaction yields for the chlorophenols only. The

   ensured generally high recoveries from a drinking water matrix and may
   be carried out in routine work. Solid phase extraction with commercial

Abstract = {{The introduction of on-line sensors of nutrient salt concentrations on
   wastewater treatment plants opens a wide new area of modelling
   wastewater processes. Time series models of these processes are very
   useful for gaining insight in real time operation of wastewater
   treatment systems which deal with variable influent flows and pollution
   loads. In this paper nonlinear time series models describing the
   variations of the ammonia and nitrate concentrations in the aeration
   tanks of a biological nutrient removal WWTP are established. The models
   proposed herein are identified by combining well-known theory of the
   processes, i.e. including prior knowledge, with the significant effects
   found in data by using statistical identification methods. Rates of the
   biochemical and hydraulic processes are identified by statistical
   methods and the related constants for the biochemical processes are
   estimated assuming Monod kinetics. The models only include those
   hydraulic and kinetic parameters, which have shown to be significant in
   a statistical sense, and hence they can be quantified. The application
   potential of these models is on-line control, because the present state
   of the plant is given by the variables of the models which are
   continuously updated as new information from the on-line sensors becomes
   available.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates sewage sludge conditioning with optimized
   combinations of a polymer and skeleton builders prior to fiter pressing.
   The objective is to produce a more porous and incompressible cake
   structure needed for successful sludge dewatering. Response surface
   methodology (RSM) was used as the experimental design strategy to
   optimize sludge conditioning, based on the resulting net sludge solids
   yield. Fly ash from a municipal sludge incinerator, cement kiln dust,
   and bagasse were found to be successful skeleton builders for dewatering
   primary sludge from a wastewater treatment plant that processes a
   mixture of industrial and municipal effluents. The commercial product
   CALGON WT-2640, a 6\% by weight aqueous polymer solution, was used as
   chemical conditioner. The optimum conditioning strategy when using
   flyash as a skeleton builder was found to be the addition of a polymer
   dose of 1.1\% and a fly ash dose of 151\%, both based on the original
   dry solid content of the sludge. This combined treatment increased the
   net sludge solid yield by 580\% when compared to conditioning only with
   polymer. The optimum conditioning strategy when using cement kiln dust
   was to add the same dose of polymer as before, and a cement dust dose of
   173\%. This combined treatment increased the net sludge solid yield by
   96\%. For conditioning with bagasse, a polymer dose of 1.33\% and a
   bagasse dose of 37\% was the optimum strategy. The resulting increase in
   net yield was 1260\%.}},

Abstract = {{The previously developed multiphase model is applied to numerically
   simulate migration of a lighter-than-water immiscible organic
   contaminant in the vicinity of the groundwater table in a field-scale
   contamination scenario. The numerical simulations show that the
   contaminated zone consists of two regions: the saturated region where
   the soil saturation with respect to the contaminant is at a maximum
   level, and the diffused region where the soil saturation varies from a
   maximum to a residual level. Strong spatial variation is predicted in
   the contaminant saturation profile, and an inflection point may exist in
   the profile. The simulations clearly show the development of a so called
   pancake over the saturated groundwater system with time, and project the
   resultant depression of the water interface. It is shown that the
   contaminant penetrates deep into the groundwater system and spreads
   laterally in both directions and at a rate much greater than that
   commonly derived based on the groundwater flow.}},

Abstract = {{Two laboratory scale extended aeration treatment systems (EATS) were
   built to study their nutrient removal performance before and after the
   introduction of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) controlled aeration.
   Effects of various ORP set points (40, 70, 110 and 180 mV) and zoning of
   the aeration tank (AT) were examined. Each system had a 901 aeration
   tank and the operating HRT and SRT were 20 h and 20 days, respectively.
   Synthetic wastewater was used and the F/M ratios ranged from 0.13 to
   0.15gCOD/gMLSS/d. All experimental runs including the control yielded a
   similar COD removal efficiency of 96.4 +/- 0.4\% and an effluent COD of
   14.4 +/- 1.3 mg. This indicates that ORP controlled aeration had no
   significant impact on the carbonaceous removal of the EATS. Very good
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) removal was obtained when there was a
   small anoxic selector (3.81) at the head of the AT and the tank zoned
   into a main ORP zone (721) followed by an aerobic zone (18.1). The
   selector was found very useful in the prevention and curing of bulking
   as well as in the removal of P. It effectively denitrified the nitrate
   from the return sludge stream and caused significant P release, that is
   important to subsequent P uptake in the ORP and aerobic zones. An
   optimum ORP set point of 110 mV was found. The aeration pattern was
   characterized by having an equal time length of aeration and
   non-aeration. The achievable total nitrogen (TN) removal was 93\% with a
   residual TN of only 2.94 mg/l (N). Excellent P removal of 99.5 +/- 0.1\%
   was attained under an ORP set point range of 70-180 mV. P was reduced to
   0.05 +/- 0.01 mg/l (P) in the effluent.}},

   Experiments were carried out modifying the variables temperature, pH and

   field and to evaluate the radiation flow rate absorbed, the Line Source
   Spherical Emission Model is used. This model, with a simple mechanism of
   three steps proposed for the photodecomposition reaction, provides the
   determination of the quantum yields. They are well correlated by an

Abstract = {{Reductive dechlorination of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) to
   2,4-dichlorophenol and to 4-chlorophenol is found in mixed methanogenic
   cultures enriched from municipal sludge digesters. In this study,
   electron donors, including hydrogen, acetate and fructose, were
   effectively converted to methane and supported this dehalogenation in
   periods of 2 to 4 weeks. When bromoethanesulfonic acid (BESA) and
   vancomycin were used, dechlorination and methanogenesis were strongly
   affected. With hydrogen, BESA nearly completely inhibited lithotrophic
   methanogenesis; acetate accumulated from lithotrophic acetogenesis and
   dehalogenation proceeded. Vancomycin, however, inhibited dehalogenation
   while methanogenesis was not affected. With acetate, BESA completely
   inhibited methanogenesis and substantially slowed dehalogenation; the
   acetate was not used. Vancomycin, on the other hand, stopped
   dehalogenation, while methanogenesis proceeded. With fructose plus
   titanium citrate, BESA inhibited methanogenesis; acetate and propionate
   accumulated, and dehalogenation proceeded; vancomycin inhibited
   dehalogenation. Autoclaved controls had neither dehalogenation nor
   methanogenesis. These results point to biological dehalogenation by
   eubacteria, rather than methanogens. In the case of acetate, where both
   inhibitors effectively stopped dehalogenation, they also indicate a
   syntrophic relation between acetoclastic methanogens and the
   dehalogenating bacteria. In further studies with 2,4,6-TCP
   concentrations ranging up to 160 mg/l there was increasing toxicity to
   methanogens and changes in accumulation of fatty acids, but
   dehalogenation persisted at the highest concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A method based on isocratic high performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) with u.v. detection at 229 nm was developed for the routine
   determination of dissolved nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) in waste
   waters. Gas stripping into ethyl acetate was chosen to extract and
   pre-concentrate the NPEOs after evaluation of a number of alternative
   procedures. The extract was cleaned-up by ion-exchange chromatography to
   remove co-extracted anionic and cationic surfactants. This also removed
   the majority of non-surfactant contaminants arising from the sample
   matrix. Total NPEOs were determined from the single peak obtained on an
   octadecylsilica column using 90:10 methanol/water as mobile phase. The
   presence of an NPEO mixture in the extract was confirmed and oligomers
   with 4 or more ethoxylate groups determined using a cyanosilica column
   with 95:5 acetonitrile/water as mobile phase. Lower oligomers were
   determined on an octadecylsilica column with a higher carbon loading
   (10\% or greater) using 98:2 acetonitrile/water as mobile phase. The
   recovery of NPEOs was better than 80\% for most oligomers and for total
   NPEOs. Adsorption onto the filter paper is the major cause of losses.
   Recovery of the first oligomer was lower (60\%); nonylphenol was not
   recovered at all and should be determined by an alternative method.
   Losses resulting from incomplete extraction due to lesser surfactant
   properties may also be significant for these two species. For total
   NPEOs, the detection limit was 0.04 mg/l, accuracy was better than 80\%
   and precision 4\% or better. For individual oligomers, the detection
   limit was below 1 mu g/l. The procedure was shown to be applicable to
   the analysis of NPEOs in a variety of waste water samples containing
   significant physical and chemical interferences.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, theoretical analysis of the complexed metal treatment by
   conventional hydroxide precipitation is made. The analysis is aimed to
   evaluate the mechanism of ligand-sharing effect of metals which are
   added to wastewater to ensure effective removal of complexed heavy
   metals. Theoretical expression of the analysis is made using phase
   diagrams. Cadmium, copper and nickel are selected as heavy metals. EDTA,
   NTA and succinic acid are selected as organic complex formers of
   different strengths. Calcium is used as the ligand binding agent.
   Theoretical solutions are made for, single metal-single ligand system
   and several metal and ligand combinations in the closed system and
   single metal-single ligand in the open system. Theoretical solutions are
   interpreted considering the solubility, stability and ionization
   constants and their relative magnitudes. Experimental studies are
   conducted to check the theoretical predictions. Result indicate that
   high pH precipitation is applicable to the cases where organic ligand
   can be effectively bound by calcium or any other coagulant or pH
   adjustment agent thus freeing the heavy metal to form hydroxide or
   carbonate solids. Theoretical diagrams can be used to predict the
   favorable conditions for precipitation and as a guide to determine the
   operating conditions.}},

   various parameters on solutions at steady-state in a kinetic model for
   wastewater stabilization ponds. An analytic method of study is developed
   together with a function of evaluation whose value provides a measure
   for stabilizing the results. It was found that the stability of the

Abstract = {{The aim of this research was to investigate the possibility of using a
   combination of chlorine dioxide and chlorine, instead of using each of
   them as a single disinfectant for the disinfection of effluents from
   municipal sewage treatment plants, in order to obtain an environmentally
   safe source of water which can be reused for a variety of purposes. The
   main task was to investigate whether the combination of the two
   disinfectants maintains their advantages and decrease their
   disadvantages.
   Residual chlorine dioxide, chlorine, chlorite ion and Most Probable
   Number (MPN) per 100 ml of survived total coliforms, fecal coliforms,
   fecal streptococci and E-coliphages were determined as a function of
   these disinfectants doses and contact times. The combination produced a
   relatively stable high residual of both disinfectants, reduced the
   concentration of the undesirable chlorite ion, while increasing the
   concentration of chlorine dioxide. In all doses of the combined
   disinfectants there was an improvement in the destruction of the
   indicator pathogenic microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{The copper complexation capacity (CC) and the conditional formation
   constant of the resulting complexes, beta', have been measured in the
   Pisuerga River at its passage through the town of Valladolid, by means
   of a voltammetric titration of the water at `'natural pH'' (acetate
   buffer) using DPASV as analytical technique. The effect of both sampling
   site and sampling time on CC and beta' have been evaluated, finding that
   only sampling site has a significant effect on CC, whereas both factors
   affected beta'. We have also found a significant correlation (at P =
   0.05) of CC with Chemical Oxygen Demand and no correlation between CC
   and Dissolved Organic Carbon. The CC of Pisuerga River has been
   monitored during a 127-week period, finding a progressive increase of
   its level with the time, a significant correlation with the stream flow,
   as well as a periodical behaviour that has been elucidated with the aid
   of signal processing techniques (smoothing and Fourier transform),
   finding long term variations than can be attributed to seasonal changes
   in the river stream flow.}},

Abstract = {{Coliforms at levels of up to 4 x 10(4) per 100 ml were detected in the
   outlet of an open holding service reservoir for domestic water supplied
   with chlorinated water that contained no more than 3 coliforms per 100
   ml and these were identified as mostly Enterobacter cloacae and some
   Citrobacter freundii. These were also the coliforms isolated most
   frequently from Melbourne Water catchment reservoirs. Growth of these
   coliform organisms occur within the holding reservoir. Cypress trees
   (Cupressus macrocarpa) deposited some 6000 kg of leaves into the
   reservoir per annum and this had produced a 3 cm sediment layer of
   decaying leaves. In the laboratory coliforms and other heterotrophs grew
   in water containing cypress leaves achieving populations of 3 x 10(5)
   per 100 ml and 4 x 10(8) per ml respectively. Cold water leaf extracts
   supported the growth of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae,
   Escherichia coli, Salmonella derby and uncharacterised heterotrophs
   present in the reservoir sediments. Hot water extracts, however,
   contained inhibitors of growth of all species tested except for
   Enterobacter cloacae. Growth of coliform organisms and other
   heterotrophs was probably supported by nutrients derived from cypress
   leaves. In order to preserve the quality of water, reservoirs should be
   protected from receiving cypress leaves.}},

Abstract = {{The ozonation of atrazine in water has been studied under different
   conditions of ozone partial pressure, pH, temperature and presence of
   hydroxyl radical scavengers. The process mainly develops through radical
   reactions, even at pH 2, probably due to the presence of traces of
   impurities in the starting material. The rate constant of the direct
   reaction between ozone and atrazine at pH 2 has been determined and
   expressed as a function of temperature. Thus, at 20 degrees C the rate
   constant was found to be 4.5 M(-1) s(-1) the energy of activation being
   18.8 kJ mol(-1). A model formed by mol balance equations of atrazine and
   ozone, the latter in the liquid and gas phases, with the ozone
   decomposition rate based on the Staehelin and Hoigne mechanism allowed
   the determination of the concentrations of these species at different
   experimental conditions. The aqueous solution of atrazine is
   characterized by a hydroxyl radical initiating rate factor which
   accounts for other radical reactions not included in the basic ozone
   decomposition mechanism. With this factor deviations between
   experimental and calculated concentrations of atrazine are less than +/-
   15\% in most of the cases.}},

Abstract = {{Recharge of sewage effluents may lead to contamination of groundwater
   with viruses. The goal of this research was to quantify virus removal in
   representative subsurface transport conditions. Soil column and batch
   studies were conducted to evaluate how virus type, effluent type and
   water saturation affect virus adsorption and removal. Three viruses were
   used: MS2 and PRD1 bacteriophages and poliovirus type 1. In the first
   column study, secondary- or tertiary-treated sewage containing the
   viruses percolated through coarse-sand columns under unsaturated
   conditions. In the second column study, the viruses suspended in
   secondary-treated sewage percolated through the columns under saturated
   or unsaturated conditions. A batch adsorption study was conducted to
   determine equilibrium adsorption of these viruses to the sand.
   Effluent type had no significant effect on first-order virus removal
   coefficients or retardation of virus transport. Virus `'removal'' was
   considered to be inactivation or irreversible adsorption. Unsaturated
   conditions resulted in an average removal coefficient (mu(s) = 0.31
   h(-1)) more than three times greater than saturated conditions (mu(s) =
   0.095 h(-1)), a significant difference at the 0.01 level. Poliovirus had
   a greater retardation coefficient (R = 5.2) than the bacteriophages
   (MS2, R = 1.4; and PRD1, R = 2.2), a significant difference at the 0.001
   level. Column retardations of virus transport were only 0.8-8.0\% of
   that predicted by adsorption coefficients determined from the batch
   studies.
   Equations developed in this paper may aid in estimating virus removal
   during recharge of effluents if the water residence times in ponds, the
   vadose zone and the aquifer are known.}},

   treatment plant of Guardamar de Segura (Alicante, Spain) during a period
   of two years. This plant uses a lagoon type system on which very little
   information has been published regarding surfactant removal. The ponds
   are usually designed as a function of the organic load-Biological Oxygen
   Demand (BOD5) to be treated and they are currently located in
   communities not larger than 50,000 inhabitants. Both LAS and SPC's have
   been monitored using specific analytical techniques. BOD removal in the
   treatment plant monitored was nearly 90\% which justifies this type of
   system for small communities. Total LAS removal was very high, >97\% and
   it was found that the largest part of the removal was due to
   biodegradation (>83\%) with almost total mineralization.}},

Abstract = {{The results of a laboratory assessment of the performance
   characteristics of a fish monitor, designed for the detection of toxic
   pollution events at drinking water intakes, are presented. The equipment
   assessed was developed by WRc in the U.K. and monitors significant
   changes in fish ventilation frequency as an indicator of the occurrence
   of a toxic pollutant. Rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) were used in these
   trials being most commonly used in operation. Data from a trial period
   of 1 year were analysed to establish sensitivity to ten test substances
   and the estimated rate of false responses for the sensitivities quoted.
   Comparison with trout acute toxicity data (96 h LC(50)) show responses
   at between 10 and 250\% of the LC(50) with a response within 40 min.
   Comparison is also with 24 h SNARLs (suggested no adverse response
   levels) for humans where this is available. The monitor is capable of
   responding at concentrations below or close to these levels where the
   test substance could be expected to produce acute toxic symptoms, but
   the concentration of response may be considerably higher than the SNARL
   where toxic symptoms are of a chronic, long-term nature. The estimated
   rate of false responses for the monitor was between 1 in 3 and 1 in 5
   months.}},

   sought to determine whether the established performance could be

   responses. The study used data collected at two field test sites over a
   one year period. The main factors causing false responses were
   associated with physical disturbance: entry into fish monitor rooms and
   interruptions in water flow. Sudden changes in water conditions
   resulting from influences of extreme high tides were also identified as
   causing responses at one site. There was no evidence of normal changes
   in river water conditions causing false responses, nor was there any
   evidence of the occurrence of contaminants at either site. After taking
   into account responses resulting from the factors mentioned, the false
   response rate was found to be at or below that estimated from laboratory
   trials (1 in 3 months).}},

Abstract = {{This paper includes the results of an experimental investigation carried
   out on thickening of excess sludge to observe the phosphate behaviour in
   the presence and absence of nitrate and to study the effect of the
   wastewater treatment process on sludge properties which have a great
   influence on phosphate release to the supernatant of gravity thickeners.
   The main results obtained are as follows: (1) the rate of phosphate
   release under anaerobic conditions is influenced by the chemicals which
   are used in the aeration tank to precipitate P. In case of no P
   precipitation, the P released to the supernatant after 24 h detention
   time (DT) was about 6\% of the influent P load of the wastewater
   treatment plant; (2) as initial nitrate concentration increases, the
   phosphate release rate decreases; (3) up to a DT of 12 (sludge age, 3.5
   days) to 20 h (30 days), the N release to the supernatant is rather low
   and can be neglected in regard to the wastewater treatment process; (4)
   a DT of less than 18-24 h is advantageous in regard to nutrient release
   for thickening of ES in case of activated sludge treatment plant without
   primary sedimentation process.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Portable test kits, which are accepted as analytical techniques for
   measuring dissolved inorganic nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate were
   compared with standard methods in terms of analytical performance,
   colour stability, chemical background of water solutions, salinity
   interference, filtration and storage procedures. The kit detector, a
   Hach DR/2000, was also compared to a laboratory spectrophotometer, a
   Shimadzu UV-2100. Absorbance measurements indicated that the Hach
   colorimetric detector is a reliable spectrophotometric sensor and
   compared well to the Shimadzu UV-2I00, but the former has the advantage
   of being more portable, versatile and cheaper than the latter. Detection
   limits for nitrite, nitrate and phosphate were 0.300, 0.657 and 0.162,
   and 0.048, 0.049 and 0.050 mu M for the kits and standard procedures,
   respectively. Molecular absorption coefficients achieved for phosphate
   were 21,600 and 22,700 (M.cm)(-1), and for nitrate 29,900 and 47,900
   (M.cm)(-1), respectively. However, for nitrate the coefficients differed
   markedly {[}12,000 and 44,500 (M.cm)(-1)]. Reagent blanks from the test
   kits were higher than those from the standard techniques. Differences
   between filtered and non-filtered water samples from aquaculture
   facilities and other environments were found. The full chemical reaction
   (colour) of the kit reagents proved to be stable after 40 min.
   Information on spectral response, kinetics, multi-point calibration
   curves and storage of kit reagents is also provided. The studied test
   kits for determining nitrite and phosphate can be used in monitoring
   natural waters. But for nitrate, salt interference should be taken into
   account.}},

Abstract = {{The biodegradation of 3-nitrobenzenesulfonate (3-NBS) or
   3-aminobenzenesulfonate (3-ABS) was examined in a laboratory trickling
   filter device containing one of six activated sludges as the
   biocatalyst. No activated sludge from four communal treatment plants
   could degrade 3-NBS or 3-ABS. In contrast, each of the sludges from two
   plants treating wastes from the textile industry was able to completely
   degrade 3-NBS or 3-ABS. Under certain conditions, communal activated
   sludge could acclimate to degrade 3-NBS, even though inoculation with a
   degradative sludge was a more efficient process. In the absence of a
   carbon source, the degradative ability of trickling filters was retained
   for at least 1 week; thereafter, an adaptation phase was required before
   rapid and extensive degradation of recovered 3-NBS. Degradation was
   monitored by global parameters (DOC and release of CO2) and specific
   determinations of substrate (HPLC). The global parameters indicated
   incomplete metabolism of 3-NBS, but this effect was found to be due to
   the presence of a non-degraded impurity (5\%), 4-NBS, found in most
   commercial preparations of 3-NBS.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of different rates of endogenous nitrate respiration
   due to biomass stratification throughout the depth of a sludge blanket
   is essential to assess the factors affecting the sludge rising in
   secondary clarifiers. In this study, an extension of the solids flux
   theory in conjunction with nitrate mass balance was used to model the
   fate of nitrate in a sludge settling column. The model-predicted nitrate
   concentrations agree well with those experimentally determined. A new
   term, sludge stability index, was introduced to reflect the sludge
   rising time and the corresponding critical nitrate concentration
   necessary for causing sludge rising. The model predicted well the
   observed sludge rising times occurring under batch settling column
   experiments with initial biomass and nitrate concentration ranging from
   2000 to 5000 mg 1(-1) and 10 to 30 mg-N1(-1), respectively. Furthermore,
   simulation results indicated that both the sludge rising time and CNC
   are significantly affected by k(ENR).}},

Abstract = {{Although the molecular size distribution of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM) can affect the performance of biological wastewater treatment
   systems, limited information is available on the macromolecule breakdown
   in these reactors. In this study, we examined the degradation of a
   single, well-defined polysaccharide (dextran; 70,000 average molecular
   weight) in axenic culture using a dextran-degrading bacterium isolated
   from wastewater (CDC Group IIi). In suspended batch and continuous
   cultures fed dextran as a sole carbon source, there was an accumulation
   of both intermediate (<10,000 amu) and small (<1000 amu) molecular
   weight carbohydrates in solution. In batch culture, the maximum increase
   in concentration of intermediate-sized carbohydrates was 14\% (17 mg
   1(-1)) of the initial dextran concentration. In continuous culture, 54\%
   of the effluent polysaccharides were <10,000 amu although the influent
   contained less than 6\% of this size fraction. This represents an
   overall net production in the small and intermediate sized carbohydrate
   concentrations in the chemostat of 143 mg 1(-1) (26\%) and 116 mg 1(-1)
   (21\%), under conditions where only 6\% (34 mg 1(-1)) of carbohydrates
   entering the chemostat were completely removed. These results indicate
   that polysaccharides can be released back into solution before being
   completely utilized by suspended microbes, producing large
   transformations in size distributions with only minimal changes in total
   carbohydrate concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Phenol oxidizing enzymes such as peroxidases, laccases and polyphenol
   oxidases (tyrosinases) have been proposed for use in wastewater
   treatment. Few of the previous studies with these enzymes have focused
   on characteristics of reaction products relevant to waste treatment
   objectives, which must be known if enzyme technology is to be developed
   as a viable treatment process. In addition, little attention has been
   paid to the potential differences among different phenol oxidizing
   enzymes with respect to product characteristics and other factors of
   importance for full-scale applications. Work in this study focused on
   chromatographic and acute toxicity (by Microtox(R) assay) analysis of
   reaction products from the enzyme catalyzed oxidation of several
   regulated phenolic compounds, using the enzymes chloroperoxidase,
   horseradish peroxidase, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and
   mushroom polyphenol oxidase. The nature and distribution of reaction
   products from a given target phenol depended on the enzyme used and on
   reaction pH for otherwise constant reaction conditions. In some cases,
   differences in product characteristics (as judged through
   chromatography) corresponded to differences in toxicity as well. The
   compounds 4-chlorophenol, p-cresol and pentachlorophenol were detoxified
   by at least one of the enzymes tested, whereas enzymatic oxidation of
   2-nitrophenol, 4-nitrophenol, 2-chlorophenol, 0-cresol and phenol either
   increased the toxicity or had a negligible effect.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of Phormidium sp. to grow in anaerobically digested swine
   waste medium and the use of this organism for tertiary biotreatment of
   wastewater was evaluated. In addition to monitoring the growth of
   Phormidium, the removal of total phosphorus (total P), orthophosphate
   (P-PO4), nitrates (N-NO3) and ammonium (N-NH4) were also measured.
   Dilutions from 50 to 10\% of the secondary effluent were tested and
   results compared with Dauta's medium which was used as a control.
   Results obtained at 25\% dilution in 21. graduated cylinders were: 100\%
   removal of orthophosphate, 87\% of nitrate, 68\% of total phosphate and
   48\% of ammonium ion. Removals obtained in a carrousel type reactor
   were: 48\% for orthophosphate, 30\% for nitrate, 63\% for total
   phosphorus and 100\% for ammonium ion. These removals were higher in
   both cases than those obtained in Dauta's medium. The total ammonium
   uptake for the 25\% dilution by Phormidium sp. was 7.65 mg/l-d in the
   glass cylinders and 19.93 mg/l-d in the carrousel reactor.}},

Abstract = {{Biotransformations of several chlorinated phenols were studied in
   aerobic cultures enriched on glucose, methane, phenol and toluene and
   acclimated to 16 chlorinated compounds. The toluene enrichment culture
   degraded pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP),
   while the cultures enriched on glucose, methane or phenol showed little
   or no activity. The phenol and toluene enriched cultures rapidly
   degraded 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) but not 2,6-DCP or 2,4,5-TCP.
   Degradation of chlorophenols by the toluene enriched culture did not
   occur endogenously but continued when another carbon source, acetate,
   was introduced. Degradation of chlorophenols proceeded after starvation
   and in the presence of chloramphenicol, suggesting constitutive
   enzymatic activity. The initial steps of PCP degradation by the toluene
   enriched culture involved dechlorination and hydroxylation of an ortho
   carbon to form tetrachlorocatechol. Tetrachloroguaiacol was identified
   as a minor, dead-end metabolite of PCP degradation by the toluene
   enriched culture.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the presence of molecular oxygen on the adsorption of
   volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in distilled Milli-Q water and in
   water supplemented with background organic matter (BOM) is evaluated.
   Experiments are conducted under conditions where molecular oxygen is
   present in the test environment (oxic adsorption), and where oxygen is
   absent from the test environment (anoxic adsorption). Adsorption
   isotherms for tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) in
   Milli-Q water showed no impact of the presence of oxygen on their
   adsorption behavior, while adsorption isotherms for
   cis-1,2-dichloroethene (DCE) showed higher capacities under oxic
   conditions. VOC adsorption isotherms in BOM are conducted for three
   initial concentration sets of VOCs and two initial concentration sets of
   BOM. VOC isotherms collected under oxic and anoxic conditions in water
   supplemented with BOM showed that by keeping the initial concentration
   ratio of VOCs to BOM constant, the adsorption behavior of the VOC is
   very similar. VOC isotherms in BOM conducted under oxic conditions
   generally showed lower capacities than the anoxic isotherms. The ideal
   adsorbed solution theory (IAST) successfully predicted the VOCs anoxic
   adsorption isotherms in BOM. However, the IAST model did not predict the
   VOCs oxic adsorption isotherms in BOM. Analysis of the data was
   conducted using the isotherm parameters of the VOCs in Milli-Q water,
   and correlation parameters using a four fictive component approach for
   the BOM. The poor agreement between experimental data and model
   predictions obtained for the oxic isotherms is attributed to the
   presence of molecular oxygen which promotes conglomeration of BOM on the
   surface of carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Distribution coefficients (K-d) were used to estimate the most important
   geochemical phases within the suspended particulate matter (SPM) pool
   for sorption of Cd, Cu and Zn. Given that pH effects were expected to be
   minimal, as the Don is a well buffered system, the possible influence of
   secondary environmental variables {[}temperature, dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC), dissolved Ca2+ and NaCl] on trace metal partitioning
   between SPM and the dissolved phase was evaluated using a series of
   multiple linear regressions for total (KdT)as well as the phase specific
   (K(d)L leachable phase; K(d)R reducible phase; and KdO oxidizable phase)
   distribution coefficient estimates. The three metals varied in their
   sorptions patterns. Cd and Zn showed the same relative affinities for
   three SPM pools (leachable = reducible > oxidizable), while Cu
   affinities ranked oxidizable = leachable > reducible. Secondary
   environmental factors were identified as more important influences on
   trace metal partitioning than pH. Temperature and NaCl (from road salt
   runoff) were found to be key environmental variables influencing trace
   metal partitioning. A decrease in water temperature caused decreases in
   the accumulation of Cd, Cu and Zn in the particulate pool. Increasing
   NaCl concentrations decreased the concentrations of Cd and Zn associated
   with the particulate leachable phase and the Cd, Zn and Cu content in
   the oxidizable SPM phase. These results suggest that in running waters
   during winter months, or even during summer months in the hypolimnia of
   sufficiently deep lakes, a relatively higher proportion of these metals
   remains in the dissolved and potentially more bioavailable pool.}},

Abstract = {{Since biosorption is considered an important step in the removal of
   organochlorines in secondary treatment systems from pulp and paper mill
   effluent, the role of biosorption in the removal of high molecular
   weight organochlorine (HMW AOX) was studied. UItrafiltered (> 1000 Da)
   total mill effluent was used as the sorbate and municipal sewage sludge
   as the sorbent. Eight different parameters were tested: contact time,
   cell viability, cell concentration, sorbate concentration, desorption,
   cell type, sorbate type and temperature. Biosorption equilibrium was
   reached in the first 30 min of an experiment and the removal of the high
   molecular weight organochlorine was independent of cell viability. The
   biosorption was characterized by the Freundlich isotherm {[}Q(mg/g VSS)
   = KC1/n, C = AOX concentration (mg/l)]; the observed values for the
   Freundlich coefficients K and 1/n were 1.83 and 0.53, respectively. The
   Langmuir isotherm {[}Q = 7.5 C/(3.2 + C)] provided a better
   characterization for biosorption of HMW AOX since it predicted a
   saturation biomass phase concentration of 7.5 mg Cl/g VSS at high AOX
   concentrations. The maximum percentage removal of HMW AOX was 70\% at a
   biomass concentration of 2.0 g VSS/1 or higher. About 8\% of the
   organochlorines desorbed from live biomass after 24 h indicating that
   the process is not readily reversible. Based on the experiments at
   various temperatures, the enthalpy of sorption was found to be -4 kJ/mol
   Cl.}},

Abstract = {{A new wastewater treatment process, which is named herein `'the
   anaerobic fluidized pellet bed (AFPB) bioreactor process'', is developed
   for simultaneous removal of suspended solids, organic matter, phosphorus
   and nitrogen. This process is composed of two stages: an upflow AFPB
   bioreactor for the first stage and an activated sludge aeration tank
   with a sludge settling zone for the second stage. The first stage, the
   AFPB bioreactor, is introduced as an alternative to the primary
   clarifier. In this stage, polymerized aluminum chloride and a weak
   anionic polymer are dosed in order to coagulate suspended solids,
   colloidal matters and phosphorus and to generate sludge pellets that are
   large enough to settle rapidly. The excess sludge pellets are withdrawn
   from the bottom of the AFPB bioreactor. The second stage is primarily
   designed for the usual aerobic biological treatment of organic matter.
   In addition, as the aeration tank is operated at solid retention times
   long enough to ensure the growth of nitrifiers even at temperatures
   below 10 degrees C, high nitrification is achieved in the second stage.
   The nitrified effluent is recycled from the second stage to the AFPB
   bioreactor, and denitrification completely accomplished under the
   anaerobic conditions. The organic matter necessary for the
   denitrification is supplied through anaerobic biological hydrolysis of
   the sludge pellets in the AFPB bioreactor. With a total retention time
   of 4 h (2 h in the AFPB bioreactor and 2 h in the aeration tank) and a
   recirculation ratio of 300\% based on the influent flow rate, the
   average removal efficiencies of suspended solids, total COD and total
   nitrogen are found to be 99, 95 and 75\%, respectively. Total phosphorus
   was below the detectable level in most cases.}},

Abstract = {{Field observations of linear alkylbenzenesulfonates (LAS) were conducted
   in the Nogawa river, a polluted shallow stream located in Tokyo, from
   1987 to 1990. LAS concentrations decreased from similar to 1 mg 1(-1) in
   the upper stream receiving untreated domestic wastewater to less than
   0.05 mg 1(-1) at 6 km downstream. Within the upper portion of a 1.8 km
   concrete open channel (travelling time of water: 1-3 h), more than 80\%
   of LAS were removed. The half-lives for LAS of similar to 1 h were
   considerably shorter than those obtained from biodegradation experiments
   using only the river water (several tens of hours). Biodegradation
   experiments using biofilm collected from the stream bed indicated that
   LAS are much more rapidly degraded under the existence of biofilm.
   Measurement of LAS in the biofilm indicated negligible LAS accumulation
   in the stream bed. The field observations and laboratory experiments
   indicated that biodegradation by the stream bed biofilm is the
   predominant removal mechanism of LAS in the urban shallow stream.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic humic substances (AHS) were isolated from peatbog water by
   adsorption (1) on diethylaminoethyl cellulose (DEAE-C) and (2) on
   Amberlite XAD-2 (XAD) to compare yields of the methods and the
   composition of the isolated AHS. To provide a detailed comparison, the
   isolates were fractionated using size-exclusion and
   hydrophobic-interaction chromatography on Sephadex G-50. The fractions
   were characterized by ultraviolet-visible, infrared and C-13-nuclear
   magnetic spectroscopies and analyzed for elemental, functional-group,
   carbohydrate and amino acid compositions. More AHS adsorbed onto DEAE-C
   than onto XAD-2 (94 and 74\%, respectively). However, only 76\% of the
   AHS adsorbed onto DEAE-C was recovered using 0.1 M NaOH, whereas 98\% of
   the AHS adsorbed onto XAD was released by consecutive elution with 1 M
   NH4OH (91\%) and methanol (7\%). Four main fractions of different
   composition were obtained from each of the alkali-desorbed AHS samples
   by Sephadex-gel chromatography. General agreement was found in relative
   amounts, spectroscopic characteristics and composition of corresponding
   fractions of both isolates except nitrogen content, which was
   significantly higher in AHS isolated with XAD, apparently due to the
   reaction of AHS with NH4OH used for the desorption from the resin.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus exchanges within the sediment-water interface coupled with
   several parameters were studied in several reservoirs with geologically
   different catchment basins and different trophic levels in Morocco and
   France.
   The results showed that these exchanges were regulated by a combination
   of the physical-chemical variability of the environment, the geological
   composition of the catchment basins and the trophic status of the lake.
   In the hypereutrophic Villerest reservoir, iron-bound phosphorus is the
   major form of phosphorus trapped by the sediment whereas, in Moroccan
   reservoirs, calcium-bound phosphorus prevailed.
   We suggest that drastic control of phosphorus input into waters be
   carried out via a large dephosphorization program of the tributaries to
   avoid bloom formation in the Villerest reservoir and calcium-bound
   phosphorus dissociation with upward release of bioavailable phosphorus.}},

   independently of the wastewater dilution, mode of operation and
   retention time. Only small differences could be observed between the
   three systems involving an aerobic stage. The single aerobic reactor
   also gave rather competitive results with those having an additional
   anaerobic step, whereas the removal in the single anaerobic reactor was
   less than the three other systems. Only at high loading rates did the
   anaerobic-aerobic recycle reactor (AAR) perform better than the other
   systems.
   Constant NPOC/AOX ratio, before and after treatment, showed that the

   The removal by adsorption to biomass and biomass support material was
   less than 1\% for AOX.}},

Abstract = {{Four parallel biological fluidized bed reactor systems-one single
   aerobic, one single anaerobic and two combined anaerobic-aerobic

   By total mass balances it was proven that the individual compounds
   followed were removed almost exclusively by biological degradation. The
   contribution of removal by adsorption on biomass was less than 1\% for
   all the individual chlorophenolic compounds.
   In the three systems involving an aerobic step, 4-chlorophenol,
   2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol were usually quantitatively
   removed. This was observed up to loadings of 1 mmol
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol per m(3) and day.
   At lower loading rates, trichloroguaiacols were also removed
   quantitatively. However, 4,5-dichloroguaiacol was only partly removed,
   whereas 3,5-dichlorosyringol was produced in the reactors from
   unidentified precursors.
   The anaerobic-aerobic recycle reactor did remove individual chlorinated
   phenolics at high loading rates better than the other reactor
   combinations. In the aerobic systems removal rates of organic chlorine
   and carbon correlated well with removal rates estimated from individual
   chlorophenols measurements, despite its low contribution to the total
   values (<<1\%).}},

Abstract = {{Ultraviolet photooxidation is an effective process for the destruction
   of organics in air. In this paper we examine the use of u.v.
   photooxidation to treat the exhaust air from a stripper. VOC
   contaminated water was air stripped using a hollow fiber membrane module
   and the VOC laden air was u.v. photooxidized and recycled to the
   stripper in a closed loop. Batch experiments were conducted under
   different operating conditions. A mathematical model was developed for
   the process and model predictions of process performance compared
   favorably with the experimental results.
   The closed loop air stripping process (CLASP) offers a number of
   potential advantages over conventional air stripping with off-gas
   treatment: no VOCs are released to the atmosphere; the VOCs are oxidized
   to harmless end-products; no adsorber is required; and no adsorbent
   regeneration or disposal costs are incurred.}},

Abstract = {{The use of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) selective enrichment medium for
   the enumeration of salmonellae in pond water from four crocodile farms
   by the most probable number (MPN) method was compared to direct plating
   on Xylose Lysine Desoxycholate agar. Direct plate counts (DPC) were
   consistently higher than MPN estimations (means of DPC 4.6 log(10)
   viable bacteria (v.b.) per 100 ml, as opposed to MPN 2.6 log(10) v.b.
   per 100 ml). It is suggested that the difference may be caused by
   differing viability of Salmonella subspecies or serovars in the RV
   medium, as four laboratory strains of S. enterica subspp. enterica and
   salamae were enumerated equally well by both DPC and MPN determinations,
   whereas the MPN failed to detect two strains of S. enterica subsp.
   diarizona at a concentration level of approximately 2 log(10) v.b. per
   100 ml. It is concluded that the MPN determination method may not be
   sufficient and reliable when applied to samples containing Salmonella
   subspecies and serovars of reptilian origin.}},

Abstract = {{It has been recognized that sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play a
   significant role in corrosion by accelerating the electrochemical
   processes whenever environmental conditions are favourable. In this
   study, the polarization test and the dual-cell test were conducted to
   result in abetter fundamental understanding of corrosion influenced by
   SRB. The polarization test showed that the effects of SRB and anodic or
   cathodic depolarization on corrosion were insignificant when 1.5 mM of
   CaCO3 was added to the solution. The instantaneous corrosion rates of
   steel coupons immersed in the SRB-inoculated solution were 1.5-2.5 times
   greater than those obained in the sterile solution. The polarization
   curves obtained in the SRB-inoculated solution with 0.5 mM sulfate
   concentration indicated that both anodic and cathodic depolarization
   occurred on steel coupons. However, only cathodic depolarization was
   obtained in the SRB-inoculated solution with 0.1 mM sulfate
   concentration, due to low hydrogen sulfide production. From the
   dual-cell test, the electron was transferred from the steel coupon in
   the sterile solution toward the steel coupon immersed in the
   SRB-inoculated solution, probably due to the electron consumption by
   SRB. When CaCO3 was added to the same solution, no reactions occurred on
   the coupons exposed to either the SRB-inoculated solution or the sterile
   solution after 20 h of inoculation.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption equilibria for activated carbon removal of natural organic
   matter (NOM) were obtained for a lake water, a leaf extract humic
   material and a sample from a monitoring well serving a municipal solid
   waste landfill. A multicomponent model incorporating ideal adsorbed
   solution theory (IAST) and a non-adsorbable fraction more accurately
   described equilibrium data for the overall isotherm than a Freundlich
   single component isotherm model, and adequately simulated isotherms for
   variable initial concentration of the water as represented by a lumped
   parameter. A methodology is described for estimating equilibrium
   parameters for multiple hypothetic components that requires fewer
   parameter searches and is thus less computationally demanding than some
   other modeling schemes using IAST. The acquired equilibrium information
   was subsequently used to calibrate a dynamic, fixed-bed model in
   accordance with bench scale column data for the lake water. Rate
   parameters evaluated therein were used to predict breakthrough profiles
   in bench-scale columns of greater bed depth. Generally speaking, dynamic
   modeling which incorporated the multicomponent equilibrium approach
   provided more accurate description and prediction of NOM breakthrough
   profiles than a single component modeling scheme. The multicomponent
   approach was better able to simulate both the slow approach to
   exhaustion in the bed and the effects of changes in influent
   concentration. Although not fully representative of a full-scale system
   operating over a lengthy time period, the exercise gives insight into
   dynamic and modeling phenomena which may accompany seasonal variations
   in natural water quality.}},

Abstract = {{The time-dependent release of lead and zinc from rural aerosol samples
   has been studied in four natural lake waters and various synthetic
   solutions spanning a pH range of 2.99-8.02. Automatic direct measurement
   of the released metals in the experimental vessel was performed at 1 min
   intervals using square wave anodic stripping voltammetry. Substantial
   initial release occurred within minutes. Further release was sometimes
   complete within 15 min but could be still continuing after 60 min
   depending on the nature of the aerosol and the pH of the solution. A
   maximum concentration of metal in solution observed after a few minutes
   for some aerosols was attributed to initial release followed by
   readsorption to the aerosol occurring as a result of a temporary pH
   minimum induced by the dissolution process. High concentrations (1.8 meg
   1(-1)) of calcium in solution stimulated release of lead and zinc,
   consistent with a surface exchange mechanism. The pH dependence of the
   percentage of zinc released was the same for synthetic and natural
   waters. Complete dissolution required more acid conditions than would be
   expected if release was entirely controlled by a simple, reversible
   exchange of ions at the particle surface. The pH dependence of lead
   release is more dependent on solution conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Activated sludge samples from a one-state-system of a municipal sewage
   plant and a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) treating dairy-sewage were
   characterized using 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) targeted
   oligonucleotide probes specific for defined phylogenetic groups of
   bacteria. Cell counts were determined by a combination of in situ
   hybridization with fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotide probes and
   epifluorescence microscopy. Around 80\% of total cells, as determined
   with the DNA specific fluorochrome DAPI, hybridized with a Bacteria
   specific probe. This indicated that the majority of microscopically
   visualized cells were indeed physiologically active. The samples of the
   municipal sewage plant were dominated by proteobacteria belonging to the
   beta-subclass, whereas small cells hybridizing with a
   cytophaga-flavobacterium-specific probe were most abundant in the batch
   reactor. Comparison of in situ microbial community structures and the
   heterotrophic saprophyte flora (analysed with standard cultivation
   techniques) resulted in major discrepancies. The nutrient rich medium
   favoured growth of gamma-subclass proteobacteria (e.g. Acinetobacter
   sp.) which were only a minor constituents (< 10\%) of both sludge
   consortia. Dominating groups like the beta-subclass proteobacteria, the
   cytophaga-flavobacteria cluster and the Gram-positive bacteria with a
   high G + C content of DNA were suppressed. These results suggest that
   the application of in situ hybridization techniques can yield a more
   complete understanding of the microbial populations involved in the
   purification of sewage.}},

Abstract = {{A method is described for the isolation of various phosphate species
   from biological cells of different origin, such as pure and mixed
   cultures and sludge from wastewater treatment plants with enhanced
   biological phosphate removal. Extraction and fractionation of phosphates
   is performed without enzymatic degradation or hydrolysation of inorganic
   polyphosphates (polyP). Analysis of the polyphosphate was carried out by
   HPLC with post-column derivatization, by which the P-species could be
   determined separately. Two different types of phosphate chains could be
   distinguished: short chain polyphosphates in the range of P2 to P30 and
   long chain polyphosphates from P30 to above P75. Due to a lack of
   suitable standards above P75 the upper limit of polyphosphate polymers
   could not be determined. The distribution of low and high molecular
   weight polyP depends on the biocenosis of the sludges. Furthermore, it
   is demonstrated that a mass balance of those phosphate species which
   take part in the various processes of a biological phosphate removal is
   possible.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption of microcystin-LR by eight different powdered activated
   carbons (PACs) was investigated and found to vary markedly between
   carbons. Wood-based carbons were clearly the most effective
   microcystin-1R adsorbents followed by coal-based PACs. Coconut and peat
   moss-based carbons were the poorest microcystin-LR adsorbents.
   The extent of adsorption for each PAC was related to the volume of
   mesopores (diameters between 2.0 and 50 nm) which was dependent on the
   starting material. Surface characteristics, however, were not related to
   the starting material.
   Competitive adsorption with natural organics in River Murray water
   significantly reduced the initial rate of microcystin-1R adsorption.
   There was also a considerable reduction in the maximum level of
   microcystin-LR adsorption, the extent of which was dependent on the type
   of carbon.}},

Abstract = {{A two-stage anaerobic bioflocculation process (ABP) successfully
   flocculated a high grease (> 15 g/1) wool scouring effluent (WSE).
   During 110 days of continuous operation, a two-stage laboratory process
   removed between 70 and 90\% grease and 60-86\% COD at a combined
   hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 4-10 days. Grease removal was more
   difficult with low grease (< 10 g/1) WSE. At a HRT of 3 days a
   single-stage ABP removed 40 and 44\% grease at 20 and 37 degrees C,
   respectively.
   Methane production and volatile fatty acids consumption were negligible.
   Most of the grease was removed by flocculation as a result of anaerobic
   bacterial activity. The supernatant was successfully treated by an
   aerobic activated sludge process reducing grease concentration from
   about 1.5 to less than 0.1 g/1 in the final effluent at an HRT of 3
   days.}},

Abstract = {{The emulsified grease in wool scouring effluent (WSE) was demonstrably
   removed by bioflocculation under anaerobic conditions. The addition of
   anaerobic bacteria from biogas digestion to WSE resulted in grease
   reduction of 60-80\% from the supernatant. Since no significant net
   grease (supernatant plus sludge) reduction was observed in this system,
   the grease emulsion from the liquid phase is simply settled by gravity
   into the sludge phase. However, sterilized sludge did not cause this
   effect, indicating that bacterial metabolic activity was responsible for
   the bioflocculation. It was also found that such microbes can
   successfully survive and multiply in WSE, as a result, the development
   of a continuous process is possible.
   The process required a short gentle mixing period of approx. 15 min to
   enable the sludge to completely contact with WSE, and a longer settling
   period of 2-4 days to provide an appropriate time for the microbes to
   destabilize wool grease emulsion and settle to the sludge phase.}},

Abstract = {{Solubility of inorganic phosphorus (P) in aquatic systems is regulated
   by physico-chemical characteristics of the water column. Laboratory
   studies were conducted to determine the influence of pH and calcium (Ca)
   on inorganic P precipitation and solubility relationships in the water
   column. Water samples from selected streams and canals in south Florida
   were incubated at 25 degrees C in 2.8 L. continuously-stirred reactors
   under different PCO2, levels. Precipitation of soluble P was influenced
   by the initial Ca concentration of the water. Water samples from a
   drainage canal of the Everglades agricultural area (EAA) (115 mg Ca
   1(-1)) showed the highest P precipitation rate and Otter Creek water (20
   mg Ca 1(-1)) the lowest. Precipitation of inorganic P increased at Ca
   concentrations above 100 mg 1(-1) and at pH > 9.0. Solubility of
   inorganic P in the EAA water decreased above pH 8.5. At pH 9.0 more than
   60\% of the soluble P at all Ca levels was precipitated. In contrast, P
   solubility at low Ca levels (20 and 50 mg Ca 1(-1)) was not affected at
   pH < 9.0. The decrease in P solubility as pH and Ca levels were
   increased suggests that calcium phosphate mineral formation occurred in
   the stream and canal water.
   Calcium phosphate formed in Otter Creek and Dry Lake waters rapidly
   dissolved as the pH decreased. Most of the soluble P in the Otter Creek
   (> 90\%) and Dry Lake (> 75\%) waters came back into solution; however,
   about 50\% of the soluble P from the EAA canal water remained
   precipitated. Ion activity product calculations indicated that Otter
   Creek and Dry Lake waters were at equilibrium with octacalcium
   phosphate. In contrast, the EAA canal water was supersaturated with
   respect to beta tricalcium phosphate or with a similar mineral such as
   whitlockite. High Mg concentrations in the EAA water were apparently
   responsible for a different P behavior than for the Dry Lake and Otter
   Creek waters.}},

Abstract = {{Potable water studies have suggested that the presence of coliforms in
   contaminated potable water supplies was also associated with hydrogen
   sulphide producing organisms. Based on these observations, a paper strip
   testing method was used and modified to screen for bacteriological
   contamination of potable waters. The simplicity and low cost of the H2S
   paper strip technique, if applicable to tropical and subtropical potable
   waters, would provide countries with an affordable, locally produced
   water quality monitoring test. To evaluate the feasibility of this test,
   622 drinking water samples, disinfected and non-disinfected, were
   collected from three districts in Chile and tested by the H2S paper
   strip method and total coliform MPN method and for coliphages. Results
   from this study indicated that (1) in treated and untreated drinking
   waters tested by the H2S paper strip and total coliform MPN test, the
   H2S test produced slightly more (10\%) positive findings and (2) when
   the positive H2S paper strip samples were tested for coliforms, the
   number of H2S positive samples containing coliforms was similar to the
   number of samples testing positive by the total coliform MPN.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments investigated the feasibility of a novel granular
   activated carbon (GAC) regeneration technique: electrochemical
   regeneration. GAC was loaded with phenol, via batch adsorption tests,
   then electrochemically regenerated and finally reloaded with phenol.
   Regeneration was conducted in a batch reactor filled with a 1\% NaCl
   solution as the electrolyte. As limited experiments showed that cathodic
   regeneration was 5-10\% more efficient than anodic regeneration, the
   investigation concentrated on the former. Although anodic regeneration
   was more efficient in destroying phenol residuals from the electrolyte,
   cathodic regeneration could also eliminate these residuals by using
   longer regeneration times and/or higher currents. Increasing the
   regeneration current to 100 mA for 5 hours can increase the regeneration
   efficiency (RE) to a maximum of 95\%. Lower currents applied for longer
   regeneration times can yield similar results. REs were also
   significantly affected by the electrolyte type, the electrolyte
   concentration, and the GAC particle size, but not by the phenol
   loadings. Multiple regenerations only reduce the REs an additional 2\%
   per cycle. Given the high regeneration efficiencies and no apparent
   carbon losses, electrochemical regeneration of GAC at a laboratory-scale
   is a feasible alternative to thermal regeneration and merits further
   investigation.}},

   isoquinoline, p-cresol, 4-chlorophenol, 2,4,5-chlorophe nol, diethyl

   biodegrade the chlorophenolic compounds during the experimental period.
   A dynamic model, developed to predict the fate of toxics during primary

Abstract = {{Ozonation of activated sludge treated carbonization wastewater after pH
   alteration (PH 4 and 12), including removal of the coagulated matter
   formed by pH alteration, and at an unaltered pH of 7.5, were compared.
   Batch ozonation at the unaltered pH resulted in a significant higher
   residual COD (rCOD) reduction efficiency. At the unaltered pH 0.308 g
   rCOD/g O-3 were removed while at altered pHs of 4 and 12 reduction
   efficiencies of 0.169 and 0.197 g rCOD/g O-3 were obtained during 40 min
   ozonation with 0.02 g O-3/1 min applied. The soluble fraction of
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was generally reduced below 0.02
   mu g/1. PAHs adsorbed onto the suspended solids were reduced below 0.5
   mu g/1. Continuous ozonation at the unaltered pH at residence times of
   15 and 30 min resulted in average rCOD reduction efficiencies of about
   0.655 g rCOD/g O-3. Also good CNS- and color reduction were obtained at
   both residence times tested. Yet, ozonation resulted in acute and short
   term inhibition of the oxygen uptake rate of unadapted sludge.
   Additional detoxification by a trickling filter was capable of
   eliminating the ozone induced toxicity. It was also shown that
   biological processes had a major part in this detoxification process. It
   is concluded that for carbonization wastewater, purification by
   activated sludge followed by ozonation allows a high effluent quality to
   be achieved but precautions for the receiving ecosystems are needed due
   to ozone induced toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{Flocculation has been studied extensively within marine science and
   sanitary engineering and the controlling processes are generally well
   known. Less research, however, has focused on flocculation within the
   freshwater river environment. Consequently the occurrence, importance
   and controlling mechanisms are poorly understood. We examine the
   suspended sediment characteristics of six rivers in southeastern Canada
   in order to determine the nature and significance of flocculation in
   fine-grained suspended sediment transport and the factors that may
   influence it. While flocs may not always comprise the majority of
   particles in transport, they always represent more than 90\% of the
   total volume of sediment transported. Independent variables that may
   influence flocculation, such as temperature, pH, major ions, dissolved
   and particulate organic carbon, suspended solids concentration and
   bacteria were measured in conjunction with floc size for one of the
   rivers. Particulate organic carbon concentration, suspended solids
   concentration and attached bacteria may be important controlling factors
   of riverine flocculation.}},

Abstract = {{Coliphages are regarded as possible indicators of enteric viruses in
   drinking water and waters used for recreational purposes. They can be
   detected in water by a rapid, simple and inexpensive method, which does
   not require special equipment or specially skilled personnel. In spite
   of extensive studies of coliphages any agreement about a standard method
   has not yet been reached. One of the questions that has delayed the
   decision is the choice of a good host strain.
   In the present study, the ability of more than 40 Escherichia coli
   strains to detect phages in effluents of several wastewater treatment
   plants in Finland was tested. The 12 most sensitive strains were
   selected for a study of sensitivity to pure cultures of coliphages
   isolated from Finnish and Nicaraguan wastewaters. The sensitivity of the
   host strains was found to be similar to phages isolated from both
   countries. Two strains were sensitive to 20 of the 25 somatic coliphages
   tested. Three strains had almost identical patterns of sensitivity to
   male-specific RNA-phages, two of the strain were sensitive to all of the
   13 and one strain to 12 phages tested.
   According to the results the same host strains can be used in countries
   where the climate is very different.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption and aerobic biodegradation of 1-NH2 naphthalene (I),
   2-NH2-naphthalene-(II), 1-NH2-2-CH3-naphthalene (III), 1-NO2 naphthalene
   (IV), 2-NO2 naphthalene (V) and 1-NO2-2-CH3-naphthalene (VI) were
   investigated in flooded soil under different pH conditions. Compounds
   (I-VI) showed curvilinear adsorption patterns. The observed enhancement
   in the adsorption of the ionizable aminonaphthalenes (I-III) under
   acidic conditions suggests that, in addition to the hydrophobic
   interactions and hydrogen bonding, cation exchange of the protonated
   compounds is an important adsorption mechanism. The adsorption of the
   nonionizable nitronaphthalenes (IV and VI) showed no variation with pH
   and their partition coefficients correlated well with solubility
   suggesting the predominance of hydrophobic interactions. The aerobic
   mineralization pattern of compounds I-VI were biphasic giving an initial
   fast phase followed by a slow phase controlled by the substrate
   bioavailability. The initial mineralization rates of the nitro-compounds
   IV and V were higher than those of the corresponding amines I and II.
   Methyl substitution at the ortho-position, i.e. compounds (III) and
   (VI), increased Freundlich adsorption constant, (K-F), despite its
   steric effect on H-bonding, and interestingly reduced the initial and
   second phase mineralization rates. All compounds I-VI showed
   recalcitrance under anoxic denitrifying, sulfate reducing and
   methanogenic conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Mineralization of 1-aminonaphthalene, 2-aminonaphthalene and
   1-amino-2-methyl-naphthalene under aerobic conditions in hooded soil was
   found to proceed with a biphasic pattern, an initial fast phase followed
   by a slower second one. Also the sorption isotherms of these substrates
   were found to be hyperbolic and were best described by the Langmuir
   model. When initial mineralization rates were expressed in terms of
   initial aqueous-phase concentrations, they gave rise to simple
   hyperbolic kinetics that obeyed Michaelis-Menten model for
   enzyme-catalysed reactions. These initial mineralization rates were
   found to be directly proportional to the substrate aqueous concentration
   reaching their maxima at about 100 mu g g(-1) (aminonaphthalene/soil
   slurry). Whereas the second phase mineralization rates were found to be
   first order with respect to the adsorbed fraction of the substrate and
   showed no sign of saturation, thus indicating that biodegradation is
   controlled by the rate of desorption.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of 31 secondary-treated pulp and paper mill effluents from
   eight different mills to induce mixed function oxidase (MFO) activity,
   in the liver of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), was investigated by
   short-term (4-day) laboratory exposures to 10\% effluent concentration.
   Two of six thermomechanical pulp (TMP) mill effluents investigated
   caused increased EROD activity while there was no increase caused by the
   two chemi-thermomechanical pulp (CTMP) mill effluents tested. In
   contrast, with one exception, EROD activity was significantly induced as
   a result of exposure to bleached as well as unbleached kraft mill
   effluents. The replacement of chlorine in the bleaching of kraft pulp by
   chlorine dioxide or non-chlorine containing compounds (such as peroxide)
   did not eliminate the final mill effluent's ability to induce EROD
   activity. Rather, the kraft cooking process used to convert wood into
   pulp may itself be a source of MFO-inducing substances.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of volatile fatty acid (VFA) production in thermophilic
   aerobic digestion (TAD) of primary sludge was investigated under 3
   aeration conditions. The HRT and SRT of the pilot scale 2 stage TAD
   process was 6 d. The average total solids in the primary feed sludge was
   1.7\%. A 294 degrees C-day operation resulted in an average total solids
   destruction of 29\%. The microaerobic condition (air flow rate of only
   0.126 V/V/h) gave the highest VFA concentration at 950 mg/l. The
   transition condition (air flow rate of 0.28 V/V/h) produced considerably
   less VFA at 80 mg/l. The aerobic condition (air Bow rate of 0.6 V/V/h)
   produced negligible amounts of VFA. Acetate constituted 81\% out of the
   total VFA concentration. Propionate constituted the second largest
   fraction at 11\%. VFA production was concluded to be a function of
   aeration. Decreasing or increasing the aeration rate resulted in a
   simultaneous proportionate change in VFA production.}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia oxidizers were enumerated in 34 activated sludges, including
   sludges which were from sewage treatment plants (S-sludge), nightsoil
   treatment plants (N-sludge) and activated sludges cultivated with
   organic (O-sludge) or inorganic (I-sludge) artificial wastewaters in the
   laboratory. Two media were used for enumeration, one containing 0.76 mM
   (AL medium) and the other 37.9 mM (AH medium) of (NH4)(2)SO4. The MPN
   estimated with AL medium were higher than those with AH medium in
   S-sludges, N-sludges and O-sludges, while both media gave almost the
   same MPN for I-sludges. Ten ammonia oxidizers, all identified as
   Nitrosomonas spp, were isolated from sludge samples. Isolates obtained
   as predominants in S- and O-sludges were sensitive to (NH4)(2)SO4; they
   grew in medium containing 0.71 mM of (NH4)(2)SO4 but not in medium
   containing 35.7 mM of (NH4)(2)SO4. On the other hand, those obtained as
   predominants in an I-sludge, as well as ATCC strains grew in both media.
   The Monod equation described the relationship between (NH4)(2)SO4
   concentration and nitrite production rates for (NH4)(2)SO4-insensitive
   strains but not for sensitive strains, which exhibited a relationship
   closer to the Haldane equation describing substrate inhibition kinetics.
   Among isolates obtained from S-sludge sample, K-m and V-max values of an
   (NH4)(2)SO4-sensitive strain were much lower than those of an
   insensitive strain. Similarly, among laboratory sludge isolates, K-m and
   V-max values of an (NH4)(2)SO4-sensitive strain from an O-sludge were
   lower than those of an insensitive strain from an I-sludge. These
   results suggest that (NH4)(2)SO4-sensitive strains had a growth
   advantage in lower (NH4)(2)SO4 concentrations, while insensitive strains
   had an advantage in higher (NH4)(2)SO4 concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption and removal of pentachlorophenol (PCP) by 12 species of
   white rot fungi is a function of species and culture conditions. In
   general, PCP adsorption to mycelia was very low, ranging from 0.01 to
   0.05 g PCP g mycelium(-1) (dry wt basis) at 40 mg PCP l(-1), with no
   apparent correlation between species. After long pre-incubation periods
   (8-20 d), all species of fungi reduced PCP by > 50\% within 12 days of
   PCP addition. Several species of fungi, including Phanerochaete
   chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor, and all four Ganoderma sp. removed >
   50\% of the PCP within 24 h, although the largest overall reduction of
   PCP (96\%) was achieved by Inonotus rickii. PCP removal in 250 ml flasks
   by shallow (10 ml) cultures was greater than removal by deep (50 ml)
   cultures indicating that the ratio of surface area to volume of liquid
   media is an important factor in the extent of PCP removal by white rot
   fungi.}},

Abstract = {{Photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) was applied for the
   characterization (concentration and size distribution) of colloidal
   matter in a deep groundwater. The measurements were performed on-line
   and in situ at the Aspo underground Hard Rock Laboratory, Oskarshamn,
   Sweden, The colloidal concentration in the rather saline groundwater was
   not above 0.1 mg/l and probably below 0.03 mg/l, according to the field
   measurements and with calibrations of the PCS-instrument with
   well-defined reference colloids of alpha-Fe2O3, gamma-Al(OH)(3) and
   SiO2.
   The results clearly demonstrated that the stability and concentration of
   a colloidal-size suspended phase in an anoxic groundwater with high
   Fe(II) content, like the one in Aspo (0.3 mg/l), is sensitive to
   exposure to atmospheric conditions during the handling of the sample.
   Diffusion of air into the closed measuring cuvette was enough to alter
   the colloidal content significantly within 6 h. A particle fraction with
   a size distribution range of 170-700 nm was formed within 45 min when
   air was allowed to diffuse into the aqueous phase from the air-filled
   upper part of the cuvette. The corresponding time to generate a
   significant colloidal precipitate was less than 1 min (size distribution
   range 100-600 nm) when a stream of air (1.5 mi) was bubbled through the
   water samples. The precipitating colloidal phase was a mixture of ferric
   hydroxide and calcium carbonate in all three cases.}},

Abstract = {{The partition coefficients and dissociation constants (as pK(a)) of
   chlorophenols were determined, using n-heptane and n-octane as
   non-hydrogen bonding solvents, and I-octanol and n-heptane containing
   lecithin as hydrogen bonding solvents.
   The coefficients of chlorophenols in n-heptane-water were almost the
   same values as those in n-octane-water. A good correlation of r = 0.996
   was observed between the coefficient in I-octanol-water and that in
   n-heptane containing lecithin-water. However, the correlation between
   the coefficient in n-octane-water and that in I-octanol-water was a
   little low (r = 0.885) compared with the above value, and that between
   n-heptane-water and n-heptane containing lecithin-water was also a
   little low (r = 0.890). The partition coefficients of chlorophenols in
   the solvent-water systems increased with increasing number of chlorine
   atoms.
   In chlorophenols having the same number of chlorine atoms, their
   partition coefficients in hydrogen bonding solvent-water decreased in
   the order of non-, mono- and di-orthochlorophenols, whereas the
   coefficients in non-hydrogen bonding solvent-water increased in the
   above order. This fact must be attributed to the formation of
   intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the chlorine atom substituted at
   the ortho-position and the OH group in the chlorophenols.
   The pK(a) values of chlorophenols decreased with increasing number of
   chlorine atoms, and also with the closing of the chlorine atom position
   to the OH group in chlorophenols having the same number of chlorine
   atoms.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and fate of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been
   studied in a pilot wastewater treatment facility, utilizing conventional
   unit treatment processes to treat combined industrial and domestic
   wastewaters. Samples of influent, effluent and sludges were obtained
   from three configurations of the pilot plant and PCB concentrations were
   determined by gas liquid chromatography with electron capture detection
   (ECD). An evaluation of the performances of biofiltration and activated
   sludge units operating in series and in isolation was conducted.
   Influent PCB concentrations ranged from <5 to 350 mu g l(-1). Commercial
   Aroclor formulations were detected in treated wastewaters and sludges.
   Estimated influent masses varied between 0.4 and 1.3 g total PCB d(-1)
   at a flow rate of 22 m(3) d(-1). Primary sedimentation removed approx.
   45\% of the PCB load. Concentrations in primary sludges ranged from 8.7
   to 659.3 mg kg(-1). A simplified mass balance across primary
   sedimentation indicated potential sources of sampling and analytical
   error which were exacerbated by the complex chemical nature of the
   influent. PCB removal across combined secondary biofiltration achieved a
   mean level of 99\%. Biofiltration atone, attained a removal efficiency
   of 90\% and activated sludge treatment eliminated 96\%. Typical
   concentrations in activated sludge ranged from 1.6 to 5.4 mg kg(-1) dry
   weight. Final effluent loadings approximated to 0.01 g total PCB d(-1).
   An order of magnitude reduction was recorded across the pilot plant in
   all combinations with residual PCB discharge being associated with fine,
   non-settleable particulates.}},

Abstract = {{Five nitrophenols and two synthetic dyes were ozonated to evaluate the
   biodegradability of reaction products from water quality parameters, and
   the relationship between the biodegradability and the behavior of the
   reaction products and of the nitrogen forms was then discussed.
   Biodegradability represented in terms of BOD5/TOC was observed to reach
   a maximum, indicating that there was an optimum condition. It was
   confirmed, from the comparison of the biodegradability of the target
   compounds with that of phenol, that the variation of biodegradability
   was deeply associated with the behavior of the nitrogen forms. The
   amount of ozone consumed required to lead to the maximum BOD5/TOC value
   varied with the target compounds, lying between 2.3 and 3.8 mg per mg of
   initial TOC for nitrophenols, and between 1.3 and 1.7 mg for synthetic
   dyes. From the behavior of nitrogen, it could be assumed that nitrogen
   in the azo group would be partly released from solution as nitrogen gas,
   and that nitrogen in the nitro group would remain in solution after
   ozonation as nitrate ion and so on.}},

   AN AERATION TANK BY USING RESPIROMETRY AND ESTIMATION}},

Abstract = {{For good control of the activated sludge process, accurate measurement
   of the short-term biochemical oxygen demand (BODst) in the aeration tank
   (S-a) and the actual respiration rate of the activated sludge (r(act))
   is required. A previously described measurement technique for these
   variables requires the measurement of three types of respiration rate of
   which one rate, the actual respiration rate, involves continuous
   addition of influent sample to a respiration chamber. The technique is
   only applicable to a plant with one single aeration tank or to the first
   compartment of a plug flow reactor.
   In this paper, a method is proposed for the estimation of S-a and r(act)
   in a completely mixed aeration tank, no matter whether this is a single
   reactor or a compartment of a plug Bow reactor. In contrast to the other
   technique, this method does not involve addition of influent sample to
   the respiration chamber. Instead, the transient respiration rate is
   measured during two modes of operation which are alternately executed.
   In one mode, sludge from the aeration tank hows through the respiration
   chamber, whereas in the other mode, sludge having the endogenous rate is
   directed through the chamber. The S-a is obtained by integrating the
   mass balance equations for each cycle of two different modes. The
   measured respiration rate and the calculated BODst during each cycle of
   two modes are used to find the kinetic relationship in order to
   calculate r(act).
   The proposed method has been verified using simulated and experimental
   data. The estimated S-a and r(act) from experimental data are in
   agreement with the diurnal variation typical for the wastewater used.
   The pattern of r(act) is in agreement with the one obtained by the
   previously described method. There is, however, a significant difference
   between the average values of the two methods. A possible explanation
   for this bias is given. Compared to the previously described method, the
   proposed method is simpler to use in practice.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of solute transport in the Cauvery river was studied during a
   5 year period (1985-1989). On the basis of our analytical results, the
   discharge weighted average chemical composition of the Cauvery river has
   been computed and compared with major rivers of India and the world. The
   chemical composition of Cauvery river water is dominated by Na and HCO3.
   The river water chemistry strongly reflects the dominance of continental
   weathering and impact by atmospheric precipitation. The river water
   composition is increasingly dominated by Na and Cl in the downstream
   region of the river, indicating the influence of airborne salts with
   oceanic affinities. The observed chemical data of the Cauvery river
   water was used to predict the mineral assemblages in the carbonate and
   alumine-silicate system and compared with observed mineralogical
   composition of suspended sediments. Over 90\% of the material
   transported in the Cauvery river is transported in dissolved form. The
   total dissolved material transported from the Cauvery to the Bay of
   Bengal accounts for 14\% of the annual flux of dissolved load from
   Indian rivers to the neighboring seas.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of Wet Air Oxidation of morpholine and diethanolamine (DEA)
   in aqueous solutions, were studied. The rates of destruction were
   measured with respect to reduction in substrate concentration and with
   respect to reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). The studies were
   performed in the temperature range of 160-240 degrees C and oxygen
   partial pressure was in the range of 0.34-1.36 MPa. The order with
   respect to COD and substrate concentration (morpholine and
   diethanolamine) was found to be one. Order with respect to oxygen
   concentration ranged from 0.3 to 0.9. The energy of activation was found
   to be in the range of 18.5-27.24 kcal/gmol. Monoethanolamine was found
   to be one of the intermediates formed during oxidation of morpholine and
   DEA. The mixtures of diethanolamine and morpholine were found to oxidize
   faster than that expected from the individual rate of oxidation.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption on activated carbon is an attractive method of removal of
   organic compounds as micropollutants from natural waters and
   wastewaters. The physico-chemical nature of the surface of carbon is an
   important factor in the adsorption process and should be considered in
   selection or preparation of activated carbon for specific adsorption.
   The purpose of the present study is to quantify the effect of PAC, heat
   treated PAC(T), acid treated PAC (OC) of powder activated carbon (PAC <
   50 mu m; Chemviron F400) and to compare the removal of organic compounds
   (humic acids, phenol, phtalic acid, salicylic acid, benzoic acid,
   atrazine, sodium dodecyl sulphate). Mechanism of the adsorption will be
   discussed on the basis of the results: adsorption capacities zeta
   potential of particles and physical characteristics of PAC.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of porous and non-porous media in two mesophilic
   anaerobic upflow filters treating a wastewater from a milk bottling
   factory was investigated. The results indicated that at higher OLRs the
   porous media had a much better performance. The reactor with non-porous
   packing showed instability above an OLR of 4 kg COD/m3.d whereas the
   reactor with the porous packing was still stable at OLRs of up to 21 kg
   COD/m(3).d. The behaviour of the media and biomass wash-out were
   observed at high upflow velocities (UV) and results demonstrated that
   porous media was not as susceptible to shear stresses as non-porous
   media. At the end of the investigation, attachment studies were carried
   out and the results showed a heavy biomass attachment in the porous
   media, whereas mainly unattached biomass was retained in the voids of
   the non-porous media.}},

Abstract = {{About 6 x 10(7) m(3) (20\%) of the 3 x 10(8) m(3) of sewage water in
   Israel is recharged into the coastal groundwater aquifer in the Tel-Aviv
   region after an activated sludge treatment process. A subsequent pumping
   out of these effluents via recovery wells supplies reclaimed water,
   mainly for unrestricted irrigation, to the southern part of Israel, as
   part of the total 12 x 10(8) m(3)/year of water used in the country for
   irrigation.
   Although the soil/aquifer treatment (SAT) was shown to be efficient for
   the removal of BOD, COD, TOC and anionic surfactants (70-90\%), an
   increase in the organic parameters of the reclaimed water compared with
   those of previous years, was observed.
   The effectiveness of non-ionic surfactants' removal via existing primary
   and secondary wastewater treatment plants and that of the combined
   activated sludge/soil aquifer treatment was shown to be 69-81 and 97\%
   (96/92.5\% in terms of CTAS), respectively. The concentrations of 22-25
   ppb of `'hard'' non-ionic surfactants still found in the reused water
   constitute an issue of concern.}},

Abstract = {{The aquatic plants Salvinia and Spirodela were used for the removal of
   chromium and nickel in their synthetic solutions of 1.0-8.0 ppm in the
   months of August-November 1990 and April-July 1991. The rate of
   percentage removal of these metal ions was observed to be 56-96 and
   18-72\% after the first 2 and 14 days of contact time by both aquatic
   plants for a single group solution of metal ions, respectively, but in
   the case of the mixed group solution, the removal rate was 35-83 and
   10-53\%, respectively. The results show that the removal rate decreases
   with increasing contact time of the aquatic plants. The metal ion
   concentrations in both aquatic plants after 14 days of contact with feed
   solutions were analysed in all sets of the experiment and it was
   observed that the concentration of both the metal ions in the aquatic
   plants and the biomass growth of the aquatic plants were Lower in mixed
   group solutions than in single group solutions. In the nickel-enriched
   solution the biomass growth of Salvinia was higher than Spirodela in
   both seasons. But, in the case of the chromium solution, the growth was
   higher for Salvinia in the months of August-November 1990 and in
   April-July 1991 the growth of both aquatic plants was nearly equal. The
   metal concentration factor was also calculated to evaluate the potential
   of accumulating metals for both aquatic plants.}},

Abstract = {{A differential equation representing Monod-type substrate utilization in
   dispersed plug flow mediums is solved by convergent series techniques.
   The system has two particular solutions each inherently related with the
   analytical expression of ideal plug Bow reactors for Monod-type
   substrate removal and with those of dispersed plug flow reactors for
   substrates undergoing first order degradation. The particular solutions
   satisfy the differential equation with a high precision. The fraction of
   the effluent substrate concentration, calculated by imposing Wehner and
   Wilhelm-type boundary conditions on the particular solutions, is
   independent from influent substrate concentration and it is solely a
   function of the Peclet number characterizing longitudinal dispersion,
   and the reaction rate KB. Results are illustrated in tabular and
   graphical forms. Application to practice is illustrated by design
   examples. The findings in this paper may be useful for engineers in
   design considerations based upon Monod-type substrate removal.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of an appropriate support particle
   size and its distribution in a fluidized bed bioreactor used for the
   denitrification of potable water. The derivation of the settling
   velocity ratio of particles with and without biomass has been presented
   and also an estimate for the change in drag coefficient due to the
   quality of the biomass has been attempted. The relations of the velocity
   ratio to the particle diameter ratio ale shown graphically, with
   particular regard to the probable change in the drag coefficient. The
   settling velocities of support particles of two different diameters have
   been calculated both with and without the biofilm and the example
   displays the necessity of a monodisperse bed construction in order to
   secure the correct continuous function of the bioreactor. In cases where
   the diameters differ substantially, the larger particles will always
   stay below the smaller ones, and will not be carried up nor separated
   from the overgrown biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the transformation processes of carbon, nitrogen
   and phosphorus in a wastewater stabilization pond system visually and
   quantitatively, material transformation graphics of these three elements
   are produced from the ecological model of a pond system. The model was
   established by the authors based on their own experimental experiences.
   The results of the analyses of these graphics indicate that the removal
   rates of carbon are closely related to its transformation quantities;
   the mechanisms of the wastewater stabilization pond and its difference
   from the traditional biological treatment system are interpreted further
   in this study. The study shows that the major characteristics of a pond
   system beyond the traditional biological treatment system are that the
   pond system possesses a longer food chain which makes the system more
   stable and maintains a perfect relationship between bacteria and algae
   which makes good oxygen and nutrient cycling. Removal of nitrogen and
   phosphorus mainly depends on the nutrient assimilation of bacteria and
   algae, since microbial biomass is limited in the pond system, very high
   removal rates of nitrogen and phosphorus should not be expected using a
   stabilization pond.}},

Abstract = {{The survival of genetically engineered microorganisms (GEMs) harboring

   coli C600 (pBH500) and Pseudomonas putida BH(pBH500) were inoculated
   into activated sludge and cultivated in the fill and draw (FD) and
   continuous how (CF) systems under different conditions. In both systems,
   the populations of introduced GEMs declined rapidly during the initial
   period (5-10 days for the FD system and 5-15 days for the CF system),
   after which they remained relatively stable. In the FD system, the
   larger the inoculum size, the higher the population level at which the
   GEMs remained stable. However, in the CF system, repeated inoculation
   did not improve the survival of P. putida BH(pBH500). The sludge
   retention time (SRT) affected the survival of GEMs considerably in both
   systems; as the SRT of the system was decreased, the survival
   populations of GEMs increased. The presence of phenol, which can support
   the growth of P. putida BH(pBH500), did not influence its survival.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of dissolved oxygen (DO) on the sorption of natural and
   model humic substances by granular activated carbon (GAC) were
   investigated. Among five substances tested, the sorptions of only two,
   polymaleic acid (PMA) and peat humic acid, were affected by the presence
   of DO. The uptake of the target compound o-cresol on virgin GAC and on
   GAC preloaded with PMA under oxic and anoxic conditions was also
   examined. The oxic and anoxic preloading conditions had similar effects
   on subsequent o-cresol reactions under both oxic and anoxic sorption
   conditions. A reduction of approximately 20\% in o-cresol uptake
   observed under anoxic conditions by GAC preloaded under each condition
   is attributed to a decrease in the adsorption capacity of the GAC by
   preloading. In the presence of oxygen, however, an observed reduction of
   about 45\% in o-cresol uptake by preloaded GAC appears to result from a
   combination of decreased adsorption and inhibited o-cresol
   polymerization.}},

Abstract = {{A novel mathematical model for nitrifying trickling filters has been
   developed. The model is based on material balances on the biofilm and
   the bulk liquid. The model predicts the profiles of nutrients as a
   function of the operating parameters (volumetric flow rate and feed
   ammonia concentration). Based on the assumption that the biofilm
   consists of an active and an inactive part, and that biofilm detachment
   occurs when the viable bacteria in the inactive biofilm drop below a
   critical fraction, the model also predicts the biofilm thickness as a
   function of filter depth. In order to verify the validity of the model,
   experiments using a pilot-scale nitrifying trickling filter were
   performed. In all cases the comparison between the model predictions and
   the experimental data is satisfactory. In particular, the model was
   found to predict the pilot performance for ammonia concentrations
   encountered in potable water quite well. The model is ideal for the
   design of nitrifying trickling filters due to the simplicity of its
   recursive equations.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption on a mercury/water interface of a sample of humic acids
   from an Irish peat has been analyzed by a.c. voltammetry, using a
   hanging mercury drop electrode in an unstirred and/or stirred medium, at
   different pH values (pH = 2.5, 5 and 8) and two potential values (E =
   -0.5 and -0.9V), in order to have a better insight into the kinetics and
   equilibrium adsorption which may drastically affect the voltammetric
   signal in trace metal speciation of natural waters.
   The results at pH 2.5 present a slower kinetic of adsorption but a
   higher coverage degree at the equilibrium when compared with pH 5 and/or
   8 due to the charge of the molecules. At -0.5 V, close to the potential
   of zero charge, the kinetics of adsorption is discussed in terms of a
   diffusion mechanism, but at -0.9 V the experimental curves clearly show
   that the global adsorption process cannot be explained by a pure
   diffusion mechanism based on Frumkin isotherm.}},

Abstract = {{Toxic cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) are becoming recognized as a
   greater water quality problem as blooms become more common in waters
   affected by increasing nutrient levels, and knowledge of the properties
   of the toxin increases. Of particular importance are the hepatotoxic
   cyclic peptides produced by certain strains of Microcystis species and
   by Nodularia spumigena. The effects of chlorine and chloramine on these
   hepatotoxins in both freeze-dried and intact material were investigated.
   The destruction of the toxins was monitored using HPLC analysis. In a
   number of cases mouse bioassays were used for confirmation of the
   destruction of the toxins and to ensure that toxic by-products, not
   detectable by HPLC, were not formed. Contrary to evidence reported in
   the literature, chlorine was effective in destroying toxins, as long as
   sufficient chlorine was used. Toxins were destroyed under conditions
   such that a chlorine residual of at least 0.5 mg/l was present after 30
   min contact time. The destruction of toxins was pH dependent;
   chlorinating agents such as calcium and sodium hypochlorite were not as
   effective at high dose rates due to elevation of pH, Chloramination had
   little effect on toxins. Although the degradation mechanisms have yet to
   be established, the results show that chlorination may be an effective
   and practical method for the removal of cyanobacterial peptide toxins
   from drinking water.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of faecal and total coliforms is studied in a reservoir
   where wastewater is stored during the rainy winter to be used for
   irrigation during the dry summer. The operational regime of the
   reservoir is irregular, changing between non-steady-state flow and
   batch. The ranges of the reservoir's key parameters are: inflow faecal
   coliforms, 10(6)-10(7)/100cm(3); water level, 2.3-5.5 m; water
   temperature, 10-30 degrees C; pH, 6.9-8.6; mean hydraulic residence
   time, 50-180 days; surface organic loading, 0-340 kg COD/ha/day.
   Coliform removal is high in the epilimnion where high pH values occur
   due to algal activity, and low in the hypolimnion where pH values are
   much lower. When the reservoir is operated as a flow reactor, coliform
   removal is determined mainly by the percentage of fresh effluents within
   the reservoir (PFE) and not by the mean residence time of the effluents
   (MRT). The coliform removal percentage is one to two orders of magnitude
   when the reservoir is operated as a flow reactor, but it can reach more
   than five orders of magnitude when operated as a batch reactor. A proper
   combination of flow operation during winter and batch operation during
   summer can assure a coliform removal of at least five orders of
   magnitude during the whole irrigation season. Coliform removal can also
   be improved by vertical mixing of the water column, the use of a
   horizontal diffuser device in the outlet, and the design of elongated
   reservoirs.}},

Abstract = {{The succession of the microbial population depending on mean cellular

   studied.
   Three facilities were studied for a 1 year period. Microorganisms
   (protozoa, small metazoa and filamentous microorganisms) were counted
   using an optical microscope, specifically determining ciliated protozoa.
   A mathematical model is proposed for MCRT and the comparison between the
   experimental results and those predicted by the proposed model reveals
   that there is a difference between: (1) the succession of protozoa
   during the start up of a plant and (2) the succession due to variations
   in MCRT variation in the normal functioning of the plant. Although
   variations in protozoan population depend on mean cellular retention
   time in the short term (less than a week) they also depend on the
   protozoan species present. In the long run (several weeks), ciliated
   protozoan community coincides according to the MCRT in the three plants
   studied.
   The characterization of the fauna for each range of MCRT on the basis of
   the proposed model allows plant operation to be monitored by microscopic

Abstract = {{The effect of volatile fatty acids and trimethylamine on the
   nitrification activity of activated sludge was studied in laboratory
   batch experiments. The critical concentration of inhibitor I-k at which
   the activity ceases was determined by modelling. I-k values for ammonia
   oxidation were found to be 6 mM for isobutyric, 37mM for n-valeric, 6mM
   for isovaleric 36mM for n-caproic acid and 3 mM for trimethylamine. I-k
   values for nitrite oxidation were found to be 2 mM for formic, 115 mM
   for acetic, 68 mM for propionic, 33 mM for n-butyric, 8 mM for
   isobutyric, 75 mM for n-valeric, 7 mM for isovaleric and 81 mM for
   n-caproic acid. For propionic acid and trimethylamine, the undissociated
   compound appears to act as an inhibitor. For formic, isobutyric and
   isovaleric acids, the degree of inhibition seems to be determined by the
   total concentration of acid. Experiments with anaerobically treated

Abstract = {{In order to obtain syntrophic lactate degradation in a low-sulfate
   medium, first a methanogenic consortium consisting of Methanobrevibacter
   arboriphilus, Methanoculleus sp. and Methanothrix sp. was established in
   a fluidized-bed reactor with porous glass beads as a substratum and
   H-2/CO2/acetate as energy and carbon sources. Then the reactor was
   inoculated with a Desulfovibrio sp. strain L1 which had been isolated
   from a bioreactor degrading organic acids including lactate. Racemic
   lactate was fed to the reactor and in the absence of H-2 the substrate
   was rapidly oxidized to acetate, CO2 and hydrogen. After 1 day of
   operation suddenly propionate was produced by a very fast growing
   contaminating Clostridium sp., which was isolated thereafter. Growing on
   lactate the Clostridium sp. has higher mu(max) and K-s values than
   Desulfovibrio sp. strain L1. Based on these data it is concluded that
   under non-sterile conditions of full-scale anaerobic bioreactors,
   lactate degradation takes place via propionate as long as the
   concentration of lactate is high, while at low lactate concentrations
   and in the presence of methanogens the oxidative decarboxylation of
   lactate to acetate is the preferred pathway.}},

Abstract = {{The heterotrophic activity of different wastewater biocenoses is
   assessed. The biofilms originate from a sewer discharging domestic
   wastewater and from a sewer discharging trade wastewater with chromium
   and nickel contamination. The activated sludge was taken from the
   aeration tank from the high load stage (F:M ratio 0.8 kg kg(-1) d(-1))
   and from the low load stage (F:M ratio 0.1 kg kg(-1) d(-1)) of a
   two-stage municipal wastewater treatment plant. We determined the
   population density of heterotrophic saprophytes, polymer degrading
   bacteria, ammonifying bacteria as well as of nitrate reducers and
   denitrifiers. Enzyme activities were determined as relative substrate
   turnover rates for esterase, alpha- and beta-glucosidase, for
   phosphatase and for L-alanine-aminopeptidase. The population density of
   heterotrophic saprophytes was one order of magnitude higher in the high
   load stage compared to the low load activated sludge. The sewer biofilms
   showed one to two orders of magnitude higher counts per g dry weight for
   the heterotrophic bacteria as compared to the activated sludges. The
   turnover rates of esterase and L-alanine-aminopeptidase were higher than
   those of alpha- and beta-glucosidase and phosphatase. The sewer biofilms
   are highly active biocenoses both with respect to population densities
   as with respect to enzyme activities. Their heterotrophic activity is
   comparable with the one in high load activated sludge. Even the bacteria
   in the biocenosis which is exposed to high concentrations of chromium
   and nickel showed a high activity.}},

Abstract = {{A novel membrane bioreactor has been used to extract and biodegrade
   nitrobenzene (NB) and 3-chloronitrobenzene (3CNB) from an industrial
   wastewater arising in 3-chloronitrobenzene manufacture. This wastewater
   has a pH of less than 1.0 and an inorganic salt concentration of >5\%
   w/w and so would require some form of neutralization and pretreatment
   prior to conventional biological treatment. In contrast, using the
   membrane bioreactor the wastewater was successfully biologically
   detoxified without any form of pretreatment. The reactor system operated
   continuously for over 600 h and pollutant removal efficiencies of over
   99\% were observed at wastewater residence times of approx. 30 min. This
   was achieved through the use of a selective membrane in conjunction with
   specialized microorganisms enriched to degrade the target compounds. The
   NB and 3CNB were extracted from the wastewater across this membrane and
   biodegraded in an aqueous biomedium phase. The membrane bioreactor
   configuration described offers a range of advantages over conventional
   bioreactors due to the fact that there is no direct contact between the
   wastewater and the microorganisms.}},

Abstract = {{Batch sludge digestion studies were conducted under aerobic and
   anaerobic conditions to study: (i) the role of vinyl sulfone and
   hydroxyl functional groups in the removal of Reactive Black 5 dye; and
   (ii) the effect of biomass concentration on the removal of Navy 106
   (mixture of three ate dyes) from a textile mill wash water. Removals of
   color and organic content under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were
   compared. The potential of the dyes to leach from sludge in landfills
   was also investigated using the toxicity characteristic leaching
   procedure (TCLP).
   The vinyl sulfone group of the Reactive Black 5 dye enabled the dye to
   be removed better than the hydrolyzed form of the dye under aerobic
   conditions. Sorption and aerobic color degradation of Navy 106 wash
   water increased with increased biomass concentration in the reactors. An
   inhibition to color removal from dye wash water under aerobic conditions
   was detected at high color-to-biomass ratios. The inhibition was
   accompanied by a lower rate of nitrate and sulfate release. The total
   organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of hydrolyzed
   Reactive Black 5 dye and Navy 106 wash water decreased under aerobic
   conditions. Under anaerobic conditions, the color degraded within a day,
   but the TOC and COD of the pure dye and wash water did not decrease.
   TCLP extracts contained little, if any, of the dye added to the
   suspended growth reactors.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine the effects of a CO2
   treatment on the pH and soluble concentrations of inorganic contaminants
   in alkaline fly ash and spent shale solid wastes. A two-level (low and
   high), three-variable (moisture, time and pressure) statistical
   experiment was used to determine optimum CO2 treatment conditions.
   Treated and untreated samples were subjected to solubility and X-ray
   diffraction (XRD) studies. CO2 treatment conditions of 40 psi of
   pressure, 20\% moisture and 120 h effectively precipitated calcite, and
   thus lowered the pH and leachable concentrations of certain inorganic
   contaminants (e.g. Cd, Pb, Zn, Mn, As and Se) in alkaline fly ash and
   spent shale samples. For instance, approximate to 64-89\% reduction in
   the leachable concentration of Mn was observed for CO2 treated samples.
   Our results suggest that reaction with CO2 under slightly elevated
   pressures is an effective means of reducing the soluble concentrations
   of certain inorganic contaminants in alkaline solid wastes, which should
   prevent their migration from disposal environments into groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{An advanced oxidation process that combines ultrasound and ozone was
   studied in terms of its potential to oxidize natural organic matter and
   to determine whether the approach could extend the application of
   sonolysis to refractory electrolytes. Sonochemical enhancement of ozone
   decomposition rates has previously been attributed to ozone pyrolysis in
   the cavitation bubble or at the bubble interface. In this study,
   evidence from radical scavenging and dosimetry experiments confirms that
   ozone decomposition does not significantly occur in bulk solution during
   sonication. Under conditions of constant ultrasonic irradiation and
   continuous ozone gas application, total organic carbon (TOC) removal
   rates were enhanced by ultrasound. After 60 min of ozone and ultrasonic
   irradiation (55 W, 20 kHz), 91\% of the TOC in a 10 mg/l fulvic acid
   solution was removed and 87\% of the original carbon was removed as CO2
   (g). With ozone alone, 40\% of the TOC was removed and only 28\% of the
   original carbon was mineralized. Direct combustion of volatile
   intermediates in the cavitation bubble may partially explain the
   improved mineralization efficiency that was obtained with sonolysis.
   Hydroxyl radical scavengers, such as carbonate, were found to inhibit
   TOC removal rates. When the process was applied to a high-color
   groundwater sample, containing 2.8 mg l(-1) TOC and 35 mg l(-1)
   bicarbonate, TOC removal was completely inhibited. After pretreatment of
   the groundwater sample to remove carbonate species, however, 90\% of the
   TOC was removed in 40 min.}},

Abstract = {{In 1991 the numbers of actinomycetes in the water from the North
   Saskatchewan River, the colour of the water and the flow rate of the
   river were all found to increase coincidentally at the onset of spring
   runoff. These same conditions had previously been associated with odours
   in the treated water. When more than one hundred actinomycete isolates
   from water samples were tested for their ability to produce geosmin and
   2-methylisoborneol, the majority were able to produce one or both of
   these odorous compounds. When representative actinomycete isolates were
   tested for their susceptibility to disinfection with chloramine under
   conditions commonly encountered in water treatment processes, they gave
   CT99 values varying from a low of 3.6 to a high of 92 (mg/l min). This
   wide range of sensitivities seen in the small numbers of isolates tested
   suggests that chloramine-resistant odour-causing organisms could escape
   the water treatment processes during the spring runoff period. Odour
   problems could result from having these organisms become established in
   the distribution system. In addition to their ability to produce geosmin
   or 2-methylisoborneol, we found that two of three actinomycete isolates
   tested were able to transform the common pollutant and disinfection
   by-product 2,4,6-trichlorophenol into the extremely odorous compound
   2,4,6-trichloroanisole.}},

Abstract = {{The inoculation of subsurface soils with enriched indigenous microbes to
   enhance bioremediation is described. The technique, designed to rapidly
   increase subsurface populations of specific microorganisms, is tested in
   laboratory soil columns using benzene, toluene and xylene as organic
   target compounds and a natural aquifer sand as a subsurface medium. A
   short biologically active carbon adsorber is demonstrated to be an
   efficient reactor system for the growth, acclimation and enrichment of
   indigeous microorganisms for re-inoculation purposes, Empty-bed reactor
   contact times of approx. 40 s are shown to be sufficient for continuous
   production of effluent streams of enriched indigenous microbes for
   re-inoculation. The ability of the technique to rapidly increase
   populations of such microbes to levels above 10(5) cells g(-1) of dry
   solids in the previously uncontaminated aquifer sand studied is shown to
   result in enhanced rates of in situ degradation of the target
   hydrocarbons over a broad range of concentrations, from 25 to 9000 mu g

Abstract = {{A new biofilm reactor, the moving bed reactor, was studied for
   nitrification purposes. The study was partly on laboratory-scale with a
   prepared water, and partly on pilot-scale with primary or secondary
   effluent as feed water. The experimental results showed that when
   alkalinity was in excess and there was no organic load, either the
   ammonium or the oxygen concentration would be limiting for the
   nitrification rate. The shift from the ammonium to the oxygen
   concentration being rate limiting occurred for an oxygen to ammonium
   concentration ratio of about 3 g O-2 (g NH4-N)(-1). The oxygen
   concentration had a great influence on the nitrification rate when
   oxygen was rate limiting. The nitrification rate was then close to a
   first-order function of the oxygen concentration, indicating liquid film
   diffusion to be the important rate limiting mechanism. Nitrification
   rates were reduced by increased organic loads. When the organic load
   exceeded 5 g total BOD(7)m(2)d(-1), the nitrification became
   insignificant. With a secondary effluent feed, nitrification rates of
   0.7-1.0 g NOx-N (NO3-N + NO2-N) m(-2) d(-1) were achieved at oxygen
   concentrations between 4.5 and 5 g O-2 m(-3). Curves were constructed
   for nitrification at different organic loads when the oxygen
   concentration was rate limiting.}},

Abstract = {{A combined biofilm reactor-/microelectrode experimental set-up has been
   constructed, allowing for simultaneous reactor mass balances and
   measurements of concentration profiles within the biofilm. The system
   consists of an annular biofilm reactor equipped with an oxygen
   microelectrode. Experiments were carried out with aerobic glucose and
   starch degrading biofilms. The well described aerobic glucose
   degradation biofilm system was used to test the combined reactor set-up.
   Results predicted from known biofilm kinetics were obtained. In the
   starch degrading biofilm, basic assumptions were tested with the
   microelectrode measurements. It was established, that even with a high
   molecular weight, non-diffusible substrate, degradation took place in
   the depths of the biofilm. Intrinsic enzymatic hydrolysis was not
   limiting and the volumetric removal rate of oxygen was zero order.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation mechanisms of colloidal organic matter in biofilm
   reactors have been studied in an idealized laboratory reactor system
   with soluble starch as a model substrate. Batch tests and experiments
   with different reactor configurations have shown that for this specific
   substrate, bulk liquid hydrolysis is the mechanism for transforming
   non-diffusible organic matter into biofilm diffusible substrate. A
   simplified mathematical description has led to the identification of the
   degree of hydrolysis, D-H, as the parameter expressing the major
   difference between degradation of diffusible and non-diffusible organic
   matter in a biofilm reactor. D-H depends on the combined volumetric and
   surface hydraulic loading rate, Q(2)/(AV). In full-scale wastewater
   treatment plants, the degradation mechanism presented in this paper can
   explain important differences between the performance of trickling
   filters and RBC reactors.}},

Abstract = {{The anaerobic, anaerobic/aerobic (anaerobic followed by aerobic) and
   straight aerobic treatments of a simulated metal-cutting-fluid
   wastewater were evaluated in terms of the removal of organic nitrogen
   (primarily alkanolamines and heterocyclic compounds) and fatty acids,
   the two major constituents of many water-based metal-cutting fluids. The
   organic nitrogen was not well adsorbed on activated carbon but was
   degraded through the anaerobic/aerobic or straight aerobic treatment. It
   was also found that an acclimation period was necessary before the
   organic nitrogen could be anaerobically degraded.
   2-Methylhexanoic, heptanoic, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoic and benzoic acid,
   which were found in the wastewater, were degraded well both
   anaerobically and aerobically. The wastewater also contained a group of
   unidentified organic compounds that consisted of five gas
   chromatographic peaks (probably branched C-8-C-10 fatty acids or their
   esters). These unidentified organics were partially degraded and
   persisted in the effluents, contributing to the non-biodegradable
   portion of organics. Several low molecular weight fatty acids (acetic
   acid, propanoic acid, 2-methylpropanoic acid, butanoic acid,
   3-methylbutanoic acid and pentanoic acid) were produced during the
   periods when the influent chemical oxygen demand (COD) loading was
   varied to study the response of an anaerobic reactor to the variation.
   The anaerobic/aerobic treatment produced an effluent similar to that of
   the straight aerobic treatment with respect to fatty acid
   concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a study of the chemistry and structural
   characteristics of an unidentified product found in organic free aqueous
   solution in the chloramination disinfection of drinking water. Mass
   balance on decomposing chloramine solutions were made using
   spectrophotometric, titrimetric and ion chromatographic methods in the
   presence and absence of added nitrite. The concentration of the
   unidentified product was determined from the difference of the measured
   and predicted chloramine spectra.
   Nitrite is believed to have an important role in the formation of the
   unidentified product. Added nitrite can dramatically increase the
   concentration of this product, and it is believed that nitrite may be
   involved in its formation during slow chloramine decomposition. Nitrite
   is not expected to be stable in the presence of chloramines as predicted
   from prior studies. Nitrite was observed, however, in rapidly
   decomposing solutions of dichloramine. Nitrate, chloride and nitrite
   were observed in photolysis of the unidentified product. The
   unidentified product contains both nitrogen and chlorine, and has an
   estimated molar absorptivity of 5000 M(-1) cm(-1) from the mass balance
   of chloride if one chlorine per molecule is assumed. Nitrate was also
   observed along with the unidentified product in slow chloramine
   decomposition at near or above neutral pH; however, the unidentified
   product was not detected in chloramine solutions at pH 3.5, but nitrite
   was observed.
   The formation of the unidentified product is not believed to be acid or
   base catalyzed, but is proportional to the total oxidant lost in slow
   monochloramine decomposition. Monochloramine is not likely involved in
   the rate-limiting step in the formation of the unidentified product.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposed an empirical rate expression for the formation of an
   unidentified product generated in chloramine decomposition; the rate
   expression was incorporated into an existing model describing the fate
   and speciation in the chlorine-ammonia system. Specific rate constants
   were estimated based on experimental data and trial-and-errors computing
   technique.
   A simple mechanism was proposed for formation of the unidentified
   product. This mechanism hypothesized that an intermediate species was

Abstract = {{In combining open channel flows, blockage at the junction is manifested
   by the rise in the stage due to the effect of lateral inflow from the
   branch channel. Blockage results in pockets of flow where the flow
   velocity is very small and the depth of flow is large. The entry of the
   lateral flow into the main channel also throttles the main channel flow
   and results in an increase in the hydraulic resistance to flow which in
   turn leads to considerable energy losses. In the design of open channel
   networks, the expected increase in the flow depth near the channel
   junction permits one to estimate the height of the channel walls in the
   vicinity of the junction. A relationship between blockage and the ratio
   of the discharges is proposed on the basis of the energy principle.
   Using this relationship, one can predict blockage for a right-angled
   junction in combining flow. Using experimental results, the proposed
   relationship is verified.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of glucose concentration on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris
   and heterotrophic bacteria in mixed culture was studied. Granular
   glucose was fed daily as a source of organic carbon to provide an input
   concentration ranging from 25-700 mg/l. Growth rates of heterotrophic
   bacteria and algae increased with glucose loading rate but excessive
   loading rates were detrimental to the survival of the algae and
   bacteria. The maximum specific growth rates for the algae and bacteria
   were 1.58 and 1.70 d(-1), respectively. However, the saturation
   constants were significantly different with values of 27 and 174 mg/l
   for bacteria and algae, respectively. Under anaerobic conditions,
   bacterial density and algae growth were significantly affected by
   accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA). Although in low glucose
   loaded reactors, pH reached as high as 10.6, no significant effect of pH
   was observed on the survival of Chlorella vulgaris and heterotrophic
   bacteria. Inorganic carbon production increased with increasing glucose
   loading rate. When volatile fatty acids accumulated in anaerobic
   reactors, pH dropped resulting in a shift of equilibrium between H2CO3,
   HCO3- and CO32- in favor of H2CO3 production, most of which was released
   as CO2(g) to the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{The results of experimental trials with full scale, carbonaceous
   oxidation, activated sludge plants, at Manchester, were reported about
   30 years ago. An equation linking the activity of a sludge with its
   concentration was developed which showed that the active mass was a
   decreasing proportion of the sludge as its concentration was increased.
   This approach has now been extended to develop equations which explain
   why there was an optimum sludge concentration for each plant, which gave
   the required effluent quality for a minimum power consumption and which
   varied in direct relation to the square root of the load purified. This
   explanation has been supported by reference to the previous work, using
   three different methods for assessing sludge activity and points to the
   reaction within the flee being second order. Another conclusion has been
   that variation of active mass may produce a minimum rate of substrate
   removal, at a low active mass, but that increasing concentrations
   produce a steady increase in removal. Also in the plants, the rate of
   purification was limited by lack of oxygen and consideration of the
   strength of the sewage suggests that this is normal for conventional
   plants. Evidence has been presented to show that, as predicted by the
   second-order reaction rate hypothesis, the oxygen concentration
   necessary to maintain effluent quality, increased as the aeration period
   decreased.}},

Abstract = {{Although the modelling of deep bed filtration has progressed
   considerably in recent years, almost no attention has been given to
   simulating the process of slow sand filtration. The exception, to date,
   is the work of Woodward and Ta (1988) who have attempted to simulate
   slow sand tilter performance via a simple, empirical headless model;

   This paper describes the development and calibration of a computer-based
   numerical model based on assumed filtration coefficient and headless

Abstract = {{The penetration of light into waste stabilization ponds was studied
   because of its importance in pathogen removal and algal productivity.
   The attenuation of light in ponds was dominated by light absorbtion by
   gilvin (also called dissolved yellow matter or humic substances) and
   algae, light scattering processes (turbidity) being of no importance.
   Gilvin exerts a strong influence over the spectral variation and longer
   wavelengths penetrate much better than short wavelengths. Estimates of
   attenuation coefficients in the u.v. suggest that these wavelengths are
   less penetrating than previously reported. Differences in algal
   concentrations cause the differences in light attenuation seen between
   ponds, though they also cause some spectral variation because short
   wavelengths are more affected by changes in algal biomass than long
   ones. In the absence of algae there appears to be a lower limit to the
   clarity of ponds dictated by gilvin and other substances. Secchi disks
   were found to be reliable instruments for measuring light penetration.}},

Abstract = {{Bench scale column experiments were performed to determine the ability
   of granular activated carbon (GAC) to remove chlorite ion (ClO2-), the
   major by-product of chlorine dioxide, and chlorate ion (ClO3-), with or
   without natural organic matter, and under various operational
   conditions. Operational variances included the effect of pH, hydraulic
   loading, influent concentration and GAC particle size. Initially, all
   influent ClO2-, was reduced to C1(-) by GAC, but later carbon capacity
   for ClO2-, reduction was decreased and ClO2- breakthrough was observed.
   Chlorite ion reduction was improved by decreasing the natural organic
   matter concentration, decreasing pH, decreasing hydraulic loading,
   decreasing GAC particle size and increasing temperature. All other
   parameters were maintained constant, the most effective chlorite ion
   removal occurred at pH 5. The results may be of interest to many water
   utilities, which use activated carbon for removal of organic compounds
   and in filter adsorbers replacing anthracite coal. There was no

   Chlorate ion was not reduced by GAC, but was only physically and

Abstract = {{Short-term tests with benthic species have shown that certain cationic
   metals (cadmium, nickel, lead. zinc, copper) in sediments are not
   bioavailable when acid volatile sulfide (AVS) concentrations are
   sufficient to bind the metals, and/or when concentrations of metals in
   the sediment pore water are small. It was uncertain, however, whether a
   similar lack of bioavailability could be predicted when evaluating metal
   bioaccumulation in long-term exposures. In this study, we exposed the
   oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus to sediments from the lower Fox
   River, Wisconsin, which contained elevated concentrations of metals.
   Based on solid-phase metal and AVS measurements, or pore water metal
   concentrations, metals in the sediments were predicted to be of minimal
   biological availability. After a 30 day exposure to the test sediments,
   L. variegatus contained concentrations of metals not significantly
   greater than those in control oligochaetes exposed only to Lake Superior
   water. This indicates that metal bioavailability models based on
   sediment AVS content and/or pore water concentrations may be valid for
   long-term as well as short-term exposures of benthic species.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of an electrode-biofilm system to reduce nitrate has been
   experimentally demonstrated. In this system, a denitrifying biofilm is
   attached to an electrode and the H-2 produced by the electrolysis of
   water is used for the reduction of NO3- to N-2 gas. Complete
   denitrification was achieved in the presence of an electric current. A
   steady-state biofilm model describing the system is presented. The model
   takes into account the mass transfer rates, biological reaction rates
   and electrochemical reaction rates of H+, OH-, H-2, NO3- and supporting
   electrolytes. The denitrification rates calculated using the model are
   in fairly good agreement with experimental results. The net
   denitrification rate is affected significantly by the electric current
   and its response can be divided into three regions, namely, the
   `'linear,'' `'plateau'' and `'decline'' regions. The overall feasibility
   of the electrode-biofilm system is theoretically demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{During ozonation of seawater in closed marine systems, reduced chemical
   species such as bromide ion and, to a much lesser degree, chloride ion
   may be oxidized to a variety of potentially harmful products.
   Concentrations and stabilities of several of these products were
   measured for the artificial seawater aquarium The Living Seas, In this
   facility, where bromide ion was not originally added, trace amounts are
   present from impurities in NaCl. The total bromine concentration of the
   system is 57 mu M with the following speciation after 6 years of
   operation: 5 mu M bromate ion, <0.4 mu M hypobromite ion and 52 mu M
   bromide ion. To model the evolution of the observed speciation of
   bromine in this system. purr aqueous solutions of NaBr, NaCl and a mix
   of the two were ozonated. The results obtained, together with existing
   kinetic data, were used to develop a computer model of ozone reactions
   with artificial seawater. By applying the model to The Living Seas, we
   can account for the presently observed speciation of bromine. We
   conclude that even in an artificial seawater system where bromide ion is
   not added, this trace impurity is the dominant species oxidized during
   ozonation.}},

Abstract = {{Disinfection of drinking water by u.v. irradiation has been observed to
   reduce the biofilm formation in the pipes in a pilot plant. An
   apparently inhibitory effect that persists in the water after the u.v.
   treatment has been studied in the laboratory. Reduced numbers of viable
   bacteria and reduced bacterial metabolism were observed when irradiated
   waters were inoculated with fresh bacteria. Approximately 60\% of the
   heterotrophic bacteria in the water samples were inactivated within a Ih
   contact time with freshly u.v. disinfected water. The uptake rates of
   labelled tracer substances were significantly reduced when the bacteria
   were exposed to irradiated water. The inhibitory effect seems to last
   for at least 1 week. High concentrations of organic matter seem to
   counteract the inhibitory effect. No relationship was found between u.v.
   dose and effect within the dose range tested. The observed effects may
   be explained by the action of oxidizing reagents such as hydroxyl
   radicals, produced in photochemical reactions between u.v. irradiation
   and humic substances in the water.}},

   comparable to DHA, in pure cultures. Among three activity parameters
   (DHA, OUR and ATP) used to assess chlorine and hydrogen peroxide
   toxicity to the pure cultures and activated sludge, ATP was the least
   sensitive and the sensitivity of the other parameters was similar. S.

Abstract = {{Zebra mussels were suspended in sediment traps within 10-1. containers
   for 96 h in 1.5, 3.0, 7.5, 15 and 30\% activated sewage sludge. Water
   samples were removed at 1, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h and analyzed for
   turbidity, total phosphorus and BOD (5 days, 20 degrees C) and compared
   to values obtained from controls (i.e; containers with the same
   concentrations of activated sewage sludge but lacking zebra mussels).
   The amount of material deposited in the sediment traps (i.e.
   biodeposition) was compared to the amount deposited outside the sediment
   traps (i.e. biocontrols) and to control containers after 96 h. The rate
   of increase in water clarity and the rate of decrease in total
   phosphorus levels were significantly greater in containers with zebra
   mussels than in controls for all concentrations of activated sewage
   sludge tested. The mussels significantly reduced the BOD levels in
   containers with less than 3.0\% sludge within 48 h. In containers with
   zebra mussels, nearly all the seston and nutrients were biodeposited in

Abstract = {{Specific analytical techniques were used to study the behaviour of
   alkylphenol polyethoxylate surfactants (APnEO) in several full-scale
   mechanical-biological sewage treatment plants in the Glatt Valley,
   Switzerland. Both parent compounds and the major metabolic products were
   quantified. Untreated sewage and primary effluents contained
   considerable amounts of surfactant-derived nonylphenolic compounds
   (3.0-9.6\% of the dissolved organic carbon). Parent nonylphenol
   polyethoxylates (nEO = 3-20) were efficiently eliminated during
   biological treatment. However, the overall rate of biodegradation was
   limited due to the formation of biorefractory metabolites, including
   nonylphenol (NP), nonylphenol mono- and diethoxylate (NPIEO, NP2EO) and
   nonylphenoxy carboxylic acids (NPEC). The abundance of a particular
   metabolite was very dependent on the treatment conditions. Studies of
   the mass hows of nonylphenolic compounds in sewage treatment plants
   indicated that their fate was determined not only by microbial
   transformation, but also by physicochemical processes.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of nonylphenol polyethoxylate surfactants (NPnEO) and
   their metabolites in the Glatt River, Switzerland was studied. Discharge
   of secondary effluents from municipal sewage plants into the river was
   the predominant source of the investigated compounds. The majority of
   nonylphenolic compounds in the Glatt River were in the form of
   persistent metabolites, the most abundant being nonylphenoxy carboxylic
   acids. Distribution of the various classes of nonylphenolic compounds in
   the river was influenced to differing extents by biological and
   physico-chemical processes and was dependent on the compound class and
   the season. Biotransformation appears to be the predominant mechanism
   determining the fate of nonylphenolic compounds. High concentrations of
   lipophilic metabolites in river sediments indicate the importance of
   physico-chemical processes on the distribution of the nonylphenolic
   chemicals in natural waters.}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical method of disinfecting domestic effluents planned for
   use as irrigation water for edible crops was developed further, reaching
   a stage at which it can be used on an industrial scale.
   This disinfection method uses sunlight as the activation energy source;
   the oxygen dissolved in water (DO) as the oxidizing agent; and a
   dye-sensitizer (methylene blue) as an intermediary for the absorption
   and transfer of the sunlight energy to activate DO and/or to destabilize
   the organic matter molecules and the microorganisms as the oxidation
   target.
   The study was carried out in an experimental pilot-scale plant, capable
   of treating up to 50 m(3)/h of effluent supplied by an activated sludge
   sewage treatment plant located in the Tel-Aviv area. The plant consists
   of a series of 10 identical photoreactors (6 x 2 x 0.3 m(3)), installed
   in series on an unpaved road with a 2\% slope which ensures free
   overflow of the treated effluent through the pilot plant. Preceding the
   photoreactors there is a mixing reactor (2 x 2 x 1 m(3)) which supplies
   the effluent with DO (> 6 g O-2/m(3)), MB (0.7 +/- 0.1 g/m(3)) and
   calcium hydroxide (33 +/- 3 g/m(3)) for pH correction (8.7-8.9).
   Operating the pilot plant at an effluent flow rate of 33 +/- 3 m(3)/h
   (effluent detention time: 35 +/- 2 min), sunlight intensities 700-2600
   mu Em(-2)s(-1), the following decreases in microbial counts were
   observed (log counts): coliforms -3.2 +/- 0.3; fecal coli -3.12 +/- 0.2;
   fecal streptococci -3.9 +/- 0.3; poliovirus -1.9 +/- 0.25.
   The treated effluents did not show regrowth of these microorganisms
   during 7 days storage in photoreactors, and did not form an impermeable
   crust when infiltrated into sandy soils.
   The effluent disinfection cost in a `'sunlight disinfection plant''
   producing 200 m) disinfected effluent per hour is estimated to be U.S.\$
   3.95 per 100 m(3).}},

Abstract = {{The removal of phenols in the presence of copper and zinc by the aquatic
   weed, Eichhornia crassipes was investigated in order to assess its
   ability to clean up industrial wastewaters. Results indicate that
   Eichhornia has tremendous capacity to absorb phenolic compounds as well
   as Cu and Zn simultaneously from test solutions containing these
   substances. The presence of Cu or Zn resulted in decreased phenol uptake
   during the first 0.5 d, while the presence of Cu and Zn in combination
   resulted in higher phenol uptake. After 1 d exposure, however, little or
   no differences could be discerned. Similarly, absorption of Cu and Zn in
   the presence of phenols did not seem to be adversely affected by
   different combinations of Cu/Zn concentrations. In fact, some
   synergistic effect could be detected between Cu and Zn absorption by
   Eichhornia crassipes. Bioassays involving filtered Eichhornia root
   extract indicated that phenol was also removed by the aqueous root
   extracts indicating that cellular constituents of roots were involved in
   the process. The corresponding K-m and V-max for the enzyme-like
   substance were 0.58 and 8.97 mM phenol/h/g fresh root tissue,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Biochemical oxygen demand modeling in a river involves derivation and
   solution of the governing partial differential equation which describes
   concentration change with time and space brought on by convective,
   dispersive, and decay processes and the loading function. In this study,
   a sinusoidal variation in waste discharge concentration is considered.
   The governing partial differential equation is solved analytically by a
   transform method and by assuming that the solution varies periodically
   in time. The concepts of memory length and memory time are used to
   indicate when the solution becomes quasi-steady (periodic). The
   analytical solution is compared with two other solutions. The three
   solutions produce comparable results. However, the analytical solution
   is much easier to apply. The analytical solution extends the number of
   boundary conditions which a modeler can apply to describe real
   engineering problems.}},

Abstract = {{The factors influencing the nitrite accumulation during denitrification
   have been studied in a laboratory scale fluidized bed biofilm reactor.
   The nitrate and nitrite removal activity of two different biofilms were
   compared. A high residual nitrite accumulation (up to 30\% of the
   initial nitrate feed) was observed in the biofilm generated with Ps.
   aeruginosa as preponderant organism. In the biofilm with a preponderance
   of Ps. stutzeri the residual nitrite appeared only at very low hydraulic
   residence times below 0.25 h. The environmental factors (oxygen
   concentration) and the operating conditions (C/N ratio, nitrate loading,
   biofilm thickness) did not significantly influence the nitrite
   accumulation. The residual nitrite in the biofilm of Ps. stutzeri
   remained lower than that in the biofilm of Ps. aeruginosa, even under
   conditions of carbon source limitation, oxygen saturation and high
   nitrate loading up to 8.3 kg N-NO3- m(-3) d(-1). The more active biofilm
   was characterized by higher protein concentration and
   protein/polysaccharides ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Transformation of pesticides is dependent on soil environmental
   conditions and knowledge of this is necessary to improve subsurface fate
   and transport pesticide models. Laboratory experiments were performed
   using C-14 ring and isopropyl side-chain labeled atrazine
   (2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropyl-amino-s-triazine) applied to three
   Iowa soils incubated in batch reactors under different environmental
   conditions. Mineralization of both the ring and isopropyl side chain
   carbons was proportional to the organic matter content of the soils and
   oxygen content. Atrazine ring carbon mineralization also increased with
   soil water content. Oxygen limitation in soils reduced the
   bio-transformation rate of atrazine, and mineralization was much slower
   under denitrifying conditions. Empirical models were developed to
   represent the mineralization rate of atrazine ring carbon and isopropyl
   side-chain carbon for varying soil organic matter, soil water content,
   temperature, and oxygen partial pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption of hydrophobic organic compounds, such as polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), to particulate matter (diatomaceous earth) affects
   transformation rates by aqueous-phase hydroxyl radical. The reaction of
   three PCB congeners with hydroxyl radical (OH'), generated in a
   photo-Fenton system (i.e. iron, hydrogen peroxide and light at pH 3),
   was followed to evaluate predictive models of transformation kinetics in
   the presence of particulates. The OH' generated by this system only
   reacted with dissolved PCBs, and the overall rate of removal for each
   congener could be modeled using congener-specific data on desorption
   kinetics and solution phase reaction rates. Observed kinetics for the
   least hydrophobic congener evaluated, 2-monochlorobiphenyl, agreed with
   predictions based upon measured steady-state hydroxyl radical
   concentrations and second-order rate constants. 2,2',5-Trichlorobiphenyl
   was also oxidized by OH', but sorption to particulate matter resulted in
   slower transformation rates. A predictive model which utilized measured
   adsorption/desorption rate constants, steady-state hydroxyl radical
   concentrations and second-order rate constants adequately predicted
   2,2',5-trichlorobiphenyl transformation kinetics. Concentrations of
   2,2',4,5,5'-pentachlorobiphenyl, the most hydrophobic compound analyzed,
   did not change over the time scale of the experiments because dissolved
   concentrations were extremely low and desorption kinetics were very
   slow.}},

Abstract = {{Raw and treated sewage from physical-chemical and biological wastewater
   treatment plants were analysed for fatty acids and sterols by HPLC and
   GC. Raw sewage fatty acid and sterol concentrations varied widely during
   a diel cycle but their composition remained almost the same. Fatty acids
   were represented mainly by four components: 16:0, 18:0, 18:1(n-9) and
   18:2(n-6). Three 5 beta-stanols: coprostanol, 24-methylcoprostanol and
   24-ethylcoprostanol, accounted for 50-60\% of the total sterols, and the
   coprostanol/cholesterol and the 24-ethylcoprostanol/beta-sitosterol
   ratios were greater than 1. These characteristics were still
   recognizable in the treated sewage from physical-chemical and biological
   treatment plants. Removal was more efficient with the biological
   treatment than with the chemical one, especially for the dissolved
   compounds. It is estimated that 223 kg of fatty acids and 11 kg of
   sterols are released daily into the bay of Toulon by the Toulon-Est
   treatment plant while 74 kg of fatty acids and 5 kg of sterols are
   discharged into the Morlaix River estuary every day. In general, treated
   or raw sewages supply 0.1-8 g/day/cap of fatty acids and 0.01-0.6
   g/day/cap of sterols to the surrounding environment.}},

Abstract = {{High energy electron beam irradiation of benzene and toluene in aqueous
   solution results in their destruction and the formation of highly
   oxidized reaction byproducts. The product distribution depends upon
   absorbed dose and pH and results from the reaction of benzene and
   toluene with the hydroxyl radical (OH'), followed by continued oxidation
   of intermediate by-products. The dose required to remove 99\% (D-0.99)
   of the benzene from solution, at an initial solute concentration of 17.0
   mu M (1.3 mg l(-1)), was 95 krad (0.95 kGy, {[}OH'] approximate to 2.7 x
   10(-4) M). In the presence of a known radical scavenger, i.e. 3.3 mM
   methanol, a dose of 1510 krad (15.1 kGy, {[}OH'] approximate to 4.2 x
   10(-3) M) was required to achieve the same removal. Toluene showed
   greater removal, in the absence of methanol, than benzene under similar
   experimental conditions. The D-0.99 required to destroy an initial
   toluene concentration of 47.7 mu M (4.4 mg l(-1)) was 165 krad (1.65
   kGy, {[}OH'] approximate to 4.6 x 10(-4) M), whereas the D-0.99 for an
   initial toluene concentration of 16.4 mu M(1.5 mg l(-1)), in the
   presence of 3.3 mM methanol, was 2074 krad (20.7 kGy, {[}OH']
   approximate to 5.8 x 10(-3) M).}},

Abstract = {{In a powdered activated carbon (PAC)/water slurry reactor, each PAC
   particle has a different residence time, resulting in a distribution of
   residence times, called the exit age distribution. Two mathematical
   modeling approaches were compared with regard to handling the age
   distribution for a PAC/water slurry reactor which removes an adsorbate
   by adsorption. One approach implicitly includes the age distribution as
   part of the governing equations by developing them based on an
   age-averaged PAC particle whereas the other approach explicitly includes
   the age distribution by developing the equations based on individual PAC
   particles with various ages. The two approaches converged for a
   steady-state case where adsorption isotherm is linear. In addition, the
   former approach resulted in a much simpler set of equations as compared
   to that of the latter, resulting in much less numerical complexity for
   general cases.}},

Abstract = {{Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) are state of the art in

   from the application of an ADCP for suspended sediment monitoring in a
   fluvial environment with special respect to available state of the art
   monitoring methods. Both theoretical and some experimental results are
   presented based on investigations in a reservoir in the Austrian section
   of the Danube. The ADCP appears to be a valuable tool for detecting
   inhomogeneities in the suspended sediment transport and for determining
   sample locations. Additionally, it can be instrumental in temporal
   interpolation and regionalization between point values of parameters
   obtained by standard monitoring methods. Due to methodical limitations
   and the character of the fluvial suspended sediments, however, it cannot

Abstract = {{The ACTISCUM model, which represents a condensed summary of hypotheses
   related to `'scumming due to Actinomycetes'', is introduced. In order to
   simulate the competition between Actinomycetes and heterotrophic
   floc-forming microorganisms in activated sludge systems hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic (lipidic) substrates must be differentiated. The most
   important observations from practice may be simulated with the ACTISCUM
   model: small concentrations of surfactants and substantial
   concentrations of hydrophobic substrate may lead to the proliferation of
   Actinomycetes. Excessive growth of Actinomycetes may be suppressed by
   aerobic selectors at low solids retention times and by anoxic selectors
   at all solids retention times. For improved accuracy of model
   predictions the maximum specific growth rates, the lysis coefficients
   and the substrate half-saturation coefficients of heterotrophic
   floc-forming microorganisms and Actinomycetes and the hydrolysis
   constants should be subjected to further research. It is demonstrated
   with the ACTISCUM model that especially non-biodegradable, or only
   slowly biodegradable surfactants, may provoke a dramatic increase of the
   Actinomycetes population in the activated sludge. It is shown that
   inoculation of Actinomycetes favours their proliferation, a fact well
   known in practice. For certain wastewater compositions the anoxic
   selector has to be significantly enlarged in order to successfully
   suppress the Actinomycetes. Actinomycetes may be washed out at low
   solids retention times, but their washout always corresponds with a loss
   of the nitrifiers.}},

Abstract = {{Six anaerobic chemostats containing mixed microbial cultures were used
   to investigate the interactions between sulfate reduction and
   methanogenesis for three substrates: acetic acid, methanol and formic
   acid. Sulfate reducers outcompeted methanogens in acetate-fed chemostats
   while methanol was not utilized by sulfate reducers. In the formic
   acid-fed chemostats, competition was observed between methanogens and
   sulfate reducers with 62 and 24\% of the substrate utilized through
   sulfate reduction and methanogenesis, respectively. Iron was added to
   the sulfate-reducing chemostats to precipitate the hydrogen sulfide
   produced, thus eliminating sulfide inhibition and ensuring stable
   chemostat operation. This study involved the measurement of the
   oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) of the chemostats using a novel
   technique. Batch spike tests were also conducted to evaluate kinetic
   parameters for the degradation of different substrates. Although both
   methanol-fed chemostats were exclusively methanogenic, scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) analysis revealed the presence of two different strains
   of methanogens. This difference was also manifested by the ORP values
   and the kinetic parameters.}},

   effluent. An appropriate methodology for quantifying photoreactivation
   was identified. Photoreactivation was evaluated in relation to u.v.
   dose, exposure to photoreactivating light and various water quality
   parameters. An increase in u.v. dose is extremely valuable in minimizing
   photoreactivation events. A significant inverse relationship was found
   between average u.v. dose and photoreactivation of coliform in
   wastewater at both low and high u.v. doses. Increased levels of
   suspended solids had the effect of reducing the true u.v. dose reaching
   targeted organisms, thus reducing DNA damage and increasing subsequent
   photoreactivation. The dose of photoreactivating light was also observed
   to be an important parameter in the reactivating process.}},

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic parameters such as free energy, enthalpy and entropy of
   transfer from the bulk aqueous phase to the air-water interface at 25
   degrees C for 41 hydrophobic compounds of environmental interest are
   calculated from literature data on adsorption. The compounds considered
   are neutral, non-polar or slightly polar in nature. They comprise
   aliphatic hydrocarbons, halocarbons, formates, esters, branched alkanes,
   alcohols, acids and aromatic hydrocarbons and halocarbons. The trends in
   values among various homologous series of compounds are ascertained. A
   simple adsorption model based on interfacial energy changes predicts the
   values satisfactorily; however, the prediction is sensitive to the
   orientation of the molecule at the air-water interface. The free energy
   changes are linearly related to other water to solvent (octanol)
   partition constants. The significance of air-water interfacial
   adsorption parameters in high surface area environmental systems is
   discussed with special relevance to several important examples.}},

Abstract = {{Packed-bed bioreactors filled with diatomaceous earth (D.E.) pellets
   were used to evaluate the effects of competition between inoculated and
   invading microbial species on the spatial and temporal distribution of
   microorganisms within an individual pellet. The (D.E.) pellets were
   cylinders 6 mm in diameter and 5-10 mm long with a mean pore diameter of
   20 mu m. Bench-scale experiments evaluated competition between two
   distinct microbial species: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a motile, obligate
   aerobe (mu(max) = 0.4 h(-1)) and Klebsiella pneumoniae, a non-motile,
   facultative organism (mu(max) = 2.0 h(-1)). Organism growth rate
   appeared to be more important than motility or order of introduction in
   determining organism spatial and temporal distribution within the
   pellets. Pilot-scale experiments used pellets colonized with a
   pseudomonad growing on chlorobenzene as the sole carbon and energy
   source. Organic-rich ground water containing benzene, chlorobenzene and
   a population of indigenous microorganisms was used as feed. Pellet
   concentrations of the inoculated pseudomonad dropped from 10(9) to 10(6)
   colony forming units (cfu) ml(-1) pellet volume over 15 days. These
   experiments demonstrate that inoculated organisms within porous packing
   media may undergo significant loss in colonization numbers when faced
   with competition from faster growing organisms.}},

Abstract = {{This study compared manual and automatic sampling techniques at two
   urban creeks of varying faecal impact in Sydney, Australia, Changes in
   refrigerated (3 degrees C) automatic sampler samples were followed for
   up to 18h for total coliforms, faecal coliforms, total heterotrophs, pH,
   conductivity and turbidity. Significant differences (P = 0.000) in
   faecal coliform densities between manual and automatic samples 0.101
   log(10)cfu/100 ml were detected at the less impacted site. Also, total
   coliform levels decreased and then increased during refrigerated storage
   at the less impacted site. Total heterotrophs grown at 20 or 35 degrees
   C were not significantly (P > 0.05) affected by either the method of
   sampling or storage time. At both sites, the pH of manual samples was
   consistently lower than that of automatic samples and could not be
   accounted for by bottle type. In contrast, the higher conductivity of
   manually collected samples could largely be accounted for by the use of
   glass rather than plastic bottles. Conductivity at both sites decreased
   with storage time in plastic bottles. These results signify an inherent
   difference between samples collected manually and those collected
   automatically, but indicate that these differences are minimal in
   practical terms, particularly when water samples are polluted. Sampling
   technique and storage time appeared to be more critical when the level
   of contamination to be detected was low.}},

Abstract = {{The validation of a mass balance chloride (Cl) model for enriched
   Onondaga Lake is documented for the period 1973-1991. The history of
   loading of Cl to the lake, extending from the mining of NaCl brines
   adjoining the lake in the late 1700s, through the 102 year period of
   operation and discharges of an adjoining soda ash/chlor-alkali facility,
   is reviewed. Loads are estimated for the 1973-1991 interval based on a
   program of continuous flow measurements and bi-weekly monitoring of Cl
   concentration for the major inflows. The model performs well in matching
   the substantial seasonal variations in lake Cl concentration and the
   major reduction in concentration observed since closure of the facility
   in 1986 (from about 1585 to 430 mg 1(-1)). Projections with the
   validated model demonstrate the C1 concentration in the lake would be
   about 230mgl(-1), nearly 50\% lower than the present concentration,
   without the continuing waste input from the soda ash/chlor-alkali
   facility.}},

Abstract = {{The nature and fate of the organic fraction released during the aerobic
   thermophilic biodegradation of microbial cells were examined in a
   laboratory-scale treatment system. There was strong evidence for
   exoproteolytic activity during the early phase of the biodegradation
   process. The lysis products could be separated into two broad fractions,
   a low molecular weight C-2-C-5 carboxylic acid fraction and a pooled
   fraction of the remaining dissolved organic carbon (DOC). The former was
   produced as a result of fermentative metabolism of the aerobic
   thermophilic process culture growing under oxygen limited conditions.
   The production of these carboxylic acids occurred simultaneously with
   their utilization, as evidenced by the decrease in radioactivity in the
   DOC as a result of pulsing the culture with {[}C-14]acetate. However, a
   fraction of this {[}C-14]acetate pulse was metabolized into recalcitrant
   or slowly biodegradable DOC. The non-carboxylic acid fraction of the DOC
   in the lysis products was either slowly biodegradable or recalcitrant.
   The nature of the residual DOC in the supernatant after aerobic
   thermophilic treatment could not be further characterized but is likely
   to represent humic substances.}},

Abstract = {{Algicide treatment of an hepatotoxic Microcystis aeruginosa Kuetzing
   emend. Elenkin bloom on Lake Centenary caused cell lysis and the release
   of microcystin into the surrounding water. Where M. aeruginosa was
   confined to accumulations along the leeward shore of the lake, dissolved
   microcystin was detected for only 24 hours after spraying. It was
   presumed that the toxin was rapidly diluted by uncontaminated water from
   the main body of the lake. At an enclosed site in the south-west corner
   of the lake, microcystin persisted at high levels (1300-1800 mu gl(-1))
   for 9 days before degradation commenced. Microcystin degradation
   kinetics following this 9 day lag phase were bi-phasic with a rapid
   phase lasting 3 days (90-95\% loss), and a slower phase which continued
   until a flash flood on day 21. HPLC analysis and protein phosphatase
   assay revealed the same overall trend of microcystin release,
   persistence and then degradation. However, there was a rapid increase in
   protein phosphatase inhibition from day 5 to day 9 before degradation
   commenced. These results suggest that the initial bacterial
   transformation of microcystin resulted in a product more inhibitory to
   protein phosphatase than the parent toxin.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of cell immobilization to the anaerobic treatment
   process using the polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-boric acid method was
   investigated. The acetate-utilizing methanogens were cultivated,
   concentrated and immobilized. The beads formed were stable for one year
   maintaining methanogenic activity. The possible advantage of immobilized
   cells over non-immobilized cells for low pH shock and for the presence
   of toxic substances was examined. The immobilized cells recovered their
   methanogenic activity faster than the non-immobilized cells from the
   inhibition caused by transient low pH (5.0) for 12-48 h in a
   continuously fed reactor. Formation of a pH gradient within the bead due
   to the consumption of acetic acid inside the bead is a possible
   mechanism of relief of the inhibitory effect. Batch experiments showed
   that the inhibitory effect of phenol, oleic acid, nickel, sulfide and
   propionic acid on the methanogenic bacteria was also reduced by
   immobilizing the bacteria. Formation of a pH gradient or the adsorption
   of toxic materials by PVA are likely mechanisms of this relief of
   inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{The electro-oxidation of 1,4-benzoquinone in water solution was
   investigated. The benzoquinone concentration, intermediate products,
   DOC, COD and the toxicity of the oxidized solution was monitored during
   oxidation with Ti/IrO2 and Ti/SnO2 anodes (in the following text: IrO2
   and SnO2 anodes). It was found that the most important parameter is the
   nature of the anode. With the IrO2 anode the primary oxidation was
   attained, i.e. benzene ring rupture occurred, resulting in an
   accumulation of carboxylic acids formation as final non-toxic products.
   With the SnO2 anode, the carboxylic acids are formed in a much faster
   reaction and then oxidized, giving only CO2 as the final product.
   The detoxification of benzoquinone solution using both electrodes was
   determined in the course of the reaction by the Microtox test, activated
   sludge respirometric test and were also predicted using a developed
   formula. Calculated average toxicity, knowing the chemical composition
   of the oxidized solution, DOC and individual EC(50)s of the components
   were in agreement with observed values.
   The biodegradability of compounds in the solution at the end of
   electrolysis with the IrO2 anode was demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorinated aromatic compounds were oxidatively degraded by Fenton
   reaction (a chemical oxidation by H2O2 in the presence of Fe2+ as

   sludge without any acclimation with the products. This process was quite
   effective for decomposition of chlorobenzoates, chlorophenols,
   dichlorophenols and p-chlorobiphenyl. The methanogenic degradation of
   oxalate was found to be responsible for Oxalobacter formigenes and

Abstract = {{Electron microscopic (TEM) study of bacterial-sized planktonic fractions
   recovered from the water column samples of a small oligotrophic lake,
   consistently showed the presence of non-living organic and inorganic
   particles as prominent parts of the micro habitat. An all important
   objective of this work was to determine the composition and possible
   origins of the minute particles. They were of several morphological
   types, described by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) appearance
   as: spherical, oblong, cuboidal, plates and fibrillar. The TEM used in
   the scanning transmission mode (STEM) in conjunction with the Princeton
   Gamma Tech (PGT) System 4 energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX)
   allowed the determination of the elemental composition of individual
   particles.
   The particles referred to as spherical were electron dense and were less
   than 1 mu m in diameter. They were mainly composed of either Fe or Ti
   but not both. Cuboidal iron particles 37-75 nm in diameter were found in
   about equal abundance, but they were arranged in chains of individuals.
   Oblong particles were from 0.18 to 0.2 nm in width to 0.2 to 0.45 pm in
   length. Most were composed mainly of Ca, S and O but other elemental
   compositions were observed also. Plates with jagged edges composed of A1
   and Si were somewhat electron transparent. Both were less than 1 mu m in
   largest dimension. Fibrillar particles were most abundant and were
   composed of Fe, Si, C1, K, Na, O and C. They ranged from 90 Angstrom, to
   37 nm in thickness and 1 mu m to several p m in length. Particles of
   planktonic origin were observed with regularity including fragments of
   diatom cell walls and scales. These particles were composed of Si and O.
   Hexagonally shaped virus-like particles of several sizes were observed
   also. The relationship between elements in micro particles and their
   possible origins are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents and discusses an alternative approach, called fuzzy
   control theory, which can forecast and control complex, uncertain and/or
   highly-non-linear systems properly. Building the set of control rules is
   a very difficult task in fuzzy control and they are generated through
   on-line operation data in this study, not through experts' knowledge
   and/or operators' opinions, which is different from conventional
   applications. The fuzzy control theory can be conveniently used as an
   aid for automatic control, especially for complex and highly-non-linear
   systems. The steps using the fuzzy control technique are issued,
   compared and discussed in this paper and are demonstrated by a case
   study of a dynamic activated sludge process which is much more complex
   than other wastewater treatment systems. The effects of forecast and
   control of the fuzzy controller established from the derived fuzzy model
   are shown by computer simulation and verified by experiments. The
   results indicate that the forecast and control utilities of the fuzzy
   controllers are good and very helpful to the understanding of complex
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{In high velocity open channel flows, air is entrained at the free
   surface. This process is called self-aeration. In air-water flows the
   presence of air bubbles within the flow increases substantially the
   amount of air-water interface area and enhances the air-water transfer
   of atmospheric gases (e.g. nitrogen and oxygen). This paper presents a
   method to estimate the air-water interface area in uniform self-aerated
   flows on chutes and spillways. It is shown that the interface area is a

Abstract = {{Mercury toxicity on Selenastrum capricornutum was examined by a
   chemostat culture system. Phosphorus concentration within the system was
   controlled by means of maintaining different dilution rates of the
   chemostat. The study shows that EC(50) is consistently correlated with
   the phosphorus concentration. The sample correlation coefficient (r)
   between EC(50) and PO4-P concentration is found to be 0.87, which
   suggests that EC(50) is likely to be influenced by the phosphorus
   concentration. This phenomenon can be explained by a theory which
   describes the correlation between the tolerance and the activation
   level. The study indicates that nutrient conditions constitute an
   important factor in algal toxicity tests.}},

Abstract = {{Down-flow column studies were used in this research to investigate the
   ability of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate
   (DDBS), to facilitate transport of an isolate of Pseudomonas
   pseudoalcaligenes through a processed soil matrix under pressurized
   flow. The influences of bacterial density and the volume of bacterial
   suspension pumped were examined to determine their influence on
   bacterial transport in soil. Experiments were conducted using 6.35 cm
   diameter by 30 cm long stainless steel columns packed with a sandy clay
   loam. Bacterial suspensions were prepared using either water or
   surfactant solutions. The surfactant solution enhanced the transport of
   bacteria through soil columns at both bacterial densities of the pumping
   solution (10(10) and 10(8) cfu/ml) tested. Pumping a higher density of
   bacteria increased the number of bacteria recovered at all depths when
   either water or surfactant solutions were used. Increasing the volume of
   bacterial suspension pumped appears to cause significant pore blockage
   when water is used as the pumping suspension. However, use of DDBS
   facilitated the transport of bacteria by apparently reducing the extent
   of pore blockage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes work aimed at developing a statistics-based
   approach to classify water sites of an unknown biocorrosive class. Field
   surveys were performed at over 40 sites throughout Wisconsin for 2 years
   to investigate microbially influenced corrosion. More than 20
   water-related variables were measured. Aerobic bacteria and
   sulfate-reducing bacteria were isolated and their numbers in the water
   sample were counted. Steel coupons were installed and the corrosion
   rates were estimated using a gravimetric method. A visual examination
   rating system was adopted to evaluate the microbial corrosion rate and
   results showed that the visual examination rating was in agreement with
   the measured corrosion rate. Based on the stepwise regression analysis
   and discriminant analysis results, a set of classification rules was
   developed. By using these practical rules, the biocorrosive tendency of
   freshwater sites could be predicted. Furthermore, some valuable
   implications obtained from field surveys were summarized and explored.}},

Abstract = {{The haemolytic properties of phytoplankton toxins have been already
   demonstrated in many red tides. Although the detection of red blood cell
   (RBC) lysis is straightforward, it is not always easy to choose the most
   suitable type of RBC and incubation time. We have investigated these two
   points in order to obtain reproducible and quantifiable results, by
   applying the test to known haemolytic molecules. The dose-response curve
   is sigmoidal. The spiking technique allows a lowering of the detectable
   haemolytic threshold. Saponin and Kanagawa's haemolysin were used.
   Without previous concentration, the detection limit was at 4000 HU
   1(-1). A chloroform-methanol extraction allowed the detection limit to
   be lowered to 0.1 HU 1(-1). This method has been applied to the
   detection of a marine dinoflagellate whose exotoxin is haemolytic. It
   may be used for in situ detection of any haemolytic substance.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of biofilm thickness distribution (BTD) on
   substrate-inhibited kinetics in anaerobic filters was evaluated. The
   modeling results show that the kinetic behavior of normal BTD is
   different from that of uniform biofilm thickness when the substrate
   utilization rate of some biofilms is limited by diffusion or reaction.
   However, when all biofilms are either diffusion-limited or
   reaction-limited, kinetic behaviors of normal BTD and uniform biofilm
   thickness are identical. In addition, the BTD can reduce the apparent
   maximum substrate utilization rate and narrow the multiple steady-state
   region of substrate-inhibited kinetics. In this study, phenol was used
   as an inhibitory substrate. A general agreement was found between the
   numerical simulation results using the normal BTD and experimental
   results for anaerobic filters. On the contrary, numerical simulation
   using uniform biofilm thickness failed to predict the outcome of the
   experiments. This indicates that an anaerobic filter is composed of a
   biofilm with varying thickness and thus, the BTD of a filter is of great
   importance, especially for treating wastewater containing inhibitory
   substrates.}},

Abstract = {{A series of samples taken during a rain storm from two streams feeding
   into a small lake were analysed for major ions and radiocaesium. Changes
   in Cs-137 content in both streams showed no relationship to ammonia or
   dissolved organic carbon concentrations, suggesting that neither
   competition at illitic frayed-edge sites nor chelation of radiocaesium
   were important remobilization processes. One stream contained
   significantly higher dissolved radiocaesium concentrations than the
   other. In the former stream, peaks and troughs in radiocaesium
   concentrations corresponded with changes in calcium, pH and alkalinity.
   However the pH was related directly with the radiocaesium, whereas the
   proposed mechanism of humic mediated sorption to solids would infer an
   inverse relationship with pH. The positive Ca and pH relationships with
   radiocaesium implied that, in the flooded fibrous-peat soils (peat bogs)
   encountered in its subcatchment, radiocaesium was sorbed to the soils by
   simple ion exchange processes.}},

Abstract = {{The investigation of the Mushim-chun estuary system, containing a number
   of well-defined point sources of domestic effluents, was carried out
   during 7 months of the dry period (October-March). The analyses of
   stream water show that the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn in the
   samples from urban areas affected by domestic effluents are
   significantly higher than those from rural upstream. The survey of the
   stream bottom sediment was also carried out during March, when
   sufficient quantity of the suspended sediment fraction settling on the
   stream bottom is uniformly incorporated into the stream bottom sediment.
   The results of the sediment analyses show that the top sediment layer
   (similar to 0-2 cm), comprising predominately of <63 mu m fraction, is
   geochemically important for source assessments. The stream sediment
   geochemical anomaly is caused by the discharge of wastewater, containing
   large amounts of trace Cu, Pb and Zn in both the dissolved and
   particulate phases, from overcrowded residential areas. The analysis of
   topsoils from the stream banks and road dusts from the adjacent roads
   suggest that there are no major non-point anthropogenic sources located
   along the banks of the Mushim-chun estuary system.}},

Abstract = {{The cell immobilization technique using polyvinyl alcohol and boric acid
   was applied to the anaerobic process. Immobilized cells of Clostridium
   butyricum were used to enhance butyrate production in a continuous
   reactor under a mixed culture condition. There was a tendency that more
   butyrate was produced in the immobilized cell system than in the
   non-immobilized cell system at (1) a dilution rate lower than 0.14 h(-1)
   at pH 6 and (2) a pH higher than 5.5 with a dilution rate of 0.036
   h(-1). The enrichment culture of the propionate-utilizing consortium was
   immobilized and used in a mixed culture condition with suspended biomass
   which could convert glucose to methane. Batch experiments using this
   mixture of biomass and those using non-immobilized cells alone were
   carried out. Methane production from acetate, propionate or glucose
   proceeded much more rapidly, and accumulation of propionate during
   glucose degradation was much shorter when the immobilized cells were
   used.}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature operation has been reported to increase the yield of
   volatile suspended solids (VSS) but little quantitative data are
   available and an explanation for the reported phenomena is lacking. A
   laboratory study was initiated using two parallel 4 l. sequencing batch
   reactors operating at a sludge retention time (SRT) of approx. 10 days,
   and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of approx. 1.25 days. An
   experimental design with two levels of temperatures (8 and 20 degrees C)
   and two levels of influent volatile solid concentrations (approx. 15 and
   70 mg/l) was selected.
   The experimental results verified the hypothesis that the observed yield
   (g Delta VSS/g Delta COD) increased at lower temperatures for both
   levels of influent suspended solids. As, experimentally, it was not
   possible to determine the relative composition of the accumulated
   volatile solids, the IAWPRC activated-sludge model was adapted to
   estimate the fractions of: viable organisms, accumulated influent
   particulates and endogenous decay products. The simulations indicated
   that the actual concentration of viable organisms apparently decreased
   from approx. 52-63\% of the MLVSS at 20 degrees C to 29-47\% at 8
   degrees C. Simulations were utilized to estimate the additional waste
   sludge production during cold weather at typical treatment plants.
   Increases of approx. 12-20\% could result.}},

Abstract = {{In alternating type activated sludge nutrient removal processes, the
   denitrification rate can be limited by the availability of
   readily-degradable carbon substrate. A control strategy is proposed by
   which an easily metabolizable COD source is added directly to that point
   in the process at which denitrification momentarily occurs. This
   approach serves to increase the denitrification rate on demand, thereby
   allowing the accumulation of nitrate and nitrite during periods of peak
   nitrogen loading to be reduced or avoided. A pilot plant demonstration
   of the control strategy using acetate as COD source is provided, showing
   a marked improvement in effluent water quality as compared to the
   uncontrolled case. An examination of the resulting denitrification rates
   illustrates the direct proportionality between these rates and the rate
   of COD addition.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing demands on discharged water quality have led to the
   development of activated sludge processes which incorporate the
   biologically mediated removal of nitrogen and phosphorus. A major
   obstacle in the development of new control strategies for such processes
   is the lack of variables which can effectively alter process behavior
   and can feasibly be manipulated This two part paper deals with a novel
   means to improve the nitrogen removal in an alternating type nutrient
   removal activated sludge process through control of the cycle length. In
   this first part, an analysis of process dynamics is undertaken. Using a
   simple model to describe the nitrogen dynamics in the alternating
   process, the existence of an optimal cycle length as a function of
   process conditions is demonstrated and explained. A graphical technique
   is developed which allows quick visualization of nitrogen dynamics under
   constant process conditions. This also serves as a means to assess
   whether a selected cycle length is optimal, too long, or too short for a
   given set of conditions. Based on the findings of this first part, the
   second part of the paper develops and demonstrates control strategies
   which serve to automatically adjust the cycle length to compensate for
   changing process conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The first part of this two part contribution dealt with an analysis of
   nitrification and denitrification in an alternating activated sludge
   nutrient removal process for the case of constant process conditions.
   The existence of an optimal cycle length, which is a function of the
   process conditions, was demonstrated and discussed. Based on these
   findings, this paper examines a control strategy by which the cycle
   length of an alternating activated sludge nutrient removal process is
   automatically adjusted in order to compensate for changing process
   conditions. Two control algorithms are proposed. One involves
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control which requires minimal
   process information and computational effort. The second is a model
   based predictive control (MBPC) technique, which introduces a
   feedforward element into the control strategy. The MBPC technique is
   examined using a relatively simple process model. The results of
   experimental demonstrations of these two algorithms in a pilot plant
   facility indicate their potential towards improving nitrogen removal in
   the alternating process.}},

   quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) technique is
   proposed for predicting the concentrations of the components of a

   activated carbon followed by neutron activation analysis. AOX formation
   per unit organic carbon was similar in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic
   fractions, but the hydrophobic fraction produced more mutagenic activity
   and MX than the hydrophilic one. The humic acid fraction produced
   slightly more mutagenicity and MX than the fulvic acid fraction per unit
   organic carbon. However, there are more fulvic acids than humic acids in
   natural waters and therefore fulvic acids contribute more to the

Abstract = {{The adsorption of three humic substances isolated from the River Dodder
   (Eire) and one commercial humic acid (Aldrich) by six minerals was
   studied and found to be influenced by mineral type, the nature of the
   humics and by the solution characteristics. Adsorption was heavily
   pH-dependent, with lower uptake at higher pH values due to increased
   ionization of the humic substances. The amount of humic substances
   adsorbed was in the order: Aldrich humic acid > Dodder humic acid >
   Dodder fulvic acid > Dodder hydrophilic macromolecular acid
   corresponding to a decreasing aromatic carbon content and increasing O/C
   ratio. Desorption experiments showed Aldrich humic acid was the most
   difficult to be desorbed, followed by Dodder humic acid, Dodder fulvic
   acid then Dodder hydrophilic macromolecular acid. Humic uptake was found
   to increase with ionic strength due to the neutralization of charges on
   both mineral surfaces and humic substances, and more importantly, the
   compression of diffuse double layers; this also showed that van der
   Waals attraction is an important part of the interactive forces between
   humic substances and mineral particles. The amount of humic substances
   adsorbed varied with mineral type, particle size and surface area, with
   aluminium oxide having the highest capacity. The effect of temperature
   on humic adsorption was shown to vary with humic type and two types of
   reaction mechanism have been proposed responsible for the humic-clay
   interactions.}},

Title = {{MONITORING RESPONSE OF XAD-CONCENTRATED WATER IN THE RHINE DELTA - A
   MAJOR PART OF THE TOXIC COMPOUNDS REMAINS UNIDENTIFIED}},

Abstract = {{In this study a part of the organic compounds present in Rhine water was
   isolated by XAD-resins and fractionated. Isolates as well as fractions
   were tested for mutagenicity and toxicity. The highest mutagenic effects
   in the Ames test were observed with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98
   in the pH 7 isolate. Comparison of past data showed that mutagenicity
   remained the same in the period 1980-1990. The water samples had to be
   concentrated at least 25 times by XAD to induce short-term mortality in
   waterfleas (Daphnia magna), which indicates a substantial improvement in
   comparison with pollution during the seventies. Chronic toxicity was
   observed in Daphnia magna after lower levels of XAD-concentration.
   Extrapolation of these results to field cladocerans is discussed.
   Most mutagenicity was recovered in the moderately hydrophilic
   diethylether, ethylacetate and ethanol fractions, but toxicity was
   almost exclusively located in the lipophilic cyclohexane fraction.
   However, assuming concentration addition to be dominant in mixtures, the
   major part (more than 89\%) of the toxicity in the cyclohexane fraction
   could not be attributed to the GC-MS-identified compounds, for which
   EC(50) values were obtained from databases. Several probable causes for
   this discrepancy are discussed. However, the major contribution lacking
   is expected to be from identified compounds for which no information was
   found in the databases or from compounds that could not be identified by
   GC-MS.
   It is concluded that the emission reduction along the Rhine should
   continue, with a more important role for toxicological assays.
   Our study did not cover metals, very hydrophilic or very lipophilic
   compounds.}},

Abstract = {{Anaerobic degradation of three dihydric phenols, viz., resorcinol,
   catechol and hydroquinone was studied in mono and binary substrate
   systems in three upflow anaerobic fixed-film fixed-bed reactors of
   similar dimensions. In order to predict the metabolic pathways existing
   in the microbial consortia for anaerobic degradation of these compounds,
   downstream intermediates of reductive and carboxylation pathways for
   phenol were fed to the three reactors acclimated to the three dihydric
   phenols. Catechol and hydroquinone acclimated reactors demonstrated
   marginal degradation of the downstream intermediates of the reductive
   pathway for phenol, viz., cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone. However, the
   same reactors could degrade benzoic acid, which is the downstream
   intermediate of the carboxylation pathway for phenol, to the extent of
   83\%. This indicates good expression of the carboxylation pathway in
   these two reactors. The resorcinol acclimated reactor, on the other
   hand, degraded cyclohexanol, cyclohexanone and benzoic acid with poor
   efficiency suggesting that the majority of resorcinol is catabolized by
   a hitherto unknown pathway. Binary mixture studies revealed that
   utilization of catechol and hydroquinone from the binary mixed feed in
   resorcinol acclimated reactor was poor. In the catechol acclimated
   reactor, catechol aided better utilization of resorcinol when compared
   to that of hydroquinone. In the hydroquinone acclimated reactor, high
   resorcinol utilization efficiency was seen from the resorcinol-catechol
   mixed feed. The study highlights the biochemical specificity acquired by
   microbial consortia when exposed to different substrates for
   acclimation.}},

Abstract = {{Results of groundwater denitrification experiments using a USB reactor,
   with ethanol as the carbon source, indicate that it can efficiently
   treat affected water. However, this type of reactor was found to be
   strongly affected by the hardness of the water as a result of changes in
   the mineral fraction of the granules. During a period when water
   containing between 150 and 380 mg/l (average of 244 mg/l) of hardness
   (as CaCO3) was used, floating sludge and biomass washout occurred as a
   result of a low granule mineral content, 10-15\% of TSS, and a gradual
   increase in granule size, accompanied by poor settling characteristics.
   When water of higher hardness was used, 380-450 mg/l as CaCO3, high
   biomass concentrations of 30-40 g/(1 sludge blanket) were maintained in
   the reactor. This high concentration resulted from the development of
   granules having good settling characteristics and containing about 25\%
   minerals (CaCO3) with very low SVI values (between 15 and 30). Under
   these conditions the USB reactors exhibited stable operation with
   volumetric loading rates of up to 4 kgN/m(3{*})day, corresponding to a
   retention time of 8 min.}},

   After a short sample pretreatment the sample was analyzed using
   reversed-phase ion-pair liquid chromatography. Ultraviolet absorbance
   detection was applied at 254 nm. The method is suitable for the
   determination of EDTA in surface water, bank filtrate, infiltrated water
   and drinking water. The method is simple and has a low limit of
   detection (0.8 mu g/l). In general, the method provides calibration
   curves with good regression characteristics (correlation coefficient >
   0.998). To determine the concentration of EDTA 31 samples from several
   Dutch water companies were analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{A 2-fold research was conducted on samples from the Elbe river in West
   Germany. One objective of the study was to estimate to what extent
   marine solids are transported upstream and to evaluate the origin and
   behaviour of the sediments. In addition, we hoped to acquire a better
   insight about the impact of a major discharge event and of the Hamburg
   harbour on the composition of the suspended particulate matter. Two
   different kinds of samples were studied by single particle analysis
   using an automated electron microprobe to pursue these objectives:
   sediment samples from a longitudinal profile collected in 1986 and
   suspended matter samples from a maximum peak flow discharge event in
   1988.}},

Abstract = {{The general activated sludge model proposed by the IAWPRC Task Group on
   modelling of the activated sludge system represents a truly fundamental
   approach to modelling and design of biological treatment systems.
   Modifications to the model have attempted to further refine the model to
   more accurately simulate the biological processes. Further research into
   the behaviour of activated sludge systems incorporating biological
   phosphorus removal have demonstrated that further refinement of the
   model is required with particular reference to denitrification kinetics
   in the primary anoxic reactor of the Modified UCT system.
   A modification to the IAWPRC model is proposed which permits
   predetermination of denitrification rates. Extension of this
   modification may well provide insight into the effect of `'selectors''
   on activated sludge systems and the varying specific growth rates
   measured for both heterotrophs and autotrophs.}},

Abstract = {{The phytoplankton community structure, productivity and biomass of seven
   southeastern United States cooling reservoirs were investigated between
   1979 and 1986, with emphasis on data from 1984 to 1986. These reservoirs
   represented a variety of trophic states and geographic provinces, and
   included three piedmont systems, two coastal plain systems and one each
   in the mountains and sandhills. The study reservoirs differed from
   northern temperate lakes in seasonal phytoplankton taxonomic patterns,
   the dominance of flagellated chrysophytes and cryptomonads, lack of
   spring diatom blooms and generally low abundance of blue-green algae,
   particularly in the larger systems. The small reservoirs were more
   susceptible to algal blooms, caused by nutrient trapping and elevated
   temperatures from thermal loading. Direct thermal discharge effects upon
   the phytoplankton communities were either localized or non-significant,
   depending upon site-specific circumstances. Indirect effects of thermal
   loading caused ecosystem-wide alterations both from top-down(fish) and
   bottom-up (phytoplankton) effects. In one acidic reservoir, power-plant
   operational changes reduced concentrations of water-column metals, with
   major concurrent alterations in phytoplankton taxonomic structure.}},

Abstract = {{Bench scale (201.) UASBRs were evaluated for continuous treatment of
   effluent from a Corn Wet Milling operation (Casco, London, Ontario,
   Canada). The plant effluent contained low molecular weight carbohydrates
   and salts (daily averages 780,000 USGPD, 720 ppm TOC). Early in the
   study, anaerobic granules experienced a 2 days shock loading from large
   fluctuations in pH, temperature, high BOD and sulfite concentration.
   After this shock, reactor productivity declined but granules remained
   active and produced gas. In the days that followed, the granules lost
   their ability to settle and began to float to the top of the reactor.
   The effect and recovery of the granules after the shock loading were
   investigated in two reactors: R1 (with nutrients) and R2 (without
   nutrients). Nutrient addition resulted in increased biomass accumulation
   but granules were not regenerated. A control reactor (R4) which did not
   experience this shock loading maintained normal operation for more than
   60 days.}},

   adsorption of organic chemicals on activated carbon were developed using
   molecular connectivity. The QSARs were based on adsorption data for 363

   sources, representing a wide range of aromatic and aliphatic chemical
   classes. In order to test the predictive capabilities of the QSAR
   equations and to illustrate their use, the QSARs were applied to data
   from three additional data sources. The existence of divergent
   literature values for the same chemicals was addressed in one QSAR by a
   `'dummy variable'' to identify the data source. The resulting QSARs are
   well suited for use in the water treatment industry because they are
   based on a wide range of chemicals, use readily calculated parameters,
   and represent adsorption at low adsorbate concentrations. However, in
   applying QSARs based on literature data, it is imperative to consider
   the relevance of the data source to one's own investigative situation.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen removal efficiency was studied in a biofilter system consisting
   of two flooded, statically packed bed biofilters (reactors A and B) with
   aerobic and anaerobic microsites. During the experimental period the
   reactors were integrated into a quasi-closed recirculated fish culture
   system. In two experiments the degradation efficiency of dissolved
   oxidized nitrogen compounds (NOx-N = N-2(-)-N+NO3--N) was measured with
   and without oxygen supply. The oxygenation system consisted of silicone
   membranes integrated into the filter-bed and supplied with technical
   oxygen. The carbon source during the experimental period was methanol.
   The efficiency of NOx-N removal for reactor A (without oxygenation) was
   55\%. With oxygenation, degradation efficiency of reactor A increased to
   a maximum of 86\%. The maximum NOx-N degradation efficiency of both
   biofilters (reactors A and B) reached 97\% when connected in series.
   Shifting of the bacterial populations as well as a linkage of the
   nitrogen transformations in the aerated and unaerated microsites are
   discussed as possible reasons for the higher nitrogen removal rates.}},

Abstract = {{First part of the Kis-Balaton reservoir was opened in 1985 in order to
   reduce phosphorus loading of Lake Balaton. Adsorption and release of
   sediment-phosphorus which significantly affect the efficiency of this
   eutrophication management measure, were studied at five stations in the
   Kis-Balaton reservoir under different pH and redox conditions. Release
   experiments were combined with pre- and postfractionations of sediment
   phosphorus.
   The adsorption/desorption concentration limit (L(A/D)) and cumulative
   phosphate release followed the same pattern, i.e. pH = 7.9 < pH = 7.9
   N-2 < pH = 8.8 < pH = 8.8 N-2. Both L(A/D) and release increased with
   the initial `'iron- and aluminium'' phosphorus (NaOH-RP) contents of the
   sediments. The NaOH-RP fraction was highly saturated with phosphate near
   the inflow of the Zala River, while in the downstream areas it was not.
   Sediments with high humic contents adsorbed phosphate efficiently, and
   released only small amounts of phosphate under any conditions.
   Internal phosphorus loading of the reservoir may be enhanced by high pH
   in the water and anaerobic conditions both in the sediments and bottom
   water during the period of intense algal production. It was estimated
   that the internal P loading may be similar to external loading under
   these conditions.}},

   exceeding approx. 0.7 g-N/l, at the applied retention time of 15 days.
   When the ammonia load was high, reduction of the temperature below 55

Abstract = {{The content of the water-soluble vitamins thiamine, riboflavin and folic
   acid was determined in the dry solids and the water phase of activated
   sludge and digested sludge respectively, in municipal and industrial
   wastewater treatment plants. Thiamine and riboflavin were determined by
   fluorimetric detection. Folic acid was determined by means of
   microbiological assays. Dry solids of activated sludge from municipal
   wastewater treatment plants contained 1.1-6.6 mg kg(-1) thiamine,
   17.6-43.2 mg kg(-1) riboflavin and 10-13 mg kg(-1) folic acid with 1-6
   mu gl(-1) thiamine and 9-25 mu gl(-1) riboflavin in the water phase. Dry
   digested sludge matter contained 0.9-6.0 mg kg(-1) thiamine with a
   content of the water phase after filtration of 18-386 mu gl(-1),
   riboflavin was 3.2-10.8 mg kg(-1) and 6-116 mu gl(-1), respectively,
   folic acid was 0.25-0.62 mg kg(-1) in the dry solid matter, none was
   found in the water phase. Dry solids of activated sludge from industrial
   sewage treatment plants contained 1.9-29.1 mg kg(-1) thiamine, the water
   phase after filtration contained 3-14 mu gl(-1), riboflavin was 21.3-41
   mg kg(-1) with 1-26 mu gl(-1) in the water phase, folic acid was 2 mg
   kg(-1) in the dry solids of activated sludge. The vitamin content varies
   in different sludge fractions. The requirements of heterotrophic
   saprophytes for thiamine and riboflavin should usually be met by the
   vitamin content;in the sludge. Before dosing the vitamin content should
   be monitored.}},

Abstract = {{A more detailed characterization of organic matter in domestic
   wastewater than given by the bulk parameters BOD, COD and TOC is needed
   to increase the knowledge about transformations in sewer systems and the
   quality of wastewater as input to the wastewater treatment processes. In
   this paper results of various selected methods optimized for analysing
   pools of carbohydrate, protein and lipid in domestic wastewater were
   described and discussed. The most suitable method for measurement of
   protein was the method of Lowry et al. (1951), for carbohydrate it was
   the anthrone method originally introduced by Dreywood (1946) and for
   lipid it was an infrared method modified from Standard Methods (APHA ct
   al., 1985). The modified methods showed high precision and compounds in
   the wastewater did not seem to interfere. The results of the methods
   were, however, slightly influenced by the choice of standard.
   A case study was performed using the methods for characterization of
   wastewater from catchment areas of different characteristics. The
   fractions of total protein, carbohydrate and lipid of total COD were, on
   average, 28, 18 and 31\% with standard deviations of 4, 6 and 10\%,
   respectively. The dissolved carbohydrate fraction varied
   considerably-10\% as an average of dissolved COD, and 7\% as standard
   deviation, presumably due to degradation in the sewers influenced by
   differences in residence times.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of molecular oxygen in the test environment promotes
   oxidative coupling (polymer formation) of phenolic compounds on the
   surface of granular activated carbon (GAC). Both adsorption equilibria
   and adsorption kinetics are affected by these chemical reactions. Lack
   of molecular oxygen interference with adsorption kinetics during the
   initial phase (first 12 h) of adsorbent-adsorbate contact, observed for
   the experimental conditions tested, can be explained by the lower rate
   of adsorbate polymerization when compared to the rate of pure
   adsorption. The homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM) adequately
   describes adsorption kinetics under anoxic conditions, but it fails to
   accurately predict experimental data collected in the presence of
   molecular oxygen. For the experimental conditions tested in this study,
   GAC particle size did not influence the magnitude of the surface
   diffusion coefficient. However, the increase in the initial adsorbate
   concentration yielded an increase in the surface diffusion coefficient.
   This may be attributed to a decrease in the adsorption forces for higher
   surface coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous-flow activated sludge reactors were used for the treatment of
   photoprocessing wastewaters from two commonly used photoprocesses,
   namely KODAK Flexicolor Process C-41 (film processing) and KODAK
   Ektacolor Process RA-4 (paper processing). Simulated wastewaters were
   fed to laboratory-scale reactors at a loading level of 10\% (v/v) along
   with a synthetic base feed. The biodegradation of the base feed was not
   affected by the photoprocessing wastewaters. In addition, more than 36\%
   of the photoeffluent-derived chemical oxygen demand (COD) was destroyed,
   primarily as a result of sulfite and thiosulfate oxidation. Ethylene
   diamine tetraacetate (EDTA) was recalcitrant and accounted for a
   significant fraction of the effluent COD. The photoeffluent-amended
   reactors showed a decrease in ammonia removal as compared to the control
   reactor (fed only the base feed). Significant consumption of alkalinity
   was observed in the photoeffluent-amended reactors due to the oxidation
   of sulfite, thiosulfate and ammonia. Acute toxicity bioassays using two
   species, fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) and a daphnid (Daphnia
   magna), revealed that the activated sludge treatment rendered the
   photoprocessing wastewaters non-toxic to the test organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of textile wastewaters from several dyeing and finishing mills
   by an electrochemical method is investigated. The batch experimental
   results are assessed in terms of color (turbidity) and COD reductions.
   Several operating variables, such as the wastewater conductivity, pH,
   power requirement and amount of polyelectrolyte added, are explored to
   ascertain their respective effects on the treatment efficiency. Optimum
   operating ranges for each of these operating variables are
   experimentally determined. The electrochemical method is found to be
   quite effective and is highly competitive as an alternative chemical
   method for treating textile wastewater. A continuous experimental
   apparatus is designed and test runs are performed using the operating
   conditions obtained in the batch experiments. The preliminary data show
   similar satisfactory results to those of the batch runs.}},

Abstract = {{This laboratory study determined the composition of the off-gas after
   wet oxidation (WO) of trinitrotoluene (TNT) red water, and monitored
   bacterial toxicity of treated waste. The amount of sulfate concentration
   in the treated sample is much higher than the sum of the measured
   inorganic sulfate and the organic sulfur associated with the
   dinitrotoluene sulfonates initially present in the raw red water. This
   indicates the presence of other unidentified S-containing organic
   compounds in red water. The nitrogen analyses indicate a significant
   NH4+ concentration (32 mg N/1) in treated waste and a high N-2
   concentration (14.6\%; net increase of 4.6\%) in the off-gas. The
   toxicity results indicate that the WO-treated red water exerts toxic
   effects on Acinetobacter and Nitrosomonas growth, but has less impact on
   activated sludge. Furthermore, treated samples at 340 degrees C appear
   to exhibit a more inhibitory effect on both Acinetobacter and

Abstract = {{Crossflow microfiltration (CFMF) was used to filter liquor removed from
   the top of a laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic sludge-bed (UASB)
   reactor. Prior to filtration the COD removal was 91.7\%, with 1.0 g
   l(-1) of suspended solids at the top of the reactor. During 17 days of
   operation with filtration the suspended solids concentration was
   increased to 5.9 g l(-1). The maximum solids concentration at which the
   reactor could be operated was not reached. The effluent quality was high
   (0.050 g l(-1) suspended solids). The COD removal was increased to
   between 98 and 99\%. It is possible that returning liquor aerated the
   top zone of the reactor, promoting the growth of aerobic organisms on
   residual COD material. Alternatively the increased capacity could have
   been due to the biomass retention. The coupling of the UASB reactor to
   the CFMF unit led to an improvement in the effluent from the system,
   i.e. lower effluent suspended solids concentration and increased COD
   removal capacity due to aerobic polishing.}},

Abstract = {{Crossflow microfiltration (CFMF) was investigated as a substitute for
   secondary settling in the activated sludge process, to retain a greater
   biomass concentration in the reactor and increase the reactor chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) degrading capacity.
   The system was operated at six different steady-state conditions. Sludge
   age was varied between 5 and 20 days and chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   loadings ranged between 7.5 and 45.0 g l(-1). The reactor suspended
   solids concentration was increased from 0.95 to 19.47 g l(-1), over
   three times the secondary settling maximum of 6.0 g l(-1). Effluent
   quality was good with 0.013 g l(-1) suspended solids and COD removal
   above 97\%. With secondary settling. the effluent suspended solids
   concentration is commonly 0.020 g l(-1) although this figure increases
   as the maximum reactor solids concentration exceeds 6.0 g l(-1).
   For CFMF it was necessary to pump sludge under pressure through the
   filtration system. The pumping resulted in a particle size of 2 mu m, in
   comparison with flee sizes of 100 mu m in activated sludge systems
   operating with secondary settling. The size reduction had no deleterious
   effect on the reactor COD removal capacity. It was noticed, however,
   that it was not possible to settle the sludge particles.}},

   from the influent and readily biodegradable hydrolysis products, due to
   the different diffusional resistances. Most of the kinetic parameters of
   the heterotrophic floc-forming and the nitrifying microorganisms can
   directly be estimated from different batch-tests. Because obligate
   aerobic filamentous microorganisms only represent a small fraction of
   the biocenoses, their kinetic parameters cannot directly be measured,

Abstract = {{The AEROFIL model is verified by experiments in a full-scale and a
   pilot-scale plant and several model applications are demonstrated. It is
   shown that long hydraulic retention times in primary settling tanks tend
   to favour aerobic bulking. Even small amounts of obligate aerobic
   filamentous microorganisms in the influent, eroded from the slime layers
   in sewers, may provoke serious problems with the settling properties of
   the activated sludge. The design of aerobic selectors with 10 kg
   BOD5/m(3) d, as recommended by the ATV Task Group, generally leads to
   optimal selector volumes. The positive effect of compartmentalized
   aerobic selectors is demonstrated by the AEROFIL model. If anoxic
   selectors are designed with 2.5 kg BOD5/m(3) d, as recommended by the
   ATV Task Group, the growth of obligate aerobic filamentous
   microorganisms is successfully suppressed. Extended anoxic sludge
   blankets in secondary clarifiers hinder the obligate aerobic filamentous
   microorganisms in their competition against facultative aerobic
   floc-formers.}},

Abstract = {{Four experiments were performed to assess the role of homogeneous,
   heterogeneous, biological and photochemical processes in the oxygenation
   of ferrous iron in aquatic ecosystems. Experiments were carried out at
   Lake Cristallina, Ticino, Switzerland; and in the laboratory. Rate
   constants are presented for homogeneous oxygenation in lakewater, for
   oxygenation by lake sediment under sterile and non-sterile conditions
   and for heterogeneous oxygenation in the presence of TiO2, MnO2, Fe2O3,
   Al2O3 and SiO2. It was found that, on a surface area adjusted basis,
   TiO2, MnO2 and Fe2O3 were three orders of magnitude more effective in
   accelerating oxygenation than Al2O3 and SiO2, suggesting that these
   minerals form strong, inner sphere complexes with Fe(II) in the pH range
   4-6. Sterilization by gamma irradiation reduced oxygenation rate in the
   presence of lake sediment by two orders of magnitude on a surface area
   adjusted basis. Oxygenation in the presence of 0.44 mu m filtered
   lakewater was not appreciably different from that in distilled water. In
   situ experiments showed that oxygenation rate increased in the presence
   of sunlight. The heterogeneous rate constant for iron oxidation with
   lake sediment was 4.9 x 10(14) M(-1) atm(-1) s(-1) m(-2) and with pure
   minerals ranged from 1.8 x 10(10) to 5.3 x 10(13) M(-2) atm(-1) s(-1)
   m(-2).}},

Abstract = {{The status of fundamental models of the performance of deep bed filters
   is reviewed and a modified model for monodisperse suspensions is

   two linear approaches for headless modeling are also described. The
   sensitivity of model predictions to variations in parameter values is
   presented. A comparison with experimental results for ripening and
   steady state conditions shows that particle removal can be described
   well while the observed linear (with time) headless results cannot be
   described by modifications of the O'Melia and Ali approach. A surface
   area based linear headless model appears to capture the effects of
   suspended particle size on headless development while effects of
   coagulant type must be described by changes in model parameter values.}},

Title = {{INTERACTION BETWEEN SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA AND METHANE-PRODUCING
   BACTERIA IN UASB REACTORS FED WITH LOW STRENGTH WASTES CONTAINING

Abstract = {{The mutual interaction between sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and
   methane-producing bacteria (MPB) in anaerobic sludge consortia was
   investigated using three identical laboratory-scale UASB reactors.
   Reactors were fed in parallel with a synthetic low strength waste
   (starch and sucrose, 500 mg COD l(-1)), but with different levels of
   Sulfate (30, 150, 600 mg SO42- l(-1), respectively). The mass balances
   of COD and sulfur over the experimental period of 180 days operation
   indicated that the higher the level of sulfate the less methane
   production caused since a greater electron flow was distributed to the
   SRB. Namely, at the last stage of the experiment in which the highest
   sulfate level was imposed, 75\% of the total COD removal was performed
   by SRB. The specific methanogenic activities (SMAs) of the respective
   sludges were evaluated using the serum vial test using different
   substrates and by setting different sulfate levels. SMA was not affected
   by the presence of sulfate in the vials when acetate was used as the
   vial substrate. In the case of glucose as the test substrate, SMA
   increased with an increase in sulfate level. On the other hand, SMA
   decreased with increasing sulfate level when hydrogen was employed as
   the test substrate. A large amount of propionate accumulation was
   observed during vial tests, in which glucose was fed to the sludge grown
   at higher levels of sulfate, when zero or low levels of sulfate were
   added to the vials. This result suggests that SRB played an important
   role in the breakdown of propionate either through direct utilization or
   through a so-called interspecies hydrogen transfer.}},

   waste sludge in an aerobic-anoxic fashion. The control reactor `'fixed''
   the length of the aerobic-anoxic cycle at 6 h, with each segment of the
   cycle set at 3 h each. The experimental reactor used ORP to control the
   total length of the cycle based upon the distinctive `'nitrate
   breakpoint'' occurring in the ORP-time profile. The reactors were
   evaluated on the basis of removals for TSS, VSS, nitrogen and
   phosphorus. In addition, the control stability achieved when the
   reactors were subjected to spikes of specific chemicals was monitored.
   The ORP-regulated reactor better accommodated the disturbances, as well
   as appeared to show an increase in the removal of nitrogen and solids.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of environmental factors, depth and layer thickness of sediment,
   organic matter, reducing substance, oxygen concentration and
   temperature, on sediment oxygen demand(SOD) were examined by laboratory
   experiments. Apparent effects on the SOD rates were recognized from each
   factor, except for the layer thickness and organic matter content in
   sediment. The SOD rates varied with sediment depths, which was
   attributed to the reducing substances in sediments. Temperature (T)
   revealed the most marked effect among these factors, and SOD rates
   increased linearly with temperature in the range of 10-30 degrees C.
   Oxygen concentration in overlying water did not influence the SOD rate
   when it was over 2-3 mg/l, but influenced below this concentration.
   The SOD rates in Hiroshima Bay, measured by both an in situ chamber
   (bell jar) and a laboratory method with intact cores, agreed well with
   each other and ranged from 0.10 to 0.61 g O-2/m(2)/d, with a mean of
   0.3-0.4 g O-2/m(2)/d on an annual basis. The rates in summer and autumn
   were twice those in winter, It also became evident in this study that
   SOD rates in Hiroshima Bay were mainly controlled by biological
   consumptions from summer to autumn and by chemical consumption of the
   reducing substances during winter and spring.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of non-point pollution from agricultural land implies the
   knowledge of fluxes of pollutants, their origins and transfer mechanisms
   (CCE, 1974; Pluarg, 1978; CIPEL, 1985). To document the different
   processes involved, water quality of a small experimental watershed has
   been studied for 3 years.
   This basin (14 ha) is located in the catchment area of Lac Leman (Fig.
   1, Table 1). It stretches across glaciary deposits in an agricultural
   area with grasslands and cereals. It represents a sub-unit of a larger
   rural watershed (33 km(2)) which has also been monitored in a previous
   work (Pilleboue and Dorioz, 1986).
   The water from the experimental basin flows into 3 ha of wetland. The
   mean water discharge at the outlet is 61 s(-1), with a maximum of 1001
   s(-1) (Fig. 2,Table 2).
   The monitoring equipment used included: a rain gage, a limnigraph,
   automatic samplers, sediment traps (Fig. 1). Twenty storm flows have
   been monitored during the 3 years bf the survey. Samples were taken
   every 30 min and analyses were performed on 2 h cumulative samples.
   During low flow periods, a water sample was collected every week.
   Nutrient export coefficients measured (Table 3) were 14.6 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1) for N (22\% of inputs) and 0.6 kg ha(-1) year(-1) for P (1.7\%
   of inputs). One half of the total P was transferred as dissolved P and
   73\% of the total N, as nitrate. These annual mean values are relatively
   low compared to data previously found for large and intensively
   cultivated areas (CCE, 1974; Olness et al., 1975).
   The fluxes from the watershed were strongly variable (from 0.1 to 36 kg
   week(-1) for N and 0.005 to 0.3 kg week(-1) for P). P is transferred
   essentially during storm flows, while the N losses depended mostly upon
   the season (Fig. 2).
   The mean values characterizing the water of the experimental watershed
   are always below the agreed standard level for N but almost equal dr
   greater for dissolved P (Table 4). However the values are strongly
   related to the type of hydrological event (Table 6). Comparative study
   of the storm flows provided a good relationship between hydrological
   processes and variations in water quality: (1) Storm hows induced
   initially by a `'piston flow effect'' on the water table and followed by
   a limited run off. In this case losses were relatively small both for N
   (Fig. 4) and P (Fig. 3). Suspended matter and total phosphorus peaks
   coincide with the water peak and no lag effect was observed. (2) Storm
   flows with a significant runoff(Fig. 5). The peaks of suspended matter
   and phosphorus occurred at the very beginning of the storm flow and a
   lag effect appeared. Then, the total phosphorus concentration reached a
   very high level (up to 1 mg l(-1)) whereas nitrates remained at a very
   low level with sometimes a dilution effect during the water peak. (3)
   Storm flows with an important subsurface runoff (Fig. 6). P and N were
   essentially transferred in dissolved form. Extraction of N from soil was
   maximum and P was released in soluble form as several successive peaks.
   This phosphorus was transferred with the subsurface water flow (Fig. 7).}},

Abstract = {{Effects of anaerobic storage on physical, chemical and microbiological
   parameters in thickened activated sludge from a plant with biological N
   and P removal were examined. Short-term (0-1 day) as well as long-term
   (10-14 days) experiments were performed. The dewaterability of
   unconditioned sludge, measured as specific resistance to filtration
   (SRF), showed a steady decline and was strongly reduced after 10 days of
   anaerobic storage. An increase in turbidity in bulk water was observed
   and correlated well with the decreased dewaterability. Most of the
   turbidity could be explained by material not passing a 0.45 mu m filter.
   Presence of free bacteria was observed of which many were motile and
   came from the flocs. The flee size distribution for flocs larger than 10
   mu m did not change during the storage.
   A significant increase in the conductivity of the sludge was observed as
   a result-of a release of ions and other products from bacterial
   degradation processes. This increased conductivity coincided with an
   increased turbidity, and disintegration of the flocs was discussed in
   the context of the stability of the flocs under varying ionic strength.
   A more detailed study of the processes leading to the increased
   conductivity was performed. On a short term basis a bacterial release of
   ions (PO43-, Mg2+ and K+) from Poly-P bacteria took place. After a few
   hours of anaerobic storage no more PO43- was released but the levels of
   Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ were continuously observed to increase. Degradation of
   organic material was observed resulting in a production of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) and NH4+. The amount and the rate of ion release
   and mineralization were very constant during a year when expressed per
   amount of volatile solids.}},

Abstract = {{Bacterial regrowth potential in Southern California surface and
   groundwaters was evaluated for assimilable organic carbon (AOC)
   concentrations using two bioassays. Untreated and ozonated groundwaters
   were tested to determine variation in AOC with well site, season and
   static water depth. The mean total AOC concentration (Pseudomonas P17 +
   Spirillum NOX) for untreated groundwater was 54 mu g carbon (C) l(-1).
   Ozone treatment resulted in a 2 to 10-fold increase in AOC with an
   average concentration of 254 mu g Cl-1. Highly colored groundwaters
   (containing up to 250 platinum color units, pcu) were ozonated with 7 mg
   l(-1) which was sufficient to remove up to 75 pcu of color but often
   resulted in AOC concentrations exceeding 500 mu g Cl-1. In comparison,
   AOC levels in untreated surface waters were generally greater than 100
   mu g Cl-1 and showed less of an increase after ozonation than did
   groundwaters. Total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations ranged from 0.2
   to 5.7mg l(-1) and most groundwater samples contained less than 1 mg
   l(-1) TOC. There was no correlation between AOC and chemical parameters
   such as DOC, color or u.v. absorbance (254 nm). Ratios of AOC to DOC
   ranged from 0.5 to 31\% which suggests that the majority of the organic
   carbon in groundwater and surface waters is biologically stable. In
   summary, AOC levels appeared to vary with well location and possibly
   with season. Therefore, routine monitoring of source and treated water
   must be conducted on a site specific basis to determine bacterial
   regrowth potential or biofilm formation. Appropriate treatment
   strategies can then be developed, on an area by area basis, to remove or
   reduce AOC levels.}},

Title = {{URBAN WASTE-WATER TREATMENT BY TRICKLING FILTER AND ROTATING BIOLOGICAL
   REACTOR}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a comparison between the secondary treatment
   performances of two semi-industrial biofilm reactors: a 5.8 m(3)
   trickling filter and a 2 m(3) rotating biological contactor. Both
   reactors are packed with the same support media: waved plates of
   plasdek. Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of the units, their
   characteristics are given in Table 1. The pilots are fed with the
   primary urban wastewater of Tunis, and the water characteristics are
   given in Table 2.
   If the liquid hold-up V-L in the rotating contactor is independent of
   the hydraulic conditions (it is equal to the reactor volume), the liquid
   hold-up on the trickling filter is only dependent on the cross flow
   velocity U-m (Fig. 2). The hydraulic retention time tau is defined by
   the ratio V-L/Q, in the trickling filter it is a growing function of the
   recycle ratio R, and a decreasing function of the wastewater flow rate Q
   (Ferchichi, 1991).
   The unit oxygen capacity is measured with a clean packing or with a
   packing covered with the biofilm. The values are given in Table 3, they
   are similar to the results presented by Vasel and Schrobiltgen (1991).
   The oxygen capacity of the trickling filter is much greater than that of
   the rotating contractor. In fact, even the packing is the same, the
   liquid hold-up per unit packing area is much smaller in the trickling
   filter and the oxygen transfer is thus faster.
   The treatment efficiency is shown in Figs 3 and 5. Pollution removal is
   linked to the retention time tau, the efficiency being a growing
   function before reaching a step. A hydraulic residence time of less than
   15 min is sufficient for the trickling filter to reach about 65\% of
   soluble COD removal, 90\% of soluble BOD removal and 80\% of ammoniacal
   nitrogen removal. More than 3 h are necessary to obtain the same
   performances on the rotating contactor.
   Biofilm reactor models are generally established on reaction or
   diffusion limitation inside the biofilm (Arvin and Harremoes, 1989;
   Atkinson, 1974; Grasmick et al., 1979; La Motta, 1974; Vaughan et al.,
   1973; Williamson and McCarty, 1976). A very simple model {[}introduced
   by Rodrigues et al. (1983) and Elmaleh and Grasmick (1985)] allows very
   simple relations between the treatment efficiency E and the hydraulic
   retention time tau (Table 4). Only one parameter is utilized in this
   model, its analytical expression depends on the limiting regime: the
   reaction regime or the diffusion regime (Table 4). The model accuracy
   shows that organic removal is linked to the diffusion regime {[}Fig.
   4(a) and (b)] and ammoniacal removal is linked to the reaction regime
   {[}Figs 5(a) and (b)]. The calculated values of the parameter (Table 5)
   confirm the better performances of the trickling filter and allow easy
   design of the industrial units.}},

Abstract = {{Batch microcosms were utilized to evaluate binding of
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) to dissolved humic acid (HA). Biodegradation
   of 2,4,6-TCP was then evaluated after addition of a bacterial culture
   previously acclimated to the substrate. Gel chromatography (size
   exclusion) was used to separate HA-bound 2,4,6-TCP from free (unbound)
   2,4,6-TCP by molecular size before quantitative analysis. Dissolved HA
   can interact with free 2,4,6-TCP, forming an HA/TCP association in
   solution. Equilibrium isotherms of 2,4,6-TCP for dissolved HA are linear
   for 2,4,6-TCP concentrations up to 1000 mu g/l and HA concentrations up
   to 100 mg/l. Distribution coefficients of 2,4,6-TCP for HA vary with
   dissolved humic concentration. Coefficients decreased with increasing HA
   concentration indicating a change in HA sorption characteristics with
   concentration.
   Acclimated bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can mineralize up to 60\%
   of the total 2,4,6-TCP in solution, however, total mineralization
   decreased with increasing HA concentration. Overall mineralization in
   HA-containing solutions was 5-15\% less than in HA-free solutions.
   Biodegradation of free 2,4,6-TCP was very rapid while biodegradation of
   HA-bound 2,4,6-TCP was much reduced and appeared to be desorption
   controlled.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the impact of nutrient loading from a sewage treatment
   plant and from aquatic macrophytes on riverbed chemistry, a 6-month
   (May-November) study was undertaken in the South Saskatchewan River,
   Saskatchewan, Canada at five sites located upstream and downstream of a
   municipal sewage treatment plant outfall and with differing biomasses of
   aquatic macrophytes. Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the
   sediment-bound and porewater pools of the riverbed were greatest and
   porewater dissolved oxygen concentrations were lowest at the site with
   highest open-water nutrient concentrations (118 and 553 mu g/l TP and
   TDN) and aquatic macrophyte biomass (205 g/m(2)). Sites receiving little
   or no sewage effluent (23-60 mu g/l TP and 221-325 mu g/l TDN) had the
   lowest porewater and sediment-bound nutrient concentrations if no
   macrophytes were present, whereas concentrations were one-third to
   seven-fold greater if macrophytes were present in moderate abundance
   (135 g/m(2)). Our results showed that effluent loading and aquatic
   macrophytes may cause significant changes in the chemistry of riverbed
   sediments and suggest that for shallow slow-flowing rivers, benthic
   nutrient exchanges represent a critical component in water quality
   modeling.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of flotation thickeners for waste activated sludge in
   The Netherlands does not meet expectations; without the addition of
   chemical aids the dry solids content of the floated sludge is 3-4\%
   instead of the expected 4.5\%. An investigation into the improvement of
   the flotation thickening of waste activated sludge has been made.
   Experiments were carried out on the size and concentration of the
   produced air bubbles, both important parameters in the flotation
   process. Laboratory experiments showed that bubble size increased from
   50 to 100-150 mu m when a tube was placed behind the nozzle. These
   results indicated the need to check bubble formation at the full-scale
   thickener of the wastewater treatment plant at Zwolle, The Netherlands.
   However, the negative effects which occurred at laboratory-scale were
   not found in the full-scale experiments, which resulted in bubble sizes
   of 45-60 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{The overall performance of a two-phase anaerobic wastewater treatment
   system was determined as a function of the extent of recycle of the
   effluent from the methanogenic reactor to the acidification reactor. The
   system consisted of a well mixed continuous reactor as the acidification
   stage, which was controlled at pH 6 by automatic addition of caustic
   soda, and a fluidized sand bed reactor for the methanogenic stage, which
   was left uncontrolled. The results showed that the introduction of
   recycle could minimize the total operational costs of treatment due
   mainly to a considerable saving in alkali addition. The results
   confirmed earlier model predictions. The introduction of recycle
   acidified the methanogenic reactor, thereby removing dissolved carbon
   dioxide to the gas phase; this reduction in the concentration of weak
   acids was the principal cause of the decrease in the caustic
   consumption. The effects of the recycle rate on other operating
   variables such as effluent pH and COD, biomass loss and methane content
   of the exit gas were also assessed.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption behavior of atrazine in the presence of background
   organics present in river water has been evaluated by studying the
   adsorption on two kinds of solids: zeolites and organoclays. The most
   hydrophobic solids such as zeolite ZSM-5 and organoclays adsorb atrazine
   better when background organics are present on the solid.
   On more hydrophilic solids such as zeolite Y, the adsorbed amount of
   atrazine molecules is lower and the isotherm presents the same behavior
   as background organics: the adsorption isotherm exhibits a maximum. The
   origin of such behavior is due to: (i) very high affinity of atrazine
   for background organics which can play the role of `'hosts'' for
   pesticides and (ii) the evolution of the conformation of the background
   organic molecules along the isotherm. The conformation depends on the
   Ca2+/background organics ratio. At a high ratio, the molecules have a
   coil-like conformation known to be favorable for adsorption. At a low
   ratio, a rod-like conformation is the reason for the low adsorption
   level. The same behavior seems to occur when tannic acids are used for
   models of background organic. Polysaccharides like dextran do not
   exhibit such behavior.
   Taking into account the amount of background organic adsorbed, the
   relative affinity constants, K-oc of atrazine for zeolite ZSM-5 and
   organoclays have been calculated. K-oc is 550 on ZSM-5 and 3000 on
   organoclays. On this last solid, the affinity is 6 times larger than
   with ZSM-5.}},

Abstract = {{Catalase is a cellular enzyme produced during oxidative metabolism of
   aerobic living systems which degrades toxic hydrogen peroxide produced
   during oxidative metabolism in cells. Measurements of catalase permit
   the study of organic change and microbial density. The technique is used
   to measure the rate of self purification of two rivers and sets of
   stabilization ponds in India and activated:sludge plant and slurry tanks
   in Britain, Catalase surveys have been widely used to evaluate
   wastewater quality and results compare closely with those using long
   standing techniques to measure BOD and E. coli (Gaddad et al., 1982).
   Catalase is active between pH 4 and 10 and a temperature range which
   accommodates tropical and temperate circumstances. The test requires
   only minimal time to complete using simple reagents. Its full potential
   will be realized only:when comparative models relate results to standard
   procedures and electronic catalase meters become available.}},

Abstract = {{The RNAs extracted from 28 high spin pellets of clarified lysates from
   BGM cells, previously infected by concentrated Adriatic Sea water
   samples, were analyzed by a dot blot test. We used a P-32-labeled cDNA
   probe (BamHI220-670) from the 5' non-coding end of the cloned poliovirus
   1 (Mahoney) genome. The probe was selected for its broad range of
   genetic specificities.
   Based on the density of the hybridization signals on the autoradiograph,
   our dot blot results showed a high degree of reactivity of the probe to
   homologous (poliovirus 1) and heterologous (echovirus 6 and
   coxsackievirus B3) reference RNA, as predicted by a computer analysis of
   their sequences, and a low reactivity to that of the samples leading us
   to exclude the presence of enteroviruses like the reference strains. In
   order to understand if there were other enteroviral serotypes or not,
   dot blot tests were supplemented with Northern-blot hybridization
   assays. Results from the Northern-blot showed a series of fragments
   ranging from 4.3 to 1.2 kb but no signal corresponding to 7.5 kb (as did
   the positive control RNAs). These features suggested that the tested
   RNAs might derive from viruses of the Reoviridae family, which includes
   members with segmented genome. Traditional PAGE analysis showed clearly
   the 10-fragments pattern characteristic of reoviruse.
   Twenty-three out of the twenty-eight samples tested showed the presence
   of viruses, and this confirms the previously noted cytopathic effect
   (CPF) of the samples on the BGM cells.}},

   measurements are used to determine the limiting current density. A
   mathematical model taking into account the diffusion and migration of

   transfer coefficient. The range of the Sherwood numbers obtained with
   the present method were of the same order of magnitude as those obtained
   from classical mass transfer studies. The proposed method and the

Title = {{DIRECT TREATMENT OF DOMESTIC WASTE-WATER BY PERCOLATION OVER PEAT, BARK
   AND WOODCHIPS}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{17-26}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory columns were used to determine the treatment capacity of
   Sphagnum spp peat and Pinus spp bark and woodchips to treat primary
   (unsettled) domestic sewage by percolation. Bark and peat were found to
   be applicable materials, woodchips seemed inadequate because of poor
   COD(tot) removal and lack of disinfection. Matured percolator columns
   containing a layer of 50 cm bark packed at a density of 0.150 g/cm3 and
   supplied with 10 cm wastewater per day gave the following reductions:
   SS, 72\%; COD(tot), 63\%; BOD5, 97\%; NH4+-N, 64\%; and N(tot)-N, 35\%.
   The effluent had a pH of 7.5. The bark percolator had, however, a poor
   disinfecting capacity: faecal indicator organisms were reduced by only 1
   log unit.  The peat percolator (operated at 0.075 g/cm3 and 10 cm/d) had
   a good disinfecting capacity for faecal bacteria, reducing them by 3-4
   log units.  The effluent had a low pH (pH = 4.5) during the first 3
   months of operation. Once matured, the following average reductions were
   obtained: SS, 91\%; COD(tot), 50\%; BOD5, 99\%; NH4+-N, 93\% and
   N(tot)-N, 38\%. The treatment capacity was not significantly (alpha =
   0.05) affected by the applied densities of a percolator layer (0.075 and
   0. 100 g/cm3 for peat and woodchips; 0. 150 and 0. 1 75 g/cm3 for bark)
   and the hydraulic loading rates (2.5 or 10.0 cm/d). Combining two or
   three materials by mixing (equal volume) or by applying them in layers
   (equal layer thickness) gave similar effluent qualities, though
   percolators containing a layer of peat were more effective in the
   removal of faecal bacteria.  The temporary presence of a biocide in the
   wastewater and a prolonged period of drought (14 days) disturbed NO(x)-N
   formation but did not influence SS, COD(tot) and NH4+-N removal.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of retention time (RT) on reactor performance and
   bacterial trophic populations has been investigated by using a CSTR
   anaerobic digester fed with starch as the major organic carbon source.
   RT does not have much effect on the population levels of hydrolytic
   bacteria and H-2-producing acetogens. The population of hydrolytic
   bacteria remained at 10(8)-10(9)MPN/ml for RTs between 244.8 and 1.5 h,
   and the population of H-2-producing acetogens was 10(8)-10(11) MPN/ml
   when RT was longer than 3.12 h. However, RT has a considerable effect on
   the population levels of methanogens, homoacetogens as well as
   sulfate-reducing bacteria and on the composition of fermentative
   products. The populations of H-2-utilizing methanogens and homoacetogens
   increased when RT decreased from 244.8 to 6 h, and the maximum levels of
   these bacteria were 7.9 x 10(9) MPN/ml at a RT of 6 h and 3.5 x 10(10)
   MPN/ml at a RT of 12 h, respectively. In contrast, acetate-utilizing
   methanogens and CH3OH-utilizing methanogens were washed out at RTs of 12
   and 4.2 h, respectively. Even at a RT of 1. 5 h, methane was produced by
   H-2-utilizing methanogens in the acidogenic reactor. The best RT for
   phase separation is at a RT of approx. 12 h.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of copper is reduced due to complexation by ligands, e.g.
   humic acids or synthetic compounds like EDTA. Therefore, the
   concentration of free metal ions has been considered the main
   determinant of metal toxicity. This early hypothesis was tested by
   adding different concentrations of copper to water from the River Rhine
   and to a synthetic medium, supplemented with different concentrations of
   EDTA. Subsequently the following parameters were determined: (1)
   voltammetrically labile copper (differential pulse anodic stripping
   voltammetry), (2) fraction of copper retained on Chelex-100 columns, (3)
   photosynthetic rate of the alga Selenastrum capricornutum (in synthetic
   medium) and (4) rate of {[}H-3]thymidine incorporation by multiplying
   bacteria (in river water). Addition of 5 muM Cu to the medium with 5 or
   10 muM of EDTA inhibited algal photosynthesis, although copper was not
   voltammetrically detectable (<0.005 muM). Small spikes of copper
   (0.06-1.00 muM) added to river water inhibited the multiplication of
   bacteria; electrochemical determination showed no detectable copper
   activity at the lower concentrations. Chelex-retained copper correlated
   well with the percentage inhibition of the two biological activities.
   According to calculations using the model TITRATOR copper-EDTA complexes
   and un-ionized salts (mainly CuCO3) were dominant copper species in
   synthetic solutions inhibiting photosynthesis. The GECHEQ model
   calculated that free copper as well as chelex-labile copper correlated
   well with the inhibition of bacterial growth rate. Therefore it seems
   that complexed copper is `'biologically available'' to a significant
   extent. Furthermore, intermediate labile copper, such as chelex-retained
   copper, is an appropriate measure of copper toxicity.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of chlorine dioxide consumption by a wide range of
   inorganic and organic compounds, including a comprehensive series of
   phenols, have been determined using conventional batch-type and
   stopped-flow methods. In all cases, the rate law was first-order in
   chlorine dioxide and first-order in substrate. The methods allowed us to
   determine second-order rate constants over a range from 10(-5) to 10(5)
   M-1 s-1.  Measured rate constants were high for nitrite, hydrogen
   peroxide, ozone, iodide, iron (11), and, whenever the pH was not very
   low, for phenolic compounds, tertiary amines, and thiols. Bromide,
   ammonia, structures containing olefinic C=C double bonds, aromatic
   hydrocarbons, primary and secondary amines, aldehydes, ketones and
   carbohydrates were unreactive under conditions of water treatment. For
   substrates that are weak acids, such as phenols, or weak bases, the
   effect of pH on the reaction rate showed that the rate constants for the
   deprotonated compounds are much higher than those for the protonated
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorine dioxide (OClO) rapidly oxidizes substituted phenoxide anions in
   aqueous solution and second-order rate constants for this reaction have
   recently been reported for 25 compounds. Analysis of these data for
   correlations reveals several quantitative structure-activity
   relationships (QSARs) that can be used to predict rate constants for the
   reaction of additional phenolic compounds with chlorine dioxide. The
   rate constants for oxidation of phenoxide anions give good Hammett
   correlations to sigma- constants and Marcus correlations using half-wave
   oxidation potentials. Ortho- as well as meta- and para-substituted
   phenoxides have been included in both types of correlations and the only
   outliers are compounds that exhibit strong intramolecular hydrogen
   bonding. The results of the Marcus correlation analysis are consistent
   with the expected mechanism of reaction where the rate-limiting step is
   single electron-transfer from the phenoxide anion to chlorine dioxide.
   The second-order rate constants for oxidation of the undissociated forms
   of substituted phenols are about six orders of magnitude smaller than
   the corresponding values for phenoxide anions, indicating that only the
   reaction of phenoxide anions will be significant under the conditions of
   water treatment with chlorine dioxide. The rate constants for
   undissociated phenols also have much greater relative uncertainties than
   those for the phenoxide anions, and give much less satisfactory
   correlations.}},

Abstract = {{An objective index, the Sludge Biotic Index (SBI), based on the
   microfauna associated with activated-sludge mixed liquor, has been
   devised to monitor activated-sludge plant performance. The proposed
   method makes it possible to define the biological quality of the sludge
   using numerical values (biotic index) of 0-10, and to group SBI values
   into four quality classes. The method is based on two principles. First,
   the dominance of the microfauna keygroups changes in relation to the
   environmental and operational conditions of the plant. In particular,
   some protozoa such as small flagellates and the ciliates Vorticella
   microstoma and Opercularia spp have a negative influence on the index
   value. Secondly, the number of morphological species is reduced as the
   performance of the plant gets worse. The advantage of this method over
   other schemes is that it provides numerical values which enable the
   operator to monitor the prevalent plant operating conditions on a daily
   basis.}},

Abstract = {{Three insoluble enzymes (cellulase, phosphatase and urease) were found
   in the sediment phase of the Venice lagoon within an area of shallow
   water, the Palude della Rosa. Several washing treatments were performed
   to evaluate the binding forces between the enzymes and the solid phase.
   Urease was strongly bound and unaffected by all washing procedures
   tested, whereas phosphatase and part of the cellulase could be removed
   by phosphate anions. Cellulase activity was also solubilized by a
   non-ionic detergent. These immobilized enzymes showed marked heat
   stability and an increased resistance to environmental changes. They
   were probably of bacterial origin and could be advantageous for the
   removal of specific substances from water. They could be useful as
   diagnostic factors of the ecosystem, since their presence is related to
   the waste products and their lifespan is prolonged by their
   insolubilization.}},

Abstract = {{The toxicity of LAS on aquatic animals has been evaluated in particular
   relation to its concentration in water, although it is well known that
   sediments play an important role as repositories and sources of many
   contaminants, including surfactants. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the effects of sediment-sorbed LAS on the marine mussel Mytilus
   galloprovincialis exposed to sediments drugged with 132 mg/kg dry weight
   of LAS mixtures. Four experiments were performed and some physiological
   parameters (filtration, oxygen uptake, nitrogen excretion) were measured
   on control and treated animals. In order to study uptake and release of
   sediment-sorbed LAS by mussels, quantification of weight, percentage of
   organic matter, LAS concentration and LAS homologue distribution on
   faeces were determined. Results showed no significant differences in
   physiological responses of treated mussels compared to controls, and the
   absence of a toxic action of LAS contaminated sediments. Moreover one
   notable aspect was that higher LAS concentrations were found in faeces
   than in uningested sediments recovered from water. This fact is
   tentatively explained either as the result of decreased desorption in
   the mussel intestinal tract with respect to circulating water, or as
   enrichment in fine particles by mussel filter feeding activity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a complete sampling, fractionation and

   of gravitational sedimentation, cascade

   fractions were analyzed by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS),
   micro-electrophoresis (ME), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
   light scattering (LS), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission
   spectrometry (ICP-AES) and total organic carbon (TOC), which gave
   complementary results concerning the nature of the particles. The data
   indicated that submicron particles contribute only a small proportion of
   the total particle mass and volume, but an important proportion of the
   total particle number. Moreover, their specific surface area may be
   quite large. Associations of submicrometer particles with organic
   macromolecules and fibrils, which may have maintained such particles in
   suspension, were observed.}},

Abstract = {{The particle size distribution in the Rhine River near Basle
   (Switzerland) was measured for a period of over 1 year. Peaks in the
   measured size distributions were consistently observed in the ranges of
   100-200, 300-700 nm and 1-3 mum. The size distributions observed did not
   vary greatly with time or flow rate. Predictions of a classical
   coagulation/sedimentation model agreed well with these field
   observations. This agreement between model predictions and field
   measurements indicated that the unknown (and probably dynamic)
   `'initial'' particle distribution may have been quickly transformed,
   either in the river or in the interstitial soil solution, through
   coagulation and sedimentation into the characteristic and relatively
   stable shape experimentally observed.}},

Abstract = {{Guidelines for reuse and drinking water quality are based on scientific
   research and epidemiological findings, and as such provide guidance for
   making risk management decisions related to the protection of public
   health and the preservation of the environment. Water quality standards
   are legal impositions enacted by means of laws, regulations or technical
   procedures, which are established by countries by adapting guidelines to
   their national priorities and taking in account their technical,
   economical, social, cultural and political characteristics and
   constraints. Several examples are presented with the objective of
   differentiating standards from guidelines, and to show how countries
   have been adapting WHO guidelines to their situations in order to
   produce national standards on drinking water quality, and for the use of
   treated wastewater for crop irrigation.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{The variability of fine particulate organic matter concentrations in the
   streams of a moderately disturbed catchment were studied under different
   spatial and temporal scales. Spatial patterns of FPOM concentrations
   clearly reflect the effects of disturbances imposed by human settlements
   and land uses, and recovery processes. Temporal changes are mainly
   caused by floods which disrupt the spatial variability. These sources of
   variation may be responsible for the lack of a significant fit between
   discharge and FPOM concentrations in disturbed reaches. On a diel
   (throughout the day) scale, FPOM transport rhythms were clear only in
   undisturbed headwaters. Conventional sampling designs (e.g. annual
   cycles) should take into account short-term variability scales.
   The Aguera stream shows important internal processes (e.g.
   self-purification trends) that mitigate the influences of human
   settlements and tributaries, and can control FPOM transport under low
   flow conditions.
   Examination of different temporal and spatial scales seems to be
   necessary to detect the main factors that control FPOM transport in
   streams. This organic parameter could be important in evaluating the
   effects of intermediate disturbances in fluvial systems.}},

Abstract = {{A study of the cross microfiltration of immiscible organic solvent in
   water is reported using tridecanol as an example organic phase. The
   membranes used were of commercially available microporous, nylon,
   polysulphone and a mixed cellulose acetate/nitrate of pore sizes 1.2 mum
   and less. Good rejection of the dispersion was only achieved with
   membrane sizes of 0.45 and 0.2 mum and flux performance was affected by
   both concentration polarization and membrane fouling. Two procedures
   were attempted to eradicate the membrane fouling, surfactant cleaning of
   the membrane and coarse filtration of the dispersion to remove potential
   foulants. In the latter case this apparently removed a colloidal foulant
   present in the dispersion but also resulted in a near total loss of
   membrane rejection of the tridecanol. For the pore size membrane used
   (0.2 mum polysulphone) this foulant apparently imparts tridecanol
   rejection properties to the membrane. Surfactant cleaning/treatment of
   the membranes generally increased flux rates.}},

Abstract = {{The use of trace enrichment techniques with high performance liquid
   chromatography-conductometric detection is described for the
   determination of very low concentrations (down to ppb) of
   dihardenedtallowdimethyl ammonium compounds (DHTDMAC), major cationic
   surfactants, in a range of environmental matrices. The applicability of
   the procedure to the analysis of DHTDMAC in sludges, sediments, soil and
   aqueous environmental samples has been demonstrated during the course of
   interlaboratory exercises.  The HPLC procedure gives accurate and
   reproducible results (i.e. within laboratory standard deviations
   typically less-than-or-equal-to 7\%) for environmental samples and high
   recoveries of standard additions, generally greater-than-or-equal-to
   90\%, from all matrices. The detection limits of the procedure for
   environmental liquor and solid samples are estimated to be 2.5 mug/l and
   0.5 mug/g, respectively. Its high specificity for the determination of
   DHTDMAC in a range of environmental samples is shown by comparing the
   results obtained with those for a standard non-specific colorimetric
   disulphine blue method. The procedure as detailed is suitable for
   DHTDMAC but could be adapted for determining other cationic surfactants.}},

   cause hydrolysis of pyrophosphate, polyphosphate or the organic

   phase of sludge directly by extraction was modified so as to take into
   account the orthophosphate in the liquid phase remaining with the
   deposited solid phase. Values for orthophosphate in sludges from
   laboratory-scale and full-scale wastewater-treatment systems were not
   appreciably different when determined directly by extraction of the

Abstract = {{The pH of Tam Head Beck, an acidic upland stream in the English Lake
   District, was continuously recorded for a period of 6 months.
   Preliminary measurements showed that electrodes should be completely
   immersed to avoid problems associated with the difference in temperature
   between water and air. For a site without mains power good results were
   obtained by deploying electrodes within the stream in purpose-built
   units. There was good agreement between these directly deployed
   electrodes and electrodes immersed in an auxiliary flow in an instrument
   box on the bank of the stream. Spot measurements taken from the
   continuous record also compared well with dip samples collected into
   bottles and subsequently measured in the laboratory. There were no
   problems associated with long-term drift under field conditions, even
   though preliminary laboratory experiments had indicated that the
   stability of the electrodes would be inadequate. Electrodes appear to
   perform more reproducibly after long-term immersion in a relatively
   constant medium.
   Measurements of hydrogen ion fluxes over 14 day periods obtained using
   an automatic integrating sampler and the total flow were compared with
   measurements calculated from continuously recorded pH and flow. Although
   agreement was good at low and medium flow, the integrating sampler
   results appeared to underestimate results at high flow. For annual
   budget studies, the use of event triggered samplers is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Stabilization reservoirs are used for the seasonal storage and treatment
   of wastewater for irrigation. These reservoirs are not steady-state flow
   reactors, but rather accumulative batch ones with a relatively abrupt
   discharge. A new parameter, the percentage of fresh effluents within the
   reservoir (PFE) is proposed as a tool to analyze the age distribution of
   effluents in this kind of reactor. The equations to calculate the mean
   residence time (MRT) and the surface organic loading are also provided.
   The relatively small fraction of fresh effluents represented by PFE and
   not the whole age distribution of the effluents (MRT) determines the
   removal percentages of COD and BOD in the reservoir and the quality of
   the effluents released for irrigation. The effect of environmental
   parameters such as water temperature and solar radiation are overridden
   by the operational parameters (PFE). In steady-state flow reactors MRT
   can substitute PFE to evaluate the reactor performance because the ratio
   PFE/MRT is constant in this particular case. A value of 30-40 kg
   BOD/ha/day is recommended as the maximum allowable surface organic
   loading of stabilization reservoirs. The seasonal storage of wastewater
   in reservoirs reduces BOD, COD, TSS and detergents by 50-80\%, and total
   coliforms by 90\%, in terms of annual means. The quality of the
   effluents is maximal at the beginning of the irrigation season when the
   reservoir is full of old effluents, but sharply deteriorates when water
   level drops and new wastewater is pumped into the reservoir. Design and
   operational alternatives to overcome this problem can assure removals of
   at least 1 order of magnitude for chemical components, and of at least
   3-4 orders of magnitude for total coliforms. These alternatives are
   based on a change from seasonal to multi-seasonal storage of wastewater,
   and/or a change from single reservoir to two or more reservoirs
   supplying effluents of different quality.}},

Year = {{1994}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{An international workshop held at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles (4-6
   Sept. 1991) on the `'origin, occurrence and behaviour of sediments in
   sewer systems'' has shown that much progress has been made in the last 5
   years in the general understanding of sewer sediments. Comprehensive
   research programmes, including field surveys, have indicated that solids
   found in sewers, either in suspension or in deposition, cannot be
   considered as having a unique entity. On the basis of sewerage and
   sources, a categorization can be made between three broad types of
   solids: sewer grits, sanitary solids and (runoff-generated) fine
   material. Although some other categorizations are also possible, it is
   apparent that each of these three types has very specific
   physico-chemical characteristics and this has important implications
   both from the environmental and the operational points of view. The
   diversity of the types of sewer solids is not infinite (from place to
   place, sediments will differ only within relatively narrow bands),
   nonetheless the differences are the main reason why the development of a
   `'universal'' sewer sediment transport model is a remote prospect. For
   some elementary processes, such as the movement of non-cohesive grit in
   drainage conduits, detailed engineering solutions are beginning to
   emerge. It is also apparent that bed shear stress is a more appropriate
   parameter than flow velocity for defining erosive or depositional
   criteria in sewers. There is no doubt that in the future, the various
   problems of sewer sediments, washout of pollutants during storm
   overflows, reduction of hydraulic capacity, recurrent costs for cleaning
   sewerage lines and tanks, will have to be considered intrinsically in
   all urban drainage applications (design and analysis). It is also likely
   that wastewater treatment technology (and terminology) will intrude more
   and more in the apparent unchanging traditions of sewer network
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of chloroisocyanurates in swimming pool disinfection has
   been demonstrated by a number of authors (Andersen, 1965; Kolwalski and
   Hilton, 1966; Robinton and Mood, 1967; Fitzgerald and der Vartanian,
   1969). The disinfection rate was seen to slow down during studies on
   different bacteria; this was attributed to the existence of a weak
   concentration of free chlorine (HOCl + ClO-). However, since these
   studies were carried out when the aqueous chemistry of
   chloroisocyanurates was not completely elucidated, the specific action
   of chloroisocyanurates was difficult to determine. This, in part, was
   due to the large number and variety of experimental procedures and
   analytical methods for chlorine measurements, and to the lack of
   specificity of the methods employed.
   We studied the action of chloroisocyanumtes on three environmental
   strains: S. faecalis, S. aureus, Ps. aeruginosa and on one collection
   strain: Ps. aeruginosa-CIP. Disinfection tests were carried out in the
   laboratory, in pH and temperature conditions typically found in swimming
   pools (pH 7.5, 25-degrees-C). The initial concentration of total
   chlorine varies from 0.5 to 2.5 mg l-1, for concentrations of
   isocyanuric acid, H3Cy, from 25 to 360 mg l-1. With these
   concentrations, free chlorine (HOCl + ClO-) does not exceed 3\% of total
   chlorine (that is, less than 0.08 mg l-1). We used an easy and rapid
   method of dosage which distinguishes between `'available chlorine''
   {[}(HOCl + ClO-) + (chlorine from isocyanurates, H(n)Cl(m)Cy(p-))] and
   `'total chlorine'': absorption spectrophotometry after reaction with the
   N-diethylparaphenylenediamine (DPD). We adopted a common method for
   monitoring simultaneously, chlorine concentration and bacterial count.
   In this way, we studied the kinetics of selected bacteria inactivation,
   relative to H3Cy concentration and for different levels of available
   chlorine.}},

   BIOACCUMULATION IN YOUNG OYSTERS (CRASSOSTREA-GIGAS THUNBERG) DURING
   THEIR SPAT REARING}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Metal bioaccumulation in bivalves may occur as a
   consequence of the ingestion of inert or living particles which have
   bound trace elements. The best experiments, such as those carried out by
   Borchardt (1983, 1985) about Cd in mussels, have shown that suspended
   matter is only a small part of the source of contamination in molluscs.
   But whatever the reliability of the experimental methodologies,
   laboratory conditions never perfectly mimic natural phenomena. Thus, we
   have planned to restart these works using a large-scale experiment, the
   procedure of which was characterized by a small number of controlled
   parameters with a high degree of representativeness of reality.
   During experimental nursing of young oysters, we have assessed the
   influence of different controlled quantities of phytoplankton and of
   various experimental population densities on metal transfer from their
   environment to molluscs. Materials and methods Oysters (Crassostrea
   gigas) were distributed in several cylindrical containers the bottoms of
   which consisted of a sieve. Food and seawater were renewed continuously
   by means of an ascending current (Baud and Bacher, 1990). Nursing assays
   were carried out during summer over a 74 day period or during winter
   over a 91 day period. Twelve groups of oysters were set up according to
   food supply (0, 1x, 2x and 4x of Skeletonema costatum grown on
   underground salt-water in addition to natural phytoplankton) and
   population density (25,000 or 50,000 individuals per experimental
   container) (Table 1). Young molluscs were fed according to an
   alternating cycle of 3 h-feeding periods and 2 h-periods without food.
   The mean concentrations of pigment cells in the rearing seawater of the
   molluscs were 0, 10, 20 and 40 mug/l. This seawater was renewed at a
   flow rate of 3 m3/h during the summer experiment and 1 or 3 m3/h during
   winter.
   At the end of the nursing period, molluscs exposed to different
   experimental conditions were separated using sieves with different
   mesh-sizes (6, 8, 10, 14 and 18 mm; Table 2). Young oysters were purged
   for 36 h with a view to limiting the overvaluation of bioaccumulated
   metal levels due to ingested material (Amiard-Triquet et al., 1984;
   Kennedy, 1986). In each experimental and age-related category, 90
   individuals were sampled and divided into 3 groups of 30 specimens.
   In these groups, soft tissues were separated from the shells and
   oven-dried at 80-degrees-C for 48 h. The dry samples were powdered and
   three aliquots of about 1 00 mg each were digested with 1 ml of
   concentrated nitric acid (HNO3, Suprapur) at 95-degrees-C for 1 h. Then
   trace element analyses were performed in this solution diluted with
   deionized water by flame (Zn) or flameless (Cd, Cu, Pb) atomic
   absorption spectrophotometry using the Zeeman effect (Amiard et al.,
   1987).
   The influence of food supplies, flow rate and experimental population
   density on the dry weight of the soft tissues of young oysters, their
   metal concentrations and body burdens were examined using multi-linear
   regression analysis (Tomassone et al., 1983; Dagnelie, 1973). Results
   and discussion In Table 3 the metal concentrations in the seawater
   {[}Table 3(a)], phytoplankton and seston {[}Table 3(b)] are shown.
   In summer, the average weight and metal (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) burden in the
   soft tissues of the oysters increased with the quantity of food
   available and the size of the individuals, whereas it decreased
   concomitantly with increasing density of the experimental population of
   oysters (Table 4). The individual weights increased with increasing food
   supply (Fig. 2). The increase of food quantity and of the size of the
   oysters was concomitant with enhancement of the weight of their soft
   tissues and a decrease of metal concentrations (Table 5). In winter, the
   population density was correlated negatively with the weight of soft
   tissues but not with metal concentrations or burdens (Table 6).
   In summer, the experimental population density was correlated with Cu
   concentration {[}Table 7 and Fig. 5(B)] but not with Cd, Pb or Zn
   concentrations {[}Fig. 5(A) and (B)].
   The oyster size was correlated negatively with Cd and Pb concentrations
   during summer {[}Figs 3 and 5(B)] and with Cu and Zn concentrations
   during winter (Fig. 2 and Table 8).
   The influence of season was clearly established (Fig. 4): in summer, dry
   weights were two times higher than in winter and Cd, Cu and Zn
   concentrations and body burdens were more elevated in winter whereas the
   opposite pattern was shown for Pb.
   The influences of food supply, population density and individual size on
   the animal's weight, metal concentrations and corresponding body burdens
   are summed up in Table 9 for both the studied seasons. Conclusion
   Increased food supplies induce a biological dilution of Cd and Pb in
   young oysters. These results are in agreement with previous data about
   Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in different species (Mackay et al., 1975; Boyden,
   1974; Phelps and Hetzel, 1987; Berthet, 1986). Thus from the sanitary
   point of view, the use of underground seawater for algal culture is not
   at risk since metal concentrations in molluscs are not enhanced.}},

Abstract = {{Four methods for drying oyster soft tissues were compared: oven-drying
   at 105, 100 and 80-degrees-C and freeze-drying. Weights were recorded
   every 12 h for 5 days, and after sample treatments were switched, every
   24 h for another 3 days. The time required for all the oysters in a
   treatment to reach constant weight was 36, 36 and 60 h for 105, 100,
   80-degrees-C over-dried treatments and 120 h for the freeze-dried
   treatment. Within a treatment, the time required to reach constant
   weight was not weight-related. The average ratio of wet to 5-day dry
   weight ranged from 9.07 to 9.47 for oven-drying but was only 7.35 for
   freeze-drying. After 3 additional days at 105-degrees-C, the 105, 100,
   80-degrees-C oven-dried and freeze-dried groups lost an additional < 1,
   1, 1 and 8\% of their mean weights, respectively. All oven-dried groups
   pined 1\% over the 5-day weight in the freeze drier, while the
   freeze-dried group lost an additional 2\% in 3 days. The temperature for
   oven-drying, at least between 80 and 105-degrees-C, affected final dry
   weights by 1\% or less, but the drying times required to achieve
   constant weight were different. Freeze-drying required more time than
   oven-drying. Oven-drying should be continued to constant weight whatever
   the drying temperature employed and however long that takes.}},
