Abstract = {{A number of studies on deviant flavors of marine fish and crustaceans
   lire discussed to show the main causes of such impairments. Cases
   include fish caught in marine, coastal and freshwater environments or
   exposed to industrial effluents and oil spills. Regulations and testing
   procedures for the evaluation of chemicals capable of inducing foreign
   flavor or odor are described. Tainting of seafood caused by industrial
   chemicals has been observed after groundings of seagoing tankers. For
   cases other than those of long-term or accidentally large volume
   discharges, ``natural{''} reasons could be established for flavor
   impairments. There have been no reports of discharges from tank washings
   in the open ocean spoiling the flavor of seafood. Reports from
   production platforms show chemical contamination, in most cases,
   however, not associated with any impairment of fish flavor. In the
   regulations for marine transport, the tainting risk seems to have been
   overestimated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrification of simulated secondary effluent solution using a variant
   of the vertical flow bed constructed wetland was studied. In this system
   oxygen required for the nitrification process is supplied by a passive
   air pump. The passive air pump is based on a fill and draw cycle, where
   oxygen depleted air is removed from the system while fresh air is
   introduced. Each volume of effluent drained is displaced by an equal
   volume of fresh air. Spatial and temporal oxygen distribution in the
   system as a function of drained effluent volume was investigated.
   Experimental results of nitrification and the corresponding oxygen
   consumption show good agreement with theoretical calculations based on
   physicochemical considerations. Observations show that while oxygen
   distribution within the media was found to be non-uniform at the
   beginning of each cycle, it approached more uniform distribution with
   time. The latter resulted mainly from diffusion of oxygen in the gaseous
   phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Viable Escherichia coli cells were entrapped in agar gel layers to form
   artificial biofilms. Sessile-like bacteria and planktonic (suspended)
   counterparts were exposed for 28 d to natural (spring)-water at two
   temperatures (4 degrees C and 18 degrees C). Culturabilities on
   non-selective and selective solid media were monitored over the exposure
   period, together with cell viability that was determined by using a
   fluorescent viability probe and confocal scanning laser microscopy
   analysis. The number of planktonic organisms recovered on non-selective
   medium decreased by 3 logarithmic units during exposure at 4 degrees C
   and was reduced to an undetectable level at 18 degrees C. Whatever the
   temperature of the spring water microcosm, however, the immobilized-cell
   population did not decrease by more than one log unit over the exposure
   period. Cell counts on coliform-selective, lactose-deoxycholate agar
   plates confirmed the enhanced resistance of gel-entrapped cells to
   environment stress as compared to planktonic organisms: at the two
   tested temperatures, sublethal injury of suspended E. coli reached more
   than 80\% whereas it did not exceed 65\% for immobilized cells.
   Viability studies indicated that planktonic cells rapidly died. These
   results show that the ability of microorganisms to colonize aquatic
   ecosystems in the fixed state (i.e. as biofilms) must be considered in
   studies evaluating cell survival in these environments. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate the effects of
   interference parameters on the performance of nanofiltration for removal
   of trihalomethane precursors (THMPs). The influence of operating
   pressure, feed THMPs concentration, pH, presence of other ions (Ca2+ and
   Mg2+), and suspended solids on nanofiltration performance are
   determined. The effect of membrane precompaction is studied as well.
   Membrane performance for reversible and irreversible compaction is
   compared. Pretreated surface water from a pond is used as the feed water
   in the study to simulate the practical conditions in water treatment
   industries. Experimental results show that precompacted membrane has a
   higher rejection capacity.;Higher pressure, feed THMP concentration, and
   suspended solids increase rejection. However, overall flux variation due
   to these parameters is found to be negligible. On the other hand
   presence of divalent ions reduce the rejection capacity. Generally
   rejection is found to be greater than 90\% for a precompacted membrane,
   which turned out to be well suited for industrial scale application of
   nanofiltration for removal of THMPs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Nutrient limited growth of the phytoplankton assemblage in two Texas
   reservoirs was studied by a combination of nutrient addition experiments
   and statistical modeling. Dilution bioassays were run to ascertain-the
   qualitative and quantitative patterns in nutrient limitation. Algal
   growth was frequently and strongly nutrient limited, particularly when
   temperature was >22 degrees C. By itself, N was more often stimulatory
   than P, though strong additional enhancement of growth by P and trace
   nutrients was often detected. Monod growth kinetics indicated that
   half-saturation constants for N limited growth for the entire algal
   assemblage were in the range 20-200 mu g N/L, relatively high compared
   to literature values, and increased with increasing temperature. Maximal
   growth was also an increasing function of temperature. A single
   temperature-dependent model was fit to the growth dynamics for all
   experiments showing N-limitation. The model mu = 0.0256.T({[}DIN]/66.0 +
   {[}DIN]) where mu is specific growth rate (d(-1)), T is temperature
   (degrees C) and {[}DIN] is dissolved inorganic N (mu mol/L) fit the
   experimental results reasonably well (r(2) = 0.82). However, only a
   modest predictive power for growth in the controls (our best estimate of
   growth in situ) was achieved (r(2) = 0.26). Thus, even with unusually
   detailed, site-specific fitting of model parameters, accurately modeling
   algal growth in natural ecosystems can remain a challenge. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The microorganisms and compounds causing musty odor in the second
   largest lake in Japan, Lake Kasumigaura, where the water is used for
   drinking, fisheries and agricultural purposes, were examined during the
   severe occurrence of musty odor in 1989 and 1990. This study was
   undertaken to determine the microorganisms and their metabolites
   responsible for the musty odor. Phormidium tenue, which has been
   reported to be the main contributor of the odor in Lake Kasumigaura, was
   isolated. Furthermore, four monoxenic strains of the odor producing
   attached cyanobacteria, Phormidium viscosum, Lyngbya allorgei,
   Oscillatoria splendida and Phormidium uncinatum, were isolated from
   submerged rocks and sediments in the lake. All of the four attached
   strains produced only geosmin, which was confirmed by gas
   chromatograph/mass spectrometer analysis, in the monoxenic cultures. In
   particular, we confirmed for the first time that P. viscosum, L.
   allorgei and P. uncinatum produced geosmin. Both the planktonic
   Phormidium tenue, a well known 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) producer and
   geosmin-producing attached cyanobacteria were closely associated with
   the occurrence of musty odor in Lake Kasumigaura. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Fifteen milk processing plants in the Upper Midwest of the United States
   participated in a study to obtain information on general process
   operation, waste generation and treatment practices, chemical usage, and
   wastewater characteristics. Long term data on wastewater characteristics
   were obtained for 8 of the 15 dairy plants, and a 24-h composite
   wastewater sample was characterized in detail for each plant. Wastewater
   flow rates and characteristics varied greatly among and within plants
   and were not easily predictable even when detailed information on
   processing operations was available. In addition, the contribution of
   milk and milk products to the waste streams was underestimated by plant
   operators. The use of caustic soda, phosphoric acid, and nitric acid for
   cleaning had a significant impact on wastewater characteristics, despite
   the implementation of changes in chemical usage practices during recent
   years. In particular, the use of phosphoric acid based cleaning products
   has been reduced to eliminate or decrease discharge fines. It was
   determined that most of the on site treatment facilities require
   renovations and/or operational changes to comply with current and future
   discharge regulations, especially with respect to nutrient (nitrogen and
   phosphorus) levels in their waste streams. It was concluded that
   biological nutrient removal of dairy wastewaters should be feasible
   given the relatively high concentrations of easily degradable organics,
   the generally favorable organic matter to total phosphorus ratio, and
   the very favorable organic matter to nitrogen ratio. (C) 1998 Published

Abstract = {{The impact of a combined sewer overflow (CSO) upon receiving waters has
   been studied in the river Seine during Summers 1995 and 1996. Three main
   events have been monitored with special attention paid to the
   computation of oxygen, carbon and suspended solids budgets. Bacterial
   biomass and bacterial production rates have been measured to provide a
   more accurate understanding of the carbon cycle of the river Seine.
   Oxygen consumption inside the polluted water masses was totally due to
   the activity of large bacteria discharged into the river by the CSO, the
   activity of native small bacteria did not significantly increase after
   CSOs. Suspended solids issued from the CSO very quickly settles in this
   deep, slowly flowing river. However, discharged dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) cannot account for the observed oxygen depletions, the additional
   carbon source could be phytoplankton or deflocculated/degraded
   particulate organic matter. (C) 1988 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{22 Physico-chemical variables have been analyzed in water samples
   collected every three months for two and a half years from three
   sampling stations located along a section of 25 km of a river affected
   by man-made and seasonal influences. Exploratory analysis of
   experimental data have been carried out by box plots, ANOVA, display
   methods (principal component analysis) and unsupervised pattern
   recognition (cluster analysis) in an attempt to discriminate sources of
   variation of water quality. PCA has allowed the identification of a
   reduced number of ``latent{''} factors with a hydrochemical meaning:
   mineral contents, man-made pollution and water temperature. Spatial
   (pollution from anthropogenic origin) and temporal (seasonal and
   climatic) sources of variation affecting quality and hydrochemistry of
   river water have been differentiated and assigned to polluting sources.
   An ANOVA of the rotated principal components has demonstrated that (i)
   mineral contents are seasonal and climate dependent, thus pointing to a
   natural origin for this polluting form and (ii) pollution by organic
   matter and nutrients originates from anthropogenic sources, mainly as
   municipal wastewater. The application of PCA and cluster analysis has
   achieved a meaningful classification of river water samples based on
   seasonal and spatial criteria. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In down-flow fluidization, particles with a specific density smaller
   than the liquid are fluidized downward by a concurrent flow of liquid.
   This paper describes the application of the down-flow (or inverse)
   fluidization technology for the anaerobic digestion of red wine
   distillery wastewater. The carrier employed was ground perlite, an
   expanded volcanic rock. Before starting-up the reactor, physical and
   fluidization properties of the carrier material were determined. 0.968
   mm perlite particles were found to have a specific density of 280 kg
   m(-3) and a minimum fluidization velocity of 2.3 m h(-1). Once the
   down-flow anaerobic fluidized bed system reached the steady-state,
   organic load was increased stepwise by reducing HRT, from 3.3-1.3 days,
   while maintaining constant the feed TOC concentration. The system
   achieved 85\% TOC removal, at an organic loading rate of 4.5 kg TOC m(3)
   d(-1). It was found that the main advantages of this system are: low
   energy requirement, because of the low fluidization velocities required;
   there is no need of a settling device, because solids accumulate at the
   bottom of the reactor so they can be easily drawn out, and particles
   with high-biomass content, whose specific density have become larger
   than 1000 kg m(-3) can be easily recovered. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Removal of PCNB from aqueous solutions by fungal mycelia was studied.
   Adsorption of the fungicide by dead biomass of M. racemosus, R. arrhizus
   and S. cyanescens was determined and compared with sorption on isolated
   cell walls of these three strains. Biosorptive uptake capacities are
   described by Freundlich equations of the form Q(e) = K-f . C-e(nr).
   Measured values of K-f and n(f) indicate significant differences in the
   curve shapes and sorption capacities between the three species. Better
   performances were revealed by M. racemosus and R. arrhizus. Sorption of
   PCNB by cell walls alone was lower and statistically different from
   sorption by heat-killed mycelia thus corroborating that biosorption
   involved both uptake by the cell walls and by other cellular components.

Abstract = {{The solubility constant for struvite (MgNH4PO4. 6H(2)O) was measured in
   formation and;dissolution equilibrium experiments. The proposed
   solubility constant (pK(SO) = 13.26) accurately predicted struvite
   precipitation in sludge handling facilities at the Sacramento Regional
   Wastewater Treatment Plant, whereas the solubility constant in common
   use did not. An improved method was developed for predicting struvite
   precipitation potential in anaerobic digestion and post-digestion
   processes. Method improvements include consideration of ionic strength
   effects on ion activities, magnesium phosphate complexation effects on
   ion speciation, and an experimentally derived struvite solubility
   constant. The improved method accurately predicted struvite to be less
   soluble than predicted by earlier methods. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{This paper presents an HPLC method allowing the quantification of EDTA
   speciation, specifically the Fe(III)EDTA species, which is the only one
   considered to undergo significant degradation in the environment via
   photoreduction. The method relies on the exchange kinetics of metals
   with EDTA. Preliminary results were obtained by applying the method to
   the study of sewage treatment plants. We measured the evolution of the
   total EDTA concentration during,the sewage treatment, together with the
   changes of EDTA speciation following the process. Special attention is
   given to the quantitative importance of the Fe(III)EDTA species. (C)

Abstract = {{A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CELISA), based on
   polyclonal antibodies, was developed to measure
   benzyldimethyldodecylammonium chloride (BDD(12)AC), a component of
   benzalkonium chloride (BAK). The polyclonal antibodies recognized free
   benzyldimethyldodecylammonium bromide (BDD(12)AB) in an indirect
   competitive ELISA with a 50\% inhibition (IC50) of 0.66 +/- 0.20 mu g/ml
   and a detection limit of 0.043 +/- 0.033 mu g/ml. The two other
   components of BAK, benzyldimethyltetradecylammonium chloride (BDT(14)AC)
   and benzyldimethylhexadecylammonium chloride (BDH(16)AC), were
   recognized to varying degrees by the antibodies. The antibodies did not
   cross-react with other compounds such as fatty acids and alcohols, amino
   acids, amines, and short-chain quaternary ammonium compounds.
   Cross-reactivity was observed with other alkyldimethylbenzylammonium
   compounds (ADBACs). The CELISA and HPLC were used to measure the amount
   of pure BDD(12)AB spikes in milk and BDD(12)AC in five commercial
   products. HPLC analysis correlated well with CELISA analysis for spiked
   samples. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The limiting current technique and a mobile microelectrode were used to
   measure local flow velocity in biofilms. The microelectrode was
   calibrated using the particle tracking technique in conjunction with
   confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). A relationship between the
   limiting current density and the local flow velocity was found using
   nonlinear regression. This relationship was the same whether biofilm was
   present or not. Therefore, we used the measurements of limiting current
   density to evaluate flow velocity distribution around biofilm clusters.
   The flow velocity distribution was affected by the geometry of
   interstitial voids and by their orientation with respect to the how
   direction in the main conduit. Flow velocity measurements using the
   limiting current technique were faster than similar measurements using
   particle tracking with confocal scanning laser microscopy. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The effect of effluent composition involving the common anionic species
   Cl-, SO42- and CO32- on the efficiency of nickel(II) precipitation,
   modelling lime (CaO) as the precipitant, has been investigated using the
   solubility domain approach. Solubility domains were based on the phases
   that were found to limit metal solubility for systems representing
   potential effluent composition limits. These phases were found to
   resemble their mineralized counterparts, but with a lower degree of
   structural order. At higher SO42- and CO32- concentrations both gypsum
   (CaSO4. 2H(2)O) and calcite (CaCO3) were formed, but these had little
   effect on the observed residual nickel solubility. The calculated
   solubility domains were found to generally encompass the experimentally
   determined solubilities, thereby providing quality assurance ranges for
   hydroxide precipitation. The effect of the complexing anions tartrate
   and EDTA(4-) on residual Ni(II) in solution as well as the effects of
   the addition of Fe(III) on the removal of Ni(II) complexed by these
   species are described. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The relative importance of Lemna gibba L., bacteria and algae for the
   nitrogen and phosphorus removal in duckweed-covered domestic wastewater}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3651-3661}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To arrive at detailed nutrient balances for duckweed-covered wastewater
   treatment systems, five laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in
   shallow (3.3 cm), 11 batch systems to assess separately the
   contributions of duckweed itself, attached and suspended bacteria as
   well as algae to N- and P-removal in domestic wastewater. Depending on
   the initial concentrations, our duckweed-covered systems removed 120-590
   mg N m(-2) d(-1) (73-97\% of the initial Kjeldahl-nitrogen) and 14-74 mg
   P m(-2) d(-1) (63-99\% of the initial total phosphorus) in 3 days.
   Duckweed (Lemna gibba L.) itself was directly responsible for 30-47\% of
   the total N-loss by uptake of ammonium and, probably dependent on the
   initial P-concentrations, for up to 52\% of the total P-loss. The
   indirect contribution of duckweed to the total nutrient removal was also
   considerable and included the uptake (and adsorption) of ammonium and
   ortho-phosphate by algae and bacteria in the attached biofilm and the
   removal of N through nitrification/denitrification by bacteria attached
   to the duckweed. Together these accounted for 35-46 and 31-71\% of the
   total N- and P-loss, respectively. Therefore, approximately 3/4 of the
   total N- and P-loss could be attributed to the duckweed mat. The
   remaining quarter is due to non-duckweed related components: uptake and
   nitrification/denitrification by algae and bacteria attached to the
   walls and the sediment of the system (including sedimentation). Other
   processes, like NH3-volatilisation, N-fixation and nutrient uptake as
   well as nitrification/denitrification by suspended microorganisms did
   not influence the N- and P-balance of our systems, but could become
   important with increasing water depths and retention times. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Organic sludge dewatering, chemically induced by a complexation
   mechanism with oppositely charged reagents, was investigated through
   chemical modelization using low charged density anionic gels.
   Flocculation, which allows an easy removal of interparticular water by
   filtration, proceeds through specific surface interactions. Initially
   negatively charged, an aggregation of the porous beads can be achieved
   by complexation with oppositely charged polycations, either around full
   complexation (global balance of original negative sites on the gel by
   positive charges added) with low molecular weight species (LaCl3 or
   cationic polymers of low molecular weight) or at low complexation extent
   when specific surface interactions are favoured with high molecular
   weight species. On the other hand, the collapsed state of the particles
   can be reached only at full complexation of the anionic charges whatever
   is the size of the polycation. This complexation study, based upon
   electrostatic interactions, was transposed to organic colloids contained
   in wastewater sludge after characterization of their charge content. The
   results obtained with a set of municipal sludges, issued from different
   steps of the wastewater treatment, evidence that flocculation proceeds
   through a similar mechanism to the one depicted with the anionic network
   model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sludge was taken from laboratory-scale simulators of landfill bioreactor
   (LFBR) treating the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (OFMSW)
   over a period of 1 year. Population densities of acetogens, hydrogen-
   and acetate-utilizing methanogens and the specific methanogenic activity
   (SMA) on degrading butyrate, propionate, acetate and formate were
   measured. The results indicate that the Gompertz equation is a suitable
   model for describing the growth data of acetogens, hydrogen- and
   acetate-utilizing methanogens. The development of SMAs can be
   systematically described by a simple mathematical equation derived from
   the Gompertz equation. The measurements of bacterial population growth
   and methanogenic activity reveal that the SMA of acetate is an ultimate
   indicator for monitoring the OFMSW decomposition. Leachate recycling can
   stimulate the carbon flow from hydrolysis/fermentation through the
   hydrogen/acetate toward methane. A moisture content of 75\% is suggested
   to be an initial rapid decomposition threshold for the anaerobic organic
   refuse mineralization in a landfill bioreactor. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sulfolane is used in the treatment of sour natural gas. It is a highly
   water soluble compound that has been introduced into soils and
   groundwaters at a number of sour gas processing plant sites. Aquifer
   sediments from contaminated locations at three sites in western Canada
   were assessed for microbial activity and their ability to degrade
   sulfolane under aerobic and five anaerobic (nitrate-, Mn(IV)-, Fe(III)-,
   sulfate- and CO2-reducing) conditions. The microcosms were supplemented
   with 200 mg/L sulfolane and adequate supplies of N, P, and the
   appropriate terminal electron acceptor. Microcosms containing
   contaminated aquifer sediments from each of the three sites were able to
   degrade sulfolane aerobically at 8 degrees C and 28 degrees C, and the
   biodegradation followed zero-order kinetics. The lag limes before the
   onset of sulfolane biodegradation were shorter when
   sulfolane-contaminated sediments were used as inocula than when
   uncontaminated soils were used. No anaerobic sulfolane biodegradation
   was observed at 28 degrees C, nor was sulfolane biodegradation observed
   at 8 degrees C under Fe(III)-, sulfate- and CO2-reducing conditions. At
   8 degrees C, anaerobic degradation of sulfolane coupled to Mn(IV)
   reduction was observed in microcosms from two sites, and degradation
   coupled to nitrate reduction was seen in a microcosm from one of the
   contaminated sites. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Organo-clay sorbents were prepared by treating montmorillonite with four
   different quaternary ammonium compounds. The sorbents were then
   evaluated for the ability to remove a lower molecular weight hydrophobic
   organic, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB), from water in the presence of
   larger, more hydrophilic organics such as tannic acid. Removal of each
   sorbate species was characterized separately, then the organo-clays'
   removal of TCB was assessed in the presence of the tannic acid. The
   quaternary ammonium compounds used were tetramethylammonium chloride
   (TMA), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA),
   hexadecylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride (HDBDMA), and
   dioctodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDDMA). The adsorption isotherms of
   tannic acid onto the organo-clays were all nonlinear; the TMA-modified
   clay led to unfavorable curvature, while the long-chain surfactants all
   produced favorable curvature. The ability of the organo-clays to remove
   tannic acid increased in the order TMA < HDBDMA, inconsistent with the
   organic carbon content of the clays. Adsorption, rather than
   partitioning, was the uptake mechanism. In contrast, sorption of TCB
   onto,the organo clays was by a partitioning mechanism, indicated by
   linear isotherms, uptake proportional to the percentage of the CEC
   exchanged by HDTMA, and a low heat of sorption. With two distinctive
   uptake mechanisms, the capacity of the modified clays for TCB was not
   affected by the presence of tannic acid, even with applied tannic acid
   concentrations of 50 mg/L. X-ray diffraction indicated that the tannic
   acid was excluded from internal sites, due to its size and polarity.
   Organo-clays thus may be usable to retain smaller, hydrophobic organic
   compounds such as TCB with no loss of capacity in the presence of tannic
   acid or similar natural organic matter present in surface and
   groundwaters. This was confirmed for TCB sorption in the presence of a
   humic acid sample. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   with the colour reagent has a maximum wavelength at 600 nm, giving a low
   detection limit of 0.5 mu g l(-1) for cyanide and 1.5 mu g l(-1) for
   thiocyanate. Two proposed processes - 1,3-dimethylbarbituric acid
   combined with formaldehyde masking cyanide and the ferric-thiocyanate
   methods - can simultaneously determine free and other simple forms of
   cyanide and thiocyanate existing at pH 5.2; comparison of results
   demonstrates that both approaches are in agreement. By taking into
   account the effect of temperature on colour development and by using the
   ratio of the regression slopes, one kind of standard solution
   (thiocyanate) can be used for both cyanide and thiocyanate calibration,
   thereby avoiding the need to use toxic cyanide standard solutions. (C)

Abstract = {{On-line measurements of the activity of activated sludge biomass may
   allow more efficient operation of treatment plants. A novel monitor for
   activity which can be used on-line follows oxygen evolution from
   hydrogen peroxide by catalase activity in activated sludge. Results from
   this monitor were compared with assays of oxygen uptake rate (OUR) by
   respirometry. Samples from the five activated sludge plants were assayed
   and showed, as expected, that the mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS)
   and volatile suspended solids (VSS) levels were a poor measure of the
   activity of the sample determined by OUR. However, the activity of the
   biomass determined by the catalase activity biomass monitor correlated
   well with the respiration rate. This monitor should provide a simple and
   robust alternative to OUR measurements in activated sludge plants. (C)

Abstract = {{Stability is an important compost quality characteristic, but also one
   that is difficult to measure. A simple respirometric technique for the
   assessment of compost stability (SOUR test) was developed, that utilises
   a dissolved oxygen probe to measure changes in the oxygen concentration
   in an aqueous compost extract, under conditions ensuring optimum
   microbial activity and maximum reaction rates. A fully automated
   procedure is described and possible problems are discussed. The method
   was used to follow changes in stability of sewage sludge composts from a
   commercial plant using the windrow composting system. Two different
   batches of material were monitored. Results were compared with three
   other stability tests, a respirometric method utilising solid compost
   samples and the COD and optical density of compost water extracts. Both
   respiration tests indicated increasing compost stability with processing
   time and gave significant correlation both with compost age and with
   each other. The SOUR of the raw mixture was different for the two
   batches (9.3 and 18.4 mg O(2)gVS/h), but after composting and maturation
   both dropped to about 1 mg O-2/g VS/h. Measuring the respiration rate of
   an aqueous compost suspension rather than a solid compost sample offers
   certain advantages: the test is not affected by variations in the matric
   water potential of the samples; there is immediate contact between
   substrate, microbes and oxygen leading to maximum reaction rates; and
   the gas-liquid barrier for oxygen diffusion at the surface of the
   compost particles is omitted. The COD and the optical density of the
   water extracts did not show clear trends and did not allow any
   conclusions about compost stability to be drawn. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this investigation was to develop a system for the
   remediation of acid mine drainage using sulphate-reducing bacteria. An
   upflow porous medium bioreactor was inoculated with sulphate-reducing
   bacteria (SRB) and operated under acidic conditions. The reactor was
   operated under continuous flow and was shown to be capable of sulfate
   reduction at pH 4.5, 4.0, 3.5 and 3.25 in a medium containing 16.1 mM
   sodium lactate. This contrasted previously published work which showed
   that, at pH 3.8, organic acid concentrations greater than 5 mM
   completely inhibited biological sulfate-reduction. At pH 3.25 the
   reactor removed 38.3\% of influent sulfate and raised the pH of the
   medium to 5.82. The lactate carbon source was exhausted under these
   conditions. At pH 3.0, sulfide production was below detectable levels,
   and sulfate removal fell to 14.4\%. However, viable SRB were recovered
   from the column after 21 days of operation at pH 3.0, indicating that
   SRB are capable of withstanding pH 3.0 for extended periods. From these
   results we can conclude that an SRB process would be a viable method of
   remediating AMD. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of freezing, acidification, refrigeration and extended
   storage without refrigeration on measured concentrations of forms of
   nitrogen and phosphorus were assessed in water samples taken from
   polluted and unpolluted streams in dry and wet weather. Emphasis was
   placed on likely changes associated with the use of automatic samplers
   in field conditions. The response of measured nutrient concentrations to
   different preservation methods and to extended storage without
   preservation varied widely between samples. For polluted streams where
   nutrient concentrations were high (ammoniacal nitrogen > 0.1 mg l(-1);
   oxidised nitrogen, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, total and filterable
   phosphorus > 1 mg l(-1)), there was generally little proportional change
   in nutrients other than ammoniacal nitrogen after up to 6 d of storage
   without preservation. Where nutrient concentrations were low, up to 90\%
   of ammoniacal nitrogen, 50\% of oxidised nitrogen, 84\% of total
   Kjeldahl nitrogen and 67\% of total phosphorus was lost after 6 d. If
   samples cannot be retrieved immediately, automatic samplers should be
   refrigerated where possible. Acidification is a suitable alternative for
   preservation of nitrogen. Samples for filterable phosphorus should be
   filtered as soon as possible after collection. in some circumstances,
   unpreserved samples may provide an acceptable level of accuracy for
   evaluation of broad temporal trends or estimation of nutrient loadings.

Abstract = {{The treatment of anoxic waste stabilization pond effluent was
   investigated using crossflow microfiltration in conjunction with dynamic
   membranes. The primary membrane used throughout the study was made of
   woven polyester, while the dynamic membrane was formed of manganese
   dioxide (MnO2). Effluent from a lab-scale anoxic waste stabilization
   pond was treated with and without the addition of slug doses of
   polyaluminum silicate sulphate (PASS) as a coagulant, Removal of
   suspended solids, turbidity, COD and E. coli was found to be affected by
   feed turbidity and the addition of PASS, On the other hand, removal of
   Streptococcus faecalis and algal species was found to be 100\% and was
   not affected by feed turbidity. This was attributed to their size which
   could be more than the pore size of the dynamic membrane. Addition of
   slug doses of PASS were found to have a positive effect on the permeate
   flux and quality, which was attributed to the influence of crossflow
   velocity on the agglomerated particles. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{An electrochemical analog of a biofilm was constructed to test the
   accuracy of oxygen flux measurements using microelectrodes. We used a
   cathodically polarized graphite felt attached to the bottom of a Bat
   plate open channel reactor as the reactive surface consuming oxygen. The
   oxygen flux to the felt was calculated from the polarization current.
   Microelectrodes were used to measure the oxygen profiles above and
   within the graphite felt. From the shape of the oxygen profile we
   evaluated the oxygen Aux to the graphite fell. This provided us with two
   sets of data, the true oxygen flux, calculated from polarization
   current, and the oxygen flux estimated from microelectrode measurements.
   Comparing these two fluxes, for different Bow velocities, showed that
   the fluxes evaluated from the polarization current were different from
   those evaluated from the oxygen profiles. The differences were likely
   caused by the presence of the microelectrode in the mass boundary layer
   and/or by the simplifying assumptions accepted in computational
   procedures employed to calculate oxygen fluxes. For low flow velocities,
   between zero and 1.0 cm s(-1), the differences were velocity sensitive;
   the higher the Bow velocity, the bigger the difference. For higher flow
   velocities, between 1 cm s(-1) and 3 cm s(-1) the flux of oxygen
   estimated from the microelectrode measurements was consistently
   approximately 80\% higher than the true oxygen flux estimated from the
   polarization current. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Suspended particulate matter from the surface waters of the Susquehanna,
   Christina and Brandywine Rivers was collected by tangential how
   filtration to study copper partitioning. Copper adsorption increased
   with an increase of suspended particles and decreased with low pH values
   or with an increase of dissolved organic matter. Effects of particulate
   organic matter on copper distribution between suspended particulate and
   solution phases were studied using modified aluminum oxide. An increase
   of particulate organic matter enhanced copper adsorption. Copper
   adsorption per mass of particulate organic carbon was similar for the
   different sources of suspended particles. A model, based on copper
   adsorption on particles and complexation with dissolved organic matter,
   was developed to assess copper partition coefficient as a function of
   the easily measurable water quality parameters: pH, alkalinity,
   dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic matter. The
   partitioning model was calibrated on pH edge data using suspended
   particles collected from the three rivers. The model was verified using
   partitioning data as a function of dissolved organic matter. The model
   adequately describes the system containing natural suspended solids
   collected from the surface waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Adsorption capacities of cadmium on aquifer material of the Sava River
   alluvial sediment were determined as a function of flow rate, pH and
   presence of organic coating using laboratory column technique. In a
   permeameter with constant hydrostatic pressure, a laboratory coefficient
   of permeability, K-l, and a specific coefficient of permeability, K-s,
   have been determined. The value Of 28.6 Darcy for specific permeability
   shows that the sediment belongs to a good aquifer (permeability > 1
   Darcy). The adsorption capacity of cadmium at the bottom of the
   breakthrough curve, C-sb, of a fresh sediment at pH 5.8 varied from 0.40
   to 0.45 mg g(-1) at axial flow rate between 98 and 501 cm h(-1) Capacity
   values of maximum adsorption, C-s, were in the range from 0.67 to 0.72
   mg g(-1). This implied a significance of C-sb values in risk assessment
   studies concerning a discharge of cadmium into rivers and lakes and its
   input to groundwater layers. Distribution coefficients, K-d, were
   between 26.3 and 28.2 ml g(-1). In order to create a more reproducible
   column, a fraction between 125 and 250 mu m was used. In that case C-s
   values varied from 0.25 mg g(-1) at pH 2.5 (organic coating present) to
   1.12 mg g(-1) at pH 5.8 (organic coating removed). (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Batch sorption studies have been carried out to determine the effect of
   adsorbent dose, initial sorbate concentration and pH on the adsorption
   of Cr(VI) on polymer-grafted sawdust. The process was found to be pH,
   temperature and concentration dependent. An empirical relationship has
   been obtained to predict the percentage Cr(VI) removal at any time for
   known values of sorbent and initial sorbate concentration under observed
   test conditions. The effect of diverse ions has been studied and it is
   found that there is very little effect on the sorption of Cr(VI). The
   process was found to be exothermic with a maximum adsorption of 91.0\%
   at 30 degrees C for an initial concentration of 100 mg l(-1) at pH 3.
   The process follows first-order kinetics and the data fits the
   Freundlich adsorption isotherm. Thermodynamic parameters were also
   evaluated. Desorption studies confirmed that adsorbent can be
   effectively regenerated using 0.2 M NaOH and 0.5 M NaCl and can then be
   reused. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{At the present time, somatic and male-specific coliphage and human
   enterovirus groups are being considered as indicators of possible
   pathogenic human enteric virus contamination from fecal contamination. A
   primary attribute for any indicator of fecal contamination is its
   prevalence at the source and in associated ground water. It must be
   consistently found in the source material at concentrations that are
   measurable with available techniques. Over a period of ten months,
   male-specific and somatic coliphage ranged from similar to 7000 to
   similar to 4,000,000 PFU/L in the effluent from a multi-user
   septic-tank. Unlike the values determined for septic-tank effluent,
   coliphage concentrations measured in ground water over this same period
   only varied by five-fold. Coliphage concentration in ground water under
   the down-gradient edge of the drainfield contained similar to 1000
   PFU/L. This concentration decreased at -1 log(10)/5 m during 17.4 m of
   ground-water transport. From these data, coliphage concentrations in
   septic-tank effluent seem sufficient to allow their use as indicators of
   fecal contamination in ground water. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   removed from solution by other activated sludges but this occurrence is

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Biological denitrification of drinking water was studied in up-flow
   laboratory reactors packed with wheat straw which served as the sole
   carbon source as well as the only physical support for the
   microorganisms. The highest rates of denitrification (0.053 g N removed
   l(-1) d(-1)) were observed in fresh reactors during their first week of
   operation and the efficiency of the process declined thereafter. The
   addition of fresh wheat straw brought about a temporary improvement of
   the denitrification performance and a regime of one weekly addition
   prevented the deterioration of a reactor which was operated for 5
   months. The rate of denitrification was affected by the water velocity

Abstract = {{Gallic acid was used as a model inhibitor in a series of batch trials
   examining the anaerobic digestion of a substrate based on starch (1
   g/l). Simple organic compounds were also added in trace (5 mg/l)
   quantities. The inhibition of digestion efficiency was assessed in terms
   of biogas production and gas composition. Some of the trace organics,
   specifically glucose and glycine, behaved antagonistically to the
   inhibitory effects of the gallic acid. The effect was quantified in
   terms of an activity term, based on the methane volumes produced. For
   glucose, its value was 56\% and for glycine it was 38\%.. Altering the
   amounts of glucose did change the extent of the antagonism. In practical
   terms, the most effective concentration would be between 8 and 10 mg/l.

Abstract = {{Assessed was the effect of a man-induced interference in an estuarine
   system by monitoring a set of hydrographic and sedimentary variables
   together with a faunal survey of intertidal mudflats. A reference site
   was established in a nearby unpolluted estuary. A principal components
   analysis (PCA) reduced the original environmental data to a few more
   manageable factors. PCA factor I, defined by changes in salinity at the
   surface of the water column and dissolved oxygen at the bottom,
   explained 40\% of the total variance. Pair-wise correlations between
   different structural metrics and PCA factor I explained up to 70\% of
   the variability observed in the community metrics, Macrobenthic
   communities were simpler (with minor values of abundance, diversity,
   evenness and a much lower value of biomass) where disserved oxygen at
   the bottom of the water column was minimum. An afaunal stage developed
   along intertidal mudflats where anoxic conditions prevailed. There was a
   large ``weight-of-evidence{''} that a depletion of dissolved oxygen was
   causing a severe stress to the estuarine biota. (C) 1998 Elsevier

   includes: microorganisms responsible for EBPR, isolation of

   EBPR sludge, biochemical metabolisms of PAOs, energy budget in PAOs
   metabolism, denitrification by PAOs: glycogen accumulating non-poly-P
   organisms (GAOs), etc. Since pure cultures which possess complete
   characteristics of PAOs have not been isolated yet, the biochemical
   mechanism cannot be definitively described. The criteria to obtain a
   pure culture isolate are proposed. Based on the review, essential
   characteristics of PAOs are summarized in a table and directions for
   future research are identified. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes the main applications of ozonation and associated
   oxidation processes in the treatment of natural waters (surface and
   ground waters) for drinking water production. In fact, oxidants may be
   added at several points throughout the treatment: pre-oxidation,
   intermediate oxidation or final disinfection. So, the numerous effects
   of chemical oxidation are discussed along the water treatment: removal
   of inorganic species, aid to the coagulation-floculation process,
   degradation of organic matter and disinfection. Of prime importance in
   potable water production is the removal of organic matter (natural humic
   substances, as well as micropollutants, especially pesticides) to avoid
   degradation of the distributed water (mainly bad odors and tastes;
   formation of disinfection by-products such as trihalomethanes; microbial
   regrowth in the distribution system). Consequently, this point has been
   particularly detailed in this paper. As a matter of fact, complete
   mineralization hardly occurs during the process; as a consequence,
   further treatment (i.e. sand or granular activated carbon filtration! is
   required to improve the distributed water quality, and to meet the
   drinking water regulations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A new two-phase swirl-flow monolithic type reactor was designed to study
   the kinetics of heterogeneous photocatalytic processes on semiconductor
   catalysts. Most of the earlier work investigated the effects of various
   parameters on the initial degradation rate (or the formation of CO2) of
   the pollutants. In the present study, photomineralization of
   4-nitrophenol (4-NP) sensitized by Degussa P'S TiO2 in aqueous solution
   has been investigated as a function of the following different
   experimental parameters: initial concentration of pollutant (C-so),
   light intensity (I-a), partial pressure of oxygen (p(o2)), catalyst
   concentration, pH, chloride ion and temperature. The kinetic expression
   obtained can be described by the following formula r(s)=k(o) exp
   (-E/RT)(IalphaKo2Po2)-K-beta/(1 + K(o2)p(o2))KsCs(1 + KsCso). The
   apparent overall activation energy for 4-NP obtained was 7.32 kJ mol(-1)
   by fitting the above equation with experimental data and the values for
   beta, K-o2 and K-s were 0.84, 9.98 atm(-1) and 0.075 ppm(-1)
   respectively. The kinetic equation can predict the concentration of 4-NP
   during the entire degradation process at pH value of 4.3 and TiO2
   concentration of 2 g l(-1), and is therefore, more meaningful. It can be
   used in the development of large-scale photocatalytic reactor and
   optimization of experimental conditions for any particular studies.
   Furthermore, the photodegradation of 4-NP on two different catalysts
   (P25 and UV100) was compared and the photonic efficiency of the process
   has also been investigated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The pathway for the ozonolysis of benz{[}a]anthracene (BaA) (ACS
   standard named), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), has been
   described in this paper. BaA was dissolved in a 90\% acetonitrile:water
   (v/v) mixture to achieve an initial concentration of 1 mM. The
   ozonolysis of BaA was evaluated using different ozone dosages. The
   ozonation products were identified by gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS). Fifteen products including eight pairs of isomers
   were identified. Ozone reacted with BaA simultaneously by bond and atom
   attack. Ozone attack on the carbon at the 7 and/or 12 position produced
   the quinone or hydroxyl functional groups. The bond attack type of
   reaction occurred at the 5,6 position and caused ring cleavage resulting
   in phenyl-naphthyl type products. Ozonolysis of BaA in this solvent
   mixture occurred preferentially by bond attack rather than by the atom
   attack type of reaction, (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The occurrence of 32 drug residues belonging to different medicinal
   classes like antiphlogistics, lipid regulators. psychiatric drugs,
   antiepileptic drugs, betablockers and beta(2)-sympathomimetics as well
   as five metabolites has been investigated in German municipal sewage
   treatment plant (STP) discharges, river and stream waters. Due to the
   incomplete removal of drug residues during passage through a STP, above
   80\% of the selected drugs were detectable in at least one municipal STP
   effluent with concentration levels up to 6.3 mu g l(-1) (carbamazepine)
   and thus resulting in the contamination of the receiving waters. 20
   different drugs and 4 corresponding metabolites were measured in river
   and stream waters. Mainly acidic drugs like the lipid regulators
   bezafibrate, gemfibrozil, the antiphlogistics diclofenac, ibuprofen,
   indometacine, naproxen, phenazone and the metabolites clofibric acid,
   fenofibric acid and salicylic acid as well as neutral or weak basic
   drugs like the betablockers metoprolol, propranolol and the
   antiepileptic drug carbamazepine were found to be ubiquitously present
   in the rivers and streams, mostly in the ng l(-1)-range. However,
   maximum concentrations were determined up to 3.1 mu g l(-1) and median
   values as high as 0.35 mu g l(-1) (both bezafibrate). The drugs detected
   in the environment were predominantly applied in human medicine. It can
   therefore be assumed that the load of municipal STP effluents in the
   surface water highly influences the contamination. Due to their wide
   spread presence in the aquatic environment many of these drugs have to
   be classified as relevant environmental chemicals. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Generation of hydroxy] radical, one of the major reactive species in the
   ozonation of water, was directly and quantitatively measured with the
   combination technique of spin-trapping, stopped-flow and electron spin
   resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Hydroxyl radical in ozonated water was
   trapped with 5,5-dimethyl-pyrrolidine-1-oxyl (DMPO) as a stable radical,
   DMPO-OH, and the amount of DMPO-OH was quantitatively measured with an
   ESR spectrometer. The ESR signal of DMPO-OH increased linearly with
   increasing ozone and 1 M ozone produced 0.011 M DMPO-OH, if one molecule
   of ozone produces one molecule of (OH)-O-.. The kinetics of DMPO-OH
   generation was determined with a stopped-flow/ESR method and analyzed by
   two different methods. The logarithmic plot of the initial velocity of
   DMPO-OH generation vs the ozone concentration gave a linear
   relationship, which was expressed as v(o) (M s(-1)) = 8.7 x 10(1)
   x{[}O-3 (M)](2.25). The rate constant of DMPO-OH generation, 8.7 x 10(1)
   M-1.25 s(-1) is close to the reaction constant of ozone with an
   hydroxide ion. The decomposition rate of ozone to (OH)-O-. was estimated
   to be 0.026 s(-1) at 40 mu M aqueous ozone from the semilogarithmic plot
   of the amount of DMPO-OH against reaction time. The presence of phenol
   derivatives increased both the generation rate and the final amount of
   DMPO-OH in a dose dependent manner. The enhancing effect of phenols on
   (OH)-O-. generation was also analyzed with the above two methods the
   decomposition of ozone and the generation of DMPO-OH. The effect
   depended on the kind, position and number of substituents of phenol. The
   chlorine substitution of phenol had a more enhancing effect than that of
   methyl substitution and the ortho-substitution by chlorine showed a
   stronger enhancement. 2,4-Dichlorophenol showed the strongest enhancing
   effect on (OH)-O-. generation among phenols examined, followed by
   2-chlorophenol. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluating composite ion exchangers (CIX) for improved stability of

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{An extensive laboratory study demonstrated that the stability of
   anaerobic biological processes can be improved and the process failure
   prevented by retaining specialty functionalized polymers inside the
   reactors. Such functionalized polymers, referred to as composite ion
   exchanger (CLX), are essentially microbeads of chelating exchanger
   encapsulated in fibrous, cloth-like polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon.
   During the course of the investigation, severe stresses were introduced
   into a train of anaerobic reactors through organic and heavy-metal
   overloading of the Feed. The reactors containing CIX successfully
   survived the stresses by dissipating the inhibitory hydrogen ions and
   dissolved heavy metals from the aqueous phase. The reactors containing
   no CIX always failed under stress conditions, all other conditions
   remaining identical. The CIXs were found to be chemically stable,
   durable, did not require any intermittent cleaning or regeneration, and
   occupied less than one percent of the reactor volume. Due to its
   thin-sheet like morphology, CIX can be easily introduced into or
   withdrawn from a biological medium without any difficulty. The proposed
   control technique does not warrant an). external intervention and may
   replace the need for continuous dosage of excess alkalinity. (C) 1998

Title = {{Changes in sediment phosphorus as a result of eutrophication and

Abstract = {{Since the creation of Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands, in 1956, a period of
   eutrophication has been followed by a period of oligotrophication.
   Around 1970, the lake switched from clear to turbid and recently from
   turbid to clear. The effect of eutrophication and oligotrophication has
   been studied with a conceptual model, based on the mass balance of total
   phosphorus in the top layer of the sediment. The model has been applied
   to the shallow part and the deeper part of Lake Veluwe. Whereas drastic
   changes in the external phosphorus lending? and concomitantly the
   phosphorus concentration in the lake water, occurred, the phosphorus
   pool in the sediment top layer only responds gradually to changed
   boundary conditions. The phosphorus content in the sediment top layer of
   the deeper part of Lake Veluwe doubled between 1956 and 1979. After 1979
   it decreased. Losses were due to infiltration of dissolved phosphorus
   and burial of solid phosphorus caused by net sedimentation with material
   from the shallow part of the lake. Sensitivity analyses revealed that
   sediment phosphorus is also primary affected by these two factors. Based
   on the model predictions it is expected that in 2006 the phosphorus
   content of the sediment will be below the phosphorus content at creation
   of Lake Veluwe. Changes in flushing of the lake will probably have
   little effect on sediment phosphorus, while development of macrophytes
   will cause higher phosphorus contents in the shallow areas. However,
   with the current boundary conditions further ecological improvement of
   Lake Veluwe may be expected. The phosphorus pool in the sediment top
   layer is an important determinant in the long-term development of
   shallow lake ecosystems and, therefore, the modeling concept may also be
   applicable to other shallow lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The removal of lead by sorption on granulated blast-furnace slag has
   been investigated as a function of pH, the metal ion concentration, the
   particle size and the amount of sorbent. It has been established that
   the process occurs with increasing pH. It was found that the dependence
   of the process on pH is similar to the dependence of the formation of
   soluble and insoluble hydrolysis products of lead on pH. but the
   efficient lead removal by granulated slag is occurred at pH values lower
   than precipitation pH values, i.e, the sorption is a predominating
   process. The equilibrium in the slag/lead solution system is described
   by the Freundlich adsorption isotherm. The constants in the Freundlich
   equation have been calculated for different slag particle sizes at
   pH(in) = 5.0-5.1. The percentage of lead removal at equilibrium
   increases with increasing slag amount but the sorption capacity
   decreases. Depending on the conditions, a percent lead removal of
   97-98\% can be achieved. The results obtained could be useful for the
   application of granulated slag for the Pb-ions removal from industrial
   waste water. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A modeling study was conducted to evaluate the impact of body-contact
   recreation (e.g., water skiing, jet skiing, swimming) on pathogen
   concentrations in a source drinking water reservoir under construction
   in eastern Riverside County in Southern California. A hybridized Monte
   Carlo-finite segment model was used to pl edict pathogen concentrations
   in the reservoir resulting from pathogen inputs associated with shed
   fecal material and accidental fecal releases (AFRs). Monte Carlo
   techniques were incorporated into the finite segment model to define
   characteristics about individual recreators which affect pathogen
   loading to the reservoir (e.g., infection, pathogen shedding rate,
   location). Results of simulations are provided in the form of cumulative
   distribution and probability density functions derived from uncertainty
   analyses. The model predicted considerable spatial and temporal
   variability in pathogen concentrations within the reservoir, with
   elevated levels of Cryptosporidium rotavirus, and poliovirus in the
   epilimnion during periods of high recreational use. Predicted Giardia
   concentrations were lower than the other pathogens. Hypolimnetic
   concentrations of all pathogens were generally 1-3 orders of magnitude
   lower than the overlying epilimnetic concentrations. Model results also
   suggest that field sampling will underestimate the mean, range and
   variance of pathogen concentrations in the reservoir. The model was
   further modified to include a particle tracking scheme to allow for
   transport of aggregated fecal material. Results from simulations using
   this approach demonstrate a potential for high pathogen loads due to
   body-contact recreation periodically reaching treatment plants. (C) 1998

   coefficient assumed to be constant in previous models is taken to be a
   function of residence time of water in pipes based on the findings of

   introduced to convert simple one dimensional model solutions into

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{A screening study was conducted on samples from a Llobregat river water
   works plant (WWP) in order to establish a better treatment for the
   removal of organic pollutants. The Llobregat river is a polluted rivet
   supplying water to Barcelona (Spain) and its surroundings with a
   population of approximately 3.2 million. A broad spectrum and high
   levels of organic chemicals were found in river water, including
   hydrocarbons, pesticides, surfactants, plasticizers and trihalomethanes.
   Despite a variety of treatment processes employed in the studied plant,
   a satisfactory removal of organic compounds from water is not
   guaranteed. Given that, improvement in water quality is achieved with
   the implementation of filtration with Granular Activated Carbon (GAC).
   Seven control column tests (CCT) with analytical GAC were conducted in
   series with their seven respective large column adsorbers to determine
   the performance of each GAG. Organic compounds from samples of raw and
   drinking water were collected by passing approximately 1000 l of water
   through a column of analytical GAC (representing monthly averages).
   Selected target compounds previously identified in raw and drinking
   water (trihalomethanes: bromoform: pesticides: terbutylazine and
   molinate, surfactants: polyethoxylated nonylphenols: plasticizers:
   diethyl phthalate and tri-n-butyl phosphate; halogenated compounds:
   trichlorobenzenes. 2-chloro pyridine: miscellaneous compounds: 2-ethyl
   hexanol, trimethyl-cyclohexenone, bromo-trimethyl-benzenes,
   bromo-polyethoxylated nonylphenols) were studied to predict the behavior
   of seven different commercial GACs. These pollutants were efficiently
   removed by using GAC bituminous coal based. The determination of organic
   compounds was carried out by using Soxhlet extraction and
   high-resolution gas chromatography with low resolution mass spectrometry
   (HRGC/ LRMS) analysis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Flow-through column experiments were conducted to estimate the change of
   the concentration of three chlorinated VOCs (chloroform,
   trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene) in two types of soil. The two
   soils were a terra rosa with organic carbon content of 1.32\% and a
   sandy clay loam with organic carbon content of 0.26\%. The experiments
   took place for 116 mu g/l single solutes in the absence and presence of
   humic acid (10 and 30 mg/l). Effluent concentrations depended on the
   individual compound, the carbon content of the soil, and the presence of
   humic acid. In the absence of humic acid, chloroform showed the highest
   effluent concentration. or equivalently the smallest extent of
   adsorption. When humic acid was added to the feed solution, the VOC
   effluent concentration increased. This was more severe for chloroform
   and trichloroethylene. The higher the concentration of humic acid in the
   feed solution, the higher the concentration of each of the VOCs in the
   soil bed effluent. The increased inability was attributed to the binding
   of the organic contaminants to the humic molecules affecting their
   solubility in the soil aqueous phase. In the case of tetrachloroethylene
   a small degree of biodegradation was also observed as indicated by the
   appearance of trichloroethylene. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents data on the concentrations of six heavy metals,
   copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd) and
   chromium (Cr), in sediments and fish sampled from inland waters of Hong
   Kong. Sediments and tilapia (Tilapia mossambica) were collected from
   Shing Mun River (at Fo Tan, Tai Wai and Siu Lek Yuen), Lam Tsuen River
   (at Tai Wo) and Tai Po River (at Tai Po), as well as from a commercial
   fish pond at Mai Po) for comparison. The total concentrations of the six
   metals in river sediments were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than
   those collected from the fish pond. The highest metal concentrations of
   Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd and Cr were recorded in the sediment of Po Tan at Shing
   Mun River, with the values of 449, 1220, 67.0, 4.03 and 85.4 mg kg(-1)
   (dry weight), respectively, On average, the total metal contamination in
   sediments followed the order of Fo Tan>Tai Wai >Tai Wo > Siu Lek Yuen >
   Tai Po > Mai Po. Different metals seemed to accumulate in different
   organs of fish (muscle. gill, skin and visceral. A substantial amount of
   heavy metals was observed in tilapia which lived in contaminated
   environment (Fo Tan and Tai Wail, when compared to those collected from
   the fish pond. Tilapia collected from Fo Tan contained the highest
   concentrations of Cu (166 mu g g(-1)) and Zn (266 mu g g(-1)).
   Significant relationships (p < 0.05) between metals in different
   chemical fractions (exchangeable. carbonate, Fe-Mn oxide, organic and
   residual) of sediments and metals in fish organs (Cu in viscera, Zn in
   skin, Pb in all organs and Cr in muscle) were found. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An investigation into the kinetics of the treatment of soybean
   wastewater in an anaerobic filter is described. The substrate loading
   removal rate was compared with predictions from a modified
   Stover-Kincannon model, the Monod model and a regression relationship.
   The modified Stover-Kincannon model produced the best fit with the
   experimental results. The modified Stover-Kincannon model could also be
   used to determine the reactor volume required to decrease a set influent
   organic concentration to a given effluent concentration, or to determine
   the effluent substrate concentration for a given volume of an anaerobic
   filter. and influent organic concentration. The overall reaction order
   in the anaerobic filter treating soybean wastewater appeared to be close
   to half order. The methane production kinetics could be described by a
   similar relationship that used to describe the organic substrate removal
   kinetics of the anaerobic filter treating soybean wastewater. The
   kinetic relationships derived from the lab-scale experiment provided
   good estimates of the performance of pilot- and full-scale anaerobic
   filters packed with the same media and treating the same wastewater in
   terms of the effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and
   the specific methane production rates. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The influence of oxygen pressure (0.4 and 2 MPa). reaction time (30 and
   60 min) and temperature (260 and 280 degrees C) on the wet oxidation of
   quinoline has been studied. The dominant parameters for the
   decomposition of quinoline were oxygen pressure and reaction
   temperature. whereas the reaction time was less important within the
   range studied. Nitrifying bacteria were used to measure the inhibition
   from wet oxidative-treated samples to study the effect of the (wet
   oxidation) reaction conditions. Wet oxidation made quinoline more toxic
   to Nitrosomonas. This was observed for Nitrobacter as well if low oxygen
   pressure or long reaction times were used. The reaction products derived
   from the experiment in which quinoline was mostly decomposed were
   studied with respect to biological degradation. The results showed that
   these products were highly digestible under activated sludge treatment.
   The combined wet oxidation and biological treatment of reaction products
   resulted in 91\% oxidation of the parent compound to CO2 and water.
   Following combined wet oxidation and biological treatment the sample
   showed low toxicity towards Nitrosomonas and no toxicity towards
   Nitrobacter. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biological treatment is an indispensable instrument for water management
   of non-wood pulp mills, either as internal measure or end of pipe. In
   this paper, anaerobic treatment of wastewaters derived from the
   thermomechanical pulping (TMP) of hemp (Cannabis saliva L.) is
   described. Hemp stem wood and hemp bark TMP wastewaters were treated in
   laboratory scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors. For
   both types of wastewater, maximal COD removal of 72\% were obtained at
   loading rates of 13-16 g COD . l(-1) d(-1), providing 59-63\% recovery
   of the influent COD as methane. The reactors continued to provide
   excellent COD removal efficiencies of 63-66\% up to a loading rate of 27
   g COD.l(-1) d(-1), being the highest loading rate tested. Batch toxicity
   assays revealed the absence of methanogenic inhibition by hemp TMP
   wastewaters, coinciding with the high acetoclastic activity of the
   reactor sludge of approximately 1 g COD.g VSS-1 d(-1). Due to the
   relatively low molecular weight of hemp TMP lignin, its removal
   (measured as UV280) during anaerobic treatment was remarkably high and
   averaged 45 and 31\% for the hemp stem wood and the hemp bark TMP UASB
   reactors, respectively. Gel permeation chromatography revealed that the
   lignin removed corresponded to the lowest molecular weight derivatives.
   Subsequent batch aerobic post-treatment led to a considerable increase
   of color levels and polymerization of the residual lignin to molecular
   weights in excess of 34 kD. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Denitrification rates in a freshwater sediment were measured
   simultaneously with the N-2 flux method and the N-15 isotope pairing
   technique, using a continuous flow-through system designed for direct
   application of both techniques. With the N-2 flux method,
   denitrification was 151 +/- 4 mu mol N m(-2 h-1) and with the isotope
   pairing technique denjtrification was 149 +/- 4 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1).
   These identical results strongly suggested that both methods measured
   the true denitrification activity in the system. Using the conventional
   batch modes, the N-2 flux method has shown much larger denitrification
   rates than N-15 isotope pairing. This discrepancy could be explained by
   the much longer incubation time and smaller water column, required by
   the N-2 flux method. Model simulations of a N-2 flux batch incubation
   showed how NO3- and NH4+ accumulated in the water column and in turn
   increased nitrification and denitrification activity much above the
   initial level. as incubation proceeded. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A theoretical computation approach and a classification method of
   two-reference-states for the acidification capacity of natural waters
   are developed after its definition, determination procedure and
   classification methods are demonstrated. In the theoretical computation
   of acidification capacity, the alkalinity, pH, chemical oxygen demand
   and Al(III) components of waters are chosen as the original parameters.
   The contribution of carbonate, dissolved organic matter, and soluble
   aluminum to the acidification capacity is, respectively, emphasized. On
   the basis of theory of aquatic chemistry and the aquatic status of
   Southwest Area of China, the calibration value of methyl orange
   alkalinity to TIP alkalinity is calculated as 49 mu M. The CaCO3 water
   system which balances with CO2 in the atmosphere, and the water system
   which holds the critical pH and balances with CO2 in the atmosphere are
   considered as the reference state of the waters difficult to
   acidification and the critical state of acidified water. The annual
   amount of acid deposition including precipitation and dry deposition is
   used as the reference criterion to classify the waters easy and
   difficult to acidification. As a case study, this model is applied to
   the southwest area of China, and some compatible results have been
   obtained. This model makes it possible to estimate the acidification
   trend of natural waters in a large scale of area. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anaerobic biosolids deposition on the membrane surface has a significant
   effect on flux decline in membrane-coupled anaerobic bioreactors (MCAB).
   The aim of this study was to investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of
   anaerobic biosolids during crossflow ultrafiltration of digestion broth
   in the MCAB. A theoretical approach to predict flux decline was made
   considering the biosolids transport mechanism based on hydrodynamics and
   surface interactions. The continuous size reduction of biosolids offered
   an exponential flux decline at the initial stage, as the biomass cake
   layers being formed by the deposition of smaller particles with
   back-transport velocities less than the flux. Since flux recovery could
   not be achieved readily on the way of ultrafiltration due to
   irreversible biofouling, the biosolids movement toward the membrane
   surface should be controlled at the beginning of the MCAB operation. The
   optimal operating condition which prevents biosolids deposition onto the
   membrane surface could be predicted by the evaluation of critical flux.

Abstract = {{Pollution resulting from leaking and failing landfills is of concern to
   public health due to contamination of community drinking water.
   Chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as trichloroethylene (TCE) are
   common to both municipal and hazardous waste landfills and are potential
   contaminants of groundwater. Landfill leachate typically contains large
   amounts of organic carbon, nitrogen, and heavy metals and possesses a
   low redox potential. The kinetics of TCE degradation using a toluene
   oxidizing bacteria Pseudomonas (Burkholderia) picketti PK01 under
   nitrate reducing conditions was determined both in the presence and
   absence of the common landfill contaminant cadmium. A first order rate
   law was found to describe TCE degradation by Pseudomonas (Burkholderia)
   picketti PK01 over the TCE concentration range investigated. The rate
   constant for TCE degradation under denitrifying conditions in the
   absence of cadmium was 2.1 x 10(-4) ml/mu g protein/h. The rate constant
   for TCE degradation in the presence of 5 ppm cadmium was determined to
   be 6.5 x 10(-5) ml/mu g protein/h: representing a sixty nine percent
   decrease in the rate constant. Significant TCE degradation occurred over
   the course of the experiments. Results indicate that the presence of 5
   ppm of cadmium had the effect of decreasing the TCE degradation activity
   of the microorganism Burkholderia picketti PK01. Implications for
   remediation and prediction of biodegradation of TCE in landfill impacted
   groundwater is discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In various activated sludge systems, the biomass grows under transient
   (unbalanced) conditions and the storage response (formation of internal
   polymers as the fastest adaptation to the changing environment) becomes
   important. The aim of the present work was to select mixed cultures with
   high storage response by cultivation on an acetate-limited medium in a
   completely mixed reactor operated with intermittent feed (CSTR-i) and to
   characterise their storage response by using batch experiments under
   different experimental conditions. Even though kinetic selection based
   on storage response should bring about predominance of floc-formers, in
   this work a bulking sludge was established steadily for long periods and
   starting from different inocula. Batch experiments showed that the mixed
   culture dominated by the filamentous bacteria presented immediate
   response to the substrate spike with both substrate removal and storage
   of it as PHB at high rates, in the range 740 divided by 920 and 510
   divided by 610 COD mg/COD g h, respectively. According to the COD
   balance, storage of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) was practically the
   only significant metabolism Moreover, these filaments were able to store
   PHB about up to their dry weight and were highly resistant to long
   starvation (24 h). Both high storage response and resistance to
   starvation can contribute to competitive advantage of these filaments in
   a large range of operating conditions. Nevertheless, inactivity under
   anoxic conditions makes easy to control bulking by metabolic selection.
   Although better insight into implications for full-scale plants must be
   gained, these results confirm that population dynamics under transient
   conditions is mainly due to storage phenomena and indicate that a
   competitive advantage of floc-formers against filaments, under such a
   selective pressure, has not to be considered as an absolute rule. (C)

Abstract = {{The relationships between structural (chemical or physical) and more
   general properties such as the surface electrokinetic potential (zeta
   potential or isoelectric point) or spreading pressure of water were
   investigated for three powder activated carbon (PAC) samples
   (manufactured from woods, coconut shell and coal). The PAC samples were
   characterized by physical parameter measurements (such as zeta
   potential, specific surface area, spreading pressure) and chemical
   parameters; surface functional groups and structural mineral elements.
   Chemical studies show that all PAC samples contain large quantities of
   mineral ions, mostly calcium, sulfate and phosphate ions. These groups
   influence surface properties in the same way as do acidic or basic
   organic surface functional groups. The thermal treatment of activated
   carbon decreases acidic surface functional groups and this reaction
   accompanies an increase in the electrokinetic potential. The
   ``grafting{''} of a cationic polymer adds positive charge to activated
   carbon surfaces, but the quantity of surface functional groups is also
   modified by this process. Adsorption isotherms of water in activated
   carbon enable us to estimate initial polar adsorption sites. The
   localised adsorption of water on activated carbon is a function of the
   number of mineral ions and surface functional groups. Quantitative
   adsorption of water is related to the microporous volume. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Polluted artificial soils (average concentrations: Pb: 1460 pm; Zn: 2830
   ppm and Cd: 2.8 ppm) have been collected at the edge (less than 1 m) of
   the A-71 motorway in Sologne. These soils are characterized by XRD and a
   procedure of sequential extraction of Pb, Zn, Cd, Mn and Fe (Tessier et

   III, respectively ``exchangeable{''} ``carbonate-related'' and
   ``Fe-hydroxide-related{''} are dominant on the ``residual{''} fraction F
   V. Fraction F IV ``related to organic matter{''} is mostly significant
   for Pb. A study of the different size fractions indicates a strong metal
   enrichment in the finest one (<20 mu m) while sequential extractions
   suggest that small organic and Fe-hydroxide particles play a significant
   role in the fixation of Pb. Artificial soils and. for comparison,
   suspensions from a nearby retention pond (Lee ei al., 1996) have been
   submitted to 24 h leaching tests in HNO3 solutions of increasing acidity
   (10 to 100 mmol/L). Differences between both types of samples result
   mainly from the buffering effect of carbonates, present in artificial
   soils and lacking from suspensions. Acid leaching of the suspensions is
   equivalent to the sum F I + F II + F III while, probably for kinetic
   reasons, the amounts leached from artificial soils are lower. As deduced
   from both sequential extractions and leaching runs, the relative
   mobility of heavy metals is found to be: Cd>Zn>>Pb. suggesting that in
   carbonate-free systems moderately acid rainstorms may leach Cd and a
   port of Zn from the border of the motorway, while Pb would remain Bred.
   A similar mobility scale has been derived from the study of other highly
   polluted materials related to motorways (Lebreton and Thevenot. 1991:
   Colandini et al., 1995. Lee and Touray, 1997). When in addition Fe and
   Mn are considered, the mobility scale becomes Mn congruent to Cd >
   Zn>>Pb > Fe, for artificial soils as well as for suspensions, in spite
   of large differences in heavy metal contents and localizations. This is
   in agreement with the idea that most of the ``acid labile{''} heavy
   metals from suspensions are localized within a highly polluted material,
   comparable to artificial soils and diluted by a large proportion of
   local Sologne soil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of riverain iron and nutrient inputs on phytoplankton growth
   in Kesennuma Bay were studied. The effects of iron and Fulvic acid-iron
   complex additions on phytoplankton growth were studied in iron-enriched
   and -limited culture experiments of coastal marine diatom Chaetoceros
   sp. (the dominant species inside and outside of the bay) using media
   prepared from bay and outer waters. Bay water is not iron-limited. The
   addition of Fe(III) to bay water or autoclaved bay water gave no
   increase in cell yield. However, when bay water was autoclaved after
   UV-irradiation, there was little growth. This suggests that the UV
   irradiation destroyed organic compounds that affected iron
   bioavailability. Outer water is iron-limited. The addition of Fe(III) to
   outer water increased cell yield and iron-enriched outer water prepared
   by autoclaving after adding fulvic acid-Fe increased also cell yield.
   When outer water after adding Fe(III) was autoclaved, there was little
   growth. This suggests that fulvic acid made the iron bioavailable. The
   riverain inputs of organically bound iron, such as fulvic acid-Fe, and
   nutrients probably play an important role for supporting phytoplankton
   growth in the bay. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of powdered activated carbon (PAC) addition on the
   ultrafiltration characteristics of activated sludge were investigated.
   Particle size distribution of biological activated carbon (BAC) sludge
   shifted to the lower region compared with that of nonnal activated
   sludge due to the relatively smaller size of the added PAC. Although the
   total suspended solid (SS) of BAC sludge was higher than that of normal
   activated sludge and the floc size was reduced, the membrane
   permeability of BAC sludge was greatly enhanced compared with that of
   normal activated sludge. It is because the addition of PAC led to the
   decrease of not only the compressibility of sludge flee but the content
   of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) inside the microbial floc,
   which increased porosity of cake layer and thus enhanced the membrane
   flux. The flux increase in BAC sludge was more pronounced a with the
   increase in the nitrification extent. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We have shown experimentally that a diauxic lag can be exhibited when

   1. The new model accurately predicts oxygen and nitrate uptake, and
   portrays the growth pattern and diauxie. The model shows that diauxie
   occurs when the specific level of denitrifying enzyme is low at the
   outset of the anoxic phase, but does not occur if the specific level is
   initially high. The present work suggests that caution is needed in the
   application of conventional models for optimizing periodic processes for
   nitrogen removal, especially when the phase lengths considered are
   either much shorter or much longer than those tested under experimental

Abstract = {{This paper deals with settling velocities estimation, which is of major
   importance as settling velocities estimation is a prerequisite for
   properly dimensioning settling tanks. Several measurement procedures are
   presented and analyzed here. A general framework for identification
   which includes modelisation of the settlers and identification
   techniques is developed hers-in. In this paper, we demonstrate that for
   a parametric set of settling density functions rho(d nu) = Sigma(i=1)(N)
   theta(i)rho(i)(d nu) the mathematical relation between the measures
   M(t(i))(i)=(1,N) and the unknown quantities (theta(i))(i=1,N) take the
   following linear form M(t(i)) = Sigma(k=1)(N)
   theta(k)integral(R)phi(x)(t(i), nu)rho(k)(d nu) This relation makes it
   possible to have access to statistical errors in settling velocity
   estimates (theta(i)) in assuming that a statistical model of measurement
   errors (M(t(i))) exists. The consequences of the choice of sampling
   times (t(i))(i)=(1,N) on the quality of the estimation are also
   investigated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel method for the detection of specific microbes using the
   polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was developed and applied for
   the quantitative detection of Enterobacter cloacae strain HO-1 (HO-1,
   hereafter) in the experimental apparatus used for the treatment of
   wastewater containing hexavalent chromium (chromate). Note that HO-1 is
   capable of reducing toxic chromate to trivalent chromium. Based upon the
   preliminary experiments using pUC18 DNA, conditions giving a constant
   amplification rate of the targeted DNA with high reliability were
   determined for the quantitative detection of its initial concentration
   by the extrapolation. The cell density of HO-1 determined by the PCR
   technique was compared with the results counted on the selective medium
   agar plate conventionally used for the counting of HO-1. The procedure
   proposed here was successfully applied to estimate the cell density of
   Enterobacter cloacae HO-1 in the bioreactor for the treatment of
   chromate wastewater. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The typologies of three lakes located in northeast Brazil were studied
   during dry (summer) and wet (winter) seasons to choose a reduced number
   of parameters for quick and low cost monitoring of sanitary quality and
   trophic level of lentic waters in semiarid tropic regions. A total of 14
   parameters, commonly used for quality characterization (pH, temperature.
   turbidity dissolved oxygen, alkalinity, chloride, BOD5, ammonia,
   nitrate, total phosphorus, orthophosphate, fecal coliforms, fecal
   streptococci and chlorophyll ``a{''}) were measured in samples collected
   monthly during two years at 30 cm depth from litoral and limnetic zones.
   Principal components analysis showed that water typology was defined by
   9 variables grouped in two principal factors, related with algae biomass
   and with sanitary state/eutrophication level. Redundant parameters were
   discarded from those sets highly correlated with each factor and other
   original variable, preserving those with easier and economic techniques.
   Reducing variable numbers from 14 to 7 (fecal colifonns, turbidity,
   orthophosphate, nitrate, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, pH) and remaking the
   principal components analysis neither altered the definition of both
   principal factors nor reduced information about internal ecosystem
   dynamics. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A national survey of wastewater composition was conducted for 28
   chemical constituents from 15 treatment plants located across Tunisia to
   provide a basis for establishing water quality and management for crop
   production and environmental protection. The contents of salt, nutrients
   and trace elements were investigated and showed that the composition was
   characterized by a moderate salinity and sodicity for most of the
   plants, a high variability of the organic parameters, and a low trace
   elements content. In the case of N and P, such variations may be a
   constraint in using the water for fertilizing purposes. An increase in
   salinity with time was noticed for several plants. While the salt
   contents of wastewater were not affected by the treatment process, total
   N and P removal efficiencies were 48\% (62\% for ammonium) and 63\%.
   respectively. For trace elements, removals averaged: Zn 87\%; Cu and Fe
   78\%; Pb 64\%; Cr 50\%; Mn 44\%; Co and Cd 17\%; and Ni 13\%. The
   analyzed reclaimed water samples were consistent with the Tunisian
   standards regarding water quality required for agricultural reuse and
   had a high fertilizing content. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   Turkish clays namely Samas, Canbensan, Ceylan, Hasandede and Keskin in
   order to see their effects in clarifying the waste water before
   biopurification. The results showed that local clays (Hasandede and
   Keskin) are as efficient as bentonites (Samas, Canbensan and Ceylan).
   The clarifying efficiency of clays in combination with coagulants shows
   almost the same results of about 90\%. The effect of coagulants, FeCl3,
   FeSO4 and CaO, was similar to that obtained with Al-2(SO4)(3) The
   efficiency of polymeric materials especially cationic and anionic
   polymers was found to be better than that obtained with clays. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A batch culture of microorganisms can be classified to substrate-limited
   and substrate-sufficient growth according to the initial ratio of
   substrate to biomass, i.e. the S-0/X-0 ratio. It is generally observed
   that the excess substrate should cause serious uncoupling between
   anabolism and catabolism leading to energy spilling. However, how to
   quantitatively describe such energy uncoupling still slays unanswered
   for substrate-sufficient batch culture of activated sludge. Based on the
   observed growth yield, a concept of energy uncoupling coefficient is
   postulated, from which a model is proposed to describe the dependence of
   the energy uncoupling degree on the S-0/X-0 ratio for
   substrate-sufficient batch culture. The energy uncoupling shows an
   increasing trend with the S-0/X-0 ratio up to its maximum. The proposed
   model describes both experimental and literature data satisfactorily.

Abstract = {{Nonylphenol (NP) is considered to be a pseudo-estrogen and moreover is
   the most recalcitrant intermediate of the nonylphenol polyethoxylates.
   The latter are an important group of nonionic surfactants with worldwide
   applications. The behaviour and fate of nonylphenol during activated
   sludge treatment was studied using laboratory scale reactor units. It
   appeared that the NP added at concentrations of 8.33 mg/l was almost
   totally removed and biodegraded when the reactors were operated at 28
   degrees C. By lowering the temperature from 28 to 10-15 degrees C,
   elimination capacities decreased to 13-86\%, depending on the process
   conditions. Upon re-establishing the temperature at 28 degrees C, the
   accumulation of NP in the sludge could be counteracted. It was also
   demonstrated that the capacity of semi-continuous activated sludge
   (SCAS) to degrade NP was extended when the feed was made up with
   effluent from a full-scale activated sludge. Yet, the latter appeared
   also capable of rendering small amounts (20-100 mu gNP/g TSS) less
   bio-removable. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of a specialized physiological group, the so-called
   ``poly-P bacteria{''}, in activated sludge has been proposed to explain
   the uptake of organic carbon sources under anaerobic conditions and the
   cyclic release and uptake of phosphate in activated-sludge plants
   showing enhanced biological phosphate removal (EBPR). Members of the
   genus Acinetobacter have been considered to play a role in these
   processes, although their importance has been questioned. Indeed, the
   ability of Acinetobacter to alternately accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates
   under anaerobic conditions and polyphosphate under aerobic conditions
   has not been demonstrated. In this study, under aerobic batch-culture
   conditions, two strains of Acinetobacter which had been isolated from
   treatment plants exhibiting EBPR were shown to accumulate high levels of
   polyphosphate or a ``lipid{''} reserve which in one strain was
   identified as a polyhydroxyalkanoate. When cultured in a chemostat which
   allowed cyclic exposure to anaerobic and aerobic conditions, neither of
   the two strains showed release of phosphate or uptake of acetate under
   anaerobic conditions. These findings suggest that the behaviour of these
   strains does not conform to the usually accepted models for poly-P
   bacteria in EBPR systems. Nevertheless, strains of Acinetobacter which
   accumulate high levels of polyphosphate may still contribute to
   phosphate removal in EBPR systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Strong base ion-exchange resins Lewatit M 500 and Lewatit M 504 have
   steep ascending parts of isotherm curves in the range of low silver
   concentration in solution and can be used for silver extraction from
   plating rinsing effluents. Common elution methods are very inefficient
   for silver removal from strong base ion-exchange resins. Hence, the
   silver regeneration was performed by the electrolysis coupled elution
   process. During the process, the mass of silver deposited on the cathode
   and the I(t)-t curves were recorded. The electrolysis current was
   allowed to decrease to a value that corresponds to about 10\% of the
   silver capacity. This was achieved from Lewatit M 500 at -1.14 V
   electrolysis potential using the Pt cylinder gauze working electrode and
   at -1.30 V using the Ni cylinder working electrode and from Lewatit M
   504, at -1.10 V using the Pt cylinder gauze working electrode and at
   -1.19 V using the Ni cylinder electrode. During the first 3 h of the
   process 60-80\% of the silver can be removed. The desorption process
   depends on the hydrodynamic conditions provided between the resin beads
   and solution. It is possible to reuse Lewatit M 500 for the silver
   adsorption and desorption processes at least three times. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) was anaerobically reduced to 2,4-diaminotoluene
   (DAT) with either ethanol, methanol, acetic acid or hydrogen as the
   primary substrate. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests in an
   anaerobic respirometer indicate that 2,4-DNT was reductively
   biotransformed to 2,4-DAT via 4-amino-2-nitrotoluene (4-A-2-NT) or
   2-amino-4-nitrotoluene (2-A-4-NT) with either methanol, acetic acid or
   hydrogen as the primary substrate under anaerobic conditions as it was
   with ethanol as the primary substrate. However, the rate of 2,4-DNT
   biotransformation was much higher with ethanol as the primary substrate
   than that with either methanol or acetic acid as the primary substrate.
   Ethanol-enriched anaerobic culture was much better for the reductive
   biotransformation of 2,4-DNT than methanol- and acetate-enriched
   cultures when hydrogen was used as the primary substrate.
   Biotransformation of 2,4-DNT was not observed without any primary
   substrate. 2,4-DNT was not completely transformed to 2,4-DAT in the BMP
   tests unless enough ethanol was initially added to produce twice or more
   the hydrogen stoichiometrically needed for the reductive
   biotransformation. The addition of a high concentration of ethanol
   accelerated the reductive bibtransformation of 2,4-DNT. The presence of
   2,4-DNT, 4-A-2-NT and 2-A-4-NT inhibited the methanogeneses of methanol,
   acetate and hydrogen, as they did on the acetogenesis of ethanol. (C)

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the effects of sediment erosion and primary
   production on the temporal and spatial variability of heavy metals
   concentration in settling solids in the lakes IJsselmeer and Ketelmeer.
   Settling solids were sampled fortnightiy using sediment traps at two
   sites in the IJsselmeer and contents of clay, organic matter, calcium
   carbonate, six heavy metals and delta(13)C and delta(18)O values were
   measured. Wind speed and direction, suspended solids, organic matter,
   chlorophyll, phaeophytin and oxygen concentrations were measured in the
   water compartment, as was pH, temperature and Secchi depth. Regression
   and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the relationships within
   the data set. Principal components analysis and stepwise multiple
   regression Show that the variation in the heavy metals concentration in
   settling solids is related to the windspeed and clay content, both
   variables that are related to erosion of sediments; and to pH,
   chlorophyll and CaCO3, which are related to algal growth in the lake.
   This supports the hypothesis that the spatial gradient in the heavy
   metals concentrations in deposited solids in the IJsselmeer is the
   result of dilution of contaminated sediments due to erosion of older,
   less contaminated sediments and primary production related to algal
   growth. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{During a two years sampling campaign, water samples were taken in the
   Scheldt estuary between Antwerp and Vlissingen over a 94 km trajectory
   in order to measure concentrations of 13 volatile chlorinated C-1- and
   C-2-hydrocarbons and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Averaged
   concentrations proved to be in the 8 (CCl4) to 189 ng.l(-1)
   (tetrachloroethylene) range (n = 72). Concentrations were compared to
   other estuarine concentration data and to marine concentration data of
   the adjacent southern North Sea. The increasing concentration profiles
   towards Antwerp for a number of chlorinated compounds was explained by
   inputs at and/or upstream of Antwerp. Dilution with marine water and
   water to air transfer downstream of Antwerp are considered as the main
   factors which contribute to the decrease in concentration towards open
   sea. In a second part, modelling and estimation of the water to air
   exchange transfer was carried out based on the water column
   concentrations, atmospheric concentration data and available air/water
   exchange models. Calculated volatilization rates were between 0.1 (CCl4)
   and 8.6 tonnes.year(-1) (CHCl3). The significance of the amounts emitted
   was demonstrated by comparison with available data on anthropogenic
   emissions into surface waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Results of full-scale measurements of flow velocity and solids
   distribution in a circular secondary clarifier are presented and
   evaluated using numerical modelling. The flow velocity distribution was
   measured by means of an ultrasonic velocity profile monitor. A two phase
   three dimensional model was applied to gain a better understanding of
   the observed flow patterns. The calculation was carried out for a two
   dimensional field assuming axisymmetric conditions. The momentum,
   continuity and k-epsilon turbulence equations were solved. Solid
   transport equations for a coupled system were employed. Circulating
   currents were found by modelling and in practice. The full scale
   velocity components in radial direction as well as the solids
   distribution showed a satisfactory agreement to the predicted values. At
   the outer tank rim no settled sludge was predicted by modelling whereas
   a very thin sludge blanket was found in reality, however. It is assumed
   that conveyance of the settled sludge by the scraper has not been
   properly described for the very outer tank zone. The solids content at
   the rank bottom was around 12 g l(-1). The maximum radial velocity
   components varied in the range of 10 to 17 mm s(-1). High velocity
   components of up to 48 mm s(-1) towards the tank bottom were found in
   the inlet region. By numerical modelling those high numbers could not be
   matched. The calculated values were being in the range of 21 mm s(-1).

Abstract = {{Oxygen and deuterium isotopes were used as tracers to identify the
   rainwater and pre-storm water components of storm runoff in the Cedar
   River Watershed of northeastern Iowa, U.S.A. Instantaneously discharged
   water in the main channel, the Cedar River, showed steady chemical
   characteristics during the storm event. Hydrograph separation by oxygen
   and deuterium isotopes demonstrated that the discharge water
   predominantly consisted of ground water (83\%). It suggested that the
   Cedar River is in good hydrologic connections with the upper bedrock
   aquifer. The rainwater effectively infiltrated into the subsurface
   forcing the contaminated ground water to discharge into the main
   channel. In contrast, the Dry Run Creek, a tributary of the Cedar River,
   demonstrated increased dominance of overland flow. The water in the
   creek was considerably impacted by the rain event through dilution, and
   the instantaneously discharged water predominantly consisted of
   rainwater (54\%). The remaining 46\% was the subsurface water derived
   from the shallow alluvial aquifers of sand and gravel deposits. The Dry
   Run Creek is in hydrologic connections with the alluvial aquifers only,
   and the less significance of pre-storm water in the creek is attributed
   to the discontinuous nature of the sand and gravel deposits in the
   valley area. This isotopic investigation demonstrated that the origin of
   water components in storm runoff and its geochemical evolution can vary
   considerably from channel to channel within the same watershed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Surface sediments from two shallow, eutrophic Swedish lakes with
   different sediment BD-P (Fe-P) content, bur similar NH4Cl-P (e.g. pore
   water P) concentration were treated with different amounts of aluminum
   sulphate at pH 6 in the laboratory to simulate the recommended dose for
   in-lake alum treatments. NH4Cl-P was depleted with less than half the
   recommended dose of Al in Lake Vallentuna sediments that contained a low
   concentration (0.1 mg P g(-1) DW) of BD-P. Lake Finja, on the other
   hand, with high concentration of BD-P (2.3 mg P g(-1) DW), required
   three limes the recommended Al dose to deplete NH4Cl-P, indicating that
   BD-P correlated with NH4Cl-P. Six times the recommended Al-dose
   converted all BD-P (Fe-P) to NaOH-rP (Al-P) under anoxic conditions in
   the BD-P rich sediment, while one dose was enough in Lake Vallentuna.
   Other P-pools, defined by P-fractionations, remained constant. In order
   to simulate a summer resuspension event, sediments were placed In
   ``resuspension chamber{''} through which oxygen-saturated water with pH
   9.5 passed at 100 cm day(-1). The iron-rich sediment released 1 mg BD-P
   g(-1) DW of an initial 2.3 mg BD-P g(-1) DW after one day. With addition
   of 90 mg Al g(-1) DW (6 x recommended dose) the subsequent release when
   resuspended was only 0.25 mg P g(-1) DW after one day, showing a general
   increase in P retention capacity with large doses of Al. It is concluded
   that by transforming all Fe-P to Al-P in surface sediments, this should
   drastically reduce internal loading of P caused by anoxic hypolimnetic
   water. Thus, the burial rate of potentially mobile P in accumulation
   sediments would increase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of monochlorophenols (MCPs) on volatile Fatty acid
   degradation by methanogenic granular sludge from two full scale upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors treating potato processing
   wastewater, were tested. Sludges 1 and 2 were derived from the first
   reactor, and sludge 3 from the second reactor. Methane production and
   utilization of acetate, propionate and butyrate were measured. Methane
   production by sludge 3 was more severely inhibited by MCPs (50\%
   inhibition around 0.6 mM or less) than were sludges 1 and 2 (50\%
   inhibition above 1 mM). Aceticlastic methanogens, propionate degrading
   consortia and butyrate degrading consortia of the two sludges had a
   different sensitivity. In sludge 3, the acetate utilization was most
   sensitive, While for the other sludges, butyrate utilization was
   inhibited most strongly. In an experiment with stored sludge, the
   inhibition was reversible, but depended on the exposure time. In
   addition, stored sludge was less active and more sensitive to MCPs
   compared to fresh sludge. An activation period after cold storage
   lowered the sensitivity of the sludge to 2-CP. These findings may be
   important when stored sludge is used to start up a reactor to treat
   wastewater that contains toxic compounds. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{The efficiency of nano filtration (NF) in producing drinking water from
   two types of humic ground waters was studied on site at a pilot scale in
   Denmark. At one site, the natural organic matter (NOM) consisted almost
   entirely of humic acids with a concentration of 20-22 mg C/l, a broad
   molecular weight distribution and a large fraction of high molecular
   weight NOM. At the other site, the initial NOM concentration was 7-11 mg
   C/l with 60\% of the NOM as fulvic acids and a narrow molecular weight
   distribution around 2000 D. A spiral wound NF membrane with a nominal
   molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of 200-500 D and a feed spacer of 0.75
   mm in diamond configuration demonstrated superior NOM removal for both
   waters. Membrane productivity decline was observed due to the
   accumulation of NOM on the membrane surface or the precipitation of
   inorganic salts such as calcite (CaCO3), dependent upon NOM and
   inorganic water chemistry types. Accumulated NOM was removed with an
   alkaline detergent recovering the initial membrane productivity by 90\%,
   whereas the inorganic precipitation was removed with an acidic detergent
   followed by the alkaline detergent, recovering the initial productivity
   completely. A spiral wound NF membrane with a nominal MWCO of 180 D and
   a feed spacer of 1.25 mm in parallel configuration exhibited the same
   product water quality, but a higher and more stable membrane
   productivity than the first membrane. High cross flow and low operating
   pressure reduced the membrane productivity decline. Nanofiltration of
   humic ground water resulted in efficient removal of NOM and a stable
   productivity, if differences in NOM and inorganic raw water composition
   were considered in designing the nanofiltration process. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Three pure culture assays for measurements of inhibition of the nitrogen
   removal process were tested and compared. The methods were performed
   using pure cultures of bacteria responsible for three reactions; ammonia
   oxidation, nitrite oxidation and nitrite reduction. The inhibition
   caused by 48 samples of industrial wastewater was determined and the
   results for the three inhibition assays were compared. The correlation
   coefficients were calculated to be between 0.63 and 0.73. The inhibition
   of the pure culture methods was also compared with results from another
   investigation, where the inhibition by the same wastewaters was
   determined by a screening method based on activated sludge. The best
   correlation was found with the ammonia oxidation assay. The heavy metal
   content was statistically analysed for relationships with inhibition
   using a linear model with stepwise linear regression. Although zinc was
   a significant inhibitor for all three methods, these responded
   differently in the second step, which indicate that the bacteria are not
   inhibited according to the same pattern. The relevance of the three pure
   culture assays as an inhibition test is discussed and the conclusion can
   be drawn that they are all needed to give a complete inhibition picture
   of wastewaters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The pathway by which ozone reacts with pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon (PAH), is proposed in this paper. Pyrene was dissolved in a
   90\% acetonitrile:water (v/v) mixture. At this ratio, sufficient water
   is present to participate in the ozonolysis reaction and thereby mimic
   what occurs in pure water. The initial pyrene concentration was 5 mM.
   The ozone dosages were varied to obtain different extents of reaction. A
   stoichiometric ratio of 1.68 mol ozone mol(-1) pyrene was required to
   completely destroy pyrene. The ozonation products were tentatively
   identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fourteen
   products including aldehyde and carboxylic acid substituted
   phenanthrene- and biphenyl-type oxidation products were identified.
   Several ring-cleavage reactions occurred sequentially: (i) ring cleavage
   of pyrene first occurred at the 4,5 position, with phenanthrene-type
   products predominating; and (ii) once secondary ring cleavage occurred,
   the concentration of pyrene and the phenanthrene-type products,decreased
   dramatically, while the concentration of biphenyl-type products
   increased. The oxidation of pyrene by hydroxyl free radicals was found
   to be involved in the reaction, even at pH 3.7. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An anaerobic microbial consortium developed in our laboratory showed

   were used as carbon and energy sources. Highly chlorinated congeners
   (containing >5 chlorines) such as penta-, hexa- and heptachlorobiphenyls
   were preferentially dechlorinated both in the presence and the absence
   of sediment with a simultaneous change in the distribution of relative
   amounts of tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyl congeners. The dechlorination
   pattern and rates observed in both sediment and sediment-free conditions
   were similar. In 24 weeks, almost 70\% of the PCBs were dechlorinated
   without accumulation of any specific PCB congeners. Monochlorobiphenyls
   were dechlorinated at a higher rate than di- and tetrachlorobiphenyls.

Abstract = {{Various aqueous systems produced by different technologies can contain
   Mn(II) in the concentration range of 50 divided by 1000 mg x l(-1),
   which represents a pollution source but also can be used for the
   separation-recovery of useful compounds. The present paper presents the
   results of the researches concerning Mn(II) recovery from ``model{''}
   and real aqueous systems by the precipitate flotation method, dissolved
   air flotation (DAF) variant, with izoalkylcarboxillic acid as collector.
   The following influencing factors were studied: pH, collector
   concentration, metallic ion concentration, necessary gas flow and foam
   processing with Mn(II) recovery as oxide. The separation mechanism by
   the collector-Mn(II) interaction at optimal conditions is also studied.
   Therefore, a correlation of chemical analysis results with electronic
   and vibrational spectra and thermal analysis is made. The results of the
   experimental data plead for the recovery separation of Mn(II) from
   aqueous systems and its recovery as oxide after thermal decomposition of
   the species contained in the foam. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{As the sanitary landfill dumping of the lipidic residues are now
   prohibited by French legislation. new treatment ways such as
   biodegradation or incineration have to be developed. This work carried
   out on domestic grease demonstrates the effect of their saponification
   on their aerobic biodegradation. The composition of the lipidic residues
   mixture used in this work and collected from a wastewater plant was
   characterized (70\% dry matter, 90\% HEM, 80\% of free and esterified
   fatty acids, 20\% of other lipidic materials, DCO/lipids = 2.4). Both
   the solubilization of grease (apparent CMC = 0.7 g HEM/l) and their
   micellization by saponification highly enhanced the rate of grease
   degradation by an activated sludge. This pointed out that the
   elimination reaction was controlled by the grease transfer from lipidic
   phase to cell. During batch culture (X-0 = 1.8 g MLSS/l, S-0 = 3.5 g
   HEM/l), the degradation rate was more than 0.2 g HEM/l/h and the removal
   yield was 60\% for HEM, namely 70\% for fatty acids and 40\% for
   unsaponifiable compounds. This low removal yield could be linked to the
   high foaming onset which did not allow the biological degradation
   reaction to continue. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{All attempts to model a wastewater treatment process necessarily require

   equations with the results of dye tracer experiments conducted on more
   than thirty existing facilities to determine which pond characteristics
   influence the flow pattern. It concludes by suggesting new dispersion
   prediction formulas that relate Peclet number values to aerator power

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3046-3054}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The accumulation of organic matter (OM) was investigated after two and
   five years in a series of four gravel-bed constructed wetlands supplied
   with different hydraulic loading rates (21, 26, 46 and 72 mm d(-1)) of
   farm dairy wastewaters. At these hydraulic loadings, mean wastewater
   loadings of particulate OM (determined as volatile suspended solids) to
   the wetlands ranged between similar to 1.7 and 5.8 g m(.)(-2)d(.)(-1)
   Vertical and horizontal gradients of OM accumulation, measured by ``loss
   on ignition{''}, were sampled by stratified coring at 18 sites in each
   wetland, and their impact on wastewater residence times investigated in
   three of the wetlands using bromide as a conservative tracer. Mean
   accumulations of OM in the wetlands after five years operation ranged
   between 6.8 and 14.9 kg m(-2), increasing with wastewater loading rate.
   The annual rates of accumulation during the first two years were 1.2 to
   2-fold higher than those in the subsequent three years. Around 50-60\%
   of the OM occurred within the gravel substratum, the remainder forming
   surface sludges, commonly exceeding 50 mm depth over much of the wetland
   substratum. OM accumulation in the wetlands considerably exceeded that
   contributed from applied wastewaters, with wetland plant derived
   detritus supplying substantial additional quantities of OM. The
   effective void space of the wetland substrata was markedly reduced in
   the highest loaded wetland, with mean wastewater retention time reduced
   to similar to 50\% of its theoretical value (corrected for
   evapotranspiration losses). In contrast, the lowest-loaded wetland
   exhibited retention times close to theoretical values. There was,
   however, no direct relationship between OM accumulation and the
   effective retention times of the wetlands, suggesting other factors,
   such as differences in OM bulk density, spatial patterns of accumulation
   and plant root growth, and inorganic accumulations, were also
   influencing their hydrology. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A medium-scale (51) reactor was designed for the purification of
   metal-containing wastewater discharged by academical chemical
   laboratories. The process is based on the precipitation of metals in
   alkaline solution as metal-bearing ferrites of high magnetic
   permeability, which can be later used in a variety of applications based
   in their magnetic properties. Chemical variables affecting the process
   efficiency were optimized in a previous work and fixed here at their
   optimum values (pH, 10; Fe(II):Total metal molar ratio, 15). Operational
   variables or control factors were optimized using a Taguchi parameter
   design in order to achieve maximum efficiency of the purification
   process (or minimum total remnant cationic concentration, TRCC), and a
   solid waste (ferrite sludge) of maximum magnetic permeability, which
   allows its use in a variety of applications. The interference caused by
   metal-binding organic matter present in the wastewater was investigated
   introducing in the optimization experiment a three-level noise factor in
   order to find control factor levels that yield optimum process
   performance, insensitive to the uncontrollable variation of this noise.
   EDTA (disodium salt) was used as model for the noise factor. The effects
   of temperature, air flow and stirrer rate were moderate. It was observed
   that the presence of high concentrations of metal-binding organic matter
   hinders metal precipitation in such a way that EDTA concentrations
   higher than 10(-3) M decrease purification efficiencies below 99\%.
   Under the optimized conditions (reaction time, 1 h; temperature, 60
   degrees C; air flow, 30 l/min; and stirrer rate, 560 rpm), and for
   concentrations of metal-binding organic matter below 10(-3) M, a
   purification efficiency of 99.9\% and a chemically stable (inert)
   ferrite sludge of relative magnetic permeability 83.60 (66.6\% of the MP
   value for pure magnetite) are obtained. The procedure is therefore
   recommended for purification of metal-containing wastewater. The
   chemical reactions involved in the process are discussed. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The adsorption isotherm of As(III) on copper impregnated activated
   carbon was obtained in a batch reactor. Various parameters such as
   reaction time, adsorbent dose, initial concentration of adsorbate, pH,
   and temperature were studied to establish optimum conditions. Maximum
   adsorption capacity was observed at pH 12.0. The adsorption isotherm was
   also affected by temperature since the adsorption capacity was increased
   by raising the temperature from 30 to 60 degrees C. The experimental
   adsorption data fitted reasonably well to the Langmuir isotherm. The
   mass transfer coefficients as a function of initial sorbate
   concentration have been determined. Arsenic(III) can be successfully
   removed from synthetic and industrial wastewaters. Desorption studies
   revealed that spent adsorbent can be regenerated and reused by 30\% H2O2
   in 0.5 M HNO3. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   on laboratory scale using gas and mechanical stirring. Under external

   following equations: for air under the conditions 60 < Q < 200 cm(3)/s:
   E = 7.545Q(1.116)X(8.43) and for mechanical stirring under the
   conditions 330 < N < 1035 rpm: E = 29.288N(1.197)X(6.5). The study shows
   that the energy consumption was substantially lower for air stirring,

Abstract = {{Solutions of various concentrations of NO2-, NO3- or SO42-, and equal

   distilled water as well as in samples of industrial waster-water
   effluents of Kima company (a factory producing ammonium nitrate coated
   with limestone powder Fertilizer) at Aswan City and River Nile water
   collected from Mansoura, Damietta, Kafr el Zayat and Edfina were tested
   against Bacillus Stearothermophilus Asw 88 and Bacillus
   Stearothermophilus Asw 129 and autoclaved at 37 and 50 degrees C for
   various hours using nutrient yeast extract (NYE) medium. Detection and
   assay of NO2-, NO3- and SO42- in simple salt solutions using NaNO2,
   NaNO3, Na2SO4 and H2SO4 after screening for 120 h indicates complete
   depletion of these components as they are good and convenient essential
   nutrient sources for both strains utilized safely for the treatment of
   polluted water. The strains are not pathogenic and they have no
   hazardous effect on human and animal life. The method is efficient and
   the results of the analysed water samples are consistent with the
   permissible safety baseline levels desired for domestic, irrigation and
   industrial purposes and also for drinking purposes after disinfection
   according to the World Health Organisation Standards. Complete depletion
   of SO42- after 96 h, NO2- and NO3- after 144 h, COD after 168 h and
   23-30\% degradation of Cl- after 168 hi are obtained. The biological
   treatment of industrial wastewater effluents of Kima Company and River
   Nile water at Damietta, Mansoura, Edfina, and Kafr El Zayat containing
   NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, HCO3-, Cl- and COD (organic matter) shows a
   progressive biodegradation of nutrients' levels with time, reaching
   complete depletion (NO2-, NO3-, SO42- and COD) due to the degradation
   effect by nitrogen and sulphur reducing bacteria. The decrease or
   absence (depletion) of nutrients and other parameters' levels may be
   related to their consumption by bacterial biomass. (C) 1998 Elsevier

   system without duckweed to find out which role duckweed played during
   the degradation of organic material. Removal of COD was significantly
   faster in the presence of duckweed. Removal efficiencies after 3 d were
   74-78\% in duckweed-covered treatments compared to 52-60\% in uncovered
   controls. DOC levels remained constant and were similar in axenic and
   non-axenic duckweed-covered systems, suggesting that heterotrophic
   uptake of smaller organic compounds by duckweed was not important.
   Degradation of organic material was enhanced by duckweed through both
   additional oxygen supply and additional surface for bacterial growth.
   The structure of attached bacterial communities and the way oxygen was
   supplied appear important. because the influence of the living duckweed
   community could not be simulated satisfactorily by artificial surfaces
   for bacterial growth, by oxygen pumps or by a combination of both. (C)

Abstract = {{The MPN has been traditionally calculated on the basis of MPN tables of
   two different dilution schemes and thus the bacterial density estimation
   has been restricted to follow either of the above schemes. However, the
   use of a computer program may allow the use of any dilution scheme and
   at the same time make it unnecessary to ambiguously truncate the output
   result to three. On the other hand, it is well known that the MPN can be
   calculated with any output quantum irrespective of how improbable the
   quantum may be. Thus, the improbability should be estimated also in the
   computer work. In the present study, the direct use of ``cut-off
   probability{''} as the measure of improbability is newly proposed on the
   basis that any quantum having maximum likelihood less than the
   probability can be regarded as improbable. The cut-off probability at
   the traditional erroneous rejection level of at most 1\% was computed
   and then formulated into an equation applicable with some common
   dilution schemes. Furthermore, a static measure deviance was clarified
   to have limited availability and therefore be erroneous if used in
   general through comparison of the measure with the cut-off probability.

Abstract = {{In a ``large-scale-catchment-manipulation-research-project{''}, a
   dystrophic lake was divided into two halves by means of a plastic
   curtain, from the middle of the natural outlet to the opposite shore.
   Since fall 1990, one lake half and the corresponding catchment has been
   sprinkled with artificial acid precipitation, while the other was left
   untouched. The catchment acidification experiment took place in an area
   of Norway receiving little acid rain. During a few day period in October
   1994, after four years of acidification, the natural organic matter
   (NOM) from 22701 of water was isolated from each of the two sides of the
   lake, using the following sequential technique: coarse filtration:
   exchange of cations with Na+; concentrate organic solutes from 22701 of
   water to 701 by means of reverse osmosis membranes; filtration of the
   701 through 0.45 mu m membranes; concentration to 4-51 by evaporation at
   low pressure and at 30 degrees C; freeze drying (yield 70-75 g). Small
   portions of both isolates (100-200 mg) were distributed to a number of
   different laboratories in Europe and North America for analyses.
   Characteristic data, such as distribution of ions, proton- and copper
   binding capacity, content of metals, content of organic S, organic N,
   free- and hydrolysable amino acids are reported here. A number of
   analytical techniques were used, including UV-VIS, IR and fluorescence
   spectrophotometry, C-13 NMR; pyrolysis, GC/MS and HPLC. Studies on
   adsorption- and flocculation abilities of the two ``water qualities{''}
   and formation of trihalomethanes (THM) upon chlorination, is also
   included. The results from 10 different laboratories are presented and
   similarities and differences between the two semi-identical samples are
   discussed. Some studies of the consequence of the isolation step on the
   quality of the NOM, are also discussed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Laboratory studies with continuous-flow columns containing aquifer
   material were conducted to evaluate the potential of sorption and
   biodegradation of halogenated organic compounds (AOX) and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) in tertiary effluents during soil-aquifer treatment
   (SAT). To improve water quality, powdered activated carbon (PAC)
   treatment and the use of ozone were also investigated. Batch experiment
   results indicated that sorption processes are not significant concerning
   DOC and AOX removal in SAT. Biodegradation of DOC during SAT can be
   described by a first-order macroscopic kinetic model. However, 65\% of
   DOC was not biodegradable during SAT. These refractory compounds are
   similar to humic and fulvic acids and are probably formed in the
   activated sludge treatment or are present already in the drinking water
   which has a DOC level of 3-5 mg l(-1). The elimination of AOX under
   anoxic conditions is probably based on cometabolism. Poorly degradable
   DOC does function as a cosubstrate in AOX-cometabolism and it is likely
   that further AOX-degradation will occur until local background
   concentration are reached. PAC (100 g m(-3) W-35, Norit Co.)
   preferentially adsorbed refractory, high molecular weight fractions and
   up to 50\% of the AOX concentration in tertiary effluent was reduced.
   Ozone treatment (0.86 and 1.89 g O-3 g(-1) DOC0) improved the
   biodegradability of refractory organic compounds and cosubstrate
   concentration for AOX-cometabolism in subsequent SAT. This research
   concludes, that refractory DOC is more important in soil-aquifer
   treatment systems than AOX compounds, commonly considered to be of
   greater concern. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sorption coefficients of a series of hydrophobic organic compounds were
   determined for two sediments, one with a high (RDD sediment) and one
   with a low organic carbon content (OVP sediment). The chemicals were
   administered to water using a generator column, or using one of the
   following carriers (0.5\%, v/v): acetone, methanol or propanol. In
   addition to the influence of the mode of administration, the influence
   of the bactericide, sodium azide (NaN3), on the sorption coefficients
   was studied. For most compounds, higher sorption coefficients were found
   in RDD sediment than in OVP sediment. Only for the most hydrophobic
   compounds no large differences were found between the sorption
   coefficients in the two sediments. In RDD sediment, the use of the
   carriers showed lower sorption coefficients for almost all compounds,
   and in OVP sediment the use of the carrier showed only for some of the
   more hydrophobic compounds lower sorption coefficients, than the use of
   the generator column. The highest dry weight (DW) and total organic
   carbon (TOC) concentrations were found in the aqueous phase of the high
   organic carbon sediment (RDD). In addition, methanol and propanol
   resulted in significant increases in TOC concentrations. The influence
   of DW and TOC concentrations on the sorption coefficients could,
   however, not be quantified. Since carriers may have a significant effect
   on the experimental determination of sorption coefficients, we suggest
   to use the generator column for administering the compounds, in
   combination with a bactericide to prevent bacterial activity. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The present study deals with the analysis of fecundity in Daphnia magna

   possibility of predicting Fecundity values over the long term on the
   basis of growth values recorded early in the toxicity test. The results
   based on data from toxicity tests with pyridine, cadmium and chromium
   (the last at two different food levels), indicate that such predictions
   are practicable, since the relationship between growth and fecundity is
   strong and robust under the experimental conditions employed. Damaging
   effects of toxicants on fecundity over 21 d (the usual length of the
   Daphnia magna chronic toxicity tests) and/or longer, can be derived from
   body length recorded in shorter exposure to toxicants. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Title = {{Hydrodynamics of a biological unsaturated filtration system with
   nitrification of a septic effluent}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3157-3167}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamics of a biological unsaturated filtration system with
   nitrification of a septic effluent: Most of the on site waste-water
   treatment plant designed by means of empirical relations, do not answer
   to the European quality guideline for waste-water effluent. Furthermore,
   the classical process based on a pretreatment combining settling and
   liquefaction of suspended solids followed by an aerobic filtration in
   natural or artificial soil beds is a source of nitrate. Recently,
   process implementing a saturated bed filter (denitrificant reactor) and
   a streaming filter (nitrificant reactor) removed nitrates efficiently
   (Rousselle, 1990, Doctorate Thesis, University of Chambery, France;
   Cochet et al., 1990; Wat. Sci. Tech. 22, 109-116). The denitrification
   filter is located upstream of the nitrification filter and the effluent
   is recirculated in order to achieve the denitrification process without
   any extra carbon source. The purpose of this work is in a first stage to
   study the hydrodynamics of the unsaturated reactor and in a second stage
   to determine the kinetic constants of carbon removal and ammonia
   oxidation. These two parts are necessary for establishing the functional
   equations of this kind of process. The hydrodynamic description of this
   type of reactor is discussed in the first part of this work. Material
   and methods: Hydraulic loads applied at the inlet reactors were from
   0.41 to 54 cm h(-1). For continuous flow reactor, the column had a 0.20
   or 0.30 m diameter for hydrodynamic study and 0.09 m for nitrification
   constants determination. Kinetic investigations were performed in a
   batch reactor including a filtering column which is linked to an
   effluent tank (Fig. 1). The pulsed periodic flows were obtained with an
   inlet flow during 5 min h(-1). Pulse technique was used for the
   determination of reactor behaviour. Fresh water applied at a given rate
   was enriched with a potassium iodide tracer impulse. The iodide
   concentration measurements are done at the outlet of the packed bed.
   Various flow rates were tested to understand the hydrodynamic behaviour.
   The filtering media used in these investigations was a mixture of sand
   and flocks textile. Tableau 1 reports the characteristics of this
   filtering media. Hydrodynamic studies were carried out for both
   permanent flow and pulsed periodic flow. A first approach of residence
   time was obtained with a theoretical equation including the thickness of
   the liquid film (equations 27-29). Results were close to those
   determined from the experimental residence time distribution (RTD)
   except for the high values. The unsaturated flow in the nitrification
   reactor was described with a two phase flow (stagnant and dynamic) with
   initial and limit closed reactor conditions. Transformation of the
   coupled equations system in Laplace domain leads to a transfer function
   which can be defined as the ratio of the Laplace transform of the output
   divided by the Laplace transform of the input. Three parameters are
   defined in this matter exchange with dispersed flow model (EMD model).
   P, N, f, represent respectively dispersion in dynamic flow (Peclet
   number), number of transfer units and ratio of dynamic phase volume
   divided by total volume of two phases. Unsaturated flow could be well
   represented by EMD model (Tableau 3). Model parameters (P and f) were
   not significantly affected by hydraulic load variation. For a pulsed
   periodical flow the filtering media behaves as a flow shock adsorber.
   For a 0.95 m packed bed, the outlet flow was in steady state conditions.
   Residence time distributions are well described by EMD model. (Tableau
   5).
   Kinetics studies: Elimination reaction of ammonia occurs with order 0
   and it is about equal to 4-4.5 mg L-1 h(-1). For COD, results are in
   agreement with a first order reaction with a constant equal to 0.12-0.14
   h(-1). Experiments with different preliminary functioning durations were
   carried out: 2, 6, 12 months (Tableau 6). After six months of operating,
   kinetic constants was stable. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A simple method for determination of fatty acids (C-8-C-22) in
   wastewater, extracted with dichloromethane. was developed. The
   extraction time was drastically reduced using ultrasound. Fatty acids
   were esterified using BF3 methanolic solution followed by an 11 min run
   using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with selected ion monitoring
   (GC/MS-SIM). A clean-up is not necessary using SIM Mode. Tridecanoic
   acid was used as a surrogate internal standard. Detection limits go from
   0.008 to 0.016 mg l(-1). The applicable concentration range was 0.010 to
   10 mg l(-1). The method was validated by using the Standard Addition
   Methodology and it was applied satisfactorily to wastewater From Granada

Abstract = {{This note outlines a method for measuring polymer residuals in an alum
   sludge on the basis of size exclusion chromatography (SEC). In our
   approach we established reference standards of polymer in a sludge
   supernatant and compared the derived chromatogram with that of the
   supernatant alone, this allowing us to clearly distinguish the polymer
   response from the response of the supernatant in the samples. Much of
   the work focused on a nonionic polymer using nanopure water as the
   mobile phase for the SEC. Later tests showed that the techniques, which
   were developed, could be applied to a wider variety of polymers using a
   0.8 M sodium sulphate solution as the mobile phase. All polymers
   examined were excluded without interfering chromatographic mechanisms
   and the method could handle about 12 samples per hour. In the context of
   an alum sludge being conditioned with a nonionic polymer, the
   polymer-sludge interaction was characterised by an apparent adsorption
   isotherm. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality managers traditionally assess the illness risk associated
   with indicator bacteria in bathing waters by comparing an average
   concentration to a concentration standard, where the average may be
   determined from a frequency distribution of concentrations. The United
   States EPA concentration standards are determined as the concentration
   which gives an acceptable illness rate according to a mathematical
   relation between the concentration and illness rate
   (concentration-response relation). However, Further use can be made of
   the frequency distribution and concentration-response relation. This
   paper presents a method for combining the temporal concentration
   frequency distribution with a concentration-response relation to obtain
   the averaged illness rate (that is, the expected illness rate). First
   the method is developed for the concentration frequency distribution at
   a single location. The method is also extended for the case where the
   temporal concentration frequency distribution is known at a number of
   points throughout the area in the vicinity of the outfall, in which case
   spatial contours of averaged illness rate can be determined. The methods
   are demonstrated for a site at the North Shore, New Zealand. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A new method of evaluation of scale inhibitors efficiency has been

   measurement. It consists of determining a supersaturation level of any
   scale forming compound in a given water, at defined conditions, in the
   presence of a specified amount of scale inhibitor and also without
   inhibitor. This method allows the stabilizing features of compounds
   under investigation to be differentiated. With this method the
   efficiency of preventing CaCO3 precipitation from aqueous solutions was
   determined for three phosphonate compounds which are effective as
   corrosion inhibitors of mild steel in neutral water:
   2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid (TBTC),
   ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid (EDTMP) and
   phosphono-N-methylenephosphonic derivative of polycaproamide (PMPP). It
   was ascertained that the above compounds are effective in preventing
   CaCO3 crystallization from water. EDTMP showed the best stabilizing
   properties and PBTC what poorer ones. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This work explores the role of the raw water matrix, particularly
   natural organic matter (NOM), in determining the removal of atrazine by
   nanofiltration membranes. The nature and relative concentration of NOM,
   the presence of calcium and ionic strength affected atrazine rejection.
   Dissolved organic matter (DOM) enhanced atrazine rejection in most cases
   and was dependent upon the relative concentrations of the DOM and the
   atrazine and the ionic strength. Atrazine rejection was greatly enhanced
   in the presence of the NOM surrogate, tannic acid. Less enhancement of
   atrazine rejection by NOM in comparison with tannic acid is attributed
   to relatively high concentrations of cations in the raw water and NOM
   concentrate and difference in molecular weight distribution Higher ionic
   strengths decreased atrazine rejection. Trends in atrazine rejection as
   a function of recovery suggest that free atrazine rejection is mass
   transport-limited. Atrazine associated with DOM is removed by mechanical
   sieving. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Performance of common duckweed species (Lemnaceae) and the waterfern
   Azolla filiculoides on different types of waste water}},

Abstract = {{The growth of five duckweed species (Lemna gibba L., Lemna minor L.,
   Lemna trisulca L., Spirodela polyrhiza (I.) Schleiden and Wolffa arrhiza
   (L.) Hork. ex Wimm.). and one waterfern (Azolla filiculoides Lamk.) was
   assessed in laboratory scale experiments comparing domestic sewage and
   two types of artificial waste water with a standard mineral growth
   medium (1/10 Huttner). Across the three waste waters, organic loading
   varied between 300 and 442 mg l(-1) GOD, total Kjeldahl-N varied between
   14 and 52 mg N l(-1) and total-P between 7 and 9 mg P l(-1). All species
   yielded less on the two artificial waste waters than on the mineral
   medium. In contrast, in domestic waste water Lemna gibba and Spirodela
   polyrhiza performed equally well compared td the mineral medium (RGR on
   Huttner 0.27 +/- 0.01 and 0.15 +/- 0.02, respectively). In a Subsequent
   12 days batch experiment with Lemna gibba in presented domestic waste
   water, a detailed mass balance was established for the two
   macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). The duckweed
   was,subjected to a harvesting regime: every fourth day the density was
   reduced to the initial 17 g dry weight m(-2). Total-P was reduced to 2.4
   +/- 0.2 mg P l(-1) (77\% removal) and Kjeldahl-N to 6.2 +/- 0.4 mg N
   l(-1) (94\% removal). The P-balance accounted for 93\% of the inputs and
   56\% was removed by the duckweed. Also periphyton contributed
   substantially to P removal (18\%). For N, however, 50\% of the inputs
   was unaccounted. Although a nitrification inhibitor was applied, it is
   concluded that this must have been ineffective, since most of. the
   N-loss occurred in the first part of the experiment, when pH was still
   too low (pH < 8) for substantial NH3-volatilization. Hence,
   nitrification/denitrification is held responsible for 50\% of the
   nitrogen removal from the system, the-harvested duckweed accounted for
   34\%. Tn short, denitrification was the major pathway for N-removal and
   duckweed absorption for P-removal. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   delayed fluorescence to chlorophyll a concentration (DF/chlorophyll) in
   samples collected from Lake Kinneret, Israel, fluctuated throughout the
   investigation period; which covered the annual broom of the
   dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense. The DF/chl ratio increased with the
   initiation of Peridinium population build up, reached the highest value
   when the algal bloom reached its peak and declined with the decrease of
   algal density. DF intensity was positively correlated with the primary
   productivity at the depth of maximal productivity, indicating that DF
   intensity may be used as a rapid probe of this variable. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The adsorptive characteristics of ionogenic pesticides on powdered
   activated carbon were described. The effects of pH on the
   adsorbabilities of MCPB (an acidic pesticide) and imazalil (a basic
   pesticide) onto-powdered activated carbon (PAC) were evaluated by
   correlating I-octanol-water partition coefficients (log P-ow) with the
   Freundlich adsorption constants over a pH range of 3 similar to 9. After
   being corrected with pH, the Values of log P-ow were found to be
   linearly related to the logarithm of k (i.e. log k). For MCPB, log k as
   well as log P-ow decreased with the increase of pH in the range of pH >
   pK(a) and became constant in the range of pH < pK(a) and vise versa for
   imazalil. Adsorption of ionic species ante PAC became negligible at an
   ionic strength of similar to 10(-3) M when pH-pK(a) was lower than 4 for
   MCPB and pH-pK(a) higher than -4 for imazalil. Similar relationship
   between log k and log - P-ow was obtained for other four acidic
   pesticides (bentazone, :pentachlorophenol, denoseb and MCPP) and two
   neutral pesticides (imidacloprid and linuron), which suggested that the
   log P-ow values mainly determined the adsorbabilities of these
   pesticides onto PAC. The calculation results showed that the activated
   carbon amount needed (ACAN) for lowering pesticide concentration from
   500 to 50 mu g/l was also linearly related to log P-ow, and the ACAN for
   bentazone(log P-ow, 0.11 at pH = 7) Was 51.9 mg/l, while that for
   imazalil (log P-ow, 3.80 at pH = 8.0)was 3.1 mg/l. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of design criteria
   and environmental conditions of the site of created tidal flats, on the
   structure and function of the man-made ecosystem. Seven constructed
   tidal hats and three natural tidal flats were studied taking into
   consideration: the difference in the location (wave height and tidal
   current), inflow of river water, slope of tidal flat and age after the
   construction was completed. Parameters studied were physico-chemical and
   biological characteristics of soils and rate of respiration. The natural
   tidal hats had higher contents of silt, nitrogen and organic matter
   compared to the constructed ones. The natural ones had a reductive zone
   below 2 cm, whereas the constructed ones had an aerobic zone from the
   surface to below 20 cm. The bacterial population in the soil of the
   constructed tidal hats were one to two orders of magnitude lower than
   that in the natural ones. Biomass of macrobenthos and microbial
   respiration rate, however, were not significantly different between the
   natural and the constructed tidal flats. There was an exceptional
   constructed tidal flat with similar physico-chemical and biological
   characteristics as the natural ones. It is most probable that sufficient
   conditions to have similar tidal flats to natural ones are not only the
   slope, but also the location in enclosed bay or calm coastal area. Thus,
   to make man-made tidal flats with the same characteristics as those in
   natural one, man-made tidal flats should be designed and/or located to
   enhance the accumulation of silt on tidal flat. It is important to
   select a place having low water motion and to construct a hat with small
   slope. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd; All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solid materials as iron powder, graphite and activated carbon were
   tested for their catalytic properties for the oxidation of
   4-chlorophenol in aqueous solution with hydrogen peroxide. Batch tests
   were performed at 30 degrees C, and continuous tests with granular
   activated carbon under ambient conditions (20 degrees C). Iron powder
   was shown to act as a catalyst for the activation of hydrogen peroxide
   and owing to this for the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol. The catalytic
   activity is based on iron ions leached from the iron powder which act as
   homogeneous catalysts. Thus, the process can be described as a Fenton
   reaction enabled by a dissolution of iron powder. The same phenomenon
   was observed when iron impregnated activated carbon was applied as a
   catalyst. In contrast to iron powder, graphite and activated carbon were
   found to act as heterogeneous catalysts for the activation of hydrogen
   peroxide and the oxidation of 4-chlorophenol: During the oxidation of
   4-chlorophenol with activated carbon as a catalyst the decomposition of
   H2O2 is significantly slower than in the absence of 4-chlorophenol. This
   can be explained by the adsorption of 4-chlorophenol, due to which the
   surface area of the activated carbon available for the decomposition of
   H2O2, is reduced. At the same concentration of catalytic material in
   batch tests, the oxidation 4-chlorophenol proceeds much faster when iron
   powder instead of graphite or activated carbon is used. On the other
   hand, graphite and activated carbon are stable catalysts not affected by
   dissolution processes. Activated carbon can be utilized for a continuous
   process in a fixed bed reactor. For this purpose the efficiency of
   4-chlorophenol oxidation in granular activated carbon filled columns was
   investigated and a 25\% conversion of the 4-chlorophenol (1 g l(-1)) was
   achieved at a retention time of 26 min. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{N-chloropiperidine in chlorinated municipal wastewaters is worthy of
   attention both because of its genotoxicity and because of the acute
   general toxicity displayed by all chloramines. Here, the rate at which
   it is reduced and thus detoxified by sulfite is determined in alkaline
   solutions. Three parallel reaction paths, with rate constants at 25
   degrees C are: SO32- + ClNC5H10 + H3BO3 (buffer) --> products, k(1) =
   565 M-2 s(-1); SO32- + ClNC5H10 + H3O+ --> products, k(2) = 1.13 x
   10(11) M-2 S-1 and SO32- + ClNC5H10 + H2O --> products, k(3) = 4.1 M-1
   S-1. The activation energy associated with the last (uncatalyzed)
   pathway is 30 +/- 2 kJ mol(-1). Exploratory experiments suggest that
   N-chlorodiethylamine reacts at a rate similar to N-chloropiperidine
   whereas N-chloropyrrolidine reacts about 5 times faster. These are the
   first systematic measurements of the rate of dechlorination of secondary
   N-chloramines. At the slightly acidic pH of ordinary municipal
   wastewaters, such compounds will be reduced quickly by standard
   dechlorination practices and they cannot contribute significantly to the
   slowly reduced residual chlorine that has been discovered in
   dechlorinated effluents from wastewater treatment plants. On the other
   hand, above pH 8 their lifetime in dechlorinated effluents could become
   long enough to affect aquatic wildlife. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Various methods for direct and indirect biofilm amount estimation are
   available but most of them have been developed on free cell cultures
   and/or their application to biofilm analysis often implies biofilm
   removal from the solid surface or extraction procedures. This work
   presents a method to measure biofilm bacterial activity, that does not
   require the removal step. It uses fluorescein diacetate (FDA), a
   fluorogen (fluorescein) conjugated to two acetate radicals. This
   compound, once hydrolyzed by an exoenzyme that is present in almost all
   bacteria, releases the fluorogen that has an absorbance at 490 nm.
   Experimental tests have shown a good correlation between the absorbance
   of the solution at 490 nm and bacterial concentrations. This method may
   be particularly helpful in potable water pipe control to indicate where
   and when it is necessary to perform corrective actions to stop and/or
   reduce biofilm growth. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Three types of biogranules treating wastewater containing various
   sulphate concentrations were examined using scanning and transmission
   electron microscopies. The two biogranules treating wastewater
   containing sulphate up to 2000 mg.l(-1) showed high degrees of
   activities. However, activities of the third biogranules, which
   contained 102 mg-S.(g-VSS)(-1) after treating wastewater containing
   sulphate up to 7500 mg.l(-1) for over 286 days, dropped drastically.
   Microscopic examinations showed that precipitates accumulated in the
   biogranules treating sulphate-bearing wastewater; the degrees of
   precipitation increased with sulphate concentration in wastewater and
   the duration of treatment. Excessive precipitation was found throughout
   the entire biogranule cross-section of the third biogranules. Analyses
   by X-ray spectrometry further showed that the precipitates were mainly
   composed of sulphur, plus copper, iron and nicker presumably in the form
   of metal sulphides. These observations suggest that the inhibition of
   bioactivities of anaerobic granules was likely resulted from the
   accumulated sulphureous precipitates on the bacterial surface. This
   point was overlooked by previous investigators who tended to attribute
   the inhibition to the toxic effects of either sulphate, sulphide or
   un:dissociated H2S. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Lagoon systems generally represent an effective wastewater treatment
   process for small communities in rural regions. However, sensitive
   receiving waters promote an increasing need for algal removal and

   two types of small constructed wetlands which have been investigated
   over a period of several years: The stress is upon the seasonal
   differences and the effect of dry or wet weather operation. Design,
   construction and maintenance of the wetlands are described. The reed
   beds produced high effluent qualities in terms of suspended solids,
   algae, COD and hygienic aspects. During summer about 50\% of influent
   concentration of chlorophyll and about 60\% of suspended matter could be
   filtered by a subsurface flown constructed wetland. Furthermore, a
   buffering of pH value and temperature could be observed after the
   passage of the wetlands. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Freezing tests were conducted with alum sludge that had been dewatered
   to a solids content typically produced by a gravity thickener, vacuum
   filter, and belt press. These sludges were then frozen at various rates
   in thin layers to simulate a horizontal belt freezer. The tests indicate
   that a low freezing rate and a high initial solids content produce
   larger alum sludge particles. Curing time has no effect on grain size.
   The maximum freezing rates for the gravity-thickened, vacuum-filtered,
   and belt-pressed sludges were 6.6, 15.5, and 19.8 kg h(-1) m(-2),
   respectively. The electrical cost of freezing sludge with this device
   was estimated to be \$0.004 m(-3). These tests show that dewatering
   prior to freezing not only saves energy because it reduces the amount of
   sludge to be frozen, but it improves the final product in terms of a
   larger effective grain size. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The flow drag in heterogeneous systems is calculated by summing the
   forces exerted by the fluid on the particles in the system. If the solid
   particles are of the same size and uniformly dispersed, the forces are
   equal to one another. If the grain population is polydisperse, the
   problem seems to be difficult and still unsolved. A method is proposed
   to calculate the effective hydrodynamic grain size, which except for the
   size distribution, takes into account the packing fraction of solids.
   The method deals with the artificial transformation of a given system
   into a dense system of permeable aggregates of the same fluid
   permeability, the calculation of the effective aggregate radius in the
   population, and the conversion back to the arrangement of impermeable
   particles, which becomes converted in this way into the relevant
   monodisperse system. The effective size is calculated from the moment of
   the order D-3 of the size distribution by volume, where D is the fractal
   dimension of aggregates, dependent in a known way on the packing
   fraction of impermeable particles. A very good agreement with experiment
   is presented. The obtained result is thus a useful tool to predict the
   kinetics of flow in polydisperse systems, both those composed of fractal
   permeable aggregates and non-aggregated, usually formed in the sludge
   filtration, expression and sedimentation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The aggregation kinetics of fully destabilized colloidal hematite
   particles under conditions of varying laminar shear stress were
   investigated. Particle size distributions were measured over time, which
   allowed for a mechanistic evaluation of various aggregate-aggregate
   interaction rates. It was observed experimentally that large aggregates
   react rapidly with sub-micron size fractions under conditions of an
   applied shear stress; Brownian motion appears to dominate interactions
   only at early times when a monomodal size distribution exists. It was
   hypothesized that collisions between dissimilar sized aggregates are
   favored under laminar shear conditions. The experimental results also
   suggest that hydrodynamic influences are less important when porous,
   fractal aggregates are interacting than in interactions between
   impermeable spheres. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The photolytic behaviors of gas-phase I,1-dichloroethylene (DCE),
   trichloroethylene (TCE), and perchloroethylene (PCE) in air streams by
   ultraviolet irradiation and UV/O-3 process were studied. The addition of
   ozone slightly improved the removal of TCE by UV/O-3 process, and
   excessive ozone would reduce the treatment efficiency of TCE. The
   enhancement of UV light intensity would promote the decomposition of TCE
   more effectively than the supplement of ozone. The mineralization and
   dechlorination of chloroethylenes by UV photolysis can be apparently
   promoted in presence with ozone and were affected by the number of
   chlorine atom substituted on the CC bond. The photolytic behaviors bf
   TCE and the individual contribution to the decomposition of TCE by UV
   direct photolysis and by OH destruction in the UV/O-3/TCE system were
   well modeled by the proposed decomposition scheme. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The present work investigates the treatment of waste drawing oil which
   is a high-strength waste oil/water emulsion commonly used in the cable
   and wire industries. Semi-batch ultrafiltration (UF) and ion exchange
   processes were employed to treat the waste oil/water emulsion.
   Experiments were conducted to examine the performance characteristics of
   the UF membranes of hydrophilic and hydrophobic types and of different
   pore sizes. Ion exchange treatment using synthetic strong acid cationic
   and strong base anionic resins was used as the polishing step to further
   lower the permeate COD and copper concentration and to improve the
   turbidity and conductivity. The test results have shown very good
   performances of combined UF and ion exchange processes. The water
   quality of permeate from the combined treatment processes has been
   consistently excellent which permits direct discharge or can be
   considered for re-use. An economic evaluation and a simple flow chart of
   the treatment system are also presented to show its advantage over the
   current practice of waste drawing oil disposal. (C) 1998 Published by

Abstract = {{Raw water and drinking water samples collected from five treatment
   plants supplied by a northern Italian lake in two periods of the year
   (summer and winter) were studied for their mutagenicity. The water
   samples were concentrated on silica C-18 cartridges and the adsorbates
   were tested at increasing doses with a bacterial short-term mutagenicity
   test (Ames test with Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains),
   which reveals the gene-mutation-inducing ability of pollutants, and with
   a plant genotoxicity bioassay (Tradescantia/micronucleus test), which
   determines clastogenicity (chromosome-breaking ability). Raw water
   samples from all treatment plants were found to contain bacterial
   direct-acting mutagens detectable mainly with TA98 strain. The analyses
   of drinking water samples after water treatment showed some interesting
   results: TA98 mutagenicity was reduced when ozone was used together with
   chlorine dioxide, but TA100 mutagenicity was increased, though only in
   the summer sample; mutagenicity detectable with both strains was always
   reduced after chlorine dioxide disinfection; on the contrary, in all
   treatment plants using NaClO TA98 mutagenicity of winter samples
   increased. Raw lake water induced a high number of micronuclei in the
   Tradescantia/micronucleus lest, showing a strong clastogenicity. This
   activity was higher in the NaClO-treated samples, and lower with the
   other disinfectants. Therefore, disinfection of lake water with ozone
   and/or chlorine dioxide seems to be a suitable alternative to the use of
   NaClO for controlling the formation of nonvolatile mutagens. The
   concentration method coupled with the two mutagenicity tests was found
   to be a simple, rapid and relatively inexpensive system for monitoring
   treatment plants and studying the influence of different disinfection
   systems on water mutagenicity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The transition of shallow lake ecosystems between the clear-water,
   macrophyte-dominated state and the turbid state dominated by
   phytoplankton depends on both physico-chemical and biological factors.
   In this study, the impact of some of these interactions on the stability
   of the macrophyte-dominated state of a lake are studied by means of the
   integrated eutrophication model PCLake. The model describes
   phytoplankton, macrophytes and a simplified food web, within the
   framework of closed nutrient cycles. The aim of the study is to evaluate
   the impact of herbivory by birds and fish on the transition from clear
   to turbid state, including the influence of variability in other
   biological parameters. The model was applied to the data of a small,
   biomanipulated lake, dominated by macrophytes, showing signs of a
   transition back to the turbid state. Simulations were carried out for
   the lake as well as for an experimental situation where herbivory was
   impeded. A parameter variation study was performed for 10 parameters,
   affecting the zooplankton, fish and macrophytes behaviour, to determine
   the sensitivities and the model uncertainty. The model reproduced
   adequately the transition of the lake from phytoplankton dominance
   before the biomanipulation, via dominance of rooted perennial plants in
   the first years after it, to a state characterized by turion-forming
   plants in early summer and phytoplankton in autumn. It is shown that the
   probability of the transition back to phytoplankton dominance is mainly
   enhanced by herbivory by birds. This caused a shift towards inedible
   plant species with a shorter natural growing season, allowing the return
   of a phytoplankton bloom in autumn. If herbivory was impeded, this shift
   did not occur and phytoplankton remained low due to nitrogen limitation.
   The model results were quite sensitive to the zooplankton filtering rate
   and, in the presence of herbivory only, to the macrophytes growth
   parameters. The impact of the fish parameters showed to be less
   important. The model may be used to evaluate the relative importance of
   different assumptions or factors in the success of biomanipulation
   measures in lakes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of a laboratory-scale two-phase anaerobic digestion system
   treating dairy wastewater was investigated using the pre-determined
   operating criteria for the anaerobic acidification reactor. The results,
   obtained from a 9 month operation, showed that overall, 90\% COD and
   95\% BOD removal efficiencies at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 5 kg
   COD/m(3) d and a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2 days were achieved.
   The acidogenic phase completely stirred tank reactor was operated up to
   an OLR of 23 kg COD/m(3) d with a HRT of 0.5 days whereas the
   methanogenic-phase upflow anaerobic filter was loaded up to an OLR of 7
   kg COD/m(3) d with a HRT of approximately 1.5 days. In the
   pre-acidification reactor, a maximum of 60\% conversion rate of COD to
   volatile fatty acids (VFAs) was achieved at an OLR of 12 kg COD/m(3) d
   after which the conversion rate remained reasonably constant while a
   60\% removal of total fatty matter was obtained. Good separation of acid
   and methane phases was achieved as indicated by low and high methane
   yields in the first and second phases respectively. VFAs produced during
   the acidogenic phase were effectively consumed in the methanogenic
   phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of the compounds present in a previously chlorinated
   wastewater resulting from the production of azoic dyes has been studied
   in this project. Towards this end, the first step developed was the
   characterization of the spillage water by GC/MS and GC/FID. Secondly, a
   combined ozone + Ca(OH)(2) treatment was carried out, determining its
   efficiency on this wastewater. The majority of compounds found in the
   wastewater are aniline derivatives and azo compounds. Also, as a result
   of the chlorination treatment which is carried out by the factory, some
   organochloride compounds were identified, being the most important those
   which are subjected to legislative control, namely: chloroanilines,
   chloronitrobenzenes and chlorophenols. After ozonation, the
   concentration of the compounds present is reduced to good percentages.
   The by-products formed after this first treatment were, mainly,
   nitrobenzene derivatives and organic acid compounds. The following
   treatment with Ca(OH)2 leads to almost total elimination of the
   remaining compounds in the ozone treatment. However, aniline and
   chloroanilines are formed after chemical coagulation due to the strong
   basic medium at which the sample in this process is set. C.O.D. is
   reduced 25\% after ozonation, while it decreased 50\% after the complete
   treatment. T.O.C. remained constant during ozonation, but a 42\%
   reduction was obtained after chemical coagulation. Color decreased
   gradually during ozonation reaction, and after the final treatment the
   reduction was 62\%. The complete process of ozonation and chemical
   coagulation with Ca(OH)2 is, in general, very effective to treat this
   kind of wastewaters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial denitrification and the occurrence of neutralization in a
   denitrifying biofilm-electrode reactor (BER) using an amorphous carbon
   anode has been experimentally demonstrated. In this study, the BER was
   operated over one year and measurements of influent and effluent ionic
   species were made at different electric currents to evaluate the
   predominant electrochemical and biological reactions. The ionic species
   measured were NO3-, NO2-, SO42--, Cl-, PO43-, NH4+, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and
   Mg2+, most of which are common constituents of surface water or
   groundwater, Concentrations of Na+, K+, SO42- and Cl- were almost the
   same in the influent and effluent. Removal efficiency of nitrate (NOS)
   varied in the range of about 0 to 100\%, depending on the electric
   current. Complete denitrification to Nz gas was readily achieved without
   accumulation of NO2-, N2O and NH4+. The concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+
   decreased due to deposition onto the surface of the electrode, but the
   calculation result from the solubility equilibrium of CaCO3, MgCO3 and
   CaMg(CO3)(2) using the saturation index (SI) showed that the deposition
   could be hampered by the electrochemical neutralization in the reactor.
   Furthermore, the deposited calcium and magnesium could be redissolved
   immediately by changing the polarity of electrodes. From these results,
   it is concluded that a highly selective reduction of nitrate is
   operationally possible in the present BER, hence this process is a
   feasible alternative for the treatment of various nitrate-contaminated
   water. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Acidic phosphate granules encapsulated within a pH-sensitive wall were
   used to demonstrate pH control during denitrification. Characterization
   of the distribution of microcapsule mass and percent potassium content
   of the core showed that the wall was an average of 30.3\% of the total
   microcapsule mass. A stochastic model using Monte Carlo methods was
   developed describing the kinetics of release of the microcapsule core in
   solution. The model satisfactorily predicted the pH drop and potassium
   release as a function of time for experiments performed at various pH
   values in the absence of biological activity. Although the model only
   fairly predicted the actual values of pH and potassium released during
   the denitrification experiments, the model predicted the pH trends quite
   well as shown by the similar predictions in the increase and decrease in
   pH. The experimental data demonstrate that pH control using the
   microcapsules was effective because the pH rise caused by
   denitrification was counteracted by the release of the acidic
   microcapsule core. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of copper cation (II) in aqueous solutions by living mycelium
   pellets of Phanerochete chrysosporium was investigated to study the
   effects of metal concentration, pH, organic solvents and common cation.
   The maximum copper adsorption capacity of the fungal mycelium estimated
   with the Langmuir model was 3.9 mmol Cu per gram of dry mycelium
   compared with 1.04 mmol Cu per gram of a strong acidic ion-exchange
   resin. The living mycelium also showed a high affinity to copper in
   diluted solutions. The adsorption distribution coefficient (K)
   maintained a constant value around 1.61 per gram of adsorbent in the
   solutions of up to 100 mg Cu/l. Ion-exchange of copper cations with
   fungal biomass accounted for a small part (< 1\%) of copper uptake by
   the fungal mycelium. The high capacity of copper uptake by living
   mycelium was mainly attributed to adsorption of very tiny colloids of
   copper hydroxide formed around pH 6, which was observed with scanning
   electron microscope and indicated by the pH effect on metal adsorption.
   Compared with an ion-exchange resin which showed a quite consistent
   adsorption capacity in a pH range of 2.5-5, the living fungal mycelium
   had an optimal adsorption capacity in a quite narrow pH range around 6.
   Copper adsorption and desorption on the fungal mycelium was easily
   repeated by controlling pH, a unique property of the fungal mycelium for
   continuous removal and recovery of copper cation from water. Organic
   solvents had little or positive effect on the copper adsorption capacity
   of living fungal hyphae. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this paper, a series of wet oxidation experiments was carried out in
   a 2-1 autoclave reactor. To achieve a significant reduction of the
   reaction temperature and pressure, two new oxidation methods were
   applied. One was to partially or totally replace oxygen with a stronger
   oxidant, viz. hydrogen peroxide, and the other was to introduce a
   catalyst. Both processes were found to achieve a higher initial reaction
   rate of TOC and colour reduction at lower reaction temperatures and
   pressures as compared with the conventional wet air oxidation. By
   combining the two new improved methods to treat the dyeing wastewater
   concentrate from a membrane separation process, almost 80\% of TOC
   reduction and 90\% of colour removal were achieved within half-an-hour
   at a reaction temperature of 110 degrees C and a system total pressure
   of 50 kPa. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The biosorbent prepared from Sargassum algal biomass binds approximately
   2.3 meq/g of metal cations from water by ion exchange. The values of ion
   exchange equilibrium constants showed that the affinities of metals
   towards the biosorbent decrease in the following order Cu>Ca>Fe. A
   flow-through sorption column was used to continuously and selectively
   remove Cu2+ from the feed containing Cu and Fe ions. A chromatographic
   effect in the column performance caused by different sorption affinities
   of the metal ions studied was successfully predicted by the equilibrium
   column model. The biosorbent saturated with Cu was regenerated with 0.1
   M HCl. When Fe(III) was present in the mixed feed solution as suspended
   solids (SS) the column removed Cu2+ by biosorption and Fe(III) solids by
   in-detpth filtration while producing effluent free ai heavy metals from
   the feed containing 25 mg/l of Cu2+ and Fe(III) as SS in the
   concentration range of 15-40 mg/l. Effective copper removal/recovery
   from ferruginous wastewater using Sargassum biosorbent was demonstrated.

Abstract = {{Using experimental microecosystems the kinetics of phenol disappearance
   in small forest pond waters (Siberia, Russia) in the summer of 1995-96
   were investigated. Despite of high variability of components of the
   ecosystem (plankton biomass and species composition) and two pronounced
   ``blooms{''} of green algae Volvox aureus the same kinetics of the
   disappearance took place over the investigated period. Half-lives of the
   pollutant depended on water temperature only. A comparison of the
   self-purification of the pond with that of the Krasnoyarsk reservoir,
   ``blooming{''} with blue-greens was carried out. Half-lives in the pond
   were significantly lower than that in the reservoir. During the periods
   of ``blooms{''} of the green algae in the pond the concentrations of
   inorganic nutrients were comparatively high and the phenol-degrading
   bacteria likely were not limited by these nutrients, in contrast to the
   periods of ``bloom{''} of the blue-green algae in the reservoir. (C)

Abstract = {{This research investigates the solute and suspended solids loading from
   various catchment areas and their streams into Lake Victoria. Physical
   parameters were measured and water samples were taken approximately
   monthly for 1 year at several stations along the streams. Samples were
   analyzed for nutrients, major ions and suspended solids. The total
   nitrogen and phosphorus loadings determined from the studied catchments
   were extrapolated to calculate the loadings into the entire lake from
   its watershed. A range is given to represent extremes of conditions of
   land use and stream profile: minimum values are loadings from arable
   non-agricultural lands, slow moving streams and hat plains whereas
   maximum values are obtained from pasture land (manure input), high
   discharge and steep topography (increased erosion). These values are
   minimum loads since the first flush of rain events were not captured. An
   attempt was made to assess from the literature the total point and
   diffuse loadings into Lake Victoria. There are still many gaps in the
   data (especially industrial inputs) and further research is needed to
   obtain more certainty in the assessment of pollution and future
   environmental management strategies of the lake. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In Germany, bank-filtered raw water and ground water is mainly used for
   drinking water conditioning. Microorganisms, which are neither retarded
   by the subsoil passage of the bank-filtration, nor by the different
   filtration and disinfection steps at the water works, cause the growth
   of biofilms on different materials originally used in drinking water
   distribution systems. The development, the phylogenetical diversity and
   the bacterial metabolic activities of biofilms on polyethylen (PE-HD),
   polyvinyl chlorid (PVC), steel and copper were analyzed at different
   sampling points. The incubation experiments were performed under natural
   conditions using a flow device technique. The devices were installed
   after the activated carbon filters and disinfection step at the water
   works and at two different house branch connections within the
   distribution system of the conditioned drinking water of the water
   works. The synthetic materials were colonized very rapidly within a few
   days in significant higher densities than steel and copper. The total
   bacterial cell counts of the biofilms were measured by DAPI
   (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. The metabolic activities of
   the bacteria were quantified by the use of the redox dye CTC
   (5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride); which is frequently
   described as an indicator for respiration. The highest respiratory
   activities were observed in biofilms from synthetic materials grown
   after the activated carbon filters at the water works. A significant
   reduction of the total bacterial cell counts and respiratory activities
   of about 80\% was measured due to the disinfection at the water works. A
   time dependent growth of bacteria in biofilms was observed at the two
   sampling points within the distribution system, whereas the percentage
   of CTC-reducing cells stabilized at 35\%. The in situ-hy bridizations
   with fluorescence labelled, group-specific rRNA targeted oligonucleotide
   probes revealed the following: (i) bacteria of the Beta- and
   Gamma-subclass of Proteobacteria were found most frequently within the
   biofilm population, (ii) the percentage of the different subclasses
   depended on the used material, (iii) there were no significant changes
   in bacterial subclass composition of the biofilms taken from the water
   works and house branch connections. In addition, polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR), southern blot hybridization and in situ hybridization
   were used to detect facultative pathogenic bacteria in biofilms.
   Non-pneumophila Legionella were found in a relative high percentage up
   to about 7\% in many biofilms, whereas fecal streptococci were detected
   only in few biofilms of the drinking water distribution systems (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A simple and novel method has been developed for the analysis of
   haloacetic acids (HAAs), disinfection by-products (DBPs) formed during
   water chlorination. This method can be used to determine six of these
   acids, including chloro, bromo and chloro/bromo acids. The validity and
   reliability of the method were tested over 6 months on twenty French
   water samples. 50 ml of water are percolated over an ion-exchange resin,
   the strong acids are trapped and then eluted and simultaneously
   esterified to give their methyl derivatives by a methyl alcohol solution
   acidified with sulfuric acid. The esters are extracted by cyclohexane
   and analyzed by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection
   (GC/ECD). Dalapon is used as a tracer in order to monitor the extraction
   process and trichloropropane as the internal standard. The detection
   limits for the HAAs analyzed are between 0.1 mu g/l and 0.2/mu g/l. The
   analysis of different water samples showed that all the haloacetic
   acids, except monobromoacetic acid? were present. The total HAAs in
   water originating from surface waters was less than 50 mu g/l, but could
   exceed 100 mu g/l for water originating from reservoir waters. In
   underground waters, the concentration of HAAs was negligible. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The influence of an extended set of metals (Ca2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+
   Ni2+, Zn2+ Mn2+, Fe3+) on the reduction rates of chromium (VI) with H2S
   have been measured in NaCl solutions. Ca2+ and Zn2+ (0.01 to 0.02 M and
   0.5 to 3.0 mu M) did not show any significant effect. Mg2+ and Mn2+
   (0.05 to 0.2 M and 1.8 to 14.2 mu M) produced only moderate increases in
   the rates in 0.5 M NaCl that were not proportional to the metal
   concentrations. The metals studied (Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+ Ni2+) caused large
   increases in the reduction rates at micromolar concentrations. The
   effect was attributed to the formation of MeCrO4 complexes which react
   faster with sulfide than free chromate. From measurements of the rates
   as a function of the added metal the rate constants for the metal
   chromate complexes were determined. The rates increased in the order
   k(NiCrO4)>k(PbCrO4)>(CuCrO4)>k(CdCrO4). The addition of Fe(III) (0.2 to
   1.8 mu M) increased the rates considerably due to the catalytic cycling
   of the redox reactions of iron. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The sorption and leaching processes of diuron from a 0.02 M CaCl2
   aqueous solution at 25 degrees C, by a calcareous soil from the
   Southeastern of Spain after organic carbon (OC) amendment with a
   commercial peat (from 0.18\% to 4.61\%) have been studied by using batch
   and soil column experiments. The experimental sorption isotherms may be
   classified as L type of the Giles classification which suggests, in
   general, a moderate affinity of the diuron molecules by the active sites
   of the adsorbents. Nevertheless, according to the slope of the initial
   portion of these isotherms, the affinity increases as the organic matter
   content increases. In order to calculate the adsorption capacity (K-r)
   of the samples for the herbicide diuron, the experimental data point
   were fitted to the Freundlich equation. The K-f values ranged between
   2.17 mg kg(-1) for the original soil (containing 0.18\% OC) and 34.28 mg
   kg(-1) for the peat-amended sample containing 4.61\% OC. The
   breakthrough curves and distribution of diuron along the soil profile,
   obtained from the step-function type and pulse type experiments by using
   the soil column studies, indicate that the amount of diuron retained
   range from 359.3 mg kg(-1) for the column filled with the original soil
   to 439 mg kg(-1) for that filled with the peat-amended soil containing
   4.61\% OC. The amount of diuron desorbed (373.0 mg kg(-1)) from the soil
   containing the higher percentage of organic carbon (4.61\%) was greater
   than that desorbed (300.8 mg kg(-1)) from the original soil, which might
   be due to the joining of diuron to the soluble fraction of the organic
   matter moving through the column. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{For many years the water supply system of Athens in Greece has been
   disinfected mainly by chlorination. A consequence of chlorination is the
   formation of trihalomethanes (THMs). A survey was conducted to determine
   their levels in the Athens water supply system over a period of time. A
   multiple regression model for THM formation was generated for predicting
   THMs in the finished water leaving the plant using the field sampling of
   the Galatsi Treatment Plant (GTP) of Athens with respect to-temperature,
   pH, chlorine dose, bromide and chlorophyll a. In general; this model was
   found to give acceptable fits. Overall 82\% of the predicted values were
   within +/-20\% of the measured values. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{For the first time it is shown that EDTA is ultimately biodegraded under
   practical industrial wastewater treatment conditions, involving a
   Finnish plant dedicated to treat the effluent from a paper mill.
   Monitoring measurements on the influent and the treated effluent showed
   an EDTA elimination of about 80\%. The mean EDTA concentration in the
   influent was 23.8 mg l(-1) and in the corresponding effluent 5.8 mg
   l(-1). The biodegradability of EDTA was verified in the laboratory with
   activated sludge from the treatment plant. Using a combined CO2/DOC
   method the total mineralization of EDTA was indicated by > 80\% CO2
   formation and greater than or equal to 99\% DOC removal. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The mobility of radiocesium was studied in a number of soil and sediment
   cores collected from the Devoke Water catchment. Samples were subjected
   to a range of techniques, which are currently used in countries from
   western Europe and the former Soviet Union and which were developed on
   the premise that radionuclides are present in different forms which
   influence their mobility in the environment. The techniques were found
   to provide complimentary information and are very useful in the
   prediction of the mobility of post-Chernobyl radionuclides in the
   aquatic environment. Radiocesium was found to be much more mobile in the
   organic soils of the Devoke Water catchment than in the mineral soils. A
   simple model, based on the similarities in the ion-exchange behavior of
   radiocesium and potassium, was successfully used to predict the
   concentration of radiocesium in runoff water and in the lake. The
   results suggest radiocesium in the peat soils to be mainly bound to
   organic exchange sites. In-situ K-D values for radiocesium in Devoke
   Water sediments, which varied over one order of magnitude with depth in
   the sediment, were accurately predicted using an ion-exchange model
   based on the premise that radiocesium was sorbed exclusively on the
   frayed edges of clay minerals. It is shown that ``exchangeable{''}-K-D's
   more accurately reflect the fraction of particulate radiocesium that is
   available for exchange with the solution and most closely correspond to
   the assumptions of the ion-exchange theory. Therefore, this parameter is
   recommended for use in radionuclide transport models. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Two representative rivers, Shing Mun River and Lam Tsuen River, of Hong
   Kong were each monitored for 13 consecutive months for the levels of E,
   coli, Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts, with a view to
   providing sufficient data for substantiating the need for developing
   relevant water quality guidelines. Both rivers were found to be faecally
   polluted in terms of E. coli level, Cryptosporidium oocysts were seldom
   detected at both rivers. Giardia cysts levels were often found below 10
   per I at sparsely populated remote sampling points at Lam Tsuen River.
   Whereas sampling points situated at the lower reaches of the river
   receiving treated effluent discharges from a highly populated
   residential development and from a number of village houses served by
   sewage treatment plants and septic tanks, respectively, Giardia cysts
   were frequently found at much higher levels (as high as 468 cysts per
   1). Concentrations of Giardia cysts at the three sampling points of
   Shing Mun River varied from undetectable to over 100 per 1. The levels
   of Giardia cysts also seemed to be related to the type of treatment
   facilities employed by the houses/developments located along the river
   banks. However, the levels of Giardia cysts detected at the two rivers
   were not correlated to the levels of E. coli present. Our findings
   suggested that Giardia may be used as an indicator of treatment efficacy
   for parasite removal from sewage and there is scope for inclusion of a
   parasitological indicator in water quality guidelines for local river
   waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study developed the in situ synthesis of CNCI as a Safe and

   study demonstrated that the synthesized CNCI standards are comparable
   with commercial standards based on results from purge-and-trap GC/MS
   analysis and micro-liquid/liquid extraction with GC/ECD analysis.
   Furthermore, the synthesized CNCI solution provides a source of
   externally prepared standards, which avoids gas-liquid transfer
   procedures. Only microgram quantities of this hazardous substance were
   generated and may be safely converted to the relatively innocuous
   cyanate ion immediately after use by simply raising the pH. This
   performance-based approach led to a successful means to synthesize
   aqueous CNCI solutions as either quality control standards or
   calibration standards. It may be especially useful for laboratories in
   other countries where CNCI is difficult to acquire. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A method was optimized and validated for the simultaneous determination
   of chloride, sulfate and nitrate anions by capillary electrophoresis
   with indirect UV detection using hydrodynamic sample injection. A good
   linearity was observed for chloride in a concentration range of 5.0-200
   mu M, and for sulfate and nitrate in a concentration range of 1.0-200 mu
   M. The relative standard deviations in the peak areas were 7.20\%,
   3.25\% and 4.86\% for chloride, sulfate and nitrate, respectively. This
   method was applied for the determination of sulfate, nitrate and
   chloride in the rainwater samples collected in Miami. Florida, between
   1995 and 1996. An analysis of the rainwater data suggests that chloride
   found in rainwater most likely originates from marine aerosol, whereas
   sulfate comes mainly from anthropogenic activities. High levels of
   nitrate (>30 mM) in rainwater are largely associated with anthropogenic
   activities and summer thunderstorms in South Florida. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Chemical reduction of nitrate by metallic iron (Fe-0) was studied as a
   potential technology to remove nitrate from water. The effects of pH and
   the iron-to-nitrate ratio on both nitrate reduction rate and percent
   removal were investigated. Rate constants and the apparent reaction
   order with respect to nitrate were determined and a mass balance was
   obtained. Rapid nitrate reduction by iron powder was observed only at pH
   less than or equal to 4. pH control with sulfuric acid significantly
   prolonged nitrate reduction and increased the percent removal. At high
   nitrate loadings, both the rate and the percent removal increased with
   decreasing pH. An iron-to-nitrate ratio of 120 m(2) Fe-0/mol NO3 or
   higher was required to completely remove nitrate within an hour. An
   apparent reaction order of 1.7 with respect to nitrate was observed,
   which may be partly due to the inhibitory effect of sulfate. Ammonia was
   the end product of nitrate reduction and accounted for all nitrate
   transformed under our experimental conditions. Acidity is the principal
   factor which controls the rate and the extent of nitrate removal by
   Fe-0. The rapid reduction of nitrate at low pH was most likely due to
   either direct reduction by Fe-0 or indirect reduction by surface
   hydrogen derived from proton. Ferrous species, Fe2+ and Fe(OH)(2), were
   probably not involved in this reaction. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Hysteresis of dissolved calcium, silicon, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium and
   phosphorus fractions, i.e. soluble reactive phosphorus, total dissolved
   phosphorus and total phosphorus, in river waters during a major storm
   event in the R. Swale catchment in Yorkshire (U.K.), are quantified
   using a semi-empirical model. The model separates point and base-flow
   contributions of the chemical determinants from diffuse inputs. The
   magnitude of the diffuse inputs is related to river water discharge so
   that the size and rotation of the hysteresis loop is characterized by a
   single parameter. The approach is applied to chemical and water
   discharge data collected at 2 h intervals from three river sites in the
   catchment over a complete storm hydrograph. The results illustrate
   hysteresis effects for all the determinants with the majority showing
   ``clockwise{''} hysteresis, i.e. higher concentrations during the rising
   limb of the hydrograph compared with those measured during the falling
   limb. The model parameters, computed by optimizing agreement between the
   predicted and measured concentration-discharge relationships, are
   generally consistent with land-use patterns in the catchment. The method
   has potential for further development to enable comparisons of chemical
   and nutrient dynamics in river catchments and the assessment of the
   relative importance of diffuse and point sources during high flow
   conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2291-2298}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory system was developed for modelling the colonization of
   slate-discs by riverine epilithic biofilm capable of the biodegradation
   of anionic surfactants. Initial experiments using batch or batch-fed
   systems produced biofilms yielding at least 10-times fewer viable
   bacteria and slower surfactant biodegradation rates than occur in
   indigenous biofilms formed on slate-discs placed in the River Taff,
   South Wales. Increased aeration, and the continuous-feeding of the
   microcosm with nutrient-amended discharge from a sewage-treatment plant,
   separately gave rise to increased epilithic bacterial numbers and SDS
   biodegradation rates. The epilithon from a slate colonized in a
   microcosm, which initially had been inoculated with river water and
   continuously-fed at a dilution rate of 1 d(-1) was compared, for a
   variety of characteristics, with the epilithon from a slate colonized in
   a polluted reach of the river Taff. On the basis of similarities in
   bacterial numbers and parameters specific to surfactant-biodegradation
   rates, and comparable bacterial metabolic capacities, the
   continuous-flow fed microcosm was a simple but adequate model for the
   colonization of slate-discs by epilithic bacteria in a polluted river,
   that could be used to test, in the laboratory, the effects of surfactant
   pollution in an environmentally-compatible system. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In order to determine the impact of the treated water discharge of a
   waste stabilization pond on the periphyton in the stream receptor, the
   structure and the metabolic activities of the periphytic communities
   were studied above and below the outflow. Only slight changes were
   observed in the bacterial community. The Diatom abundance and biomass
   and the relative abundance of the different species differed between
   upstream and downstream stations. The heterotrophic index was generally
   lower in the upstream control station than in the downstream stations,
   whereas periphytic chlorophyll a concentrations decreased downstream of
   the stabilization pond. This implied an increase in heterotrophic
   microorganisms and/or an adaptation by autochthonous periphytic
   microorganisms. Photosynthetic carbon fixation decreased beyond the pond
   outflow maybe because of the disappearance of sensitive species, while
   the appearance of other resistant species led to an increase iii
   productivity (autotrophic assimilation/chl a concentrations). Finally,
   potential chemoheterotrophic activity increased in the downstream
   stations, while the potential photoheterotrophic activity decreased. On
   the whole, the pond effluent preferentially favoured the development of
   chemoheterotrophic microorganisms to the detriment of photosynthetic
   microorganisms. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Chlorophenols are among priority water pollutants which are taken up by
   aquatic fauna and flora and enriched in the food chains. Acid-activated
   bituminous shale has been used as an adsorbent for the removal of
   2-chlorophenol (MCP) and 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) from water and the
   related process parameters were investigated. Kinetic analysis showed
   that the adsorption reaction could be approximated by a first-order rate
   equation for which pore-diffusion was the essential rate-controlling
   step. Adsorption was endothermic and basically of a physical character.
   Equilibrium modelling by linearized adsorption isotherms revealed that a
   Langmuir equation could well represent the observed data. The entropy
   change of adsorption was more positive for DCP due to its higher
   polarity. The saturation capacity of the sorbent for both chlorophenols
   were determined by dynamic column tests, this experimental capacity
   being lower than the theoretical monolayer capacity envisaged by the
   Langmuir equation. Adsorption was completely reversible as the retained
   DCP could be completely desorbed from the column with distilled water as
   eluant. The results were evaluated within the scope of utilization of
   cost-effective unconventional sorbents to remove chlorinated organics as
   possible substitutes for activated carbon. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Aluminium effect upon adsorption of natural fulvic acids onto PAC}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The removal of fulvic acids in natural water can be realised by several
   physico-chemical processes: activated carbon adsorption,
   coagulation-flocculation and oxidation. Activated carbon adsorption
   remains one of the most important processes used in water treatment.
   Many workers have demonstrated that the value of pH, the ionic
   composition, the temperature, the salt concentration and the type of
   carbon act upon the capacity of activated carbon to remove humic
   substances {[}Lee, M. C., Snoeyink, V. L. and Crittenden, J. C. (1981)
   Activated carbon adsorption of humic substances. JAWWA, 440-446;
   Randtke, S. J. and Jepsen, C. P. (1982) Effects of salts on actived
   carbon adsorption of fulvic acids. JAWWA 74, 84-93; Weber, W. J., Jr.,
   Voice, T. C. and Jodellah, A. (1983) Adsorption of humic substances: The
   effect of heterogeneity and system characteristics. J. Am. Wat. Wks.

   acides humiques sur charbon active en poudre. Influence du triphosphate
   de sodium. Wat. Res. 19, 1059-1064]. Whereas the association of
   activated carbon and coagulant-flocculent for the removal of organic
   matter is usually used in the case of an accidental or chronical
   pollution, only few workers have studied the mechanisms of elimination.
   The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the percent of removal
   of natural fulvic acids onto powdered activated carbon and in the
   presence of aluminium salts. Initially, one method of dosage of the
   fulvic acids has been chosen. The KMnO4 oxidizability seemed to be the
   more efficient method because the pH and the presence of aluminium don't
   affect the results. Secondly, curves of the function of the order of
   introduction of the components, function of the pH values and function
   of the presence or not of aluminium salts have been drawn. Our results
   (Fig. 9) show that the adsorption depends upon the values of the acidity
   constants (pK(a)) of the organic molecule, the order of introduction of
   the components, the PAC electrokinetic potential and the aluminium
   species (Al3+, Al(OH)(2+), Al(OH)(2)(+), Al(OH)(3), Al(OH)(4)(-),...).
   The adsorption of the lone organic molecule was more important at low pH
   (80\% of removal at pH 3) than at high pH (10\% of removal at pH 8) and
   the removal decreased strongly between pH 4 and 6; this is certainly due
   to the formation of anionic substances (fulvates). The electrostatic
   interactions for a pH greater than 5.5 between PAC and aluminium salts
   are probably responsible for a modification in the adsorption of natural
   fulvic acids. If the pH is lower than 5.5 the adsorption of the organic
   molecule is increased because of a complexation between the fulvic acids
   and the aluminium ions.
   Many workers have demonstrated that aluminium strongly complexes with
   organic molecules {[}Backes, C. A. and Tipping, E. (1987) Aluminium

Abstract = {{The study was undertaken to assess the performance of a selected range
   of holiday destinations against the microbiological determinants of the
   European Union (EU) bathing water Directive {[}Council directive of 8
   December 1975 concerning the quality of bathing waters. Official Journal
   L,31, 1-7. 76/160/EEC.]. The destinations were situated in three
   Mediterranean countries -Greece, Spain and Italy- and in the U.K.
   itself. The Mediterranean destinations were chosen on the basis of their
   popularity with British visitors, the U.K. beaches on a fairly random
   basis. All the beaches in all countries were EU designated bathing
   waters, several holding the prestigious European Blue Flag award.
   Summary findings indicate that, the five beaches sampled in Spain were
   all of very good microbiological quality for the ten days of sampling.
   Four of the beaches examined in Crete were of similar good quality. The
   fifth, at Malia, was of much poorer quality. The five Italian beaches
   all failed at least one of the Mandatory standards for either total or
   thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms. All these failures occurred on the
   same two days, coincident with heavy rainfall. The six U.K. beaches
   surveyed all passed Mandatory standards for total coliforms but one
   beach did not comply with the Mandatory standard for thermotolerant
   coliforms. The fact that several of the Mediterranean and U.K. beaches
   examined in the study were European Blue Flag beaches and that, on
   occasion, their water quality failed to meet the criteria for that
   award, suggests that such award schemes should clearly indicate that the
   guarantee of bather safety is far from absolute. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2341-2356}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The dimensionless M(V) curves indicating the distribution of pollutant
   mass vs volume in stormwater discharges are used to compare pollutant
   discharges from different rainfall events and catchments. The M(V)
   curves are very variable and dispersed for each pollutant acid for a
   series of rainfall events in a given catchment. From the analysis of 197
   rainfall events in 12 separate and combined sewer systems, the following
   results can be extracted: - in separate sewer systems, 80\% of the total
   pollutant mass is transported in the first 74\% of the total volume for
   50\% of the rainfall events; - in combined sewer systems, 80\% of the
   total pollutant mass is transported in the first 79\% of the total
   volume for 50\% of the rainfall events. The characteristics of the M(V)
   curves depend on the pollutant, the site, the rainfall event and the
   Functioning of the sewer system. No general multi-regression
   relationships can be established to explain their shape and their
   variability because of the complexity of the phenomena involved acid the
   multiplicity of influencing factors. A new definition of the first flush
   is derived from the analysis of the M(V) curves, allowing a
   non-ambiguous quantification of a phenomenon which, up to now, was
   presented in a principally descriptive or qualitative manner. It is
   assumed that there is a significant first flush if at least 80\% of the
   total pollutant mass is transported in the first 30\% of the volume
   discharged during rainfall events. Previous definitions proposed by
   other authors are discussed with regard to the treatment of stormwater
   discharges. However, the concept of the first flush can not be used
   alone to establish a reliable methodology to design treatment
   facilities. Additional knowledge and information are necessary. From
   this point of view, the analysis of experimental M(V) curves is
   appropriate to base a design methodology which takes into account the
   intrinsic variability of the phenomena. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The possibility of coupling a chemical treatment (ozonation) with a
   biological treatment (anaerobic digestion), is investigated for olive
   oil mill effluents (OME). Preliminary tests showed that both total
   phenols and unsaturated lipids are reduced to about 50\% in 3 h of
   ozonation and that the total COD remains about unvaried. Nevertheless
   ozonated OME exhibit in general a longer lag phase and a lower yield in
   methane than OME themselves. These effects are more evident at higher
   OME concentrations. Methanogenic tests were also conducted on OME
   samples to which oleic acid or p-hydroxybenzoic acid and their ozonation
   products were added. Results indicate that the ozonation products of
   oleic acid are more inhibitory than the original substrate. The
   inhibitory effects of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHBA) and its ozonation
   products show a different dependence upon concentration: inhibition of
   ozonation products is remarkable at lower concentration but it increases
   more slowly as concentration increases. No effect of ozonation is
   observed on the acidogenic step of fermentation. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One hundred and twenty coastal water samples, from twelve different
   bathing sites along the Achaia coastline (SW Greece) were analyzed for
   enteroviruses and adenoviruses using nested polymerase chain reaction,
   during a five month period (June-October), in 1995 and 1996. When nested
   PCR was used for detection of enteroviruses, 21 (17.5\%) were found
   positive. On the other hand, using cell culture, only 11 (9.2\%) were
   positive for enteroviruses with a mean number of 2.9 PFU/10 l. In
   addition, 34 (28.3\%) samples were positive by nested PCR detection for
   adenoviruses. In half of the sites, both enteroviruses and adenoviruses
   were not detected, while in the remaining half of the sites the above
   mentioned viruses were periodically detected. Moreover, thirty samples
   from non-bathing areas were also analyzed as reference samples. The
   comparison between the presence of faecal bacterial indicators and the
   presence of enteroviruses and adenoviruses did not show any significant
   correlation (P > 0.05). The PCR methodology was found highly successful
   in detecting both viruses in coastal waters of our region. The
   implementation of this molecular technique in laboratories monitoring
   environmental samples, despite the existence of some difficulties is
   expected to resolve some problems of detection of pathogen environmental
   microorganisms. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to determine the effects of various
   concentrations of solid sludge on the bioleaching of metals and the
   stabilisation of sludge using elemental sulphur as a substrate to remove
   metals by an acid bioleaching process. Two experimental series were
   carried out in batch cultures, in column-type bioreactors, using sulphur
   in the form of 25 mm diameter blocks, in a 12-litre mixture which
   contained 80\% of primary and 20\% of secondary sludge (on a dry weight
   basis). Both sludge types came from the waste water treatment centre of
   the Valcartier military base (Quebec, Canada). The suspended solids (SS)
   concentrations (g/l) of the first and second series (B and B'): ranged
   from 8 to 27 g/l, respectively, with eight concentrations per series.
   The results obtained during the bioleaching-stabilisation process show
   that the acidification rate was reduced, that the quantity of sulphate
   produced increased with the sludge solid concentration. But the
   reduction in SS and volatile suspended solids (VSS) of the leached
   sludge was greater than that obtained by stabilising the sludge
   aerobically (control). The value of the degradation constant (k(d))
   decreased in response to the increase in VSS. The solubilisation rates
   of different metals during the bioleaching stabilisation decreased as
   the sludge solid concentrations increased and were as follows: Cd
   43-79\%; Cr 22-38\%; Cu 75-97\%; Fe 40-54\%; Mn 88-98\%; Ni 25-40\%; Pb
   37-89\%; Zn 76-100\%; P 30-34\%; K 47-60\%. The use of sulphur in the
   form of blocks leads to the formation of anoxic zones in certain regions
   of the bioreactor, Favouring bacterial denitrification. Soluble
   concentrations of potassium were reduced by the end of the bioleaching
   process, whereas soluble concentrations of phosphorus and ammonium
   nitrogen increased. Despite these changes, the fertilizer values of the
   solid phase of these sludge types were effectively preserved. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The application of Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR)
   models in predicting joint toxicity of mixtures of organic chemicals to
   microorganisms is presented. In the proposed approach, QSAR models
   derived from single chemical toxicity assays are used to predict
   concentrations of components in mixtures that would jointly cause 50\%
   inhibition of microbial respiration. Experimental joint toxicity data
   from several different binary and multi-component, uniform and
   non-uniform mixture assays on two microbial cultures are used to
   validate the proposed approach. The predictions made from QSAR models
   agreed well with the experimental data with r(2)=0.80 at p=0.0001 for a
   total of 610 data points. The factor of error of the predictions ranged
   from 1.00 to 4.79, averaging 1.82. Validation tests with 16 chemicals
   not used in the QSAR model derivation yielded predictions of similar
   quality. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A dissolved oxygen model, QUAL2E, has been calibrated and validated to
   the Blackstone River, using the data collected in 1991 for the
   Blackstone River Initiative - Dry Weather Study. Physical representation
   of the river is accomplished using the data from previous studies. Flow
   profiles have been developed using the average daily flows of the three
   permanent United States Geological Survey (USGS) gaging stations and
   five wastewater treatment plants on the Blackstone River. These flow
   profiles have been verified by the success of the model to simulate a
   conservative parameter, chloride and independent flow measurements. The
   calibration and validation of the model for dissolved oxygen involved a
   stepwise approach to simulate each source and sink of dissolved oxygen.
   This has been accomplished by progressively defining atmospheric
   reaeration, oxygen depletion due to carbonaceous biochemical oxidation
   demand, nitrification, sediment oxygen demand and algal photosynthesis
   and respiration. The success of the model can also be judged by the
   ability of the model to represent the system under different conditions.
   During additional validation with data sets from 1980, the model was
   successful in predicting conditions prior to a previous waste load
   allocation for the largest point source. Statistical tests of the model
   results and the observed data have been performed for the 1991 surveys
   with a median relative error of approximately 10\%. A brief assessment
   of the 7Q10 flows indicates violations of the dissolved oxygen criteria
   of 5.0 mg/l occurring downstream of the Woonsocket wastewater treatment
   plant. Minor violations occur in Massachusetts upstream of four
   impoundments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2413-2421}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Effluents from publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) were mixed with
   Delaware River water at ratios of 1:1 or 1:2 effluent to Delaware River
   water. These mixing experiments were performed at pH 6, ambient pH and
   pH 8. In all mixing experiments, copper was released from effluent
   particulate matter when mixing was conducted at pH 6. No copper release
   was observed for mixing at the ambient pH of the samples. At pH 8, no
   copper was released when effluent from the Delcora or Camden POTWs was
   mixed with Delaware River water, but copper was released for Levittown,
   Philadelphia Northeast, Philadelphia Southwest and Gloucester effluents
   mixed with Delaware River water. The fraction dissolved of total
   recoverable copper was evaluated statistically at pH 6, ambient pH and
   pH 8. Because there was no copper released at ambient pH of mixing, we
   conclude that POTWs may be overregulated on the basis of total
   recoverable metal concentration as required by the National Pollutant
   Discharge Elimination-System (NPDES). This is due to the fact that
   effluent particulate copper, which is the majority of the total
   recoverable copper, does not change to dissolved copper at the ambient
   pH of the river. Receiving water quality is evaluated on the basis of
   dissolved copper. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A factor analysis (FA) model with non-negative constraints is used to
   apportion historical records of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)
   sources in seven sediment cores (CLM-A, C, D, E, F, G, and H) from the
   central Lake Michigan (CLM) area. Source apportionment of PAHs is
   important for environmental modeling and management. Instead of PAH
   compound concentrations, averages of total PAH fluxes (the sum of
   sixteen PAHs) into sediments during 5-year periods are used in the FA
   model. As a consequence, apportionment results indicate historical input
   records of sources. A data matrix, based on unmixed and focus-corrected
   total PAH fluxes of seven sediment cores and seven time periods, was
   used in the FA model. From the FA results, modified Wisconsin petroleum
   and coal consumption records are identified for the first and the second
   factors, respectively. The predicted and the Wisconsin coal profiles
   exhibit similar trends with peaks for the 1946-1951 and 1968-1973
   periods. The patterns of predicted and actual profiles for petroleum are
   also similar, however, predicted values are lower than actual values
   after 1964. Results From the petroleum profile analysis may indicate a
   limitation of the FA model when coefficients of variation are not
   constant over the entire period of study. Factor score results show the
   separation of the cores into two groups. Cores A, C, D, and E are
   affected significantly (>36\%) by coal and to some extent petroleum
   point sources (Port Washington and Milwaukee) whereas cores F, G, and H,
   are impacted mainly (> 76\%) by diffuse petroleum sources with a weak
   coal component. This is consistent with the prevailing southwestern wind
   direction and chemical mass balance (CMB) model results for individual
   PAHs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a fundamental relationship between the pH, volatile fatty
   acid (VFA) concentration and alkalinity in prefermenters. Once the
   relationship is established, wastewater treatment plant operators can
   estimate on-line the VFA concentration in a prefermenter at any time
   from pH measurements. Parameters in the model can either be measured at
   some reference point for the wastewater in question, such as the
   prefermenter inlet, or be established by measuring the pH and VFA values
   at two different points (e.g. influent to and effluent from a
   prefermenter). Using this relationship, the VFA concentration can then
   be estimated for any measured pH value, without knowing the alkalinity
   in the system. The analysis relies on a number of simplifying
   assumptions, which can be relaxed at the expense of a more complicated
   predictive model and additional chemical analyses. We have collated pH
   and VFA data from four different prefermentation systems and show that
   the correspondence between model prediction and measured values is good.
   The measured pH values and VFA concentrations are related to each other
   via the alkalinity of the wastewater. The relationship can be used to
   monitor prefermenter performance (with respect to VFA production rates)
   from pH measurements alone, without the need to measure VFA
   concentrations. It can also be applied to simple or model-based control
   strategies for prefermentation processes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Manganese removal using a biological trickling filter was investigated.
   Manganese removal was found to be caused by both biological and chemical
   manganese oxidation. The extent of each oxidation type was assessed. The
   performance of the trickling filter was tested under both continuous and
   sequencing batch reactor operation. The effectiveness and throughput for
   each operational mode were determined as a function of retention time
   and the advantages of each operational mode were investigated. It was
   found that the continuous operational mode leads to higher percentage of
   manganese removal but lower throughput rates when compared with a
   sequencing batch reactor operation with the same feed concentration and
   retention time. A series of experiments was also performed in order to
   investigate the interactions between ammonia, iron and manganese removal
   when simultaneously present in a biological filter. For low ammonia
   concentrations there is no serious inhibition of manganese removal. For
   higher ammonia concentrations inhibition of manganese removal becomes
   substantial. The presence of iron affects both ammonia and manganese
   removal negatively, while ammonia and manganese do not significantly
   affect iron removal. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sonolysis and photolysis are compared for the transformation of
   chlorpropham, a systemic herbicide belonging to the carbamate group, and
   3-chloroaniline, the main intermediate often observed in the degradation
   of chlorpropham. In both cases the ultrasonic degradation is much more
   efficient at 482 kHz than at 20 kHz. The main identified sonoproducts
   formed in the degradation of chlorpropham are 3-chloroaniline, formic
   acid, carbon monoxide and dioxide and chloride ions. The degradation of
   3-chloroaniline also leads to Cl-, CO and CO2 but chlorohydroquine was
   also detected as an intermediate. Two different mechanisms are involved
   in the ultrasonic transformation: pyrolysis resulting from the implosion
   of cavitation microbubbles and oxidation by hydroxyl radicals formed by
   sonolysis of water. Photolysis is more specific: 3-chloroaniline is
   initially quantitatively transformed into 3-aminophenol. A heterolytic
   mechanism is suggested. Resorcinol and some unidentified phoroproducts
   are formed in a second stage. The same type of reaction is involved in
   the photo-transformation of chlorpropham, but the reaction is not so
   specific. Ln both cases the photolysis at 254 nm leads to a complete
   disappearance of phenolic and quinonic compounds. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The treatment of urban surface runoff is steadily becoming common
   practice. Good management of treatment works requires an understanding
   of the first flush phenomenon of wet weather flow in urban drainage
   systems. The objective of this paper is to analyse evidence for the
   existence and nature of the first flush load of pollution input into
   drainage systems, using data on suspended solids, conductivity, pH, and
   temperature of storm surface runoff. The data were collected
   continuously for almost a year for single road inlets at two urban
   asphalt catchments (in Belgrade, Yugoslavia and Lund, Sweden).
   Cumulative load curves were constructed for all monitored water quality
   characteristics, and the pollution load carried by the first 20\% of
   runoff, FF20, was calculated for each recorded event. FF20 values were
   analysed using standard statistical methods, including multiple
   regression. Only slight first flush effects for suspended solids and
   conductivity of storm runoff were observed at both catchments. No first
   flush effect was recorded for pH or temperature. The rainfall acid
   runoff characteristics which influence the first flush phenomenon are
   different at each catchment studied, although the catchments have very
   similar characteristics. It was concluded that: (1) the first flush, if
   strongly present at the end of a drainage system, is not generated by
   the first flush of pollution input; (2) regression curves are not very
   reliable for prediction of the first flush load of pollution input into
   drainage systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing legislative emphasis is being placed on the use of biological
   indices in water quality assessments. The majority of current techniques
   have been developed for use in standing waters. Similar techniques are
   needed which provide in situ biological assessments of flowing waters,
   which should intrinsically include all of the time-integrated factors
   controlling algal growth. This paper presents a biomonitor which uses 3
   alginate-immobilised algal species, and shows its practical use by
   measuring growth responses in two contrasting tributaries of the R. Dee.
   Growth was quantified using a non-destructive, automated absorbance scan
   (650 nm) across the surface of nylon-supported, thin (similar to 1 mm)
   films of alginate-immobilised algal cells. Significant differences (P <
   0.001) occurred between growth responses at the two sites, and between
   the responses of individual algal species. These data are compared with
   the results obtained from a laboratory-based, free-cell bioassay, which
   suggested that growth was not being limited by either nitrogen or
   phosphorus added at 10 and 1 mu g cm(-3) respectively. The two methods
   provided consistent assessments of the water quality, although for
   different reasons; the eutrophic status of one river meant further N and
   P additions were not significant, and the chemical properties of a
   second river, such as pH, may have been the growth-limiting factors.
   This preliminary field assessment shows the alginate film method is
   sensitive, tough and durable, and allows continual, site-specific,
   assessment of water quality. We also discuss the adaptability and
   potential standardisation of this bioassessment method. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The project described in this paper consists of two main stages the
   development of a dedicated instrument enabling continuous simultaneous
   measures of industrial pollutants (e.g. metal ions: Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+...)
   and the design of a Real-time Expert System (RTES) which would provide
   better information and decision support so as to improve the supervision
   of waste-water treatment plants in real-time, applied to the surface
   treatment (electroplating) industries. The sensor is based on the
   principle of spectral absorption analysis. The real-time expert system
   is being developed using a commercial, industrially validated
   RTES-development software G2(TM) (by Gensym Corp.). A mixed
   knowledge-base is being implemented, comprising both types of knowledge:
   quantitative (e.g. theoretical knowledge issued from chemistry) and
   qualitative (i.e. operators' `experience and know-how'). (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to understand the mechanisms involved in the
   formation of bubbles obtained by the release of pressurized water
   through a nozzle in the dissolved air flotation process. To do this,
   nozzles were simulated by glass tubes with a constriction (Reynolds
   tubes). A micro-cinematographic technique was used to visualize the
   phenomena of release in the restriction of the Reynolds tubes. The
   influence of the surface energy of these tubes and of the presence of
   NALCO polyelectrolytes in the water on the release phenomena were
   studied. Gas pockets appear when pressurized water is released. These
   pockets form in the liquid phase if the tubes are hydrophilic. On the
   other hand, they appear at specific points of the tube surface when the
   tubes are hydrophobic. In both cases, the shape of the pockets is
   greatly dependent on the conical divergence angle, beta, of the Reynolds
   tubes. These mechanisms of pressurized water release are not influenced
   by the presence of NALCO polyelectrolytes. (C) 1988 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Our aim was to study the parameters influencing the size of bubbles
   formed by the release of water under pressure through a nozzle in the
   dissolved air flotation process. The nozzles were simulated by glass
   tubes with a constriction (Reynolds tubes). A micro-cinematographic
   technique was used to visualize of the bubbles formed. We were
   particularly interested in the influence of a physical parameter (the
   tube geometry) and some physical-chemical parameters (connected with the
   surface energy of the tubes and the composition of the water). Tube
   geometry plays a key role: The greater the conical divergence angle, the
   greater the degree of turbulence and the smaller the bubbles obtained.
   On the other hand, the coalescence of bubbles on the walls of
   hydrophobic tubes leads to the formation of Electrobubbles. Surfactants
   and ethanol encourage the largest bubbles to break up into microbubbles.
   Electrolytes, by reducing electrostatic repulsion, favour bubble
   coalescence. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Desorpiion of 2,5,2',5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-52) and
   2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153)from suspended sediment
   particles has been studied in a gas stripping reactor. Physical
   properties of the sediment particles such as particle size distribution,
   pore size distribution, surface area and organic carbon content were
   independently measured. Experimental results indicated that PCB
   desorption can be characterized by: (1) two-stage behavior (i.e., an
   initial rapid desorption followed by a prolonged slower desorption); (2)
   a dependence on K-ow; (3) an independence of the first stage and a
   dependence of the second stage on particle size; and (4) a dependence on
   equilibration time (aging effect). The equilibration time tested ranged
   from one month to three years. The aging effect observed in this study
   suggests that release rates of PCBs in natural systems are likely much
   lower than those observed in short-term laboratory experiments,
   indicating not only that a kinetic model should be used in many aquatic
   system models, but also that kinetic constants obtained in short-term
   laboratory experiments may not be directly applicable to the desorption
   process in natural systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A two-compartment diffusion model has been developed and applied to
   simulate the desorption kinetics of two PCB congeners
   {[}2,5,2',5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB-52) and
   2,4,5,2',4',5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (PCB-153)] from suspended aquatic
   sediments (experimental results presented in the preceding paper).
   Simulation results suggest that (1) both non-equilibrium sorption and
   non-uniform particle size distribution of the natural sediments used in
   this study may have contributed to the observed two-distinct-rate
   desorption behavior of PCBs; and (2) that the two-compartment diffusion
   model, which assumes that one fraction of PCBs in solid phase reaches an
   instantaneous equilibrium with the surrounding aqueous phase while the
   other fraction follows intraparticle diffusion, fits the data far better
   than the single retarded pore diffusion model. Simulation results
   further suggest that increasing adsorption equilibration time (aging)
   will generally decrease the instantaneous equilibrium fraction and the
   effective pore diffusion coefficient. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This research program investigated the total nitrogen removal
   capabilities of two pre-denitrification systems treating methanogenic
   municipal landfill leachate. During the startup phase, which is the
   focus of this paper, the ammonia concentration of the leachate was
   artificially and incrementally increased from about 200 mg NL
   ({''}base{''}) to 1200 mg N/L ({''}target{''}) to simulate higher
   strength wastes. The initial attempt to reach the target ammonia
   concentration resulted in the accumulation of ammonia in both systems,
   with eventual nitrification failure. The second attempt was successful,
   with the only difference in procedures being the rate at which an
   external carbon source (methanol) was added to support anoxic
   denitrification. Preliminary data obtained from both systems, during the
   startup phase, indicated that the addition of external carbon to the
   anoxic reactor could significantly affect system performance during
   initial startup and operation. Firstly, the simultaneous increase in
   carbon loading with ammonia loading, to enable high rates of anoxic
   denitrification, was found to result in greater heterotrophic
   assimilation of ammonia in the anoxic reactor (i.e: 30\% vs 10\%)
   compared to the case when carbon loadings were not increased to match
   NOx production. The higher rate of anoxic ammonia assimilation. during
   the second attempt, was sufficient to supplement nitrification ammonia
   removal and prevent the accumulation of ammonia within the systems.
   Secondly, during the first attempt, it was found that increasing anoxic
   carbon loadings, after ammonia had accumulated in the systems, with the
   intent of increasing denitrification and assimilating excess ammonia,
   ultimately resulted in complete failure of nitrification. The increased
   denitrification returned additional alkalinity to the systems and
   resulted in reactor pH levels increasing by about 1 pH unit. The
   increase in pH raised the ``free{''} ammonia fraction, of ``total{''}
   ammonia, by almost an order of magnitude. It is believed that increases
   in aerobic ``free{''} ammonia levels, resulting from the existing
   ``total{''} ammonia levels and the increased pH, caused the
   nitrification failure. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. Atl rights

Abstract = {{Pilot scale GAC columns (1 m x 140 mm i.d.) were fed ozonated river
   water containing atrazine at concentrations of 0.5, 10 or 20 mu g l(-1).
   Columns were inoculated with an atrazine degrading bacterium Rhodococcus
   rhodochrous strain SL1. At the start of the experiment, gradual
   introduction of SL1 into the GAC column over a period of 30 min improved
   retention of inoculant, compared to rapid (< 10 s) injection. Influent
   and effluent atrazine and atrazine adsorbed to GAC were measured and
   populations of SL1 and indigenous bacteria associated with the GAC were
   monitored for 467 d. Inoculation extended ``bed life{''} (i.e. defined
   as the time before ``breakthrough{''} of atrazine in the effluent
   consistently exceeded the EU maximum admissible concentration of 100 ng
   l(-1)) by a minimum of 41 calendar days or 39 operational days (an
   increase of 14.5\% dr 20.5\% over non-inoculated columns). A definition
   which considers the first time breakthrough occurs as significant, gives
   equivalent figures of 40.2\% or 81.7\%. The effect of inoculation on
   reducing effluent atrazine concentration was greatest in the first 232 d
   of the experiment but was recorded until day 351, by which time an
   indigenous atrazine degrading population had become established in the
   non-inoculated columns. SL1 competed well against indigenous bacteria,
   however periodic reinoculation was required to maintain numbers above
   the threshold level (> 1 x 10(5) g(-1) GAG). Significantly, the pilot
   plant was subject to a series of disruptions and shutdowns throughout
   the experiment, but the resilience of the bioregeneration method was
   demonstrated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Production of nitrous oxide in a multifed anoxic filter was found during

   carbon source for denitrification) and urea hydrolysis. Nitrous oxide
   was detected during overloading periods being its concentration
   increasing in the gas phase when formaldehyde accumulates. 1.0\% of
   nitrous oxide in the gas phase was measured when formaldehyde
   concentration was increased up to 1500 mg l(-1) in the feeding and the
   loading rate from 1.5 to 6 g l(-1) d(-1). Formaldehyde was found to be
   toxic or inhibitory for denitrification, also observing a 90\% urea
   hydrolysis inhibition at formaldehyde concentration over 300 mg l(-1).
   The presence of nitrous oxide in the gas phase might be used for
   detecting overloading or anomalous working of denitrifying reactors. (C)

Abstract = {{Biowave(TM), a novel process ibr the treatment of sewage, is based on
   the development of a resonant wave motion in a tank. Treatment is
   brought about by biofilms attached to arrays of parallel plates in the
   tank. These biofilms are alternately wetted by the wastewater and
   exposed to air. The plates are arranged parallel to the direction of
   wave-motion resulting in a very energy efficient device - the only
   energy required is that to overcome friction between moving water and
   the plates. The unit produced a very high quality effluent at all loads
   tested. The commercially available wave generator, a floating plastic
   sphere with an internal motor driving a weight oscillating on a vertical
   shaft, supplied by the WOW company of Belgium, has been used
   successfully to demonstrate this concept for wastewater treatment. An
   intrinsic limitation caused by placing the drive mechanism inside the
   floating body meant that the unit was tested with a wave-motion of
   greater frequency and lower amplitude than designed. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The bacterivorous activity of ciliates, isolated from constructed
   wetlands employing the root zone method of wastewater treatment, was
   investigated by measuring their grazing rates upon
   fluorescently-labelled bacteria (FLB), specifically Escherichia coli.
   The highest mean grazing rates were recorded for Paramecium spp (1.85
   FLB/cell/min), which was the largest ciliate used in the study, followed
   by oxytrichids (1.104 FLB/cell/min), Halteria (0.648 FLB/cell/min) and
   scuticociliates (0.433 FLB/cell/min), the smallest ciliates used in the
   study. Lowest feeding rates were found in the anaerobes Plagiopyla and
   Caenomorpha, although the experimental conditions are likely to have
   adversely affected these forms. Large variations in grazing rates
   between individual cells from the same populations were observed. The
   proportion of empty cells, i.e. those without ingested FLB, and the
   decrease in the proportion of empty cells with incubation time, showed
   large differences between taxa. The present study indicates that
   ciliates are capable of all observed E. coli removal from wastewaters
   treated in constructed wetlands using the root zone method. However, it
   is unlikely that ciliates ill situ continuously maintain maximum feeding
   rates. A variety of other processes, biotic and abiotic, are thought to
   be involved in the removal of pathogenic nd indicator bacteria such as
   E. coli. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Mycobacterium avium and Legionella pneumophila are opportunistic
   pathogens that are found in hot water systems of hospitals. Hospital
   water supplies have also been suggested as sources for M. avium in AIDS
   patients. Copper/silver ionization has been shown to be an effective
   method for controlling Legionella in hospital hot water systems. The
   effect of copper/silver ions on M. avium is unknown. The susceptibility
   of M. avium to copper/silver ions was tested by performing kill-curve
   experiments in 100 ml buffered water at the following concentrations of
   copper/silver ions: (1) 0.1/0.01; (2) 0.2/0.02; (3) 0.4/0.04; (4)
   0.8/0.08 mg/l. Initial M. avium concentration was ca. 3 x 10(6) CFU/ml.
   Viability was assessed daily for 1 week by plate count on Middlebrook
   7H10 agar, and by the BACTEC system. Culture plates and BACTEC bottles
   were incubated at 37 degrees C for two weeks. Contact times (days)
   required for 99\% and 99.9\% inactivation of M. avium by copper/silver
   ion concentrations of 0.1/0.01; 0.2/0.02; 0.4/0.04; 0.8/0.08 were 3 d
   and 5 d, 3 d and 5 d, 2 d and 4 d, 1 d and 2 d, respectively. The data
   indicate that M. avium is susceptible to these metal ions. However, M.
   avium are more resistant to the bactericidal effects of copper/silver
   ions than Legionella, requiring 100 times longer exposure to achieve
   comparable killing in vitro. Nevertheless, this suggests that the
   copper/silver ionization system may rid hospital hot water systems of
   both of these potential pathogens. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of P and Si additions or. P fluxes and microbial activity in
   sediment were examined using P-33-abeeed surface sediment samples which
   were enriched with P-32 or P-32 + Si. The distribution of both
   P-isotopes between the interstitial water and operationally defined
   solid-phase P fractions was followed for 15 days. The bulk of the P-33
   Sediment label was adsorbed to particles, since only 0.02\% of the
   activity was recovered in the interstitial water after the 4-day
   pre-equilibration before the enrichment treatments. The Si addition
   promoted the desorption of P-33 to the interstitial water and,
   accordingly, retarded the adsorption of P-32 from solution to
   solid-phase. The increase in labile P, measured with anion exchange
   resin-impregnated membranes, indicated that the availability of P was
   enhanced immediately after the Si enrichment as well as at the end of
   the experiment. As a result of the Si addition, the production of
   organic P compounds by bacteria increased (mainly bound to bacterial
   cells) and the phosphatase activity decreased, demonstrating increased
   bioavailability of P. The chemical competition for sorption sites
   between P and Si, observed for soils, seems to be valid also for
   sediments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A nitrifying biofilm airlift suspension reactor (with nitrifiers growing
   in biofilms) was coupled with a denitrifying chemostat (with
   denitrifiers growing in suspension) for integrated nitrogen removal.
   Initially the process was run in post-denitrification setup, during
   which nitrification and denitrification went via nitrate. Later
   recirculation between both reactors was applied (pre-denitrification
   setup), resulting in circulation of the suspended denitrifiers between
   the two reactors. The setup was suitable for nitrification and
   denitrification: 75\% total nitrogen removal efficiency was obtained at
   an aerobic ammonia load of 5 kg(N) m(-3) d(-1). In the
   pre-denitrification setup nitrification and denitrification mainly
   occurred with nitrite as an intermediate. Probably the nitrite oxidisers
   and reducers competed for nitrite, which competition was won by the
   nitrite reducers. A low average COD/N-ratio of 3.0 g(COD) g(N)(-1) was
   obtained, in accordance with the ``nitrite route{''}. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A new concept for ammonium removal from secondary effluent by zeolite
   followed by bioregeneration has been studied. In contrast to other
   studies of hybrid biological-ion exchange multireactor Systems, the
   proposed process uses the ion exchange material, zeolite, as a carrier
   for the nitrifying biomass. Therefore, the entire process is carried out
   in a single reactor. Since all the ammonium from the original effluent
   is concentrated in the zeolite and released gradually during
   regeneration, nitrification is carried out in a small volume reactor in
   an almost batch mode where optimal conditions for nitrification can
   easily be maintained. Moreover, the conversion of ammonium cations to
   nitrate anions allows for regenerate recycle, where the amount of
   chemicals added for desorption is reduced to the amount of sodium
   bicarbonate added as a buffer for nitrification. As a result,
   operational costs and production of large volumes of brine are
   minimized. To achieve sufficient NH4+ concentration in the solution to
   allow for high rate nitrification, the cation-rich regenerant solution
   (or part of it) is reused from one cycle to the next. A theoretical
   model including ion exchange and bioregeneration modes, indicates that
   the total cation concentration and each cation in the recycled
   regenerant should reach constant values after several cycles of
   adsorption-regeneration and remain constant as long as the influent
   characteristics and operation conditions stay similar. Experiments
   results verified the predicted values. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Epipelic diatom assemblages have been used to evaluate water quality in
   the Matanza-Riachuelo river basin.Twenty-three sites were sampled in
   April, May, June and August 1995, before the setup of restoration
   programs. The Matanza-Riachuelo river basin is located in N.E. Buenos
   Aires province. It runs across one of the most industrialized and
   populous zones of Argentina, for which it is subject to strong
   anthropogenic disturbances. A total number of 97 taxa were identified of
   which only 37 were abundant. Navicula cryptocephala, Nitzschia palea and
   N. umbonata occur in the whole basin though more frequent downstream;
   Stephanodiscus hantzschii and Cyclotella meneghiniana develop where the
   river becomes wider and deeper. The distribution of the diatomoloical
   flora in the Matanza-Riachuelo basin was affected by the increasing
   concentration of organic matter carried by the river and downstream for
   the input of chemical compounds, several of which are toxic to aquatic
   life (i.e. heavy metals, phenols, hydrocarbon, etc.). The assemblage was
   dominated by pollution-tolerant species, which implies strong to very
   strong contamination in a great portion of the basin. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The two fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) thar are currently used in
   laundry detergents in Switzerland (DAS 1, a diaminostilbene, and DSBP, a
   distyrylbiphenyl) were studied in ten different Swiss rivers.
   Two-week-composite-samples were analyzed once a month for 1 year. In
   most of the investigated rivers, concentrations ranged from 6-120 ng
   l(-1) for DAS 1 and from 10-70 ng l(-1) for DSBP. Average per capita
   loads were 1.8 and 1.3 mg d(-1) inhabitant(-1) for DAS 1 and DSBP,
   respectively. Higher concentrations were found in rivers with densely
   populated catchment areas and below FWA manufacturing plants (DAS 1:
   100-1000 ng l(-1); DSBP: 50-1100 ng l(-1)). Only sampling locations
   situated below FWA manufacturing plants showed significantly increased
   per capita loads compared to the other stations investigated (8.0 mg DAS
   1 d(-1) inhabitant at Well (below Basel) on the river Rhine; 23.1 mg
   DSBP d(-1) inhabitant(-1) at Forte du Scex on the river Rhone). Thus,
   these FWAs can be applied as molecular markers for production
   wastewater. The measurements made in Swiss rivers allowed for the
   development of a mass balance for FWAs. This mass balance indicates that
   13\% of the FWAs being used are discharged to surface waters. (C) 1998

   in the River Loire-Val d'Orleans hydrologic system (Fig. 1), make
   possible flow velocities up to 200 m h(-1 a) and provide convenient
   access to different water samples several tens of km apart, at both

   of the regional limestone bedrock (Calcaires de Beauce). Recharge by
   seepage waters From the local catchment basin is small (Zunino, C.,
   Bonnet, M. and Lelong, F. (1980) Le Val d'Orleans: un exemple d'aquifere
   a alimentation laterale. C. R. somm. Soc. Geol. Fr. 5, 195-199; Gonzalez
   R. (1992) Etude de l'organisation et evaluation des echanges entre la
   Loire moyenne et l'aquifere des calcaires de Beauce. These, Universite
   d'Orleans) and negligible in summer. This karstic hydrologic: system is
   the largest in France in terms of flow (tens to hundreds of m(3)/s) and
   provides the main water resource of the city of Orleans. Chemical
   compositions of influent waters (River Loire) and effluent waters
   (spring of the river Loiret) were compared, in particular during floods
   in summer 1992 and 1993 (Figs 2-4). Variation of chloride in the River
   Loire during the stream rise can be used as an environmental tracer of
   the underground flow (Fig. 2).
   Short transit times of about 3 days are detectable (Fig, 2) which are
   consistent with earlier estimations obtained with chemical tracers (Ref.
   in Chery, J.-L. (1983) These, Universite d'Orleans). Depending on the
   hydrological regime of the river, organic carbon discharge ranges
   between 3-7 and 2-13 mg/l for dissolved and particulate matter
   respectively (Fig. 3). Eutrophic characteristics and high algal
   biomasses are found in the River Loire during low water (Lair, N. and
   Sargos, D. (1993) A 10 year study at four sites of the middle course of
   the River Loire. I - Patterns of change in hydrological, physical and
   chemical variables in relation to algal biomass. Hudroecol. Appl. 5,
   1-27) together with more organic carbon rich suspended particulate
   matter than during floods (30-40 C(org) \% dry weight versus 5-10\%).
   Amounts of total organic carbon and dissolved oxygen (Fig. 3)
   dramatically decrease during the underground transport, whereas
   conversely, dissolved calcium, alkalinity and inorganic carbon increase
   (Fig. 4).
   Anoxia of outflows map start in April. Dissolution of calcium carbonates
   along the influent path outweighs closed system calcite equilibrium of
   inflow river waters (Table 3). The impact of organic matter oxidation on
   calcite dissolution may be traced by variations of alkalinity and total
   carbonates in water. Following, Jacobs, L. A., von Gunten, H. R., Keil,
   R. and Kuslys, M. (1988) Geochemical changes along a river-groundwater
   infiltration flow path: Glattfelden, Switzerland. Geochim. Cosmochim.
   Acta 52, 2693-2706), results are shown graphically (Fig. 5). Extent of
   reactions is controlled by the consumption of dissolved O(2) and nitrate
   for organic matter oxidation and by the release of Ca(2+) for calcite
   dissolution (Table 2). The karstic network is considered to behave like
   a biological reactor not exchanging with the atmosphere, with steady
   inhabitant microbial communities (Mariotti A., Landreau A, and Simon B.
   (1988) (15)N isotope biogeochemisrry and natural denitrification process
   in groundwater: Application to the chalk aquifer of northern France.
   Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 52, 1869-1878; Gounot, A.-M. (1991) Ecologie
   microbienne des eaux ei des sediments souterrains. Hydrogeologie,
   239-248). Thus, energy requirements only are considered, not carbon
   assimilation. Moreover, there is no necessity to invoke any delay for
   nitrification enhancement, as observed elsewhere, after waste water
   discharge into the river (Chesterikoff, A., Garban, B., Billen, G. and
   Poulin, M. (1992) Inorganic nitrogen dynamics in the River Seine
   downstream from Paris (France). Biogeochem. 17, 147-164). Main microbial
   processes are assumed to be aerobic respiration, nitrification and
   denitrification. Reactions with iron and manganese, real but not
   quantitatively important, were neglected. Sulphate reduction and methane
   formation, certainly not active, were not considered.
   Denitrification, which is suggested by low nitrate and ammonium
   concentrations and anoxia in the outflow, is known to be rapid enough to
   be achieved in a short time (Dupain, S. (1992) Denitrification
   biologique heterotrophe appliquee au traitement des eaux d'alimentation:
   Conditions de fonclionnement et mise au point d'un procede. These,
   Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon). Reaction are somewhat arbitrary but
   conform to general acceptance (Morel, M. M. and Hering, J. G. (1993)
   Principles and Applications of Aquatic Chemistry. Wiley, New York).
   Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (Mulder A., van de Graaf, A. A., Robertson,
   L: A. and Kuenen, J. G. (1995) Anaerobic ammonium oxidation discovered
   in a denitrifying fluidized bed reactor. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 16,
   177-184). although possible, was not considered. In fact, C/N ratio of
   the reactive organic matter has only mild repercussions on the results;
   i.e. in the same range as the analytical errors for alkalinity and total
   carbonates. The objective was simply to roughly confront characteristics
   of outflowing waters and the calculation. Respective roles of aerobes
   and denitrifiers, for instance, are not certain. Several periods during
   low water or floods were selected with various ranges for calcium
   dissolution or nitrate and oxygen concentrations. The result is that in
   most cases simulation and data are in reasonable accordance (Fig. 5).
   Amounts of organic matter in River Loire are generally sufficient to
   sustain the process (Table 3. Particulate organic matter is probably the
   most reactive. The balance of oxidation of organic matter indicates that
   about 65 mu g C(org)/l.h are oxidized during the transport without much
   variation with the river regime or organic discharge. It is concluded
   that limestone dissolution is directly dependent on organic matter
   oxidation, but variation occurs (7-29 mg CuCO(3)/l) with the level of
   bases that can be neutralized in the River Loire water. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Ethanol is frequently found along with benzene, toluene, and xylenes
   (BTX) in groundwater contaminated with gasoline. Yet, little is known
   about its effect on bioremediation of the toxic BTX contaminants.
   Aquifer microcosms were used to investigate the effect of ethanol on
   microbial degradation of representative BTX compounds under electron
   acceptor conditions commonly found in intrinsic bioremediation projects.
   Under aerobic conditions, ethanol retarded BTX biodegradation and
   exacerbated the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Anoxic conditions
   developed quickly when the BOD exerted by ethanol exceeded the available
   oxygen. This led to the persistence of benzene, which was also
   recalcitrant in denitrifying, sulfidogenic, and methanogenic microcosms
   during 99 days of incubation. Toluene was degraded under all anaerobic
   electron acceptor conditions tested, although the onset of relatively
   fast degradation always commenced after ethanol bad been removed.
   Toluene degradation was not Significantly affected by ethanol in
   denitrifying microcosms containing excess nitrate. Yet, no toluene
   degradation occurred when nitrate was limiting because nitrate was
   depleted while ethanol was being degraded. Ethanol also adversely
   affected toluene degradation in iron-reducing and methanogenic
   microcosms. Curiously, ethanol enhanced toluene degradation;in sulfate
   reducing microcosms. This was hypothesized to be due to a low initial
   concentration of toluene degraders and their incidental growth during
   ethanol! degradation. Albeit, the preferential utilization of ethanol
   and the accompanying depletion of electron accepters suggest that
   ethanol would have a negative effect on passive BTX bioremediation. This
   is particularly important for the fare of benzene, which is the most
   toxic of the BTX and the most recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions.

Abstract = {{The hyphenation of continuous-flow extraction with electrothermal atomic
   absorption spectrometry as a means for studies of the partition of metal
   complexes between n-octanol and water has been further mechanised. It is
   now possible to separate cleanly either the n-octanol or the aqueous
   phase after equilibration and measure their metal concentrations
   sequentially by the electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometer. The
   mechanised method can therefore now exclude the effects of flow
   variations and precipitation or absorption of metal in the system. The
   repeatability of the metal determinations by the complete system is
   good. In most cases, RSDs below 5\% were obtained for determinations in
   either n-octanol or water. The precision of an evaluated conditional
   partition constant, measured as the standard deviation (SD) of the mean
   log D' value, is better than 0.1. The time needed for one determination
   is about 20 min. Quantitative partition data were obtained using this
   system by determining the conditional partition constants (D') for Cd
   and Cu complexes with diethyldithiocarbamate and humic/fulvic acids.
   Uncharged metal complexes with diethyl dithiocarbamate are hydrophobic
   and complex formation thus increases sharply the hydrophobicity of the
   metals. Humic/fulvic acids have hydrophillic parts not taking part in
   complexation and their complexes with Cd and Cu are therefore still
   hydrophillic. The direct uptake of Cd and Cu via lipid-soluble complexes
   with humic/fulvic acids is therefore hardly significant. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{An experimental study was performed to observe the effect of electron
   acceptor conditions on the enzyme activities in an anaerobic-aerobic
   activated sludge sequencing batch reactor (SBR). Four types of
   extra-cellular enzymes, i.e. alkaline phosphatase; acid phosphatase,
   alpha-glucosidase and protease were selected for the study. In addition
   to these enzymes, dehydrogenase, an intracellular enzyme, was also
   assayed. A lab scale anaerobic-aerobic SBR was operated and used for the
   experimental work. It was observed that the specific enzyme activities
   did not chance significantly during anaerobic and aerobic phase of SBR.
   The enzymatic behavior of sludge observed under anaerobic and aerobic
   conditions was explained by considering three important factors: (1)
   enzyme synthesis under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, (2) location of
   enzymes, and (3) stability of enzymes in activated sludge. Based on the
   experimental results, it was established that, even though synthesis of
   the enzyme is to some extent affected depending on the anaerobic and
   aerobic incubation, it is the stable and the flee bound nature of these
   extra-cellular enzymes which results in no significant difference in
   enzyme activity under anaerobic and aerobic phase of a steady state
   operated single sludge anaerobic-aerobic system. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The adsorption-desorption behaviour of seven pesticides and metabolites
   with different physiochemical properties in sediments of the
   Teufelsweiher pond (area: 3155 m(2), depth: 0.3-1.3 m) in Southern
   Germany has been studied employing a batch technique. Atrazine and
   bifenox, which have been detected in the pond sediments, showed
   different competitive effects: the adsorption of the relatively weak
   sorbing atrazine was slightly reduced in the presence of the stronger
   adsorbing bifenox, whereas the sorption of bifenox was less affected by
   competition of atrazine at a. concentration range of 1-5 mg l(-1) The
   desorbed amounts of aged atrazine and bifenox residues were two or three
   orders of magnitude smaller than in other experiments with the same
   sediment recently incubated with these pesticides. in addition, the
   apparent desorption coefficients(K-fapp) of the aged residues were
   approximately 3 and 16 times higher than those of recent incubations
   with atrazine and bifenox, respectively. This time-dependent desorption
   strongly suggests that the concentrations of atrazine and bifenox in
   natural waters are likely to be substantially lower than these predicted
   from laboratory-determined desorption coefficients. The dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) also exhibited a significant effect on pesticide
   adsorption-desorption behaviour. The pesticides can be bound to UOC
   resulting in higher total concentrations of pesticides in the pore-water
   and a decreased K-d. This ``solubilization effect{''} may be important
   for enhancing the desorption and facilitating the transport of
   contaminants in the aquatic environment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The air/water exchange velocity of thirteen volatile organic compounds
   was investigated in laboratory stirred tank experiments. A standardized
   setup was used so that the exchange of VOCs could be examined as a
   function of the level of turbulence, expressed by the Reynolds number.
   The exchange rate showed an exponential correlation with the level of
   turbulence. The commonly used relationship, in which the air/water
   exchange rate of volatile organic compounds is calculated from the
   reaeration rate by introducing a factor equal to the ratio of the
   diffusion coefficients, raised to the power n, showed an exponent n =
   0.56 +/- 0.05. It was statistically proven that this relationship is
   valid both in the transient and turbulent regime of the water system.
   The imposed degree of turbulence did give rise to reaeration and
   volatilization rates of the same order as in riverine systems, so that
   the obtained functional relationship can be applied in these
   environmental systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{N2O emission from activated sludge basins is the net result of microbial
   production and consumption of N2O. In this study semicontinuous and
   batch laboratory scale experiments were carried out with activated
   sludge from a Danish waste water treatment plant in order to elucidate
   important parameters in N2O production under oxic and anoxic conditions.
   To distinguish between N2O production from NH4+ and NO2- oxidation under
   oxic conditions, C2H2 and ClO3- were used as selective inhibitors. Our
   study showed that most of the N2O produced was reduced to N-2 under
   anoxic conditions. Shorter N2O residence times in the sludge resulted in
   more N2O produced. Most of the N2O emission occurred under oxic
   conditions, probably because the reduction to N-2 was inhibited by O-2.
   We suggest a coupling between NH4+ oxidation and NO2- reduction
   (nitrifier-denitrification) as responsible for the majority of the N2O
   produced under oxic conditions, since NH4+ oxidation and high NO2-
   concentrations stimulated N2O production. Increasing temperature, NH4+
   and dissolved O-2 concentrations enhanced this effect. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Intensive sampling of acid mine drainage from adits draining the
   abandoned copper and sulphur mines at Avoca, south-east Ireland, has
   confirmed a seasonal variation in the Zn:Cu ratio observed previously.
   The variation in the Zn:Cu ratio leads to extreme variations in the
   toxicity of the drainage, and linked with increased adit flows and
   surface runoff during wetter months, often results in higher river
   toxicity, even during high river discharge rates. This seasonal
   variation in toxicity has important ramifications for the control of AMD
   to surface waters. Sampling over a three-year period shows that the rate
   of discharge from the adits follows a seasonal cycle being high in the
   spring, declining through summer to reach lowest flows in autumn and
   rising again in the winter. During the intensive sampling study over a
   13-month period, the discharge rate in the Deep Adit varied from 8.5 to
   37.3 l/s compared to 6.3 to 35.2 l/s in the Ballymurtagh Adit. This
   represents a total discharge rate for the two adits of between 1265 and
   6270 m(3)/d. Significant weights of cations were discharged from the two
   adits, ranging from 169-1279 kg/d for Fe, 69-459 kg/d for Zn, 1.5-34.7
   kg/d for Cu, and 0.167-0.875 kg/d for Cd, with the Deep Adit
   contributing on average 40.4, 70.4, 66.7 and 80.9\% of each metal
   respectively over the sampling period of 13 months. The impact of AMD on
   the river biota is severe with a major decrease in the number of taxa
   and faunal abundance. The species deficit at all sires below the mines
   is in excess of 87\%. Dipterans dominate impacted sites with
   Chironomidae abundant. Fish are eliminated except for juvenile eels
   close to the estuary. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{High efficiency activated carbons with various chemical characteristics,
   appropriate for the purification of waste and potable water with
   different pollutions(trihalomethanes, metal ions)were prepared. A
   suitable selection of both raw materials and activating agents as well

   established that activated carbon obtained from apricot stones by
   pyrolysis in a flow of water;vapour (PWV method) can be used for removal
   of trihalomethanes from water treated with chlorine. Activated carbons
   obtained from apricot stones and lignites by the same method as well as
   oxidized anthracite can be used for removal of Pb2+ and Zn2+ ions from
   potable water. The chemical character of these carbon surfaces favours
   to a larger extent hemosorption of metal ions. Carbon obtained by
   steam-activation when used for water purification promotes the formation
   of nitrites; This hindrance can be eliminated by a suitable oxidation
   treatment of the carbon. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) are algae metabolites with
   muddy/musty odors which contaminate water supplies and can be absorbed
   by aquatic organisms. Humans can perceive them in water and aquatic food
   products at ng/l (parts per trillion) concentrations. A rapid method
   employing solid phase micro extraction (SPME) has been developed for the
   analysis of GSM and MIB in water. Routine quantification at mu g/l
   concentrations can be accomplished using gas chromatography and flame
   ionization detection (FID) on a 6 ml aqueous sample with a total
   analysis time of less than 15 min. Concentration levels of MIB and GSM
   at 10 ng/l (parts per trillion) can be detected under optimal conditions
   employing GC/MS in selected ion monitoring mode. Standard solutions and
   water samples from MIB producing algae cultures were used to compare
   SPME against purge and trap (P\&T) using both flame ionization and mass
   spectrometric detection. Results obtained from SPME and PET were similar
   in terms of reproducibility and sensitivity. This paper reports a
   simple, rapid method for monitoring the algal production of MIB and GSM
   at the mu g/l range which can be extended to the drinking water levels
   at the ng/l range of concentrations. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A human astrovirus (HAstV)-specific oligonucleotide probe was utilised
   for the identification of HAstV-specific sequences in reverse
   transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cDNA amplicons using
   either of two published primers pairs, both of which reportedly detect
   all known HAstV serotypes. The two sets of primers, designated Mon and
   J7, amplify 89 bp and 77 bp regions in the conserved 3'-end of the HAstV
   genome, respectively. An overlapping region of 59 bp is amplified by
   both primer pairs and the 30 bp oligonucleotide probe was designed to be
   homologous to a sequence within this overlapping region. Cell culture
   amplification in the human primary liver carcinoma cell line, PLC/PRF/5,
   and the human colonic carcinoma cell line, CaCo-2, prior to using the
   RT-PCR-oligonucleotide probe assay was assessed for enhanced detection
   of wild type HAstVs in environmental waters. The PLC/PRF/5 cells were
   shown to be more effective than the CaCo-2 cells for enhancing the
   detection of HAstVs. This RT-PCR-oligonucleotide probe assay with the
   Mon primer pair, in conjunction with cell culture amplification in the
   PLC/PRF/5 cell line, provides a sensitive and specific assay for the
   detection of wild type HAstVs in environmental waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of environmental abiotic factors on survival and activity of
   oil degrading isolates, Pseudomonas aeruginosa OD-1 and Candida albicans
   OD-2, was determined in situ using membrane diffusion chambers. The
   study sites were located in a tropical bay on the Atlantic Ocean with
   history of petroleum contamination by oil tankers. Microbial densities
   were measured by direct counts. H-3-thymidine uptake,
   microautoradiography, INT-reduction, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and
   frequency of dividing cells were used to assess microbial activity. Both
   organisms showed a significant decrease in cell density over a three day
   period, although, temporal increases in densities were observed.
   Significant decreases in total activity vr;ere observed ibr both
   populations during the study; however, the respiration potential and ATP
   content per organism remained constant or even increased by the end of
   the study suggesting that a significant fraction of these populations
   were capable of withstanding in situ environmental conditions. Results
   suggest that increases in ambient phosphorus concentrations played a
   role in the prolonged ill situ survival of these petroleum degrading
   isolates at some sites. The traffic of oil tankers might have played a
   significant impact on microbial survival in this bay, as violent
   agitation of sediments increased phosphorus concentrations available to
   microorganisms. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effectiveness of sand coated with aluminum hydroxide by in situ
   precipitation was evaluated over a 4 month period during which the sand
   was exposed to wastewater, Biogrowth in one set of columns was prevented
   by chlorinating its wastewater influent, whereas a parallel set of
   columns received dechlorinated wastewater. Following an initial
   ``conditioning effect{''} (i.e. an increase in bacterial removal
   capacity), bacterial removal capacity of coated sand gradually decreased
   to that of uncoated sand. Biogrowth on the sand accelerated this
   decline. The aluminum content of coated sands decreased by approximately
   25\% over the first two weeks: then remained relatively constant and
   well above that of uncoated sand. Similarly, zeta potential decreased
   over the first two weeks from above + 20 to below -70 mV, which was
   still significantly more electropositive than that of uncoated sand.
   Zeta potential of coated sand without biogrowth subsequently remained
   approximately constant, while that of coated sand with biogrowth
   increased gradually. No apparent correlation was found between metal
   content or zeta potential and bacterial removal capacity. The results
   suggest that, absent of biogrowth, the effective lifetime :of the
   aluminum hydroxide coated sand is approximately 4 months, whereas with
   biogrowth, the effective lifetime is reduced to approximately 3 months.
   This information is of importance for assessing the technological
   potential as well as economical implications of metallic hydroxide
   coating of filter media. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of the charge of humic acid (HA) on the fouling of
   nanofilters was investigated as a Function of pH and concentration of
   calcium ions. The charge of the humic acid as well as the zeta-potential
   of the membrane surface were measured to elucidate the mechanism of
   humic acid deposition on the membrane surface. The negative charge of
   humic acid as well as the negative zeta-potential of the membrane
   surface fouled with humic acid increased with higher pH. As a result the
   further deposition of humic acid on the membrane surface was expected to
   decrease with higher pH because of larger repulsive forces. With
   moderate calcium ion concentration, however, the adsorption of humic
   acid onto the membrane surface decreased until neutral pH and then
   increased again. It was attributed to calcium ion bridging between two
   free functional groups of humic acids. Calcium ion rejection decreased
   in the presence of humic acid deposited on membrane surface. This could
   be explained by the effect of humic acid on the net charge of the
   membrane. The addition of calcium chelating agent, EDTA, improved flux,
   especially at alkaline conditions. The diagram of Ca-EDTA vs pH was used
   to explain the flux improvement. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{There seems to be a general shift in the U.K, and the rest of Europe
   away from copper to the use of stainless steel piping for carrying
   particular ``problem{''} waters in buildings where corrosion has been
   found to cause failures in copper. As stainless steel is a relatively
   new plumbing system few reports are available of its short term and long
   term performance in potable water environments and of differences
   between grades. Results of the development of biofilms on stainless
   steel grades 304 and 316, as an appendage to a large buildings plumbing
   distribution system, after 24 months exposure to potable water are
   presented. The viable cell counts on stainless steel grade 304 pipe
   after 24 months averaged 1.9 x 10(3) cfu cm(-2) compared to 3.2 x 10(2)
   cfu cm(-2) on 316 piping. The viable cell and total cell count on matt
   (2D) finished stainless steel were not significantly higher (p < 0.05)
   when compared to smooth (2B) stainless steel. Total carbohydrate levels
   and bic,mass dry weight levels were slightly higher on 304 stainless
   steel than 316 stainless steel, but were not significantly (p < 0.05)
   different. A mixture of biofilm bacteria attached to stainless steel
   were evident including, Pseudomonas spp., Alcaligenes sp. and
   Corynebacterium/Arthrobacter spp. Metal ions were evident in both 304
   and 316 pipe biofilms. Scanning electron microscopy provided evidence of
   microcolony formation of rod-shaped bacteria and diatoms. Results of the
   development of biofilms on stainless-steel grades 304 and 316, as an
   appendage to a large buildings plumbing distribution system, after 5
   months exposure ro mains water at water-velocities of 0.32, 0.96 and

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal variations in the concentration and flux of the
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the Yichun River, China were
   investigated. It was found that in the summer, DOC in the river water
   originated primarily from allochthonous sources. There was a synchronous
   fluctuation in the DOC contents and flow rate. During the winter season
   when the Ever was totally covered in ice, the autochthonous source
   became dominant and the DOC content was inversely proportional to the
   flow rate simply due to the dilution effect. Two equations were derived
   to estimate DOC levels based on flow rate in the summer and winter,
   respectively. Spatially, the DOC increased downstream throughout the
   year. The annual DOC flux from the Yichun River drainage basin was
   calculated to be 7113 ton/a, or 2.88 gC/m(2).a, among which over 87\%
   occurred during 3 months of the wet season from June to September. (C)

   chemoheterotrophic bacteria has been studied in the activated sludge of

   the bacteria were Zoogloea, Alcaligenes and Pseudomonas, accounting for
   65\% to 85\% of the cultivable species. Most of these bacteria are
   reviviscent after eight days of anaerobiosis, their relative proportion
   remaining practically unchanged. The protozoa and metazoa usually
   present in the sludge disappear over the first three days of absence of
   oxygen, to be replaced by species of the class Diplomonadida, an
   anaerobic phylum. In a pure culture, the Zoogloea and Alcaligenes
   strains from the pilot sludge remain reviviscent after 8 days without
   oxygen, but much less than in the pilot plane. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

   of micro-organisms. This OM defined as the refractory part of
   biodegradation, was divided into hydrophobic and basic, acid and neutral
   hydrophilic fractions by passing. through XAD-8, AGMP-50 and A-21
   columns, respectively. Results obtained before:ind after the
   biodegradation rest were then compared. This fractionation method, for
   determination of refractory OM, is an alternative physico-chemical
   technique to bioassay techniques. Our results foresee the possibility to
   study, without biological tests, refractory and labile OM and improve
   sewage treatment monitoring. Biodegradation results in a significant
   increase of the hydrophobic fraction (around 40\%). This fraction is
   strictly equivalent to humic substances (HS) according to IHSS
   definition.. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the applicability of synchronous
   fluorescence spectroscopy (SFS) in differentiating natural organic
   matter (NOM) from dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from domestic
   wastes and in detecting their presence in Kurose River. Sewage effluent,
   gray water, water extracts from leaf mold and top soil, respectively,
   algal culture media, and water samples from different points of the
   river were analyzed. A laboratory mixing experiment was conducted by
   combining the leaf mold water extract (LM-NOM) and sewage effluent at
   different ratios. The SFS of the samples were run at offset value of
   Delta lambda = 40 nm (Delta lambda = lambda(em)-lambda(ex)). The
   corrected synchronous fluorescence spectra of LM-NOM and the sewage
   effluent showed different spectral features. A very intense peak at
   about 531 nm was observed in the sewage effluent spectrum which was not
   found in the LM-NOM sample. The mixing of fluorescing organic material
   in LM-NOM and sewage effluent resulted in the simple addition of their
   respective spectra. This allows the detection of pollutants in surface
   waters by the appearance of characteristic peaks of the added
   wastewater. The corrected spectra of the river water sample from a
   relatively unpolluted point of Kurose River exhibited a simple spectrum
   with a single peak while the spectra of those collected downstream
   showed peaks similar to those found in the sewage effluent and gray
   water spectra. These results demonstrate the applicability of SFS in
   detecting the presence of different DOM in surface waters. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The three main lakes in Northern Italy (Como, Garda and Maggiore) were
   studied in order to investigate their potential mutagenic activity in
   relation to their present use as drinking water supplies. Lakewater
   samples were collected by an automatic autosampler, concentrated in situ
   with a XAD-2 filled column and tested with the Ames assay (TA98 and
   TA100 strains with and without S9 addition). The results of the Ames
   test show that the highest water mutagenic activity is obtained when
   TA98 strain with S9 mix is used, moreover they indicate higher mutagenic
   response in Come lakewaters than in the two other lake samples. The
   chemical characterization of the water extracts were carried out
   quantifying some agricultural and industrial organic micropollutants
   with GC-NPD techniques and identifying the main water chemical
   composition with GC-MS. The chemical analysis allowed the identification
   of some pollutants that may be responsible for a fraction of the
   observed lake water mutagenicity. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Tests were carried out in order to show the effects of recarbonation on
   the evolution of the biodegradability of natural organic matter during
   ozonation. To achieve this objective, four series of tests were
   conducted on the effluents of one of the sand-anthracite filters at the
   Ste-Rose plant (City of Laval, Canada). Table 1 presents the chemical
   characteristics of these effluents. In performing these four series of
   tests, each sample was divided into four portions. The first portion was
   not modified: this was the filter effluent water with an alkalinity of
   25 mg/l CaCO3. The alkalinity of the other three portions were adjusted
   to 100, 175 and 250 mg/l CaCO3, respectively, by adding increasing
   quantities of sodium bicarbonate. Then, each portion was ozonated at the
   same ozone dose using the apparatus shown in Fig. 1. After ozonation,
   the UV absorbance, the alkalinity and the ozone, oxalate and BDOC
   concentrations were measured. Standard methods as described in APHA et
   al. (1992) {[}APHA, AWWA and WEF (1992) Standard Methods for the
   Examination of Water and Wastewater. Washington, D.C.] were used for
   alkalinity and ozone measurements. BDOC measurements were based on a
   modified version of the Joret and Levi method {[}Joret, J. C. and Li vi,
   Y. (1986) Methode rapide d'evaluation du carbone eliminable des eaux par
   voie biologique. Trib. Cebedeau 39, 3-9; Joret, J. C., Levi, Y., Dupin,
   T. and Gilbert, M. (1988) Rapid method for estimating bioeliminable
   organic carbon in water. AWWA 1988 Annual Conference, pp. 1715-1725.
   Orlando, Florida.] and on the Servais Billen method {[}Servais, P.,
   Anzil, A., Ventresque, C., (1989) Simple method for determination of
   biodegrable dissolved organic carbon in water. Appl. Environ. Microbiol.
   55(10), 2732-2734.]. These tests were performed four times at one-month
   intervals using filter effluent from the same filter each time. An ozone
   dose of 0.2 mg O-3/mg DOC was used for the first series of tests. The
   ozone doses for the other series were 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 mg O-3/mg DOC
   respectively. Table 2 indicates the average ozonation conditions. These
   tests gave the following principal results. in one series (fixed ozone
   dose and an alkalinity ranging between 25 and 250 mg/l CaCO3), the
   reduction in UV absorbance increased with alkalinity. For the first
   series of tests, this reduction measured 40\% in water whose alkalinity
   was 25 mg/l CaCO3 and increased to 50\% in water whose alkalinity was
   250 mg/l CaCO3. In addition, it was observed that the reduction
   increased from series to series (Fig. 3). This is to be expected, since
   the ozone dose also increased from series to series. Thus, for the last
   series of tests, when the ozone dose was 1.0 mg O-3/mg DOG, the
   reduction in UV absorbance varied between 60 and 70\%. Recarbonation
   also affects the production of oxalate and of biodegradable dissolved
   organic carbon (BDOC) as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. Thus, in one series of
   tests, oxalate production and BDOC production increased as a function of
   alkalinity. When the results obtained for a sample whose alkalinity was
   unajusted (25 mg/l CaCO3) are compared with those obtained for a water
   whose alkalinity was modified to 250 mg/l CaCO3, increases of 56 and
   46\% for the oxalate and the BDOC, respectively (third series of tests)
   were observed.
   It is expected that results for these two parameters would parallel one
   another since oxalate is easily biodegradable. Analysis of all the
   results has shown (Fig. 7) that there is a linear relationship between
   oxalate production and BDOC production. Specific UV absorbance (SUVA),
   which was defined by Edzwald and van Benschoten (1990) {[}Edzwald, J. K.
   and van Benschoten, J. E. (1990) Chemical Water and wastewater
   Treatment. Springer-Verlag, Berlin.] as UV absorbance/DOC is correlated
   with BDOC/DOC on figure 6. A similar relationship was observed by
   Gilbert (1987) and Gilbert (1988) {[}Gilbert, E. (1987) Biodegradability
   of ozonation products as a function of COD and DOC elimination by
   example of substituted aromatic substances. Wat. Res. 21, 1273-1278;

Abstract = {{The interactions of Mn-54 radionuclide with humic acids (HA) isolated
   from the sediment of a tropical estuary at Mahakam were studied in
   freshwater system from the Butoniga impoundment by high voltage paper
   electrophoresis. This way, it was possible to detect cationic, anionic
   and immobile Mn-54 species, and to calculate their electrophoretic
   mobilities. In freshwater from the Butoniga impoundment in the pH range
   from 8.1 to 10.5 on average 69\% of Mn-54 is found in the cationic zone,
   which corresponds to the mobility of Mn(H2O)(6)(2+) ions. The immobile
   electrophoretic zone of Mn-54 present in the freshwater at pH>10 in the
   absence of HA probably consists of the sparingly soluble or precipitated
   hydrolytic Mn-54 compounds. These immobile Mn-54 forms are solubilized
   after the addition of HA at elevated pH values. This effect is
   pronounced by the increased concentration of HA and the pH, especially
   at HA concentration of 200 mg l(-1) and pH 11.0. The cationic forms of
   Mn-54-HA present have lower electrophoretic mobilities

Abstract = {{Closed marine systems where there is no significant primary productivity
   and water changes are impractical exhibit increasing;nitrate
   concentrations over time. At The Living Seas artificial seawater
   aquarium, nitrate concentration reached 9700 mu M after 5 yr of
   operation. Concern about potential toxic effects associated with a
   further increase led to the development of a batch denitrification
   system, separate from the Main Tank of the aquarium. The system was
   installed in early 1991 and after 350 days of operation, nitrate
   concentration in the aquarium decreased to 3200 mu M. Two models are
   applied to the empirical nitrate data - one designed specifically for
   nitrate and one originally developed for bromate. Both models have
   correlations greater than 0.95 with the empirical nitrate data over the
   period studied. The models were used to determine the steady state
   nitrate concentration in the aquarium: the first model predicts 850 mu
   M, assuming no idle time between denitrification runs. The second model
   predicts 2300 mu M, with the actual idle times taken into account.
   Potential toxicity and carcinogenicity of bromate has been of concern in
   recirculating seawater aquaria, where bromate is produced from oxidation
   of bromide during ozonation. By late 1990, bromate concentration in The
   Living Seas reached 4.6 mu M. After the installation of the
   denitrification system, bromate concentration has been controlled by the
   balance between ozonation and denitrification processes. We developed a
   model based on the existing kinetic data regarding bromate formation
   during ozonation and an empirically determined rate of bromate loss
   during denitrification. The model predicts a bromate concentration of
   3.6 mu M by early 1994, in reasonable agreement with the observed value
   of 3.4 mu M. The eventual steady state bromate concentration predicted
   by the model is 0.7 mu M. Verification of the model with the observed
   bromate and nitrate data from The Living Seas shows that it is a useful
   tool for predicting concentrations of redox-reactive chemical species in
   a closed seawater system. In addition, empirical data from this study
   suggest that denitrification can be used to control bromate
   concentrations in seawater aquaria that employ ozone for disinfection,

Abstract = {{A biological process employing green sulphur bacteria to remove sulphide
   (S2-) from industrial wastewaters and convert it to elemental sulphur
   was investigated. This research was unique in that dissolved sulphide
   was present in the liquid influent fed into a continuous-flow
   photosynthetic bioreactor. A suspended-growth once-through
   continuous-flow stirred-tank bioreactor was successfully operated under
   five different experimental conditions. For the first three experiments,
   concentrated nutrient solution and sulphide stock solution were pumped
   separately into a 13.7 litre reactor at a hydraulic retention time of 45
   h and S2- loading rates of 2.1, 4.4, and 5.6 mg/h.l. At the lowest
   loading rate, nearly all influent S2- was oxidized to sulphate. The
   middle loading rate resulted in complete conversion of S2- to elemental
   sulphur. Steady stare conditions were not achieved at the highest
   loading rate,and S2- accumulated in the bioreactor. In two more
   experiments, nutrient medium and S2- stock solution were separately fed
   into a 12.0 litre bioreactor at S2- loading rates of 3.2 and 2.7 mg/h.l
   and hydraulic retention times of 173 and 99 h respectively. In these
   trials, the loading rates were adjusted:to maintain a residual of 20 to
   30 mg S2-/h.l in the bioreactor, and consequently, there was nearly
   complete conversion of the consumed S2- to elemental sulphur. A
   parameter was developed to relate the results from these experiments to
   those reported in the literature, where smaller reactors and higher
   bacterial concentrations were used in batch reactors fed with H2S(g).
   This parameter described the capacity of the bioreactor to consume S2-
   and was calculated as the product of the radiant flux per unit reactor
   volume and the bacteriochlorophyll concentration. (C) 1998 Elsevier

   approach is supported by recent findings and ``post-factum{''} analysis
   of available data concerning nonionic and anionic surfactants,
   chlorides, nitrates, tritium, heavy metals and organic hydrocarbons in
   Israel soils and groundwater. Specifically, high concentrations of
   anthropogenic chlorides, organic surfactants, and nitrates (> 400, 0.5
   and 50 ppm respectively) and rates of water vertical infiltration
   (0.24-180 m/day) have been found in the Gaza Strip coastal aquifer. In
   view of the (a) soil heterogeneity, which results in paths of
   preferential flow in the vadose zone; (b) presence of surfactants in the
   aqueous fluid which results in an enhanced groundwater contamination by
   solubilized and/or dispersed water insoluble organic and inorganic

Abstract = {{The chemical source of objectionable odors that are emitted from the
   Lake of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) and the relationship to the lake algae
   were elucidated. The lake serves for recreation and as an operational
   water reservoir, supplying a quarter of the water consumption of Israel.
   Analysis by closed loop stripping apparatus (CLSA), coupled with GC/MSD,
   olfactory GC and other detectors, revealed that the odorous compounds
   belong to the methylsulfide Family, including, dimethylsulfide,
   dimethyldisulfide, dimethyltrisulfide and methyl methanethiosulfonate.
   The odor episodes coincide with a bloom of Peridinium gatunense algae.
   Peridinium gatunense rich samples, taken from the lake during the bloom
   season, emitted the same sulfur compounds. Depth profiles of Peridinium
   algae, sulfur compounds, dissolved oxygen, pH and temperature revealed
   strong correlation between the algal photoinduced motion in the water
   column and the distribution of dimethyldisulfide and dimethyltrisulfide,
   while the concentrations of dimethylsulfide and methyl
   methanethiosulfonate did not follow the same trend. In all cases, the
   dimethyloligosulfides were produced in the oxic region and were
   independent of the anoxic conditions in the hypolimniumon or in the
   sediment. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An artificial flood to determine the hydrological network's contribution
   to phosphorus exports in a small rural watershed}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1801-1810}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most of the phosphorus moved from watersheds to surface waterbodies is
   particulate and its transfer is in-stream processes dependant (Newbold
   et al., 1983). Phosphorus retention in the hydrological network can be
   due to settlement, biological consumption, chemical precipitation
   (Pilleboue and Dorioz, 1986), adsorption (Green et al., 1978) and
   storage in the interstitial water (Garban er al., 1995). This retention
   is proportional to phosphorus concentration and is also dependent on
   hydrology (Dorioz er al., 1989; Svendsen et al., 1995). Inversely, most
   of the phosphorus is emitted during floods when soil erosion,
   resuspension of non consolidated stream bed sediments and stream bed
   erosion occur. The general objective of the work is to study the role of
   the hydrological network on phosphorus transfer in a small rural
   watershed during a minor flood.
   A mass balance between phosphorus input and output in the river (Dorioz
   et al., 1989) is difficult to establish during rainy periods because of
   the great number of phosphorus sources and their diffuse emissions. That
   is why an artificial flood (Casey and Farr, 1982) was experimented,
   using the addition of water at one location in a small river. The chosen
   river is located on a small rural watershed (310 ha) in the east of
   France, near Lake Geneva (Figs 1 and 2). The experimental reach is 300 m
   long and mostly covered with fine, non consolidated sediments (Fig. 3).
   There is no point source pollution entering the stream. The dryness of
   the experimental period allowed an easy increase in the how from 5 to 20
   l/s. The peak flow reached corresponds to summer high flows. Due to a
   high SO,, concentration, the injected water could be traced (Table 1).
   The strength of injected water (a strong jet of drinking water expelled
   out of a pipe over 2 h) made turbidity increase at the input point. In
   the reach (Fig. 3), water was sampled at the extremities (A and D) and
   at two intermediate places (B and C). Suspended sediments were measured
   at the four locations so that zones of resuspension and settlement could
   be detected. Total phosphorus, soluble phosphorus (<0.7 mu m),
   conductivity and anions (Cl, SO4) were measured at the entry and the
   exit of the reach.
   The main results presented in this paper are:
   In spite of the increase of flow during the flood, the reach could be
   considered as a sink for particles and phosphorus (Table 2) entering at
   point A, even if the third part of the reach (from C to D) acted as a
   source (Fig 5). The different shapes of the stream bed are responsible
   for such an opposing pattern. The hydrochemical measurements at the
   outlet (point D) show that during the first 120 min following the
   artificial injection, the water quality has not changed although the
   flow has increased. Only after that delay, the increase in SO4
   concentration indicates the arrival of the injected water. The injected
   water left the reach 300 min after the artificial injection was stopped.
   According to Verhoff(1979), this way of water renewal is due to the
   kinematic wave induced by the increase of discharge. This succession of
   water led to the existence of two peaks of suspended matter (Fig. 6).
   The first was due to the increase of flow resulting in resuspension in
   the third part of the reach. The second, smaller, is associated with the
   injected water. Phosphorus emission follows the same pattern (Fig. 6).
   An early and short peak of phosphorus (mainly particulate) is followed,
   an hour later, by a second increase, of mostly soluble phosphorus. A
   detailed mass balance of phosphorus, comprising settlement, resuspension
   and direct transfer is summarized in Table 3. It shows that most of the
   phosphorus exiting the experimental reach (70\% for particulate
   phosphorus) comes from resuspension. However, the levels of phosphorus
   released during the experimental flood were low compared to what could
   be expected in polluted streams, or streams containing an important
   biological component.
   A mass balance of soluble phosphorus between A and D revealed that half
   of its mass was retained in the stream. During low flow periods, such a
   retention is not very significant. This retention during a small flood
   may be explained by a sorption reaction on particles.
   The same patterns described during the artificial Rood occurred during a
   real summer high Row. Two peaks of suspended matter and phosphorus (Fig.
   7) were induced by (1) the increase of flow and (2) the arrival of
   runoff water (Fig. 8). The proportion of resuspended matter could be
   estimated (Table 4).
   This study shows that the establishment of a detailed phosphorus mass
   balance in streams requires frequent sampling at the beginning of storm
   Row events. It also shows that the most bioavailable phosphorus form
   (soluble phosphorus) can be stored even during a small storm flow. This
   leads to a net gain towards the surface waterbodies, since P quality is
   modified as long as the storage goes on, and the bioavailability
   decreased. Finally, we show that within-stream disturbance is an
   important contribution of the total phosphorus emitted during small
   floods. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in the concentration of phosphorus and other nutrients
   along a section of the river Wey in southern England are reported.
   Measurements of the water chemistry upstream and downstream of a
   point-discharge together with the analysis of surface bed-sediments
   indicates the accumulation of phosphorus in surface sediments in the
   spring and summer followed by a decrease in the autumn and winter. The
   profiles of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentration along a
   stretch of river are modelled by simulating the net loss of SRP using
   the Elovich equation End a parabolic equation. The model utilizes
   results from measurements of the uptake of phosphorus by bed-sediments
   in a laboratory fluvarium channel. The channel was also used to measure
   the uptake of phosphorus and release from bed-sediments to overlying
   anoxic water. The measured net loss of SRP in the spring survey is much
   greater than expected from the uptake by the bed-sediment alone. The net
   phosphorus uptakes measured in the summer and autumn surveys are much
   less, and in closer agreement with the simulated data. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although heterotrophic bacterial populations are of utmost importance in
   the self-purification and detoxification processes of aquatic
   ecosystems, there are insufficient data available on the composition and
   activities of these microbial communities. Due to these facts water
   bacteriological studies concentrate more on the detailed species level
   analyses of complex bacterial communities. At the same time by
   investigating many biochemical properties of the strains, one can get
   information on their possible activities and interrelations. In order to
   have a more complete understanding of bacteria living in the
   Neusiedlersee (Lake Ferto), a shallow, turbid, mesotrophic lake, 296
   bacterial strains were subjected to morphological and detailed
   physiological-biochemical studies. They were determined at least at
   generic level. The predominant members of the bacterioplankton were
   aerobic respiratory organisms. A great number of the isolated strains
   could tolerate high salt concentrations, grew at high pH values and were
   mostly inactive in their degradation capabilities. A wide variety of
   taxa proved to be present in open waters, the predominant ones, the
   members of the genera Micrococcus, Pseudomonas and the
   Flavobacterium-Cytophaga group were almost in equal proportions. The
   distribution of bacteria widely varied among sampling regions. Compared
   with the Lake Balaton, where cocci dominate in the open water
   microbiota; the continuous presence of Gram-negative rods refers here to
   the continuous relatively high suspended solids content of the water.
   The reed epiphytic bacterial communities seem to be less diverse at
   species level and coryneforms seem to be in dominant position. Open
   water species diversity seems to be depended on the suspended solid
   content, whereas on the contrary in reed biofilms lower suspended solid
   values help to build up higher species diversity. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The adsorptive capacity of granular activated carbon (GAC) for many
   phenolic compounds has been found to increase in the presence of
   molecular oxygen (oxic condition). This enhanced adsorption is due to
   oxidative coupling of the adsorbed molecules and is accompanied by
   significant oxygen consumption and decreased adsorbate recovery by
   solvent extraction. The present study investigated the possible
   catalytic effect of metals and metal oxides on activated carbon surface
   for this reaction. The ash and metal content of seven GACs were compared
   to the enhanced adsorption found under the oxic conditions, oxygen
   consumption during adsorption and adsorbate recovery. No correlation
   between ash or metal content and these parameters was found. Reduction
   of metal content by acid washing did not impact the adsorptive
   properties of the carbon. In addition, a carbonaceous resin impregnated
   with metal oxides of copper, iron and manganese showed no ability to
   promote oxidative coupling of phenolics. The results of this study
   suggest that acid-washable metals and metal oxides that are present on
   the surface of activated carbon are not a key factor in promoting
   oligomerization of adsorbates in the presence of oxygen. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Mean concentrations of coliform bacteria in streambed sediments in a
   subtropical rainforest conservation reserve in Queensland, Australia,
   undisturbed except by tourists walking, camping and swimming, were
   approximately 0.5 x 10(6) cfu/100 mi during the dry season and 1.2 x
   10(6)cfu/100 mi during the wet season, with the difference significant
   at p < 0.001. In general, total coliform concentrations in sediments
   were not significantly correlated with sampling site, rainfall,
   streamflow or visitor numbers on the sampling date. Concentrations in
   sediment were approximately 1000 times higher than in the overlying
   water column (95\% c.i. 750-1500x). Eighteen individual bacterial
   species in the Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrionaceae were identified,
   including species of Klebsiella, Enterobacter,, Escherichia,
   Acinetobacter, Citrobacter, Serratia, Providencia, Morganella,
   Plesiomonas and Aeromonas. Two of these, Plesiomonas shigelloides and
   Aeromonas hydrophila, are pathogenic to humans. P, shigelloides is a
   common cause of severe human diarrhoea in Asia. This is the first time
   it has been identified from natural surface waters in Australia. (C)

Abstract = {{The main objective of the present study is to investigate the
   possibility of wastewater treatment in ponds for fish culture. A series
   of eight ponds (Au Tau pond system) were constructed at Au Tau Fisheries
   Office, Hong Kong Agriculture and Fisheries Department. Polluted river
   water was pretreated in the first four ponds by providing sedimentation
   (S1, S2) and aeration (Al, A2), the effluent from A2 was introduced into
   the remaining four ponds (C1-C4) for fish culture. Fries of six species
   of freshwater fish including silver carp, big head, grass carp, tilapia,
   common carp and black bass were stocked in the ponds (C1-C4) during
   11/93-2/94, and 1/4 of normal fish feed (peanut cake) were used in the
   fish ponds. The pond water physico-chemical and microbiological
   qualities were monitored during the pond operation period (7/93-9/95).
   The results showed that the average removal efficiencies of BOD, NH3-N
   and PO4-P in the ponds (S2-C4) were 73.5\%, 93.4\% and 82.7\%,
   respectively, while more than 99\% of pathogen indicators (total
   coliform, fecal coliform and E, coli were removed. Up to 97\% total
   coliform, 95\% fecal coliform and 95\% E. coli were removed in S2 (the
   2nd sedimentation pond), The water treatment ponds (S2-A2) played an
   important role in removing pollutants (organic matter, nutrients and
   pathogenic bacteria) and algal promotion, while the fish culture ponds
   (C1-C4) also demonstrated the high ability in PO4-P and NO2--N removal.
   The average fecal coliform concentrations in fish ponds C1-C4 (6.35 x
   10(3) no. 100 ml(-1)) were within the range of WHO guideline
   (10(3)-10(4) no. 100 ml(-1)), but a maximum of 2.3 x 10(4) no. 100
   ml(-1) was detected in pond C4 in May, 1995. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

   first order kinetics. Triazine herbicides were more amenable to
   microflora than phenylureas. The half-life time ranged between 6.9 and
   18 days for triazines and between 13.9 and 21.6 days in the case of
   phenylureas. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A 0.39 ha constructed wetland designed with 9 cells, including two
   anaerobic cells that were to stimulate dissimilatory sulfate reduction,
   was evaluated for its effect on water quality of a low-order acid mine
   drainage (AMD) stream in southeastern Ohio, U.S.A. Emphasis was on the
   uptake and fate of selected metals and the accuracy of a simulation
   model that predicted this specific wetland's behavior before it was
   built. pH and acidity showed little improvement through the study period
   despite the anoxic drain. Iron decreased an average of 166 mg/l to 32
   mg/l and aluminum 83 mg/l to 56 mg/l from inflow to outflow. Typha
   latifolia above-water peak biomass averaged 502 g/m(2) and iron
   concentration in the biomass averaged 2.5 mg/g; plant uptake accounted
   for only 0.07\% of the inflow of iron. Iron concentrations in the
   sediments averaged 14.3\% of dry weight in the surface (10 cm) and 7.2\%
   of dry weight in upper 30 cm with no apparent spatial pattern or
   relationship to vegetation. Simulations published prior to construction
   of the wetland predicted iron removal retentions of 50 to 98\% and 6.1 g
   Fe m(-2) day(-1). When actual field data for the same year were entered
   into a simulation model, the simulation generated a 3.60 g Fe m(-2)
   day(-1) iron retention. Both model estimates (pre-wetland simulation and
   simulation with 1993 data) bracket actual iron removal of 4.76 g Fe
   m(-2) day(-1). Aluminum retention rates ranged from 0 to 90\% removal;
   the model had predicted 0 to 60\% removal. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1923-1931}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Phenanthrene, a three ring aromatic hydrocarbon, was used as a model
   substrate to distinguish between binding and sorption to dissolved and
   to mineral-associated humic acid (HA), with an emphasis on its
   implication to bioavailability. Binding was analyzed by a fluorescence
   quenching technique using Aldrich HA and HAs derived from compost, loamy
   and clay loamy soils. Measurements were made both in: buffered water and
   in a mineral medium to be used later in a bioavailability study.
   Sorption of phenanthrene to mineral-associated HA was analyzed in batch
   experiments. Mineral-HA complexes were prepared with goethite, hematite,
   and Ca2+- and Cu2+-montmorillonite. Interaction of HA with clay minerals
   was greater at low pH and was dependent on the mineral type. Sorption of
   phenanthrene to these complexes was substantially higher at lower pH and
   higher when the HA was associated with montmorillonite rather than

Abstract = {{The denitrification of marine effluents was tested using a technology
   involving immobilized denitrifying bacteria on granular material. To
   ensure efficient denitrification, an organic carbon addition was needed.
   The denitrification rate was quantified in the pilot-unit working as a
   batch fermenter. A first order kinetic model according to the nitrate
   nitrogen concentration was found and the rate coefficient is an
   increasing function of the TOC/N(NO3-) ratio, with an optimum ratio of
   Ig g(-1). Smaller values led to a nitrite production which was
   nevertheless oxidized in the treatment line; higher values could lead to
   the appearance of toxic sulphides. Working on stationary hydraulic
   loads, the treatment capacity of the unit was about 2.4 kgN(NO3-) m(-3)
   j(-1). It was necessary to wash the packing once every 3 days. The
   malfunctioning of the unit could be avoided by the oxidation-reduction
   potential control. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1939-1947}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Fluorescent whitening agents (FWAs) are contained in most modern laundry
   detergents and are thus discharged in substantial quantities with
   household wastewater. To determine the mass flows and fate of the
   predominant detergent FWAs, a field study was conducted at a full-scale
   mechanical-biological sewage treatment plant at Zurich-Glatt,
   Switzerland. Samples of wastewater (raw sewage, and primary and
   secondary effluent) and sludge (raw, activated, and
   anaerobically-digested sludge) were collected during a 10-day period.
   The concentration of FWAs in water samples was determined using
   solid-phase extraction with C(18) disks and high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC). The concentration of FWAs in sludge was
   determined by supercritical fluid extraction and HPLC. The removal of
   FWAs from wastewater during sewage treatment varied significantly
   (53-98\%) between different FWAs. Removal was due to adsorption to
   primary and activated sludge and the observed extent of removal was
   consistent with the individual sorption behavior of FWAs. No evidence
   for biodegradation of FWAs was found during the aerobic biological
   treatment of municipal wastewater with activated sludge and during
   anaerobic-mesophilic digestion of sewage sludge. Average annual
   discharge of FWAs to Swiss surface water is approximately 20 t (22\% of
   the consumed FWAs) while FWA disposal to farmland associated with sewage
   sludge is 11 t/y (12\%), estimated based on the extent of removal from
   sewage and on a previously reported survey of FWA concentrations in
   sewage sludge. The discharge of FWAs to surface water leads to a
   projected average FWA concentration in surface waters of 0.5 mu g/l,
   which is well below toxic levels for these compounds. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Looped sewer networks can be formed by adding relief sewers to increase
   the conveyance capacity of an existing dendrical sewer system. It has
   been observed that looping creates oscillation and reversal of Bows in
   sewers under certain conditions which have adverse effects on systems'
   operation. Effective use of hydrodynamic modeling for detailed hydraulic
   evaluation is instrumental for investigating the potentials for such
   incidents and providing proper remedies. Flow variations over time at
   critical junctions and sewers in loops that are obtained from the
   dynamic modeling are reviewed so that relief sewers may be designed to
   prevent them in an iterative process. A case is studied to illustrate
   the occurrence of such incidents in a real sewer system and their
   impacts on the overall operation. In addition, the case study includes
   in-depth discussions of development and application of hydrodynamic
   models. Results of the study suggest that designing relief sewers to
   form loops be avoided in order to eliminate the potential of any such
   incidents. Otherwise, detailed hydraulic analysis for looped networks
   with dynamic flow routing models (such as EXTRAN block in the USEPA
   SWMM) is necessary with a wide range of drainage conditions which extend
   beyond design conditions and parameters that they may encounter during
   their lives of service. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The decomposition of diazinon in aqueous solution by ozonation was
   studied under various solution pH values, gaseous ozone dosages, gaseous

   to be affected by the dissolved diazinon and influenced the oxidation
   mechanism of diazinon by ozonation in aqueous solution. The gas-liquid
   reaction model was well used to describe the transfer and reaction
   behaviors of reacting species in the system. The quasi-global kinetics
   based on a simplified consecutive reaction scheme was developed to
   describe the temporal behavior of diazinon decomposition in aqueous

Abstract = {{Fungal microorganisms are being increasingly studied for the removal of
   heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions. The fungal biomass in powdered
   form is commonly used in metal adsorption studies. The use of powdered
   biomass can pose problems in its application in batch and continuous
   (column) type reactors treating wastewaters because fungal biomass
   becomes soft in contact with water, has low density, is difficult to
   separate from treated wastewater and fixed bed reactors using it can
   easily clog. Immobilization of fungal biomass in a solid polymer matrix
   will facilitate their application in industrial systems treating heavy
   metal bearing wastewater. In this study, A. niger biomass was
   immobilized in a polysulfone matrix. For this purpose an immobilizing
   unit was fabricated to produce an immobilized biomass matrix of
   spherical shape. The beads were found to have a porous structure.
   Majority of the beads had particle sizes in the range of 2.00 to 0.841
   mm. The biomass beads packed in a column were able to remove metal ions
   such as cadmium, copper, lead and nickel. The breakthrough data obtained
   for cadmium, copper, lead and nickel was adequately described by the
   Thomas adsorption model. The amounts of metal adsorbed per unit weight
   of beads for cadmium, copper, lead and nickel were 3.60, 2.89, 10.05,
   and 1.08 mg/g respectively. The adsorbed metal ions were easily eluted
   from the column using 0.05N nitric acid. These beads may be easier to
   use in industrial wastewater treatment systems in comparison with the
   fungal biomass powder. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The formation of radical species during ozonation of phenols in water
   was investigated with ESR spectroscopy. Ozonation of 2,3-, 2,5- and
   2,6-dichlorophenol gave ESR spectra with a triplet of lines whose peaks
   have a height ratio of 1:2:1. The ESR parameters of the triplet were
   similar to those of the corresponding dichloro-p-semiquinone radical.
   Ozonation of 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol gave the same spectra that
   resulted from the ozonation of 2,5- and 2,6-dichlorophenol,
   respectively, indicating the replacement of the chlorine in the
   p-position by a hydroxyl group during ozonation. The amount of the
   radical increased with increasing ozone concentration and was inhibited
   by two hydroxyl radical scavengers, mannitol and uric acid. The Fenton
   system, however, produced no radicals from phenols. These results
   indicate that an active species in addition to the hydroxyl radical
   participates in the formation of the p-semiquinone radical from
   chlorophenols during ozonation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Surfactant micellar solubilization is under investigation as a promising
   method for significantly increasing the efficiency of remediation of
   aquifers contaminated with nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs). In this
   study, the influence of three parameters on the micellar solubilization
   of NAPLs by a mixture of ethoxylated dodecyl alcohol surfactants was
   investigated: Presence of model aquifer materials, extent of equilibrium
   partitioning of surfactant into the nonaqueous phase, and sample mixing
   regime. The micellar solubilization of two NAPLs, hexane, representative
   of nonbranched alkanes, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene, representative of polar
   and aromatic compounds, was studied. Batch experiments indicated that
   surfactant losses to sorption on organic-coated silica were relatively
   small for these experimental systems. Surfactant partitioning into
   hexane was not significant, but there was significant surfactant
   partitioning into the 1,2-DCB phase, resulting in a total surfactant
   dose required to achieve 1,2-DCB micellar solubilization greater than
   that predicted from the surfactant critical micelle concentration.
   Partitioning of surfactant into 1,2-DCB was selective, with the more
   hydrophobic surfactant molecules Favoring the 1,2-DCB phase, resulting
   in an aqueous phase surfactant mixture with different solubilization
   properties than the original. Mixing conditions had a significant effect
   on the extent of solubilization of 1,2-DCB, attributed to the greater
   tendency of 1,2-DCB versus hexane to form emulsions. Results indicate
   that partitioning may be significant for certain nonionic
   surfactant/NAPL systems and should be investigated prior to remedial
   activities. Total surfactant concentration, aqueous to nonaqueous phase
   volume ratio, and surfactant formulation should be chosen to minimize
   losses to nonaqueous phases. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A simple experimental set-up has been proposed to study the influence of
   Cu(II) and Zn(II) on the activated sludge growth kinetics by following
   the rate of change on biomass concentration during batch growth
   experiments. Data on biomass were fitted to a sigmoidal equation
   providing us the main biokinetics parameters (Y-xs, and mu(m)). Inocula
   seeded to the system was obtained from a wastewater treatment plant
   operating at 14 days cell residence time. A synthetic feed solution
   containing 2000 mg/l gelatin (corresponding to 1630 mg/l COD) served as
   source of carbon. Different concentrations of Cu(II) and Zn(II) (1, 5,
   10 and 20 mg/l) were introduced singly in the reactors keeping all
   environmental parameters constant (pH, T-a, basic nutrients). The
   combined effects of Cu(II) and Zn(II) were determined by mixing these
   metallic ions (5/5, 5/10, and 10/5 mg/l of Cu(II)/Zn(II) respectively).
   Experimental data showed that Zn(II) was less toxic than Cu(II), as
   expressed by a slight stimulating effect for 1 mg/l Zn(II). Moreover,
   biokinetic parameters were nor adversely affected by the presence of
   Cu(II) up to a concentration of 5 mg/l. However, a concentration of 10
   mg/l and higher, caused serious upsets in the system. Combined effects
   of copper and zinc on the activated sludge growth kinetics, indicated
   that these two heavy metals acted neither synergistically nor
   antagonistically. The sigmoidal model very well fits the experimental
   data and could be used in a simulation study. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The biological oxidation of thiosulfate was examined using aerobic,
   continuous-flow reactors containing both heterotrophic and autotrophic
   microbial populations. Complete oxidation of thiosulfate at influent
   concentrations up to 600 mg/l as S took place with production of
   equivalent concentrations of sulfate. Removal of influent chemical
   oxygen demand and ammonia as well as nitrification were not adversely
   impacted by the presence of thiosulfate. Observed microbial yields were
   obtained based on experimental data and theoretical yields were
   calculated based on bioenergetics. Batch kinetic experiments were
   performed using mixed liquors from both a thiosulfate-deprived and a
   thiosulfate-amended continuous-flow reactor. The ability of the
   thiosulfate-deprived reactor to oxidize thiosulfate declined with
   increasing reactor operation time. Thiosulfate oxidation followed Monod
   kinetics. The following biokinetic parameter values for the biological
   oxidation of thiosulfate were determined: maximum specific substrate
   utilization rate (k) 19.8 mg thiosulfate-S/mg VSS-d and half-velocity
   coefficient(K-s) 14 mg thiosulfate-S/l. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A generator column technique previously used to study the solubility of
   sparingly soluble compounds, has been employed in this study to prepare
   high throughput aqueous PCB solutions for use in treatability studies.
   In the present study, Aroclor 1242 mixture was used to load the
   generator column. The total PCB concentration and the PCB congener
   distribution pattern in the effluent changed with time, with lower
   chlorinated congeners eluting faster than the higher chlorinated ones.
   Collection of over 300 bed volumes of effluent from two such generator
   columns provided PCB solutions which showed 75-90\% similarity to the
   original Aroclor 1242 congener distribution. In this paper, the observed
   distribution of PCB congeners in the generator column effluent with time
   is presented and discussed. A reasonable prediction of effluent PCB
   concentration from the generator column was possible using Raoult's Law
   for ideal solutions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of leachate from landfills vary according to
   site-specific conditions. Leachates from ``old{''} landfills are often
   rich in ammonia nitrogen due to the hydrolysis and fermentation of the
   nitrogenous fractions of biodegradable substrates, with decreases in
   concentration mainly attributable to leachate washout. At landfills
   where leachate containment, collection and recirculation is practiced to
   accelerate decomposition of readily biodegradable organic constituents,
   leachate ammonia nitrogen concentrations may accumulate to higher levels
   than during conventional single pass leaching, thereby creating an
   ultimate leachate discharge challenge. Landfill leachate treatment
   options include complex and often costly sequences of external
   physical-chemical and biological processes for removal of high-strength
   organics and inorganics, including nitrogen. Therefore, this paper
   focuses on investigations with bioreactor landfill simulations to
   demonstrate the potential for in situ nitrogen removal in dedicated
   nitrification/denitrification zones. Using leachate recirculation,
   associated system modifications provided separate aerobic and anoxic
   zones for ammonia nitrogen transformations to nitrate and nitrogen gas,
   respectively. Results from the three simulated optional stages of
   methanogenesis, nitrification and denitrification indicated that
   nitrogen conversion and removal was dependent on the operational stage.
   Both separate and combined reactor operation with internal leachate
   recycle provided 95\% nitrogen conversion. In contrast, combined reactor
   operation with single pass leaching provided a conversion efficiency per
   cycle ranging between 30-52\% for nitrification end 16-25\% for
   denitrification, thereby indicating the efficacy of using the landfill
   itself for attenuation of leachate ammonia nitrogen concentrations to
   levels acceptable for ultimate discharge. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Bacterial regrowth in drinking water distribution systems is a source of
   concern since it could result in non-compliance with water quality
   regulations, taste and odor problems, and may be associated with an
   increased risk of gastrointestinal illnesses. Bacterial regrowth is
   dependent on several factors, including the amount of substrate
   available for growth, such as biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
   (BDOC), oxidant residuals and the presence of corrosion. To investigate
   the impact of nutrients levels and oxidant residual maintenance, a
   full-scale investigation of two distribution systems was completed. This
   study presents data obtained from two distribution systems (DS) fed by
   different treatment trains: one DS has low BDOC concentrations and no
   free oxidant residual (St. Rose plant, Quebec, Canada), and the other
   has a high BDOC concentration and moderate concentrations of free
   oxidant residual (Pont Viau plant, Quebec, Canada). Monitoring included
   heterotrophic plate counts (HPC), total direct count by epifluorescence
   after acridine orange staining (AODC), direct viable counts (DVC-CTC
   method) and the measurement of bacterial production by H-3-thymidine
   incorporation. Results show that bacterial biomass (AODC and DVC) and
   bacterial production are lower in the DS fed by the treatment plant with
   a low BDOC concentration in the plant effluent. This difference is
   observed in warm water but not in cold water. The results suggest that
   HPCs are not a good indicator of bacterial regrowth in DSs. Finally,
   statistical analysis demonstrated that the treatment type and cumulative
   surface to volume ratio are the significant factors affecting regrowth
   in the distribution systems studied in warm waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Waste industrial Muco, meihi biomass was found to be an effective
   biosorbent for the removal of chromium from industrial tanning
   effluents. Sorption levels of 1.15 and 0.7 mmol/g were observed at pH 4
   and 2 respectively while precipitation effects augmented these values at
   higher pH ranges. Acid elution of biosorbed chromium increased with
   decreasing eluant pH to a maximium value of ca. 30\% at approximately
   zero pH. Successive elution stages with increasingly strong acids
   resulted in a cumulative chromium recovery of in excess of 80\%. Both
   acid and base treatments eluted biosorbed chromium and successive
   acid/base and base/acid treatments resulted in recovery values
   approaching 100\% at low metal loadings. These values decreased to 80 to
   60\% at higher biomass metal loadings. in comparative studies with ion
   exchange resins, the Mucor biomass demonstrated chromium biosorption
   levels that correspond closely to those of commercial strongly acidic
   exchange resin while the pH behaviour mirrored that of the weakly acidic
   resins in solution. The chromium elution characteristics from the Mucor
   biomass were similar to those of both the weakly and strongly acid
   resins. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study has been undertaken to assess the performance of an extruded,
   polymeric, tubular, microfiltration membrane with respect to its ability
   to disinfect and clarify sewage effluents. Membranes of two different
   pore sizes were investigated and the membrane module operated cyclically
   with 10 min on and 0.5 min off.
   Both membranes were seen to be effective st improving the physiochemical
   properties of the sewage effluents, with significant reductions in
   suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and turbidity. The
   smaller pore size membrane, however, was more efficient at removing
   faecal coliform bacteria (FCB) from the effluents with a rejection that
   was comparable with existing membrane systems. It was seen that
   breakthrough of FCB occurs at the beginning of a cycle and that removal
   efficiency quickly rises to a higher and more stable level of removal
   during the cycle. The performance, with reference to FCB rejection,
   against the primary effluent was significantly better than for the
   secondary effluent for the larger pore size membrane. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anaerobic batch digestion reactors were operated at mesophilic (35

   tallow at levels up to 59\% of the volatile solids. Tallow was rapidly
   fermented to long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) and volatile fatty acids

   was fermented to palmitic, stearic and acetic acid. Methanogenesis was

   contents are amenable to stabilization by mesophilic batch digestion.

Abstract = {{Bioavailable phosphorus (P) requires separate analysis because it is
   independent of physical and chemical P fractions present in runoff. Iron
   oxide-impregnated paper strips (P-i-strips) provide a simple technique
   for determining bioavailable P in aqueous samples. In this study, some
   controversial strip preparation procedures were examined and
   subsequently modified, and the efficiency of the technique was compared
   to the conventional physico chemical fractionation approach. P-i-strips
   prepared using Whatman 50 filter paper rapidly drawn through iron
   chloride solution then immersed in ammonium hydroxide solution produced
   the most accurate and precise results. A strong asymptotic relationship
   between P uptake and the duration of shaking, coupled with rapid
   intra-sample transformations between P fractions, indicated that shaking
   for 8 h was sufficient for complete P uptake from natural water samples
   and standard solutions (0-250 mu g P l(-1)). A single P-i-strip was used
   because multiple strips increased analytical error. The contribution to
   P-i-strips from adhering sediment particles was negligible for samples
   with low concentrations of solids but turbid samples (>0.75 mg l(-1)
   suspended solids) were noticeably influenced by P derived from
   particulate material. Fractionation of agricultural runoff demonstrated
   a strong relationship between the dissolved inorganic (MRP and P-i-strip
   fraction, but only 85\% of the total dissolved fraction (TDP) was
   retained by the P-i-strip, suggesting not all soluble P was available
   for biological uptake. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Reductive dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE) io ethylene was
   supported by complex organic matter such as cane molasses and
   ligno-cellulosic materials as a substrate and electron donor under
   methanogenic conditions. The studies were performed with an anaerobic
   dechlorinating, methanogenic microbial consortium at 20-22 degrees C. A
   high molar ratio between methane and ethylene (158 mol/mol) was observed
   during rapid dechlorination of TCE with cane molasses as a substrate.
   Three lignocellulosic materials (corn cobs, hard wood chips and
   newsprint) supported dechlorination of TCE to ethylene. After 140 days
   of incubation, the molar ratio between methane and ethylene was 36, 29
   and 22 mmol/mmol for corn cobs, wood chips and newsprint, respectively.
   The rates of dechlorination and methanogenes were relatively rapid
   during the first 60 days. The efficiency of COD and electrons used for
   dechlorination ranged from 0.3-0.5\% for cane molasses to 2.0-3.5\% for
   ligno-cellulosic materials. Methanogenesis was more prevalent reaction
   than dechlorination during the studies, bur the fraction of electron
   donors and chemical oxygen demand (COD) used for dechlorination was
   increased when biodegradability of the ligno-cellulosic materials
   slowed. The complex organic matter can be used as a cost-effective
   substrate for anaerobic biotreatment of chlorinated ethylenes. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Aquatic scientists and managers have no conventional mechanism with
   which to characterize and compare nutrients and algal biomass in streams
   within a broader context analogous to trophic state categorization in
   lakes by chlorophyll (chl) and nutrients. We analyzed published data for
   a large number of distinct, temperate, stream sites for mean benthic chl
   (n = 286), maximum benthic chl (n = 176), sestonic chl (n = 292), total
   nitrogen (n = 1070); and total phosphorus (n = 1365) as a first effort
   to establish criteria for trophic boundaries. Two classification systems
   are proposed. In the first system, the boundary between oligotrophic and
   mesotrophic categories is defined by the lower third of the cumulative
   distribution of the values. The mesotrophic-eutrophic boundary is
   defined by the upper third of the distribution. In the second system,
   individual streams are placed more precisely in a broad geographic
   context by assessing the proportion of streams that have greater or
   lesser nutrient and chl values. The proposed relationships for streams
   were compared to trophic criteria published for lakes. The proposed
   trophic boundaries for streams generally include a broader range of
   values in the mesotrophic range than conventional criteria for lakes.
   The ratio of maximum to mean benthic chl for streams was significantly
   higher than that found for planktonic chl in lakes, reflecting the
   greater variance in streams. This high variance in streams suggests that
   the proposed stream trophic criteria should be viewed only as a general
   first approach to categorizing stream ecosystems. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective of this laboratory study was to investigate the efficiency
   of hydrolysed sludge and solid organic waste as a carbon source for
   denitrification in a packed bed reactor compared to ethanol and acetic
   acid. An artificial wastewater with a temperature in the range of 9-11
   degrees C was used. The denitrification rate, the COD consumption and
   utilization efficiency and the pressure drop were response parameters.
   Under the experimental conditions, a maximum denitrification rate of
   about 2.5 kg NO3-N/m(3).d was achieved with ethanol, whereas acetic acid
   gave a lower and more variable rate below 2 kg NO3-N/m(3).d. The
   required COD/NO3-N ratio with ethanol was close to 4.5 g COD/g NO3-N. A
   reduced rare was found at effluent concentrations below 15 mg COD/l.
   Hydrolysate from sludge and solid organic waste gave the same maximum
   denitrification rate as ethanol, but a ratio of 8-10 g COD/g NO3-N was
   required. The rate decreased at effluent concentrations below 75 mg
   COD/l. While close to 69\% of the COD in the hydrolysate was removed,
   only 45\% was utilized for denitrification. The removal of phosphorus
   was found to be three times higher than the theoretical consumption
   based on growth. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A comparison was made of the remedial effect on organic contaminants
   using ozone, chlorine dioxide, potassium permanganate and hydrogen
   peroxide in laboratory tests. Chlorine dioxide was chosen for use in in
   situ remediation of a petroleum contaminated aquifer. The laboratory
   experiments indicated that oxidation capacity of chlorine dioxide was
   affected by reaction time, gas injection method, and pH of groundwater.
   A pilot-scale field experiment was conducted through the oxidation
   treatment involving the injection of chlorine dioxide solution into the
   aquifer where pollutants included more than 80 organic compounds
   containing 14 mutagens. The in situ oxidation treatment proved that most
   of the organic contaminants including 5 mutagenic compounds were
   decomposed or removed and 19 new by-products were found without
   mutagenic carcinogens. The results shows that the unsaturated
   hydrocarbons were easily removed excluding that some of saturated alkane
   and alkene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic
   compounds were not oxidizable. The oil concentration in groundwater
   reduced by 50-60\%. It was evident that desorption of organic
   contaminants from aquifer media significantly affected the groundwater
   quality during remediation process. Therefore, groundwater remediation
   must include aquifer media cleaning. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The combined TiO2-assisted photocatalytic reduction of TNT in series
   with fungal mineralization by Phanerochaete chrysosporium was
   investigated. Previously unreported byproducts from the photocatalytic
   reduction of TNT (at pH 3.1 to 6.6 under a nitrogen atmosphere) were
   observed: 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4-diamino-6-nitrotoluene,
   4-hydroxylamino-2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4-dihydroxylamino-6-nitrotoluene,
   and 2-hydroxylamino-4-amino-6-nitrotoluene. The extent of TNT
   mineralization was approximately 14\% by biological transformation alone
   and improved to approximately 32\% using the combined photocatalytic and
   fungal treatment. No significant mineralization was seen during
   photocatalytic reduction of TNT. Six hours of photocatalytic
   pretreatment resulted in the greatest extent of biological
   mineralization in the combined process. In addition, solubility and
   polarity of transformation products was increased in the combined
   treatment over that of fungal or photocatalytic transformation alone.
   HPLC, mass spectrometry and C-14-radiotracer analyses of the TNT
   transformations were conducted to show both qualitative and quantitative
   aspects of the photocatalytic reduction and biological oxidation
   sequences. This experimentation demonstrated that a combined
   photochemical and biological sequence of treatment may be a viable
   method of treating aqueous TNT wastes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF) is a new method for
   characterizing heterotrophic bacteria in aquatic environments. SdFFF
   separates bacteria on the basis of the buoyant mass of the cells, and so
   biomass per cell can be directly determined at each point across the
   fractionation. The only datum required for this calculation is the
   average specific gravity of the cell organic matter. When an estimate of
   the cell number concentration in fractions across the SdFFF separations
   is made then the biomass distribution and total bacterial biomass of the
   sample can be determined directly. The SdFFF method has the potential to
   provide more accurate bacterial biomass data than existing methods which
   require the use of a biomass:biovolume conversion factor. It is also
   less time consuming and tedious than measuring the biovolume by
   microscopy. In this paper the method is tested for the first time to
   make estimates of the bacterial biomass in natural waters. Samples from
   four distinctly different environments were analyzed namely. sea water,
   an urban lake, a billabong (oxbow lake) and a wastewater containing
   sewage. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of sedimentation field-flow
   fractionation (SdFFF) for the physical characterization of bacteria
   cells found in natural aquatic environments. This technique separates
   bacteria on the basis of the buoyant mass of the cells and fractions can
   be collected for determination of cell numbers and volume. This enables
   the cell density and size distribution of the sample to be calculated.
   SdFFF is also capable of generating very detailed cell size and specific
   gravity distributions which may be useful data in assessing the
   bacterial growth status of natural waters. Data for samples from
   seawater, two lakes and a sewer drain are given. The specific gravity of
   cells varies both within and between samples and falls in the range
   1.03-1.2 g cm(-3). This contrasts with previous work which shows little
   variation within a given cultured bacteria sample and indicates that
   natural populations contain a range of different bacteria types. (C)

Abstract = {{Disinfection of water supplies is of paramount importance for the
   prevention of waterborne diseases. Unfortunately, an unwanted side
   effect is the formation of by-products. Currently, chlorine and
   monochloramine are the only agents used to disinfect major drinking
   water supplies in Australia. Historically, some Australian waters have
   produced high concentrations of disinfection by-products (DBPs) upon
   chlorination. However, most water authorities in Australia do not
   routinely monitor DBP concentrations, with only a few analysing for THMs
   alone. Accordingly, there has been very little information available on
   the nature, distribution and typical concentrations of DBPs in
   Australian drinking waters.
   A number of analytical methods for the determination of DBPs were
   assessed and an analytical survey of 16 drinking Raters from around
   Australia was conducted to determine their occurrence. Typically, DBP
   concentrations, with the exception of cyanogen chloride, were lowest in
   chloraminated waters. The survey revealed that for some waters,
   chloroacetic acid and chloral hydrate are the DBPs most likely to exceed
   the 1996 NHMRC Australian Drinking Water Guidelines. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The numerical simulation of the disinfection processes in a contact tank
   involves determining both the flow and solute transport distributions.
   In this study it has been established that the reliability of the solute
   transport predictions depends strongly upon the accuracy of the
   hydrodynamic predictions. In the hydrodynamic computations, it is common
   practice to combine various turbulence models and numerical schemes to
   approximate the shear stress and advection terms, e.g. the depth mean
   eddy viscosity model with either a first-order or third-order upwind
   difference scheme; the k-epsilon model or the Smagorinsky model in Large
   Eddy Simulation (LES) with a first-order upwind scheme, etc. A question
   which this study also sought to answer, is to what extent the accuracy
   of the discretization of the advection terms in the solute transport
   equations affects the discrepancy between the concentration prediction
   and the physical model, or field measured results, whilst the flow is
   simulated using various difference and turbulence models. In this study
   the advection terms in the solute transport equation were evaluated
   using the QUICK and the third-order upwind difference schemes in
   separate simulation runs. The numerical predictions of the dye transport
   within a contact tank for a pulse injection, were compared with
   experimental measurements carried out in a physical model. It has been
   demonstrated that the reliability of some predicted bulk characteristics
   of the flow in a contact tank, such as the depth of flow and the
   cross-sectional averaged velocity, are of crucial importance in the
   computation of solute transport processes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Although cationic metal contaminants can be effectively removed From
   wastewaters by treatment with biopolymers, application of biopolymers
   for the removal of anionic contaminants (such as As, Cr(VI), and Se) has
   been limited. The objective of this study was to examine the fundamental
   aspects of a possible remediation strategy for removal of anionic metal
   species employing the biopolymer alginic acid pretreated with Ca and
   Fe(III). Spherical gel beads (2 mm in diameter) were formed by
   dispensing the biopolymer solution dropwise into 0.1 M CaCl2; Ca beads
   were then washed and equilibrated with 0.1 M FeCl3 to achieve partial
   substitution of Fe(III) for Ca. The resulting Ca-Fe beads were found to
   be effective at removing As(V) from solution on a time scale of
   approximately 100 h. As(V) sorption was pH dependent; optimal removal
   and stability of the Ca-Fe beads was achieved at pH 4. At a given
   initial As(V) concentration, As(V) removal efficiency increased with
   increasing Fe content (number of beads); at an initial As(V)
   concentration of 400 mu g/l, up to 94\% removal was achieved at pH 4
   after 120 h. For a given Fe content, uptake of As(V) increased with
   increasing initial As(V) concentration until saturation was reached.
   Sorption data was modeled using a single type of As(V) binding site.
   Data on As(V) sorption as a function of dissolved As(V) concentration
   and Fe content were used to obtain and validate the site density and
   conditional affinity constant for As(V) sorption. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents biological and physical performance data from a
   pilot-scale membrane bioreactor system fed with synthetic wastewater
   containing high molecular weight compounds. At steady stare, high
   effluent quality was obtained and maintained for about 350 days. The
   membrane was effective in retaining heterotrophic microorganisms and
   MS-2 viruses, eliminating the need for effluent disinfection. The flux
   through the membrane decreased rapidly with increasing total suspended
   solids (TSS) concentrations between 2 and 15 g/L. The flux increased
   linearly with the transmembrane pressure (TMP), before reaching a
   maximum. A linear relationship between the maximum flux and the cross
   flow velocity (CFV) for different TSS concentrations was observed. The
   ability of the bioreacter culture to degrade high molecular weight
   compounds in the wastewater, and the mechanisms involved in this process
   were examined in detail by performing respirometry experiments, Casein
   was used as the model compound and different initial substrate to
   biomass ratios (S-o/X-o) were tested. In experiments with high S-o/X-o,
   several observations were made: (1) the oxidation of casein occurred in
   two distinct steps, (2) the yield coefficient is smaller than 0.15 mg
   VSS/mg COD consumed, and (3) nitrification does not occur. Under low
   S-o/X-o conditions, using C-14-casein, the following observations were
   made: (1) complete hydrolysis of casein occurs very fast (less than 100
   h) and (2) oxygen uptake and nitrogen measurements suggest nitrification
   takes place. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Leachate from a municipal landfill receiving both household and
   industrial waste was treated in pilot scale suspended carrier biofilm
   reactors for removal of nitrogen and organic matter. Nitrification was
   studied in two parallel aerated reactors, filled to 60\% (v/v) with two
   different models of carrier media with specific surface areas of 210 and
   390 m(2)/m(3) media, respectively. Denitrification was carried out in a
   mechanically stirred, anoxic reactor filled to 40\% with the carrier
   media having a surface area of 210 m(2)/m(3). Nitrified leachate from
   one of the aerobic reactors was fed to the anoxic reactor together with
   external carbon source, initially acetic acid and later methanol, to
   promote denitrification. The leachate temperature varied between 10 and
   26 degrees C during the study. Nitrification proceeded well in this
   temperature range. The highest volumetric nitrification rate, 24 g
   N/m(3) reactor h (16 degrees C), was obtained for the media with the
   largest surface area. The maximum denitrification rate with methanol as
   carbon source was approximately 55 g N/m(3) h. As the process had
   reached optimal operation, inorganic nitrogen was almost completely
   removed and the removal of total nitrogen was approximately 90\%. The
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was around 20\% during the study.

Abstract = {{Biosorption of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) in the upflow anaerobic
   sludge blanket (UASB) treatment process was investigated using batch
   tests and continuous reactor runs. Batch experiments were conducted, for
   characterization of the biosorption, with two active and one inactivated
   (autoclaved) sludge granules as sorbents and with a single (oleic acid)
   or a mixture of LCFA (LCFA(m); 50\% oleic, 35\% palmitic and 15\%
   stearic acid) as sorbates. The LCFA(m) showed a faster adsorption onto
   the granules than oleic acid. With the active sludge granules,
   adsorption was followed by desorption. Methane production increased
   significantly, either simultaneously (at lower LCFA concentrations) or
   succeedingly (at higher concentrations) with desorption. The desorption
   was mediated by biological activity, since it did not prevail with
   inactivated granules or with active granules inhibited at higher LCFA(m)
   concentrations. The inactivated granules had a slightly higher initial
   biosorption capacity. Increased LCFA concentrations resulted in more
   LCFA adsorbed and greater inhibition of their biodegradation. A
   hypothesis is proposed to explicate the relationship between
   biosorption, desorption and biodegradation of LCFA by sludge granules:
   adsorption is a prerequisite for biodegradation while desorption is a
   consequence of biodegradation. Isothermal studies with oleate showed
   that the apparent biosorption could be described by the physical
   multilayer adsorption theory and the sorption isotherm derived was
   consistent with the Freundlich model. The quantitative relation between
   LCFA biosorption and granular sludge flotation was investigated in a
   UASB reactor fed with LCFA(m). Sludge flotation depended on the LCFA(m)
   loading rate rather than on their concentration. The higher the loading
   implemented, the more flotation occurred and the shorter rime required
   for complete flotation of the sludge bed. Flotation started when the
   LCFA(m) loading rate exceeded 0.09 g COD/g VSS-d, while complete
   flotation occurred at the loading rates exceeding 0.2 g: COD/g VSS-d.
   These results suggest that sludge bed wash-out is likely to be
   encountered before inhibition of methanogenesis during the treatment of
   LCFA-containing wastewaters by the UASB process. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Packed-bed reactors were used to examine the effects of molecular size
   and charge on biofilm sorption of organic compounds selected for their
   similarity to the size and charge ranges of aquatic natural organic
   matter (NOM). In addition, the sorbate compounds were chosen for
   nonbiodegradability, which was verified by BOD tests. In experiments
   using uncharged NOM-surrogate compounds it was found that as sorbate
   molecular size increased, biofilm sorption decreased. Also, negatively
   charged NOM-surrogate compounds were found to be less well sorbed to
   biofilm than neutral molecules. Apparently biofilm sorption of small
   molecules is enhanced by diffusion of the sorbate into the porous
   biofilm matrix; whereas larger sorbate molecules probably accumulate at
   the biofilm-water interface because they are excluded from the biofilm
   pores. The observed decrease in biofilm sorption of anionic organic
   molecules compared to removal of neutral sorbates was thought to be the
   result of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively-charged sorbate
   and the negatively-charged biofilm particularly slowing diffusion of the
   sorbate molecules within the biofilm. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A pilot-scale trickle-bed air biofilter (TBAB) was evaluated for the
   removal of styrene from a waste gas stream. Six-millimeter (6-mm) Celite
   pellets (R-635) were used as the biological attachment medium. The
   operating parameters considered in the study included the styrene
   volumetric loading, the empty-bed residence time (EBRT), the frequency
   End duration of backwashing, and nutrient-phosphorous (nutrient-P)
   management as a biomass control strategy. The aim of the study was to
   demonstrate that high removal efficiencies could be sustained over a
   long period. Periodic backwashing of the biofilter with full-medium
   fluidization was necessary for removing excess biomass and attaining
   stable, longterm high removal efficiencies. Styrene removal efficiencies
   in the 99\% + level were achieved for volumetric loading rates up to
   2.93 kg COD/m(3).day and a 1-min EBRT. With a COD volumetric loading
   rate of 4.26 kg COD/m(3).day and a 0.67-min EBRT, removal efficiencies
   in the 97-99\% level were achieved. Evaluations of pseudo steady-state
   performance data, 1 day following backwashing, yielded first order
   removal rate constants that were dependent on EBRT. Nutrient-phosphorus
   (nutrient-P) limitations Failed to provide a strategy for biomass
   control while at the same time maintaining acceptable performance. (C)

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to suggest an efficient defluorination
   process which does not require a big investment. For this, the
   electrocoagulation process with aluminium bipolar electrodes was used.
   In the first step, the influence of parameters such as inter-electrode
   distance, fluoride concentration, temperature and the pH of the
   solution, were investigated and optimized with synthetic water in batch
   mode. Ln the second step, the optimization process was continued with
   Oued Souf water (south Algeria) where the influence of the current
   density and the area/volume ratio on the defluorination process was
   evaluated. The electrocoagulation process with aluminium bipolar
   electrodes permitted the defluorination of Sahara water without adding
   soluble salts to the treated water. The aluminium-fluoride weight ratio
   attained 17/1. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of trace concentrations of dissolved phosphate is often
   responsible for causing eutrophication problems in lakes, reservoirs,
   other confined water bodies and coastal waters. In this regard, both
   biological and physico-chemical treatment processes have been studied
   extensively to remove phosphate from contaminated water/wastewater.
   There, however, remains a major need to identify/develop a viable
   fixed-bed process which can essentially eliminate phosphate from
   contaminated water/wastewater. Previous investigators have shown the
   advantages as well as shortcomings of the fixed-bed process when
   strong-base anion exchangers, activated alumina and zirconium oxides are
   used as sorbents. The present study reports the results of a detailed
   investigation pertaining to selective phosphate removal by a new class
   of sorbent, referred to as polymeric ligand exchanger (PLE). Laboratory
   studies show strong evidence that the PLE is very selective toward
   phosphate, chemically stable, and also amenable to efficient
   regeneration. Anion exchange accompanied by Lewis acid-base interaction
   is the underlying reason for PLE's enhanced affinity toward phosphate.
   In several ways, this new ion exchanger (PLE) overcomes the shortcomings
   of previously used inorganic and polymeric sorbents. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of sulfate reduction on the acidogenic phase was investigated
   using anaerobic chemostat systems at 35 degrees C. Sucrose (10,000 mg
   COD/1) was used as the sole organic substrate. Chemostat systems were
   maintained at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 h.
   The sulfate concentration in the substrate was increased to 0 (control),
   600, 1200 and 2400 mg/l. Sulfate reduction occurred even at an HRT of 2
   h, while the hydrogen production rate evidently decreased with
   increasing sulfate concentration at HRTs of 2 and 4 h. Hydrogen was a
   key electron donor for the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). The sulfate
   removal efficiencies were over 90\% at sulfate concentrations of 600 and
   1200 mg/l at HRTs of longer than 8 h. No inhibition in the degradation
   of sucrose was observed although the free-H2S concentration was up to 99
   mg S/1. Hydrogen-consuming and lactate-consuming SRB were maximally
   enumerated at 10(8) and 10(9) MPN/ml at a sulfate concentration of 2400
   mil and an HRT of 2 h. The SRB were enumerated at 10(5) to 10(7) MPN/ml
   even in the absence of sulfate. The results of this study showed that
   SRB could grow under acidogenic condition, and almost sulfate could be
   removed in the acidogenic phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The relationship between sludge carbohydrate (CH) content and phosphate
   (P) removal performance has been studied in three sequencing batch
   reactors exhibiting enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). The P
   removal performance was good when the sludge CH content was low (9-10\%
   CH/MLSS), but it declined concomitantly Is the sludge CH content
   increased. The sludge CH content was found to be a reliable parameter
   representing its capacity for P removal. The anaerobic degradation and
   aerobic synthesis of sludge CH was a dominant metabolic activity of the
   sludge. It was responsible for the change of sludge CH content. Factors
   influencing this activity were analyzed. The study, as a whole, suggests
   that the control of sludge CH content to low levels would be a
   prerequisite for achieving enhanced P removal in the EBPR process. (C)

Abstract = {{Dried urban sewage sludge residues were applied to a sugar maple (Acer
   saccharum Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton)
   forest in Quebec at doses of 0, 200, 400 and 800 kg of available
   nitrogen per hectare (0, 23.1, 46.3 and 92.6 dry weight tonnes ha(-1)),
   applied in spring 1993, and doses of 200 and 400 kg available nitrogen
   per hectare (19.3 and 38.6 dry weight tonnes ha(-1)) applied in autumn
   1993. The lowest dose added the following amounts of metal to the forest
   soil (kg ha(-1)): Al, 243; Fe, 682; Mn, 4.6; Cd, 0.16; Cu, 5.2; Ph, 3.0;
   and Zn, 15. Metal concentrations were measured in soil solution at a 30
   cm depth, during the 1993 and 1994 growing seasons. Concentrations of
   Al, Fe, Mn and Zn reached 8, 0.1, 1, and 0.2 mg l(-1), respectively, for
   plots receiving the lowest level of sludge treatment; these
   concentrations exceeded water quality criteria for the protection of
   aquatic life in the case of Al and Zn. Cd was only detectable for
   treatments of 400 kg available N ha(-1) and greater. where it achieved
   concentrations of 18 mu g l(-1). Cu and Pb concentrations were less than
   the limits of detection. This lysimeter study indicates that there is a
   potential of metal leaching when sewage sludge is applied at doses equal
   to or greater than 200 kg available N ha(-1) to soils with pH < 4.5. (C)

Abstract = {{Both the inorganic nitrogen pool and environmental factors controlling
   the spatial and temporal variability of nitrite concentration were
   monitored in the River Lahn at two sites with different sediment
   composition (coarse gravel/fine gravel and fine sediments). The field
   studies were conducted both in the free flowing and the interstitial
   water. Accumulation of nitrite in the River Lahn occurred in correlation
   to water temperatures over a range of 13 degrees C during the warmer
   season and coincided with high concentrations of ammonium. An annual as
   well as daily variations of the concentrations could be determined with
   the highest data in the summer and lower values at the beginning of the
   colder season. Maxima were measured from May until July 1993, especially
   in the hours around noon, sometimes in ecotoxicologically critical
   concentrations (greater than or equal to 0.3 mg NO(2)(-)Nl(-1)). A
   spatial variability depending on the depth of the interstitial strata
   (8-28 cm) was only found at a muddy study site. Here the concentration
   of nitrite was four to sixfold of that in the free flowing water. At the
   other study-site consisting of coarse gravel, no accumulation of nitrite
   could be detected. In order too assess the importance of abiotic
   factors, e.g. temperature, on the nitrification process, laboratory
   experiments were also conducted. Nitrifying biofilms of a defined
   substrate from the River Lahn were used as a model for patterns and
   processes in the river-bed. The results indicate a critical temperature
   domain (16-22 degrees C) in which the activity of Nitrobacter seems to
   be more inhibited than the nitritation by Nitrosomonas, resulting in a
   transient build-up of nitrite. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Sediment adsorption-desorption batch technique studies of seven
   pesticides and metabolites with different physiochemical properties,
   that have been recently applied in agriculture in Germany were performed
   with sediment samples From the Teufelsweiher pond (area: 3155 m(2),
   depth: 0.3-1.3 m) in Southern Germany. Sorption kinetics exhibited two
   phenomena: an immediate rapid sorption (< 4 h) followed by a slow
   sorption process over a long period of time (two to four days). Sorption
   isotherms could be well described by the Freundlich equation in a
   nonlinear form (1/n < 1) for all seven compounds. The Freundlich
   coefficient (K-f) and Freundlich constant (1/n) appeared to be closely
   related to the physiochemical properties of the compounds. With
   increasing pesticide hydrophobicity (higher K-ow, lower solubility)
   their adsorption was stronger and faster, their desorption much less
   effective and incomplete even after a long equilibration time. This
   hysteresis phenomenon was attributed to both sediment-particle size and
   organic matter content, which also controlled the pesticide distribution
   to the particle-size fractions. This distribution exhibited a bimodal
   behavior: both, the smaller particles (clay, fine silt, < 6.3 mu m) as
   well as the larger particles (fine sand, 63-200 mu m) showed the most
   effective sorption of pesticides. In addition, the pH also exhibited a
   considerable effect on the sorption behavior of the pesticides. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Castaic Lake, a large reservoir in Southern California, experienced a
   two-month episode of the musty-smelling compound 2-methylisoborneol
   (MIB) in the fall of 1993. MIB levels in the water column reached or
   exceeded 150 ng/l. A Pseudanabaena bloom coincided with the off-flavor
   event. Fourteen odorous strains of the cyanobacterium were isolated, and
   eight of them were analyzed by gas-chromatographic methods to verify the
   presence of MIB in culture. The concentrations of MIB in culture ranged
   from 36 to 445 mu g/l: This is the first documented report, to our
   knowledge, of a major MIB episode in United States drinking water that
   was attributable to Pseudanabaena, an organism not generally recognized
   as a taste-and-odor producer. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A series of investigations including plant monitoring, batch
   experiments, laboratory scale continuous flow experiments and final
   field application, were carried out for controlling Microthrix
   parvicella foaming on the surface of aeration basins in an activated
   sludge system. In the monitoring of the plant, a very characteristic
   seasonal pattern was observed in the foaming, and neither metabolic nor
   kinetic selections such as the mean cell residence time (MCRT), sludge
   age and food-to-microorganism (FIM) ratio, were effective in suppressing
   the foaming during the overproliferation of M. parvicella. Three
   investigated chemical agents, namely chlorine, acrylamide-based cationic
   polymer, and quaternary ammonium-based anti-filament polymer (AFP), were
   used in batch experiments and continuous Row experiments for
   physico-chemically reducing M. parvicella, of which AFP was found be
   most effective. Sufficient control of the foaming, as well as control of
   M, parvicella growth was also enabled by AFP in the actual application
   of foaming plant, with no deterioration in the effluent quality. (C)

Abstract = {{Numerical models for bromine and bromate formation were developed by
   linking kinetic models for ozone consumption with bromide oxidation
   reactions. The first numerical model (BasicBr) predicted ozone
   consumption and hydroxyl (HO) radical formation with pseudo first-order
   reaction assuming an HO radical yield of 0.5 mol HO radicals formed per
   mol of ozone consumed. A pseudo first-order rate constant (k(Obs)) for
   this reaction was calculated from batch ozonation experimental data. A
   second numerical model (HSBBR) predicted ozone consumption and HO
   radical formation with a set of theoretical reactions and did not
   require input of a pseudo first-order rate constant. Both oxidant models
   were combined with a set of reactions that account for direct molecular
   ozone and indirect HO radical oxidation mechanisms. The HSBBR and
   BasicBr models simulated bromine and bromate concentrations obtained
   from batch experiments in natural organic matter free (NOM-free) waters
   containing bromide. Analysis with the HSBBR model concluded that the BrO
   radical would be an important intermediate specie in bromate formation.
   The presence of NOM during ozonation was evaluated and it was concluded
   that further understanding of NOM reactions with oxy-bromine species and
   HO radicals was necessary in order to understand and evaluate bromate
   Formation ic natural waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A method is presented to detect the end-point of nitrification and
   denitrification in an intermittent aerated and intermittent fed
   activated sludge plant by means of one single respirometer. The method
   is based on the measurement of the respiration rate of activated sludge
   sampled from the reactor during the aerobic and anoxic phase with use of
   an intermediate aerator between the activated sludge sample point and
   the respiration vessel. The end-point of nitrification is detected as a
   sharp decrease of the respiration rate as soon as the concentration of
   ammonia reaches the ammonia half-saturation value. The end-point of
   denitrification is detected by a rapid and immediate increase in
   respiration rate. Increase of respiration occurred due to accumulation
   of readily biodegradable organic compounds which are nor used anymore
   for denitrication. It is concluded that the proposed method detects both
   end-points of nitrification and denitrification in a reliable and fast
   way. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The azo dye Congo Red, was degraded extensively by the wood rotting
   basidiomycete, Phanerochaete chrysosporium in agitated liquid cultures
   and in solid malt agar cultures. Upon addition of Congo Red to agitated
   liquid cultures, the dye was adsorbed to the mycelia! pellets in both
   ligninolytic and non-ligninolytic cultures followed by extensive
   degradation only in the ligninolytic cultures. This fungus, grown from
   conidiospores, readily degraded ur, to 718 mu M (500 mg/l) Congo Red in
   2.0\% malt agar. Decolorization of Congo Red in malt agar plates was
   suppressed by the addition of supplemental nutrient nitrogen indicating
   that the lignin degrading system of P. chrysosporium, may be important
   in the biodegradation of this dye. This is supported by the observation
   that Congo Red is a substrate for purified lignin peroxidase H8. These
   results are of interest because it had been previously reported that
   Congo Red was not a substrate for lignin peroxidase nor was it
   extensively degraded by this fungus. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Photometers are usually reliable indicators of UV intensities in
   collimated (parallel light source) beams. However, they are not reliable
   for measuring UV intensity profiles in close proximity to a line source.
   This is due to both the geometry of line source emissions and to the
   variable response of photometers within a nonparallel light field.
   Empirical correction factors for the response of a handheld radiometer
   were incorporated into the sum of point source lamp model to obtain a
   rational estimate of the intensity profile in close proximity (1-3 cm)
   to a 15.7 cm long UV source. The correction factors included (1) a
   physical offset because the face of the photosensitive cell is further
   from the lamp than the face of the detector, (2) an angle specific
   sensitivity function, (3) reflection at interfering surfaces, and (4) a
   mathematical simulation for the difference between the recovery of
   spherical versus planar light. A series of light profiles were recorded
   in close proximity to the lamp and compared to the uncorrected sum of
   point source model, and a model simulating the photometer with the
   empirical corrections noted above. The meter model was calibrated at one
   of the points by adjusting the modeled wattage of the lamp. The meter
   model gave a reasonable result compared to the meter reading at all
   other points. In this way, the rational intensity, defined as the
   expected intensity predicted by the sum of point source model without
   correction was found. At the surface of the lamp, the rational intensity
   was found to be 4x as great as the measured or meter model result. (C)

Title = {{Effects of sulfide addition on copper inhibition in methanogenic systems}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{977-988}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Addition of sulfide can play a major role in recovery from heavy metal
   inhibition in anaerobic systems. Whether adding sulfide as a preventive
   means before heavy metal inhibition is more beneficial than adding
   sulfide after exposure to a heavy metal, is an important question. The
   objective of this research was to address this point by studying the
   effects of sulfide addition before and after copper inhibition in
   acetate-fed, methanogenic systems. Anaerobic toxicity assays and batch
   kinetic studies were performed using serum bottles with an anaerobic
   acetate enrichment culture. The results showed that recovery is possible
   with a feed copper to volatile suspended solids ratio (Cu2+/VSS) Of
   0.011-0.022 up to 15 mg l(-1) of added copper. But the system failed
   with 20 mg l(-1) of copper added with a Cu2+/VSS of 0.015. Adding
   sulfide after copper spiking can take as long as 50 days for recovery
   from copper (20 mg l(-1)) inhibition with a high Cu2+/VSS of 0.055.
   Interestingly, with sulfide addition before 20 mg l(-1) of copper
   spiking, the methanogenic systems recovered rather quickly (within 4-7
   days) even though the Cu2+/VSS was in the range of 0.054 - 0.058. Hence,
   the sulfide addition before copper spiking was much more beneficial than
   the same amount of sulfide addition after copper spiking. The best-fit
   inhibition coefficient, K-1 (competitive), for copper alone was
   0.038-0.068 mg l(-1). The K-1 (competitive) for sulfide addition after
   copper spiking was 1.94 mg l(-1). The inhibition with sulfide addition
   before copper spiking followed the uncompetitive inhibition model with
   the best-fit K-1 of 256 mg l(-1). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An investigation into the use of sludge, a by-product of the steel
   industry, as an adsorbent for the removal of heavy metals from liquid
   effluents was carried out. Gases produced in the blast furnace were
   washed and led towards a Dorr thickener where the sludge was obtained as
   a suspension. The sorption of Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Cu2+ and Cr3+ On the
   sludge was investigated by determination of adsorption isotherms. The
   effects of time, equilibrium temperature and concentration of metal
   solution on sludge adsorption efficiency was evaluated. The adsorption
   process was analyzed using the theories of Freundlich and Langmuir and
   the thermodynamic values of Delta G, Delta H and Delta S corresponding
   to each adsorption process were calculated. Blast furnace sludge was
   found to be an effective sorbent for Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu and Cr-ions within
   the range of ion concentrations employed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{1, 3, 5-trinitrotriazacyclohexane (C3H6O6N6) Or RDX is a heterocyclic
   nitramine compound that has been widely used as an explosive since the
   early 1900 s. There is substantial interest in removing this compound
   from groundwater and other environmental media. Advanced oxidation
   processes (AOPs) are currently being tested as a treatment process for
   this compound. In this research five types of oxidation processes (UV,
   UV/H2O2, ozone, ozone/H2O2, and UV/ozone) were used to degrade RDX.
   Samples were collected at various times during these processes and
   tested for residual RDX. Degradation rates of RDX by various AOPs were
   determined and the effect of some process parameters on the degradation
   rates examined. Oxidation of RDX was observed to be enhanced under
   conditions where hydroxyl radical formation could be maximized by
   adjusting the process parameters. Carbon and nitrogen balances were
   performed during RDX oxidation by the ozone/H2O2 process. While no
   mineralization of organic carbon was noted, approximately 50\% of
   organic nitrogen was converted to nitrate during this process. This
   suggests that the carbon and nitrogen in the heterocyclic ring structure
   of RDX were oxidized to organic byproducts, while the nitro groups were
   oxidized to nitrate. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study resulted in the detection and identification of several
   organic by-products that were formed upon photolysis or oxidation of RDX
   by various advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). Photolysis of RDX by UV
   showed evidence of formation of two by-products, probably by the
   successive elimination of two equivalents of nitrous acid. These were
   tentatively identified as I, S-dinitro-l, 3, 5-triazacyclohex-5-ene and
   I-nitro-l, 3, 5-triazacyclohex-3, 5,-ene. Both of these compounds were
   present as intermediates and disappeared upon further photolysis. Three
   other by-products were also detected which persisted for the entire
   duration of the photolysis process. These were identified by
   derivatization with O-pentafluorobenzylhydroxylamine (PFBHA) and
   subsequent extraction and GC/MS. Two of these were positively identified
   as PFBHA derivatives of formamide and urea. Oxidation of RDX by
   processes involving ozone also led to the detection of formamide and
   urea (as PFBHA derivatives) early in the oxidation process. However,
   these compounds disappeared with the progress of the oxidation process.
   Four other by-products which were detected only during degradation of
   RDX by oxidation processes involving ozone. Two were tentatively
   identified as N-hydroxy formamide and nitro formaldehyde, and the
   apparent molecular weights of the others were 88 and 102. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A comparison of tangential or cross Row filtration (TFF) and dead-end
   filtration (DEF) is presented with respect to the separation of
   particulate and dissolved forms of aluminium in natural and potable
   waters (from the Melbourne area, Australia) and synthetic suspensions of
   alumina in waters. It was found that 34 and 87\% of the aluminium
   transmitted through 0.45 mu m filters in DEF mode were not transmitted
   through 0.2 and 0.003 mu m filters, respectively, both being operated in
   TFF mode. Spectroscopic and particle size analysis of suspended matter
   in a typical water sample from the Yarra River indicated the presence of
   quartz and aluminium bearing clay minerals with a modal size of 0.2 mu
   m-below the pore size of filters (0.45 mu m) commonly used to define
   dissolved and particulate forms of many elements. Results indicate that
   TFF produces filtrates whose composition is less dependent on the nature
   and concentration of solids in the sample being processed, and that the
   use of filters of 0.003 mu m pore size effectively prevents particulate
   and colloidal forms passing into filtrates from their samples. Such
   filtrates therefore more accurately reflect the concentration of
   dissolved species of aluminium in natural waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1027-1034}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, an image analysis system for the measurement of the
   average velocity of many simultaneously moving similar objects is
   described. Using a low-cost PC framegrabber, trajectories of the moving
   objects are reconstructed in real time. Average object velocity is
   derived from a statistical analysis of all trajectories generated in
   short time intervals, and a simple geometrical model describing the
   displacement of the objects. This approach avoids the need to recognize
   individual objects in consecutive frames, and so the system can be used
   for the analysis of objects that cannot be tagged individually. Spatial
   distribution of the objects is determined by counting the objects in two
   defined areas of the active window. The calculations are continuously
   repeated, which results in an on-line measurement of the average
   velocity and spatial distribution of the population, and this allows for
   the monitoring of activity in time. Applications include the measurement
   of sublethal toxic effects in static systems or in flow-through on-line
   monitoring devices. The system is illustrated with an analysis of the
   response of the waterflea Daphnia magna to changes in its environment.

Title = {{Influence of temperature on biological phosphorus removal: Process and

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{1035-1048}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the impact of long-term (weeks) temperature changes
   on stoichiometry and kinetics of the anaerobic and aerobic phases of the
   biological phosphorus removal process. Steady state conversion of
   relevant compounds for biological phosphorus removal was studied at 20,
   30, 20, 10 and 5 degrees C, following chronological order. Integrated in
   the process study, two methods (electron-microscopy and dry denaturing
   gradient gel electrophoresis) were applied to investigate the complexity
   of the bacterial community of biological phosphorus removing sludge
   cultivated at different temperatures. The coefficient for metabolic
   conversions obtained from long-term temperature tests was similar to the
   temperature coefficient observed in short-term (hours) tests (theta =
   1.085 versus theta = 1.078, respectively).-Temperature had a moderate
   impact on the aerobic P-uptake process rate (theta = 1.031) during
   long-term tests. However, a strong temperature effect on other metabolic
   processes of the aerobic phase, such as polyhydroxyalkanoate consumption
   (theta = 1.163), oxygen uptake (theta = 1.090) and growth (theta>1.110),
   was observed. Different temperature coefficients were obtained for the
   aerobic phase from long-term and short-term tests, probably due to a
   change in population structure. This change was also visible from
   molecular ecological studies.
   The different temperature coefficient found for P-uptake compared to the
   other metabolic processes of the aerobic phase underlines that, in
   complex processes such as BPR, it is dangerous to draw conclusions from
   easily observable parameters (like phosphate) only. Such consideration
   can easily lead to underestimation of the temperature dependency of
   other metabolic processes of the aerobic phase of BPR. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to test a new application of tracer gas in
   rotating biological contactors (RBC). Our method using propane as tracer
   gas, is able to quantify the purely physical gas liquid exchange. The
   procedure was utilized on RBC in order to measure: (a) the physical
   transfer coefficient with clean discs (Kla) in tap water and in waste
   water (Kla' = alpha Kla), and (b) the biological oxygen transfer in the
   presence of biomass in tap water and waste water (E Kla'). In the latter
   case an enhancement factor ``E{''} had to be defined in order to allow
   for the very large increase in the transfer coefficient due to
   biological activity. The results are compared to those obtained by other
   authors. They confirm the excellent efficiency of rotating biological
   contactors (RBC) as aeration systems and the usefulness of propane as
   tracer gas to quantify the gas transfer in such systems. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Treatment of saline wastewaters by electrochemical method is
   investigated in this paper. Experiments were conducted to examine the
   effects of the operating conditions, such as the pH, initial phenol
   concentration, salinity, current density, temperature and addition of
   small amounts of H2O2 on the COD removal efficiency. Possible optimum
   ranges for these operating variables are experimentally determined. The
   electrochemical method is found to be guile effective for dealing with
   the saline wastewaters with salinity of up to 3.5 w/w\%. Two kinetic
   models were also employed to represent the electrochemical treatment
   process. The experimental data allow determination of the kinetic
   parameters by the least squares curve fitting principle. The correlation
   of these two kinetic models to the experimental data is compared. (C)

Abstract = {{This investigation aimed to establish the contribution of biological
   activity, physical and chemical processes, to the diurnal variation in
   dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide in undisturbed streams. Changes in
   both gases were monitored during four surveys of 24 h duration in 1993
   in two second-order Mediterranean streams: Riera Major, a siliceous
   shaded stream and La Solana, a calcareous open stream. In the latter,
   diurnal changes in carbon dioxide and dissolved oxygen showed similar,
   clear daily pattern when water discharge was low and algal activity
   high, indicating that although reaeration was high, changes In the two
   gases were greatly influenced by stream metabolism. In addition, diurnal
   changes in Ca2+ and DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) also showed a clear
   daily pattern, indicating that the precipitation of calcium carbonate
   was directly or indirectly affected by biotic processes. On the other
   hand, no relation between the two gases was observed in Riera Major,
   where turbulence was higher. In this stream, the concentration of
   dissolved oxygen was greatly affected by reaeration, but changes in
   carbon dioxide showed a clear daily pattern. The lack of agreement
   between the diurnal variation of the two gases observed in this stream
   may be explained by the difference in solubility, which led to marked
   differences in the exchange coefficient rate when turbulence is high.

Abstract = {{2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) is known as a widespread, toxic and poorly
   biodegradable pollutant. In this study, MBT has been ozonated in pure
   water and in spiked tannery wastewater at various PH-values to
   investigate its oxidative destruction. All oxidation tests performed
   similarly concerning the sequence of occurrence of the main
   transformation products. MBT and its breakdown products showed a high
   affinity towards ozone as indicated by the rates for partial oxidation
   and mineralization. Using HPLC-DAD, benzothiazole was identified as the
   first ozonation product, reaching up to 60 mol\% of the original
   MET-concentration, followed by low concentrations of
   2(3H)-benzothiazolone. Only small amounts of additional
   hydroxybenzothiazoles have been found by GC/MS. In all tests, a compound
   with the sum formula of benzothiazol-2-sulfonate (BTSO3) proved to be a
   main transformation product. IR-, NMR-, UV-and MS-spectra were highly
   similar to pure BTSO3. However, benzothiazole-2-sulfite is proposed as
   the correct structure since a slow hydrolysis reaction occurred and
   HPLC-retention times were different by comparison with BTSO3. By further
   ozonation, 7 organic and 3 inorganic anions have been identified using
   capillary electrophoresis with indirect UV detection.
   In conclusion, MBT is readily transformed by ozonation and, thus,
   wastewaters containing high amounts of MBT should easily be detoxified
   using ozone. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Granular biologically activated carbon (GBAC) is in principle suited for
   removal of phenolic substrate from wastewater. In this study a
   wastewater model was used and special attention was paid to the
   operation of separate aerobic bioregeneration of carbon and reuse of
   bioregenerated carbon in a new stage of the experiment. In order to
   assess the effectiveness of bioregeneration, the efficiency of the
   biosorption system both before and after its bioregeneration was
   monitored at the substrate concentrations ranging from 1.9 to 1053 mg
   l(-1). All kinetic parameters for the biosorption system were determined
   for both fresh and already used GBAC. A 92-100\% efficiency of phenol
   removal was achieved irrespective of whether the fresh or bioregenerated
   GBAC was used. The process of bioregeneration for the once-used GBAC was
   faster than for the one that was used several times. It was also faster
   when phenol alone was used as substrate than in the case of a phenol
   mixture.
   Respirometric measurements indicated that a mixture of substituted
   phenols showed inhibition effects on microorganisms. Calculations based
   on these measurements, as well as the findings of GC/MS analysis.
   indicated that deterioration of the adsorbent quality was taking place
   continuously. It was concluded that bioregeneration, carried out as a
   separate operation, could not be recommended for practice. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The Induced Air Flotation (IAF) applies a self aspirating and radially
   discharging funnel-shaped nozzle, which produces extremely fine gas
   bubbles by using only 10\% of the purified waste water recycle as the
   propulsion jet. This nozzle is installed in a flotation cell, where
   intimate contact between flocs and gas bubbles takes place. The
   flotation cell is enclosed by a bigger vessel. In the resulting annular
   channel, the liquid throughput leaving the flotation cell exhibits
   laminar vertical motion from top to bottom which facilitates the
   separation of the residual flocs. This paper presents the process
   characteristics of an improved nozzle design which facilitates an
   optimization of its operating conditions. Using this technique for
   complete removal of biomass from purified waste water, the flotation
   kinetics have been measured and evaluated applying dimensional analysis.
   The results prove the suitability of this flotation technique and allow
   a reliable scale-up for an industrial flotation unit. In comparison to
   the Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF), the Induced Air Flotation needs only
   10\% of the total liquid throughput for gas bubble generation and a
   pressurized vessel and gas compressor are not required. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Lime-treated sewage sludge was produced using a bench process to study
   the leachability and fractionation of Cu, which has a great affinity for
   organics in sewage sludges. The amount of Cu fractionated to the
   organically-bound form in sewage sludge was 73.7\% by weight, while the
   lime treatment resulted in a decrease to 55.6\%. The addition of lime to
   lime-treated sludge mainly led to an increased shift in Cu from the
   organically-bound fraction to exchangeable and acid-soluble fractions,
   indicating that the lime treatment caused Cu in sewage sludge to become
   unstable. The instability resulted from the affinity of Cu for organics,
   which irreversibly dissolve with Cu at very high pH during processing
   and natural drying of sludge. Semi-dynamic extraction revealed that the
   lime treatment also increased percent cumulative leaching of Cu from
   sewage sludge after the extraction period of 12 days. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Title = {{Adsorption isotherm comparison and modelling in liquid phase onto
   activated carbon}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1109-1118}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Activated carbon is used in many processes for the treatment of aqueous
   solutions or the cleaning of industrial waste water. If we want to know
   the dimension of a reactor, using an adsorbant material, it is necessary
   to provide the capacity and rate of adsorption. The study of the
   adsorption equilibrium allows the estimation of the material capacity to
   adsorb various molecules. The representation of adsorption isotherm onto
   activated carbon can be based on models with two, three or even more
   parameters. Nevertheless, when solute concentrations vary over many
   orders of magnitude (e.g. 10(-4) to 20 mmol.l(-1)) (Snoeyink et at,
   1969; Jossens et nl., 1978), the equations with two parameters cannot
   match the experimental results. Meanwhile, the equations with three
   parameters (Redlich and Peterson, 1959; Jossens er nl., 1978) match the
   experimental results better (Radke and Prausnitz, 1972; Mathews and Su,
   1983).
   The aim of this work is to compare the different adsorption isotherms in
   solution For aromatic compounds (nitrobenzene, benzaldehyde,
   nitro-4-phenol, 4-cresol, phenol and aniline) onto activated carbon
   Picactif NC60. Four representations of models with 2 or 3 parameters are
   discussed. The models with two parameters (Langmuir, 1915; Freundlich
   and Heller, 1939) fit experimental data over a narrow solute
   concentration range (Figs 3 and 4). For the Langmuir equation, the
   linear method has an effect on the estimation of isotherm parameters and
   simulation precision (Tables 1 and 2).
   The values of q(m) obtained by linear method (I) are always lower than
   the values obtained by linear method (ir). On the other hand, the values
   of parameter b obtained by linear method (I) are higher than the values
   obtained by linear method (II). The method (I) leads to a higher
   absolute, standard deviation and a lower relative standard deviation,
   than those obtained by linear method (II). Therefore, linear methods (I)
   and (II) are unsuitable because neither of them takes the measurement
   range into account.
   For a wide concentration range, models with three parameters
   (Redlich-Peterson and Jossens-Myers) correlate better to experimental
   results (Figs 5 and 6). Since if is based on the values of standard
   deviation (Table 2) for the studied molecules, the equation of
   Jossen-Myers is slightly better than the Redlich-Peterson one. According
   to these isotherm equations and calculated results (Table 3), we can
   give an average order of adsorbability for the studied compounds:
   (nitrobenzene > benzaldehyde > nitro-4-phenol > 4-cresol > phenol >
   aniline).}},

Abstract = {{This study forms part of the physical and chemical study of the runoff
   water From a motorway catchment area in the Herault region. The
   distribution of particle sizes and the physical, chemical and mineral
   characteristics of the sediment contained in the runoff water were
   analysed for rainfall between February 1993 and March 1994. On average,
   90\% of the solid matter by weight was in the form of particles smaller
   than 100 mu m. The main organic and metallic constituents of motorway
   traffic pollution were contained in this sediment. The analysis of the
   sediment carried by the runoff showed that it contained mineral and
   organic matter. The contents of this matter were further analysed using
   X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry and specific mass measurement.
   Particles smaller than 50 mu m were composed of clays (56\%), quartz
   (15\%), chalk (12\%), organic matter (9\%), feldspars (5\%) and dolomite
   (2\%). The specific mass of the particles decreased with the size of the
   particles and, simultaneously, the percentage of organic matter
   increased. Excessive lead and zinc contamination was found in both the
   organic matter and the clay, which formed the largest fraction of
   particles smaller than 50 mu m. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{In a sample of 102 lakes in the Pyrenees, 68\% were sensitive to
   acidification in varying degrees. A model which describes the regional
   alkalinity distribution by using random variables to represent lake
   alkalinity, chemical weathering and biological alkalinity generation, is
   proposed to calculate the alkalinity loss due to acid deposition, and
   the critical and target acid loads. This model is kept simple to reduce
   the input requirements and make the calibration procedures feasible on a
   regional scale. The relative simplicity of high mountain catchments
   lying above the tree line, in particular the lack of well developed
   soils, makes such a model appropriate for these environments. The loss
   in alkalinity since the start of large scale industrial emissions was
   estimated to be 35 mu eq l(-1) on average. Assuming a scenario of
   increasing nitrogen deposition, we estimate that a critical level of
   10\% of lakes with alkalinities below 20 mu eq l(-1) would be reached
   for a nitrogen deposition of 70-75 mu eq l(-1). According to the model,
   a 50\% reduction of both nitrogen and sulphur deposition would be
   necessary to ensure that all lakes are above the critical level. (C)

Abstract = {{Periphyton diversity and biomass were studied for wet and dry seasons
   (between 1994 and 1995), selected stations at the upper New Calabar
   river. The periphyton species assemblage were dominated by diatoms
   species (45 species) except for areas with crude oil tainting on the
   substrates. The periphyton standing crop and biomass were higher in
   concentrations for the crude oil impacted environment (Stations 4 and
   5). Also the values for the upper limits area (stations 1, 2 and 3) of
   the river were lower than that obtained for the lower limit area
   (station 7, 8, 9 and 10). In comparison using student t-test, there were
   no significant differences in values between seasons for the periphyton
   standing crop and biomass (P > 0.05).
   The assemblage structure for all the stations, showed that diatoms
   dominated the population and constituted over 70\% of the entire
   periphyton community except for stations 4 and 5 where the Cyanophyta
   (blue greens) predominated the periphyton population. The species
   diversity for the stations were above 2.50 except for Stations 4 and 5
   (impacted by crude oil), that had diversity values <2.0.
   Some of the physicochemical parameters such as pH and the nutrient
   parameters (NH4+ -N, NO3 -N, and PO4+3) showed strong co-linearity with
   periphyton standing crop and biomass.
   It is concluded that the activities of industries in the upper New
   Calabar river had impacted on the periphyton community, but such impact
   was localised and not on the entire stretch of the study area. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A method has been developed to measure pathogen inactivation in
   groundwater in situ by installing diffusion chambers in wells. This
   method has advantages over others in terms of utility, reduction of
   artefacts, and the ability to accommodate porous media. The diffusion
   chambers have been tasted in the laboratory for their ease of
   sterilization, and the effect of pressure on leakage. Exchange processes
   across the membranes were examined, and the effective diffusion
   coefficients for movement of KCI through two different pore-size
   membranes are given. An expression to account for the dilution in
   microbial concentrations due to periodic subsampling from the chamber
   has been determined. Finally, an example in a held application of the
   use of diffusion chambers in situ provided inactivation rates for
   Enterococcus faecalis from chambers with and without a porous medium.

Abstract = {{A computer controlled cage-culture turbidostat (CCT) is described as an
   alternative to batch algal bioassays. The CCT is designed to monitor
   algal growth changes in response to the addition of toxicants including
   chronic toxic effects in comparison to batch culture toxicity tests
   which are most successful in assessing acute responses. The system is
   easily and quickly set up, with minimum operator time required once
   assembled. The alga Phaeodactylum tricornutum (CCAP 1052/6) was used as
   the test species. Stable growth of the alga could be maintained in the
   CCT for 14 days, sufficient time to run bioassay experiments using both
   the herbicide Diuron(TM) (DCMU) and a complex industrial effluent.
   Additions of various concentrations of both toxins to the chamber caused
   changes in the growth rate and the chi-a concentration of the culture.
   The Median Inhibitory Concentration of effluent calculated to cause a
   50\% reduction in the growth rate (IC50) in the CCT was estimated to be
   0.33 mu M DCMU, and 15.33\% of the effluent. Comparable results were
   obtained when using the standard algal growth inhibition toxicity (AGIT)
   test, the 72 h-IC50 values were 0.09 mu M DCMU and 16.4\% effluent. This
   study indicates a potential use for the CCT for water quality
   monitoring, which may provide more environmentally relevant information
   than the commonly used AGIT test. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The use of an upflow staged sludge bed (USSB) reactor for the
   optimization of acetate removal during treatment of sulfate rich
   wastewaters was investigated. The USSB treated a VFA mixture
   (acetate:propionate:butyrate ratio 1:2:2 on COD basis; pH 8) under
   mesophilic (30 degrees C) and sulfidogenic (COD:SO42- ratio 0.5)
   conditions. Its performance was compared to that of an upflow anaerobic
   sludge bed (UASB) reactor operating at the same operational conditions.
   The hydrodynamic conditions were clearly different in both reactor
   types. The USSB reactor (number of ideal mixed reactors N-th = 10) had a
   more plug-flow pattern than the UASB reactor (N-th = 3). Both reactors
   reached a specific sludge loading rate of 1.20 gCOD gVSS(-1) d(-1),
   corresponding to a volumetric loading rate of 20 and 30 gCOD l(-1) d(-1)
   for the UASB and USSB reactor, respectively. At these loading rates, a
   maximum COD removal of 80\% was obtained by both reactors and the
   average \%COD used by sulfate reducing bacteria was 74(+/-7)\% and
   80(+/-9)\% for the UASB and USSB reactor, respectively. The UASB and
   USSB reactor reached a sulfate loading rate of 40 and 60 g SO42- l(-1)
   d(-1) respectively, with an average sulfate removal of 45(+/-19)\% and
   35(+/-24)\%, respectively. The USSB reactor showed more oscillations in
   its performance than the UASB reactors already at lower loading rates.
   Staging of sulfidogenic treatment in the USSB reactor resulted in
   development of sludges with different maximum specific microbial
   activities, but with similar physico-chemical sludge characteristics.
   Activity of the USSB sludge on a VFA mixture or with acetate as the sole
   substrate increased from the bottom to the top compartments. Sludge in
   the top compartments adapted only slowly to acetate, as indicated by the
   minor increase (13.5\% in 138 days) of the activity on acetate and
   sulfate in those compartments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Timavo Rivers rising in Monte Nevoso (Slovenia), sinks into a
   limestone fissure and proceeds subterraneously toward the Adriatic Sea,
   feeding many springs and ponds in the Karst region near Trieste (Italy).
   In order to characterize and discriminate the freshwaters of this
   complex hydrological system, 84 samples were taken in 14 selected sites
   during the autumnal flood. Six chemical-physical parameters were
   determined: temperature, pH and conductivity in situ; chloride, nitrate
   and sulphate contents in the laboratory, by high-performance
   ion-exchange chromatography (HPIEC). Univariate analysis of dispersion
   and centrality estimates of the populations of the experimental data
   allow us to discriminate a group of typically-karstic springs situated
   near S.Giovanni di Duino, as well as a group-to the north-of ``mixed
   waters{''} that receive run-off from the northern Isonzo and Vipacco
   river-beds, and also seem affected by seasonal conditions. The
   multivariate cluster analysis (CA) confirms the discriminating ability
   of the considered parameters, and allow us to observe occasional
   intrusions of waters belonging to a group within a different group. The
   principal component analysis (PCA) supports the results of CA and
   permits us to assert the existence of a common watershed for the
   examined karstic freshwaters, which are characterized by 2 PC's: the
   ionic solutes are associated with the first component, whereas
   temperature and pH are associated with the second one. Factor scores
   show seasonal and meteorological effects on the chemical composition of
   the freshwaters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations concerning the polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) levels
   conducted From 1984 to 1992. showed persistent pollution in the surface
   sediment of the Seine river (from 50 to 26000 mu g/kg of dry weight). A
   significant correlation between the particulate organic carbon (POC) and
   the PCB levels in the surface sediment was found (P less than or equal
   to 0.05). In sediment from different depths (3, 10 and 25 cm), our
   results led to the same conclusion: PCB levels increased according to
   the depth and were related to the rise of POC levels. Sediment PCB
   patterns at Maisons Laffitte, Acheres and Porcheville showed no
   microbial biodegradation in the sediment of the Seine river even in the
   deepest sediment under methanogenic conditions. The distribution of
   different PCB components in the sediment appeared to depend mainly on
   their physical and chemical properties. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The activity of electron transport systems (ETS) assayed with 2-para
   (iodo-phenyl)-3(nitrophenyl)-5(phenyl) tetrazolium chloride (INT) has
   been considered to be a specific indicator of the respiration of aerobic
   microorganisms and an appropriate way to monitor such populations in
   activated sludges. We have attempted to define the conditions for
   measuring ETS activity, as well as its relevance in monitoring these
   systems. We measured INT response and quantified microorganism
   populations in activated sludges under extreme conditions, such as
   oxygen starvation and deflocculation. We also measured the INT response
   in each of the following microbial populations: aerobic bacteria,
   anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria, protozoans, and metazoans, as well as
   in fragments of disrupted bacteria. The results reveal that strictly
   anaerobic bacteria in activated sludge also have a positive response to
   the INT rest, which increases when flocs are dissociated or bacteria are
   disrupted. The INT reagent seems to have limited access to electron
   transport chains. The INT test in activated sludges thus does not appear
   to be suitable for monitoring the metabolism of aerobic heterotrophic
   bacteria, their principal population. The INT test therefore seems to be
   inappropriate for detecting a shift towards anaerobiosis. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Poliovirus-1 adsorption to Na-montmorillonite was studied in a complex,
   although known aqueous environment. Influences of salt concentration and
   valence, as well as virus load, clay concentration, and organic matter
   concentration were determined by the viral adsorption and/or loss. Use
   of experimentally designed experiments according to Doehlert's matrices
   allowed for the detection and quantitation of the main effects on the
   viral response, as well as interaction effects between tested
   parameters. Thus, during the reassessment of the higher efficiency of
   multivalent cations on virus adsorption than monovalent ones, and that
   10 mg/l of clay material did not provide a protective effect towards
   inactivation by tannic acid, we were able, first, to observe an apparent
   correlation between viral inactivation and ionic strength, which we
   explain by a potentiating action of salts, and second, to detect a
   tannic acid/aluminium specific interaction that seemed to be responsible
   for the unavailability of these elements for their respective
   interaction with viruses, Tannic acid thus appeared to be a realistic
   model for organic matter, pointing out its possible involvement in both
   virus adsorption and virus inactivation phenomena. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to evaluate the bioremediation of
   C-14-phenanthrene contaminated sediments under simulated in-place slurry
   reactor conditions. This included experiments investigating the rate of
   oxygen demand exerted by the sediments, the rate and extent of
   phenanthrene release under slurry conditions, and the Fare of
   phenanthrene in an aerated slurry bioreactor. Experiments were conducted
   with estuarine sediments collected from Dickinson Bayou (near Houston,
   Texas, U.S.A.). Procedures were employed to minimize exposure of
   sediments to oxygen during handling and aging with C-14-phenanthrene.
   The sediment oxygen demand (SOD) was determined to be 250 mg/kg
   O-2-principally due to the presence of acid volatile sulfides. Under
   slurry conditions, rapid partitioning of phenanthrene was observed. In
   mixed bioreactors operated for 7 days, complete phenanthrene
   disappearance was observed. although volatilization losses were
   significant. Results of these studies provide useful information into
   the operation of slurry reactor systems and potential methods of
   enhancing system performance. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1255-1263}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The feasibility of anaerobic treatment of wastewaters with a high
   calcium content (600-1200 mgCa(2+).l(-1)) was studied. The influence of
   the amount of precipitation and the influence of differences in biomass
   yield were investigated on the development of anaerobic sludge. The
   experiments were performed in lab scale Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket
   (UASB) reactors, inoculated with crushed granular sludge: Four reactors
   were operated during 180 days at a constant organic loading rate of
   14gCOD.l(-1).d(-1), treating completely and partly acidified wastewater
   with different calcium concentrations in the influent. Treatment of
   completely acidified wastewater with a calcium concentration of 1200
   mgCa(2+).l(-1) resulted in an unstable COD removal efficiency (60-90\%).
   Furthermore, cementation of the sludge bed occurred after 180 days of
   operation, leading to operational problems. With completely acidified
   wastewater and a lower calcium concentration in the influent (600
   mgCa(2+).l(-1)), less calcium precipitated and COD removal efficiency
   always exceeded 98\%. The cultivated sludge had a high ash content,
   80-90\%, and methanogenic activity remained more or less constant at 0.7
   gCOD.gVSS(-1).d(-1). However, scaling of reactor compartments occurred
   under the latter condition. The presence of a fraction of non-acidified
   substrate, i.e. glucose, decreased the risk of cementation, resulted in
   better granulation of the methanogenic sludge and seemed to prevent
   scaling of reactor compartments. Considerable amounts of phosphate were
   shown to be removed from the influent, most probably by coprecipitation,
   and incorporated in the anaerobic sludge. The results indicate that
   anaerobic treatment of high calcium wastewaters in UASB reactors is more
   feasible for partly than for completely acidified substrates. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The reliability of a design procedure for packed strippers of volatile
   organic contaminants (VOC) removal from water is tested. The required
   mass transfer coefficients for VOC are recalculated from oxygen mass
   transfer coefficients which are available in literature for various
   types of packings. The data for polypropylene Pall rings and Super Torus
   saddles are summarized in this paper for hydrophilized and
   nonhydrophilized versions of the packings. The reliability is tested by
   comparison of removal efficiency calculated by the procedure with that
   observed experimentally for stripping tetra-chloroethylene,
   trichloroethylene, trichloromethane, chlorobenzene, bromobenzene and
   benzene from water in pilot plant column packed with hydrophilized or
   nonhydrophilized PP Pall rings 25 mm. Differences between experimental
   and calculated values did not exceed 10\%. Differences between
   experimental and calculated values reported in previous literature are
   discussed and possible reason for this discrepancy is given. Due to
   better wettability of hydrophilized packing, the mass transfer
   coefficients for this type of packing were higher by 65\% compared with
   the nonhydrophilized ones. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The behavior of three phosphonates in seven Swiss wastewater treatment
   plants was investigated. The phosphonates ATMP
   (aminotrismethylene-phosphonic acid) and EDTMP
   (ethylenediamine-tetramethylenephosphonic acid) were found in the
   influents of wastewater treatment plants at concentrations between <0.05
   mu mol l(-1) (detection limit) and 0.8 mu mol l(-1), DTPMP
   (diethylenetriamine-pentamethylenephosphonic acid) from <0.05 to 2 mu
   mol l(-1). The highest concentration was found in the influent of a
   wastewater treatment plant with significant input from the textile
   industry. The effluent of this wastewater treatment plant contained an
   average DTPMP concentration of 0.12 mu mol l(-1), which reflects a 85\%
   decrease from the influent concentration. The phosphonate concentrations
   in all other effluents were below detectable levels. As phosphonates are
   not biodegradable, the elimination must be due to sorption processes.
   The phosphonates are almost quantitatively transferred to the anaerobic
   digester. The investigation of the anaerobic degradation showed no
   evidence for mineralization. Compared to EDTA
   (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) which is not eliminated during
   wastewater treatment, phosphonates have less impact on the metal
   speciation in natural waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Rate studies of orthophosphate removal from wastewater in Schoenoplectus
   validus Vahl. (A Love and D Love) planted bucket-sized vertical upflow
   wetlands occurs simultaneously through three removal processes. In order
   of decreasing rate, these are reversible sorption to the gravel
   substratum, reversible conversion to complex phosphorus compounds, and
   irreversible uptake by plant roots. Mixing the rhizosphere liquid, using
   forced convection, accelerated orthophosphate removal; concentrations
   falling From approximate to 10 mg litre(-1) to < 0.2 mg litre(-1) in <
   48 h. The rate determining step in systems without rhizosphere liquid
   mixing appears to be diffusive transport of phosphate. Over two years,
   initial removal rates, and minimum reactive phosphorus concentrations
   changed little, but aged or high BOD systems sometimes released reactive
   phosphorus or tannins holding large amounts of phosphorus. The relevance
   of these mechanisms to total wetland assimilative capacity, and effluent
   quality, are evaluated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{For estimates by plate counts of cell numbers of aggregated bacteria
   growing in a rotating drum bioreactor (RBR) used to examine biological
   nitrate elimination (denitrification) it was necessary to develop or to
   improve treatment methods for the disaggregation of bacterial flocs and
   biofilm into individual cells. In order to propagate and identify single
   strains (1) conventional mechanical methods and (2) a combination of
   enzymatic and mechanical methods were tested. Ultrasonic treatment of
   bacterial flocs at 50 W for 120 sec yielded the highest number of
   colony-forming units (CFU) as determined by plate counts. Cellulase
   pre-treatment of bacterial aggregates or biofilms consisting mainly of
   pseudomonads was used to loosen the extracellular polymeric substances
   (EPS) which are responsible for the stability of these bacterial
   aggregates. Subsequent mechanical treatment led to substantially
   improved disaggregation without significant impairment or disrupture of
   cells. For the detachment of bacterial biofilm growth on the packing
   material, ultrasonication was used for post-treatment, whereas an
   ultra-turrax homogenizer was sufficient for disaggregation of the
   bacterial flocs. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have identified the possible phenomenon of COD
   ``loss{''} in nutrient removal activated sludge systems incorporating
   unaerated zones. One potential cause for the calculated ``loss{''} is in
   the mathematical assumption made with regards to nitrate reduction in
   denitrification. In the COD balance calculation a factor is used to
   convert the amount of nitrate used as a terminal electron acceptor to an
   equivalent amount of oxygen. The theoretical conversion factor of 2.86
   gO(2) per gNO(3)-N denitrified is derived from oxidation/reduction
   half-reactions. Data from twelve 1 L dentrification batch tests in a
   closed reactor system were used to confirm this Factor. A value of 2.96
   was observed but could not be distinguished statistically from the
   theoretical value. Interpretation of the data also revealed that no COD
   was ``lost{''} in these dominant denitrifier experiments with a simple
   soluble substrate. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   antipyretica}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Copper uptake and release rates by Fontinalis antipyretica were
   investigated. A contamination stage in which the plants were exposed to
   Cu concentrations in the range 0.09-0.75 mg l(-1) was followed by a
   decontamination period, exposing the plants to metal-free water. Tanks
   were operated in perfectly mixed conditions and the illumination at
   water surface was 740 lux. Short and long duration experiments (217 and
   1008 h, respectively) were carried out with plants collected in May and
   August, respectively. A simple mass transfer model was fitted to the
   experimental results in order to determine the uptake and release rate
   constants, k(1) and k(2), the Cu concentration at the end of the uptake
   phase, C-mu, and the equilibrium concentrations, C-me and C-mr, for the
   contamination and decontamination stages, respectively. In the short
   duration experiment, k(1) decreased from 846 to 628 h(-1) as Cu
   concentration increased from 0.14 to 0.60 mg l(-1) In the long duration
   one, with plants in different physiological conditions, k(1) decreased
   From 448 to 293 h(-1) as Cu concentration increased from 0.09 to 0.75 mg
   l(-1). The release rate constant, k(2), appears not to depend on the Cu
   concentration and averaged 0.020 and 0.011 h(-1) in the first and second
   experiments, respectively. The ratio k(1)/k(2) represents a
   bioconcentration factor, BCF (Cu concentration in the plant, dry wt/Cu
   concentration in the water). BCF values ranged between 40,000 and
   30,000. A biological elimination factor
   (BEF = 1-(C-mr/C-mu)
   was also calculated. BEF values slightly increased with C-mu, varying
   from 0.58 to 0.62 (5203 < C-mu < 15762 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) and from 0.46
   to 0.66 (3127 < C-mu <23773 mg kg(-1) dry wt.) in the short and long
   duration experiments, respectively. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{With a view to simultaneously conserving the environment and an
   important natural resource, we assessed the feasibility of using red mud
   (RM), a residue from bauxite refining, for wastewater treatment.
   Moistened mixtures of RM and 8\% (w/w) CaSO4 form aggregates which are
   stable in aqueous media. Batch experiments examining adsorption of
   phosphorus (P) by these aggregates for contact times of 3, 6, 24 and 48
   h indicated that adsorption occurred by both fast and slow reactions.
   Likewise, comparison of experimental breakthrough curves (BTCs) for P
   retention on a column of RM aggregates (residence time 3 h) with
   MCMFIT-simulated BTCs indicated that fast and slow adsorption reactions
   were occurring. Actual P retention was predicted, taking into account
   both kinetics of fast and slow adsorption reactions. The RM aggregates
   had maximum adsorption capacities (evaluated from fits (0.90 < R-2 <
   0.99) of the Langmuir isotherm to batch adsorption data for contact time
   48 h) for Cu2+, Zn2+, Ni2+ and Cd2+ of 19.72, 12.59, 10.95 and 10.57 mp
   g(-1), respectively. In continuous adsorption experiments in which
   secondary effluent from an urban sewage treatment plant was percolated
   through RM aggregates packed into columns, purification efficiencies for
   P, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Zn2+ were 100, 100, 68 and 56\% respectively.
   Aggregated RM is suitable for treatment of wastewaters, in particular
   those whose principal contaminants are P or heavy metals. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The changes in the concentrations of infectious coxsackie B3 virus
   (detected by cell culture), and the viral genome (detected by RT
   semi-nested PCR), when the virus is kept at 25 degrees C in sterile
   phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and in PBS plus clay was monitored. The
   viral genome survived for twice as long as the infectious virus. The
   survival of the genome was greatly prolonged by adding 200 mg l(-1)
   Na-montmorillonite to the PBS, while the survival of the infectious
   virus was only slightly increased. The T90 of the viral genome was at
   least 3.5 times longer that the T90 of the infectious virus. Thus, the
   rate of decay of the viral genome is different from that of the
   infectious virus. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A pilot-scale UASB reactor was used to study treatment of municipal
   landfill leachate (COD 1.5-3.2 g l(-1)) at low temperatures (13-23
   degrees C) and in on-site conditions for 226 days. The reactor was
   successfully operated by decreasing the process temperature as leachate
   temperature decreased in winter. Despite changes in leachate quality,
   65-75\% COD and up to 95\% BOD7 removals were achieved at 18-23 degrees
   C with organic loading rates (OLR) of 2-4 kgCOD m(-3) d(-1). At 13-14
   degrees C, 50-55\% COD and 72\% BOD7 removals were obtained with OLRs of
   1.4-2 kgCOD m(-3) d(-1). Methane yield averaged 320 mlCH(4) g(-1)
   CODremoved. Excessive solids washout was not observed despite low
   process temperatures. Inorganic material accumulated in the reactor
   sludge throughout the study. The main precipitants were calcium and iron
   which, at the end of the run, accounted for 24\% and 7\% of total solids
   of the sludge, respectively. The specific methanogenic activity (SMA) of
   the mesophilic (37 degrees C) inoculum used in the study increased 7
   fold at 11 degrees C and 3 fold at 22-24 degrees C during the run. Yet
   SMA at 11 degrees C (0.05 gCH(4)COD g VSS-1 d(-1)) remained one third of

Title = {{Variation in phosphorus flux during a hydrological season: The River
   Adour}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{32}},

Pages = {{547-558}},

Abstract = {{A section of the River Adour (S.W. France) between Pontonx and Dax has
   been studied to determine variations in phosphorus flux, both
   particulate and dissolved, during the course of a hydrological season
   that included two major flood events. The flux has been measured at
   twice monthly intervals, increasing to several measurements per day
   during the flood events. Over the course of the year a total discharge
   of 2.52 x 10(9) m(3) of water was measured at Dax allowing the drainage
   of 1233 t of dissolved phosphorus and 646.2 t of particulate phosphorus
   from a watershed covering 7840 km(2). Two significant flood events
   occurred during the period studied, i.e. in November 1991 and June 1992.
   The measured dissolved phosphorus (DP) concentrations are found to be
   very variable throughout the year with maximum levels being observed
   during the flood events. This maximum release was observed when flow
   rates at Pontonx reached 300 m(3) s(-1), whereas at Dax the peak
   concentrations were observed with a flow of 430 m(3) s(-1). Measured
   concentrations for each flood event were, however, quite different with
   mean values at Pontonx and Dax of 2.62 mg l(-1) and 2.80 mg l(-1),
   respectively, for the November flood, compared with values of 0.64 mg
   l(-1) and 0.6 mg l(-1), respectively, in June 1992. Particulate
   phosphorus (PP) concentrations are limited during summer, but increased
   levels are observed in spring and particularly during the flood events.
   The two flood events account for the transport of 98.6\% of the total
   flux of PP. Finally, it was noted that the variation in DP flux may be
   categorised into phases of mobilisation and retention. The principle
   phase of mobilisation occurs during autumn/winter with retention
   occurring during spring/summer. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The performance of two high rate technologies, anaerobic filter and
   fluidized bed at laboratory-scale, for treating distillery wastewater
   (wine vinasses) at anaerobic thermophilic conditions, have been compared
   in this study. Two kinds of media, corrugated plastic tubes and
   open-pore sintered glass pearls (SIRAN) were used as support on
   reactors. Experimentally, it was confirmed that the maximum organic load
   rate Feed was 32 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) for the fluidized bed reactor with
   the porous packing (SIRAN), 23 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) for the stationary
   packed bed on SIRAN and 20 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) for the anaerobic filter
   on corrugated plastic tubes. Under these conditions, the organic removal
   efficiency was 81.5, 75 and 50\% respectively and the maximum organic
   removal efficiency was 97, 84 and 75\%, respectively. The anaerobic
   fluidized bed technology is more effective than the anaerobic filter
   technology due, fundamentally, to this technology favouring the
   transport of microbial cells from the bulk to the surface and enhancing
   the contact between the microorganism and substrate phases. In this
   sense, the stationary packed bed technology is adequate for the
   treatment of easily biodegradable wastewater or for cases where elevated
   percentages of COD removal are not required, while the fluidized bed
   technology is especially suitable for treatment of hazardous wastes with
   recalcitrant compositions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The method of membrane filtration was evaluated regarding the recovery

   Equal volumes of distilled water were contaminated with a defined

   10(4) parasites l(-1)) and filtered through a special membrane filter
   apparatus. After filtration, the recovered cysts and oocysts were
   identified using phase contrast microscopy and the number of cysts and
   oocysts were counted using a Neubauer haemocytometer. The average
   recovery rate obtained for Giardia cysts was 78.7\% (range
   61.1-105.9\%), and for Cryptosporidium oocysts 42.1\% (range
   30.8-52.2\%). The method had a superior efficiency for Giardia cysts
   comparable to Cryptosporidium oocysts, but there are no significant
   differences in recovery for Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts

Abstract = {{Bioassays have been developed and compared to assess the potential role
   of the estuarine amphipod Gammarus duebeni in sub-lethal ecotoxicology
   studies. The assays involved the monitoring of pleopod beat frequency

   frequency showed a complex response to copper which was concentration
   and time dependent. Swimming endurance however, showed a clear dose
   response relationship and was identified as the more consistent
   technique. Using this assay significant impairment of swimming endurance
   was observed at 45 mg l(-1) copper, 20 mg l(-1) pentachlorophenol (PCP)
   and 8 mg l(-1) benzo{[}a]pyrene (B{[}a]P). These results indicate that

   -1.6 V - +1.6 V. The experimental discharge potentials (Eexp.) have been
   determined by means of current-potential curves obtained by electrolysis
   method between 0-3 V. The percentages of surface active material
   remaining in solution after specified time periods (0-6 h) were
   determined for different initial concentrations of LAS (30, 150; 300
   ppm) by using the potentiostat (+ 1.6 V) and by applying constant
   potentials of 20 V via a direct current source. The concentrations of
   LAS in solution was determined by UV spectrophometer. Results indicate
   that when a potential of 20 V is applied on the electrodes the

Abstract = {{Aerobic batch reactors are often used to estimate the maximum specific
   growth rates of bacteria in wastewater treatment environments. Results
   from these reactors vary, and they are sometimes confusing because they
   do not represent the bacterial populations in the original wastewater
   environment, i.e. in situ. For the first time in batch reactors, we
   present the in situ growth dynamics of these bacterial populations. We
   simultaneously measured bacterial numbers and growth rate, oxygen uptake
   rates (OUR), soluble COD and biomass COD (mg.1(-1)). With a substrate to
   biomass (S-o/X-o) ratio of 1.2, bacterial specific growth rates,
   measured using the thymidine growth assay, increased from 1 to 4.5
   d(-1). During the same period, the initial OUR remained relatively
   constant, with an OUR-based estimate of the maximum specific growth rate
   of 3.6 d(-1). These observations challenge the fundamental theory of the
   batch assay that bacteria are growing at their maximum rate under
   substrate saturating conditions while the yield coefficient remains
   constant. Our results confirm that the batch reactor environment induces
   changes in the bacterial physiology and/or community structure compared
   to the original treatment environment, even at low S-o/X-o ratios. We
   discuss how, simultaneously using both OUR and thymidine assays, gives
   more information about how the cell allocates its energy resources
   between new cell synthesis and cell maintenance. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The humic fraction of dissolved organic matter was isolated from three
   sites of River Vouga (Portugal) and its lagoon, corresponding to
   unpolluted water and water contaminated with pulp mill effluent. Humic
   substances were characterized by elemental analysis, Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, CPMAS-(13)C-NMR spectroscopy and potentiometric
   titration. The fulvic acids isolated from the most contaminated site
   exhibit several structural features characteristic of lignosulphonic
   acids, such as a high sulphur content, the presence of sulphonic groups,
   higher phenol and methoxyl contents, higher aromaticity and lower
   carboxyl content than the fulvic acids upstream of the discharge from
   the pulp mill effluent. The humic substances further downstream still
   show some of those structural characteristics but they are
   preferentially shown in the humic acids than in the fulvic acids. These
   results highlight the importance of the contribution of anthropogenic
   sources of organic matter to the composition of humic substances from
   surface waters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were undertaken to assess the effects of magnetic

   compared with non-magnetised solutions. The results of this study
   support earlier work which indicates that magnetic fields may influence
   the formation of CaCO3 by the suppression of nucleation and acceleration

Abstract = {{Biological monitoring of river water quality in the United Kingdom and
   several other European and Commonwealth countries is based on the
   Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) system. Central to the
   present day application of this system is the prediction of
   ``unpolluted{''} average score per taxon (ASPT) and number of families
   present (NFAM). The paper outlines the need for such predictions and
   proceeds to develop predictors of ASPT and NFAM using neural networks.
   The basic principles of neural networks are outlined and a brief
   introduction to their structure and function is given via a typical
   example. Important preliminary considerations are fully discussed, such
   as model selection, training and testing procedures and the selection of
   relevant input variables. The results of impact analyses, designed to
   optimise the structures of the networks, are reported and discussed.
   In-depth analyses of the performance of the networks on independent test
   data and also relative to the industry's current model, RIVPACS III, are
   presented. The results of investigations into bias and error in the
   predicted values of ASPT and NFAM are discussed and related to some
   possible inadequacies in the database. It is concluded that: predictions
   of ASPT are significantly more reliable than those of NFAM; the neural
   networks performed marginally better than RIVPACS III; ASPT and NFAM can
   be predicted directly, without reference to site type or biological
   community, from a few key environmental variables; and there is scope
   for improved predictions if additional relevant environmental data are
   collected. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Photosensitized transformation of the herbicide 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy
   acetic acid (MCPA) in water}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{The photochemical transformation of the chlorophenoxy herbicide MCPA was
   investigated under a variety of reaction conditions using distilled
   water, Thames river water and solutions of naturally occurring
   photosensitizers. Under low intensity UV (300-450 nm), MCPA was
   transformed in river water with a pseudo first-order k(exp) of 0.029
   h(-1) and a t(1/2) of 23.8 h. In contrast, transformation in distilled
   water was insignificant, with a first-order experimental rate constant
   k(exp) of 0.002 h(-1) and an experimental half-life (t(1/2)) of 309 h.
   Under sunlight (late September to early October, 51 degrees N), MCPA was
   transformed in river water with a pseudo first-order k(exp) of 0.009
   h(-1) and an experimental t(1/2) of 7 days. (However, as experiments
   were conducted in test-tubes, this experimental t(1/2) needs to be
   multiplied by a factor of 2 to provide an estimate of t(1/2) for the
   flat surface of a natural water body.) MCPA was also degraded under low
   intensity UV in the presence of nitrate, nitrite and humates tested
   singly and in combination in distilled water. Thus,MCPA is
   photo-oxidized in the presence of hydroxyl radicals, which are generated
   by nitrate and nitrite following absorption of UV light and also by
   photo-oxidants generated by humates. In tests where combinations of
   sensitizers were varied over environmental concentrations, the pseudo
   first-order k(exp) ranged from 0.03 h(-1) (s.e. 0.0008) to 0.048 h(-1)
   (s.e. 0.0022). The results indicate that although hydroxyl radicals
   produced by nitrate and nitrite appear to enhance rates of
   photo-oxidation, their relative importance is significantly diminished
   in mixtures of sensitizers due to scavenging of hydroxyl radicals by
   humates. Thus, photo-oxidants generated by humates appear to be of
   greater environmental significance than hydroxyl radicals in the
   phototransformation of MCPA. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Toxic cyanobacteria are increasingly found in drinking water reservoirs,
   with cells and/or dissolved toxins entering the potable water supply.
   The most commonly observed group of cyanobacterial toxins is the
   microcystins, and concern about their impact on human health has
   prompted investigations into remedial treatment methods. This study
   investigates the ability of domestic water filters to remove
   cyanobacterial cells and microcystins from drinking water.
   Cyanobacterial cell were removed by the filter, but the percentage
   removal (c. 60\% of filamentous cells compared to only 10\% of single
   cells) appeared to be dependent on the colony morphology. The removal of
   four microcystins was assessed and their percentage removal varied
   little, although microcystins-LR appeared to be removed to a slightly
   lesser extent. Toxin concentration and the presence of cell components
   did not affect the amount of soluble toxin removed from water. The
   performance of three different brands of water filter was compared,
   assessing the reproducibility of cartridges and their efficiency when
   both new and at the manufacturers recommended half-life. All brands of
   water filters investigated were found to remove a proportion of the
   soluble microcystin; however, none removed all the toxin in a single
   passage through the filter. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Agricultural pollution incidents in Northern Ireland declined by 51\%
   between 1987 and 1995. This decline resulted from a steady decrease in
   the largest category of farm pollution, silage effluent, which declined
   by 78\%. The decline in silage pollution was most evident in the months
   of May and June and may be related to an observed increase in grass
   wilting, which reduces silage effluent volumes, and favourable weather
   during these months. Non-silage related incidents were 49\% greater in
   1995 than in 1987 and showed no particular trend with time nor the
   distinct annual cycle that was observed for silage pollution. Silage
   effluent represented 51\% of all pollution sources, followed by a
   general category of farm effluent (27\%) and cattle slurry (12\%). No
   other source contributed more than 4\% of the total. An analysis of
   pollution cases showed that, while incidents associated with leaking and
   overflowing effluent tanks and leaking silos all declined, incidents
   where no effluent collection facilities were found increased. This
   increase was considered to be the result of a change in detection
   efficiency rather than an absolute increase in the number of farms
   without effluent collection facilities. Farm pollution statistics from
   Northern Ireland and England and Wales demonstrated similar trends for
   both silage and non-silage related incidents, with no evidence to
   suggest that increases in financial penalties for causing pollution or
   different levels of grant aid had impacted or? long-term trends. Trends
   in pollution statistics from catchments in Northern Ireland targeted for
   pollution advice by agriculture advisory staff did not differ from the
   area as a whole. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of fluidized bed bioparticles for glucose fermentation into
   methane is investigated. As bed stratification occurs, the behaviour of
   biofilms is different along the height of the column. The experimental
   part of this study concerns the characterization of bioparticles coming
   from different heights of a pilot-scale reactor. Biofilm sizes and
   activities are measured. Batch rests are achieved with glucose, acetate
   and propionate as carbon sources in order to estimate the specific
   activity of each trophic group. The experimental sections shows that,
   for thick biofilms, the acidogenic activity is lower and the
   methanogenic activity is higher than for thin films. The modelling part
   describes the relationship between mass transfer limitations (when
   several trophic groups are involved) and biofilm size. The dynamic
   simulations gave a good fit to the experimental batch tests. Both
   simulations and experiments indicates that the biomass composition of
   the biofilm depends on biofilm size. When biofilm thickness increases,
   the amount of acidogens decreases and the amount of methanogens
   increases, mainly because acidogen growth is diffusion-limited. The
   biomass distribution in the biofilm among each trophic group appeared to
   be a very important parameter. This shows that bed stratification has an
   influence not only on the hydrodynamics of the fluidized layer but also
   on the kinetics of organic carbon elimination by methanogenic biofilms.
   This phenomenon has to be taken into account for further modelling and
   design of fluidized bed fermenters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Under oxygen-limited conditions, both aerobic respiration and
   methanogenesis were accomplished by a mixed culture developed from a
   municipal anaerobic digester sludge and maintained under batch
   conditions. Oxygen-limited systems were maintained for over 130 days,
   producing methane and biomass while consuming oxygen under stable
   conditions,with chemical oxygen demand (GOD) removal averaging 92\%.
   Typically, the dissolved oxygen in the culture medium was zero. However,
   short periods of greater-than-zero dissolved oxygen were evident. In
   this case, methanogens were not killed by dissolved oxygen, bur may have
   been inhibited during oxic periods Electron equivalent balances were
   employed to construct stoichiometric equations for propionate-and
   ethanol-fed cultures that received enough oxygen to oxidize
   approximately 0, 10, and 30\% of the added substrate. Oxygen-limited
   cultures exhibited maximum yield coefficients (Y) of between 0.06 and
   0.11 g volatile suspended solids per gram GOD. These values are more
   typical of methanogenic, rather than aerobic systems. Under some
   conditions, it may be possible to achieve low COD values associated with
   aerobic systems and produce the minimum waste biomass associated with
   methanogenic systems in a single-sludge, oxygen-limited process. Other
   possible benefits of methanogenic, oxygen-limited systems include:
   degradation of specific organics and mixtures of organics that proceed
   through both reductive and oxidative biological reactions; degradation
   of specific organics through cometabolic, methanotrophic reactions;
   concurrent nitrification and denitrification; and description of natural
   systems under oxygen-limited conditions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The effect of hydraulic loading rate (HLR; 5 to 20 cm day(-1)) and

   two temperatures (28 degrees C and 35 degrees C) in 18 flow-through
   sediment-water wetland microcosms that were fed nitrate-contaminated
   water (30 mg N L-1). Nitrate removal efficiencies varied from 8\% to
   >95\%, decreasing with increasing HLRs and increasing with increasing
   carbon addition rates. The effect of HLR, and carbon addition rate were
   integrated into the C:N ratio, which alone was highly predictive of
   nitrate removal efficiency. As nitrate removal efficiencies increased,
   dissolved organic carbon in the effluent also increased, as did
   chloroform formation potential. Nitrate-treatment wetlands may be a
   feasible method of remediating nitrate-contaminated groundwater. (C)

Abstract = {{Natural sodium borate minerals from non-marine evaporite sequences are
   used for world production of sodium perborate, an industrially
   manufactured bleaching agent added to a variety of detergent
   formulations and cleaning products. During end use, water-soluble boron
   compounds are discharged with domestic aqueous effluents into sewage
   treatment plants, where little or no boron is removed and, hence, the
   anthropogenic boron load is almost entirely released into the aquatic
   environment. Natural sodium borate minerals are characterized by a
   rather narrow range in boron isotopic composition within the large
   natural variations, such that an isotopic approach may be used to
   decipher an anthropogenic boron source (mainly from industrial
   perborate, the dominant use of mined boron) in a given natural aquatic
   system that is characterized by a distinctive local background
   signature. This paper presents new boron isotope data for a series of
   industrial sodium perborate monohydrate and tetrahydrate products.
   B-11/B-10 isotopic ratios were measured by NTIMS (Negative Thermal
   Ionization Mass Spectrometry) with an analytical uncertainty of +/-
   0.5\% (2 sigma(mean)). Boron isotope values of sodium perborate
   monohydrate and tetrahydrate products, reported as delta(11)B values (in
   per mille) relative to a mean B-11/B-10 ratio of 4.00125 measured for
   the NIST SRM-951 boric acid standard (delta(11)B =
   \{{[}(B-11/B-10)Sample/(B-11/B-10)Standard]-1\}x10(3)), show variations
   from -3.9 to +0.9\% and -4.8 to +0.5\%, respectively, which are within
   the delta(11) B range of natural sodium borate minerals. The application
   of this innovative stable isotope tracer technique for monitoring
   pollution of natural aquatic systems is discussed in the framework of
   two case studies which demonstrate the usefulness of boron isotopes for
   constraining distinct solute sources (anthropogenic vs natural) in
   groundwater. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the area of biological wastewater treatment, the more common approach
   to dynamical modelling has been the use of mechanistic models with
   differential equations. This study illustrates that multivariate time
   series analysis can he a valid alternative. A lab-scale activated sludge
   unit, treating brewery wastewater, was operated with a highly variable
   GOD-load. For design and operation purposes, we wanted to model the
   behaviour of biomass and effluent-quality. Because of the dynamic nature
   of the system, it was not possible to use steady-state relations. With
   time series analysis, we succeeded in modelling the dynamic behaviour,
   using only daily routine measurements. Simple equations, describing
   biomass, effluent COD and effluent suspended solids are obtained and
   combined to form one system of difference equations. The use of this
   system is basically equivalent to the use of models consisting of
   differential equations. Thus by means of simulations, design and
   operation alternatives can be evaluated. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Microbial oxidation of biologically produced elemental sulphur was
   studied in a continuous bubble-column reactor. This sulphur was supplied
   from a sulphide oxidizing bioreactor as a suspension or as a suspended
   sulphur powder. The work focused on two aspects:(1) investigation of the
   bio-chemical stability of a biologically-produced sulphur suspension
   when exposed to aeration at pH 8 in a bioreactor, and (2) sulphuric acid
   production resulting from oxidation of biologically produced sulphur by
   acidophilic thiobacilli. At pH 8, biomass growth showed an apparent
   Monod kinetics: At dilution rates of 0.1 up to 0.35 h(-1) 35-40\% of
   easily available sulphur was oxidized. At D <0.1 h(-1), the sulphur
   conversion al pH = 8 steeply increased, reaching ultimately values of
   80-90\%. In acidophillic conditions in the bioreactor, the maximum
   sulfuric acid production rate was-searched for. The lowest pH value
   reached in the bioreactor was 1.7, whilst a maximum sulphuric acid
   production rate of 1 mmol H2SO4 . L-1 h(-1) was found. The possible
   application of the acidification process for bioleaching is discussed.

Abstract = {{A method was devised to separate and quantify the concentrations of
   orthophosphate and polyphosphates (tripolyphosphate and pyrophosphate)
   in sewage samples. Phosphate species were separated by anion exchange
   chromatography using Dowex 1-X8 resin (100-200 mesh, Cl- form). The use
   of a 0.2 M KCl/acetate buffer (pH 4.5) solution (100 mL) to elute
   orthophosphate and a 0.4 M KCl/ acetate buffer (pH 4.5) solution (100
   mL) to elute polyphosphates, quantitatively eluted phosphorus from the
   resin. Recoveries of 97 +/- 2\% for orthosphosphate and 98 +/- 3\% for
   polysphosphates were achieved for a variety of mixtures of
   orthophosphate, tripolyphosphate and pyrophosphate. Recoveries of
   orthophosphate and tripolyphosphate added to sewage were 95-97\% and
   88\% respectively. The use of EDTA in eluents as used in previous
   studies was found to cause an interference when phosphorus was
   quantified using the phosphoantimonylmolybednum blue method. Analysis of
   centrifuged raw sewage samples revealed that phosphorus was present
   mainly as orthophosphate, no polyphosphates were detected. It is likely
   that polyphosphates are hydrolysed prior to entering sewers because of
   extreme pH and temperatures encountered during clothes and dishwashing
   or in sewers by bacteria or cations. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Red mud (which is a waste material formed during the production of
   alumina and primarily contains ferric and aluminium oxides) was used as
   an adsorbent for the removal of phosphate ions from water using
   crossflow microfiltration. it is shown that phosphate ions act as a
   coagulant for red mud particles, forming a compressible cake with a
   compressibility index of unity. As shown also by dead-end filtration
   experiments, the cake resistance decreases with increasing phosphate
   concentration. The phosphate rejection is a strong function of feed
   dispersion pH, phosphate and red mud concentration ratio as well as the
   concentration of co-ions such as sulphate ions used to adjust the
   dispersion pH. Under certain conditions, especially when pH = 5.2,
   steady state permeate flux and phosphate rejection reach a maximum with
   100\% rejection achievable. The permeate also contain metal ion
   impurities originating from red mud and their concentrations increase
   with increasing red mud concentration and decreasing pH. The effects of
   other process variables, crossflow velocity and membrane pore size on
   phosphate rejection and permeate flux are also studied. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This study presents a specific process control strategy, i.e. sludge
   pre-recycle control, for a dynamic enhanced biological phosphorus
   removal (EBPR) system by integratedly considering two factors: (1)
   appropriately controlling F/M ratio in the anaerobic zone and (2)
   eliminating hydraulic shock in the secondary clarifier. Fuzzy logic
   inference is also introduced while constructing an on-line controller
   owing to the ill-defined characteristics of the dynamic enhanced
   biological phosphorus removal system. For comparison, continuous-flow
   pilot plant experiments with automatic monitoring and real-time control
   facilities are performed using two control strategies: sludge
   pre-recycle control and conventional (F/M)(an) control. Experimental
   results indicate that similar effluent ranges of dissolved COD and
   dissolved phosphate can be obtained from the two strategies due to their
   similar (F/M)(an) ratios. However, reliability analysis reveals that
   sludge pre-recycle control improves the effluent total SS concentration
   significantly more than conventional (F/M)(an) control because of the
   reduction of hydraulic loading in the clarifier. Therefore, sludge
   pre-recycle control is highly desired because of its ability to reduce
   the hydraulic loading in the secondary clarifier at peak loading period
   and, at the same time, maintain a similar (F/M)(an) ratio in the
   biological reactor as conventional (F/M)(an) control. Moreover,
   statistical correlation of effluent qualities indicates that suspended
   COD and suspended phosphorus contents are proportional to total SS.
   Based on these findings, we can infer that when in the operation stage,
   the effluent total SS control is of critical consideration to system
   performance. This inference verifies the effectiveness of sludge
   pre-recycle control by introducing the hydraulic loading factor into the
   control strategy. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of gamma radiation for the disinfection of municipal sewage
   was assessed at the Sludge Hygienization Research Irradiator (SHRI) at
   Baroda city, Gujarat, India. It was observed that a gamma radiation dose
   of 2 kGy could effectively reduce the coliform load in raw sewage to
   acceptable safe levels of less than 100 cfu/ml. The treated effluents
   from the primary and final settling tanks required lower doses of
   radiation as the initial microbial load in the treated effluents was low
   compared to that in the raw sewage. The physicochemical parameters of
   the effluents such as electrical conductivity, total hardness, chemical
   oxygen demand (GOD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and dissolved
   oxygen, remained largely unaltered after exposure to gamma irradiation.
   These effluents could hence be gainfully employed in agricultural
   practice after radiation disinfection. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Anaerobic biotransformation of the 3-carbon compounds, namely acrolein,
   acrylic acid, allyl alcohol, and n-propanol was investigated in upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket (:UASB) reactors containing granular cultures.
   The toxic effects of acrolein, acrylic acid, and allyl alcohol on an
   acetate-enriched Methanosarcina culture were determined. Furthermore,
   process staging, effect of operational parameters such as influent
   concentration, F/M ratio and loading rate were also considered.
   Acrolein, acrylic acid, and allyl alcohol were found to be inhibitory to
   acetate-enriched Methanosarcina cultures starting from the
   concentrations of 20, 60, and 3000 mg/l, respectively. Inhibition is
   defined as the reduction in the activity (in terms of gas production
   rate) of a batch reactor relative to its activity before the addition of
   the test chemical. The results of UASB experiments revealed that
   granular cultures could be acclimated to utilize acrolein, acrylic acid,
   allyl alcohol, and n-propanol as the sole substrates. Acrolein
   concentrations up to 300 mg/l were treated with 90\% efficiency. In a
   single-stage UASB reactor, acrylic acid biotransformation and chemical
   oxygen demand (GOD) removal efficiencies of 95-99 and 45\%,
   respectively, were achieved at an influent concentration of 3000 mg/l.
   The low COD removal was due to persistence of acetic and propionic
   acids, as intermediates of acrylic acid. When a two-stage UASB system
   was employed at the same acrylic acid influent concentration, the COD
   removal efficiency increased to 97\%. At an F/M ratio of 0.027 g COD/g
   biomass-day, 1000 mg/l of influent allyl alcohol was removed at an
   efficiency of about 85\% after 30 days of acclimation in a single-stage
   UASB reactor. n-Propanol was biotransformed to mainly propionic acid
   with more than 99\% efficiency at an influent concentration and F/M
   ratio of 3000 mg/l and 0.27 g COD/g biomass-day, respectively, in a
   single-stage UASB reactor. But the COD removal did not exceed 68\%
   because of the propionic acid persistence. However, a two-stage UASB
   system improved the COD removal to 99\% for the same n-propanol influent
   concentration of 3000 mg/l. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper numerically evaluates the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on
   an individual floc moving steadily through an quiescent Newtonian fluid
   over a wide ranee of Reynolds numbers. The floc is modelled as a highly
   porous sphere, whose interior flow field is governed by the combined
   Darcy -Brinkman model: while the bulk fluid field is governed by
   Navier-Stokes equations. We used a computational fluid dynamics
   software, FIDAP 7.5, to solve the fluid field within and around the
   moving floc, from which the corresponding hydrodynamic drag force
   exerted on the floc is subsequently obtained. When the floc permeability
   is rather high, which is usually the case for activated sludge flocs,
   the drag force was Found to be inversely proportional to the flee
   Reynolds number. The floc density versus size relationship obtained on
   the basis of the Stokes law-like correlation is thereby applicable to
   estimate the flocs' fractal dimension. however, is erroneous for
   estimating the Roc density. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A three-vessel system (3-V system) that has three equal-volume
   compartments was used for oxidizing inorganic synthetic wastewater
   containing 500 mg-l(-1) NH4-N. This system was inoculated with
   polyethylene glycol granular activated sludge. Inorganic synthetic
   wastewater was supplied to the first vessel at the granular loading rate
   of 15 g-N.(l-granule)(-1)d(-1) (volumetric loading rate of 3.0-g N
   l(-1)d(-1)), which is 5.0 g-N (l-granule)(-1) d(-1) (volumetric loading
   rate of 1.0 g-N l(-1)d(-1)) overall, respectively. About half of the
   NH4-N supplied was oxidized in the first compartment and the remaining
   half was oxidized in the second compartment. Nitrite oxidation was not
   significantly detected in the first two compartments, but that solely
   occurred at high levels in the third compartment. The results suggest
   that these nitrification processes may be incompatible, resulting in a
   series of sequential reactions in the 3-V system. It was hypothesized
   that different nitrifying populations came to predominate in each
   compartment by partitioning the vessel. It was reproducibly observed
   that about half of the NH4-N supplied to a single-vessel system at the
   granular loading rate of 5.0 g-N(l-granule)(-1)d(-1) remained Thus,
   complete ammonia oxidation was first achieved and ammonia-and
   nitrite-oxidizing populations can be segregated by the 3-V system. (C)

Abstract = {{Sulphide is known as an inhibiting substance, in anaerobic microbial
   processes. The objective of this research was to examine sulphide
   inhibition in batch and continuous culture experiments. A real
   wastewater of leather production was used which contained high sulphide
   and low sulphate concentrations. Thus the observed inhibition resulted
   from direct toxicity of sulphide on bacteria. Trace element
   precipitation and substrate competition between sulphate reducing and
   methane producing bacteria were of negligible influence. In batch
   experiments gas production was delayed with increased sulphide
   concentrations. A stripping system was integrated in a laboratory
   reactor to eliminate sulphide and to improve the efficiency of
   degradation. In a continuous flow fixed film reactor the concentration
   of 100 mg l(-1) undissociated sulphide inhibited the efficiency and
   degree of degradation. This inhibition was eliminated by a simultaneous
   sulphide stripping system which reduced the concentration of
   undissociated sulphide to 30 mg l(-1). The efficiency of degradation was
   improved by 15\% at a hydraulic retention time of 1.9 days. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A model turbid water was treated by coagulation-flocculation and
   sedimentation, with Moringa oleifera seeds as a coagulant, using jar
   tests. The quality of the treated water was analyzed and compared with
   that of the water treated with alum. Experiments were conducted at
   various dosages of the crude 5\% water extract of both dry, shelled and
   non-shelled Moringa oleifera seeds. Measurements of pH, conductivity,
   alkalinity, cation and anion concentrations, showed that coagulation
   with Moringa oleifera seeds did not significantly affect the quality of
   the treated water. However, concentration of organic matter in the
   treated water increased considerably with the dosage of Moringa
   solution. Since this organic matter might exert a chlorine demand and
   also act as precursor of trihalomethanes during the disinfection with
   chlorine, it is suggested that Moringa oleifera a seeds be used as a
   coagulant in water and wastewater treatment, only after an adequate
   purification of the active proteins. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of elevated volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations, as
   distinct From pH, on the methanogenic degradation of butyrate and
   valerate were determined. Microbial associations capable of degrading
   butyrate or valerate were enriched from municipal refuse and stabilised
   in multi-stage continuous culture systems. The responses of these
   associations to each of the applied acids (100 mmol l(-1) acetate,
   propionate, or butyrate) indicated that the butyrate-and
   valerate-degrading associations were characterized by different
   populations of acetogenic and sulphate-reducing bacteria, despite being
   enriched from the same refuse source. The sulphate reducing bacteria
   were generally more susceptible to elevated VFA concentrations than the
   methanogens. Propionate promoted methanogenesis in the presence of
   bacteria capable of metabolising this fatty acid, but had an inhibitory
   effect on butyrate oxidation. In most cases, 100 mmol l(-1) acetate
   indirectly inhibited methane production. It was thus recommended that
   leachate concentrations of acetate and propionate should be closely
   monitored, since the onset of methanogenesis in landfill sites may be
   delayed by elevated levels of these volatile fatty acids, rather than
   the concomitant reduction in leachate pH. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Bacillus subtilis cells, thermally killed by exposing dried cells to 280
   degrees C for 2.5 mins, were used for fabricating the biofilm attached
   to a dissolved oxygen probe. The dead cell biosensor showed good sensing
   characteristics for the BOD of aqueous organic solutions and wastewaters
   in regard to its response and recovery times, reproducibility and
   stability. It has a significantly long life span of several months,
   requiring only simple storage at room temperature in phosphate buffer in
   between measurements and even over extended idling periods for which
   microbial sensors would normally require food and nutrient additions for
   their sustenance. The sensitivity of the biosensor towards 24 organic
   solutes were generally comparable with biosensors using living Bacillus
   subtilis cells and the American Public Health Association (APHA) method
   of measurement using activated sludge. The high diffusion resistance of
   the membranes was experimentally verified to have caused the long
   response time for soluble starch. The BOD8 of some real wastewater and
   synthetic water samples were determined and compared with the BOD5
   obtained by the APHA method. The deviation of the biosensor values from
   the APHA values depends on the difference in the sensitivity of the
   device and the microbial system towards the compounds in the test
   sample. Nevertheless the deviation was similar to those generally
   observed among the APHA values reported for a given substrate by
   different analysts and laboratories. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Taste, odour and cyanobacterial toxins are not generally removed during
   conventional water treatment and can sometimes be increased during the
   treatment process due to cell lysis. Some reasons for this have been
   documented in the literature, but there appears to be contradictory
   evidence regarding the effect of flocculation. In an earlier study,
   aluminium sulphate did not appear to cause lysis of cells of cultured
   Microcystis aeruginosa or Anabaena circinalis, nor increase the amount
   of microcystin-LR or geosmin in the water. In this study the effect of
   ferric chloride an cultured cells of M. aeruginosa and A. circinalis was
   evaluated at concentrations that would occur in a water treatment plant.
   The results showed that ferric chloride did not appear to cause cell
   lysis of cultured M. aeruginosa and A. circinalis. However, ferric
   chloride seemed to stimulate growth of both M. aeruginosa and A.
   circinalis in the experiments with South Para Reservoir Water. (C) 1998

   industry for a period of 5 years was determined: Populations of
   sulphate-reducing, methanogenic, syntrophic and homoacetogenic bacteria
   were found to prevail in the reactor sludge. The degradation patterns of
   several key anaerobic intermediates were studied. Both propionate and
   H-2/CO2 were completely metabolised by sulphate reducing bacteria.
   Methanogenic bacteria outcompeted sulphate-reducers for acetate, whereas
   competition took place for butyrate and ethanol. The outcome of
   competition in the sludge was not affected by the location within the

Abstract = {{Non-parametric statistical techniques, specifically Multi-Dimensional
   Scaling (MDS), Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) and Similarity
   Percentages (SIMPER) are used to resolve the spatial variability of
   sediment composition based on major element distribution within and
   between two reservoirs in adjacent catchments which were to be used as
   the experimental and control sites in a de-stratification experiment.
   MDS analysis indicates that sediments separate into four groups, three
   from one dam and one from the second dam. ANOSIM analysis showed that
   there was a statistically significant difference between these four
   groups. SIMPER analysis shows that there is a high, degree of similarity
   for sites within each of the four groups. In all cases, greater than
   60\% of the similarity within each group was explained by three
   elements--Si, Al and Fe. However, the elements responsible for the
   dissimilarity between groups of sites were more variable. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The effect of pH variation, within the range 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.5 and 9,
   on activated sludge denitrification of a synthetic wastewater containing
   2700 mg/l NO3-N was examined using bench-scale Sequencing Batch
   Reactors. Two major effects were observed. One, at pH values of 6.5 and
   7.0, denitrification of a synthetic wastewater containing high nitrate
   levels was significantly inhibited, Two, denitrification was achieved at
   higher pH values of 7.5, 8.5 and 9.0, but the accumulation of nitrite
   increased significantly as mixed liquor pH increased with peak values of
   250, 500 and 900 mg/l NO2-N, respectively. As the pH rose, the specific
   rate of nitrate reduction increased. Al the same time the specific rate
   of nitrite reduction increased in the absence of nitrate. In the
   presence of nitrate the specific rate of nitrate reduction remained
   constant, and the degree to which nitrite reduction increased in the
   absence of nitrate was a function of increasing pH. While increasing pH
   from 7.5 to 9.0 affected nitrite intermediate accumulation, the overall
   time for complete denitrification (reduction of both NO3- and NO2-) was
   similar for the pH values of 7.5, 8.5 and 9.0 (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A dissolved oxygen (DO) equation for a stream is developed in which the
   biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) deoxygenation rate is described as a

   may be evaluated by graphical or numerical methods. The DO sag equation
   incorporates exponential integral functions. These functions are
   available in tabular form or they may be calculated by exact or
   approximate series. The time at which the minimum DO concentration
   occurs is calculated numerically. The DO sag equation using.
   second-order BOD model fills a gap in the literature, as a number of in
   investigators had explored describing BOD decay as a second-order

Abstract = {{The rational design and simulation of biotreatment systems requires
   sound mathematical models and reliable parameter estimates.
   Biodegradation kinetics are usually modelled using the Monod or Andrews
   equation, and model parameters are usually obtained by fitting an
   observed concentration-time profile to the model. Since the nature of
   the models and the method of parameter estimation result in correlation
   between the parameters, the question arose as to how to obtain a single
   set of Parameters Representing the Average mu-S response (referred to as
   PRAMUS values) from replicate sets of experimentally derived parameter
   estimates. The common approach of using the arithmetic mean parameter
   values was adequate only for data conforming to the Monod model,
   particularly when the variability among replicate parameter estimates
   was small. For the Andrews model, nonlinear regression was used to
   obtain PRAMUS values, The ability of the PRAMUS and mean parameter
   values to reproduce the average mu-S response and to simulate
   experimentally observed oxygen uptake was evaluated. On this basis, the
   use of PRAMUS values is recommended, particularly when dealing with
   systems modelled by the Andrews equation, with experimental data
   characterized by a high degree of experimental variability, and/or with
   process situations where high substrate concentrations are likely to be
   encountered, e.g. shock loads. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A methodology has been developed to estimate some process parameters for
   an intermittently aerated completely mixed (IACM) system used for carbon
   oxidation, nitrification and denitrification. The approach is able to
   distinguish between heterotrophic and autotrophic microorganisms, and
   can account for the variation of kinetic parameters under aerobic and
   anoxic conditions. The method of least squares was employed to solve a
   set of equations to obtain yield and decay rates for heterotrophs,
   whereas a trial-and-error approach was used for autotrophs. A weighting
   matrix was incorporated into the equations to consider the variation in
   the number of experimental data points. Parameters determined in this
   paper include heterotrophic biomass yield and decay rates for aerobic
   and anoxic periods, autotrophic biomass yield and decay rate,
   nitrification rate, denitrification rate, cell nitrogen to carbon
   consumption ratio, and fraction of autotrophic biomass. The aeration
   fraction affects the effective aerobic and anoxic hydraulic retention
   times of the IACM process, which in turn affect the other parameters.

   turbidity - and microbiological water quality - aerobic plate count,
   total and fecal coliforms, fecal streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa

   variable was disinfectant concentration based on the linear model P = a

   interception; b = gradient, and X = disinfection concentration). At the
   chlorinated pools 2.6 mg l(-1) of free chlorine (a = 0.34, b = 0.21) was

Abstract = {{Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is a powerful tool for the
   determination of molecular size of compounds. However, the conducted SEC
   analysis of 35 humic substances (HS) samples demonstrated, that it has
   some severe pitfalls fur the molecular weight characterization of HS
   resulting from a lack of appropriate standards. To overcome this
   problem. a new approach to calculation of molecular weight from the SEC
   data was developed. It is based on the correction of the experimentally
   determined distribution coefficient (K-d) values according to the
   predictive equations derived tither from the data on charge density and
   hydrophobicity of the analyte or from the values of its characteristic
   structural parameters. Verification of both predictive equations using
   model compounds has displayed much better prognostic potential of the
   polynomial equation developed with a use of integral structural
   parameters of the analyte. Application of this predictive equation to
   synthetic polyelectrolytes gave satisfactory estimates for all the
   polymers with K-d>0.15. The model calculation for an averaged sample of
   HS allowed to estimate a difference between the ideal and experimental
   values of K-d(Delta K-d) by a value of 0.02. The correspondent
   correction of the SEC-data of 35 HS samples showed overestimation of the
   values of molecular weight of HS determined by the standard data
   handling technique. The obtained model estimations are to be verified
   along with the further development of the model based on the adjustment
   of the model assumptions to specific polyelectrolytic properties of HS.

Abstract = {{The sorption onto kaolinite of Pb, Cd, Ni and Cu from a landfill
   leachate was studied in relation to the metal speciation in the liquid
   phase. Metal speciation was determined by two different experimental
   procedures based on the exchangeability on a cation chelating resin
   (Chelex100) and on the separation by dialysis with membranes at
   different molecular weight (MW) cut off. The speciation procedures were
   applied on the leachate before and after equilibration with clay, in
   order to determine the contribution of the different fractions to the
   total sorption. As determined by the MW-based procedure, large fractions
   of dissolved metals were associated to substances with high MW (> 1000
   and > 12000 daltons), even if these substances represent only 18\% of
   the total organic content (as determined by chemical oxygen demand,
   COD). These high-MW fractions contribute to metal sorption onto
   kaolinite, as also confirmed by the concurrent removal of COD and
   phenolic substances. As determined by the exchange-based procedure, the
   main contribution to metal sorption derived from free/labile (rapidly
   exchangeable) or slowly exchangeable Fractions. However, Pb and Cd were
   also removed from the stable/inert (not exchangeable) fraction. Because
   metal sorption is partially due to species that are not exchangeable on
   Chelex100 and partially to species that have MW more than 1000 daltons,
   these experimental evidences strongly support that free metals are not
   the only species participating in the sorption onto kaolinite and that
   some metal species are adsorbed without previous dissociation. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of organic matter on the
   conservation rates of nitrogenous compounds in a deep mixed films
   channel reactor under high dissolved organic (DO) and various flow
   conditions. A series of batch tests was performed to examine the effects
   of organic matter, with and without the addition of glucose, on
   variations of the nitrogenous compounds. Experimental results indicated
   that increasing the organic matter concentration under all flow
   conditions decreased the concentrations of nitrate and total nitrogens;
   however, an enormous build-up of nitrite occurred in the water column.
   Also, the conversion pathways of nitrogenous compounds changed from
   ammonification and nitrification to assimilation, ammonium oxidation and
   denitrification. Moreover, changing the flow velocity significantly
   influenced the conversion rates of nitrification and denitrification.
   When adding organic matter, the rate of nitrite to gaseous products
   became greatly enhanced if the flow velocity increased within the
   turbulent regime; increasing velocity seemed only to inhibit the rate of
   conversion from nitrate to nitrite. In contrast, when organic matter was
   not added, the rates of ammonium oxidation exceeded those of nitrite
   oxidation within all flow regimes. Experimental results further
   demonstrated that nitrite oxidation was the rate-limiting process of
   nitrification under the low organic matter conditions. On the other
   hand, when sufficient amounts of organic matter were present, the
   processes of nitrite to gaseous products and nitrate to nitrite
   dominated the rate of denitrification under the laminar and turbulent
   regimes, respectively. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{On the basis of the thermodynamic hypothesis and using the thermodynamic
   approach, a binding strength was calculated to define the physical
   meaning of bound water content of sludge as measured by dilatometer. The
   sludge samples considered in this study included kaolin, alum and
   biological sludge. The binding strength of bound water at -20 degrees C
   was calculated as 24.5 kJ/kg, which is close to that of the normal
   physico-adsorption process. Most of the frozen moisture in st
   dilatometric measurement should be interstitial water or vicinal water.
   Results also indicated that moisture with a lower binding strength
   easily became free water. The release of interstitial water from sludge
   flocs would cause less bound water. When solid concentration is higher,
   the expelling strength induced by the compacting action of sludge flocs
   is increased over the binding strength, thereby forcing out the
   interstitial water. Lower bound water contents are attained. Accurate
   measurement of bubble volumes with the calculated stem on the top of the
   dilatometer could improve the precision of expansion coefficient and
   bound water content measurement. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The expression characteristics of original and freeze/thaw conditioned
   waste activated sludges were experimentally evaluated. Results in this
   study indicate that the first two stages of expression (primary and
   secondary consolidation) are similar to those of a particulate system,
   on which the model analysis by Shirato et al. (1974) is applicable. In
   the final phase of the expression of biological sludge, however, an
   unexpected constant-rate consolidation period, termed herein the ternary
   consolidation period, is observed. A modified combined Terzaghi-Voigt
   rheological model is proposed to describe the relation between void
   ratio and compressive pressure of the sludge cake. Whereas the resulting
   governing equation is solved analytically and the model parameters are
   found by regression analysis. The ternary consolidation is speculated to
   arise from the erosion of strongly bound moisture from the biological
   particles. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aluminum-oxide-coated sand (AOCS) was evaluated for the removal of
   selenite (Se(IV)) and selenate (Se(VI)) from water. Quartz sand was
   coated at 70 degrees C using 1 M AlCl3 solution aging for 2 d at various
   coating pH (pH((coating))). The characteristics of the AOCS surface were
   Ph-(coating)-dependent. The Al oxide coating was an X-ray
   noncrystalline, porous compound at low pH((coating)), while at high
   ph((coating)) the AOCS could better withstand acid/alkali and the
   coatings tended to form crystalline boehmite and bayerite. Adsorption of
   Se(IV) and Se(VI) was more effective using sand coated at low
   pH((coating)) than at high pH((coating)). AOCS produced at pH((coating))
   5.98 had optimum properties and was employed as the adsorbent for the
   present adsorption studies. Adsorption experiments of Se(IV) and Se(VI)
   by AOCS performed as a function of pH, initial concentration, reaction
   time, and competing ion concentrations were examined. Removal of Se(IV)
   and Se(IV) increased with decreasing pH but was obviously greater for
   Se(IV) than Se(VI). In Se(IV) and Se(VI) mixed systems, the adsorption
   of Se(IV) was evidently inhibited by Se(VI) only at system pH ranging
   from 3 to 8, and the degree of inhibition was similar at Se(VI) to
   Se(IV) molar ratios of 1 and 3. However, Se(VI) adsorption significantly
   decreased with increasing Se(IV) concentration at all system pH. The
   sequence of foreign anions competing with respect to Se(IV) and Se(VI)
   adsorption was in the order of SO42-> HCO3-. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Simultaneous denitrification and nitrification may exist in natural
   biological processes provided that there is an environment suitable for
   photosynthesis. To determine whether it is possible to remove both
   nitrate and ammonia from drainage water by natural biological processes,
   several batch experiments were conducted in some shallow plastic tanks
   simulating natural biological processes in laboratory. The experiments
   showed that simultaneous denitrification and nitrification was possible.
   A batch experiment in a dark environment confirmed the dependence of
   nitrification on photosynthesis, i.e., photosynthesis was a major oxygen
   source for nitrification. Nitrification could proceed even at very low
   dissolved oxygen concentrations (0.2-0.6 mg/l). Raw pig slurry was used
   as an external carbon source for denitrification, its high COD
   concentration led to complete denitrification. When fibrous carriers
   were packed into the tanks, biomass developed on them, improved the
   processes of both denitrification and nitrification. It is concluded
   that a water depth shallow enough for photosynthesis to occur is
   critical for nitrogen removal from drainage water by natural biological
   processes such as basins or ponds/lagoons. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Quantitative behaviour of zebrafish, Danio rerio, was recorded to assess
   and predict longterm sublethal effects of the cyanobacteria toxin
   microcystin-LR (MCYST-LR; nominal concentrations of 0.5, 5, 15 and 50 mu
   g litre(-1)) by using the automated BehavioQuant(R). The exposure to
   MCYST-LR caused dose-effect related changes in spontaneous locomotor
   activity. Whereas the two lower exposure concentrations (0.5 and 5 mu g
   litre(-1)) caused an increase in daytime motility, elevated exposures
   led to significantly decreased motilities. The highest exposure (50 mu g
   litre(-1)) also reduced the spawning activity and success. In contrast
   to daytime activities, night-time swimming activity was significantly
   greater at the higher MCYST-LR exposures. The chronobiological analysis
   indicated a phase shift of maximum swimming activities and a lowered
   reaction on trigger points like feeding, al dusk and dawn. Furthermore,
   the results indicate some adverse consequences in reproduction success
   and in the spatial and temporal fit of the fish into its habitat. (C)

Abstract = {{Dense mars of Thioploca spp., gliding filamentous sulfur-oxidizing
   bacteria were first found in Japan in the sediments of the profundal
   areas of Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan. Thioploca spp. were
   widely distributed in the northern basin of Lake Biwa and were
   morphologically similar to Thioploca ingrica. The biomass of Thioploca
   was estimated and compared between the upper (0-2 cm) and the lower
   (deeper than 2 cm) layer sediments of three profundal stations. It was
   one to two orders of magnitude larger in the upper layer for all
   stations. Upper layer biomass was also compared among five stations of
   different depths from 3 to 90 m deep, and the most dense trichomes, 5.4m
   per cm(2) exhibited as total trichome length, were observed at the
   profundal station of 90 m deep, larger by three orders of magnitude than
   in the shallow stations. Several facts indicate that Thioploca has
   recently increased on the profundal bottoms of the lake. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Traditional waste stabilisation pond (WSP) models encounter problems
   predicting pond performance because they cannot account for the
   influence of pond features, such as inlet structure or pond geometry, on
   fluid hydrodynamics. In this study, two dimensional (2-D) computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) models were compared to experimental residence time
   distributions (RTD) from literature. In one of the-three geometries
   simulated, the 2-D CFD model successfully predicted the experimental
   RTD. However, flow patterns in the other two geometries were not well
   described due to the difficulty of representing the three dimensional
   (3-D) experimental inlet in the 2-D CFD model, and the sensitivity of
   the model results to the assumptions used to characterise the inlet.
   Neither a velocity similarity nor geometric similarity approach to inlet
   representation in 2-D gave results correlating with experimental data.
   However. it was shown that 2-D CFD models were not affected by changes
   in values of model parameters which are difficult to predict,
   particularly the turbulent inlet conditions. This work suggests that 2-D
   CFD models cannot be used a priori to give an adequate description of
   the hydrodynamic patterns in WSP. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A history of biological monitoring of river water quality in Britain by
   individual biologists in different regions is briefly traced. The first
   official use of biological methods was in the 1970 National River
   Pollution Survey by the Department of the Environment. Following
   criticism regarding the adequacy of the method used, the Department set
   up the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) to recommend a system
   for use in national river pollution surveys. This paper reviews the
   proceedings of the working group, which led to the recommendation of a
   score system based on benthic macro-invertebrates. The outcome of the
   working group's deliberations regarding levels of identification,
   abundance, zonation and method of sampling are recorded. The principles
   by which the scores were allocated to the different families and the
   reason for having different scores for eroding and depositing substrata
   samples are explained. The hitherto unpublished explanation is provided
   for the significant differences between the score system used in the
   1980 and subsequent River Pollution Surveys and chat recommended in the
   Final Report of BMWP. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The common process of low energy geothermal exploitation is the doublet
   of production- and reinjection borehole. The quality of water reinjected
   into a elastic reservoir is essential for the reliability of an
   injection well. In order to estimate precipitation reactions it is
   necessary to obtain extensive reliable analysis data of the water for
   the use of thermodynamic modelling. For thermal anoxic brines, the
   analysis of major and especially minor ion content is difficult because
   of matrix effects and possible iron precipitation. A selection of
   analysing methods were applied to two anoxic thermal brines of deep
   sandstone aquifers of Northern Germany. Detection limits and measured
   data of the major constituents are presented of Na+, K+, NH4+, Ca2+,
   Mg2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Fe-total, Mn2+, SiO44-, B(OH)(3), Zn2+, Pb2+, Cd2+,
   F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, SO42-, SO32-, S2-, PO43-, NO3-, NO2- and DOC. The
   measurements were done with ICP-OES, ionselective electrodes,
   photometry, polarography, titration methods, ion chromatography and
   TOC-analyzer. Except for SO(4)(2-)and Cl-, the anion analysis was done
   on-site, since the high iron content in the anoxic water requires
   acidification in order to prevent iron hydroxide precipitation.
   The minor constituents Zn2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr3+, Sc3+, Co2+, Y3+,
   La3+, Ce3+, Al3+, were enriched by trace matrix separation using the
   cation exchange resin Chelex((R))100. The element concentrations in the
   acidic eluates of the Chelex((R))100 columns were measured using ICP-MS.
   The pH dependency of the exchange equilibrium at pH values of 4, 5 and 6
   (buffered and unbuffered) as well as the relation to the salt content
   between 35 and 250 gl(-1) total dissolved solids of Na-K-Ca-Mg-Cl-SO4
   were evaluated by sensitivity analysis. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {{Physico-chemical properties and bioavailability of particulate
   phosphorus of various origin in a watershed of Lake Geneva (France)}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The bioavailability of the external loading of phosphorus to lakes is an
   important management concern (Williams et al., 1980; Bostrom et al.,
   1988). This paper examines some physical and chemical properties and the
   bioavailability of phosphorus associated with the particulate fraction
   of samples of sediments collected at various locations within a small 33
   km(2) watershed that is drained by the Redon River into Lake Geneva
   (Fig. 1). The watershed is urbanized near its exit and the upland areas
   include cultivated lands, forested areas and marshes (Pilleboue and
   Dorioz, 1986). Soluble phosphorus enters the river from sewage
   discharges at downstream locations and particulate phosphorus runs off
   into the upstream drainage net from cultivated and forested lands.
   A total of 13 samples were collected once at various locations in the
   watershed during the winter following a three weeks period of low flow.
   Three of these samples were taken from river bottom sediment in the
   downstream reaches (samples 1, 2, 3, Table 1), three were taken from
   ditches draining forested areas (samples 9, 10, 11; Table 1), three were
   taken from small ditches draining intensively cropped areas (samples 6,
   7, 8; Table 1), one sample was taken from the inlet and one from the
   outlet of a wetland receiving agricultural runoff(samples 5, 4; Table 1)
   and two samples were taken from the parent watershed soils (samples 12,
   13; Table 1).
   The physical and chemical properties of the phosphorus associated with
   the sediment particles were evaluated using a variety of chemical
   extraction techniques (Hieltjes and Lijklema, 1980; Fares et al., 1974;
   Olsen et al., 1954). A bioassay method (Fig. 2) was used to evaluate
   phosphorus bioavailability. An isotopic tracer ((PO43-)-P-32) technique
   was used to determine the capability of the sediment particles to fix
   and exchange phosphorus with water (Fardeau, 1981; Tran et al., 1988).
   In this analysis, the fraction of the tracer remaining in solution after
   1 min (rl/R) is an index of phosphorus fixation capacity of the sediment
   (low values of the ratio indicate high fixation capacities) while the
   amount of isotopically exchangeable phosphorus (mg P.kg(-1) exchanged
   with the water in 1 min) gives an estimate of immediately available
   phosphorus (E1).
   One study compared the bioavailability of the sediment phosphorus and
   the fixation capacity of sediment samples taken at various locations in
   the drainage network. The particulate phosphorus in the sediment samples
   taken from the downstream river bottom (1, 2, 3) showed a high
   bioavailability (Table 2 and Fig. 3). These sediments had a high ability
   to release phosphorus and a very low phosphorus fixation capacity in
   comparison to sediment samples taken from ditches draining both the
   forested or agricultural areas (4, 5, 6, 9). The total phosphorus
   content of the sediment samples did not appear to be a good indicator of
   the change in physico-chemical properties of the sediment or in
   phosphorus bioavailability (Table 3).
   Another study (Table 2) compared the physico-chemical properties and the
   bioavailability of particulate phosphorus among (1) the eroded sediments
   (samples 5, 6, 7, 8) collected from ditches draining agricultural areas;
   (2) the uneroded soils (samples 12, 13) of the area, and (3) the
   sediment at the inlet and outlet of the wetland area (Table 4). The
   sediments taken from the drainage ditches had substantially lower
   phosphorus bioavailability levels and increased phosphorus fixation
   capacities when compared to the parent soil of the area. The sediment
   sample collected at the outlet of the wetland showed the highest
   fixation capacity of all the samples collected during this research
   (Table 4, sample 4).
   The bioassay method used to determine phosphorus bioavailability was
   found to be very sensitive to the level of dilution of the sediment
   during the test. For example, In tests on a single sediment where
   concentrations were set at 30 and 300 mg.l(-1), the percentage of total
   phosphorus extracted from the samples was 45\% and 4.2\%, respectively
   (Table 5).
   The results of the studies described in this paper suggest that the
   physico-chemical properties and bioavailability of phosphorus associated
   with sediments vary not only with origin of the sediment, but also with
   the chemical-physical-biological phenomena that occur during transport
   through the watershed system. Figure 4 summarizes how these changes may
   occur as sediment moves through the watershed. Erosion of natural
   forested areas produces sediments with a high fixation capacity and a
   low content in total-P and bioavailable phosphorus. The properties of
   these sediments are strongly modified in the drainage net during low
   flow periods by interaction with sources of soluble phosphorus (Cahill,
   1977; Golterman et al., 1983). The particulate phosphorus from erosion
   of agricultural areas (although somewhat lower in fixation capacity) may
   be modified in the drainage net in the same manner as the sediments from
   natural areas. During high flow events, sediments with high phosphorus
   levels may be diluted and release soluble phosphorus (Dorioz et al.,
   1989). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) are extracted from water onto
   Ambersorb 572, desorbed into dichloromethane (DCM) and analyzed by gas
   chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) at a mass
   resolution of 7000. The use of the granular adsorbent Ambersorb 572
   allows extraction by rolling the sample bottle, isolation of the
   adsorbent by filtration, desorption of the analytes into DCM in the
   autosampler vial and injection without plugging the syringe needle.
   Because there is no sample clean-up, HRMS is necessary to differentiate
   the analytes from chemical interferences when present. Isotope dilution
   quantitation with d(3)-geosmin and d(3)-2-MIB is required because the
   recoveries of geosmin and 2-MIB from water are highly variable. The
   Ambersorb 572/GC-HRMS method with isotope dilution quantitation was
   compared with the closed-loop stripping (CLS)/ GC-low resolution mass
   spectrometry (LRMS) method with external standard quantitation.
   Increased productivity (up to 40 samples/day), faster turnaround times
   (48 h), better between-run precision (7.7\% for geosmin and 5.5\% for
   2-MIB) and accuracy (+/-11\% for geosmin and +/-6\% for 2-MIB) over the
   CLS/GC-LRMS method were achieved. Detection limits of 2.0 ng/L for
   geosmin and 2.0 ng/L for 2-MIB were obtained for the Ambersorb
   572/GC-HRMS method. The method was successfully applied to 152 samples
   from Lake Ontario water supplies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Alumina pillared montmorillonite (AIPMt) and mesoporous alumina aluminum
   phosphates (AAPs) were contacted with aqueous, 2,4-dichlorophenol,
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol solutions, at a
   concentration range between 25 and 250 mu g/litre, in batch equilibrium
   experiments, in order to determine their adsorption properties. The
   removal of chlorophenols by the adsorbents increase with increasing
   chlorine substitution in their molecules. In the case of
   pentachlorophenol, the increased affinity allows adsorption to occur
   much more efficiently than in the case of other compounds. AIPMt
   material adsorbs 26.3\% of 2,4-dichlorophenol, 75.6\% of
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol and 95.2\% of pentachlorophenol at equilibrium.
   The adsorption of chlorophenols on mesoporous AAPs is much less
   pronounced as compared to clays but increases with the ratio of P/Al, as
   the surface acidity of those solids also increases. The AAP mixture with
   a ratio P/Al = 0.6 adsorbs 14.8\% of 2,4-dichlorophenol, 27.1\% of
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol and 58.3\% of pentachlorophenol. The amounts of
   chlorophenols decomposed during the treatment increase in AAPs Ind
   especially in those with a higher P/Al ratio (= 0.6). (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The combined effects of Ni(II) and Cr(VI) on activated sludge kinetics
   were studied in this paper. The metals were added to a synthetic medium
   with a chemical oxygen demand (GOD) of 1300 mgl(-1) to give various
   combinations of Ni(II) and Cr(VI). Activated sludge performance, in
   terms of COD removal, was not adversely affected in an acclimatized
   culture by the metal combinations, compared with the single metals. The
   combination effects of Ni!II) and Cr(VI)on biokinetic constants, i.e.
   the maximum specific growth rate, mu(m), was found to be stimulatory in
   general. The same effect was observed on the half-saturation substrate
   concentration, K-s. Effects were therefore classified as synergistic
   with respect to these constants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{313-320}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Addition of sulfide to activated sludge led to a change of floc
   structure due to specific reduction of Fe(III) to FeS. The change was
   observed as a weakening of the flee strength leading to an increased
   shear sensitivity of the flocs. The degree of disintegration thus
   depended on the shear late in the system. The flee disintegration led to
   the dissolution of up to 10\% of the total organic matter of the flocs
   when all Fe(III) was reduced. Bacteria, organic colloids and dissolved
   extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were released from the
   activated sludge flocs. Laboratory-grown microbial Aocs, grown without
   Fe(III), did not disintegrate upon addition of sulfide, which indicates
   that no direct bacterial response to sulfide occurred. Laboratory-grown
   microbial flocs grown in presence of Fe(III) showed some disintegration
   in the presence of sulfide, but not as much as was observed for
   activated sludge from a treatment plant. From these data and
   microscopical investigations it appears that the matter released was
   mainly EPS, colloids and loosely adhered bacteria, probably arising from
   the wastewater, while the bacterial microcolonies, particularly typical
   of the laboratory-grown flocs, were not affected by the sulfide
   treatment. The changes observed in the flee structure and flee stability
   have important implications for the solid-liquid separation at activated
   sludge treatment plants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   and MMHg to each branch. Concentrations of total Hg during base flow
   were less than 10 ng/l but were 3-5 times higher during storm flow,
   mainly as a result of the high particulate loading (up to 800 mg/l).
   Storm flows are therefore the major vector for Hg transport in this
   river. Total Hg concentrations generally increased as SPM and POC
   increased. However, the K(d) decreased with increasing SPM for both Hg
   and MMHg, and the magnitude of the K(d) was a function of the \%POC,
   suggesting that the strength of particulate binding was a function of
   the organic content of the particles. Reactive Hg was a small fraction
   of the total and there was little relationship between dissolved Hg and
   DOG. Equilibrium calculations suggest that all the dissolved Hg is bound
   to DOC even at the lowest DOC concentrations encountered. Watershed
   yield calculations suggest that the flux from these rivers is a
   relatively large fraction of the atmospheric input, in contrast to what
   has been found in other systems. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A dynamic simulation model of the entire activated sludge process is
   presented. For the biological reactor the standard model by IAWQ, the
   Activated Sludge Model No. 1, is used, and for the continuous
   sedimentation in the secondary clarifier a;new one-dimensional model
   based on the theory of non-linear partial differential equations is
   presented. What is new with the settler model is :hat the numerical
   algorithm is derived only from the conservation law and the constitutive
   batch settling Bur assumption by Kynch (1952), without using any further
   ad hoc assumption (heuristics). The model includes the prediction of the
   concentrations of all biological components of the particulate and
   soluble material within and at the outlets of the settler. Effects such
   as hydrodynamics, biological activity and compression in the settler are
   not taken into account. It is shown how the analytical formulae for a
   steady-state solution in the settler can be used to obtain a
   steady-state solution for the entire system, The main aim of the paper
   is to present how mathematical solutions within the solids flux theory
   can be implemented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The phosphorus (P) load from municipalities to surface waters can be
   markedly reduced using current wastewater treatment technology. However,
   the choice of optimal treatment method and assessment of the
   eutrophication caused by wastewaters are confounded by the unknown
   bioavailability of various P forms in the effluents. We estimated the
   potential bioavailability of total phosphorus (TP) and of three P
   fractions in 20 purified wastewater samples from five municipal
   treatment plants in Finland. All the plants had an activated sludge
   process and simultaneous P precipitation. In addition, two plants had a
   post precipitation unit and the others nitrified wastewater. On average
   36\% (0-67\%) of TP in effluents was utilized by the green alga
   Selenastrum capricornutum Printz in bioassays lasting 2-4 weeks. If P
   became available according to first-order kinetics, the amount of P
   converted into an available form during an extended time frame was
   usually negligible. Dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) appeared to be
   entirely bioavailable, whereas only an average of 22\% (0-74\%) of
   dissolved unreactive phosphorus (DUP) and 25\% (0-54\%) of particulate
   phosphorus (PP) was utilized by algae. Higher relative and absolute
   amounts of P were generally available in the effluents from the
   nitrifying plants than from the post precipitation plants. In addition,
   when the capacity of a plant was exceeded, the concentration of
   bioavailable P in effluents appeared to increase. Our results suggest
   that TP alone is not a satisfactory criterion for use in eutrophication
   control measures of municipal P loading. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The occurrence and temporal distribution of volatile organic compounds
   (VOC) in the Southampton Water estuary located on the coastline of
   central southern England was studied over two periods including
   1987/1988 and 1995. VOC with volatilities of low to medium polarity
   ranging broadly from those of n-butane to n-octadecane were the major
   focus of interest. Over 100 individual compounds were routinely found in
   the larger, semi-industrialised estuary (Southampton Water) which is
   most subject to urban and industrial influences. The types and
   concentrations of VOC identified reflect the juxtaposition of both
   anthropogenic and biogenic influences. In Southampton Water, the most
   abundant VOC classes consisted of aromatic, alkanes, alkenes,
   cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes and chlorinated compounds. Some of the alkene
   VOC were present as terpenes and were derived from both marine and
   terrestrial sources. The distribution of biogenic VOC in Southampton
   Water was significantly influenced on a seasonal basis, and
   characterised by biogenic as well as anthropogenic sources. Marine
   phytoplankton (e.g. particularly the photosynthetic ciliate Mesodinium
   rubrum) exhibited a major influence on the character and distribution of
   VOC within summer months. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The fate of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in the Southampton Water
   estuary, presented in Part 1 of this paper, are described. The principal
   processes responsible for removing VOC from the water column include
   dilution and net transport, volatilisation and adsorption onto
   sediments. Volatilisation is the most important removal mechanism, and
   is significantly influenced by temporal and spatial changes in aqueous
   concentration and by the proximity of sources. Using surface renewal
   models, volatilisation rates ranging from 300 kg day(-1) in summer
   months to 2000 kg day(-1) in winter months were estimated. Within the
   water column, net transport rates were 3 to 5 times higher in winter
   relative to summer, reflecting the influence of enhanced input rates and
   increased dilution flows. Adsorption processes varied widely in their
   efficiency, and were dependent upon the availability of adsorbing solid
   surfaces within the water column and VOC affinity for sorption
   processes. The highest levels of adsorption were identified for
   chloroform in wastewater effluents where the organic matter content of
   suspended solids approached 100\%. Within the estuary as a whole, not
   more than 5\% of VOC such as aromatics and organohalogens was predicted
   to be adsorbed under the most favourable environmental conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{Here we tested the application of a nodal analysis for the elaboration
   of biotic indices for particular stressing conditions. The work was
   carried out in an intermittent Mediterranean stream where superficial
   flow was absent during summer. The river was perturbed by an effluent
   with high pH, sulphates, nitrates and conductivity. ``Summer{''} and
   ``winter{''} samples were treated separately. We first identified groups
   of sites differing in taxonomical composition by cluster analysis. Then
   we tested whether groups of sites also differed in their abiotic
   characteristics. In the following step, groups of cooccurring taxa were
   also identified by cluster analysis. The indicator value of a taxa group
   was measured by fidelity measurements for site groups. Indicator taxa
   were incorporated in a water quality table. The biotic index in the
   water quality table clearly discriminated impacted from reference sites
   in the two following years and was correlated with the first axis of a
   correspondence analysis biplot which also discriminated impacted from
   clean sites. We suggest that nodal analysis can be a reliable technique
   for the identification of bioindicators and the elaboration of biotic
   indices. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands are used to remove pollutants from wastewater. The
   performance of such wetlands to remove pollutants from wastewater can be
   improved by using suitable substrates. In this study the phosphorus (P)
   adsorption capacities of soils, two industrial by-products and a
   clinoptilolite material (zeolite) were examined for their potential use
   as substrates to remove P in constructed wetlands. Both Freundlich and
   Langmuir adsorption isotherms were used to describe the adsorption
   characteristics of these substrates. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm
   was used to calculate the maximum P adsorption capacity of these
   substrates. One of the industrial by-products, namely blast furnace
   slag, showed the highest P adsorption capacity (44.2 g P kg(-1) slag)
   followed by soil samples collected from an operating (Byron Bay)
   constructed wetland system in Northern NSW (4.2 to 5.2 g P kg(-1) soil).
   The surface soils collected from two regional constructed wetland
   systems were found to have the least P adsorption capacity (1153 and 934
   mg P kg(-1) soil, respectively for Richmond and Carcoar wetlands). The
   clinoptilolite material (zeolite), which is used to remove ammonium ion
   from wastewater, was found to have a P adsorption capacity of 2.15 g
   kg(-1). The relationship between P adsorption and oxalate extractable
   iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) showed that P adsorption related more
   closely to extractable Al (r(2) = 0.890) than Fe (r(2) = 0.736).
   Multiple regression analysis showed that P adsorption is more closely
   related to a combination of both oxalate extractable Fe and Al (r(2) =
   0.901) than extractable Fe or Al alone. The P saturation capacity of
   wetland systems incorporating these substrates is described. The results
   suggest that selected industrial by-products and adsorptive materials
   may be used alone or in combination with soils to improve the
   performance of constructed wetland systems subject to other properties
   Such as pH, permeability and structural stability of these materials.

Abstract = {{A multi-stage process has been developed at laboratory scale for the
   removal and recovery of cadmium from dilute aqueous solutions. Metal
   removal is achieved by biosorption of the metal cations onto a free cell
   suspension of dead Streptomyces biomass in a stirred tank reactor. The
   solids are then separated from the aqueous phase by flotation or
   sedimentation. The resulting water, which contains only 10 mu g l(-1)
   residual cadmium, can be safely discharged. The solids are diverted to a
   filtration unit where they become immobilised as a filter cake. The
   biomass is then eluted, using an electrolyte solution as the eluant, in
   order to desorb the bound cadmium ions from the biomass. The eluant is
   drawn through the biomass filter cake under a soft vacuum resulting in
   intimate contact between the eluant and the solids. The elution step
   regenerates the biomass for subsequent biosorption steps and also
   greatly concentrates the cadmium in the eluate with respect to the
   original wastewater. Finally, the cadmium is recovered from the eluate
   by electrolysis using a Rotating Cathode Cell, resulting in cadmium
   powder and cadmium-depleted electrolyte which is recycled as the eluant.
   This process is therefore capable of achieving very effective cadmium
   removal and produces only clean water and solid metal, both commercially
   useful products. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{From anoxic incubated freshwater sediments, initially without inorganic
   nitrogen compounds in the overlying water, remarkable and unexpected N-2
   fluxes were estimated. N-2 leakage from the atmosphere and oxygen
   leakage followed by nitrification and denitrification, two possible
   causes, were thoroughly examined but found to be incorrect. From these
   investigations it was furthermore concluded that the N-2 fluxes are
   real. The fluxes appear only under anoxic conditions and at least one
   step in the forming has to be bic,logical. How these N-2 fluxes were
   formed remained unclear as alternative pathways for the anoxic forming
   of N-2 found in literature did not give an explanation to the source
   and/or mechanism leading to the N-2 fluxes either. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic analysis of aerobic biological treatment of wastewater
   is presented. Previous thermodynamic models have only considered the net
   endogenous decay of biomass. Thermodynamically, endogenous decay is the
   metabolism of the biomass itself to sustain life. Its metabolism results
   in oxidation and resynthesis as well as release of suspended organic
   debris that is refractory in the biological process. These concepts are
   incorporated into the more recent mechanistic IAWQ models. A
   thermodynamic analysis of endogenous resynthesis is made to determine
   the endogenous yield factor and verify concepts in the IAWQ models. The
   endogenous yield factor is not, in general, the same as the yield factor
   from exogenous substrate as assumed in the IAWQ model. The development
   is applied to modeling aerobic sludge digestion. The production of
   refractory suspended solids is a dynamic process that is improperly
   accounted for in existing models. A new model for aerobic digestion is
   proposed based on the revised bioenergetics model. The continuous decay
   of degradable mass and production of refractory suspended solids is
   described in the model. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Influence of a low molecular weight metabolite (citrate) on the toxicity

Abstract = {{Toxicities Of Cd and Zn to the chlorophyte Selenastrum capricornutum
   were determined in synthetic media buffered by 100 mu mol.1(-1) of NTA
   (FRAQ(NTA)) or citrate (FRAQ(CIT)), or in unbuffered FRAQUIL medium
   (FRAQ). Metal speciation in these exposure media was adjusted so gs to
   maintain constant free concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mez+ even while
   the free Zn2+ or Cd2+ concentrations were varied. The growth response of
   the algae to variations in free Zn2+ and free Cd2+ was similar in FRAQ
   and FRAQ(NTA) media, but algal sensitivity to free Zn2+ or free Cd2+
   increased markedly in FRAQ(CIT) medium. Addition of Zn to FRAQ,
   FRAQ(NTA) or FRAQ(CIT) media (0.02-2 mu mol.l(-1) free Zn2+) caused a
   decrease in the algal growth rate, but the algae remained in exponential
   growth just as long as in the control (72 h). Similar results were
   obtained for exposures to Cd in FRAQ or FRAQ(NTA) media (0.01-0.9 mu
   mol.1(-1) free Cd2+), but additions of Cd to FRAQ(CIT) yielded anomalous
   growth curves (heightened sensitivity to Cd2+ at low Cd levels;
   shortened period of exponential growth at high Cd levels). Short-term (6
   min) intracellular uptake of radiolabelled Cd-109 was measured in the
   three media containing the same free Cd2+ concentration (0.25 mu
   mol.1(-1)). Uptake of cadmium was more than 2-fold higher in FRAQ(CIT)
   than in the other two media. Under the same conditions, the algae could
   be shown to accumulate citrate; the measured uptake rate (83 pmol
   citrate.m(-2).s(-1)) was about 4 times greater than that of Cd in the
   presence of citrate (21 pmol Cd.m(-2).s(-1)) - the citrate transporter
   would only have to be fooled once every four transport events to account
   for the enhanced cadmium uptake in the presence of citrate. Our results
   clearly show that the bioavailability of Cd and Zn diverges from the
   predictions of the Free-Ion Model in the presence of a low molecular
   weight metabolite such as citrate-accidental or piggy-back uptake of the
   metal-ligand complex across the biological membrane is a plausible
   explanation for this enhanced availability. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Toxic heavy metals, i.e. copper (If), lead (II) and cadmium (II), can be
   removed from water by metallurgical solid wastes, i.e. bauxite waste red
   muds and coal fly ashes acting as sorbents. These heavy-metal-loaded
   solid wastes mag then be solidified by adding cement to a durable
   concrete mass assuring their safe disposal. Thus, toxic metals in water
   have been removed by sorption on to inexpensive solid waste materials as
   a preliminary operation of ultimate fixation. Metal uptake (sorption)
   and release (desorption) have been investigated by thermostatic batch
   experiments. The distribution ratios of metals between the solid sorbent
   and aqueous solution have been found as a function of sorbent type,
   equilibrium aqueous concentration of metal and temperature. The
   breakthrough volumes of the heavy metal solutions have been measured by
   dynamic column experiments so as to determine the saturation capacities
   of the sorbents. The sorption data have been analysed and fitted to
   linearized adsorption isotherms. These observations are believed to
   constitute a database for the treatment of one industrial plant's
   effluent with the solid waste of another, and also to utilize
   unconventional sorbents, i.e. metallurgical solid wastes, as
   cost-effective substitutes in place of the classical hydrous-oxide-type
   sorbents such as alumina, silica and ferric oxides. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The acid-base properties of two samples of anthropogenic fulvic acids
   (FA) extracted from the untreated sewage sludge (rsFA) of a municipal
   wastewater treatment plant and from the compost (csFA) obtained in the
   aerobical digestion of this sludge were studied. Potentiometric
   titrimetry, infrared spectroscopy and synchronous molecular fluorescence
   (SyF) spectroscopy were used to obtain experimental information about
   the acid-base properties of the samples. Moreover, the SyF spectral data
   which were collected as function of the pH were analysed by a
   self-modelling curve resolution technique, evolving factor analysis with
   a gradient concentration window (EFA-GCW), to calculate the number of
   acid-base systems, their SyF spectra and the corresponding distribution
   diagrams, from which the pK(a) values were estimated. Two acid-base
   systems with pK(a) values about 6.2 and 8.9 were detected for rsFA and
   three systems with pK(a) values about 3.8, 6.6 and 9.4 for csFA. The
   amounts of acid groups directly titrated in water were (standard
   deviations in brackets) about 6.8(1) for rsFA and 6.73(3) for csFA. This
   information for rsFA and csFA was compared with similar information for
   natural soil FA samples extracted from a pinewood soil. Beyond different
   structural composition, this comparison showed that the anthropogenic
   samples have a higher amount of acid structures, but the structures of
   natural samples have stronger acid properties. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{River infiltration into a sand and gravel aquifer was investigated to
   assess the importance of dentrification in maintaining low-NO3-
   groundwater supplies. Samples from the River Elbe and groundwater
   sampling points along a section of the aquifer were analysed for
   dissolved organic carbon, major ions and the N-15/N-14 isotopic ratio of
   dissolved NO3-. Input of NO3- to the aquifer is influenced by seasonal,
   temperature-dependent denitrification in the river bed sediments. Along
   an upper flowpath in the aquifer from the River Elbe to a sampling point
   at a distance of 55 m, the median NO3- concentration decreased by 4.8 mg
   litre(-1) and the delta(15)N composition increased by + 9.0\%,
   consistent with denitrification. Similar isotopic enrichment was
   demonstrated in a laboratory column experiment with a reduction in NO3-
   of 10.5 mg litre(-1) for an increase in delta(15)N of + 9.8\%, yielding
   an isotopic enrichment factor of -14.6\%. A mass balance for
   denitrification shows that oxidizable organic carbon required for
   denitrification is derived from both the infiltrating river water and
   solid organic matter fixed in the river bed sediments and aquifer
   material. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was photolysed using a 1 kW photochemical
   reactor. The degradation of PCP (0.15 mM) was carried out using both
   direct UV photolysis and photolysis in the presence of H2O2 (3.0, 6.7,
   18.0 and 37.2 mM). The decay of PCP and the formation of photoproducts
   were followed by high performance liquid chromatography, ion
   chromatography and UV absorbance detection. The first-order rate
   constants k(1) for the decay of PCP were estimated under various
   conditions: for direct UV photolysis, k(1) = 0.115 min(-1); for
   photolysis in the presence of various concentrations of H2O2, the rate
   constant increased to a plateau (k(1) approximate to 0.7 min(-1)) at
   H2O2 concentrations greater than 6 mM. The correlation between
   photodegradation and toxicity was studied using a bacterial toxicity
   test and a 96 h Fathead Minnow toxicity test. In both cases. the
   toxicity decreased as the concentration of PCP or the total organic
   chlorine concentration fell. These results indicate that the W treatment
   of PCP either does not generate significant levels of acutely toxic
   intermediates, or any toxic intermediates are rapidly degraded under the
   specific conditions used in these studies. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Coke plant and coal gasification wastewater have similar
   characteristics. There are high concentrations of ammonia and organic
   compounds especially refractory and inhibitory organics in them. Coal is
   the main energy resource in China hence pollution caused by coke plant
   and coal gasification wastewater has been severe for decades. The
   anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A(1)-A(2)-O) fixed biofilm system was used for
   coke plant wastewater treatment in this study. The experimental results
   showed that this system was efficient and stable in NH3-N and COD
   reductions. The effluent NH3-N and COD were 3.1, 114 mg/l with removal
   efficiencies of 98.8 and 92.4\%, respectively, when the total HRT of the
   whole system was 31.6 hours. Microorganisms were enumerated and organic
   transformation in the system was analyzed by GC/MS equipment. Batch
   tests were also conducted and it was found that anaerobic treatment of
   coke plant wastewater differed from anoxic treatment. Biodegradable
   phenolics were removed at lower efficiencies while complicated and high
   molecular a eight organics were removed at higher efficiencies by
   anaerobic treatment in comparison with anoxic treatment. The
   biodegradability of anaerobic effluent was higher than that of anoxic

   current intensity was varied from 0 to 100 mA. A nitrate removal
   efficiency exceeding 98\% was achieved at a current of 20 mA when
   phosphate was used as a buffer. Current intensities between 20 to 25 mA
   resulted in the lowest effluent concentrations of nitrate, whereas,
   lower current intensities affected proportionately less nitrate
   reduction. Fnr higher current intensities, hydrogen inhibition and
   charge induced repulsion caused decreased reduction efficiencies. ORP
   was governed by both the concentrations of hydrogen and effluent
   nitrate. A total nitrate removal efficiency of 85\% was achieved at a
   current level of 25 mA in the absence of any nutrient. No appreciable
   change occurred in viable cell count in the effluent with time. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The adsorption of mercury, cadmium and lead from aqueous solutions on
   heat-treated and sulphurized activated carbon has been studied
   comparatively. The adsorption isotherms for the various metals were
   measured at 298 K, using adsorptive solutions at two pH values. The
   adsorption was much higher for mercury than for cadmium and lead for all
   adsorbents. The adsorption of mercury greatly increased for the samples
   of sulphurized carbon and also, though less, for the sample prepared in
   N-2. The decrease of pH in the adsorptive solution to pH 2.0 drastically
   reduced the adsorption of mercury. The effect of pH change on the
   adsorption of Cd2+ and Pb2+ occurred with less adsorbents than for
   mercury. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A stable anaerobic degradation of swine manure with ammonia
   concentration of 6 g-N/litre was obtained in continuously stirred tank
   reactors with a hydraulic retention time of 15 days, at Four different
   temperatures. Methane yields of 188, 141, 67 and 22 ml-CH4/g-VS were
   obtained at 37, 45, 55 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The yields were
   significantly lower than the potential biogas yield of the swine manure
   used (300 ml-CH4/g-VS). A free ammonia concentration of 1.1 g-N/litre or
   more was found to cause inhibition in batch cultures at pH 8.0 (reactor
   pH), and higher free ammonia concentrations resulted in a decreased
   apparent specific growth rate. Batch experiments with various mixtures
   of swine and cattle manure showed that the biogas process was inhibited
   when the swine-to-cattle manure ratio was higher than 25:75,
   corresponding to a free ammonia concentration of approximately 1.1
   g-N/litre. Inhibition of the biogas process and, thereby, a reduction of
   the methane yield followed a four-stage pattern: below a threshold of
   1.1 g-N/litre free ammonia, the process was uninhibited; over this
   concentration, inhibition occurred, forming first a phase with an
   initial inhibition, then a plateau and then an inhibition stage where
   the apparent specific growth rate decreased with increasing
   concentrations of free ammonia. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-18}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The effect of external carbon sources on metabolic properties of the
   denitrifying community in single-sludge systems with predenitrification
   was investigated. Sludge samples were collected from full-scale and
   pilot-scale experimental lines during microbial adaption to methanol and
   ethanol, respectively. Changes in functional properties were studied by
   measuring denitrification capacity with different electron donors in
   batch tests using the acetylene inhibition technique. Substrate-use
   profiles were analysed with principal component analysis. Adaptation to
   methanol was slow, and the capacity to denitrify with acetate decreased
   continuously. Short-chain fatty acids were less popular for denitrifiers
   in the methanol-adapted sludge than they were in the reference sludge,
   while the capacity to denitrify with methanol and ethanol was higher.
   Denitrification capacity with ethanol and acetate in the ethanol
   adapting sludge increased rapidly. The ethanol-adapted sludge also had a
   higher capacity to denitrify with butyrate, glycerol, and methanol.
   Neither methanol nor ethanol as external carbon affected denitrification
   capacity with aromatic compounds or glucose. A reduced ability to
   denitrify with a vast number of electron donors can be regarded as a
   negative characteristic, since it reflects a lower capacity to make use
   of substances in the sewage. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Thirty-five ground-water samples have been collected from wells, springs
   and drainage galleries on Mt Etna volcano for the determination of
   major, minor and trace elements in solution. Attention has been focused
   in particular on dissolved minor add trace elements, for most of which
   no data were available in the studied area. In general, dissolution of
   solids into Etna's ground waters follows from strong interaction between
   water of meteoric origin, CO2 gas of magmatic origin and the volcanic
   rocks of the aquifers. However, the R-mode analysis allowed to
   distinguish several sources of solutes: Al, Co, Ni, Fe, Si, As would
   derive mainly from alteration of the volcanic rocks of Etna; SO4=, K,
   Na, V, Sr, Mo, Cr and calculated p(CO2) would instead indicate a major
   contribution of volcanic gases (mostly CO2 and SO2); and TDS, HCO3=, Li
   Mg, B and Cl- would indicate a derivation from both these sources. Se,
   Hg, Cu and Mn would derive from hydrothermal fluids, and Ca would derive
   both from this latter contribution and from rock alteration. The
   comparison between trace elements abundance in Etna's ground waters and
   that in the ground waters of other areas of Italy showed that, in
   general, Etna's waters, like other volcanic ground waters, are enriched
   in Li, Mn, Si, V, As and Mo. Furthermore, in the areas of Mt Etna where
   the contribution of volcanic gas to the aquifers is greatest, ground
   waters are also enriched in B, Se, Co, Hg, Al, Fe and Ni. The obtained
   results show clearly that, in active volcanic areas, many dissolved
   elements can attain levels that can be appreciably different from those
   indicated by WHO for drinking water. Therefore, the local geological
   factors which can influence the geochemical behaviour of these elements
   in solution should be taken into account when establishing national
   standards for drinking-water quality. In consideration of the local
   natural background values, concentrations of dissolved elements that
   differ from the guideline values should be accepted in areas with
   peculiar geological characteristics, provided that the elements under
   consideration do not have a direct influence on health. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Macromolecular compounds such as proteins and polysaccharides can
   comprise a significant portion of dissolved organic carbon in
   wastewater, but limited information is available on how these compounds
   are degraded in biological wastewater treatment systems. Bacteria cannot
   assimilate intact macromolecules but must first hydrolyze them to
   monomers or small oligomers. Whether this hydrolysis occurs in contact
   with cells or by enzymes released into bulk solution is critical to an
   understanding of macromolecule metabolism. This study used the
   fluorescent model substrate analogs L-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin .
   HCl (Leu-MCA) and 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-glucoside (MUF-alpha-glc)
   to determine the location of leucine aminopeptidase and
   alpha-glucosidase activity in wastewater inoculated biofilm and
   suspended cultures and in trickling filter effluent. In biofilm
   cultures, no more than 3\% of total hydrolytic activity was located in
   the cell-free bulk solution. Similar results were obtained in suspended
   culture where 97\% of leucine aminopeptidase and 93\% of
   alpha-glucosidase activity occurred in contact with cells. In trickling
   filter effluent, hydrolysis was also predominantly cell-associated.
   Hydrolysis rates were at least five times higher in contact with cells
   and sloughed biofilm pieces than in cell-free solution. When considered
   with the results of other experiments demonstrating that hydrolytic
   fragments of proteins and polysaccharides accumulate in bulk solution
   during macromolecule degradation, these experiments support a
   generalized mechanism for macromolecule degradation that features
   cell-associated hydrolysis followed by the release of hydrolytic
   fragments back into bulk solution. This cell-associated hydrolysis and
   release is repeated until hydrolytic fragments are small enough to be
   assimilated by cells. Use of this macromolecule degradation mechanism
   can help refine wastewater treatment models so that they can more
   accurately predict the performance of bioreactors treating complex
   wastewaters. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A macroscopic partitioning model governed by microbial transformation
   was developed to elucidate the transport and fate of chlorinated
   hydrocarbons and microorganisms in porous media. Carbon tetrachloride
   (CT) and 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) were selected as the target
   compounds. A laboratory column experiment was also conducted to validate
   the accuracy of the model. Results obtained from the TOC concentration
   and microbial activities in effluent and pore water demonstrate that the
   steady state of the microbial growth was reached after an incubation
   period of 40 days. Microorganisms tended to accumulate in the first 20
   cm of the column and consumed auxiliary substrate rapidly to sustain the
   dechlorinating capabilities. Significant degradation of CT with the
   concomitant increase of chloroform, the daughter product of CT via
   dechlorination, was also demonstrated after 57 days. TCA is more
   recalcitrant than CT. Removal of 42\% of the original TCA input was
   demonstrated in 121 days. No 1,1-dichloroethane was detected. Model
   simulation results indicate that the predicted concentrations are all in
   the range close to the experimental data. A good correlation between the
   simulated and measured values demonstrates that the partitioning model
   can describe the transport and fate of chlorinated hydrocarbons and
   microorganisms In the contaminated groundwaters. The distribution
   coefficient between free-living and attached bacteria plays a prominent
   role in controlling the distribution pattern of microorganisms and the
   fate Of chlorinated hydrocarbons. In addition, the interaction between
   the supplemental substrate and the active microorganisms significantly
   influences the dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons. The valid and
   accurate transport model provides the basis for the accurate prediction
   of the transport and fate of chlorinated hydrocarbons as well as the
   proper selection of a remedial approach to eliminate contaminants in
   soil environments. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the pollution load generated internally from a reservoir
   on the effectiveness of an eutrophication control plan is significant
   and has gained increasing attention recently. Accurate estimation of the
   internal load is difficult because of its spatial and temporal
   variation. A procedure using a dynamic spatial modeling approach is
   proposed to improve the estimation. A case study of Posan off-stream
   reservoir is described to demonstrate the implementation of the
   procedure for data collection and model preparation, field sampling
   planning and investigation, laboratory analysis for phosphorus releasing
   rates, model integration of AGNPS and WASP, calibration and verification
   of the integrated model, and the internal load estimation. The procedure
   is expected to provide appropriate temporal and spatial phosphorus
   internal load estimation for an off-stream reservoir. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It is shown that using Mn(II) as a catalyst during ozonation of raw Ebro
   river (Spain) water allows reductions in the content of organic matter.
   Characterization of the raw and ozonated water at two different O-3:C
   weight basis ratios was made by concentrating the sample through
   liquid-liquid extraction or derivation with
   O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine hydrochloride
   (PF-BOA.HCl), along with the gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry
   (GC/MS) and electron capture detector (GC/ECD) techniques. A total of 88
   different organic compounds were identified, mainly carboxylic acids,
   aromatics, aldehydes, ketones and alcohols. The percentage of
   elimination or formation levels reached during ozonation are discussed.

Abstract = {{A method is presented that uses H+ production of the first nitrification
   step as an alternative to oxygen consumption to characterise activated
   sludge nitrification kinetics. The method consists of a titration
   in-sensor-experiment with nitrifying sludge combined with a parameter
   estimation procedure. Based on a cumulative base addition curve, it is
   possible to estimate the volumetric nitrification capacity of the mixed
   liquor (mu(A) X X-BA/Y-A, in (mg-N/litre)/h) and the Monod
   half-saturation coefficient K-NH for the Nitrosomonas bacteria in the
   sludge. It is shown with lab tests and on-line in-sensor-experiments on
   a pilot activated sludge plant for N removal that the proposed
   combination of a titration experiment and a parameter estimation
   procedure can also be used to estimate nitrifiable N concentrations
   present in a mixed liquor sample. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Groundwater contaminants including 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP),
   2,3,4,6-tetrachlorophenol (TeCP), and pentachlorophenol (PCP) were
   mineralized in three aerobic fluidized-bed reactors (FBRs) employing
   sand, volcanite, and diatomaceous earth as biomass carriers. The effect
   of temperature on chlorophenol degradation kinetics was studied in FBR
   batch tests at temperatures ranging from 4 to 16.5 degrees C. TCP and
   TeCP degradation was modeled using the Michaelis-Menten kinetics.
   Specific maximum degradation rates for TCP and TeCP varied with
   temperature from 0.46 x 10(-3) to 31 x 10(-3) mg mgVS(-1) h(-1) and K-s
   varied from zero to 7.1 mg l(-1). Degradation of PCP was affected by the
   presence of TCP and TeCP and followed competitive inhibition kinetics.
   Specific degradation rates for PCP degradation varied with temperature
   from 0.24 x 10(-3) to 1.7 x 10(-3) mg mgVS(-1) h(-1) and were always
   lower than for other chlorophenols. The Arrhenius equation described the
   temperature effects on biodegradation of chlorophenols. The activation
   energies (kJ mol(-1)) for TCP and TeCP varied from 126 to 194, and for
   PCP from 59 to 130. In the studied temperature range, a 10 degrees C
   decrease in temperature generally resulted in over seven times slower
   degradation rates. The volcanite reactor had the highest and the sand
   reactor the lowest biomass accumulation. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A characteristic of the biological phosphorus removal process is the
   interaction between different intracellular components. Therefore, an
   understanding of the effects of the intracellular components on
   biological phosphorus removal is essential for the practical application
   of the process. In this study, the stoichiometry of poly-hydroxybutyrate
   (PHB) to P-uptake and the kinetics of uptake of ortho-phosphate in
   relation to PHB were investigated under aerobic and substrate limiting
   conditions in batch experiments with activated sludge from a biological
   phosphorus removal process. The stoichiometry of PHB to P-uptake was
   investigated by determination of the degradation rate of PHB under
   aerobic conditions in the presence and absence of ortho-phosphate in the
   bulk liquid. The degradation of PHB as a function of time was described
   by a first-order equation. The presence of ortho-phosphate increased the
   rate of PHB degradation significantly, confirming that the uptake of
   ortho-phosphate directly required PHB. The fraction of PHB used for
   uptake of ortho-phosphate from the bulk liquid was estimated to be 30\%.
   Furthermore, batch experiments confirmed that the uptake rate of
   ortho-phosphate under aerobic conditions was highly dependent on the
   concentration of PHB in the biomass. The observed uptake rate of
   ortho-phosphate as a function of the PHB concentration was
   mathematically described by a Monod equation. The maximum uptake rate of
   the sludge was estimated to be 14 (mg-P/g-VSS)/h. The obtained results
   add to the understanding of the mechanisms of the biological phosphorus
   removal process under the stress conditions with limiting substrate
   supplies present in the full-scale wastewater treatment process.
   Furthermore, the results indicate that control strategies to stabilise
   the process should focus on a maintenance and optimal utilisation of
   PHB. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The freshwater coelenterate Hydra vulgaris is an important component of
   freshwater ecosystems, and this study aimed to establish its value as an
   indicator of pollutants entering freshwater. The toxicity of the heavy
   metals copper, cadmium and zinc was assessed using both acute lethal and
   sub-lethal responses. Techniques involving the identification and
   large-scale culture of Hydra were also examined. The acute lethal
   toxicity of copper, cadmium and zinc was measured by determining 24-h,
   48-h, 72-h and 96-h LC50 values and the sub-lethal effects assessed
   using a feeding test. The feeding test examined toxic effects on the
   normal responses of Hydra to the presence of the prey provided, neonate
   Daphnia magna (Strauss). Results of this study demonstrated that H.
   vulgaris (Pallas) is a suitable species for evaluating the toxicity of
   freshwater pollutants and can be used successfully to rank toxicants in
   order of potential hazard. It can be cultured easily in the laboratory
   to provide large numbers of test animals and can be used in simple,
   cost-effective bioassays of both acute and sub-acute toxicity. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Laboratory bench-scale experiments were conducted to elucidate the
   effect of ozone on the colloidal stability of particles coated with
   natural organic matter (NOM) derived from different sources. Four types
   of NOM (three surface water and one groundwater) were studied.
   Experiments were conducted in the absence and presence of calcium. The
   results revealed that flocculation benefits from ozonation are dependent
   on the specific NOM being studied. For some NOM sources, flocculation
   benefits can be attributed to a significant increase in association with
   calcium after ozonation. The magnitude of the increase in calcium
   association is dependent on the type of NOM being studied and its
   reactivity to ozonation. Calcium association with NOM can be expected to
   increase after ozonation only if ozone affects the number of functional
   groups that specifically complex calcium. The results also indicated
   that calcium-NOM association can be related to the oxygen content of
   NOM. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Samples of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) were obtained from landfill
   leachate-polluted groundwater at Vejen Landfill, Denmark. The humic
   acids, fulvic acids and the hydrophilic fraction were isolated and
   purified. Based on DOC measurements, the fulvic acid fraction
   predominated, accounting for about 60\% of the total amount of DOC with
   an apparent molecular weight of about 1800 Da. The hydrophilic fraction
   constituted about 30\% of the total amount of DOC with an apparent
   molecular weight of about 2100 Da, and the humic acid fraction made up
   about 10\% of the total amount of DOC with an apparent molecular weight
   of about 2600 Da. The elemental compositions of the humic acids, fulvic
   acids and the hydrophilic fraction were in the ranges typical for humic
   substances from other origins. The O/C ratios for humic acids, fulvic
   acids and the hydrophilic fraction were similar in the leachate-polluted
   groundwater. For humic acids the O/C ratios were slightly higher than
   reported in the literature, indicating a high content of carboxylic
   groups, phenolic groups or carbohydrates. Acid-base titration indicated
   that, in the fulvic acids and the hydrophilic fraction, carboxylic acids
   were the dominating functional group, representing about 6 meg g(-1).
   The weakly acidic groups in fulvic acids and the hydrophilic fraction
   represented about 1 and 3 meg g(-1), respectively. The total acidity in
   fulvic acids and the hydrophilic fraction accounted for 48-57\% of the
   O/C ratio. In the humic acids, carboxylic groups made up about 3 meg
   g-(-1) and the weakly acidic groups made up about 1.5 meg g(-1). The
   total acidity accounted for 29-32\% of the O/C ratio. The
   characterization of DOC in leachate-polluted groundwater in terms of
   humic acids, fulvic acids and hydrophilic fraction showed that the
   hydrophilic fraction resembles, in many ways, humic and fulvic acids;
   thus, a distinction between the fractions may be related to the methods
   only and be of little practical value. The three fractions constituting
   the DOC content in a sample should all be considered when evaluating
   processes such as metal complexation and transport of metals and
   hydrophobic, organic contaminants. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The high temperature, high pressure wet oxidation reaction of quinoline
   has been studied as a function of initial concentration, pH and
   temperature. At neutral to acidic pH, it is effective in the oxidation
   of quinoline at 240 degrees C and above, whereas under alkaline
   conditions the reaction is markedly slowed down. The results indicate
   that the reaction is an auto-catalysed, free radical chain reaction
   transforming 99\% of quinoline to other substances. Of the quinoline.
   30-50\% was oxidised to CO2 and H2O depending on the initial
   concentration. Wet oxidation of deuterium-labelled quinoline was used as
   a method for verifying and quantifying the reaction products. Fifteen
   reaction products were identified and quantitatively determined.
   accounting for 70\% of the carbon present after treatment, Nicotinic
   acid was a main product, accounting for up to 35\% of the parent
   substance, The formation of succinic acid is suggested to be a result of
   a coupling reaction of the acetic acid radical A reaction mechanism is
   suggested for the degradation of quinoline: it involves hydroxyl
   radicals and the possible interaction with autoclave walls is discussed.

Title = {{Application methods of pesticides to an aquatic mesocosm in order to
   simulate effects of spray drift}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{A treatment procedure was developed to mimic spray drift deposition of
   pesticides on the water surface of outdoor experimental ditches. The
   performance of this procedure was evaluated in two studies (using the
   pesticides chlorpyrifos and linuron, respectively) by testing the
   capability to apply pesticides to the ditches accurately, without
   contaminating adjacent control ditches. This was done by measuring the
   volume and concentration of the spray, by chemical analysis of the
   compounds in the ditch water and by measuring spray deposition on the
   water surface. After the first study some slight modifications were made
   to the treatment procedure. In the second study, in which eight ditches
   were treated with a fixed volume of spray of varying pesticide
   concentrations, it could be shown that the actual volumes dosed closely
   matched the intended volume (mean value per treatment within 1\% of
   intended value; coefficient of variation <2\%). Also, the measured
   concentrations of the pesticide in the water, as well as the
   concentrations calculated from spray deposition measurements, closely
   approximated the intended concentrations. It is concluded that using the
   newly developed treatment procedure, pesticides are applied to mesocosms
   in an accurate and reproducible manner without contaminating controls.
   This may be relevant, especially if mesocosm studies are carried Out for
   registration purposes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of solution chemistry (pH, ionic strength and calcium
   concentration) on the oxygen sensitivity of natural and synthetic
   dissolved organic macromolecule sorption by granular activated carbon
   was investigated. Sorption sensitivity to the presence of oxygen was
   found to decrease with decreasing pH, with increasing ionic strength and
   with increasing calcium concentration, The influence of oxygen on the
   extent of sorption by a basic GAC (pH(PZC) = 8.5) appears to be enhanced
   by increasing phenolic acidity and/or decreasing macromolecule size. The
   results suggest that open, flexible molecular configurations of organic
   macromolecules and the direct interactions of these substances with
   carbon surfaces are important factors with respect to the effects of
   oxygen on their sorption from aqueous phase. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A novel single-sludge process for achieving partial nitrification and
   complete denitrification (the PN/CD process) was tested at the
   bench-scale over a range of influent ratios of chemical oxygen demand
   (GOD) to total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). Mean ammonia nitrogen
   concentrations in PN/CD process effluent varied from 6.5 to 8.4 mg/liter
   at influent COD/TKN ratios varying from 3.7 to 9.8. Ammonia nitrogen
   concentrations in the influent wastewater had little effect on effluent
   ammonia levels. Bleed-through of COD to the effluent was not observed at
   influent filterable COD/ammonia-N ratios between 2 and 11.
   Denitrification was nearly complete (mean effluent nitrate plus nitrite
   N less than or equal to 1.4 mg/liter) at influent COD/TKN ratios of 5.3
   or greater, whereas nitrate and nitrite accumulation occurred at ratios
   less than 5.1. The denitrification performance of the pre-anoxic reactor
   of the PN/CD process was consistent with that of other
   pre-denitrification processes when compared in terms of relative input
   rates of COD and oxidized nitrogen. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The extraction of chromium (VI) from aqueous solutions of 0.1 M ionic
   strength by trioctylmethylammonium compounds (Aliquat 336) in a mixture
   of kerosene and xylene was investigated. The results indicate that the
   extraction efficiency of Cr(Vr) in acidic aqueous solution is good. In
   these experiments, the relative affinities of different anions to
   Aliquat 336 were in the order of NO3- > Cl- > SO4-2. Experimental
   results showed that hydrogen chromate ion (HCrO4-) is the major
   extractable species of Cr(VI) at pH 3.53-3.75, expressed by the
   mechanism <(R3CH3NNO3)over bar> + HCrO4- = <(R3CH3NHCrO4)over bar> +
   NO3-. The equilibrium constant for the reaction is 10(2078) (at 25
   degrees C), A computer program has been developed to simulate Cr(VI)
   extraction results under various conditional the results of which fit
   the experimental data very well. The strippant is composed of 0.1 M
   sodium hydroxide and 1.0 M, sodium chloride and completely strips Cr(VI)
   from the loaded solvent ({[}Cr] = 0.0092 M, A/O = 0.5). Thus, the
   recovered solution, by reducing the A/O ratio, contains a
   10-times-higher concentration of Cr(VI). The stripped solvent (Aliquat
   336) can then be reused for extracting Cr(VI). After five extraction
   cycles, the Aliquat-336/kerosene/xylenexylene solution shows no
   significant loss in volume and retains the same extracting ability. (C)

Abstract = {{Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) is a floating aquatic plant which
   has been employed for wastewater treatment in many parts of the world.
   By planting water hyacinth in a wastewater pond, part of the gaseous
   oxygen produced by photosynthetic activity Of the green leaves is
   translocated to the stems and roots and to the water body; this oxygen
   is used by the aerobic and facultative bacteria in biodegrading organic
   matter contained in the wastewater. Two groups of bacteria normally
   exists in a water hyacinth pond (WHP), namely the suspended bacteria
   which are present in the liquid portion and the biofilm bacteria which
   are attached on the surfaces of the roots of the water hyacinth plants
   and on the side walls and bottom layers of the pond itself. Current
   design criteria for WHPs do not emphasize the roles of these two groups
   of bacteria, but they are based on either empirical relationships or
   first-order reaction rate and complete-mix how condition. This study
   attempts to show the significance of both the suspended and biofilm
   bacteria and the flow hydraulics (based on dispersion number) in the
   reduction of organic matter in the WHP system. Kinetic coefficient of
   the suspended bacteria was calculated from a first-order reaction rate
   including the effect of organic loading rate. For the biofilm bacteria,
   the reaction rate was also first-order and based on the substrate flux
   into the biofilm. The integrated kinetic model proposed for the WHP
   incorporates the activities of both the suspended and biofilm bacteria
   and the hydraulic dispersion number. The model was found to be
   satisfactory in predicting biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) removal in a
   full-scale WHP treating an anaerobic pond effluent. Design guidelines
   and an operating strategy to achieve improvement in BOD removal
   efficiency in WHP are given. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Composition, concentration and size distribution of the particulate
   phase in saline groundwater from the Laxemar borehole, Sweden, were
   measured at three different sampling sections sealed off by rubber
   packers (315.0-321.5, 1090.0-1096.3 and 1420.0-1705.0 m). Concentration
   and size distribution analysis were performed on-line in a field
   laboratory using measurements of light scattering in combination with
   photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS). Estimates of the chemical
   composition of the solid phase were obtained from scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) coupled to energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and
   saturation calculations were made with the geochemical code PHREEQE,
   based on hydrochemical analysis. The results indicate that the
   particulate phase consisted of aluminosilicates, SiO2, CaF, and probably
   CaCO3. The concentration of particulates varied between the different
   depths with the lowest content at the 1090.0-1096.3 m level, where it
   was estimated to be <0.5 mg/litre, Estimated concentration range in the
   315.0-321.5 m section was 0.5-0.7 mg/litre (depending on the assumed
   mineral composition), while the highest concentrations were found in the
   samples from the deepest level (concentration range 1.4-3.0 mg/litre).
   The average diameters increased with increasing depth, (540, 640 and
   1840 nm at the depths 315.0-321.5, 1090.0-1096.3 and 1420.0-1705.0 m,
   respectively) which probably was related to the increasing salinity and
   corresponding increase in the Ca concentration. The study clearly
   illustrates that limiting the change; in the activities of CO2 and O-2
   during sampling and measurements are of utmost importance in order not
   to disturb the solid phase in terms of composition, concentration and
   size distribution. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   ranging from 3 to 11.8 toxic units. In contrast, in the oxidizing system
   (Eh similar to 500 mV, pH < 3.0), Zn, Cd, Cr, Ni and Pb were mobilized
   on days 7-15, corresponding to a drastic increase in toxicity (357 toxic
   units). These data indicate that laboratory oxygenation of highly acid
   productive field-collected sediments causes increased metal mobilization
   and toxicity, suggesting that similar responses may occur in the field
   after dredging activities or natural resuspension of sediments. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{It has been reported that deterioration of biological phosphorus removal
   (BPR) efficiency at some wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) regularly
   occurred after heavy rainfall or weekends, The deterioration has been
   attributed to low plant loading that took place during such events.
   However, it is hypothesized in this study that the cause of such
   deterioration may have been the excessive aeration that Look place at
   some of those plants due to inadequate control of aeration system during
   weekends and rainfall periods. In order to prove this hypothesis. the
   influence of excessive aeration (aeration during starvation conditions)
   on BPR processes was studied using a laboratory
   anaerobic-aerobic-settling sequencing hatch reactor (SBR). It was
   clearly demonstrated that the phosphorus uptake stops due to a gradual
   depletion of poly-hydroxy-butyrate (PHB) in an over-aerated process. If
   organic substrate is introduced to the system, phosphorus release is
   immediately at its maximal rate. However, the released phosphorus cannot
   be taken-up fully again because the PHB content limits the uptake rate.
   Consequently, incomplete phosphorus uptake leads to temporary. reduction
   of BPR efficiency. This causal effect can explain the deterioration of
   BPR efficiency after heavy rainfall or weekends. Since excessive
   aeration clearly negatively affects the BPR processes, the aeration
   should be properly controlled at sewage treatment plants. Some other
   findings of this study deserve to be mentioned.
   It was confirmed that the presence of acetate under aerobic conditions
   provokes phosphorus release. This may also contribute to deterioration
   of the BPR efficiency,
   The aerobic phosphate uptake was found to depend not only on the PHB but
   also on polyphosphate (poly-P) content of the cells.
   A maximal poly-P (0.18 g-P g-VSS) and minimal PHB content of the cells
   (2.11 mg-COD/g-VSS) were observed in the enriched sludge during
   excessive aeration experiments.
   It was shown that, under aerobic starvation conditions, glycogen can not
   replace PHB for phosphate uptake and is only used for maintenance.
   During this period, no oxygen consumption due to decay processes has
   been observed. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anaerobic degradation of formaldehyde With glucose and wood-glue
   wastewater was studied in batch cultures. Under test conditions the
   toxicity of formaldehyde to anaerobic degradation was dependent on the
   concentration of formaldehyde, the compounds of the wastewater and test
   time. The 50\% inhibition concentration was about 300 mg litre(-1) for
   tests with glucose and about 150 mg litre(-1) for tests with wood-glue
   wastewater. The inhibition under the critical concentration changed with
   the test time. The removal of formaldehyde was inhibited only with
   relatively high formaldehyde concentrations in comparison to
   gasification and GOD. Under 200 mg litre(-1) (tests with glue
   wastewater) or 400 mg litre(-1) (tests with glucose), more than 90\%
   formaldehyde was degraded. The strong inhibition of formaldehyde removal
   took place after the corresponding formaldehyde biomass load was more
   than 63 mg-F g(-1) OTS (tests with glue wastewater) or 126 mg-F g(-1)
   OTS (tests with glucose). Moreover, it was observed that the VFA were
   very low, when the formaldehyde concentration was over 200 mg litre(-1).

Abstract = {{A coastal water disposal site for municipal wastewater sludge was
   established in the southeastern waters of Hong Kong in 1991. Although
   the assimilating capacity of such a disposal site was expected to be
   high, some accumulation of dumped sewage sludge on the nearby bottom
   sediments was considered inevitable. In this study, sedimentary fecal
   stanols and sterols, such as coprostanol (5 beta(H)-cholestan-3
   beta-ol), cholestanol (5 alpha(H)-cholestan-3 beta-ol) and cholesterol,
   were chosen as molecular markers for the tracing of deposited sewage
   contaminants in the vicinity of the disposal site. Sediment samples from
   eleven locations ranging from the centre of the disposal site to up to
   20 km from the site were sampled in 1994. All sediment samples were
   shown to contain the molecular markers, with concentration ranges as
   follows (in mu g/g of dry sediment): coprostanol 0.34-5.09; cholestanol
   0.65-3.87; cholesterol 0.64-3.92. The fecal stanol/sterol ratio 5
   beta/(5 alpha + cholesterol) was found to be a suitable parameter for
   the comparison of sewage contamination in sediments. Non-parametric
   Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keuls pairwise multiple
   comparison analyses revealed that stations in the northeast and
   southwest of the disposal site were more polluted. Such anisotropic
   distribution of sewage markers was consistent with the directions of
   currents flowing through the disposal site. A mass balance model was
   developed to provide rough estimation of the sewage sludge loading in
   the sediments from the observed stanol/sterol ratio. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The performance of the trophic diatom index (TDI), a new index of
   trophic status in rivers, was evaluated at sites above and below major
   sewage works where nutrient removal is being considered. Some
   modifications to the index are proposed as a result. These include
   changing the scale from I (low nutrients) to 5 (high nutrients) to
   0-100, the removal of taxa that are predominately planktonic from the
   index, and some minor adjustments to taxa sensitivities and indicator
   values. More detailed guidelines on the choice of sample site are also
   proposed. In particular, it is important that sites in the ``recovery
   zone{''} downstream of sewage works are chosen so that the influence of
   the gross effects of organic pollution on the index is minimised. A
   ``look-up{''} chart to aid data interpretation is also described, The
   revised TDI is now recommended to regulatory organisations as a tool for
   assessing eutrophication in rivers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Biofilm development on stainless steel in mains water has been poorly
   documented to date. Results are presented of the development of
   potable-water biofilms over 12 months on stainless-steel grades 304 and
   316, used as appendages to a large building's plumbing distribution
   system. The viable cell counts on grade 304 pipe after 12 months
   averaged 2.8 x 10(3) cfu cm(-2), compared to 3.6 x 10(2) cfu cm(-2) on
   grade 316 pipe. The viable cell and total cell count on matt (2D)
   stainless steel remained significantly higher (p < 0.05) when compared
   to smooth (2B) stainless steel after 4-months and 8-months biofilm
   development, but at month 12 the viable cell counts on the two steel
   finishes were not significantly different. Total carbohydrate levels and
   biomass dry weight levels were slightly but not significantly higher on
   grade 304 than on grade 316. A mixture of biofilm bacteria attached to
   stainless steel were evident, including Pseudomonas spp.,
   Methylobacterium spp., Acinetobacter spp., Corynebacterium/Arthrobacter
   spp. and Micrococcus spp. Inductively coupled plasma spectrophotometer
   analysis of biofilms showed an accumulation of metal ions in both grades
   304 and 316 pipe biofilms. Molybdenum (0.04 mg litre(-1)) was found to
   be associated with biofilms isolated from grade 316 after 4 months, and
   0.05 mg litre(-1) was found in the biofilms after 12-months exposure to
   mains water. Scanning electron microscopy provided evidence of
   microcolony formation of rod-shaped and coccoid-shaped bacteria and
   diatoms. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biological treatment of a synthetic leachate containing cyanide was
   accomplished in a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR). A mixed
   culture of organisms growing on silicone tubing were provided with
   cyanide as a sole carbon and nitrogen source. Organisms consumed cyanide
   (20 mg/liter CNWAD-) and produced ammonia in an approximate 1:1 molar
   yield. The SBBR was operated on a 24-h cycle. Over the course of each
   cycle, 20 mg/liter of cyanide was degraded to below 0.5 mg/liter.
   Results from four track studies are presented. It was demonstrated that.
   when supplied with glucose, the organisms would readily consume excess
   ammonia, For each mole of glucose added, 10 moles of NH3-N were removed
   from solution. The SBBR can be used as a mobile system for treatment of
   leachate from gold-mining operations, Large volumes of low concentration
   wastewater can be treated in the SEER since it is not necessary to
   maintain a consortium of settling organisms. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science
