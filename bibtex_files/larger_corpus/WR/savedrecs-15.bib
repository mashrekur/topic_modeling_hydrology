Abstract = {{The primary interest of this work was to determine the processing
   conditions which will provide the most water removal from the
   precipitate after freezing and thawing. The work examined the effect of
   variables such as freezing time, freezing temperature, and pre-treatment
   steps, e.g. agitation or concentration, on the freeze thaw process of
   ferric precipitates. The extent of dewatering of freeze thawed samples
   was not significantly affected by freezing rate or curing time, provided
   the floe was completely frozen. However, a pre-concentration step was
   found to produce a more concentrated residual. The relatively low degree
   of structure within the ferric floes makes them particularly suitable
   for freeze-thaw conditioning. Only a slight increase in leach out of
   contaminant from the floe was observed. Thus, the experiments indicate
   that this is a very simple and effective method of dewatering
   precipitates, which does not require the use of additional additives.

Abstract = {{Ozone has been used as a pre-oxidation step for the treatment of
   stabilized leachates. Given the refractory nature of this type of
   effluents, the conversion of some wastewater quality parameters has been
   moderate after I h of ozonation (i.e. 30\% chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   depletion). Ozone uptake was calculated in the interval 1.3-1.5 g of
   ozone per gram of COD degraded. An optimum dose of ozone has been
   experienced in terms of biodegradability of the processed effluent (60
   min of treatment, I X 10(-3) mol L-1 ozone inlet feeding concentration
   and 50 L h(-1) gas flow-rate). pH and other typical hydroxyl radical
   generator systems exerted no influence on the efficiency of the process,
   suggesting the negligible role played by the indirect route of oxidation
   (generation of hydroxyl radicals). The ozonated effluent was thereafter
   treated in a second adsorption stage by using a commercial activated
   carbon. Removal levels up to 90\% of COD in approximately 120 It were
   experienced for adsorbent dosages of 30 g L-1. Both steps, the single
   ozonation and the adsorption stage have been modelled by using different
   pseudoempirical models. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The uptake of the seven heavy metal ions Cd(II), Co(H), Cr(III), Cu(II),
   Ni(II), Pb(11), and Zn(II) by sludge particulates in single-metal
   systems was investigated. Results showed that under acidic and neutral
   pH conditions, the uptake of all heavy metals by sludge particulates
   increases with the increase of pH. However, in the alkaline pH region,
   the uptake of Cu(II), Ni(II), and Co(II) decreases with the increase of
   pH, primarily due to the high dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   concentration in high pH conditions. Based on chemical reactions among
   heavy metal, sludge solids, and DOM, a mathematical model describing
   metal uptake as functions of DOM and pH was developed. The stability
   constants of metal-sludge and metal-DOM complexes can be determined
   using this model in conjunction with experimental metal uptake data.
   Results showed that, for the secondary sludge sample collected from
   Baltimore Back River Wastewater Treatment plant on March 1997, the
   stability constants of Cu(II)-sludge complex (log K-S) and Cu(II)-DOM
   complex (log K-L) are 5.3+/-0.2 and 4.7+/-0.3, respectively; for Ni(II),
   they are 4.0+/-0.2 and 3.9+/-0.2, respectively. Results also showed that
   under neutral and low pH conditions (pH < 8), the DOM effects on metal
   uptake for all heavy metals are insignificant. Therefore, the DOM term
   in the model can be ignored. Results showed that, for the secondary
   sludge sample collected from Baltimore Back River Wastewater Treatment
   plant on December 1996, the estimated log K-S values of metal sludge
   complexes for Cd(II), Co(II), Cr(III), Cu(H), Ni(II), Pb(H), and Zn(II)
   are, respectively, 3.6 +/- 0.2, 3.0 +/- 0.1, 5.5 +/- 0.1, 4.8 +/- 0.1,

Abstract = {{The availability of multiple carbon/energy sources, as is common in
   wastewater treatment plants, often enhances the biodegradation of
   recalcitrant compounds. In this paper, we classify and model different
   modes of multiple substrate utilization in a systematic way, using the
   concept of synthesizing unit. According to this concept, substrates can
   be substitutable or complementary; their uptake (or processing) can be
   sequential or parallel. We show how the different modes of multiple
   substrate interaction can be described by a single general model. From
   the general model, we derive simple expressions for co-metabolism of
   substrates that are not structurally analogous. Both the general and the
   specific co-metabolism model have the advantage that they can be used in
   combination with any microbial growth model. To test the co-metabolism
   model's realism, we confront it with experimental data. The results
   attained with the co-metabolism model support that the general model
   constitutes a useful framework for modeling aspects of multiple
   substrate utilization. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption behaviour of natural (clinoptilolite) and synthetic (NaP1)
   zeolites has been studied with respect to Cr(Ill), Ni(II), Zn(II),
   Cu(II) and Cd(II) in order to consider its application to purify metal
   finishing waste waters. The batch method has been employed using metal
   concentrations in solution ranged from 10 to 200 mg/l and solid/liquid
   ratios ranged from 2.5 to 10 g/1. The Langmuir model was found to
   describe well all sorption processes, allowing to establish metal
   sorption sequences from which the main retention mechanism involved for
   each metal has been inferred. Synthetic zeolite exhibited about 10 times
   greater sorption capacities (b(Cr) = 0.838 mmol/g, b(Ni) = 0.342 mmol/g,
   b(Zn) = 0.499 mmol/g, b(Cu) = 0.795 mmol/g, b(Cd) = 0.452 mmol/g) than
   natural zeolite (b(Cr) = 0.079 mmol/g, b(Ni) = 0.034 mmol/g, b(Zn) =
   0.053 mmol/g, b(Cu) = 0.093 mmol/g, b(Cd) = 0.041 mmol/g), appearing,
   therefore, as most suitable to perform metal waste water purification
   processes. This mineral showed the same high sorption capacity values
   when used in the purification of metal electroplating waste waters. (C)

Title = {{Pore blockage effect of NOM on atrazine adsorption kinetics of PAC: the

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) in natural water has been found to have
   negative effects on the adsorption of various trace organic compounds by
   activated carbon through two major mechanisms: direct competition for
   sites and pore blockage. In this study, the pore blockage effect of NOM
   on atrazine adsorption kinetics was investigated. Two types of powdered
   activated carbon (PAC) and three natural waters were tested to determine
   the roles of PAC pore size distribution and NOM molecular weight
   distribution in the pore blockage mechanism. When PAC was preloaded with
   natural water, the pore blockage effect of the NOM was found to cause a
   reduction of up to more than two orders of magnitude in the surface
   diffusion rate of atrazine compared to simultaneous adsorption of
   atrazine and NOM with fresh PAC. The surface diffusion coefficient of
   atrazine for preloaded PAC decreased with a decrease in PAC dose or an
   increase in NOM surface concentration. Because of the pore blockage
   effect of NOM, a 30\% drop in atrazine removal was observed in a
   continuous flow PAC/microtiltration (MF) system after 7 days of contact
   compared to the removal predicted from the batch isotherm test. Large
   micropores and mesopores were found to play an important role in
   alleviating the effect of pore blockage. A PAC with a relatively large
   fraction of large micropore and mesopores was shown to suffer much less
   from the pore blockage effect compared with a PAC that had a much
   smaller fraction of large pores. Natural waters with different NOM
   molecular weight distribution caused different extent of pore blockage.
   The NOM molecules with molecular weight between 200 and 700 Dalton
   appeared to be responsible for the pore blockage effect. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Currently, very little is known about the normal dynamics of microbial
   populations in wastewater treatment systems and the relationship between
   population dynamics and functional stability of treatment systems. We
   monitored the bacterial community in an oxygen activated sludge system
   at a pulp and paper mill during a 55-day period that included normal
   operation as well as an 11-day shutdown of the system and the subsequent
   start-up. Ribosomal intergenic spacer (RIS) length polymorphism
   fingerprints were very similar (57-88\% similar) throughout the study
   period. Analysis of clone libraries of RIS-rRNA gene amplicons indicated
   that Proteobacteria affiliated with the genera Paracraurococcus and
   Acidovorax as well as a Green Nonsulfur Bacterium affiliated with the
   genus Roseiflexus were consistently among predominant members of the
   community. By comparison, wastewater treatment systems from different
   pulp mills yielded dissimilar fingerprints (9-17\% similar), and their
   clone libraries had distinct predominant phylotypes. Our analysis
   strongly suggests that the composition of the bacterial community in the
   former treatment system was stable during normal operation as well as
   the shutdown and start-up. This stability coincided with functional
   stability, including consistent and nearly complete removal of
   biological oxygen demand. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The industrial solvent tetrachloroethylene (PCE) is among the most
   ubiquitous chlorinated compounds found in groundwater contamination. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the (1) feasibility of enhancing
   PCE biodegradation using cane molasses and sludge cakes as the primary
   substrates under methanogenic and iron reducing conditions, and (2)
   potential of installation a sludge cake/cane molasses biobarrier to
   clean up PCE-contaminated aquifers. The biodegradability of sludge cake
   (from secondary wastewater treatment system) and cane molasses was
   tested using bioavailability experiments. Results show that
   biodegradable materials were released from sludge cake/cane molasses and
   utilized by microbial consortia. Based on the chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) tests, approximately 28 and 248 mg of biodegradable COD can be
   released from I g of sludge cake and I g of cane molasses under
   anaerobic conditions, which have the potential to convert 70 and 620 mg
   of PCE to ethylene (ETH), respectively. Reductive dechlorination was
   evaluated using microcosms containing primary substrates (sludge
   cake/cane molasses) and inocula (aquifer sediments). Results indicate
   that sludge cake and cane molasses can serve as the diffusion sources of
   primary substrates, and enhance the reductive dechlorination of PCE
   under methanogenic processes. However, results from this study were not
   sufficient enough to show that reductive dechlorination of PCE would
   occur under iron-reducing conditions. This indicates that more studies
   need to be performed to further evaluate the role of iron reduction on
   the PCE dechlorination. Results reveal that it is feasible and
   applicable to install a sludge cake or cane molasses biobarrier to clean
   up PCE contaminated aquifers. From an engineering point of view, the
   sludge cake/cane molasses biobarrier has the potential to become an
   environmentally and economically acceptable technology for PCE
   bioremediation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A study on olive mill residues (OMR) as copper adsorbing material is
   reported in this work. A rough characterization of this waste material
   has been performed, by microanalysis and SEM pictures. Sorption tests
   with suspended OMR evidenced copper removal from solution, of about 60\%
   in the investigated experimental conditions. The COD release in solution
   was also monitored during biosorption. Considering that it was
   significant, OMR washings with water were performed before biosorption.
   In this case the COD release in solution was reduced to less than 600
   mg/L after two washings, while the OMR metal sorption properties did not
   change. Regenerated residues by acid solutions gave a copper removal of
   about 40\%, in the same experimental conditions of the first adsorption
   test: regeneration with EDTA at different concentrations suggested that
   it presents a damage of adsorption active sites. On the other hand, the
   use of HCl and CaCl2 led to completely regenerate the biosorbent
   material. Tests were also performed with a column filled with 80 g of
   OMR and the breakpoint was demonstrated to take place after that about I
   L solution was treated in the investigated experimental conditions.
   Regeneration tests permitted to demonstrate that a concentration factor
   of about 2 can be obtained in no-optimized conditions, highlighting the
   possibility of using OMR for the treatment of metal bearing effluents.
   The main advantage of the process would be the ``low cost{''} biosorbing
   material, considering that it represents a waste in the olive oil
   production. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of lead from drinking water was investigated to develop a
   point-of-use water filter that could meet the regulation imposed by the
   new European Directive 98-83 lowering lead concentration in drinking
   water below 10 mug L-1. The objective of this research was to assess the
   potential of different adsorbents (zeolites, resins, activated carbon,
   manganese oxides, cellulose powder) to remove lead from tap water with a
   very short contact time. To begin, the repartition of the lead species
   in a tap water and a mineral water was computed with the computer model
   CHESS. It showed that in bicarbonated waters lead is mainly under lead
   carbonate form, either in the aqueous or in the mineral phase. Batch
   experiments were then conducted to measure the equilibrium adsorption
   isotherms of the adsorbents. Then, for five of them, dynamic experiments
   in micro-columns were carried out to assess the outlet lead
   concentration level. Three adsorbents gave rise to a leakage
   concentration lower than 10 mug L-1 and were then selected for
   prototypes experiments: chabasite, an activated carbon coated with a
   synthetic zeolite and a natural manganese oxide. The proposed method
   clearly showed that the measurement of equilibrium isotherms is not
   sufficient to predict the effectiveness of an adsorbent, and must be
   coupled with dynamic experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   wide range of reaction conditions was studied at 30degreesC. The metal
   ion removal from the spent biomass was also measured. The batch
   experiments show that pH 4.5-5.5 was the best range for the sorption of
   the metal ions for untreated and acid-treated biomass. Time-dependent
   experiments for the metal ions showed that for the two metals examined,
   binding to the cassava waste biomass was rapid and occurred within 30
   min and completed within I It. High sorption capacities were observed
   for the two metals. The binding capacity experiments revealed the
   following amounts of metal ions bound per gram of biomass: 86.68 mg/g
   Cd, 55.82 mg/g Zn and 647.48 mg/g Cd, 559.74 mg/g Zn for untreated and
   acid-treated biomass, respectively. It was further found that the rate
   of sorption was particle-diffusion controlled, and the sorption rate
   coefficients were determined to be 2.30 x 10(-1) min(-1) (Cd2+), 4.0 x
   10(-3) min(-1) (Zn2+) and 1.09 x 10(-1) min(-1) (Cd2+), 3.67 x 10(-2)
   min(-1) (Zn2+) for 0.5 and 1.00 M differential acid treatment,
   respectively. Desorption studies showed that acid treatment inhibited
   effective recovery of metal ions already bound to the biomass as a
   result of stronger sulfhydryl-metal bonds formed. Less than 25\% of both
   metals were desorbed as concentration of acid treating reagent
   increases. However, over 60\% Cd and 40\% Zn were recovered from
   untreated biomass during the desorption study. The results from these
   studies indicated that both untreated and acid-treated cassava waste
   biomass could be employed in the removal of toxic and valuable metals
   from industrial effluents. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hydroxyl (OH) radical is proposed as an important factor in the
   ozonation of water. In the present study, the enhancing effect of
   3-chlorophenol on OH radical generation was mathematically evaluated
   using electron spin resonance (ESR)/spin- trapping technique. OH radical
   was trapped with a 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as a stable
   adduct, DMPO-OH. The initial velocity of DMPO-OH generation in ozonated
   water containing 3-chlorophenol was quantitatively measured using a
   combined system of ESR spectroscopy with stopped-flow apparatus which
   was controlled by home-made software. The initial velocity of DMPO-OH
   generation increased as a function of the concentration of ozone and the
   more effectively of 3-chlorophenol concentration. The relation among
   ozone concentration, amount of 3-chlorophenol and the initial velocity
   (nu(0)) of DMPO-OH generation was mathematically analyzed and the
   following equation was obtained, nu(0) (10(-6)M/S) = \{9.7 x
   {[}3-chlorophenol (10(-9) M)]+0.0005\}exp(57 x {[}ozone (10(-9)M)]). The
   equation fitted very well with the experimental results, and the
   correlation coefficient was larger than 0.99. The equation for the
   enhancing effect by 3-chlorophenol should provide useful information to
   optimize the condition in ozone treatment process of water containing
   phenolic pollutants. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Adsorption kinetics of fluoride on low cost materials}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{20}},
Pages = {{4929-4937}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption is one important technique in fluoride removal from aqueous
   solutions. The viability of adsorption techniques is greatly dependent
   on the development of adsorptive materials. A large number of materials
   have been tested at a fluoride concentration greater than 2 mg/l, and
   the lowest limit for fluoride reduction by them is about 2 mg/l.
   Decreasing the fluoride concentration to less than 2 mg/l, most of the
   tested materials displayed a very low capacity of fluoride removal.
   This paper has concentrated on investigating the adsorption kinetics and
   adsorption capacity of low cost materials at a low initial fluoride
   concentration. The experiments were carried out at a natural pH, and
   radioisotope F-18 rather than F-19 was used since F-18 can be rapidly
   measured by measuring the radioactivity with a resolution of 1 x 10(-13)
   Mg Or 0.01 muCi. The tested materials are hydroxyapatite, fluorspar,
   calcite, quartz and quartz activated by ferric ions. Their adsorption
   capacities follow the order:
   Hydroxyapatite > Fluorspar > Quartz activated using ferric ions >
   Calcite > Quartz
   The uptake of fluoride on hydroxyapatite is an ion-exchange procedure
   and follows the pseudo-first- and second-order equations, while the
   uptake of fluoride on the others is a surface adsorption and follows the
   pseudo-second-order equation. Calcite has been seen as a good adsorbent
   in fluoride removal and has been patented. However, our data suggested
   that its adsorption capacity is only better than quartz.
   The external mass transfer is a very slow and rate-determining step
   during fluoride removal from the aqueous solution. Under static
   conditions, there was no relative movement between adsorbents and
   solutions, the fluoride uptake was at a very slow rate and the adsorbent
   properties did not significantly affect the fluoride uptake. Under
   shaken conditions, the adsorption of fluoride was controlled by the
   adsorbent structure and chemical properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Brown coal fly ashes were tested as potentially low-cost sorbents for
   the removal of synthetic dyes from waters. It was shown that both basic
   (cationic) as well as acid (anionic) dyes can be sorbed onto the fly
   ash. The adsorption can be described by the multi-site Langmuir
   isotherm. The sorption capacities were in the range of 10(-1)10(-3)
   mmol/g and did not differ significantly for basic and acid dyes. The dye
   sorption decreased in the presence of organic solvents (methanol,
   acetone). The presence of oppositely charged surfactants exhibited a
   pronounced effect on the dye sorption-low concentrations of the
   surfactant enhanced sorption, whereas high concentrations solubilized
   the dyes and kept them in solution. Inorganic salts exhibited only a
   minor effect on the dye sorption. The sorption of basic dyes increased
   at high pH values, whereas the opposite was true for acid dyes. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Cellulose and orange waste were chemically modified by means of
   phosphorylation. The chemically modified gels were further loaded with
   iron(III) in order to create a suitable chelating environment for
   arsenate and arsenite removal. The loading capacity for iron(III) on the
   gel prepared from orange waste (POW) was 1.21 mmol g(-1) compared with
   0.96 mmol g(-1) for the gel prepared from cellulose (PC). Removal tests
   of arsenic with the iron(Ill)-loaded gel were carried out batchwise and
   by using a column. Arsenite removal was favored under alkaline condition
   for both PC and POW gels, however, the POW gel showed some removal
   capability even at neutral pH. On contrary, arsenate removal took place
   under acidic conditions at pH = 2-3 and 2-6 for the PC and POW gels,
   respectively. Since iron(III) loading is higher on the POW gel than on
   the PC gel greater arsenic removal has been achieved by the POW gel
   compared with the PC gel. It can be concluded that the POW gel can be
   used for the removal and recovery of both arsenite and arsenate from
   arsenic contaminated wastewater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The degradation of tropaeolin by iron was studied under oxidizing and
   inert atmospheres. The products were identified by various
   chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. Under inert atmosphere, the
   proposed model of mechanism is based on the adsorption of tropaeolin by
   the sulfonate function on the solid iron, followed by a reduction of the
   -N = N- bond with formation of 1-amino-2-naphthol and sulfanific acid.
   These two intermediaries were reduced to 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene and
   benzene with NH4+ and HSO3- liberation. Under oxidizing atmosphere,
   besides the reductions of tropaeolin, water and ferric ions, the
   existence of a homogeneous degradation was found. This process was
   explained (on the basis of surface iron potential monitoring) by a
   stepwise reduction of oxygen giving hydrogen peroxide. The initial
   stages of the mechanism were similar to those under inert atmosphere,
   but the degradation of the 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene continued giving
   1,2-naphthalenedione, then various polar monocyclic compounds leading to
   three unidentified volatile final products. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Since nitrification is the rate-determining step in the biological
   nitrogen removal from wastewater, many research studies have been
   conducted on the immobilization of nitrifying bacteria. In this
   research, granulation of nitrifying bacteria in an aerobic upflow
   fluidized bed (AUFB) reactor in a nitrification process for inorganic
   wastewater containing 500 g/m(3) of NH4+-N was investigated. It was
   observed that spherical, pseudocubic and elliptical granules with a
   diameter of 346 mum were produced at the bottom of the reactor after 300
   days. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that
   Nitrosomonas-like bacteria were the dominant ammonia-oxidizing species
   in the granules. Many colonies of Nitrosomonas-like bacteria were found
   in the outer part of the granules based on the spatial distribution
   analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization. By stepwise reduction of
   the hydraulic retention time, the ammonia removal rate of the AUFB
   reactor containing these nitrifying granules finally reached 1.5
   kg-N/m(3)/day. Results suggested that the use of granules realizes the
   retention of a large amount of nitrifying bacteria in the reactor, which
   guarantees a highly efficient nitrification. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Pinus radiata bark and tannins, chemically modified with an acidified
   formaldehyde solution were used for removing metal ions from aqueous
   solutions and copper mine acidic residual waters. The adsorption ability
   to different metal ions {[}V(V), Re(VII), Mo(VI), Ge(IV), As(V), Cd(II),
   Hg(II), Al(III), Pb(II), Fe(II), Fe(III), Cu(II)] and the factors
   affecting their removal from solutions were investigated. Effect of pH
   on the adsorption, desorption, maximum adsorption capacity of the
   adsorbents, and selectivity experiments with metal ion solutions and
   waste waters from copper mine were carried out. The adsorbents
   considerably varied in the adsorption ability to each metal ion. The
   adsorption depends largely upon the pH of the solution. Modified tannins
   showed lower adsorption values than the modified bark. For the same
   adsorbent, the maximum capacity at pH 3 for the different ions were very
   different, ranging for modified bark from 6.8 meqg(-1) for V to 0.93
   meqg(-1) for Hg. Waste waters were extracted with modified bark as
   adsorbent and at pH 2. The ions Cu(II) (35.2mgL(-1)), Fe(III) (198
   mgL(-1)), Al(III) (83.5 mgL(-1)) and Cd(II) (0.15 mgL(-1)) were removed
   in 15.6\%, 46.9\%, 83.7\% and 3.3\%, respectively, by using I g of
   adsorbent/10 mL of waste water. In general, a continuous adsorption on a

Abstract = {{Several methods for determining biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
   (BDOC) in water have been developed within the last two decades.
   However, the problem with most of these methods is the length of time
   required for the start-up (colonization) and/or determination from days
   to weeks. In this study, a simple and rapid continuous bioreactor
   procedure using immobilized cells was developed for BDOC determination.
   In the first stage of the development, the bioreactors were aerated to
   ensure that dissolved oxygen was not rate limiting. However, BDOC
   results obtained from the aerated bioreactors suffered from a large
   error caused by the release of background dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC). As a consequence, a different bioreactor scheme, in which the
   feed (sample) instead of the bioreactor was aerated, was tested. Results
   show that the feed aerated (FA) bioreactor is a better tool for BDOC
   determination especially for waters with low initial organic
   concentrations because of less background DOC released by the
   immobilized cell systems. Using the FA bioreactor, the accurate and
   reproducible measurement of BDOC can be achieved within a hydraulic
   retention time of 3 h, and no start-up period is required. (C) 2003

Title = {{A review of the biochemistry of heavy metal biosorption by brown algae}},

Abstract = {{The passive removal of toxic heavy metals such as Cd2+, Cu2+, Zn2+,
   Pb2+, Cr3+, and Hg2+ by inexpensive biomaterials, termed biosorption,
   requires that the substrate displays high metal uptake and selectivity,
   as well as suitable mechanical properties for applied remediation
   scenarios. In recent years, many low-cost sorbents have been
   investigated, but the brown algae have since proven to be the most
   effective and promising substrates. It is their basic biochemical
   constitution that is responsible for this enhanced performance among
   biomaterials. More specifically, it is the properties of cell wall
   constituents, such as alginate and fucoidan, which are chiefly
   responsible for heavy metal chelation. In this comprehensive review, the
   emphasis is on outlining the biochemical properties of the brown algae
   that set them apart from other algal biosorbents. A detailed description
   of the macromolecular conformation of the alginate biopolymer is offered
   in order to explain the heavy metal selectivity displayed by the brown
   algae. The role of cellular structure, storage polysaccharides, cell
   wall and extracellular polysaccharides is evaluated in terms of their
   potential for metal sequestration. Binding mechanisms are discussed,
   including the key functional groups involved and the ion-exchange
   process. Quantification of metal-biomass interactions is fundamental to
   the evaluation of potential implementation strategies, hence sorption
   isotherms, ion-exchange constants, as well as models used to
   characterize algal biosorption are reviewed. The sorption behavior
   (i.e., capacity, affinity) of brown algae with various heavy metals is
   summarized and their relative performance is evaluated. (C) 2003

   days using sodium acetate as co-substrate and considering COD and
   nitrobenzene concentration as paramount parameters for assessing the
   growth of biofilm and acclimation. A removal of 60-95.80\% COD and
   80-90.23\% nitrobenzene was observed during acclimation. During
   hydraulic retention time (HRT) studies, the optimum HRT was found to be
   29.55 h at which a maximum of 95.83\% COD and 97.93\% nitrobenzene
   removal was observed. Other studies included optimization of C:N ratio,
   substrate: co-substrate ratio, effect of shock loading and estimation of
   volatilization losses. The optimum C:N ratio was found to be 100:20 at
   which maximum 97.93\% removal of nitrobenzene was observed. At optimum
   HRT (29.55 h) and optimum C:N ratio (100:20) optimum substrate:
   co-substrate ratio was found to be 1:33. From the shock load studies it
   can be concluded that the system can withstand shock load up to two
   times of usual nitrobenzene concentration. A loss of 9.44\% nitrobenzene
   was observed due to volatilization and mass balance gave an efficiency
   of 87.49\% biological removal of nitrobenzene. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A bioreactor was constructed and used to treat a synthetic wastewater
   containing ammonium acetate and trace nutrients for about 190 days. The
   reactor was aerated by means of bundles of gas-permeable hollow-fiber
   membranes that were installed in the reactor. The membranes provided a
   specific surface area of 422 m(2)/M-3 and the external surface of the
   membranes rapidly became covered in an active biofilm. The membrane
   bundles were agitated by an internal gas recycle. The gas bubbles in the
   water encouraged fiber-fiber contact and were intended to control
   biofilm growth.
   Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removals in excess of 95\% were achieved in
   a 6h nominal detention time. Nitrification developed rapidly and
   complete oxidation of the influent ammonium was evident within 20 days.
   Even though the reactor was equipped with a large membrane surface area,
   the oxygen was consumed within the biofilm growing on the membrane
   surface. As a result, the external dissolved oxygen (DO) dropped to zero
   and the reactor was able to support essentially complete
   denitrification. After about 3 months of operation the reactor showed
   excellent removals of both COD and inorganic nitrogen but the
   performance could not be sustained. Excess biofilm accumulation
   eventually contributed to a deterioration in process performance.
   This study demonstrates that while membrane aeration can provide
   simultaneous BOD and N removal in the same reactor, the membrane
   modules/bioreactor must be designed to allow for the development of
   thick biofilms. In addition, options for controlling the biofilm
   thickness need to be investigated. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A method for preparing iron(III)-based binary oxide adsorbents in a
   granulated form for arsenic removal was studied. The key step in the
   method was the simultaneous generation of hydrous ferric oxide (FeOOH)
   sol and silica sol in situ in one reactor. This eventually led to the
   formation of Fe-Si complexes. The addition of silica enhanced the
   granulated adsorbent strength but reduced the arsenic adsorption
   capacity. An optimum Si/Fe molar ratio in the balance of adsorbent
   strength and arsenic adsorption capacity was found to be approximately
   0.33. The effects of aging time, drying temperature and process pH on
   adsorbents were also evaluated in the study. X-ray diffraction analysis
   confirmed that the iron(III) oxide in the Fe-Si binary oxide adsorbents
   was amorphous, largely due to the retardation of the iron oxide
   crystallization by the presence of silicate species. The surface area of
   the Fe-Si adsorbents and the particle size of Fe-Si complexed
   suspensions were determined as well. The batch strength testing
   procedure introduced in this study can provide a simple and quick
   evaluation of granulate strength in a wet status. Generally, this
   developed method can prepare granulated Fe-Si binary oxide adsorbents
   for column adsorption of arsenic from water. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Chlorine dioxide has been proposed as an alternative to chlorine because
   it is a powerful disinfection agent that does not react with ammonia or
   chlorinated organics to form chloramines or trihalomethanes. The major
   reduction product formed when chlorine dioxide is added to water is the
   chlorite ion. Chlorite has been shown to be less toxic than free or
   combined chlorine. However, previous studies with eight freshwater
   families produced a US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) acute
   water quality criteria (WQC) lower than the WQC for chlorine. In the
   current study, an additional 12 families were added to the toxicological
   database to determine ecological risk criteria (ERC) using both the
   standard USEPA WQC methodology and the USEPA Office of Pesticide
   Programs (OPP) probabilistic approach. Chlorite LC50 values for the 20
   family database ranged from 0.27mg/L for the Daphnidae to 208.76mg/L for
   the Salmonidae. The Daphnidae were by far the most sensitive family
   tested, with an LC50 44 times lower than the next most sensitive family
   tested, the Hyalellidae (LC50 = 1.19 mg/L) and 214 times lower than the
   most sensitive fish family tested, the Ictaluridae (LC50 5.79mg/L). The
   Criteria Maximum Concentration calculated using the USEPA WQC
   methodology was 0.025mg/L while the 95\% ERC calculated using the USEPA
   OPP probabilistic methodology was 0.135mg/L. The USEPA OPP probabilistic
   approach yields a criterion more consistent with the overall species
   sensitivity distribution and is not overly skewed by the low Daphnidae
   LC50 as is the USEPA WQC approach. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study examined the long-term effectiveness of permeable pavement as
   an alternative to traditional impervious asphalt pavement in a parking
   area. Four commercially available permeable pavement systems were
   evaluated after 6 years of daily parking usage for structural
   durability, ability to infiltrate precipitation, and impacts on
   infiltrate water quality. All four permeable pavement systems showed no
   major signs of wear. Virtually all rainwater infiltrated through the
   permeable pavements, with almost no surface runoff. The infiltrated
   water had significantly lower levels of copper and zinc than the direct
   surface runoff from the asphalt area. Motor oil was detected in 89\% of
   samples from the asphalt runoff but not in any water sample infiltrated
   through the permeable pavement. Neither lead nor diesel fuel were
   detected in any sample. Infiltrate measured 5 years earlier displayed
   significantly higher concentrations of zinc and significantly lower
   concentrations of copper and lead. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the current study, predictions by Simple Treat 3.0, a fate model for
   organic chemicals in sewage treatment plants (STPs), are compared with
   actual measurements in three STPs. Two polycyclic musks, Tonalide(R)
   (AHTN) and Galaxolide(R) (HHCB), were used for model evaluation. Results
   show that Simple Treat 3.0 is able to predict the removal efficiency
   within a factor 4. Predicted concentrations of both chemicals within the
   different physical compartments of STPs show a high correlation (r(2) =
   0.80) with experimental values. Although predicted free concentration
   levels were similar to previously reported experimental data, the trends
   along the compartments showed an inverse relationship. This bias of the
   model can be caused by an underestimation of BOD-removal (solids), or an
   overestimation of bacterial growth, evaporation, or a combination of
   these three factors. Results show that Simple Treat 3.0 is a valid tool
   for the risk assessment of slowly biodegradable chemicals, but still
   some adjustments of the model could be incorporated from a scientific
   point of view. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The seminal work of Rook (Water Treat. Exam. 23(Part 2) (1974) 234)
   initiated a considerable body of research regarding the formation of
   trihalomethanes (THMs) and other by-products of chlorine-based
   disinfection. Since that time, a broad spectrum of compounds has been
   identified as precursors to THM formation. More recently, it has been
   demonstrated that the presence of copper in solution enhances THM
   formation. Copper is known to catalyze a number of reactions that are
   similar to the conventional haloform reaction. A study was therefore
   initiated to investigate the specific role played by copper in the
   formation of chloroform during chlorination of water supplies. Aqueous
   solutions containing a number of known THM precursors were chlorinated
   in the presence and absence of copper, and subjected to time-course
   monitoring of chloroform concentration. The results of experiments with
   humic acid demonstrated an apparent catalytic effect on the part of
   copper in chloroform formation. To examine the role of copper in greater
   detail, a series of experiments involving aqueous solutions of pure
   compounds of humic substance structural units was conducted. Of the pure
   compounds investigated as THM precursors, only citric acid demonstrated
   enhanced chloroform formation in the presence of copper. A detailed
   matrix of experiments conducted with citric acid as a precursor
   demonstrated that copper, at environmentally relevant concentrations,
   can have a profound effect on chloroform formation. Based on previously
   published information regarding the mechanism of chloroform formation
   from citric acid and the results of these experiments, it is
   hypothesized that copper promotes chloroform formation from chlorination
   of citric acid through catalysis of oxidative decarboxylation, and the
   subsequent chlorination of ketoglutaric acid. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{To simulate the filtration and/or degradation of trickling sewage from
   leaky sewers through the non-water-saturated underground, sewage was
   trickled through sand of 0.4-2 mm from the Rhine valley in glass columns
   of 125 cm length. For the same sewage the chemical oxygen demand (COD)
   removal was almost independent of low or high trickling rates. The COD
   removal efficiency varied, however, from 67\% to 79\%, for sewage from
   rain and dry weather periods, respectively. The water content of the
   moist sand increased from initially 80ml kg(-1) with increasing sewage
   trickling rates to 108 ml kg(-1) sand. It remained at 108 ml kg(-1) at
   higher trickling rates higher than 600 ml d(-1). Analyses of effluent of
   five consecutive 25-cm soil columns revealed that about 50\% of the
   initial COD were filtrated off on top of the sand or degraded in the
   uppermost 25 cm. at varying trickling rates. Another 6-12\% of the COD
   were removed in the following 25-50 cm of sand, whereas almost no
   further COD removal was seen in the subsequent two or three 25-cm
   columns. The COD elimination during trickling of sewage through the
   segmented column (interrupted random flow) was slightly better than that
   in the non-segmented column. Total and faecal coliform bacteria
   decreased faster with increasing trickling depth than that of total
   aerobic or anaerobic bacteria. After a filter/degradation stretch of
   125cm elimination of all bacteria reached 96.2-99.9\%. The sewage
   contained low concentrations of at least 10 different pharmaceuticals or
   X-ray media. During trickling of sewage through sand, elimination of
   these compounds by adsorption onto sand and/or biodegradation varied
   from a complete removal, e.g. Ibuprofen or Naproxen, to almost no
   removal for several X-ray contrast media. Some of the medicals were
   removed as effectively as during conventional sewage treatment. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The oxidation of herbicide 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) by
   different iron-mediated processes, with or without the presence of
   ultraviolet (at 253.7 nm) and oxalate, was investigated and compared.
   The initial decay rate and the overall removal percentage were used as
   the performance indexes. To extensively explore the associated
   processes, the following combinations or blank systems were
   investigated: UV radiation only, Fe2+/H2O2, Fe2+/H2O2/UV, ferrous
   oxalate/H2O2, ferrous oxalate/H2O2/UV, Fe3+ /H2O2, Fe3+/H2O2/UV,
   ferrioxalate/H2O2, and ferrioxalate/ H2O2/UV. This study showed that the
   degradation of 2,4-D by sole UV or dark processes (without UV) is
   generally slow, except by the conventional Fenton's process (Fe2+/H2O2).
   However, these slow reactions can be accelerated by exposure to UV
   irradiation, which can increase the initial 2,4-D decay rate from ten to
   more than one hundred times. Furthermore, if the reaction is initiated
   by ferrous oxalate or ferrioxalate instead of Fe2+ or Fe3+ ions, the
   rates can be further improved, because of the higher light sensitivity
   of the organometallic complexes. These reactions were also found
   sensitive to the initial hydrogen peroxide concentration. The
   competition of hydroxyl free radicals by the primary intermediate,
   2,4-dichlorophenol, was also observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Batch adsorption experiments using powdered activated carbon (PAC) to
   remove trace synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) from water containing
   natural organic matter (NOM) were conducted. The percentage of SOC
   removed at any contact time and at any PAC dose was observed to be
   independent of the initial SOC concentration. Equations derived from the
   ideal adsorbed solution theory and the pore surface diffusion model
   validated this observation. For the strongly adsorbing SOCs (simazine
   and simetryn), the percentage of SOC removed was independent only at low
   initial SOC concentrations. The NOM fraction competing with the weakly
   adsorbing SOC (asulam) constituted a larger percentage of the total NOM
   than that competing with the strongly adsorbing SOCs. Although the
   adsorptive capacities of the SOCs were greatly reduced in water
   containing NOM compared with those in pure water, the change in the pore
   diffusion coefficient was insignificant. Therefore, NOM competed with
   the SOCs for adsorption sites, reducing the adsorptive capacity, but the
   amount of NOM loading was not so severe that it blocked or filled the
   pores, hindering the internal diffusion of the SOCs. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chlorine is widely used in public water supplies to provide a
   disinfection barrier. The effect of chlorine disinfection on the
   water-borne pathogen Burkholderia pseudomallei was assessed using
   multiple techniques. After exposure to chlorine viable bacteria were
   undetectable by conventional plate count techniques; however,
   persistence of B. pseudomallei was verified by flow cytometry and
   bacteria were recoverable following a simple one-step broth procedure.
   The minimum residual chlorine concentration and contact time as
   prescribed by potable water providers in Australia was insufficient to
   reduce a B. pseudomallei population by more than 2log(10). Chlorine had
   a bacteriostatic effect only on B. pseudomallei; viable bacteria were
   recovered from water containing up to 1000 ppm free chlorine. This
   finding has practical implications for water treatment in regions where
   B. pseudomallei is endemic. Future work to assess the effect of
   alternative water disinfection processes either singly or in sequence is
   necessary. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The human estrogen receptor a-test, hosted in a yeast strain, was used
   to quantify estrogenicity in three-week composite samples of untreated
   and treated effluents from 20 Swedish municipal sewage treatment plants.
   The treatment plants were selected to represent different treatment
   processes regarding chemical precipitation and microbial procedures. The
   discharge from Swedish domestic sewage treatment plants contained
   estrogenic compounds corresponding to <0.1-15 ng estradiol
   equivalents/L. Low levels of estrogenic activity were also found in a
   river receiving municipal effluents, 3.5-35 kin downstream the outlet
   from a sewage treatment works. The range of estrogenicity in untreated,
   raw sewage effluents was found to be 1-30ng estradiol equivalents/L.
   Generally, wastewater treatment reduced the estrogenicity and extended
   biological treatment was most effective in its removal. Activated sludge
   treatment tended to be more effective than trickling filters, whereas
   chemical precipitation using iron or aluminium salts without biological
   treatment showed little effectivity. The study showed that treatment
   methods in current use are able to eliminate or largely reduce
   estrogenicity in domestic wastewater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The interactions of silver ion with wastewater constituents including
   chloride, sludge particulates, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were
   investigated using fresh and processed sludge samples from various
   municipal wastewater treatment plants. Fresh sludge samples were used to
   examine the silver removal characteristics in the presence of chloride.
   Processed sludge samples that were subjected to a deionized-water
   washing procedure to remove the chloride ion were used to examine the
   interactions among Ag(I), sludge solids, and DOM. Results showed that,
   under field conditions, most of the silver can be removed through
   precipitation with chloride and adsorption by sludge particulates.
   Results obtained using washed sludge samples showed that Ag(I)
   adsorption by sludge particulates increases with the increase of pH in
   the acidic pH range, but decreases with the increase of pH in the
   alkaline pH range. Since the DOM concentration increases significantly
   with the increase of pH in the alkaline pH region, it can be concluded
   that the formation of Ag(I)-DOM complexes reduces the Ag(I) adsorption
   by sludge. Fitting of the Langmuir isotherm to the adsorption data
   indicated that adsorption constants have a slight increase with the
   increase of pH in the acidic pH range, but decrease significantly with
   the increase of pH in the alkaline pH range. The decrease of the Ag(I)
   adsorption constants in the alkaline pH range can be attributed to the
   formation of Ag(I)-DOM complexes which weaken the Ag(I) binding strength
   by sludge surface sites. The fitted isotherms also showed that the Ag(I)
   adsorption capacity increases with the increase of pH in the entire pH
   range. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Minimization of excess sludge production for biological wastewater

Abstract = {{Excess sludge treatment and disposal currently represents a rising
   challenge for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to economic,
   environmental and regulation factors. There is therefore considerable
   impetus to explore and develop strategies and technologies for reducing
   excess sludge production in biological wastewater treatment processes.
   This paper reviews current strategies for reducing sludge production
   based on these mechanisms: lysis-cryptic growth, uncoupling metabolism,
   maintenance metabolism, and predation on bacteria. The strategies for
   sludge reduction should be evaluated and chosen for practical
   application using costs analysis and assessment of environmental impact.
   High costs still limit technologies of sludge ozonation-cryptic growth
   and membrane bioreactor from spreading application in full-scale WWTPs.
   Bioacclimation and harmful to environment are major bottlenecks for
   chemical uncoupler in practical application. Sludge reduction induced by
   oligochaetes may present a cost-effective way for WWTPs if unstable worm
   growth is solved. Employing any strategy for reducing sludge production
   may have an impact on microbial community in biological wastewater
   treatment processes. This impact may influence the sludge
   characteristics and the quality of effluent. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effects of submerged macrophytes on sediment resuspension and
   internal phosphorus loading in the shallow Kirkkojarvi basin of Lake
   Hiidenvesi were studied by sedimentation traps and sediment and water
   samples. During the 83d study period, 793g DWm(-2) of sediment was
   resuspended within the stand formed by Ranunculus circinatus,
   Ceratophyllum demersum and Potamogeton obtusifolius. Outside the stand,
   1701 g DW m(-2) sediment resuspension was measured during the same
   period. Water turbidity and concentration of suspended solids (SS) were
   significantly lower within the plant bed compared with the surrounding
   water area. Despite the higher concentration of inorganic suspendoids,
   the concentration of chlorophyll a was higher in the open water than
   within the submerged plant bed, owing to the enhanced nutrient recycling
   rate in the absence of submerged plants. With the resuspended sediment,
   11.8 mg P m(-2) d(-1) was brought into the water column within the stand
   and 24.5 mg P m(-2) d(-1) outside the stand. Within the macrophyte
   stand, resuspended particles absorbed phosphorus from the water
   (indicated by the inverse relationship between SS and soluble reactive
   phosphorus), which was probably connected to the lowered phosphorus
   concentration of surface sediment due to uptake by macrophytes. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Water passing through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta contains elevated
   concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and trihalomethane
   (THM) precursor relative to upstream waters from the Sacramento River
   and the San Joaquin River. Drainage from agricultural peat soils has
   been identified as one of the major sources of DOC and THM precursor. A
   series of controlled laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate
   abiotic and biotic effects on the quantity and the nature of DOC and THM
   precursors produced from oxidized surface and reduced subsurface soils
   in the Delta. For abiotic effects, DOC was extracted from both soils
   with synthetic solutions containing a range of salinity (0-4dS/m) and
   sodicity (0 to infinity). The results showed that an increase in
   salinity significantly decreased the concentration of DOC in the
   soil-water from both soils but increased its aromaticity, as indicated
   by specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA). For biotic effects,
   peat soils were incubated over a range of temperatures (10degreesC,
   20degreesC and 30degreesC) and soil moisture contents (0.3-10g water/g
   soil). After 8 weeks of incubation, only extracted DOC from flooded
   conditions and flooded and non-flooded cycles showed an increase in DOC.
   These findings indicate that neither salinity nor sodicity is the major
   factor for DOC production, but both can affect the solubility and
   mobility of DOC in the Delta soils. We believe wetting processes in
   oxidized peat soils produce significant amounts of DOC found in
   agricultural drainage discharged into the Delta waters. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Biosorption of lead, cadmium, nickel and zinc by live and dead Mucor
   rouxii biomass treated with NaOH was studied over a range of pH. In the
   case of dead biomass, low pH resulted in a decrease in the biosorption
   capacity. At pH 3.0 or less, the inhibition of biosorption of metal ions
   took place. At pH 4.0 or higher, the biosorption of metal ions increased
   sharply. Ho's pseudo-second-order model described the biosorption
   kinetics better than the Lagergren model. Live biomass had high
   biosorption capacity, i.e. 35.69, 11.09, 8.46 and 7.75 mg/g at pH 5.0
   for Pb2+, Ni2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+, respectively. The dead biomass adsorbed
   metal ions in the order of Pb2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+, with the
   biosorption capability of 25.22, 16.62, 8.36 and 6.34mg/g at pH 5.0,
   respectively. At pH 6.0, the capacity of the dead biomass increased to
   53.75, 53.85, 20.31 and 20.49mg/g, respectively. For bi- or multi-metal
   ion adsorption, biosorption capacity of individual metal ion was reduced
   in the presence of other metal ions, but the total biosorption capacity
   increased, indicating the capability of M. rouxii biomass in adsorbing
   multi-metal ions. In addition, M. rouxii biomasses cultured with
   different media exhibited the same level of capacity to bind metal ions.
   Metal ions adsorbed by the biomass could be eluted effectively with
   HNO3, while distilled water demonstrated negligible metal elution
   capability. Regeneration of the biomass with NaOH regained or enhanced
   the biosorption capacity even after five cycles of
   adsorption-elution-regeneration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   investigated in a lab-scale biofilter treating toluene and p-xylene.
   Nitrogen utilization rates and the quantity of nitrogen recycled to meet
   microbial demand in the biofilm were estimated using a nitrogen balance
   approach. Experimental data imply that overall biofilter performance was
   a strong function of normalized nitrogen levels in the synthetic media.
   The biodegradation of p-xylene was found to be more sensitive to media
   nitrogen levels than was the degradation of toluene. However, increasing
   the nitrogen supply improved both toluene (> 99\%) andp-xylene removal
   efficiencies (> 90\%). Nitrogen balance calculations indicate that
   substantial recycling of nitrogen occurred in the biofilm even under
   nitrogen-rich conditions. The fraction of nitrogen demand met by
   recycling nitrogen increased when the external supply of nitrogen was
   terminated, and the biofilm became nitrogen limited. However, to avoid
   severe nitrogen limitation conditions, an external nitrogen source must
   be provided to sustain high pollutant removals in the biofilter. (C)

Abstract = {{A new spectrophotometric method is proposed for direct determination of
   alkylphenol polyethoxylate, RO(CH2CH2O)(n)H (where R is alkylphenyl and
   n is the degree of polymerization), in wastewater. The method is based
   on the formation of ternary complex,
   Pb(II)-meso-tetra-(3,5-dibromo-4-hydrooxyphenyl)-Porphyrin
   (T(DBHP)P)-alkylphenol polyethoxylate (APE). Under optimum reaction
   conditions, T(DBHP)P reacts with lead(II) and APE to form a yellow
   ternary complex with the maximum absorption peak at 479 nm. The color
   reaction is rapidly completed and the absorbance remains stable for at
   least 24 h under room temperature. The apparent molar absorption
   coefficients were 0.4-4.3 x 10(4) L mol(-1) cm(-1) for n = 5-50. As
   little as 0.02 mug mL(-1) of APE can be detected. The effects of various
   substances on the determination of APE were also investigated in detail.
   It was found that all the studied coexisting substances, especially
   cationic and anionic surfactants, which always seriously interfere in
   some reported methods, could be tolerated in considerable amounts. The
   method offered the advantages of simplicity, rapidity, sensitivity and
   selectivity without any prior separation or extraction. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Batch experiments with bipolar aluminum electrodes and potentiodynamic
   polarization tests with monopolar systems were conducted to investigate
   the effects of the type and concentration of co-existing anions on
   defluoridation in electrocoagulation (EC) process. The results
   demonstrate that the type of the dominant anion directs the EC
   defluoridation reaction. The defluoridation efficiency was almost 100\%
   and most of the fluoride removal reaction occurred on the surface of the
   anode in the solution without the co-existing anions, due to the
   electro-condensation effect. In the solutions with co-existing anions,
   most of the defluoridation took place in bulk solution. The residual
   fluoride concentration is a function of the total mass of Al(III)
   liberation from anodes and the types of the functions in the solutions
   with and without co-existing anions are different. The existence of
   sulfate ions inhibits the localized corrosion of aluminum electrodes,
   leading to lower defluoridation efficiency because of lower current
   efficiency. The presence of chloride or nitrate ions prevented the
   inhibition of sulfate ions, and the chloride ions were more efficient.
   Different corrosion types occurred in different anion-containing
   solutions and the form of corrosion affected the kinetic over-potential.
   The bypass flow causes the decrease of current efficiency and the
   proportion of the bypass flow of current increased due to a rise of the
   kinetic over potential and the conductivity of the solution. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A multi-sensor approach was used to determine high-resolution porewater
   gradients of Ca2+, CO32-, H+ and O-2 in sediment cores along a depth
   transect from eutrophic Lake Sernpach (Switzerland). We quantified the
   reproducibility of measurements and analyzed concentration profiles with
   a one-dimensional diffusion-reaction model to quantify benthic fluxes.
   Calculation of oxic respiration in the sediment showed that almost all
   settled organic carbon was degraded with O-2 at shallow depths while
   only 28 \% was decomposed aerobically at the deepest location. Fluxes
   were highest at 8 m depth (24.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1)) and lowest at the
   deepest site of 85m (7.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)). Dissolution of calcite from
   the sediment was also depth dependent. A total of 1.1 mmol m(-2) d(-1)
   was found for the shallowest site, and values decreased with depth to
   0.6 mmol m(-2) d(-1) at the deepest site. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to use Bayesian methods to estimate
   the kinetic parameters for the inactivation kinetics of Cryptosporidium
   parvum oocysts with chlorine dioxide or ozone which are characterized by
   the delayed Chick-Watson model, i.e., a lag phase or shoulder followed
   by pseudo-first-order rate of inactivation. As the length of the lag
   phase (CTlag) is not known, Bayesian statistics provides a more accurate
   approach than traditional statistical methods to fitting the delayed
   Chick-Watson kinetics. Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to
   estimate CTlag and first-order rate constant values. This method is also
   used to estimate the minimum CT requirement (with safety factor) for
   99\% inactivation of C parvum oocysts. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biosorption has been demonstrated to be a useful alternative to
   conventional treatment systems for the removal of toxic metals from
   dilute aqueous solution. The objective of this paper was to examine the
   main aspects of a possible strategy for the removal of arsenates,
   employing P. chrysogenum biomass. The pretreatment of biomass with
   common surfactants (as hexadecyl-trimethylammonium bromide and
   dodecylamine) and a cationic polyelectrolyte was found to improve the
   biosorption efficiency. The initial biomass showed a relative low
   affinity for metallic anions, whereas with the application of modified
   samples a significant uptake of arsenic was observed. Sorption data were
   well described by typical Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption isotherms.
   Promising results were obtained in laboratory experiments and effective

Abstract = {{Exposure to endotoxins in treated drinking water can occur through
   ingestion, dermal abrasions, inhalation of water vapor, intravenous
   injection or during dialysis. While the risks associated with endotoxin
   ingestion and entry through dermal abrasions are not well quantified,
   adverse effects of intravenous injection and dialysis are well known and
   some studies indicate that inhalation of moisture-laden air may impact
   human health. This study quantifies the inactivation of endotoxin
   derived from Escherichia coli O55:B5 by three substances used either as
   disinfectants or oxidants in drinking water treatment: chlorine,
   monochloramine and potassium permanganate. Inactivation rates were found
   to be 1.4, 1.0 and 0.7 endotoxin units (EU)/mL h, for free chlorine,
   potassium permanganate and monochloramine, respectively. These rates are
   relatively slow given that contact times in drinking water distribution
   systems are typically less than 48 h. While small amounts of endotoxin
   may be removed by oxidation the observed removals are much less than
   those provided by physical removal processes. The significance of this
   finding is important for dialysis considerations but is as yet unclear
   with regard to inhalation, as the risk of inhaling sufficient quantities
   of endotoxin-containing aerosolized water droplets to adversely affect
   human health has not yet been adequately quantified. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anaerobic digestion is an appropriate technique for the treatment of
   sludge before final disposal and it is employed worldwide as the oldest
   and most important process for sludge stabilization. In general,
   mesophilic anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge is more widely used
   compared to thermophilic digestion. Furthermore, thermal pre-treatment
   is suitable for the improvement of stabilization, enhancement of
   dewatering of the sludge, reduction of the numbers of pathogens and
   could be realized at relatively low cost especially at low temperatures.
   The present study investigates (a) the differences between mesophilic
   and thermophilic anaerobic digestion of sludge and (b) the effect of the
   pretreatment at 70 degreesC on mesophilic and thermophilic anaerobic
   digestion of primary and secondary sludge. The pretreatment step showed
   very positive effect on the methane potential and production rate upon
   subsequent thermophilic digestion of primary sludge. The methane
   production rate was mostly influenced by the pre-treatment of secondary
   sludge followed by mesophilic and thermophilic digestion whereas the
   methane potential only was positively influenced when mesophilic
   digestion followed. Our results suggest that the selection of the
   pre-treatment duration as well as the temperature of the subsequent
   anaerobic step for sludge stabilization should depend on the ratio of

Abstract = {{The City of Montreal Wastewater Treatment Plant uses enhanced
   physicochemical processes (ferric and/or alum coagulation) for suspended
   solids and phosphorus removal. The objective of this study was to assess
   the ability of peracetic acid (PAA), UV, or ozone to inactivate the
   indicator organisms fecal coliforms, Enterococci, MS-2 coliphage, or
   Clostridium perfringens in the effluent from this plant.
   PAA doses to reach the target fecal coliform level of 9000 CFU/100 mL
   exceeded 6 mg/L; similar results were obtained for enterococci, and no
   inactivation of Clostridium perfringens was observed. However a 1-log
   reduction of MS-2 occurred at PAA doses of 1.5 mg/L and higher. It was
   expected that this effluent would have a high ozone demand, and would
   require relatively high UV fluences, because of relatively high effluent
   COD, iron and suspended solids concentrations, and low UV transmittance.
   This was confirmed herein. For UV, the inactivation curve for fecal
   coliforms showed the typical two-stage shape, with the target of 1000
   CFU/100 mL (to account for photoreactivation) occurring in the asymptote
   zone at fluences >20 mJ/cm(2). In contrast, inactivation curves for MS-2
   and Clostridium perfringens were linear. Clostridium perfringens was the
   most resistant organism. For ozone, inactivation was already observed
   before any residuals could be measured. The transferred ozone doses to
   reach target fecal coliform levels ( similar to2-log reduction) were
   30-50 mg/L. MS-2 was less resistant, but Clostridium perfringens was
   more resistant than fecal coliforms.
   The different behaviour of the four indicator organisms studied,
   depending on the disinfectant, suggests that a single indicator organism
   might not be appropriate. The required dose of any of the disinfectants
   is unlikely to be economically viable, and upstream changes to the plant
   will be needed. 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Comparison of ammonia volatilisation rates in algae and duckweed-based

Abstract = {{Quantification of ammonia volatilisation from wastewater stabilisation
   ponds is important in order to understand its significance for overall
   nitrogen removal in these widely applied low-cost treatment systems.
   Ammonia volatilisation rates were measured in pilot plant facilities
   consisting of one line of four algae-based ponds in series and a
   parallel line of four ponds with a floating mat of duckweed (Lemma
   gibba). Ammonia volatilisation was assessed during a period of one and a
   half years. The method applied is accurate, convenient and is proposed
   for analysis of a wide range of gasses emitted from stabilisation ponds
   and possibly other aquatic systems. The ammonia volatilisation rates in
   algae-based ponds (ABPs) were higher than in duckweed-based ponds
   (DBPs). This can be explained by the lower values of NH3 in DBPs due to
   shading and lower pH values, since the volatilisation rate highly
   correlated with free ammonia concentration (NH3) in pond water. The
   duckweed cover appeared not to provide a physical barrier for
   volatilisation of unionised ammonia, because whenever NH3 concentrations
   were equal in ABP and DBP also the volatilisation rates were equal.
   Volatilisation was in the range of 7.2-37.4 mg-N m(-2) d(-1) and
   6.4-31.5 mg-N m(-2) d(-1) in the ABPs and DBPs, respectively. Average
   influent and effluent ammonium nitrogen measurements showed that the
   ammonia volatilisation during the study period in any system did not
   exceed 1.5\% of total ammonium nitrogen removal. Therefore this study
   confirmed results from simultaneous experimental work in our laboratory
   indicating that nitrification/denitrification, rather than ammonia
   volatilisation, is the most important mechanism for N removal in ABPs
   and DBPs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of various types of contaminants in water treatment plant by
   sophisticated analytical methods such as inductively coupled plasma/mass
   spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry requires hours to
   days to provide the results. Because naturally occurring ultraviolet
   (UV) active compounds are commonly present in almost all source waters
   and can be rapidly monitored by UV absorbance at 260 nm (E260), the
   extent of correlation between the removal efficiency of E260 and the
   removal efficiency of As(V) with minimum soluble residual Al by
   coagulation process was investigated. Percentage removals for E260 were
   well correlated to those of As(V). When sufficient alum or polyaluminum
   chloride (PACT) was added for 60-65\% removal of E260, 90-95\% removal
   of As(V) was achieved with minimum soluble residual Al regardless of the
   initial level of turbidity, E260, and As(V). As E260 analysis is
   precisely available even by an unskilled plant operator in a few
   minutes, E260 removal efficiency appears to be the promising economical
   indicator for monitoring the effectiveness of the coagulation process
   for the removal of contaminants with minimum residual Al. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The performances of three anaerobic hybrid reactors with various nylon
   fiber densities per packed bed volume (33, 22, and 11 kg/m(3) in R1, R2,
   and R3, respectively) as supporting media were evaluated through their
   ability to remove organic compounds in cassava starch wastewater. In
   addition, the distributions of non-methanogenic and methanogenic
   population in the reactors were investigated. During a 6-month
   operation, the organic loading rate was increased in stepwise from 0.5
   to 4.0 kg COD/m(3)/day and the hydraulic retention time (HRT) shortened
   to 5.4 days. The COD removal efficiency was more favorable in R1 (87\%)
   and R2 (84\%) than in R3 (70\%). The total biomass in the reactors with
   greater nylon fiber densities was also higher and increased from 20.4 to
   67.3 g VSS and to 57.5 g VSS in RI and R2, respectively. When the HRT
   was further shortened to 3 days, however, the efficiency of both
   reactors demonstrated a declining trend and reached 74\% in R1 and 61\%
   in R2. The distribution of microbial populations involved in the
   reactors was determined using the Most Probable Number technique. The
   result showed the lowest number of methanogens in R3 which correlated
   well to its relatively low efficiency. The number of non-methanogens in
   all reactors was, nonetheless, comparable. By shortening the HRT to 3
   days, the methanogenic population in R2 diminished in both attached and
   suspended biomass whereas a slight reduction was detected only in the
   attached biomass of R1. 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A standardisation of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis embryo-larval
   bioassay for marine pollution assessment has been developed. The minimum
   percentage of embryogenesis success was established to assess the
   quality of the biological material used; minimum sample size and number
   of replicates per treatment were also estimated. The suitability of
   artificial and natural seawater for the incubation of ascidian embryos
   and larvae was compared, and the optimum conditions of temperature,
   salinity, pH, density of embryos in the vials and the sperm/egg ratio
   were investigated. On the basis of the 10th percentile of the
   distribution of larval abnormalities, we proposed a threshold of 50\%
   normal larvae in the control in order to consider the test of acceptable
   biological quality. According to our results n = 5 is a sufficiently
   high replication to detect 5\% differences among treatment means with a
   power of P = 90\% and alpha = 0.05, and a sampling size greater than or
   equal to222 allows a 95\% confidence in the estimate with an error of
   0.05. Egg density did not affect larval development within the range
   1-20 eggs/ml, and the optimum sperm/egg ratio which fertilise 100\% of
   the eggs was 3000-30,000 sperm/egg (i.e. 10(8)-10(7) sperm/ml). There
   were not significant differences between the two water types tested, and
   the optimum tolerance ranges were 18-23 degreesC temperature, 34-42 ppt
   salinity (42 ppt was the highest salinity tested), and 7.4-8.8 pH. The
   median effective concentration (EC50) of copper (Cu) causing a 50\%
   reduction of normal hatched larvae was 54.2 mug/l (0.85 muM), which
   shows a sensitivity of this species similar to the commonly used bivalve
   and sea-urchin tests. The ascidian embryo-larval bioassay is an
   accurate, reliable, simple and rapid method that can be used in
   ecotoxicological studies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the ratio of sulfur
   added to total sediment solids (SA/TS) on the remobilization of heavy
   metals from contaminated river sediment by indigenous sulfur-oxidizing
   bacteria. Also, the difference in metal binding fractions before and
   after bioleaching was explored. It was found that sediment pH decreased
   at a significantly faster rate at higher SA/TS ratios (0.413 and 0.199)
   than at lower ones. Sulfate concentrations increased at a faster rate at
   these higher SA/TS ratios. At the lower SA/TS ratios, more acid must be
   produced and therefore it took more time for sulfur-oxidizing bacteria
   to lower the sediment pH. Remobilization efficiency of total extractable
   Pb and Cr was significantly higher at higher SA/TS ratios. After
   bioleaching, Mn-oxides became a stronger binding pool, and the
   percentage of Pb and Zn bound to Mn-oxides and Cr and Cu bound to
   organic matter increased with the decrease of SA/TS. Different heavy
   metals showed different binding behavior at the various SA/TS ratios.

Abstract = {{The accumulation of calcium on biological activated carbon (BAC) and
   their effects on adsorption of synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) were
   studied using BAC, which have been operated for 5 (BAC5.0) and 3.5
   (BAC3.5) years in a pilot-scale water purification plant, and granular
   activated carbon (GAC) preloaded with fulvic acid and/or calcium. The
   major inorganic material accumulated on BAC was calcium. The amounts of
   calcium on BAC5.0 and BAC3.5 were 36.6 and 29.7 mg g(-1), respectively.
   Seventy-one percent of calcium existed as calcium carbonate in both
   BACs. BAC5.0 had higher amount of accumulated calcium than BAC3.5 even
   though both BACs have already exhausted for NOM in the influent in
   1-year operation, suggesting that calcium carbonate gradually
   accumulated on BAC even after the 3.5 years of operation. The isotherms
   of GAC preloaded with fulvic acid and/or calcium clearly indicated that
   the calcium accumulation on GAC reduced adsorption capacity for
   simazine. The conclusion also confirmed by significant recovery of
   adsorption capacity of both BACs by acid-washing to remove accumulated
   calcium from BACs. The difference of adsorption capacity between BAC3.5
   and BAC5.0 was caused not only by the difference of adsorbed NOM but
   also the difference in the amount of accumulated calcium. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A modeling procedure that predicts trihalomethane (THM) formation from
   field sampling at the treatment plant and along its distribution system
   using Tampin district, Negeri Sembilan and Sabak Bernam district,
   Selangor as sources of data were studied and developed. Using Pearson
   method of correlation, the organic matter measured as TOC showed a
   positive correlation with formation of THM (r = 0.380, P = 0.0001 for
   Tampin and r = 0.478, P = 0.0001 for Sabak Bernam). Similar positive
   correlation was also obtained for pH in both districts with Tampin (r =
   0.362, P = 0.0010) and Sabak Bernam (r = 0.215, P = 0.0010). Chlorine
   dosage was also found to have low correlation with formation of THM for
   the two districts with Tampin (r = 0.233, P = 0.0230) and Sabak Bernam
   (r = 0.505, P = 0.0001). Distance from treatment plant was found to have
   correlation with formation of THM for Tampin district with r = 0.353 and
   P = 0.0010. Other parameters such as turbidity, ammonia, temperature and
   residue chlorine were found to have no correlation with formation of
   THM. Linear and non-linear models were developed for these two
   districts. The results obtained were validated using three different
   sets of field data obtained from own source and district of Seremban
   (Pantai and Sg. Terip), Negeri Sembilan. Validation results indicated
   that there was significant difference in the predictive and determined
   values of THM when two sets of data from districts of Seremban were used
   with an exception of field data of Sg. Terip for non-linear model
   developed for district of Tampin. It was found that a non-linear model
   is slightly better than linear model in terms of percentage prediction
   errors. The models developed were site specific and the predictive
   capabilities in the distribution systems vary with different
   environmental conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A river along the semi-arid Front Range of Colorado was monitored for
   antibiotics including five tetracycline and six sulfonamide compounds.
   Existing analytical methods were adapted to measure these compounds in a
   surface water matrix at environmentally relevant concentrations
   (0.05mug/L). Natural organic matter present in surface waters was
   confirmed to significantly impact the low-level analysis of
   tetracyclines (TCs) necessitating the use of standard addition
   quantification techniques. Five sites along the Cache la Poudre River
   were monitored for antibiotics encompassing pristine areas without
   anthropogenic influence, urban areas impacted by wastewater discharges
   and agricultural areas susceptible to non-point source contaminant
   runoff. The only site at which no antibiotics were detected was the
   pristine site in the mountains before the river had encountered urban or
   agricultural landscapes. By the time the river had exited the urban
   area. 6 of the 11 antibiotic compounds that were monitored were found in
   the samples. At Site 5, which had both urban and agricultural influences
   all five of the TCs monitored were detected indicating both urban and
   agricultural influences. The concentration of TCs at Site 5 ranged from
   0.08 to 0.30mug/L. 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Investigation of di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in the surface

   each sample of SM and SSW, indicating that the lake has been polluted by
   DEHP. Linear regression analysis showed that concentrations of DEHP were
   more strongly correlated with sampling temperature than with chlorophyll
   a concentrations. Correlation between DEHP concentrations and total
   phosphor concentrations was also obtained. Enrichment factors (EFs) of
   DEHP in the SM comparing with the corresponding SSW were ranging over
   0.85-2.12 with an average of 1.35. DEHP EFs were significantly related
   to both enrichment of chlorophyll a in the SM and sampling temperature.

Abstract = {{Non-ionic surfactant addition was investigated as a method to remediate
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) contaminated soil. The goal was to quantify
   surfactant (Tergitol NP-10 (TNP10)) and PCP sorption to soil and their
   interactive effects under varying pH, ionic strength, and soil
   conditions. Up to 16,700 mg/kg of TNP10 partitioned to soil, with
   increasing sorption far above the critical micelle concentration (CMC)
   and with greater amounts of PCP present. Approximately 40-45 times more
   TNP10 and 20-30 times more PCP sorbed to the finer soil with higher
   organic matter content. Aqueous TNP10 concentrations well above the CMC
   (greater than or equal to 5500 mg/L) were required to enhance PCP
   desorption from the soil. As pH increased by 0.5-0.85 units, TNP10
   sorption decreased by 14-25\% and PCP sorption as measured by the log of
   the equilibrium partition coefficient decreased by 1-1.5. A lower ionic
   strength of 0.03 versus 0.112 M increased PCP desorption from
   contaminated soil by 5-17\% in the presence of TNP10. This work is
   relevant to designing ex situ soil washing or surfactant-aided PCP
   remediation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Column experiments of nonsorbing and sorbing solutes were conducted in
   sandy aquifer material. Results of the column experiments were analyzed
   using a numerical nonequilibrium mass transfer model (designated as
   dispersed flow, film and particle diffusion model, DF-FPDM), an
   equilibrium advection-dispersion model (designated as dispersed flow,
   local equilibrium model, DF-LEM) as well as a nonequilibrium two region
   (mobile-immobile) advection-diffusion model (designated as homogeneous
   solid diffusion model, HSDM). Results of the analyses revealed that in
   all experiments the experimental BTCs are much better predicted by the
   DF-FPDM than by DF-LEM and HSDM. The relative influence of different
   processes (film diffusion, intraparticle diffusion and dispersion) can
   be identified by dimensionless mass transfer parameters N-F, N-S and
   N-D. Their plausibility can be compared with the well-known
   advection-dispersion-based equilibrium model. In general, spreading and
   asymmetry of sorbing solute BTCs can be explained with the DF-LEM and
   HSDM, but the identification of different processes and their influence
   on the total transport processes can only be ascertained with a model
   like DF-FPDM. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of in situ precipitated calcium carbonate from Na2CO3 and
   CaCl2 solutions on different substrates, i.e. stainless steel, copper,
   aluminium, and glass, was investigated at different temperatures,
   20degreesC, 40degreesC, 60degreesC and 80degreesC, both in the absence
   and presence of S-S 0.1 T magnetic field (MF). It was found that in
   quiescent conditions during 2 h the amounts deposited firmly on the
   surfaces decreased with increasing temperature. If MF was present the
   deposition was reduced at all temperatures, and depended on the nature
   of the substrate. The largest MF effect was found on glass at
   60degreesC, which amounted 50\% reduction of the deposit. However, at
   80degreesC no deposition was found in the presence of MF on aluminium
   surface. At this temperature the reproducibility of the experiments was
   poor, and an additional effect due to the metal surface corrosion
   (especially that of aluminium and copper) may be thought in alkaline
   environment of the experiments (pH ca. 10). Based on optical microscope
   photographs, it was concluded that the amounts of crystallographic forms
   of CaCO3 depended on the nature of substrate on which the precipitation
   and then the adhesion took place. To some extent the ratios of CaCo3
   forms precipitated were different in the bulk phase than on the
   substrate surfaces at the same temperature, and this conclusion was
   based on the X-ray diffractograms. Some possible mechanisms causing MF
   effects are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effective removal of soluble natural organic matter (NOM) during
   water treatment can significantly decrease the ClO2 demand of processed
   water. This can be achieved through the oxidation and/or the removal of
   NOM. The purpose of the study was to examine the influence of ClO2
   oxidation and subsequent GAC filtration on the final ClO2 demand of
   treated water. The study showed the ClO2 demand to be strongly
   correlated with the abundance of high molecular fractions of NOM in
   treated water. As it was shown, this part of NOM was effectively removed
   during the GAC filtration. Moreover, the pre-treatment of water with
   ClO2 considerably increased the total capacity of GAC filters for
   organic and inorganic (i.e. chlorites) oxidation by-products. Therefore,
   the oxidation of NOM molecules in conjunction with a very efficient GAC
   filtration can be successfully employed to control the abundance of high
   molecular NOM components, and thus the ClO2 demand of finished water.

Abstract = {{In the present study, we aimed to determine whether the concentrations
   of somatic coliphages, infectious enteroviruses or the detection of
   enterovirus genomes were associated with the detection of human
   pathogenic viruses in surface water. Four French rivers were sampled
   monthly or semimonthly for the quantitative detection of somatic
   coliphages, infectious enteroviruses and the qualitative RT-PCR
   detection of enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, Norwalk I viruses, Norwalk
   II viruses, astrovirus and rotavirus genomes over 12 months. All the 68
   water samples tested were positive for the quantitative detection of
   somatic coliphages (range of concentrations: 4 x 10(2) to 1.6 x 10(5)
   PFU l(-1)). Infectious enteroviruses were isolated by a cell culture
   system in only two (3\%) of the 68 concentrated water samples tested,
   whereas enterovirus genomes were detectable in 60 (88\%) of the same
   samples. A positive RT-PCR detection of the genome of hepatitis A virus,
   Norwalk-like virus genogroup II, astrovirus, rotavirus and Norwalk-like
   virus genogroup I was demonstrated, respectively, in 1.5\% (1/68), 1.5\%
   (1/68), 3\% (2/68), 0\% and 0\% of the 68 concentrated water samples
   tested. All of these four water samples were positive for the detection
   of enterovirus genomes, whereas only one of them was positive for the
   isolation of enteroviruses on cell culture. Moreover, the genomic
   detection of human pathogenic viruses appeared not to be statistically
   associated with the concentration levels of somatic coliphages in the 68
   concentrated water samples tested (Wilcoxon rank test; P = 0.14). Taken
   together, our findings indicate that the quantitative detection of
   somatic coliphages and the isolation of enteroviruses on cell culture
   are not suitable parameters for the control of the viral contamination
   in surface water, whereas the detection of enterovirus genomes may be
   useful for predicting the presence of waterborne viruses. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of phosphorus
   addition on biological pretreatment of raw water. Experiments were
   conducted in pilot-scale bio-ceramic filters with raw water from a
   reservoir located in Beijing, China. The results demonstrated that
   phosphorus was the limiting nutrient for bacterial growth in the raw
   water investigated in this study. The measured values of bacterial
   regrowth potential (BRP) and biodegradable dissolved organic carbon
   (BDOC) of the raw water increased by 50-65\% and 30-40\% with addition
   of 50mug of PO43--PL-1, respectively. Addition of 25 mug of PO43--PL-1
   to the influent of bio-ceramic filter enhanced the percent removal of
   organics by 4.6, 5.7 and 15 percentage points in terms of CODMn, TOC and
   BDOC, respectively. Biomass in terms of phospholipid content increased
   by 13-22\% and oxygen uptake rate (OUR) increased by 35-45\%. The ratio
   of C:P for bacteria growth was 100:1.6 for the raw water used in this
   study. Since change of phosphorus concentrations can influence the
   performance of biological pretreatment and the biological stability of
   drinking water, this study is of substantial significance for waterworks
   in China. The role of phosphorus in biological processes of drinking
   water should deserve more attention. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A predictive screening model was developed for fate and transport of
   viruses in the unsaturated zone by applying the final value theorem of
   Laplace transformation to previously developed governing equations. A
   database of input parameters allowed Monte Carlo analysis with the
   model. The resulting kernel densities of predicted attenuation during
   percolation indicated very small, but finite probabilities of failure
   for all homogeneous USDA classified soils to attenuate reovirus 3 by
   99.99\% in one-half meter of gravity drainage. The logarithm of
   saturated hydraulic conductivity and water to air-water interface mass
   transfer coefficient affected virus fate and transport about 3 times
   more than any other parameter, including the logarithm of inactivation
   rate of suspended viruses. Model results suggest extreme infiltration
   events may play a predominant role in leaching of viruses in soils,
   since such events could impact hydraulic conductivity. The air-water
   interface also appears to play a predominating role in virus transport
   and fate. Although predictive modeling may provide insight into actual
   attenuation of viruses, hydrogeologic sensitivity assessments for the
   unsaturated zone should include a sampling program. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{One concern with UV disinfection of water is the production of nitrite
   when polychromatic UV sources are utilized. Based on previous work, it
   was hypothesized that a small addition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) may
   be useful in controlling nitrite during UV disinfection. However, it was
   found that H2O2 addition (5 or 10mg/L) during polychromatic UV
   irradiation of drinking water at doses used for disinfection
   significantly increases the levels of nitrite produced relative to
   solutions without H2O2. Enhancement rates ranged from approximately 15\%
   to 40\% depending upon pH and H2O2 concentration; the relative increase
   in the NO2- yield was greater at pH 6.5 than at pH 8.3. The observed
   effects are tentatively ascribed to a combination of enhanced superoxide
   production and increased hydroxyl radical scavenging when H2O2 is added.
   These results indicate that H2O2 cannot be used to control nitrite
   production during UV disinfection and that enhanced nitrite formation
   will occur if H2O2 is added during UV water treatment to achieve
   advanced oxidation of contaminants. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The synergistic effect of sequential exposure to ozone followed by free
   chlorine on inactivation of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts suspended in
   natural waters was studied in bench-scale batch reactors. Animal
   infectivity using neonatal CD-1 mice was used to measure oocyst
   inactivation. The synergistic effect measured in two alkaline (pH 8.1)
   natural waters was statistically significant but was considerably
   smaller than previously reported in buffered de-ionized water at pH 6.0.
   Temperature, ozone primary treatment level, and water type did not have
   measurable impacts on the synergistic effect. Efforts to increase the
   synergistic effect by reducing the pH from 8 to 6 by acid addition were
   unsuccessful. In the two low alkalinity (pH 6.0) natural waters tested,
   the measured synergistic effect was greater than in the alkaline waters,
   but was still less than that measured previously in buffered de-ionized
   water. It was concluded that the synergistic effect reduction in the
   natural waters tested was due in part to alkalinity and in part to other
   unidentified water quality characteristics. Sequential treatment with
   ozone followed by free chlorine may only be a feasible strategy for
   achieving synergistic C parvum inactivation credit for water treatment
   facilities with natural waters having a low pH (near 6.0). (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The potent toxin microcystin is frequently released during
   cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic waters and may impose a risk to human
   health, when surface water is used for drinking water. For removal of
   microcystin in surface waters, infiltration through sediment is commonly
   used. In the present study, mineralization of C-14-labelled microcystin
   (accumulation of (CO2)-C-14) and concentration changes (protein
   phosphatase inhibition assay) demonstrated that indigenous
   microorganisms in the sediment of a water recharge facility were capable
   of degrading microcystin. At oxic or microaerophilic (<2\% O-2)
   conditions, microcystin added to sediment slurries at 70 mug l(-1) was
   reduced to <20 mug l(-1) in 1-2 weeks, and less than 3 mug l(-1) after 7
   weeks. At anoxic conditions (<0.3\% O-2) and with addition of nitrate,
   the degradation was significantly stimulated, reducing microcystin from
   100 to <20 mug l(-1) within 1 day. The simultaneous production of N2O in
   the samples suggests that the microcystin degradation was coupled to
   dissimilative nitrate reduction (denitrification). Since aquifers and
   sediments beneath drinking water reservoirs often are anoxic, nitrate
   respiration may be an important process in removal and detoxification of
   microcystin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Alachlor (2-chloro-N-(2,6-diethylphenyl)-N-(methoxymethyl)acetamide) is
   a moderately toxic herbicide that is frequently found in agriculturally
   impacted surface waters. To assess primary mechanism(s) that affect its
   fate in aquatic systems, two field experiments were performed using
   large mesocosms (n = 39) and smaller microcosms with and without
   microbial inhibitors (n = 16). The mesocosm experiment tested the effect
   of fertility conditions on alachlor fate, assessing alachlor
   disappearance over time under oligotrophic (total phosphorus (TP) < 12
   mug/L) through hypereutrophic (TP > 80 mug/L) water conditions. Whereas,
   the microcosm experiment assessed alachlor fate in the presence of
   microbial inhibitors that selectively blocked eubacterial
   (chloroamphenicol, streptomycin, and penicillin combined), eukaryotic
   (cycloheximide), and universal (all inhibitors) microbial activity.
   First-order alachlor transformation rate coefficients ranged from 0.006
   to 0.042 day(-1) when microbial inhibitors were not present (half-lives
   from 16 to 122 days) with the highest rates occurring in hypereutrophic
   waters. Statistics indicated that mean TP, and universal and eubacterial
   small sub-unit rRNA level most closely correlated with transformation
   rate. Further, the inhibitor study indicated that alachlor
   transformation was biotic ( >90\%), but that high transformation rates
   only occurred when eubacterial and eukaryotic domains were both
   metabolically active. Our results confirm that alachlor transformation
   is primarily biotic; however, efficient biotransformation only occurs
   when both major microbial domains in aerobic systems are active. (C)

Abstract = {{To increase the uptake capacity of mercury ions, several chemical
   modifications of chitosan beads which are crosslinked with
   glutaraldehyde were performed. Among them, aminated chitosan bead
   prepared through chemical reaction with ethylenediamine had a high
   uptake capacity of about 2.3 mmol g(-1) dry mass at pH 7. The increased
   number of amine groups was confirmed by IR analysis and measuring the
   saturation capacities for adsorption of HCl. The surface condition and
   existence of mercury ions on the beads was confirmed by the
   environmental scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy instrumental analyses. The beads showed the characteristic
   of competitive sorption between mercury and hydrogen ions and it was
   successfully modelled by an equilibrium model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A laboratory membrane bioreactor (MBR) using a submerged polyethylene
   hollow-fibre membrane module with a pore size of 0.4mum and a total
   surface area of 0.2 m(2) was used for treating a raw water supply
   slightly polluted by domestic sewage. The feeding influent had a total
   organic carbon (TOC) level of 3-5 mg/L and an ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N)
   concentration of 3-4mg/L. The MBR ran continuously for more than 500
   days, with a hydraulic retention time (HRT) as short as 1 h or less.
   Sufficient organic degradation and complete nitrification were achieved
   in the MBR effluent. which normally had a TOC of less than 2mg/L and a
   NH3-N of lower than 0.2 mg/L. The process was also highly effective for
   eliminating conventional water impurities, as demonstrated by decreases
   in turbidity from 4.50 +/- 1.11 to 0.08 +/- 0.03 NTU, in total coliforms
   from 10(5)/mL to less than 5/mL and in UV254 absorbance from 0.098 +/-
   0.019 to 0.036 +/- 0.007 cm(-1). With the MBR treatment, the 3-day
   trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) was significantly reduced
   from 239.5 +/- 43.8 to 60.4 +/- 23.1 mug/L. The initial chlorine demand
   for disinfection decreased from 22.3 +/- 5.1 to 0.5 +/- 0.1 mg/L. The
   biostability of the effluent improved considerably as the assimilable
   organic carbon (AOC) decreased from 134.5 +/- 52.7 to 25.3 +/- 19.9
   mug/L. All of these water quality parameters show the superior quality
   of the MBR-treated water, which was comparable to or even better than
   the local tap water. Molecular size distribution analysis and the
   hydrophobic characterisation of the MBR effluent, in comparison to the
   filtered liquor from the bioreactor, suggest that the MBR had an
   enhanced filtration mechanism. A sludge layer on the membrane surface
   could have functioned as an additional barrier to the passage of typical
   THM precursors, such as large organic molecules and hydrophobic
   compounds. These results indicate that the MBR with a short HRT could be
   developed as an effective biological water treatment process to address
   the urgent need of many developing countries that are plagued by the
   serious contamination of surface water resources. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The contents of soil/sediment organic carbon and clay minerals (i.e.
   montmorillonite, kaolinite, illite, gibbsite and 1.4 nm minerals) for 21
   natural soil/sediment samples and the sorption of Triton X-100 on these
   samples were determined. A multi-component statistic analysis was
   employed to investigate the importance of soil/sediment organic matters
   and clay minerals on their sorption of Triton X-100. The sorption power
   of soil/sediment composition for Triton X-100 conforms to an order of
   montmorillonite > organic carbon > illite > 1.4 nm minerals (vermiculite
   + chlorite + 1.4 nm intergrade mineral) much greater than kaolinite. The
   sorption of Triton X-100 on a montmorillonite, a kaolinite and a humic
   acid were also investigated and consistent with the result of
   multi-component statistic analysis. It is clear that the sorption of
   Triton X-100 on soils or sediments is the combined contribution of
   soil/sediment organic matters and clay minerals, which depended on both
   the contents of soil/sediment organic matters and the types and contents
   of clay minerals. The important influence of illite on the sorption of
   nonionic surfactants onto soils/sediments is suggested and demonstrated
   in this paper. Surfactants for aquifer remediation application may be
   more efficient for the contaminated soils/sediments that contain little
   clay minerals with 2:1 structure because of the less sorption of
   nonionic surfactants on these soils/sediments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matters (DOMs) from two batches of secondary effluent
   collected from a local water reclamation plant were fractionated using
   column chromatographic method with non-ionic resins XAD-8, AG MP-50 and
   IRA-96. Seven isolated fractions were obtained from the fractionation
   study and these fractions were quantified using DOC, UV254 and SUVA
   values. The fractionation study revealed that the secondary effluent
   samples comprised about 47.3-60.6\% of hydrophobic and 39.4-52.7\% of
   hydrophilic solutes. The treatability of each isolated fraction was
   investigated by subjecting each fraction to reverse osmosis (RO)
   treatment individually. It was noted that RO process could achieve high
   DOC rejections for acid and neutral fractions (ranging from 80\% to 98\%
   removal) probably due to the negative charge of RO membrane. The results
   obtained also indicated that hydrophobicity of DOMs is significant in
   determining treatability of organic species by RO process. The
   performance of RO in terms of DOC rejection of unfractionated secondary
   effluent was also investigated to assess possible effects of
   interactions among organic fractions on their treatability by RO
   process. It was noted that DOC rejection associated with the
   un-fractionated secondary effluent was generally higher (ranging from
   2\% to 45\%) than the corresponding rejection obtained from each
   individual fraction isolated from the secondary effluent. This finding
   suggested there is a beneficial interaction among the fractions that in
   turn has contributed towards a better overall DOC rejection performance
   by RO treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Given the high level of background flora in sludge, methods for
   detecting Listeria monocytogenes are not well established. In this
   study, two critical parameters for the detection of L. rnonocytogenes
   were evaluated: the concentration of Listeria sp. in a modified Fraser
   broth (first stage of the method) and the proportion of L. monocytogenes
   on Palcam agar (second stage of the method). Concentrations of Listeria
   sp. estimated in 118 modified Fraser enrichment broths inoculated with
   four types of sludge, reached 10(4) bacteria per mL for 83\% of the
   positive enrichment broths. Proportion of L. monocytoyenes on Palcam
   agar, which was estimated by transferring all characteristic colonies of
   Listeria sp. onto Rapid'L Mono agar, was highly variable regardless of
   the type of sludge. According to these results, we proposed a protocol
   that consisted of an enrichment in modified Fraser broth for 48 h at 37
   degreesC, followed by plating 0.1 mL of appropriate dilutions of broth
   onto Palcam agar. After an incubation of 48 h at 37 degreesC, a
   systematic identification of characteristic colonies of Listeria sp. on
   Rapid'L Mono agar allowed to enhance the detection of Listeria

Abstract = {{This study discusses a mathematical modeling and design protocol for
   bioactive granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorbers employed for
   purification of drinking water contaminated by chlorinated pesticides,
   exemplified by alachlor. A thin biofilm model is discussed that
   incorporates the following phenomenological aspects: film transfer from
   the bulk fluid to the adsorbent particles, diffusion through the biofilm
   immobilized on adsorbent surface, adsorption of the contaminant into the
   adsorbent particle. The modeling approach involved independent
   laboratory-scale experiments to determine the model input parameters.
   These experiments included adsorption isotherm studies, adsorption rate
   studies, and biokinetic studies. Bioactive expanded-bed adsorber
   experiments were conducted to obtain realistic experimental data for
   determining the ability of the model for predicting adsorber dynamics
   under different operating conditions. The model equations were solved
   using a computationally efficient hybrid numerical technique combining
   orthogonal collocation and finite difference methods. The model provided
   accurate predictions of adsorber dynamics for bioactive and
   non-bioactive scenarios. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the
   significance of various model parameters, and focussed on enhancement in
   certain key parameters to improve the overall process efficiency.
   Scale-up simulation studies for bioactive and non-bioactive adsorbers
   provided comparisons between their performances, and illustrated the
   advantages of bioregeneration for enhancing their effective service life
   spans. Isolation of microbial species revealed that fungal strains were
   more efficient than bacterial strains in metabolizing alachlor.
   Microbial degradation pathways for alachlor were proposed and confirmed
   by the detection of biotransformation metabolites and byproducts using
   gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to investigate the chemical heterogeneity of fulvic and humic
   acids previously isolated from a bleached Kraft pulp mill effluent, a
   sequential ultrafiltration (UF) scheme through four polyethersulphone
   membranes was applied. The unfractionated fulvic and humic acids and
   their fractions were characterized by UV-VIS, synchronous fluorescence
   (with Deltalambda = 60 nm) and FTIR spectroscopies. The FTIR spectra
   were compared with those of lignin isolated from Eucalyptus globulus
   wood and from the black liquor of a Kraft pulping process. The results
   highlighted that fulvic acids fractions of low molecular sizes contain
   more lignin derived phenolic units, while those of higher molecular size
   exhibit a higher content of carbohydrate structures. However, the shift
   observed in the UV-VIS absorbance and fluorescence intensity towards
   higher wavelength, suggests a higher degree of conjugation of pi-bonds
   in the fractions of highest molecular sizes. In what concerns the humic
   acids size fractions, the FTIR spectra did not exhibit major differences
   but, as observed for the fulvic acids' fractions, UV-VIS and synchronous
   fluorescence spectra also suggest a higher degree of conjugation of
   7r-bonds in the fractions with the highest molecular sizes. It was also
   observed that the fulvic and humic acids fractions of the same molecular
   size, operationally defined by the OF process, exhibit major differences
   in their spectroscopic features. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Wastewaters generated in the cork processing industry were treated in
   continuous reactors by means of single treatments separately-a chemical
   ozonation and an activated sludge system-and then by both sequential
   processes-ozonation followed by aerobic degradation, and aerobic
   degradation followed by ozonation. The removals obtained in the
   ozonation alone were 12-54\%, 65-81\%, and 55-89\% for the COD, total
   phenolics, and absorbance at 254 nm, respectively, while the consumed
   ozone yield ranged from 40\% to 61\%, and the biodegradability
   (BOD5/COD) varied from an initial 0.60 to final values between 0.68 and
   0.93. The optimum hydraulic retention time and ozone partial pressure
   were 3 h and 3 kPa, respectively. The stoichiometric ratio was 0.56 g of
   organic substrate degraded per g of ozone consumed, while the rate
   constants obtained for the ozone disappearance and for the organic
   matter degradation were 4490 L g COD-1 h(-1) and 1970 L g O-3(-1) h(-1)
   respectively. The presence of hydrogen peroxide or UV radiation in
   addition to ozone increased the values of organic matter removal as well
   as the stoichiometric ratio and the rate constants. The aerobic
   treatment by the activated sludge system yielded COD removals between
   13\% and 37\% for hydraulic retention times between 24 and 96 h, and the
   Contois model gave values of q(max) = 0.14 g COD g VSS-1 h(-1) and K-1 =
   22.6 g COD g VSS-1 for the main kinetic parameters. The sequential
   processes increased the substrate removal efficiencies in comparison
   with the individual processes. These enhancements were greater in the
   aerobic degradation-ozonation sequence than in the ozonation-aerobic
   degradation sequence. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a fuel oxygenate that is added to
   gasoline, commonly contaminates aquatic systems, many of which are
   already contaminated with pesticides. The toxic effects (EC50 value) of
   several pure pesticides (Diuron, Linuron, Dichlofluanid, Sea nine,
   Irgarol and tributyltin (TBT)) were measured and compared with the EC50
   value of the pesticide mixed with MTBE, using the Vibrio fischeri and
   Daphnia magna acute toxicity assays. The interaction between chemicals
   was evaluated in terms of the effects of mixing on the EC50 value (i.e.
   the concentration (mg/L) of a compound or mixture that is required to
   produce a 50\% change in a toxic response parameter) and the time
   required to generate the toxic response. Presence of MTBE enhanced the
   EC50 value of several pesticides (Diuron, Dichlofluanid, TBT and
   Linuron) and/or the toxic response manifested more rapidly than with
   pure pesticides. Toxicity enhancements were quite substantial in many
   cases. For example, the presence of MTBE increased the toxicity of
   Diuron by more than 50\% when tested with the V. fischeri assay (5, 15
   and 30 min exposure). Also, the toxic response manifested itself within
   5 min whereas without the MTBE the same response arose in 30 min.
   Presence of MTBE increased the toxicity of Dichlofluanid by 30\% when
   measured with the D. magna assay. Toxicities of only two pesticides (Sea
   nine and lrgarol) were not raised by the presence of MTBE. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The wastewaters discharged by raw milk quality control laboratories are
   more complex than the ones commonly generated by dairy factories because
   of the presence of certain chemicals such as sodium azide or
   chloramphenicol, which are used for preserving milk before analysis. The
   treatment of these effluents has been carried out in a full-scale plant
   comprising a 12 m(3) anaerobic filter (AF) reactor and a 28 m(3)
   sequential batch reactor (SBR). After more than 2 years of operation, a
   successful anaerobic treatment of these effluents was achieved, without
   fat removal prior to the anaerobic reactor. The organic loading rates
   maintained in the AF reactor were 5-6 kg COD/m(3) d, with COD removal
   being higher than 90\%. No biomass washout was observed, and most of the
   fat contained in the wastewaters was successfully degraded. The addition
   of alkalinity is crucial for the maintenance of a proper buffer medium
   to ensure pH stability. The effluent of the AF reactor was successfully
   treated in the SBR reactor, and a final effluent with a COD content
   below 200 mg/l and total nitrogen below 10 mg N/l was obtained. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of metallic iron (Fe-0) powder for nitrate
   removal in a well-mixed batch reactor. Important variables explored
   include Fe-0 dosage (1-3 g/L), UV light intensity (64-128 W), and the
   presence of propanol (20 mg/L as DOC) and H2O2 (100-200 mg/L).
   Accumulation of ferrous ions released from the Fe-0 surface can be
   expressed by an S-curve, which involves lag growth phase, exponential
   phase, rate-declining phase, and saturation phase. The removal of
   nitrate increases with increasing Fe dosage; however, the removal makes
   no difference as the Fe-0 dosage is greater than 2 g/L. UV irradiation
   retards the dissolution of ferrous ion and the removal of nitrate. The
   species of propanol, which has a functional group of -OH, plays a role
   of organic inhibitor for Fe-0 corrosion. The presence of H2O2 appears to
   inactivate all reactions as the Fe of 10 mum was used; the final H2O2
   remains intact throughout the entire reaction period, and there were no
   removal of nitrate and no dissolution of ferrous ion. Surprisingly, with
   the use of a larger Fe particle size of 150mum, the H2O2 was seen to
   decompose rapidly through Fenton reaction. Nevertheless, the rate of
   ferrous accumulation or nitrate removal is slow. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The application of different multivariate statistical approaches for the
   interpretation of a large and complex data matrix obtained during a
   monitoring program of surface waters in Northern Greece is presented in
   this study. The dataset consists of analytical results from a 3-yr
   survey conducted in the major river systems (Aliakmon, Axios, Gallikos,
   Loudias and Strymon) as well as streams, tributaries and ditches.
   Twenty-seven parameters have been monitored on 25 key sampling sites on
   monthly basis (total of 22,350 observations). The dataset was treated
   using cluster analysis (CA), principal component analysis and multiple
   regression analysis on principal components. CA showed four different
   groups of similarity between the sampling sites reflecting the different
   physicochemical characteristics and pollution levels of the studied
   water systems. Six latent factors were identified as responsible for the
   data structure explaining 90\% of the total variance of the dataset and
   are conditionally named organic, nutrient, physicochemical, weathering,
   soil-leaching and toxic-anthropogenic factors. A multivariate receptor
   model was also applied for source apportionment estimating the
   contribution of identified sources to the concentration of the
   physicochemical parameters. This study presents the necessity and
   usefulness of multivariate statistical assessment of large and complex
   databases in order to get better information about the quality of
   surface water, the design of sampling and analytical protocols and the
   effective pollution control/management of the surface waters. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Winery wastewaters are characterised by large seasonal fluctuations in
   volume and composition and are often discarded with little or no
   treatment. A rotating biological contactor (RBC) was used to investigate
   microorganisms associated with the biological treatment of winery
   wastewater. Extensive biofilms developed on the RBC discs and contained
   a number of yeast and bacterial species that displayed a dynamic
   population shift during the evaluation period. This suggested that the
   naturally occurring microorganisms were able to form a stable biofilm
   and also reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of winery wastewater
   (on average 43\% with a retention time of I h). One of the yeast
   isolates, MEA5, was able to reduce the COD of synthetic wastewater by
   95\% and 46\% within 24 h under aerated and non-aerated conditions,
   respectively. The yeast isolates could therefore play an important role
   in the degradation of organic compounds under aerobic conditions, such
   as those associated with an RBC. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The reactions of Fe(II) and other divalent metal ions including Zn, Co,
   Ni, and Cd on hematite were studied in single and competitive binary
   systems with high sorbate/sorbent ratios in 10 mM PIPES (pH 6.8)
   solution under strict anoxic conditions. Adsorbed Me(II) was defined as
   extractable by 0.5 N HCl within 20 h, and fixed Me(II) was defined as
   the additional amount that was extracted by 3.0 N HCl within 7 days.
   Binary systems contained Fe(II) plus a second metal ion. The extent of
   uptake of divalent metal ions by hematite was in order of Fe greater
   than or equal to Zn > Co greater than or equal to Ni > Cd. For all
   metals tested, there was an instantaneous adsorption followed by a
   relatively slow stage that continued for the next 1-5 days. This
   sequence occurred in both single and binary systems, and could have been
   due to a variety of sorption site types or due to slow conversion from
   outer- to inner-sphere surface complexes due to increasing surface
   charge. Sorption competition was observed between Fe(II) and the other
   metal ions. The displacement of Fe(II) by Me(II) was in order of Ni
   similar to Zn > Cd, and the displacement of Me(II) by Fe(II) was in

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the
   biosurfactant BS-UC on surface properties of microbial cells and
   biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. The biosurfactant BS-UC was
   produced by Candida antarctica from n-undecane as the substrate. It was
   found that the addition of BS-UC influenced positively the
   emulsification and the biodegradation of a variety of n-alkanes
   substrates. Besides, BS-UC also changed the hydrophobicity and zeta
   potential of the cell surface, and thus made the microbial cell attach
   to the hydrophobic substrate easily. The cell transport experiment also
   indicated that the addition of BS-UC changed both zeta potential of the
   cell and that of the porous media, and improved the retention of the
   cells in the media. So it will make BS-UC a promising choice for use in
   bioremediation of petroleum contamination. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Bacterial mortality has been investigated in freshwater (River Seine)
   and in marine (North Sea) systems using a method based on following the
   disappearance of radioactivity from the DNA of assemblages of bacteria
   previously labeled with tritiated thymidine. Measurement of bacterial
   mortality of autochthonous and various types of fecal bacteria allowed
   direct comparisons between their respective first-order mortality rates.
   Mortality rates obtained for the different types of bacteria in the
   River Seine were, respectively, 7.9-33.9 x 10(-3) h(-1) for Escherichia
   coli, 12.2-29.2 x 10(-3)h(-1) for S. faecium and 7.0-18.3 x 10-3 h(-1)
   for the autochthonous bacteria. In the Belgian coastal waters, these
   rates were 4.6-27.3 x 10(-3) h(-1) for E. coli, 6.0-22.0 x 10(-3) h(-1)
   for S. typhimurium, 10.0-18.9 x 10(-1) h(-1) for S. faecium and 1.0-13.9
   x 10(-3) h(-1) for autochthonous bacteria. In both environments, the
   overall mortality rates of autochthonous and the different fecal
   bacteria were in the same order of magnitude and overall mortality rates
   of E. coli were on average about twice as high for autochthonous
   bacteria. Grazing by protozooplankton was the dominant process of
   mortality for fecal and autochthonous bacteria in both environments.
   Except in a few situations, grazing by protozooplankton was responsible
   for more than 90\% of the overall mortality rate of fecal and
   autochthonous bacteria in the river and in the coastal area. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Direct measurement by high-performance size exclusion chromatography
   with fluorescence detection was applied to the characterization of humic
   substances in river waters from the Kuji River system, which runs
   through forest hills and an agricultural plain in Japan. The monitoring
   wavelength of excitation 320 nm and emission 430 nm corresponds to the
   fluorescence maxima for aquatic fulvic acid. Chromatograms of the river
   waters showed four peaks; each peak position was in good agreement among
   these samples. Peak height ratios for the samples from the upstream Kuji
   River and its tributaries were different from those of the midstream and
   downstream sections of the Kuji River, which may reflect differences in
   the characteristics of humic substances and other organic materials

Abstract = {{Antimony has been one of the contaminants required to be regulated,
   however, only limited information has been collected to date regarding
   antimony removal by polyaluminium chloride (PACl) and ferric chloride
   (FC). Accordingly, the possible use of coagulation by PACl or FC for
   antimony removal was investigated. Jar tests were used to determine the
   effects of solution pH, coagulant dosage, and pre-chlorination on the
   removal of various antimony species. Although high-efficiency antimony
   removal by aluminum coagulation has been expected because antimony is
   similar to arsenic in that both antimony and arsenic are a kind of
   metalloid in group V of the periodic chart, this study indicated: (1)
   removal density (arsenic or antimony removed per mg coagulant) for
   antimony by PACl was about one forty-fifth as low as observed for As(V);
   (2) although the removal of both Sb(III) and Sb(V) by coagulation with
   FC was much higher than that of PACl, a high coagulant dose of 10.5 mg
   of Fe L-1 at optimal pH of 5.0 was still not sufficient to meet the
   standard antimony level of 2 mug as Sb L-1 for drinking water when
   around 6 mug as Sb L-1 were initially present. Consequently,
   investigation of a more appropriate treatment process is necessary to
   develop economical Sb reduction; (3) although previous studies concluded
   that As(V) is more effectively removed than As(III), this study showed
   that the removal of Sb(III) by coagulation with FC was much more
   pronounced than that of Sb(V); (4) oxidation of Sb(III) with chlorine
   decreased the ability of FC to remove antimony. Accordingly, natural
   water containing Sb(III) under anoxic condition should be coagulated
   without pre-oxidation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to test the feasibility of integrating in situ,
   single species exposures and biomarker analysis into microcosm studies.
   Experimental ponds were dosed with pirimiphos methyl (PM) and lindane.
   C. riparius fourth instar larvae were deployed for 48 h on nine separate
   occasions during the study period before and after treatment. Surviving
   larvae were analysed for acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE). Survival
   and biomarker data were compared to chironomid assemblage analysis by
   monitoring insects emerging from the microcosms. Survival of chironomids
   within the in situ systems commenced on day + 16 after treatment with
   31.6\% and 53.3\% survival in the lindane and PM treated ponds,
   respectively. In contrast, the first emergence from the microcosms
   occurred on days + 27, in respect to lindane, and + 59 for the PM
   treated ponds. Thus the in situ bioassay was able to demonstrate gradual
   reduction in toxicity within the sediment before this was evident from
   macroinvertebrate monitoring. Significant ACNE inhibition was only
   detected on exposure to PM. Levels decreased from 75\% on day + 16 to
   26\% by day +29. The biomarker analysis confirmed that, by the end of
   the study, the insecticide was no longer exerting an effect. We discuss
   how the use of in situ bioassays could also aid comparison of microcosm
   studies by adding a standardized dimension. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The importance of abiotic reductive transformations as a sink for four
   dinitroaniline herbicides (trifluralin, pendimethalin, nitralin, and
   isopropalin) has been evaluated. Using reductants representative of
   abiotic reductants found in natural systems, the results of this study
   indicate that nitro groups present on the dinitroaniline herbicides can
   be reduced by surface-bound Fe(II) species in goethite suspensions or by
   hydroquinone moieties such as (mercapto)juglone in a hydrogen sulfide
   solution. Aqueous iron species are also effective at pH values above
   7.0. The reaction in aqueous Fe(II) and in Fe(II)/goethite systems is
   strongly pH dependent, with rates increasing with increasing pH.
   Montmorillonite clay, however, is not effective in mediating the
   reduction of dinitroaniline herbicides in the presence of Fe(II).
   Because the selected dinitroaniline herbicides have a mixture of
   electron withdrawing and electron donating groups, linear free energy
   relationships were developed for the H2S/(mercapto)juglone and Fe(II)/
   goethite systems. Anilines resulting from reduction of the nitro group
   as well as cyclization products (benzimidazoles) were observed in the
   degradation of trifluralin. Only one aniline product was observed for
   pendimethalin. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of changing oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and grazing of
   protozoa, on nitrifiers in activated sludge systems was investigated.
   This study used sequencing batch reactors which were acclimated under
   aerobic and alternating anoxic/aerobic conditions, with and without
   inhibition of protozoa, the predatory microorganisms. The feed used was
   a synthetic wastewater containing beef and yeast extracts as a carbon
   source. It was found that the biomass, determined by mixed liquor
   volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) in the reactors, was significantly
   affected by predation while ORP (aerobic and alternating anoxic/aerobic
   conditions) has no impact on the MLVSS regardless of the presence or
   absence of predation. However, the nitrification rates in the reactors
   show completely different trends indicating that the ORP of the system
   has a significant impact on the rates while predation does not. It was
   found that nitrification rates in alternating reactors were almost
   double the rates in the aerobic reactors, both with and without
   predatory inhibition. The decay rate of autotrophic bacteria (b(A)) in
   aerobic reactors was determined by tracking the decrease of the maximum
   nitrification rate under both anoxic and aerobic starvation conditions.
   The b(A) in alternating anoxic/aerobic reactors was also determined
   under alternating starvation conditions. It was found that, in any case,
   the alternating anoxic/aerobic autotrophic biomass b(A) was much smaller
   that the b(A) of aerobic biomass determined under aerobic and anoxic
   starvation conditions. The alternating anoxic/aerobic b(A) was 62.1 \%
   less than the aerobic biomass b(A) under aerobic starvation and 40.2\%
   less for the aerobic biomass starved under anoxic conditions. No
   statistically significant differences in b(A) were observed between
   reactors with or without the inhibition of predators. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The biological nitrogen removal (BNR) process is the most common method
   for removing low quantities of ammonium from wastewater, but this is not
   the usual treatment for high-strength ammonium wastewater. The capacity
   to biologically remove the nitrogen content of a real industrial
   wastewater with a concentration of 5000 mg N-NH4+ L-1 is demonstrated in
   this work. The experimental system used is based on a two-sludge system,
   with a nitrifying activated sludge and a denitrifying activated sludge.
   This system treated real industrial wastewater for 450 days, and during
   this period, it showed the capacity for oxidizing all the ammonium at
   average nitrification rates between 0.11 and 0.18 g N-NH4+ g VSS-1
   d(-1). Two key process parameters were evaluated: the maximum
   nitrification rate (MNR) and the maximum denitrification rate (MDR). MNR
   was determined in continuous operation at three different temperatures:
   15 degreesC, 20 degreesC and 25 degreesC, obtaining values of 0.10, 0.21
   and 0.37g N-NH4+ g VSS-1 d(-1), respectively. Complete denitrification
   was achieved using two different industrial carbon sources, one
   containing mainly ethanol and the other one methanol. The MDR reached
   with ethanol (0.64g N-NOx- g VSS-1 d(-1)) was about 6 times higher than
   the MDR reached with methanol (0.11 g N-NOx- g VSS-1 d(-1)). (C) 2003

Abstract = {{To control stormwater pollution effectively, development of innovative,
   land-use-related control strategies will be required. An approach that
   could differentiate land-use types from stormwater quality would be the
   first step to solving this problem. We propose a neural network approach
   to examine the relationship between stormwater water quality and various
   types of land use. The neural network model can be used to identify
   land-use types for future known and unknown cases. The neural model uses
   a Bayesian network and has 10 water quality input variables, four
   neurons in the hidden layer, and five land-use target variables
   (commercial, industrial, residential, transportation, and vacant). We
   obtained 92.3 percent of correct classification and 0.157
   root-mean-squared error on test files. Based on the neural model,
   simulations were performed to predict the land-use type of a known data
   set, which was not used when developing the model. The simulation
   accurately described the behavior of the new data set. This study
   demonstrates that a neural network can be effectively used to produce
   land-use type classification with water quality data. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The annual course of nitrogen removal in a stable operating subsurface
   horizontal flow constructed wetland (SSF) in a moderate climate was
   evaluated using a large pool of data from 4 years of operation. In
   spring and autumn removal efficiencies were found to depend on the
   nitrogen load in a linear mode. The efficiencies in winter and summer
   differed extremely (mean removal rates of 0.15/0.7gm(-2)d(-1)
   (11\%/53\%) in January/August) and were independent of the nitrogen load
   (0.7-1.7 g m(-2) d(-1)) in principle. Oscillations of the removal rates
   in spring, forming several maxima, suggest seasonal specific effects
   caused by the dynamics of the plant-physiology finally determining the
   nitrification efficiency, i.e. via O-2-supply. Nitrification is limited
   by temperature during all seasons and surprisingly in midsummer
   additionally restricted by other seasonal aspects forming a clear-cut
   relative nitrification minimum (mean rate of 0.43 g m(-2) d(-1) (32\%))
   in July. The importance and the effect of the plants' gas exchange and
   oxygen input into the rhizosphere are discussed. Denitrification was
   nearly complete in midsummer and was clearly restricted at seasonal
   temperatures below 15 degreesC. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In this work, we propose the use of an air segment in a sequential
   injection system to simultaneously improve the overlapping of the
   stacked zones and minimise dispersion. This strategy was developed foe
   the determination of sulphate in natural and wastewaters. Barium
   chloride was used as a precipitating agent and the turbidity of the
   suspension formed was measured at 420 nm. Analysis was performed without
   sample pre-treatment and the system was able to monitor sulphate
   concentration at a rate of at least 20 determinations per hour. Slightly
   different analytical sequences were developed for natural and
   wastewaters in order to minimise specific interferences. Direct
   determination of sulphate was possible within a concentration range of
   10-100 and 16-100 mg SO42- L-1 for natural and wastewaters,
   respectively. Results obtained were comparable with those of the
   reference method with relative deviations lower than 5\%. Relative
   standard deviations between 1.6\% and 3.3\% were found. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{This study compared the effects of ionic strength on the binding
   constants (K-doc) of selected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   (phenanthrene and pyrene) and a terrestrial humic acid (Leonardite Humic
   Acid) in different electrolyte solutions (KCl, KBr, M9Cl2 and MgSO4).
   Distinct trends were found in Kdoc variation depending upon the range of
   ionic strength resulting from added electrolytes. These trends
   demonstrated similar shapes for all the systems studied, while degree of
   variation increased with hydrophobicity of the PAHs. Furthermore;
   different types of electrolytes had different effects on the
   interactions between humic acid (HA) and the PAHs. These differences
   were primarily caused by types of cation, not anion. To describe the
   complicated effects of ionic strength on K-doc, we developed a
   three-stage variation model that encompasses increasing and decreasing
   trends and plateaus in Kdoc associated with ionic strength, as well as
   the mechanisms behind these trends, including the variation of HA
   structure configuration, HA aggregation and the salting-out effect. This
   model illustrated the importance of sufficient experimental data when
   interpreting the influence of ionic strength on the trends in Kdoc
   variation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A pre-coagulation and bio-filtration process for advanced treatment of
   sewage was developed and experimentally discussed with a pilot plant.
   The bio-filtration unit consists of a denitrification filter, a
   nitrification filter with side stream to the denitrification filter, and
   a polishing filter with anoxic and aerobic parts. Concentrations of SS,
   T-CODSCr, T-carbonaceous BOD, T-N and T-P in the effluent were stably
   kept at less than 3, 20, 5 mg/L, 2 mg N/L and 0.2 mg P/L, respectively,
   and transparency at higher than 100 cm, under total hydraulic retention
   time of 3.2h in the bio-filtration parts (filter-bed). ORP in an anoxic
   tank before a nitrification tank should be at a low level of less than
   -120 mV to keep remaining NOx--N less than 1 mg N/L, but must be
   maintained at a level higher than -150 mV. The maximum nitrogen-loading
   rate under a water temperature of 18 degreesC should be less than 0.25
   kg N/(m(3)-filter-bed (.) d). Concentrations of microorganisms kept in
   the reactors were as high as 4000-5000 mg COD/L-filter-bed.
   Denitrification activity of 0.4 or 0.7 kg N/(m(3)-filter-bed (.) d), and
   nitrification activity of 0.3 kg N/(m3-filter-bed (.) d) were obtained,
   respectively, under a water temperature of about 18 degreesC.
   Backwashing in each tank as well as methanol addition and aeration in
   the polishing filter were operated successfully by the automatic control
   systems. These results proved that this process is applicable to
   advanced treatment of sewage with easy maintenance. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The electrochemical behavior of Fe(EDTA)(-/2-) on a chitosan-coated
   glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and the determining method of the EDTA
   species in water samples by square-wave voltammetry (SWV) have been
   investigated. Fe(EDTA)(-) can be adsorbed on the positively charged
   chitosan membrane assembled on a GCE and be reduced at a potential of
   -0.095 V vs. Ag/AgCl. On the chitosan-coated GCE, the cathodic stripping
   peak current is proportional to the concentration of EDTA after the
   operating parameters of SWV were optimized. The measuring range of EDTA
   was from 2.0 x 10(-6) to 8.0 x 10(-5) mol/L with a correlation
   coefficient of r = 0.998 and a detection limit of 2.0 x 10(-7) mol/L.
   The relative standard deviation was less than 6.4\% (n = 5) and the
   recovery was in the range of 98-105\% for the determination of practical
   samples. The result was consistent with that from the HPLC method. (C)

Abstract = {{The effect of reductive treatment with elemental iron on the rate and
   extent of TOC removal by Fenton oxidation was studied for the explosives
   2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine
   (RDX) using a completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The results
   support the hypothesis that TNT and RDX are reduced with elemental iron
   to products that are oxidized more rapidly and completely by Fenton's
   reagent. Iron pretreatment enhanced the extent of total organic carbon
   (TOC) removal by approximately 20\% and 60\% for TNT and RDX,
   respectively. Complete TOC removal was achieved for TNT and RDX
   solutions with iron pretreatment under optimal conditions. On the other
   hand, without iron pretreatment, complete TOC removal of TNT and RDX
   solutions was not achieved even with much higher H2O2 and Fe2+
   concentrations. Nitrogen was recovered as NH4+ and NO3- when
   Fe(0)-treated TNT and RDX solutions were subjected to Fenton oxidation.
   The bench-scale iron treatment-Fenton oxidation integrated system showed
   more than 95\% TOC removal for TNT and RDX solutions under optimal
   conditions. These results suggest that the reduction products of TNT and
   RDX are more rapidly and completely degraded by Fenton oxidation and
   that a sequential iron treatment-Fenton oxidation process may be a
   viable technology for pink water treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water samples from the shallow
   eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, was
   fractionated and characterized by using resin adsorbents into 5 classes:
   aquatic humic substances (AHS), hydrophobic neutrals, hydrophilic acids
   (HiA), bases (BaS) and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN). Subsequently, the
   trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP), ultraviolet absorbance to
   dissolved organic carbon (UV:DOC) ratio, and molecular size distribution
   of the DOM, AHS and hydrophilic fractions (HiF) (HiF = HiA + BaS + HiN)
   were examined. The THMFP of HiF, normalized on a DOC basis; was found to
   be comparable to that of AHS (0.176 mumol THM mg C-1 vs. 0.195 mumol THM
   mg C-1, respectively). The importance of HiF over AHS as a THM precursor
   became more pronounced when THMFP was evaluated in terms of
   concentration. In this case, the THMFP of HiF was much greater than that
   of AHS (0.374 mumol THM 1(-1) vs. 0.229 mumol THM 1(-1), respectively).
   Molecular size distributions all exhibited a narrow size range and
   relatively low molecular weights. The weight-averaged molecular weights
   of DOM, AHS and HiF were 780, 957 and 606 g mol(-1), respectively. (C)

Title = {{Characterization of DOM as a function of MW by fluorescence EEM and

Abstract = {{To investigate the composition of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a
   function of apparent molecular weight (MW) by rapid analytical methods,
   high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC) was conducted with sequential on-line detectors
   consisting of UV, fluorescence, and quantitative DOC measurement.
   Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectrophotometry was used
   to select wavelengths for the HPSEC online fluorescence system. The
   chosen peak maxima locations of excitation-emission wavelengths were
   278-353 nm for protein-like substances and 337-423 nm for fulvic-like
   substances based on an analysis of EEM spectra for various samples and
   reference materials.
   This system provides quantitative and qualitative information on the
   specific MW components of DOM, including proportion of DOC (by DOC
   measurement), aromaticity (by comparison of UV and DOC measurements),
   and chemical properties (by fluorescence measurement). It further allows
   determination of organic matter characteristics (e.g., fulvic-like,
   protein-like, and polysaccharide-like substances) as a function of MW.
   Three types of samples (Irvine Ranch ground water (IRWD-GW), Barr Lake
   surface water (BL-SW), and Hawaii wastewater secondary effluent) were
   analyzed by the HPSEC-UVA-fluorescence-DOC system. These results were
   compared with fluorescence EEM for samples fractionated by HPLC-SEC. The
   DOM fraction in the high apparent MW range (over 10,000g/mol) consisted
   of polysaccharide-like substances for IRWD-GW and a mixture of
   polysaccharide-like/protein-like substances for BL-SW and wastewater
   secondary effluent. Minimal amounts of fulvic-like substances were found
   in the wastewater secondary effluent sample.
   The DOM fractions in a medium apparent MW range (5000-1000 g/mol) showed
   higher aromaticity (fulvic in character) than any other fractions for
   all samples. For the DOM fraction in the low apparent MW range (below
   680 g/mol), additional aliphatic organic matter was found in IRWD-GW,
   while BL-SW contained protein-like processes.
   DOM plays an important role in drinking water and wastewater treatment
   processes. An enhanced HPSEC technique with multiple on-line detectors
   enables a better understanding of quantitative and qualitative DOM
   properties and can help to design and optimize water/wastewater
   treatment facilities. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{NOM-facilitated transport of metal ions in aquifers: importance of

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The transport of metal ions (Al, Fe, Zn, Pb) complexed by natural
   organic matter (NOM) was investigated by column experiments. Direct
   breakthrough of metal-NOM complexes was observed after elution of one
   bed volume for Al, Fe, and Pb, but not for Zn. This observation cannot
   be understood assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium in the columns.
   Hence, a model was developed, taking into account the kinetics of the
   interactions of metal ions with NOM and the solid phase. Of all possible
   reactions during passage through the column, the dissociation of the
   metal-NOM complexes was assumed to be the rate-determining step.
   Dissociation-rate constants were determined by cationexchange
   experiments with a non-NOM-adsorbing cation-exchange resin (Chelex-100).
   These rate constants were used to predict the migration of metal-NOM
   complexes in the column experiments. Experimental and modeling results
   were in good agreement for the bivalent metal ions. Also, the model well
   predicted the pH dependence of breakthrough of trivalent metal ions and
   the differences between Al and Fe breakthrough on a qualitative basis.
   This leads to the conclusion that the dissociation kinetics of metal-NOM
   complexes is an essential parameter for the estimation of
   NOM-facilitated metal transport. However, for the trivalent metals, Al
   and Fe, the model overestimated the direct breakthrough, thus giving a
   worst case prediction of metal transport. With the help of coupling
   size-exclusion chromatography to inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry, the formation of Al-hydroxide and Fe-hydroxide colloids in
   addition to NOM complexes was detected. These colloids, which were not
   considered in the model, were partially filtered off in the column, thus
   leading to overestimation of metal breakthrough. (C) 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Continuous flow centrifugation (CFC) was used in conjunction with
   immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and immunofluorescence microscopy (IFA)
   and nested PCR to recover and detect oocysts of Cryptosporidium parvum
   and cysts of Giardia intestinalis from 10 L volumes of source water
   samples. Using a spiking dose of 100 oocysts, nine of 10 runs were
   positive by IFA, with a mean recovery of 4.4 +/- 2.27 oocysts; when
   another 10 runs were analyzed using nested PCR to the TRAP C-1 and Cp4l
   genes, nine of 10 were positive with both PCR assays. When the spiking
   dose was reduced to 10 oocysts in 10L, 10 of 12 runs were positive by
   IFA, with a mean oocyst recovery of 3.25 +/- 3.25 oocysts. When 10 cysts
   of Giardia intestinalis were co-spiked with oocysts into 10L of source
   water, five of seven runs were positive, with a mean cyst recovery of x
   = 0.85 +/- 0.7. When 10 oocysts (enumerated using a fluorescence
   activated cell sorter) were spiked into 10L volumes of tap water, one of
   10 runs was positive, with one oocyst detected. For the majority of the
   source water samples, turbidities of the source water samples ranged
   from 1.1 to 22 NTU, but exceeded 100 NTU for some samples collected when
   sediment was disturbed. The turbidities of pellets recovered using CFC
   and resuspended in 10 mL of water were very high (exceeding 500 NTU for
   the source water-derived pellets and 100 NTU for the tap water-derived
   pellets). While not as efficient as existing capsule-filtration based
   methods (i.e., US EPA methods 1622/1623), CFC and IMS may provide a more
   rapid and economical alternative for isolation of C parvum oocysts from
   highly turbid water samples containing small quantities of oocysts. (C)

   anaerobic FFB, increasing when the recirculation ratio rose from I to 6
   due to the increase in the anoxic denitrification. The influence of the
   C/N ratio of the raw wastewater over the proportion in which the
   COD-removal was carried out by oxidation in the aerobic FFB,
   methanogenesis or denitrification in the anaerobic FFB was studied. When
   the volume of the aerobic FFB became smaller than that of the anaerobic
   one the fraction of organic matter removed in the anaerobic FFB
   increased, but also the ratio between the respective volumetric rates
   (rCODan/rCODae) increased. High recirculation and low C/NO-N ratio in
   the anaerobic FFB feed favoured the denitrification to the detriment of
   the methanogenic process. Regarding nitrogen removal for nitrogen
   applied loads around 0.064 kg TKN/m(3) d the removal efficiency was of
   95\%, which decreased to 84\% for 0.14 kg TKN/m(3) d. The stability of
   the nitrification process was the controlling factor of the nitrogen
   removal. High ammonia concentration caused by high recirculation ratio,
   specially when the aerobic FFB volume was smaller, caused nitrification
   inhibition which destabilised the system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The biosolids accumulation and biodegradation of domestic wastewater
   treatment plant (DWTP) sludge by filamentous fungi have been
   investigated in a batch fermenter. The filamentous fungi Aspergillus
   niger and Penicillium cor'Vlophiluni isolated from wastewater and DWTP
   sludge was used to evaluate the treatment performance. The optimized
   mixed inoculum (A. niger and P. corylophilum) and developed process
   conditions (co-substrate and its concentration, temperature, initial pH,
   inoculum size, and aeration and agitaion rate) were incorporated to
   accelerate the DWTP sludge treatment process. The results showed that
   microbial treatment of higher strength of DWTP sludge (4\% w/w of TSS)
   was highly influenced by the liquid state bioconversion (LSB) process.
   In developed bioconversion processes, 93.8 g/kg of biosolids was
   enriched with fungal biomass protein of 30 g/kg. Enrichment of nutrients
   such as nitrogen (N'j, phosphorous (P), potassium (K) in biosolids was
   recorded in 6.2\% (w/w), 3.1 \% (w/w) and 0.15 \% (w/w) from its initial
   values of 4.8\% (w/w), 2.0\% (w/w) and 0.08\% (w/w) respectively after
   10 days of fungal treatment. The biodegradation results revealed that
   98.8\% of TSS, 98.2\% of TDS, 97.3\% of turbidity, 80.2\% of soluble
   protein, 98.8\% of reducing sugar and 92.7\% of COD in treated DWTP
   sludge supernatant were removed after 8 days of microbial treatment. The
   specific resistance to filtration (SRF) in treated sludge (1.4 x 10(12)
   m/kg) was decreased tremendously by the microbial treatment of DWTP
   sludge after 6 days of fermentation compared to untreated sample (85 x
   1012 m/kg). (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper was to examine historical physico-chemical water
   quality parameters (1990-1997) in the River Frome, East Stoke (NGR
   SY867868), in order to show both annual and seasonal (monthly) trends.
   EPCO2 (defined as the partial pressure of CO2 in natural water divided
   by the equilibrium partial pressure of CO2) levels ranged from mean
   values of 6.32 +/- 0.41 in spring/summer to 7.86 +/- 1.17 in
   autumn/winter. A decreasing trend in mean annual EpCO(2) was also
   observed. with a high of 9.61 in 1990 and a low of 5.22 in 1996. The
   variations were attributed to changes in pH, which showed an inverse
   relationship with river discharge r(2) = 0.47). Both pH and EpCO(2)
   levels were strongly linked to biological activity with increases caused
   by primary productivity. Filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) and total
   phosphorus. (TP) concentrations correlated with river discharge. The
   results showed that the majority of the phosphorus load was transported
   during storm events, which agrees with results from an export
   coefficient model predicting phosphorus loading in the Frome catchment.
   Recent River Frome monitoring campaigns using an in situ flow-injection
   (FI)-based monitor were in agreement with phosphorus concentration and
   related physico-chemical trends observed during historical sampling and
   laboratory analysis. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of temperature variations on aerobic biological wastewater
   treatment were evaluated with respect to treatment efficiency, solids
   discharges, sludge physicochemical properties and microbiology. The
   effects of controlled temperature shifts (from 35degrees to 45degreesC;
   from 45degrees to 35degreesC and periodic temperature oscillations (from
   31.5degreesC to 40degreesC, 6day period, for 30 days) were assessed in 4
   parallel, lab-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) that treated pulp
   and paper mill effluent.
   Overall, the temperature shifts caused higher effluent suspended solids
   (ESS) levels (25-100 mg/L) and a decrease (up to 20\%) in the removal
   efficiencies of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD). Lower ESS levels
   were triggered by a slow (2degreesC/day) versus a fast (10degreesC/12h)
   temperature shift from 35degrees to 45degreesC, but the SCOD removal
   efficiencies decreased similarly in both cases (from 66+/-3\% and
   65+/-2\% to 49+/-3\% and 51+/-3\%). Temperature oscillations caused an
   increased deterioration of the sludge settleability {[}high sludge
   volume indices (SVI); low zone settling velocities (ZSV)], high ESS
   levels and lower SCOD removals.
   dThe temperature transients were associated with poor sludge
   settleability (SVI > 100 mL/g MLSS, ZSV < 1 cm/min), more negatively
   charged sludge (up to -0.35 +/- 0.03 meq/g MLSS), increased filament
   abundance (similar to 4 to 4.5, subjective scale equivalent to very
   common), and decreased concentrations of protozoa and metazoa
   (25,000-50,000 microorganisms/mL sludge). The controlled, periodic
   temperature oscillations had a slight impact on SCOD removal efficiency
   (5\% decrease), and did not seem to select for robust microorganisms
   that withstood the temperature shift. Sludge deflocculation and filament
   proliferation caused by these temperature transients may explain the
   higher ESS levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the production of biodegradable plastics
   polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) by activated sludge treating municipal,
   wastewater was investigated. The effect of three operational factors,
   i.e. the acetate concentration in influent, pH, and sludge retention
   time (SRT) were studied. Sludge acclimatized with municipal wastewater
   supplemented with acetate could accumulate PHA up to 30\% of sludge dry
   weight, while sludge acclimatized with only municipal wastewater
   achieved 20\% of sludge dry weight. It was found that activated sludge
   with an SRT of 3 days possessed better PHA production capability than
   sludge with an SRT of 10 days. Sludge acclimatized under pH 7 and 8
   conditions in sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) exhibited similar PHA
   production capability. However, in PHA production batch experiments, pH
   value influenced significantly the PHA accumulation behavior of
   activated sludge. When pH of batch experiments was controlled at 6 or 7,
   a very low PHA production was observed. The production of PHA was
   stimulated when pH was kept at 8 or 9. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Microfiltration (MF) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) and soil-aquifer
   treatment (SAT) are the two principal technologies considered for
   indirect potable reuse of wastewater. This study, conducted at the
   Northwest Water Reclamation Plant, Mesa (Arizona), evaluated MF/RO and
   SAT (> 6 months residence time) treated tertiary effluent with respect
   to organics removal. Effluent organic matter was characterized as total
   organic carbon (TOC), by UV absorbance (UVA), solid-state carbon-13
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and size exclusion
   chromatography. Several trace organic micropollutants, including EDTA,
   NTA, and alkylphenolethoxylate residues, were analyzed by GC/MS. The
   study revealed that final TOC concentrations of MF/RO and SAT are 0.3
   and 1.0 mgl(-1), respectively. Based on the characterization techniques
   used, the character of bulk organics present in final SAT water
   resembles the character of natural organic matter present in drinking
   water. Depending on the molecular weight cut-off, RO membranes can
   efficiently reject high molecular weight organic matter (characterized
   as humic and fulvic acids). However, approximately 40-50 percent of the
   remaining TOC in permeates consists of low molecular weight acids and
   neutrals representing a molecular weight range of similar to 500 Da and
   less. In the SAT treated effluent, EDTA and APECs were removed to
   approximately 4.3 and 0.54 mug/l, respectively, but were below the
   detection limit in the MF/RO treated effluent. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Static mixers may be used to dissolve gaseous ozone in water treatment
   facilities in order to provide protection against the waterborne
   parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. The objective of this study was to
   determine the effect of a brief exposure to turbulent gas-liquid mixing
   conditions in a static mixer on inactivation of C parvum oocysts by
   ozone. Inactivation measured in an ozone contacting apparatus that
   employed a static mixer for ozone dissolution was compared to
   predictions based on a previously published kinetic model of C parvum
   inactivation by dissolved ozone in gently stirred batch reactors.
   Although initial contact in the static mixer had no immediate effect on
   the oocysts, a 20\% increase in the rate of inactivation during
   subsequent contact with dissolved ozone was observed. Increasing the
   degree of turbulence within the static mixer did not yield additional
   inactivation. Use of static mixers for dissolution of ozone in drinking
   water treatment systems may provide limited enhancement of C parvum
   inactivation by dissolved ozone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Activated sludge samples from seven full-scale plants were investigated
   in order to determine the relationship between floc structure and floc
   stability. Floc stability was determined by shear sensitivity and floc
   strength. Floc structure was considered in terms of two size scales, the
   micro- and macrostructure. The microstructure refers to the organization
   of the floc components, such as the individual microorganisms. The
   macrostructure refers to the overall floc. The floc macrostructure was
   characterized by filament index, sludge volume index, size, and fractal
   dimension. It had a significant impact on floc stability. Large and open
   floes with low fractal dimensions containing large number of filaments
   were more shear sensitive and had lower floc strength compared to small
   and dense floes. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis indicated
   that the organization of the bacterial cells might also have an effect
   on the floc stability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The photocatalytic activity of the catbon-black-modified nano-TiO2
   (CB-TiO2) thin films was 1.5 times higher than that of TiO2 thin films
   in degrading Reactive Brilliant Red X-3B. Photocatalytic oxidation and
   ozonation of catechol over CB-TiO2 thin films supported on Al sheet was
   investigated. The experiments showed that ozone concentrations had an
   important effect on TOC removal. The combined photocatalysis with UV
   irradiation and ozonation (TiO2/UV/ O-3) process considerably increased
   TOC removal rate compared to combined photocatalysis with UV irradiation
   and oxygen oxidation (TiO2/UV/O-2) process, ozonation alone (O-3)
   process, combined ozonation and UV irradiation (UV/ O-3) process. The
   complete mineralization of catechol followed pseudo-zero-order kinetics
   dependent upon ozone (oxygen) concentration and indicated catechol
   concentration did not affect the kinetics during UV/O-3 and TiO2/UV/O-3
   (O-2) processes. The kinetic study showed that the rate constants in the
   complete mineralization of catechol with TiO2/ UV/O-3 are 1.32-1.80
   times higher than that of UV/O-3 with the same concentration of ozone.
   The rate constants are 2.56-5.36 times higher than the maximal rate
   constants of TiO2/UV/O-2 and 4.68-9.8 times higher than the maximal rate
   constants of TiO2/UV. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the process of wastewater treatment hydrolysis of polymeric
   substances is the first and rate-limiting step. A closer study of the
   enzymes catalysing these reactions is essential for a better
   understanding of the microbial activity in the wastewater treatment
   process. Therefore, development of gentle and efficient enzyme
   extraction methods from environmental samples is very important. In this
   study we present a method for the extraction of lipases and proteases
   from activated sludge using the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100, EDTA,
   and cation exchange resin (CER), alone or in combination for the
   extraction of lipases and proteases from activated sludge. The sludge
   was continuously stirred in the presence of either buffer alone or in
   the presence of detergent and/or chelating agents. In all cases, a
   marked reduction in floc size was observed upon continuous stirring.
   However, no lipase activity and negligible protease activity was
   extracted in the presence of buffer alone, indicating that enzyme
   extraction was not due to shear force alone. The highest lipase activity
   was extracted using 0.1\% Triton X-100 above which the activity was
   gradually decreasing. For proteases, the highest activity was obtained
   in the presence of 0.5\% Triton X-100 and no decrease in activity was
   observed. Differences observed in the extraction efficiency of the two
   enzymes indicate the need for optimisation of the extraction process for
   the different enzymes or the extracellular polymeric substances from
   activated sludge. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) procedure for Irgarol 1051 (i.e.
   2-(tert-butylamino)-4-(cyclopropylamino)-6(methylthio)-1,3,5-triazine)
   determination in marine sediments, which minimises the solvent usage, is
   developed and compared to a conventional extraction technique (i.e.
   sonication). First, the use of methanol (MeOH) in the presence of
   trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as secondary modifier of supercritical carbon
   dioxide was evaluated. Extraction efficiency was strongly dependent on
   the modifier content but lesser on pressure (100-410 bar) and
   temperature (60-200degrees C). In the selected extraction conditions
   (20\% MeOH/TFA 0.65 M, 370 bar, 150degrees C) recoveries higher than
   87\% were obtained and the limit of detection was 3 ng g(-1) and the
   relative standard deviation of 10\% (N = 3) by GC coupled to mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) in the electron impact mode. The developed SFE
   procedure is more convenient to extract Irgarol 1051 than the agitation

Abstract = {{Previous classical and Bayesian formulations of compliance assessment
   rules based on a nonparametric approach are compared with formulations
   based on the assumption that compliance assessment data have been
   randomly drawn from a normal population with unknown mean and variance.
   Graphs of parametric (Bayesian) ``Confidence of Compliance{''} curves
   are presented. With one exception it is concluded that compliance rules
   based on a nonparametric approach are the more robust, as their
   formulation does not depend on any assumption as to the nature of the
   parent distribution and because rules devised under either approach are
   generally similar. The exception occurs for rules based on minimizing
   the consumer's risk (i.e., environment's risk) when a large number of
   samples are to hand and goodness of-fit tests give strong grounds for
   the assumption of a normal parent. In that case the parametric
   compliance rule-either Bayesian or classical-becomes rather less strict.

Abstract = {{The attenuation of alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEOs) metabolites was
   studied at a soil aquifer treatment (SAT) site located in Arizona, USA.
   Two parcels of water were monitored during infiltration; one parcel was
   predominantly oxic while the other was predominantly anoxic. In this
   study, only alkylphenol ethoxycarboxylates (APECs) and
   carboxyalkylphenol ethoxycarboxylates (CAPECs) were detected, no
   short-chained APEOs were observed-even under anoxic conditions. APEO
   metabolites were rapidly (< 7 days) removed under both aerobic and
   anoxic conditions. In general, the length of the ethoxycarboxylate chain
   decreases with depth-at depths greater than 3 m, only alkylphenoxy
   acetic acids (AP1ECs), carboxyalkylphenoxy acetic acids (CAP1ECs), and
   alkylphenols (APs) remain. Under aerobic conditions, octylphenol and
   nonylphenol concentrations decreased by similar to 80\% (w/w) within 3 m
   of the ground surface. Under anoxic conditions however, alkylphenol
   concentrations increased by similar to 200\% during the first 1.5 m and
   then decreased during the next 1.5 m; overall, under anoxic conditions,
   alkylphenol concentrations increased by similar to 38\% within 3 m.
   During infiltration, APEC and CAPEC concentrations decrease by more than
   95\% within 3 m of SAT. Alternate flooding and drying cycles appear to
   enhance overall APEO metabolite removal efficiencies. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The photooxidation of 2-aminophenol in aqueous solution in the presence
   of an iron(III) (hydr)oxide (goethite, alpha-FeOOH), used as a
   heterogeneous catalyst, has been investigated at different pH (3.0-8.0)
   and catalyst loads (100-500 mg/l) aiming mainly at elucidating the
   reaction kinetics. A large experimental campaign allowed to rule out the
   intervention of HO radicals in the photodegradation of 2-aminophenol.
   The classic Langmuir-Hinshelwood equation has been used for the kinetic
   analysis, best estimated values of the kinetic parameters being derived
   by means of an optimization procedure. The dependence of reaction
   kinetics on the temperature in the range of 285-308 K has also been
   investigated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The titration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by bioluminescence permits
   rapid evaluation of the quantity of viable micro-organisms present in a
   water sample. During two sampling campaigns, Societe Anonyme de Gestion
   des Eaux de Paris (SAGEP) tested a new extraction and titration system
   of bacterial ATP in the Paris drinking water distribution network. As
   far as the entire set of results of analyses of water in the network is
   concerned there is a linear relationship between log {[}ATP] and
   log(HPC-R2A/ml). Furthermore, as regards the drinking water originating
   from treatment of surface waters, some of the results obtained indicate
   a slight change as regards the Paris network in the microbiological
   quality. This is certainly linked to the distance travelled from the
   production location as well as to a reservoir effect observed on a site.
   Conversely, no change is apparent with regard to waters of underground
   origin. Lastly, despite changes in temperature and chlorine residual, no
   significant influence has been observed, essentially because of the very
   low density of culturable bacteria. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, the quenching of hydrogen peroxide by catalase, sodium
   hypochlorite, sodium thiosulfate and sodium sulfite, prior to UFC
   testing, was investigated. Sodium hypochlorite, sodium thiosulfate and
   sodium sulfite were found to be unsuitable for quenching H2O2 residuals
   because the procedures are time-consuming and complicated in that they
   require potentially multiple measurements of the peroxide and chlorine
   residuals. In contrast, quenching of peroxide with catalase is a simple
   procedure. Catalase doses of less than 0.2 mg/L were found to have no
   impact on DBP (TTHM, HAA and aldehyde) formation in the UFC test, and
   the time that was needed to quench 100 mg/L peroxide (room temperature,
   pH 8.3) was less than 10 min. In addition, peroxide was found to react
   with DPD reagents that are used to measure chlorine residuals, a
   phenomenon that may lead to falsely high chlorine residuals in the UFC
   test. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Adenoviruses are of major public health importance and are associated
   with a variety of clinical manifestations, i.e. gastroenteritis, eye
   infections and respiratory infections. The importance of water in the
   epidemiology of adenoviruses and the potential health risks constituted
   by adenoviruses in water sources and supplies are widely recognised.
   This study was conducted to assess the incidence of human adenoviruses
   in raw and treated water systems. Various raw and treated water were
   routinely monitored for the presence of adenoviruses, over a 1-year
   period (July 2000-June 2001). The supplies were derived from acceptable
   quality surface water sources using treatment processes, which conform
   to international standards for the production of safe drinking water.
   Adenoviruses were detected by firstly amplifying the viruses in cell
   cultures and then amplifying the extracted nucleic acids of these
   viruses using molecular techniques (nested PCR). The results indicated
   human adenoviruses present in 13 (12.75 \%) of the raw and 9 (4.41 \%)
   of the treated water samples tested. The combination of cell culture and
   nested PCR has proved to be a quick and reliable method for the
   detection of adenoviruses in water environments. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Precipitation of Zn2+ with S2- was studied at room temperature in a
   continuously stirred tank reactor of 0.51 to which solutions of ZnSO4
   (800-5800 mg(-1) Zn2+) and Na2S were supplied. The pH was controlled at
   6.5 and S2- concentration in the reactor was controlled at set point
   values ranging from 3.2 x 10(-19) to 3.2 x 10(-4) mg l(-1), making use
   of an ion-selective S2- electrode. In steady state, the mean particle
   size of the ZnS precipitate decreased linearly from 22 to 1 mum for S2-
   levels dropping from 3.2 x 10(-4) to 3.2 x 10(-18) mg l(-1). At 3.2 x
   10(-11) Mg l(-1) of S2-, the supplies of ZnSO4 and Na2S solutions were
   stoichiometric for ZnS precipitation. At this S2- level, removal of
   dissolved zinc was optimal with effluent zinc concentration < 0.03 mg
   l(-1) while ZnS particles formed with a mean geometric diameter of about
   10 mum. Below 3.2 x 10(-11) mg l(-1) of S2- insufficient sulfide was
   added for complete zinc precipitation. At S2- levels higher than 3.2 x
   10(-11) mg l(-1) the effluent zinc concentration increased due to the
   formation of soluble zinc sulfide complexes as confirmed by chemical

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out on clindamycin's separation and recovery
   from clindamycin fermentation wastewater with nanofiltration (NF)
   membranes. Four types of flat-sheet NF membranes, DLNF-1, NTR-7250,
   XCNF-1 and MPF-44, were tested under different dynamic operating
   conditions. It was found that the operating pressure and solute
   concentration had great influence on membrane performance while flow
   rates (or velocities) had little influence on membrane performance.
   Experiments on SO42- rejection were conducted with such four flat-sheet
   NF membranes because SO42- had bad influence on microbes in biochemical
   process following the NF process. The results indicated that DLNF-1 and
   MPF-44 membranes had higher SO42- rejection among four membranes. Two
   spiral membranes, MPS-44 (1.4 m(2)) and DLNF2-30 (0.24 m(2)), were
   adopted in a concentrating process for clindamycin's separation and
   recovery from clindamycin fermentation wastewater under laboratory
   conditions. After being operated for 60 h, clindamycin wastewater was
   concentrated from 266 to 26 L, and the clindamycin was concentrated from
   220 to 1940 mg/L, which met the demand of reuse. This research may widen
   the application of NF membranes in disposal of pharmaceutical
   wastewater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a potent carcinogen formed during
   chloramination of water and wastewater treatment plant effluents. A
   procedure is described for quantifying the concentration of the organic
   precursors of NDMA that could be formed during chlorination of
   wastewaters and natural waters. The method involves applying a high dose
   of monochloramine to a pH-buffered sample followed by a 10-day contact
   period, during which the monochloramine decays at a rate unrelated to
   the composition of the sample. Analyses of samples of municipal
   wastewater effluents and surface waters indicate that the method
   provides a robust and reproducible measurement of NDMA precursors over a
   wide range of conditions. A sensitive GC/CI/MS/MS analytical procedure
   for dimethylamine also is described and used to demonstrate that NDMA
   formation during chlorination of wastewater and natural waters cannot be
   explained by dimethylamine concentrations alone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The binding of Cu2+ and Ca2+ to a fulvic acid (FA), simulating naturally
   occurring conditions, was studied. Furthermore, copper-FA complexation
   in the presence and absence of calcium was compared. For this,
   potentiometric titrations were carried out using a solution of FA at a
   concentration of 100 mg L-1, and of ionic strength 0.1 M. The Ca2+-FA
   complexation reaction was carried out at pH 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 and the
   Cu2+-FA complexation reaction at pH 5.5 and 6.5, in both the presence
   and absence of calcium ion. The calcium ion had a significant effect on
   copper binding at {[}Ca2+] greater than or equal to 2.5 x 10(-3) M. The
   experimental binding curves were analyzed using non-electrostatic
   discrete site and continuous distribution models. Competition by the
   calcium ion mainly affected the maximum binding capacity of the CU2+-FA
   complexation, whereas the slight effect observed on the binding constant
   appears to indicate that calcium only competes for specific copper
   sites, thus modifying the binding sites distribution function. It was
   also found that the number of sites occupied by the copper ion
   represented only 20\% of the total concentration of acid groups ionized
   on FA at the pH values studied. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Methyl-tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), an additive used to oxygenate
   gasoline, has been detected in lakes in northwestern New Jersey. This
   occurrence has been attributed to the use of gasoline-powered
   watercraft. This paper documents and explains both seasonal and daily
   variations in MTBE concentrations at Cranberry Lake. During a recent
   boating season (late April to September 1999), concentrations of MTBE
   typically exceeded 20 mug/L. MTBE concentrations varied daily from 12 to
   24 mug/L over a 2-week period that included the Labor Day holiday.
   Concentrations were highest on weekends when there is more boat traffic,
   which had an immediate effect on MTBE mass throughout the lake. MTBE
   concentrations decreased to about 2 mug/L shortly after the end of the
   summer recreational season. The loss of MTBE can be accounted for by
   volatilization, with a half-life on the order of 10 days. The
   volatilization rate was modeled with the daily decrease in MTBE then the

Abstract = {{A combined bioelectrochemical and sulfur autotrophic denitrification
   process for drinking water treatment was put forward and investigated
   extensively in this paper. In this new process, the bioelectrochemical
   denitrification was carried out in the upper part of the reactor while
   sulfur denitrification in the lower part. The H+ produced in Sulfur Part
   could be consumed by hydrogen denitrification in Bioelectrochemical
   Part. Therefore, the limestone for pH adjustment in Sulfur Part was not
   necessary in this combined process, which avoided the problem of
   hardness increase. The sulfate accumulation in this combined reactor was
   less than that of the sulfur limestone autotrophic denitrification
   system. The effluent from two parts was kept neutral at optimum
   operation conditions. When the influent nitrate was 30 mg-N/L, the
   reactor could be operated efficiently at the hydraulic retention time
   ranged from 1.9 to 5 h (corresponding minimum current was 16-3 mA), i.e.
   the effluent NO3--N removal ranged from 90\% to 100\% without nitrite
   accumulation and the effluent sulfate concentration was lower than 170
   mg/L. The maximum volume-loading rate of the reactor was 0.381 kg
   NO3--N/(m(3) d). The biomass and scanning electron microscope
   micrographs of Sulfur Part were also analyzed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Discoloration and mineralization of Reactive Red HE-3B were studied by
   using a laponite clay-based Fe nanocomposite (Fe-Lap-RD) as a
   heterogeneous catalyst in the presence of H2O2 and UV light. Our
   experimental results clearly indicate that Fe-Lap-RD mainly consists of
   Fe2O3 (meghemite) and Fe2Si4O10(OH)2 (iron silicate hydroxide) which
   have tetragonal and monoclinic structures, respectively, and has a high
   specific surface area (472m(2) / g) as well as a high total pore volume
   (0.547 cm(3)/g). It was observed that discoloration of HE-3B undergoes a
   much faster kinetics than mineralization of HE-3B. It was also found
   that initial HE-3B concentration, H2O2 concentration, UV light
   wavelength and power, and Fe-Lap-RD catalyst loading are the four main
   factors that can significantly influence the mineralization of HE-3B. At
   optimal conditions, complete discoloration of 100 mg/L HE-3B can be
   achieved in 30 min and the total organic carbon removal ratio can attain
   76\% in 120 min, illustrating that Fe-Lap-RD has a high photo-catalytic
   activity in the photo-assisted discoloration and mineralization of HE-3B
   in the presence of UV light (254nm) and H2O2. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Sorption and degradation of the five selected endocrine disrupting
   chemicals (EDCs) including bisphenol A (BPA), 17beta-estradiol (E2),
   17alpha-ethynylestradiol (EE2), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-t-OP) and
   4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP) have been investigated in the laboratory using
   sediment and groundwater from an aquifer in Bolivar, South Australia.
   The sorption coefficients measured on the sediment were in the following
   order: 4-n-NP > 4-t-OP > EE2 > E2 > BPA. The sorption coefficients (K-f
   values) for the five EDCs were 3.89, 21.8, 24.2, 90.9 and 195,
   respectively. The alkylphenols 4-t-OP and 4-n-NP had strong binding on
   the sediment while BPA had a weak affinity. Degradation experiments of
   the five EDCs showed that E2 and 4-n-NP degraded quickly under aerobic
   conditions with a half-life of 2 and 7 days, respectively. EE2 degraded
   slowly with an estimated half-life of 81 days in the aquifer material
   under aerobic conditions while the other two chemicals (BPA and 4-t-OP)
   remained almost unchanged. Little or no degradation of the five EDCs
   except slow degradation for E2 was observed within 70 days under
   anaerobic conditions in native groundwater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands (CWs) can be used to mitigate non-point source
   pollution from arable fields. Previous investigations have shown that
   the relative soil particle retention in small CWs increases when
   hydraulic load increases. This paper investigates why this phenomenon
   occurs, even though common retention models predict the opposite, by
   studying clay and silt particle retention in two Norwegian CWs.
   Retention was measured with water flow proportional sampling systems in
   the inlet and outlet of the wetlands, and the texture of the suspended
   solids was analyzed. The surface area of the CWs was small compared to
   the watershed area (approximately 0.07\%), giving high average hydraulic
   loads (1.1 and 2.0 m d(-1)). One of the watersheds included only old
   arable land, whereas the other included areas with disturbed topsoil
   after artificial land leveling. Clay particle retention was 57\% for the
   CW in the first watershed, and 22\% for the CW in the disturbed
   watershed. The different behavior of the wetlands could be due to
   differences in aggregate size and stability of the particles entering
   the wetlands. Results showed that increased hydraulic loads did affect
   CW retention negatively. However, as runoff increased, soil
   particles/aggregates with higher sedimentation velocities entered the
   CWs (e.g., the clay particles behaved as silt particles). Hence, clay
   particle settling velocity is not constant as assumed in many prediction
   models. The net result was increased retention. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper, the biodegradation process of 4-nitrophenol (4NP) in a
   sequencing batch reactor has been investigated. Kinetic tests have been
   carried out on biomass grown on mixed substrate (4NP plus biogenic
   substrate) both in the presence of a biogenic substrate fraction in the
   feed and with 4NP as the sole carbon source. Removal kinetics for all
   tests is well described by the typical substrate inhibition pattern as
   predicted by the Haldane equation. In both sets, estimated kinetic
   parameters are very similar: no beneficial effect of the biogenic
   fraction is observed on the 4NP removal while increasing trend of 4NP
   maximum removal rate with the 4NP/CODTOT ratio in the feed has been
   observed. This finding has been modelled by estimating the fraction of
   the total biomass involved in 4NP biodegradation as a function of 4NP
   concentration in the feed.
   High removal rates, short acclimation times and good settling
   characteristics of produced sludge (observed during the whole working
   period) confirm the suitability of periodic systems in enhancing the
   bacterial potentialities for biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel composite reactor was prepared and studied towards the
   degradation of organic pollutants in this work. In the reactor, a UV
   lamp was installed to provide energy to excite nano TiO2, which served
   as photocatalyst, leading to the production of hole-electron pairs, and
   a three-electrode electrolysis system was used to accumulate H2O2 which
   played an important role in the degradation process. The reactor was
   evaluated by the degradation process of rhodamine 6G (R-6G), and the
   data obtained in the experiments showed that the combination of the
   photochemical and electrochemical system raised the degradation rate of
   R-6G greatly; the working mechanism of the reactor was also discussed in
   the article. The prepared reactor was also utilized to treat polluted
   water from dyeing and printing process. After continuous treatment for
   0.5 h, chemical oxygen demand biochemical oxygen demand, quantity of
   bacteria and ammonia nitrogen of the polluted water were reduced by
   93.9\%, 87.6\%, 99.9\% and 67.5\%, respectively, which indicated that
   the method used here could be used for effective organic dyes
   degradation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past few decades classic and contemporary research on the
   process of secondary clarification in activated sludge plants has
   illuminated several aspects of the solids-flux theory which actually
   require a closer examination. Inter alia the most challenging and
   controversial part in the field has been the development of reliable
   models for the settling properties of the activated sludge in the
   settler. Numerous studies have been performed aiming at the evolvement
   of reliable mathematical formulas that would satisfactorily describe
   this behaviour, but no universally accepted solution seems to exist to
   date. That is mostly because different experimental conditions, sludge
   types and instrumentation have been employed, thus complicating the
   process of reaching a conclusive result. In order to bring theoretical
   and practical developments of secondary settling tank design and
   simulation closer together, a number of related tasks are addressed in
   this study by the use of an integrated and unified settling
   characteristics database. Several drawbacks and advantages of the
   methodologies published hitherto are examined on a universal basis and
   under the same assumptions in order to reveal artifacts that complicate
   the procedure of settling velocity estimation. It is suggested that
   universally accepted solutions may be feasible especially for design
   purposes. For simulation analysis real-time data of settling velocity
   should be tested rather than values derived from laboratory experiments
   which are shown to produce different results depending on the applied
   approach. In conclusion, an integrated database is proposed as a means
   for a more robust and universally accepted design procedure. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A new method was developed for separation and quantification of
   nitrosamines by micellar electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEKC).
   The effects of composition of the buffer, concentration of sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS), gamma-cyclodextrin (CD) and pH on the separation
   and migration times of the nitrosamines were investigated. The different
   instrumental variables affecting sensitivity and resolution, such as
   power supply, injection mode and wavelength for measurement, were
   carefully optimized. The direct application of this method to aqueous
   synthetic samples allowed the separation and determination of
   nitrosamine mixtures at the mgL(-1) level. The calibration curves
   revealed a linear range between 0.25 and 10mgL(-1), with detection limit
   (DL) varying from 0.16 to 0.27mgL(-1), quantification limit (QL)
   varyingfrom 0.52 to 0.90mgL(-1), and RSD relative standard deviation
   (RSD) from 4.5\% to 8.5\%. The proposed method was successfully applied
   to the determination of dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), diethylnitrosamine
   (DEN), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and
   N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial strains, characterized by increased tolerance and ability to
   grow in metal bearing wastewaters as well as by effective metal
   sequestering capability by both active (bioaccumulative) and passive
   (biosorptive) processes, were tested as inoculum for metal laden
   wastewater treatment systems. Their capacity to grow in metal bearing
   wastewater, using an easily available and inexpensive carbon source such
   as acetate, was studied in batch experiments. Two principal conclusions
   were drawn: (1) Growth was observed for all the strains examined
   suggesting that the strains can be acclimated to metals bearing
   wastewaters. (2) Solution pH increased from neutral to alkaline values
   during growth (pH(initial) = 7, pH(final) = 10). The later was observed
   systematically for all strains. Metal precipitation, due to the
   metabolically generated alkalinity is expected as a result.
   Supporting evidence for this hypothesis was provided during the
   operation of two pilot moving bed sand filters treating two different
   metal bearing wastewaters. Acetate was used as carbon source to support
   the growth and maintenance of microbial biomass on the sand grains of
   the filters. The characteristics of the sludge produced from the
   operation of the pilot plants were subsequently studied in the
   laboratory. Both sludges were significantly loaded with large amounts of
   metals.
   A mechanism of metal precipitation induced by the metabolically
   generated alkalinity, when acetate is used as carbon source, could be
   proposed as the main process responsible for the metals sequestering
   inside the moving bed sandfilter reactor. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Modification of a conventional activated sludge process by inserting a
   sludge holding tank in a sludge return line forms an
   oxic-settling-anaerobic (OSA) process that may provide a cost-effective
   way to reduce excess sludge production in activated sludge processes. In
   this paper we systematically evaluate the following possible scenarios
   that may explain the reduction of excess sludge in the OSA process: (i)
   energy uncoupling, (ii) domination of slow growers, (iii) soluble
   microbial products (SMPs) effect and (iv) sludge decay in the sludge
   holding tank under a low oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) condition.
   Results show that only the final scenario may reasonably explain this
   reduction. It has also been found that the sludge decay process in the
   sludge holding tank may involve the reduction of the cell mass. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{In order to achieve stable groundwater levels, an equilibrium between
   the use of groundwater for drinking water production and natural or
   artificial groundwater recharge by infiltration is needed. Local
   governments usually require that the composition of the water used for
   artificial recharge is similar to the surface water that is naturally
   present in the specific recharge area. In this paper, electrodialysis
   (ED) and nanofiltration were evaluated as possible treatment
   technologies for surface water from a canal in Flanders, the North of
   Belgium, in view of infiltration at critical places on heathlands. Both
   methods were evaluated on the basis of a comparison between the water
   composition after treatment and the composition of local surface waters.
   The treatment generally consists of a tuning of pH and the removal of
   contaminants originating from industrial and agricultural activity,
   e.g., nitrates and pesticides. Further evaluation of the influence of
   the composition of the water on the characteristics of the artificial
   recharge, however, was not envisaged. In a case study of water from the
   canal Schoten-Dessel, satisfactory concentration reductions of Cl-,
   SO42-, NO3-, HCO3-, Na+, Mg2+, K+ and Ca2+ were obtained by
   ultrafiltration pretreatment followed by ED. Nanofiltration with UTC-20,
   N30F, Desal 51 HL, UTC-60 and Desal 5 DL membranes resulted in an
   insufficient removal level, especially for the monovalent ions. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{An improved method for the determination of phosphorus in natural
   waters, aquatic organisms and sediments by ignition method is proposed.
   The recoveries of phosphorus (P) from selected inorganic and organic
   P-containing compound standards after ignition with different
   auxiliaries, such as MgSO4, Mg(NO3)(2), MgO2, Mg(Ac-2) and CaCl2, were
   compared. We found that the phosphorus from most compound standards
   could not be completely recovered when these compounds were ignited
   (450-500degreesC) with the MgSO4 as auxiliary and the baked residue was
   extracted with 0.2 mol l(-1) HCl for 30min at 80degreesC or at room
   temperature. P recoveries, for example, were poor, less than 85\%, if
   pyrophosphate and metaphosphate were ignited with the addition Of MgSO4
   prior to the extraction of the baked residue with 0.2 mol l(-1) HCl at
   80degreesC for 30 min. In contrast, MgO2, Mg(Ac)(2) and CaCl2, as well
   as Mg(NO3)(2), could all yield complete P recoveries at routine ashing
   temperatures (450-500degreesC). The results demonstrate that MgC12 is a
   more effective auxiliary agent for the determination of phosphorus in
   natural waters, aquatic organisms and sediments by ignition method than
   MgSO4 which is commonly used. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A study is made of the use of a steel-making by-product (rolling mill
   scale) as a material for removing Cu2+ ions from aqueous solutions. The
   influence of contact time, initial copper ion concentration and
   temperature on removal capability is considered. The removal of Cu2+
   ions from an aqueous solution involves two processes: on the one hand,
   the adsorption of Cu2+ ions on the surface of mill scale due to the iron
   oxides present in the latter; and on the other hand, the cementation of
   Cu2+ onto metallic iron contained in the mill scale. Rolling mill scale
   is seen to be an effective material for the removal of copper ions from
   aqueous solutions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a German sewage treatment plant that processes 200,000m(3) wastewater
   per day, the concentrations of 2,4,4'trichloro, 2'-hydroxy-phenylether
   (triclosan) in the in-flowing (similar to1000ng l(-1)) as well as in the
   out-flowing water (similar to 50 ng l(-1)) are compared to the
   concentrations measured in sludge (1200 ng g(-1)). Considering the mass
   flow of water and sludge in the respective plant, balances including
   water and sludge are calculated. Thirty percent of the triclosan is
   sorbed with weak bonds to the sludge, while some amounts are sorbed as
   bound residues in the sludge. About 5\% is dissolved in the out-flowing
   water. Thus most of the in-flowing material is not recovered as the
   parent compound but it is likely that it is transformed to other
   metabolites or unrecovered bound residues. These data are compared to
   the monitoring of sewage sludge of 20 different plants in this region,
   most of which are smaller, though. The concentrations found in these
   sludges vary from 1000-8000 ng g(-1). (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Pleurotus ostreatus grown in bioreactor batch cultures in a model
   phenolic wastewater (diluted and sterilized olive oil mill
   wastewater-OMW), caused significant phenolic removal. Laccase, the sole
   ligninolytic enzyme detected in the growth environment, was produced
   during primary metabolic growth. The bioprocess was simulated with the
   aid of a mathematical model and the parameters of growth were
   determined. When the fungal biomass was increased in the reactor (during
   repeated batch experiments) the rate of reducing sugars consumption
   progressively increased, but a phenolic fraction seemed of being
   strongly resistant to oxidation. The toxicity of OMW against the seeds
   of Lepidium sativum and the marine Branchiopoda Artemia sp. was
   significantly decreased after biotreatment. On the contrary, the
   toxicity against the freshwater Branchiopoda Daphnia magna was not
   affected by the treatment, whereas on the soil and freshwater sediments
   Ostracoda Heterocypris incongruens was slightly decreased. Both treated
   and untreated OMWs, used as water for irrigation of lettuce and tomato
   plants, did not significantly affect the uptake of several nutrients by
   the cultivated plants, but resulted in a decrease in the plant yields,
   which was minimized when high OMW dilutions were used. As a conclusion,
   P. ostreatus is able to reduce phenolic content and toxicity of
   sterilized OMW, in bioreactor cultures. However, high OMW dilutions
   should be used, and/or additional treatment should be applied before use
   of the OMW in the environment, e.g. as water for irrigation. Further
   research should be done in order to transfer this technology under
   industrial conditions (e.g. by using unsterilized OMW). (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Adsorption is a method for removing lead from wastewater. The adsorption
   of lead on a new adsorbent synthesized from natural condensed tannin has
   been investigated using a series of batch adsorption experiments. The
   study on the adsorption mechanism indicates that the adsorbent performed
   in aqueous solutions as an ionic exchanger whose end group was sodium
   ion (Na+). One lead (II) ion (Pb2+) was adsorbed onto the adsorbent by
   taking the place of two Na+ ions. The maximum exchangeable Na+ present
   on the adsorbent was measured with the proton titration experiments and
   it was up to 1.0 mmol Na+ g(-1) dry adsorbent. To a significant extent,
   pH influenced the extraction of lead from aqueous solutions. The lead
   removal efficiency was up to 71\%, 87\% and 91\% with initial solution
   pH at 3.0, 3.6 and 4.2, respectively. The Langmuir equation fitted the
   adsorption isotherm data well. The maximum adsorption capacity of lead
   calculated was 57.5, 76.9 and 114.9 mg lead g(-1) dry adsorbent at
   initial solution pH of 3.0, 3.6 and 4.2, respectively. Therefore, the
   adsorbent does offer favorable characteristics in lead removal from
   acidic wastewater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Petroleum solvents and terpenic compounds accounted for 79\% of the
   influent analyte concentration. VOC concentration in influent was
   clearly higher for most VOCs from 12 to 22h (high organic load hours),
   and lower from 24 to 10 h (lower organic load). Differences between time

Abstract = {{A mathematical model was formulated that will facilitate the prediction
   of solar disinfection by analyzing the effect of sunlight exposure
   (x(1)) and the load of bacterial contamination (x(2)), as predictor
   variables, on the efficiency of solar disinfection (y). Aliquots of 0.1
   ml containing average numbers of E coli, ranging between 1 and 5 x 10(3)
   cells/ml raw water, were introduced into each of the 96 wells of
   polystyrene microtitre plates. Plates, with the lid on, were exposed to
   sunlight for varying exposures ranging between 1.04 x 10(3) and 8.40 x
   10(3) kJ m(-2). Double strength nutrient broth was then added. After 48
   h incubation wells containing visible contamination were considered as
   containing one cell or more that survived the exposure. Data showed that
   disinfection is dependent both on the load of bacterial contamination
   and sunlight exposure. This relationship is characterized by curves
   having shoulders followed by a steep decline and then tailing off in an
   asymptotic fashion. The shoulder size increased with the increase of the
   contamination load, however, the slope remains the same. Statistical
   analysis indicates a positive correlation among the variables (R-2 =
   0.893); the mathematical model, y = 1 - (1 - e(-kx1))(x2), represents
   the relationship, with k being the solar inactivation constant. The
   exposure required to produce a given decontamination level can be
   predicted using the equation: x(1) = -1/k/n{[}1- (1-y)
   (-1)/(x2)]e(-mu/p.m/A), where mu is the linear attenuation coefficient
   (m(-1)), rho is the density, m is the mass and A is the area of the
   exposed part of the sample. The predictor variables (x(1), x(2))
   strongly influence the efficiency of solar disinfection, which can be
   predicted using the suggested mathematical model. The present data
   provides a means to predict the efficiency of solar disinfection as an
   approach to improve the quality of drinking water mainly in developing
   countries with adequate sunshine all year-round. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A model is developed to study the phosphorus dynamics in aquatic
   sediments and to conduct dynamic predictions of phosphorus release
   across a sediment-water interface. The model focuses on the sediment
   active layer below the sediment-water interface and is based on primary
   mechanisms regulating phosphorus behavior in sediments, including
   effective diffusion, bioturbation mixing and burial processes
   (transport), organic decomposition, sorption kinetic processes and
   non-linear partitioning (mobilization). The effects of environmental
   factors such as dissolved oxygen and temperature are taken into account.
   The model is solved by numerical integration.
   The primary difference from models in the literature is that the model
   directly describes the dynamic behavior of dissolved, particulate
   exchangeable ortho-phosphorus and organic phosphorus in sediments, and
   incorporates dynamic sorption and non-linear partitioning processes.

Abstract = {{A sediment phosphorus model, describing dynamics of organic phosphorus,
   dissolved reactive phosphorus and exchangeable particulate phosphorus,
   is applied to five monitoring stations in Chesapeake Bay, USA, to
   examine model performance in predicting sediment-water phosphorus
   exchange. The model was fit to I year of field measurements, and
   verified over 3 years at five sampling stations. The results show that
   the simulated concentrations of phosphorus reasonably correspond to
   model mechanisms and field observations in both spatial and temporal
   variations. Predicted release fluxes of phosphorus are consistent with
   field measurements and improved over those obtained by existing sediment
   phosphorus models. The model incorporates the effects of dissolved
   oxygen and non-linear, non-equilibrium sediment sorption in phosphorus
   dynamics. A sensitivity analysis indicates the importance of the
   non-linear, non-equilibrium sorption processes to accurate prediction of
   sediment-water phosphorus flux. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Adsorption of water soluble lead on polymetallic sea nodule has been
   studied in detail. Complete decontamination of lead is possible by
   appropriate sea nodule dosing. Adsorption is also dependent on pH and
   best adsorption is achieved at pH 6. Beyond pH 6, the desorption of lead
   from sea nodule surface is practically zero. Residual metal
   concentrations in the filtrate after adsorption is negligible. Both
   Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms may reasonably explain adsorption of
   lead on sea nodule. Chemically bound moisture plays a very crucial role
   in lead adsorption. Lead adsorptive capability of sea nodule is
   practically destroyed when calcined at a temperature of 900degreesC.
   Lead loading capacity of sea nodule has been estimated at 440 mg of lead
   per gram of sea nodule. The performance of sea nodule as a lead
   adsorbent has been successfully tested over six simulated lead
   contaminated water systems. Lead loading capacity of sea nodule compares
   favorably with other adsorbents like activated carbon, ion exchange
   resin, anionic clay, granulated blast furnace slag and natural and
   treated zeolites. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biosorption of Cr3+, Cu2+ and Cd2+ from binary metal solutions onto peat
   in the batch systems was investigated at pH 4. The order of maximum
   uptake was Cr greater than or equal to Cu > Cd and maximum uptake levels
   of ca. 0.4 mmol/g were observed for chromium and copper while cadmium
   was taken up to a maximum of ca. 0.2 mmol/g. Co-ion competition resulted
   in up to 70 percent decrease of primary metal uptake.
   A novel approach to multicomponent sorption modelling involving
   regression to the total metal taken up was adopted. Two extended
   Langmuir-type models were found to exhibit good fit to the experimental
   data. Using the simpler model of these, three-dimensional sorption
   surfaces were generated which describe the metal uptake as a function of
   equilibrium concentrations of both metals. These methods allow
   prediction of metal uptakes over a continuum of concentrations of both
   metals in binary systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Potential fecal contamination of sand in the wave-washed zone of public
   bathing beaches is overlooked in beach monitoring programs. Activity in
   this zone can bring pathogens to the sand surface or into the water,
   presenting a health risk to sensitive populations. On a unit weight
   basis (colony forming units per 100g), the mean summer abundance of the
   fecal indicator bacteria enterococci and Escherichia coli was 3-38 times
   higher in the top 20 cm of wet-sand cores than in the water column at
   six freshwater bathing beaches. E coli were 4 times more abundant than
   enterococci in water but counts were similar in the sand. A correlation
   (r = 0.60) existed between E coli counts in the water and in the top 5
   cm of sand only, whereas no relationship existed between enterococci
   abundance in water and sand. In general, enterococci were most numerous
   in the 5-10 cm sand stratum and E coli in the 0-5 cm stratum. These
   preliminary data show that wet freshwater beach sand is a reservoir of
   fecal indicator bacteria. Enteric pathogens may also be present in beach
   sand. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, Ph2+ and Cd2+ adsorption onto a natural
   polysaccharide has been studied in membrane reactors. The process
   involves a stirred semi-batch reactor for the adsorption step and a
   microfiltration (MF) process in order to confine the particles. Due to
   their lower affinity for the biosorbent, Cd2+ ions were found to
   breakthrough the process faster than Pb2+ cations. The experimental
   results showed the technical feasibility of the pilot. A mass balance
   model based on the Langmuir equilibrium isotherm was used to describe
   the adsorption process. This relation is able to predict experimental
   data under different operating conditions: the adsorbent and metal
   concentrations, and the permeate flow rate. Based on these results, it
   is demonstrated that the biosorbent studied represents an interesting
   low-cost solution for the treatment of metal ions polluted waters. (C)

Abstract = {{Photocatalytic degradation (PCD) of several aqueous pollutants was

   TiO2 using silica significantly enhances the PCD rate of the cationic
   pollutants. The rate enhancement decreased with an increase in substrate
   concentration, especially for the quaternary amines, and was attributed
   to the decrease in initial adsorption. However, no significant
   rate-increase resulted for acetate and phenol. Results suggest that the
   increased presence of cationic pollutants at the catalyst surface caused

Abstract = {{A design method for the removal of atrazine (ATZ) by catalytic oxidation
   process (COP) was developed though examination of the reaction kinetics
   in various conditions. The reaction kinetics of ATZ decay in COP are
   found to consist of a reaction and a stagnant stage, while two
   characteristic constants, the initial decay rate and the oxidative
   capacity of the COP, are successfully derived and used to describe the
   two stages, respectively. The proposed model and the way to solve the
   two characteristic constants (the initial decay rate and the oxidative
   capacity) are capable of describing the ATZ degradation precisely in COP
   at different Fe(II) concentrations and {[}Fe(II)]/{[}H2O2] ratios, where
   the marginal {[}Fe(II)]/{[}ATZ] ratio at 10 is found to be the critical
   point to achieve a cost-effective treatment of ATZ by COP. A series of
   equations for practical completely mixed batch reactor design is also
   developed based on the two characteristic constants. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Previous studies of the biosorption of halogenated aromatic pollutants
   (HAPs) have focused on the sorption of these compounds by cell bodies.
   However, in this study we investigated the adsorption of HAPs by
   biocompounds released from a bacterium, Bacillus pumilus. When B.
   pumilus was exposed to high temperature, it released a protein and
   carbohydrates, exclusively. After determining experimental conditions
   using 1,2,3,4-tetrachlorinated dibenzofuran (1,2,3,4-TCDF), the
   adsorption characteristics of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and
   dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlorinated
   benzenes, and chlorinated naphthalenes were investigated. These HAPs
   were adsorbed considerably not only by cells but also by the released
   protein. In general, highly chlorinated congeners were adsorbed to a
   greater extent on the protein than lowly chlorinated ones, and the
   amount adsorbed differed between isomers. The present results are
   consistent with adsorption occurring via a passive physico-chemical
   mechanism. Finally, the importance of biocompounds released or excreted
   from microorganisms for the removal of HAPs is discussed. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Biofilm samples from a carbonaceous trickling filter (TF) were evaluated
   in bench scale reactors to determine their maximum potential
   denitrification rates. Intact, undisturbed biofilms were placed into 0.6
   L bench-scale reactors filled with sterilized, primary clarifier
   effluent spiked with nitrate to a final concentration of 16-18 mg/L as
   N. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were maintained between 2 and 4 mg/L
   in the bulk aqueous phase. Nitrate loss from the reactors was monitored
   over a 5 h period. Denitrification rates of 3.09-5.55 g-N/m(2) day were
   observed with no initial lag period. This suggests that the capacity for
   denitrification is inherent in the biofilm and that denitrification can
   take place even when oxygen is present in the bulk aqueous phase. There
   were no significant differences in denitrification rates per unit area
   of media (g-N/m(2) day) either between (a) experimental runs or (b)
   sampling locations over the trickling filter. This suggests that
   denitrification potentials are uniform over the entire volume of the
   full-scale TF. For wastewater treatment plants with TFs that currently
   nitrify downstream, this approach may be used to meet less stringent
   permitted discharge concentrations and may allow some facilities to
   postpone or eliminate construction of additional unit processes for
   denitrification. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A promising process for the removal of heavy metal ions from aqueous
   solutions involves bonding the metals firstly to a special bonding agent
   and then separating the loaded bonding agents from the wastewater stream
   by separation processes. For the separation stage, a new hybrid process
   of flotation and membrane separation has been developed in this work by
   integrating specially designed submerged microfiltration modules
   directly into a flotation reactor. This made it possible to combine the
   advantages of both flotation and membrane separation while overcoming
   the limitations. The feasibility of this hybrid process was proven using
   powdered synthetic zeolites as bonding agents. Stable fluxes of up to
   801m(-2)h(-1) were achieved with the ceramic flat-sheet multi-channel
   membranes applied at low transmembrane pressure (<100 mbar). The process
   was applied in lab-scale to treat wastewater from the electronics
   industry. All toxic metals in question, namely copper, nickel and zinc,
   were reduced from initial concentrations of 474, 3.3 and 167 mg l(-1),
   respectively, to below 0.05 mg l(-1), consistently meeting the discharge
   limits. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of a heavy storm of rain on the composition of natural
   organic matter (NOM) in Nagara River water were studied in terms of
   molecular weights (MWs) and activated carbon (AC) adsorbabilities using
   six water samples collected during a critical Typhoon weather condition.
   The composition in MWs was analyzed using a HPSEC system and that in
   adsorbabilities was characterized using parameters devised to reflect
   NOMs average adsorptive strength (K-M), adsorptive strength
   polydispersity (a), affinity to AC (1/n) and non-adsorbable fraction
   (C-non/C-T0), respectively. These parameters were determined by model
   description of observed isotherms with a distributed fictive component
   method.
   The heavy storm of rain brought higher content of larger organic
   components into the river source, thus causing changes of NOMs
   weight-averaged MWs in the range of 2962-3495 Dalton and MW
   polydispersity in the narrow range of 1.153-1.226. Comparison of K-M and
   sigma values for all samples assessed with both indices of TOC and UV260
   showed that large proportions of the storm-induced organic components
   had adsorptive strengths similar to those existent before the storm,
   with the presence levels for components revealing much strong and weak
   adsorbabilities being low. Among all organic components brought into the
   river by the storm of rain, the percentages of non-adsorbable ones was
   lower (smaller C-non/C-T0 values); and the adsorbable ones had generally
   more affinity to the adsorbents used (smaller 1/n values). (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The bagasse fly ash, an industrial solid waste of sugar industry, was
   used for the removal of cadmium and nickel from wastewater. As much as
   90\% removal of cadmium and nickel is possible in about 60 and 80 min,
   respectively, under the batch test conditions. Effect of various
   operating variables, viz., solution pH, adsorbent dose, adsorbate
   concentration, temperature, particle size, etc., on the removal of
   cadmium and nickel has been studied. Maximum adsorption of cadmium and
   nickel occurred at a concentration of 14 and 12 mg l(-1) and at a pH
   value of 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. A dose of 10 g l(-1) of adsorbent
   was sufficient for the optimum removal of both the metal ions. The
   material exhibits good adsorption capacity and the adsorption data
   follow the Langmuir model better then the Freundlich model. The
   adsorption of both the metal ions increased with increasing temperature
   indicating endothermic nature of the adsorption process. Isotherms have
   been used to determine thermodynamic parameters of the process, viz.,
   free energy change, enthalpy change and entropy change. (C) 2003

Pages = {{3289-3298}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The paper draws together information on factors which influence the
   conditioning and dewatering behaviour of an alum sludge gained from the
   coagulation of a low-turbidity coloured water. A principal focus is the
   potential impact of aluminium hydroxide on the sludge character.
   Background information is provided on the composition of the source floc
   for the domain pH 6.0-6.5 and Al > 2.0 mg/l. From this, there were many
   pointers to the presence of Al(OHMS) within the floc. A series of
   comparisons were made between an alum sludge and a hydroxide suspension
   at a concentration equivalent to the coagulant fraction within the
   sludge. The parameters studied included floc size, floc density, polymer
   adsorption and dewatering behaviour at different time-scales. In all
   cases, there were strong similarities in the behaviour of the two
   suspensions-indicating the potential impact of the hydroxide. There was
   also evidence of common features being displayed by both the organic
   fractions and the hydroxide. It was suggested that some of the
   behavioural features might emanate from a common fractal structure
   within the source floc, the fractal dimension ( approximate to 1) being
   insensitive to composition. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The fate of dissolved microcystin-LR was studied in laboratory
   experiments using surface water taken from a eutrophic lake. Based on
   initial range finding, a concentration of 50 mug l(-1) dissolved
   C-14-microcystin-LR was selected for subsequent time-course experiments.
   The first was performed in May before the cyanobacterial bloom season
   and low increases in the radioactivity of particulate fractions occurred
   with an approx. halving of the cyano-toxin during 4 days. The
   radioactivity of the dissolved fraction remained stable and there was no
   significant formation of radiolabelled inorganic carbon. A second
   time-course experiment was performed in September during the
   cyanobacterial bloom season. At the end of the four-day incubation
   period, the microcystin-LR concentration had decreased to an
   undetectable level and 24\% of the added radiolabelled substance was
   found in different particulate fractions. The study demonstrated that
   biodegradation of dissolved microcystin-LR occurred in water collected
   at a lake surface with carbon dioxide as a major end-product. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Redox potentials and sediment porewater parameters were measured around
   the periphery of a small cove along the San Jacinto River in Texas
   throughout a crude oil and chemical dispersant remediation study to
   distinguish normal dynamics from those caused as a response to stress
   from oil deposition and chemical treatment and subsequent recovery.
   Before the application of oil and treatments, sediments displayed
   average redox potentials of 0-350mV when not submerged. Within 2 days of
   the applications, redox potentials in these plots decreased and
   exhibited a range from -200 to 0mV for a duration of 5 weeks. Applied
   treatments significantly reduced the sediments of the wetland. Reduced
   redox potentials were indicative of the corresponding sulfate reduction
   that was also found to be significant following the oil application.
   GC/MS and MPN analysis indicates this reduction is due to biological
   oxidation of the crude oil components by alkane- and PAH-degraders in
   these surficial sediments and validates the usefulness of the redox
   measurement as an indicator for carbon oxidation. Increases in aqueous
   phase total organic and inorganic carbon coincided with a decrease in pH
   shortly after the applications, suggesting incomplete mineralization and
   the generation of organic acids. While dissolved ferrous iron and
   sulfide have been found to be good indicators of reductive processes in
   petroleum-contaminated aquifer sediments; that was not the case in this
   wetland study. Despite the disappearance of sulfate following the oil
   application, dissolved ferrous iron and sulfide concentrations remained
   at preapplication levels suggesting the formation of mackinawite and/or
   pyrite. The transient exposure of surface sediments to oxygen
   complicates the consideration of potential solid phase pathways since
   aqueous iron may be removed by precipitation when oxidized or reduced,
   making porewater iron a poor indicator for terminal electron accepting
   processes in wetland sediments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Many fruits and vegetables are irrigated with water from rivers, lakes
   and even wastewater systems. Irrigation may be a route for the
   introduction of Salmonella. Our objectives in this study were to
   determine survivability and virulence expression in a strain of
   Salmonella typhimurium when exposed to environmental water sources.
   Virulence expression was measured using a beta-galactosidase assay on a
   hilA:lacZY fusion strain of S. typhimurium. Water samples for
   environmental impact studies were taken from a local pond and specific
   sites along the Rio Grande River, which serves as a source of irrigation
   water in southern Texas. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) of
   virulence expression among the water sites. Certain regions along the
   Rio Grande River yielded greater amounts of beta-galactosidase activity
   than others. All sites yielded at least a two-fold greater virulence
   response than S. typhimurium grown in brain heart infusion. Salmonella
   survivors were enumerated as colony forming units (CFU)/ml as plated on
   a selective medium for the duration of I week and beta-galactosidase
   assays were performed to determine a possible correlation between
   culturable cells and virulence gene expression. Bacterial cells remained
   viable but decreased after 7 days incubation. In conclusion, water
   sampled at specific locations and at different times water samples
   exhibited differences in virulence expression in S. typhimurium. (C)

Abstract = {{Sludge deflocculation can cause, like excessive growth of filamentous
   bacteria, activated sludge wastewater treatment failure. Yet, unlike the
   latter cause, there exists no widely accepted tool to assess the
   flocculation level of activated sludge and to predict sludge
   deflocculation. In this study, a test procedure is proposed to assess
   the sensitivity of activated sludge floes to shear. The test consists in
   subjecting sludge sample to a shear treatment followed by a sludge
   volume measurement (SV30), with reference to a control. The ratio (\%)
   obtained by dividing the SV30 of the sheared sample by the SV30 of the
   control is used to express the shear sensitivity. In a first series of
   experiments using two types of sludge, the test was shown to be able of
   ranging sludge samples in a correct order of shear sensitivity. Applying
   this so-called shear-SV test procedure to a series of sludge samples
   allowed to distinguish amorphous sludges (SV30 ratio greater than or
   equal to 100\%) from normal sludges (SV30 ratio < 100\%). The test was
   shown to be repeatable and simple. It requires only basic laboratory
   equipment and implies minimum cost. It can be used as framework for the
   assessment of activated sludge shear sensitivity in practice. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The adsorption of Cr(Ill) in aqueous solution was investigated on a
   series of ozonised activated carbons, analysing the effect of oxygenated
   surface groups on the adsorption process. A study was carried out to
   determine the adsorption isotherms and the influence of the pH on the
   adsorption of this metal. The adsorption capacity and affinity of the
   adsorbent for Cr(III) increased with the increase in oxygenated acid
   groups on the surface of the activated carbon. These findings imply that
   electrostatic-type interactions predominate in the adsorption process,
   although the adsorption of Cr(Ill) on the original (basic) carbon
   indicates that other forces also participate in the adsorption process.
   Thus, the ionic exchange of protons in the -Cpi-H3O+ interaction for
   Cr(Ill) accounts for the adsorption of cationic species in basic carbons
   with positive charge density. Study of the influence of pH on the
   adsorption of Cr(111) showed that, in each system, the maximum
   adsorption occurred when the charge of the carbon surface was opposite
   that of the species of Cr(III) present at the pH of the experiment.
   These results confirmed that electrostatic interactions predominate in
   the adsorption process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The speciation of aluminum in solutions of alum and various
   prehydrolyzed, aluminum-based water treatment coagulants was
   investigated by Al-27 NMR at 5degreesC and 25degreesC. Alum solutions
   were seen to contain only mononuclear species including an AlSO4+
   complex, while the prehydrolyzed coagulant solutions contained
   polynuclear aluminum species, as well. The relative proportions of both
   polynuclear species and AlSO4+ complex decreased in cold water. The
   presence of organic matter had little effect on the speciation of
   aluminum in diluted alum, but markedly reduced the relative proportion
   of the tridecamer species in the prehydrolyzed coagulant solutions. The
   relationship between Al speciation in the coagulants and organic matter
   removal during jar tests was considered, and the possible role of
   sulfate in both the formation of the tridecamer species and the effect
   of organic matter on coagulation efficiency was discussed. Crown

Abstract = {{Static magnetic field (MF) effects on the properties of freshly
   precipitated calcium carbonate have been investigated in the presence of
   impurity ion Mg2+, Fe2+, or SO42-. One or both solutions, CaCl2 and
   Na2CO3, were exposure to MF 4 (0.5T) for 20 min at 20degreesC. Then
   calcium carbonate was precipitated and zeta potential, pH and light
   absorbance (lambda = 543.3 nm) were measured. The same parameters were
   also determined for the reference systems in which the solutions were
   not MF-treated. It was found that in all the systems tested MF effects
   as determined by the above mentioned parameters had appeared. They
   depended on the kind of the impurity ion present, as well as on which
   solution, CaCl2, Na2CO3 or both, MF interacted. For example, if Mg2+ ion
   was present in CaCl2 solution, the largest shift in the zeta potential
   toward higher positive values was observed if Na2CO3 was MF-treated
   (e.g. from 2 to 12mV) and the same was true as for the maximum in the
   light absorbance and the pH increase. Interestingly, if (CaCl2 + Mg2+)
   was MF-treated pH of the slurry had decreased. Moreover, a correlation
   between above mentioned MF effects and the entropy of hydration of the
   ions has also been found. This points to the changes in the hydrating
   water structure caused by magnetic field. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{In recent years, a rising number of different table waters
   supersaturated with oxygen have hit the market with claims of both
   positive health effects and an increase in athletic performance. In
   addition to research on the correctness of these claims and their
   possible physiological reasons, the appearance of oxygen supersaturation
   as a marketing promise also creates a need for appropriate analytical
   techniques allowing a rapid and reliable determination of oxygen
   contents in such waters. Here, we present NMR relaxometry as a possible
   analytical tool for such studies. NMR relaxation in oxygen
   supersaturated water is not only of interest in the context of
   monitoring the oxygen content in such drinking water products, but also
   might offer some interesting possibilities in medical and environmental
   science MRI applications.
   As a contact-less measuring method, NMR relaxometry avoids disturbance
   of the measurement due to outgassing. The method was applied in the
   concentration range from 10 mg l(-1) to over 100 mg l(-1) dissolved
   oxygen. In addition to freshly sampled drinking waters, also oxygen
   losses during storage of the water in open drinking vials was studied.

Abstract = {{The goal of the work was to determine if biological treatment of water
   containing soil-derived humic substances has the potential for reducing
   the fouling of membranes used in water treatment. Laboratory scale
   biological filters containing biologically active carbon or iron oxide
   coated sand were fed humic-laden water with or without prechlorination.
   This stream was split, with half being further treated by
   microfiltration. Treated water was assessed for total organic carbon
   removal and biofouling potential using a glass bead assay and membrane
   assay for total cell counts, fouling layer thickness, and flux
   reduction. A combination of these assays provided more insight than any
   single measurement. Compared to untreated control water, biological
   treatment was capable of reducing downstream fouling of membrane
   systems. For example, fouling layer thickness was reduced by half after
   biological treatment, and cell counts were reduced four- to five-fold.
   Biological treatment coupled with microfiltration provided the best
   reduction of fouling, while prechlorination did not appear to impact the
   process. These results suggest that biological treatment may be valuable
   in reducing membrane fouling while reducing the amount of disinfectants
   used in pretreatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Mildly acidic metal (Cu, Zn, Ni, Fe, Al and Mg), arsenic and sulfate
   contaminated waters were treated, over a 14 day period at 25degreesC, in
   a bench-scale upflow anaerobic packed bed reactor filled with silica
   sand and employing a mixed population of sulfate-reducing bacteria
   (SRB). The activity of SRB increased the water pH from similar to4.5 to
   7.0, and enhanced the removal of sulfate and metals in comparison to
   controls not inoculated with SRB. Addition of organic substrate and
   sulfate at loading rates of 7.43 and 3.71kg d(-1)m(-3), respectively,
   resulted in >82\% reduction in sulfate concentration. The reactor
   removed more than 97.5\% of the initial concentrations of Cu, Zn and Ni,
   while only >77.5\% and >82\% of As and Fe were removed, respectively. In
   contrast, Mg and Al levels remained unchanged during the whole treatment
   process. The removal patterns for Cu, Zn, Ni and Fe reflected the trend
   in their solubility for their respective metal sulfides, while As
   removal appeared to coincide with decreasing Cu, Zn, Ni and Fe
   concentrations, which suggests adsorption or concomitant precipitation
   with the other metal sulfides. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Phosphorus adsorption maximum of sands for use as media in subsurface
   flow constructed reed beds as measured by the Langmuir isotherm}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The P-adsorption capacities of 13 Danish sands were studied by
   short-term isotherm batch experiments and related to the
   physico-chemical characteristics of the sands. The maximum P-adsorption
   capacities (Q) and P-binding energy constants (b) were calculated using
   the Langmuir-isotherm model. The Freundlich model was also used, but it
   was not useful for the description of adsorption phenomena per se since
   it fitted well P-removal data even if precipitation of P-salts occurred
   simultaneously. The Langmuir model described the data well (R-2 = 0.90 -
   0.99) when precipitation of phosphates did not occur and seems therefore
   to be useful for describing the adsorption processes per se. The
   relationships between maximum sorption capacities and physico-chemical
   characteristics of the sands were investigated using classical
   univariate and partial least squares regression analyses. Among the
   physico-chemical properties of the sands, Ca and Mg content, grain size,
   porosity, bulk density and hydraulic conductivity were significantly
   related (P < 0.1) to the maximum adsorption capacity as estimated by the
   Langmuir model. Using the maximum P-adsorption capacities, it was
   estimated how long the P-removal can be sustained with the different
   sands in subsurface flow constructed reed beds. If the most efficient
   sand for P-adsorption was used, the adsorption capacity would be used up
   after about I year, while, for the less efficient sands, the P-retention
   would go on for about 2 months. This suggests that, in order to sustain
   a long-term P-removal in subsurface flow constructed reed beds,
   precipitation reactions of insoluble P-salts should be promoted.
   P-binding energy constants were not significantly related to the
   physico-chemical properties of the sands, except the Ca content, which
   showed, however, a low correlation coefficient. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A 5-year program of study was conducted at the Sweetwater Recharge
   Facilities (SRF) to assess the performance of surface spreading
   operations for organics attenuation during field-scale soil-aquifer
   treatment (SAT) of municipal wastewater. Studies were conducted
   utilizing both mature (similar to 10 yr old) and new infiltration
   basins. Removals of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were robust,
   averaging > 90 percent during percolation through the local 37-m vadose
   zone. The hydrophilic (most polar) fraction of DOC was preferentially
   removed during SAT; removals were attributed primarily to
   biodegradation. Reductions in trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP)
   averaged 91 percent across the vadose zone profile. The reactivity
   (specific THMFP) of post-SAT organic residuals with chlorine decreased
   slightly from pre-SAT levels (60 vs. 72 mug THM per mg DOC,
   respectively). Variations in the duration of wetting/drying periods did
   not significantly impact organic removal efficiencies. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The partitioning of the non-ionic surfactant Tergitol NP-10 (TNP10) and
   pentachlorophenol (PCP) into a mineral oil light non-aqueous phase
   liquid (NAPL) were quantified in batch tests. Due to the ionizable
   nature of PCP, the effects of pH and ionic strength (mu) on the
   equilibrium partitioning were evaluated. NAPL:water partition
   coefficients (K-new) of TNP10 ranged from 3 to 7L(water)/L-NAPL.
   Enhanced PCP dissolution into water from the NAPL was achieved at
   aqueous TNP10 concentrations greater than or equal to200mg/L. Surfactant
   addition of 1200mg/L TNP10 increased the aqueous PCP concentrations by
   14-fold at pH 5 versus 2 to 3-fold at pH 7 as compared to PCP aqueous
   solubility. The more significant response at the lower pH is likely due
   to the greater hydrophobicity of PCP at the lower pH, which is
   approaching PCP's pK(a) of 4.7. Higher ionic strength (mu 0.11 versus
   0.001 M) increased K-new of PCP by 10-33\% without surfactant, compared
   to a more than 150\% increase with a dose of 4000mg/L TNP10. This work
   contributes information relevant to the application of surfactants to
   remediate sites contaminated with NAPLs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A study of water quality variation in shallow protected springs in
   Kampala was undertaken over a 12-month period to assess the causes of
   microbiological contamination. The microbiological quality of water was
   assessed using thermotolerant coliforms and faecal streptococci.
   Sanitary inspections and hazard assessments were undertaken to identify
   faecal sources (hazards), contaminant pathways and contributory factors.
   Data were collected on rainfall and population as additional factors
   potentially exerting an influence on microbiological quality. Initial
   analysis of the data showed a significant relationship between median
   level of contamination and rainfall, in particular to short-term
   rainfall events. Total sanitary risk score showed a significant
   relationship with median level of contamination, but population density
   may be a confounding factor. The raw microbiological data were
   transformed into five water quality targets: <1 and less than or equal
   to10 cfu 100 ml(-1) for faecal streptococci; and <1, less than or equal
   to10 and less than or equal to50 cfu 100 ml(-1) for thermotolerant
   coliforms. The presence of individual risk factors as well as variables
   for rainfall and population density were analysed with respect to
   failure to meet these water quality targets using contingency tables.
   Logistic regression models were developed for each of the five water
   quality targets. The analysis strongly suggested that there is rapid
   recharge of the springs after rainfall and this leads to microbiological
   contamination. On-site sanitation was less important than other sources
   of faecal matter, which was consistent with a low sanitation coverage in
   the study area. The study suggested that improving sanitary completion
   and local environmental hygiene was more important than controlling
   on-site sanitation in improving the quality of these springs. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The external nitrification (EN) biological nutrient removal (BNR)
   activated sludge (ENBNRAS) system shows considerable promise for
   full-scale implementation. As an aid for this implementation, a
   mathematical simulation model would be an invaluable tool. To develop
   such a model, a study was conducted to select the most suitable
   simulation model to serve as a starting point for further development.
   For this, the existing available simulation models for BNRAS systems are
   compared with one another and evaluated against experimental
   observations in the literature and on ENBNRAS systems. One process
   immediately apparent to be crucially important is the anoxic growth of
   phosphorus accumulating organisms (PAOs), with associated PAO
   denitrification and anoxic P uptake for polyP formation. These linked
   processes are lacking in the earlier kinetic simulation models for BNRAS
   systems, which were based on aerobic PAO growth and P uptake only, but
   have been incorporated into the more recent kinetic models. This
   provides a substantive body of information on modelling this aspect.
   Other processes of significance identified to require consideration are
   anaerobic slowly biodegradable COD (SBCOD) hydrolysis to readily
   biodegradable COD (RBCOD), and COD loss. Both processes have significant
   impact on the predicted BEPR performance. Due to the uncertainties
   associated with the mechanisms and quantification of these two
   processes, it is concluded that the most extensively validated kinetic
   simulation model should be selected for development, and that the
   omissions in this model should be addressed progressively, using the
   relevant information drawn from the existing models, the literature and
   observations on ENBNRAS systems. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Wastewater containing formaldehyde and urea was treated using a coupled
   system consisting of a biofilm airlift suspension (BAS) reactor and an
   anoxic upflow sludge blanket (USB) reactor. The anoxic USB reactor was
   used to carry out denitrification and urea hydrolysis, while the BAS
   reactor was used to carry out nitrification.
   In a first step, individual experiments were carried out to investigate
   the effects of both compounds on the nitrifying and denitrifying
   biomass. The BAS reactor was fed with a synthetic medium containing
   500mg N-NH4+ L-1 and 100 mg N-urea L-1, that were added continuously to
   this medium. Neither urea hydrolysis nor inhibition of nitrification was
   observed. Nitrification efficiency decreased when formaldehyde was fed
   during shocks at concentrations of 40, 80 and 120 mg C-formaldehyde L-1.
   The anoxic USB reactor was fed with a synthetic medium containing
   nitrate, formaldehyde and urea. Concentrations of formaldehyde in the
   reactor of 100 120mg C-formaldehyde L-1 caused a decrease in the
   denitrification and urea hydrolysis rates.
   In a second step, the coupled system was operated at recycling ratios
   (R) of 3 and 9. Fed C/N ratios of 0.58, 1.0 and 1.5 g C-formaldchyde
   g(-1) N-NH4+ were used for every recycling ratio. The maximum nitrogen
   removal percentages were achieved at a C/N ratio of 1.0 g C-formaldehyde
   g(-1) N-NH4+ for both recycling ratios. A fed C/N ratio of 1.5 g
   C-formaldehyde g(-1) N-NH4+ caused a decrease in the efficiency of the
   system with respect to nitrogen removal, due to the presence of
   formaldehyde in the BAS reactor, which decreased the nitrification.
   Formaldehyde was completely removed in the BAS reactor and a
   heterotrophic layer formed around the nitrifying biofilm. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{This study aims to further investigate the total mineralization of the
   bacteria to the extent of death and cell-mass inactivation using a
   TiO(2)-Fe(2)O(3) membrane photocatalytic oxidation reactor. Experimental
   results clearly indicated that dissolved oxygen (DO), hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) and concentration of the model bacteria
   (Escherichia coliform) affected the removal efficiency. It was found
   that the ultimate removal efficiency was 99\% at DO level of 21.34 mg/L,
   HRT at 60 s and high concentration of E. coli at 10(9) CFU/mL. The
   morphologic studies also showed that E coliform could be further
   mineralized into CO(2) and H(2)O. Dissolved organic carbon, pH and gas
   chromatograph analysis had justified most importantly the evolution Of
   CO(2). Experimental results revealed that the photomineralization rate
   of E. coliform followed pseudo-first-order kinetics by the role of DO.
   The derived empirical models were found consistent with the proposed
   reaction pathways of a combined UV breakdown on mass cell and a
   dual-site Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism where the rate-controlling step
   is the surface interaction between the adsorbed cleavage bacterial cells
   and hydroxyl radicals. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study investigated the characteristics of denitrifying phosphorus
   removal bacteria by using three different types of electron acceptors as
   well as the positive role of nitrite in phosphorus removal process.
   Denitrifying phosphorous removal bacteria was enriched under
   anaerobic-anoxic (A/A) condition. To understand A/A sludge better,
   sludge from two other sources were also studied. These include sludges
   obtained from a lab-scale anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (A/A/O) system and a
   local sewage treatment plant. Three types of possible electron acceptors
   (oxygen, nitrate and nitrite) were examined for their roles in
   phosphorus uptake. The results obtained indicated that oxygen, nitrate
   and nitrite were able to act as electron acceptors successfully. This
   observation suggested that in addition to the two well-accepted groups
   of phosphorus removal bacteria (one can only utilize oxygen to take up
   phosphorus, P-O, while the other can use both oxygen and nitrate, P-ON),
   a new group of phosphorus removal bacteria, P-ONn, which could use
   oxygen, nitrate or nitrite to take up phosphorus was identified. The
   relative population of these three types of bacteria could be calculated
   from results obtainable from phosphorus uptake batch experiments with
   either oxygen or nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptor. The results
   obtained in this study showed that A/A sludge had similar phosphorus
   removal performance as the A/A/O sludge. However, it has better
   denitrifying phosphorus removal capability, which was demonstrated by
   the relative population of the three groups of bacteria. The results
   also suggested that nitrite was not an inhibitor to phosphorus removal
   process. Instead, it is an alternative electron acceptor to oxygen or
   nitrate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Husk of black gram (Cicer arientinum), a waste of no commercial value,
   was investigated as a new biosorbent of cadmium from low concentration
   aqueous solutions. With 99.99\% sorption efficiency from 10 mg l(-1)
   cadmium solution, the biomass required at saturation was 0.8 g mg(-1)
   cadmium. Biosorption was rapid and equilibrium was achieved in 30 min.
   Among the various desorbing agents tested, 99.89\% cadmium recovery was
   achieved with 0.1 M HCl. Sorption efficiency of cadmium during six
   biosorption-desorption cycles in batch operations declined, which was
   traceable to 39.0\% black gram husk (bgh) weight loss. This decline was
   only 9.71\% when compensated for biomass loss, which is comparable to
   10.45\% decline during six cycles in fixed bed column bioreactor in
   which biomass loss was only 5.98\%. On plotting breakthrough curves it
   was noted that bgh in the fixed bed column was capable of bringing down
   cadmium concentration from 10 to 0.1 mg l(-1) in 35.51 volume.
   Biosorption of cadmium was not effected in the presence of other
   cations. Comprehensive characterization of parameters indicate bgh to be
   an excellent material for biosorption of cadmium to treat wastewaters
   containing low concentration of the metal. As an agrowaste, the
   advantage of application of this material as a metal biosorbent in a
   fixed bed column bioreactor system, in comparison with those based on
   immobilized algae or biomass of algal, fungal and bacterial origin, is
   considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pesticide uptake by seeds depends on the properties of the chemical,
   such as structure, stability, log k(ow) and diffusion rate, type of
   water, pH, temperature, content of organic matter and composition, and
   on seed characteristics such as permeability of the seed coat. The
   efficiency with which Lupinus angustifolius seeds retain different
   herbicides (simazine, atrazine, isoproturon, linuron) and insecticides
   (carbaryl, fenamiphos, permethrin) was evaluated using both a batch and
   a continuous system. Factors which affect pesticide uptake by seeds,
   such as flow rate, seed biomass, pesticide concentration, contact time,
   pH, seed saturation and also the speed of the retention process for 17
   days, were tested. L. angustifolius showed a high retention capacity for
   the above mentioned pesticides.
   The extraction of pesticides from seeds using different organic
   solvents, such as methanol, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate and n-hexane was
   evaluated and no pesticide residues were detected in any of the solvents
   tested. This could be attributed to the capacity of the seed to degrade
   the pesticides. From the results obtained, L. angustifolius seems to be
   a promising seed to be applied for phytoremediation of industrial
   effluents or contaminated water. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Pathogenic enteric viruses can be retained in municipal sewage sludge as
   has been reported by many researchers. Although the RT-PCR technique has
   been extensively employed for the virus detection from various
   environmental samples, the application of RT-PCR to the detection of
   viruses in sewage sludge has the difficulty because of inhibitory
   substances to the gene amplification. However, a combination of the
   enzymatic virus elution (EVE) method with RTPCR made it possible to
   effectively detect viruses in sewage sludge. The enzymatic breakdown of
   sludge flocs in the EVE method enhanced the virus elution from
   poliovirus 1 (PV1)-inoculated sewage sludge, and the detection of PV1
   was performed by RT-PCR without any inhibitions. On the contrary, the
   application of RT-PCR to the viral assay in the USEPA method using the
   10\% beef extract solution was not practical because of inhibitions to
   the viral gene amplification. The combination of the EVE method using
   lysozyme (polysaccharide-degrading enzyme), papain (protease), and
   chymotrypsin (protease) with RT-PCR resulted in a virus recovery
   efficiency of 31\%, but a synergistic effect of these enzymes on the
   virus recovery efficiency was not observed. The EVE method using
   lysozyme or papain could be a promising procedure for the virus elution
   from sewage sludge in detecting these viruses with RT-PCR. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The anaerobic biodegradation of hexahydro-1, 3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine
   (RDX), octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX), and
   2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) by a methanogenic mixed culture was
   investigated. Microcosms containing a basal medium and the mixed culture
   were amended with ethanol, propylene glycol (PG), butyrate or hydrogen
   gas as the electron donor and a mixture of TNT (50 muM), RDX (25 muM),
   and HMX (8 muM). After 29 days TNT and RDX were completely transformed
   to unidentified endproducts in the bottles amended with ethanol,
   hydrogen, or PG, while 53\%, 40\%, and 22\% of the HMX was transformed,
   respectively. There was no loss of RDX or HMX in the electron donor
   unamended control bottles. The ethanol and PG were transformed to near
   stoichiometric amounts of acetate and propionate, suggesting the
   immediate electron donor supporting the transformation of the explosives
   was the H(2) evolved during the metabolism of the parent substrate. Our
   findings suggest that the addition of H(2) or electron donors that
   produce H(2) may be a useful strategy for enhancing the anaerobic
   biodegradation of explosives in contaminated groundwater and soils.

Abstract = {{The sorption of Ni2+ by acclimatized activated sludge treating Ni2+
   bearing wastewater was investigated using a once-through completely
   mixed tank reactor. The culture developed from sewage was acclimatized
   to 85.2 mumole/L Ni2+ influent concentration by stepwise increases, at a
   low dilution rate 0.11/h. Acclimation was found to enhance the sorptive
   capacity of the activated sludge. In fact, at all of the intermediate
   concentrations, percentage Ni2+ adsorbed by the biomass and also the
   sorptive capacity of the activated sludge drastically increased with an
   increase in the influent Ni2+ concentration. All influent Ni2+
   concentrations were found to significantly stimulate the observed
   biomass yield of the culture over that observed in the base line.
   Experimental findings obtained at two other dilution rates; namely,
   0.25/h and 0.45/h revealed that dilution rate is a significant
   operational parameter affecting the Ni2+ sorption characteristics of
   acclimatized activated sludge microorganisms. Considerable complexation
   of nickel and organic and inorganic ligands in the wastewater appeared
   to be responsible for a relatively lower Ni2+ sorption capacity. (C)

Abstract = {{The adsorption of three estrogenic compounds (bisphenol A (BPA),
   17beta-estradiol (E2), and 17alpha-ethynyl estradiol (EE2)) on several
   powdered activated carbons (PAC) was investigated. Without
   preconcentration, method detection limits (MDL) using high-performance
   liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection at an
   excitation wavelength of 280nm and an emission wavelength of 310nm were
   0.88, 1.15, and 0.96nM for BPA, E2, and EE2, respectively. Compound
   recoveries were >90\% in raw drinking water matrices. PAC screening
   studies (six PAC brands) indicated all three compounds were removed by
   PAC, but the percentage removal ranged from 31\% to >99\% based upon PAC
   type/dosage and presence/absence of natural organic matter. The order of
   removal (E2>EE2>BPA) corresponded with log K-ow values for the compounds
   (3.1-4.0, 3.7-3.9, 3.3, respectively). Kinetic and PAC dose-response
   experiments were conducted with the two best performing PACs. Increasing
   contact time and PAC dose improved compound removal. Freundlich isotherm
   parameters were fit to the experimental data. This study confirms that
   PAC treatment is feasible for >99\% removal of three estrogenic
   compounds from raw drinking waters that may be at risk for containing
   such compounds, at least at initial concentration of 500ng/L and higher.

Abstract = {{This research project was initiated to refine the knowledge available on
   the treatment of rural municipal wastewater by constructed wetlands. To
   determine the treatment capacity of a constructed wetland system
   receiving municipal lagoon effluents, the wetland was monitored over one
   treatment season, from May 19 to November 3, 2000. The wetland system
   consisted of a three-cell free-surface wetland, phosphorus adsorption
   slag filters and a vegetated filter strip. Bimonthly water samples at
   the inlet and outlet of each component of the wetland system were
   analysed for biochemical oxygen demand, nitrate and nitrite, ammonia and
   ammonium, total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total suspended solids (TSS),
   total phosphorus (TP), ortho-phosphate (ortho-PO4), fecal coliforms
   (FCs) and Escherichia coli. The free-surface wetland cells treating the
   lagoon effluents achieved removals as follows: biochemical oxygen demand
   (34\%), ammonia and ammonium (52\%), TKN (37\%), TSS (93\%), TP (90\%),
   ortho-PO4 (82\%), FCs (52\%) and E coli (58\%). The wetland cells
   reduced total nitrogen, TP and biochemical oxygen demand to levels below
   the maximum permissible levels required for direct discharge to nearby
   receiving waters (TN < 3.0mgL(-1), TP < 0.3 mg L-1, BOD5 < 3.0 mg L-1).
   The vegetated filter strip treating the effluents from the wetland cells
   achieved removals as follows: biochemical oxygen demand (18\%), ammonia
   and ammonium (28\%), TKN (11\%), TSS (22\%), TP (5\%), FCs (28\%) and E
   coli (22\%). It may therefore serve as an additional treatment stage
   further reducing the concentrations of these mentioned parameters. The
   slag filters reduced TP in the lagoon effluents by up to 99\%, and, in
   this study, were concluded to be effective phosphorus adsorbers. (C)

   three different runs. Waters before biotreatment and primary sludge were
   found to be toxic; but in the activated sludge treatment toxicity was
   removed. During wastewater treatment, concentrations of wood extractives
   were reduced over 97\%. In activated sludge treatment, over 94\% of the
   resin acids and over 41\% of the sterols were degraded or transformed to
   other compounds. Furthermore, in general, less than 5\% of the resin
   acids and over 31\% of the sterols were removed in biosludge to the
   sludge thickener. Most of the extractives were discharged attached to
   particles. Although some disturbing factors increased the load of wood
   extractives during samplings, these factors did not affect the
   operational efficiency of the secondary treatment system. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The Mann-Whitney U-test is used to demonstrate the impact of phosphate
   on lead concentrations measured at customer properties. This test is
   statistically robust and particularly efficient for the type of
   distributions encountered in lead random daytime sampling. This
   non-parametric technique is developed-to provide a best estimate of the
   lead reduction that results from a change in plumbosolvency conditicins.
   The method is illustrated with compliance data collected before and
   after the introduction of phosphate at customer properties in the north
   west of England. Limitations due to operational factors are highlighted.
   Using a Monte Carlo simulation of the variability of lead random daytime
   samples it is shown that the method might be practical when assessing
   the impact of incremental changes in phosphate concentration on

Title = {{A model of microbial activity in lake sediments in response to periodic
   water-column mixing}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2833-2846}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Under stagnant conditions, the mass transport of a soluble substrate
   from a lake's water column to the sediment/water interface is limited by
   molecular diffusion. Stagnant conditions coupled with a continuing
   sediment biological demand create a substrate depletion zone above the
   sediment/water interface. The frequency at which the substrate depletion
   zone is destroyed by internal seiches and other intermittent flow
   phenomena influences the time-averaged substrate concentration at the
   sediment/water interface. A more frequent mixing results in a greater
   time-averaged interface concentration and consequently affects the
   amount of microbial biomass that can be supported in the lake sediments
   and the flux of the substrate into the sediment.
   A one-dimensional, two-substrate model is used to examine the impact of
   mixing frequency on the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) in
   lake sediments. In the model, sulfate is supplied from the water column,
   while acetate is generated within the sediments. Mass transport to and
   within the sediments is by molecular diffusion except for instantaneous
   mixing events. Between mixing events, sulfate concentration gradients
   form above the sediment/water interface in the diffusive boundary layer.
   Sulfate depletion zones can be centimeters thick. When typical
   biological rate and diffusion coefficients for sulfate and acetate are
   used as inputs, the model indicates that a more frequent water-column
   mixing results in greater SRB concentrations. For an assumed bulk
   water-column sulfate concentration of 4.8 mg l(-1), the sediment SRB
   concentrations for the modeled hourly, 6-hourly, daily, and weekly
   mixing frequencies were 175, 136, 9 1, and 30 mg m(-2), respectively.
   The model also predicts higher time-averaged sulfate flux rates at more
   frequent water-column mixing. The time-averaged sulfate flux rates for
   the hourly, 6-hourly, daily, and weekly mixing frequencies were 1.26,
   1.13, 0.78, and 0.30 mg m(-2)h(-1), respectively. Thus, mixing frequency
   can significantly impact microbial activity in lake sediments. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Grain-size distribution, major elements, nutrients and trace metals were
   determined in bed sediments and suspension collected at 10
   representative sites along the river Po under normal and high flow
   conditions. Grain-size distribution and major element composition of
   suspension highlighted the presence of two distinct particle populations
   in the upper-middle Po (coarser particles, lower carbonate content) and
   in the lower Po (finer particles, higher carbonate content). This change
   partly reflects the geological differences between the two parts of the
   basin, and also the presence of a hydroelectric power plant at Isola
   Serafini (Piacenza). With respect to environmental quality issues, bed
   sediments and suspension provide similar results. A moderate nutrient
   pollution is found in all but the uppermost parts of the river basin,
   while the most significant inputs of trace metals appear to originate
   from the urban areas of Turin and Milan. Calculation of sediment
   enrichment factors identifies Cd, Cu, Hg and Zn as the most impacted
   elements by human activities. On the other hand, the high levels of Ni
   and Cr throughout the river seem to derive mainly from the presence of
   basic rocks in the upper and middle parts of the basin. Both nutrient
   and trace metal particulate concentrations substantially decrease under
   high flow conditions possibly due to ``flushing{''} of contaminated bed
   sediments and resuspension of coarser material. Under normal flow
   conditions, water hydrochemistry and concentrations of some elements
   (As, Ca, Cr, Cu, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, and Pb) in the dissolved phase (<
   0.45 mum) were also determined. Calculation of trace metals partition
   coefficients shows that the relative importance of the particulate and
   water phases varies in response to water hydrochemistry and suspended
   solid content, but that most elements achieve a conditional equilibrium
   in the. lower stretches of the river Po. These results are the first of
   this kind reported for the whole river course and highlight the factors
   and mechanisms controlling the origin, mobility and fate of nutrients
   and trace metals in the river Po. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{Simultaneous effects of environmental factors on motile Aeromonas
   dynamics in an urban effluent and in the natural seawater}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal dynamics of motile Aeromonas in a treated urban effluent and in
   natural seawater along the Sfax coast (Mediterranean sea, Tunisia) were
   measured over a year concurrently with seven environmental factors, and
   compared with those of faecal coliforms. Counts for Aeromonas from a
   standard plate count method, ranged from 1.48 x 10(5) CFU.100 ml(-1) to
   2.2 x 10(8) CFU. 100 ml(-1) in the effluent and from 7.9 x 10(3) CFU.100
   ml(-1) to undetectable level in the surface marine waters. Contrary to
   faecal coliforms, the Aeromonas dynamics exhibited a seasonal
   distribution in seawater which was inverse of the seasonal distribution
   in the sewage: From the end of November 1998 to April 1999 (cold
   period), Aeromonas counts increased in the treated effluent, while it
   decreased very rapidly in seawater. From May to October (warm period),
   Aeromonas abundance decreased in the effluent but showed an increasing
   fluctuating trend in the marine waters with a maximum in late
   summer/early autumn when the temperatures were around 22-23degreesC.
   Multiple correlation and regression analyses suggest, by the coefficient
   of determination (R-2), that 42\% of variance in Aeromonas number
   changes in the treated effluent, may be explained by only turbidity,
   radiation and Aeromonas density in the previous sample, while 37\% of
   variance in marine ecosystem were explained by radiance and
   conductivity. Furthermore, the t statistics and their p values and the
   coefficient of partial determination (r(2)) indicated that radiance
   contributed the most (r(2) = 0.3184, t = -3.2, p = 0.0041) to the
   dynamics of motile Aeromonas in seawater, when combined with
   conductivity.
   The models relevant for changes in faecal coliforms abundance
   incorporated turbidity, radiance in the effluent and conductivity, pH,
   radiance, turbidity in coastal marine environment. These models explain
   66\% and 73\% of the observed cell number fluctuation, with turbidity
   (r(2) = 0.529, t = 5.08, p = 0.0001) and conductivity (r(2) = 0.5407, t
   = 4.97, p = 0.0001) as dominant factors in the multivariate model
   proposed, respectively, for the two sampling sites. The results
   presented here suggest that the combination of negative effects of
   sunlight and conductivity in natural seawater mainly affects the
   colony-forming capacity and make the motile Aeromonas nonrecoverable
   during cold months. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sorptive removal of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions by
   calcined Mg-Al-CO3 hydrotalcite was investigated in a batch mode. The
   influence of agitation speed, solution pH, initial chromium
   concentration, sorbent concentration and temperature has been tested in
   kinetic runs. Three kinetic models have been evaluated to fit the
   experimental data: the pseudo-first order, the modified-second order and
   the Elovich equation. It was shown that the first-order model could best
   describe the sorption kinetics. A Freundlich isotherm was used to fit
   equilibrium experiments. Hydrotalcite presents a sorption capacity of
   approximately 120mg Cr/g, under the investigated experimental
   conditions. The calculated activation energy for process studied was
   around 40 kJ/mol. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of bromination of six ortho- and para-substituted phenols
   was investigated between pH 5 and pH 12 in aqueous solution. Kinetics
   was followed with a continuous-flow reactor previously validated by
   studying the fast reaction between chlorine and ammonia. The overall
   reaction rate between bromine and phenols is controlled by the reaction
   of HOBr with the phenoxide ion between pH 6 and pH 10. The reaction of
   HOBr with the undissociated phenols and the reaction of BrO- with the
   phenoxide ions become only significant for pH < 6 and pH > 10,
   respectively. The second-order rate constants for the reaction of HOBr
   with phenoxide ions vary between 1.4(+/-0.1)x 10(3) and
   2.1(+/-0.5)x10(8)M(-1)s(-1) for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol and
   4-methylphenol, respectively. Hammett-type correlation was obtained for
   the reaction of HOBr with the phenoxide ions (log(k)=8.0-3.33 x
   Sigmasigma) and was compared with Hammett-type correlations of HOG and
   HOI. The reaction rate of bromine with phenol-like organic compounds was
   estimated to be about 10(3)-fold higher than with chlorine and
   10(3)-fold lower than with ozone in drinking water treatment conditions.

Abstract = {{The first step in the estimation of parameters of models applied for
   data interpretation should always be an investigation of the
   identifiability of the model parameters. In this study the structural
   identifiability of the model parameters of Monod-based activated sludge
   models (ASM) was studied. In an illustrative example it was assumed that
   respirometric (dissolved oxygen or oxygen uptake rates) and titrimetric
   (cumulative proton production) measurements were available for the
   characterisation of nitrification. Two model structures, including the
   presence and absence of significant growth for description of long- and
   short-term experiments, respectively, were considered. The structural
   identifiability was studied via the series expansion methods. It was
   proven that the autotrophic yield becomes uniquely identifiable when
   combined respirometric and titrimetric data are assumed for the
   characterisation of nitrification. The most remarkable result of the
   study was, however, that the identifiability results could be
   generalised by applying a set of ASM I matrix based generalisation
   rules. It appeared that the identifiable parameter combinations could be
   predicted directly based on the knowledge of the process model under
   study (in ASM1-like matrix representation), the measured variables and
   the biodegradable substrate considered. This generalisation reduces the
   time-consuming task of deriving the structurally identifiable model
   parameters significantly and helps the user to obtain these directly
   without the necessity to go too deeply into the mathematical background
   of structural identifiability. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2905-2918}},

Abstract = {{Engineered systems are often needed to supply an electron donor, such as
   hydrogen (H-2), to the subsurface to stimulate the biological
   dehalogenation of perchloroethene (PCE) to ethene. A column study was
   performed to evaluate the ability of gas permeable hollow-fiber
   membranes to supply H-2 directly to PCE-contaminated groundwater to
   facilitate bioremediation. Two glass columns were packed with soil
   obtained from a trichloroethene-contaminated site at Cape Canaveral,
   Florida, and were fed a minimal medium spiked with PCE (7 muM) for 391
   days. The columns were operated in parallel, with one column receiving
   H-2 via polyethylene hollow-fiber membranes (lumen H-2 pressure of
   approximately 1 atm) and a control column receiving no H-2. PCE was
   initially dechlorinated at a similar rate and to a similar extent in
   both columns, likely due to the presence of soil organic matter that was
   able to support dechlorination. After 265 days of operation,
   dechlorination performance declined in the control column and the
   benefits of membrane-supplied H-2 became evident. Although the
   membrane-supplied H-2 effectively stimulated PCE dechlorination at the
   end of the experiment (days 359-391), the system was inefficient in that
   only 5\% of the supplied H-2 was used for dechlorination. Most of the
   remainder was used to support methanogenesis (94\%). Despite the
   dominance of methanogens, nearly complete dechlorination of PCE to
   ethene was observed in the H-2-fed column. In addition to the
   inefficient use of H-2, operational problems included excessive foulant
   accumulation on the outside of the membrane fibers and water
   condensation inside the fibers. Use of alternative membrane materials
   and changes to the operating approach (e.g. pulsing or supplying H-2 at
   low partial pressures) may help to overcome these problems so that this
   technology can provide effective and stable remediation of aquifers
   contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The application of gas-inducing reactor to obtain high oxygen
   dissolution has been investigated at various operation conditions
   including agitation speed, temperature (20-40degreesC), pressure
   (1.0-1.2atm) and working liquid levels. Correlations regarding onset
   speed, agitation power consumption, gas holdup and oxygen mass transfer
   coefficient were established from experimental data. Onset speed can be
   accurately predicted with modified Froude number. The agitation power
   consumptions before and after onset speed is a function of Froude number
   and working liquid level. Gas holdup is an important factor influencing
   the mass transfer of oxygen after onset speed. In the study of mass
   transfer of oxygen (T = 20degreesC, P = 1 atm), the highest dissolved
   oxygen concentration is as high as 39.34-39.92 mg L-1. The value of
   k(L)a is within 0.511-1.792 min(-1). The k(L)a is not affected by the
   oxygen gas pressure (1.0-1.2atm). However, k(L)a increases with
   increasing temperature. The gas-inducing reactor of this study has
   higher kLa than the other type of gas-inducing reactor under the same
   unit volume power consumption. The pure oxygen utilization rate of this
   system can be as high as 100\%. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The acid waters (pH = 2.73-3.37) originating from the Carnoules mine
   tailings contain high dissolved concentrations of arsenic (1-3.5 mmol
   l(-1)) and iron (20-40 mmol l(-1)). At the outlet, arsenite
   predominates. During the first 30 m of downflow, 20-60\% is removed by
   coprecipitation with Fe(III). This process results from bacterially
   mediated As- and Fe-oxidation. The precipitation rates in the creek
   depend on the oxygen concentration in spring water and are lower during
   the dry summer period when the anoxic character of the spring water
   inhibits the activity of oxidizing bacteria. Ex situ experiments show
   that the presence of bacteria-rich precipitates increases the As- and
   Fe-removal rates. Three strains of bacteria promoting the oxidation of
   As have been isolated, and two of them have the characteristics of
   Thiomonas ynys1. The third strain, which is not identified yet, also
   catalyzes the oxidation of Fe. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents the effect of substrate concentration on the growth
   of a mixed culture of algae and heterotrophic bacteria in secondary
   facultative ponds (SFPs) utilizing settled domestic sewage as a sole
   source of organic carbon. The growth of the mixed culture was studied at
   the concentrations ranging between 200 and 800 mg COD/l in a series of
   batch chernostat reactors. From the laboratory data, the specific growth
   rate (mu) was determined using the modified Gompertz model. The maximum
   specific growth rate (Pax) and half saturation coefficients (K-s) were
   calculated using the Monod kinetic equation. The maximum observed growth
   rate (mu(max)) for heterotrophic bacteria was 3.8 day(-1) with K-s of
   200 mg COD/l. The mu(max) for algal biomass based on suspended volatile
   solids was 2.7 day(-1) with K-s of 110 mg COD/l. The mu(max) of algae
   based on the chlorophyll-a was 3.5 day(-1) at K-s of 50mg COD/l. The
   observed specific substrate removal by heterotrophic bacteria varied
   between the concentrations of substrate used and the average value was
   0.82 (mg COD/mg biomass). The specific substrate utilization rate in the
   bioreactors was direct proportional to the specific growth rate. Hence,
   the determined Monod kinetic parameters are useful for the definition of
   the operation of SFPs. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   species succession of bacteria in activated sludge ecosystems, rather
   than the increase in the phosphorus removal capability of phosphorus
   removal bacteria. Not only Acinetobacter but also Pseudomonas identified
   from isolated strains were regarded as representative
   polyphosphates-accumulating organisms and predominant species to the
   whole of bacterial population in activated sludge for phosphorus
   removal. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of COD/NO(3)(-)-N ratio on the biotransformation and removal
   of 2-nitrophenol (2-NP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), and 2,4-dinitrophenol
   (2,4-DNP) was studied in bench scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket
   (UASB) reactors. Sodium acetate and sodium nitrate were used as electron
   donor (substrate) and electron acceptor, respectively. Nitrate nitrogen
   loading was increased from 0.098 to 0.6 kg/m(3) d in order to keep
   COD/NO(3)(-)-N ratio as 20.8, 14.3, 9.8, 5.0, 4.0 and 3.33. Throughout
   the study, input nitrophenolic concentration and hydraulic retention
   time (HRT) were kept constant as 30 mg/l and 24 h, respectively.
   2-Aminophenol (2-AP), 4-aminophenol (4-AP) and 2-amino,4,-nitrophenol
   (2-A,4-NP) were found as the major intermediate metabolite of 2-NP, 4-NP
   and 2,4-DNP, respectively. Removal of all the three nitrophenols
   increased with lowering of COD/NO(3)(-)-N ratio. However, nitrophenols
   removal got adversely affected when COD/NO(3)(-)-N ratio was reduced
   below 5. Maximum removal achieved were 91.63\%, 90.17\% and 86.10\% for
   2-NP, 4-NP and 2,4-DNP, respectively at a COD/NO(3)(-)-N ratio of 5.
   Simultaneous denitrification and methanogenesis was observed in all the
   reactors throughout the study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In order to elucidate the effect of nanopores and organic matters on
   sequestration of contaminants, short- and long-term sorption and
   desorption of naphthalene and pyrene in seven artificial solid-water
   systems were studied. Fast sorption occurred in every case; steady
   states were reached within 1-5 h. Sorption constants varied drastically
   among the seven absorbents, ranging from 1.19 to 5.29 X 10(3) for
   naphthalene, and from 24.3 to 6.52 x 10(4) for pyrene. Slow sorption
   continued to take place in some cases, especially on absorbents
   containing humic matter. Desorption usually took place in two stages,
   fast and slow, on both unaged and aged absorbents. Irreversibility of
   desorption occurred for every absorbent except for silica particles
   modified with octadecyl silyl. Aging led to a reduction of fast
   desorption fraction due to entrapment of the chemicals into nanopores
   and partitioning of the chemicals into condensed areas of humic matters,
   and showed no effect on slow desorption and irreversibility of
   desorption. On the whole, entrapment into nanopores and partitioning
   into humic matters are considered to be important for sequestration of
   contaminants. Irreversibility of desorption is considered to be a more
   influencing factor than percentage of desorption for describing the
   extent of sequestration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Long-term trends in water quality in eutrophic lowland rivers in eastern
   England were investigated and their impact on macroinvertebrate
   assemblages studied. Dissolved oxygen (DO) declined significantly in
   eight rivers in Essex and Suffolk over 40 years to 1998. Chloride
   concentrations significantly increased during the same period in most
   rivers. Total oxidized nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus
   increased until the 1980s, then began to decline. Biotic scores (Lincoln
   Quality Index) generally increased over 14 years to 1998 and there were
   significant positive relationships between biotic scores and several
   nutrients. Invertebrate families and environmental variables sampled
   over the eight rivers in a dry year (1997) and a wet year (1998) were
   subjected to multivariate analysis. River stretches were grouped
   according to substrate requirements of indicator invertebrates. In the
   dry year, those river stretches behind mills or immediately downstream
   of sewage treatment works (STW) were grouped. In the wet year, there was
   only one separate group, comprising sites downstream of STWs. Nutrients,
   DO and low flows have a much greater influence on water quality, and
   hence invertebrate assemblages, during drought years than during wet
   years. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Inactivation of microorganisms by disinfectants frequently shows
   non-linear behavior on a semilogarithmic plot of log survival ratio
   versus time. A number of models have been developed to depict these
   deviations from Chick's Law. Some of the models predict that the log
   survival ratio (at a particular disinfectant dose and contact time, even
   in absence of demand) would be a function of the initial concentration
   of microorganisms (N-0), while other models do not predict such an
   effect. The effect of N-0 on the survival ratio has not been
   deliberately tested. This work examined the inactivation of Giardia
   muris by ozone in batch systems, deliberately varying the disinfectant
   dose and No. It was found that the models predicting a dependency of
   survival on No gave a better description to the data than models that
   did not predict such a dependency. Hence there is an apparent decrease
   in disinfection efficiency of ozone against Giardia muris (at pH 8 and
   15degreesC) as the initial microorganism concentration decreases. This
   phenomena should be taken into account by both disinfection researchers
   and by process design engineers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{Fouling characteristics of NF and RO operated for removal of dissolved

Abstract = {{A pilot study had been performed for about 6 months in order to
   investigate the removal efficiency of dissolved matter and its fouling
   potential during nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) of local
   groundwater that was pretreated with an ultrafiltration (UF) membrane
   system. After pilot plant operation, autopsy tests were performed to
   identify the characteristics of foulants that were attached to the
   membrane surface. In the autopsy tests, the flux recovery for each
   specific cleaning scheme (hydraulic washing, acid cleaning, and alkaline
   cleaning) was also measured using a dead-end filtration cell unit. The
   washing solution used in each chemical cleaning was analyzed to identify
   major components of the foulants, and the membrane surface was observed
   using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
   Among three kinds of membranes tested, one NF and two RO membranes, the
   NF and RO1 membranes showed a rapid flux decline after 100 days of
   operation. Especially, the RO1 membrane showed the more serious flux
   decline than the NF membrane. The RO2 membrane, with the lowest recovery
   rate, demonstrated a gradual flux decline. The removal efficiency of
   dissolved inorganic matter (as conductivity) for each NF, RO1 and RO2
   membrane was 76.3\%, 88.2\% and 95.3\%, respectively. The removal of
   dissolved organic matter (as total organic carbon) was found to be about
   80\% for both NF and RO membranes used in this study.
   During the membrane autopsy tests, five sections of the fouled membrane
   were cut along each NF and RO membrane module from the feed inlet side
   to the concentrate outlet side, the specific flux for each membrane
   section was measured before and after each cleaning step. As expected,
   the degree of fouling was intensified along the membrane surface as the
   feed flow approached the outlet. Based on the analysis results of wash
   water used in each cleaning step, the major foulants attached to the
   membrane surface appeared to be Ca bound with inorganic matter and Si
   bound with organic matter. Fe seemed to be a great contributor to
   irreversible fouling. The SEM analysis indicated that the organic matter
   was forming the first fouling layer close to the membrane and that the
   inorganic matter was layered top of the organic fouling layer in a
   tetragonal shape. Any evidence of biofouling was not observed in this
   study because most of microorganisms had been already removed by the UF
   pretreatment. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The limited efficacy of disinfectants, other than ultraviolet
   irradiation and ozonation, as a barrier against Cryptosporidium parvum
   in drinking water treatment has underscored the increased importance of
   oocyst removal by filtration. Currently, no reliable surrogates have
   been identified for C. parvum removal by filtration. As a result,
   evaluations of the Cryptosporidium removal by treatment operations have
   been performed using oocysts. It has typically been assumed that
   chemically inactivated oocysts are suitable surrogates for viable
   oocysts. Measurements of. electrophoretic mobility, however, have shown
   that chemical inactivation changes the surface charge of Cryptosporidium
   oocysts. The present bench-scale research indicated that
   formalin-inactivated oocysts are reliable surrogates for viable oocysts
   during both stable filter operation and periods where filtration
   processes are challenged, such as coagulation failure. This finding is
   important because of the practical difficulties associated with using
   viable oocysts in filtration investigations. Poor coagulation conditions
   severely compromised removal of viable and inactivated oocysts by dual-
   and tri-media filters compared to stable operating conditions and filter
   ripening, emphasizing the importance of optimized chemical pre-treatment
   (coagulation) for the successful removal of oocysts during filtration.
   The treatment optimization experiments also indicated that tri-media
   filters offered only marginally higher oocyst removals than dual-media
   filters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated with two parallel single reactor intermittently
   aerated nitrification denitrification systems fed municipal wastewater
   as influent, that Microthrix parvicella bulking can be stimulated and
   cured by manipulating the ammonia concentration in the aerobic period
   (by inhibiting the nitrifiers) to high and low values respectively. The
   proliferation or not of M. parvicella is hypothesized to be due to their
   requirement for ammonia as a nitrogen source for growth. In terms of
   this hypothesis, if nitrification is rapid and complete, ammonia is not
   freely available and will limit M. parvicella growth. If nitrification
   is not complete for whatever reason, ammonia is available for the growth
   of the slow growing M. parvicella, enabling their proliferation to cause
   a bulking sludge. This hypothesis does not overturn or replace the
   anoxic-aerobic (AA, or low Food/Microorganism, F/M, ratio) filament
   bulking hypothesis of Casey et al. (Water SA 25(4) (1999) 425) but
   appears to be additional to it. Future research will focus on
   determining how elements of both hypotheses superimpose on the

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments have been conducted to elucidate the degradation
   of alpha-methylnaphthalene in lake sediments using an advanced oxidation
   process (AOP) employing peroxy-acids as oxidizing agents. Abiotic
   degradation of alpha-methylnaphthalene was observed in sediment samples
   exposed to a 1: 1: 1 v/v/v mixture of water/organic acid/hydrogen
   peroxide solution. Sediment samples were collected from Lake Macatawa
   (Holland, MI) and ranged in total organic carbon content from 2.1\%
   (sandy sediment sample III) to 12.8\% (silty-clay sediment sample 1) and
   surface area, which ranged from 3.2 m(2)/g (sandy sediment sample III)
   to 22.0 m(2)/g (Silty-clay sediment sample 1). Analytical measurements
   performed by gas chromatography revealed varied rates of degradation,
   depending on the type of acid and the characteristics of the sediment
   sample. Within 24 h, alpha-methylnaphthalene was reduced to 70\% and
   100\% of its original concentration when propionic acid and acetic acid
   were used as the organic acids, respectively. The formation of products
   was explored using a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass spectrometer
   and indicated mainly the formation of lower molecular weight compounds,
   such as alkyl chains. This AOP method of PAH degradation in
   sediment/liquid slurry was fast acting and products were most likely
   biodegradable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of a reactive color, Cibacron Yellow LS-R, from aqueous
   solutions by adsorption onto hydrotalcite particles is investigated
   using batch rate experiments. Measurements are performed at various
   initial color concentrations, solid loads, pH values and ionic
   backgrounds (dissolved NaCl). The speed of agitation and the temperature
   inside the batch adsorber are also varied within a practical range of
   values. It is shown that the sorption capacity is relatively high for
   most experimental conditions so hydrotalcite may be considered as a
   suitable sorbent for this application. The probable mechanism of the
   process is investigated by a number of homogeneous and heterogeneous
   reaction kinetic models as well as diffusion kinetic models. It is found
   that no single kinetic model can fully describe the sorption process at
   all times. At least three independent rate-controlling mechanisms appear
   to compete each other and dominate the different stages of sorption. (C)

Abstract = {{Nutrient (N and P), heavy metal (Ni, Cd, Cr, Cu and Pb) and pesticide
   (DDT, DDD, DDE, lindane, aldrin, endrin, dieldrin, permethrin, atrazine
   and simazine) concentrations in water and sediment were analysed in the
   Emporda Wetlands, a Mediterranean wetland area in NE Spain: Mean
   nutrient and contaminant concentrations and input and output loads via
   tributaries were compared in two marshes with different water turnover:
   a freshwater marsh (FWM), with a high water turnover rate due to
   continuous surface water inputs and outputs, and a brackish water marsh
   (BWM), with lower turnover and no continuous surface-output, where water
   remains confined during dry periods. Mean concentrations of most heavy
   metals exceeded the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) in BWM,
   whilst only some pesticides reached MPC in FWM. The confined waters of
   BWM showed higher sensitivity to contaminant input loadings than FWM due
   to the lack of continuous water outputs. Non-point source pollution
   inputs during runoff (mainly in FWM) and concentration during
   confinement (mainly in BWM) showed as the main environmental problems
   related to nutrients and contaminants in these ecosystems. Thus, the
   importance of confinement and its effect on pollutant concentrations
   must be borne in mind to achieve correct management of Mediterranean
   wetlands. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   conversion of thiophene was investigated in batch systems with

   was shown to stimulate the conversion of thiophene with a first-order

   were able to transform thiophene in the absence of benzene at a
   zero-order rate. Thiophene was converted to five oxidation products,
   regardless of the presence of benzene. Benzene had no influence on the
   distribution of these oxidation products. The main oxidation product, a
   thiophene sulphoxide dimer, represented 78+/-12\% of the transformed
   thiophene, while the second most important product, also a thiophene
   sulphoxide dimer, represented 20+/-2\% of the converted thiophene. (C)

Abstract = {{Water samples from lakes situated in and around the area of Tsukuba
   Science City, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, were analysed using synchronous
   fluorescence spectroscopy and HPLC. The spectra revealed a major
   emission peak (A,mm) at 340 nm corresponding to an excitation wavelength
   (lambda(exc)) position of 280 nm and a Stoke's shift, Deltalambda = 60
   nm. The fluorescence intensities at these wavelengths were normalised
   with respect to the water Raman peak, where the lambda(exc) was 397 nm
   and the lambda(emm) was 453 nm, and corrections were introduced to take
   into account absorption/re-absorption effects of the fluorescing signals
   caused by the sample matrix. Normalised fluorescence values correlate
   well with levels of tryptophan present in the samples determined by HPLC
   analysis (R-2 = 0.99). The relationship of the observed tryptophan-like
   fluorescence in the water samples to the presence of free tryptophan is
   discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work, the possibility of using chemical oxidation through
   Fenton's reagent for the pre-treatment of cork cooking wastewaters was
   exploited. Aiming both the selection of the best operating conditions
   (pH, Fe2+:H2O2 ratio and initial H2O2 concentration) and the evaluation
   of the overall reaction kinetics, trials were performed in a batch
   reactor. Operating at pH = 3.2, H2O2 concentration = 10.6 g/L and
   Fe2+:H2O2 ratio = 1:5 (by weight), about 66.4\% of total organic carbon
   (TOC), 87.3\% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 70.2\% of biochemical
   oxygen demand (BOD5) were removed and an increase of the BOD5/COD ratio
   from 0.27 to 0.63 was achieved. In the temperature range 20-50degreesC,
   the best performance was obtained at 30degreesC. The kinetic study was
   undertaken at different initial TOC concentrations and temperatures.
   Overall kinetics can be described by a second-order followed by a
   zero-order rate equation and the apparent kinetic constants at
   30degreesC are k = 2.3 x 10(-4) L/mg min and k(0) = 26.0 mg/L min,
   respectively. The experiments performed at different temperatures
   confirmed the global kinetic model and allowed to calculate the global
   activation energy for the second-order reaction (70.7 U/mol). (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The identification of denitrification in the Torgau sand and gravel
   aquifer, Germany, was carried out by a dual isotope method of measuring
   both the delta(15)N and delta(18)O in NO3-. Samples were prepared by an
   anion exchange resin method (Silva et al., J. Hydrol. 228 (2000) 22)
   with a modification to the AgNO3-drying process from a freeze-drying to
   an oven-drying method. The occurrence of denitrification in the aquifer
   was confirmed by comparing the reduction of dissolved oxygen, dissolved
   organic carbon and NO3- concentrations with the dual isotope signatures.
   High nitrate concentrations were associated with low delta(15)N and
   delta(18)O values, and vice versa. The denitrification accords with a
   Rayleigh equation with calculated enrichment factors of epsilon =
   -13.62parts per thousand for delta(15)N and epsilon = -9.80parts per
   thousand for delta(18)O. The slope of the straight-line relationship
   between the delta(15)N and delta(18)O data demonstrated that the
   enrichment of the heavy nitrogen isotope was higher by a factor of 1.3
   compared with the heavy oxygen isotope. It is concluded that the
   identification of this factor is a useful means for confirming
   denitrification in future groundwater studies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The isotherms and kinetics of adsorption of lead(II) and copper(II) onto
   a grafted silica are studied at 20degreesC. A commercial silica is
   grafted with an ethylediamine derivative,
   N-{[}3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]-ethylenediamine. From the Langmuir
   isotherms, maximum adsorption capacities of the grafted silica towards
   Pb(II) and Cu(II) are determined (0.184 mmol Pb(II)g(-1) and 0.261 mmol
   Cu(II)g(-1)) and compared to those of non-modified silica (respectively,
   0.019 and 0.036 mmol g(-1)). Four kinetic models, i.e., pseudo-first
   order, pseudo-second order, Langmuir and double-exponential are applied
   to fit the experimental kinetic data. The kinetic parameters are
   determined which allow to calculate the theoretical metal uptake as a
   function of time. The results are discussed and indicate the best fit is
   obtained with the double-exponential model. A discussion on the
   adsorption mechanism with respect to the double-exponential model leads
   to two possible interpretations: the metal uptake may follow a
   diffusion-controlled mechanism or a two-site adsorption process. (C)

Abstract = {{Mineral precipitation problems have been experienced with the conveyance
   and treatment of anaerobically digested primary and waste activated
   sludge blends. This paper describes an experimental investigation into
   mineral precipitation in anaerobic digester liquor (ADL) from the Cape
   Flats (CF) Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) (Cape Town, South Africa),
   and application of the three-phase (aqueous/solid/gas) physical and
   chemical processes kinetic model developed by Musvoto et al. (Water Res.
   34 (2000) 1857; Water Res. 34 (2000) 1868; Water SA 26(4) (2000) 417) to
   the experimental data. From the experimental investigation and
   theoretical modelling, it is concluded inter alia that: (i) there is a
   close correlation between experimental measured and theoretically
   predicted data, (ii) the dominating mineral that precipitates is
   struvite, with small amounts of amorphous calcium phosphate and
   negligible newberyite, calcite and magnesite, (iii) the precipitation of
   struvite is governed by the increase in pH when CO2 is lost from the
   ADL, (iv) the ADL is initially undersaturated with respect to struvite,
   but becomes supersaturated at pH > 7.3-7.7, (v) the rate and mass of
   struvite precipitation are controlled by the rate of pH increase and the
   initial Mg concentration and (vi) the three-phase kinetic model is able
   to simulate accurately the time dependent precipitation data for
   multiple minerals competing for the same species and allows
   determination of specific precipitation rates for a number of minerals
   simultaneously in an integrated manner from a single batch test. Some
   operational strategies to minimise struvite precipitation are proposed.

Abstract = {{Azo dye reduction results from a combination of biotic and abiotic
   processes during the anaerobic treatment of dye containing effluents.
   Biotic processes are due to enzymatic reactions whereas the chemical
   reaction is due to sulfide. In this research, the relative impact of the
   different azo dye reduction mechanisms was determined by investigating
   the reduction of Acid Orange 7 (AO7) and Reactive Red 2 (RR2) under
   different conditions. Reduction rates of two azo dyes were compared in
   batch assays over a range of sulphide concentrations in the presence of
   living or inactivated anaerobic granular sludge. Biological dye
   reduction followed zero order kinetics and chemical dye reduction
   followed second-order rate kinetics as a function of sulfide and dye
   concentration. Chemical reduction of the dyes was greatly stimulated in
   the presence of autoclaved sludge; whereas chemical dye reduction was
   not affected by living or gamma-irradiated-sludge. Presumably
   redox-mediating enzyme cofactors released by cell lysis contributed to
   the stimulatory effect. This hypothesis was confirmed in assays
   evaluating the chemical reduction of AO7 utilizing riboflavin,
   representative of the heat stable redox-mediating moieties of common
   occurring flavin enzyme cofactors. Sulfate influenced dye reduction in
   accordance to biogenic sulfide formation from sulfate reduction. In
   assays lacking sulfur compounds, dye reduction only readily occurred in
   the presence of living granular sludge, demonstrating the importance of
   enzymatic mechanisms. Both chemical and biological mechanisms of dye
   reduction were greatly stimulated by the addition of the redox-mediating
   compound, anthraquinone-disulfonate. Based on an analysis of the
   kinetics and demonstration in lab-scale upward-flow anaerobic sludge bed
   reactors, the relative importance of chemical dye reduction mechanisms
   in high rate anaerobic bioreactors was shown to be small due to the high
   biomass levels in the reactors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The influence of the addition of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl
   sulphate (SDS) to the soil-water-linuron system in the herbicide
   desorption from soils with different organic matter (OM) content to
   water have been studied. SIDS was used at critical micelle
   concentrations (cmc) of 0.75, 1.50, 5 and 10. The adsorption-desorption
   isotherms of linuron in aqueous medium and in SDS solutions at
   concentration of 0.75 cmc fitted the Freundlich adsorption equation for
   all the soils studied. When the SDS concentration was 1.50 cmc only the
   desorption isotherms for the soils with OM content less than or equal to
   5.40\% fit this equation and was not fulfilled by any of the soils when
   the SDS concentration was 5 or 10 cmc. All the desorption isotherms
   displayed hysteresis, the hysteresis coefficients of the desorption
   isotherms in SDS solutions always being lower than those of the
   desorption isotherms in water. The efficiency coefficients, defined as
   the relationship between the percentages of linuron desorbed in SDS
   solution and the percentages of linuron desorbed in water, range from
   1.02 to 2.41 in the soil with the lowest OM content, and from 1.91 to
   17.1 in the soil with the highest OM content. The results obtained
   indicate the enhancement of linuron desorption by the addition of SDS
   surfactant to soil-water system. The efficiency of SDS is seen as from
   surfactant concentrations below the cmc and varies with the surfactant
   concentration and with the soil OM content. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We studied the electrochemical oxidation, on Pt anodes, of industrial
   wastewaters containing 5-amino-6-methyl-2-benzimidazolone (AMBI).
   Electrolysis of this non-biodegradable effluent produces simultaneous
   oxidation of AMBI and chloride ions. Highly oxidative chlorine
   intermediate species further boost the degradation of AMBI. Solution
   temperature, pH and current density affect little the degradation of
   AMBI. At our best conditions, AMBI was 100\% degraded in 45 min.
   However, because the reaction intermediates exhibited high toxicity and
   non-biodegradability, the electrolysis had to continue for 3 more hours
   in order to obtain a biocompatible solution. Then, complete
   mineralization of the outputs from the electrolytic cells was readily
   achieved in a fixed bed biological reactor. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Dynamic response of nitrifying activated sludge batch cultures to
   increased chloride concentration was studied in this paper, which
   focused upon the changes in the specific nitrification rate (SNR) and
   nitrifier population when the chloride level was gradually or stepwise
   increased to 30,000 mg Cl L-1. The dominant species of ammonia-oxidizers
   and nitrite-oxidizers in the population were examined by Fluorescent in
   situ hybridization technique with 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide
   probes. It was found that neither chloride increasing approaches
   affected the SNR of the batch cultures before the chloride concentration
   exceeded 10,000 mg Cl L-1, after which the stepwise increase approach
   reduced the SNR more significantly than the gradual increase approach.
   From 10,000 to 18,000 mg Cl L-1 a down-and-up pattern of the SNR
   variation appeared in both approaches, which was associated with the
   change in the dominant species of ammonia-oxidizers from
   non-saline-resistant species such as Nitrosomonas europaea-lineage and
   Nitrosomonas eutropha to saline-resistant species, such as the
   Nitrosococcus mobilis-lineage. Nitrobacter was the only dominant species
   when the chloride concentration was below 10,000 mg Cl L-1, where no
   nitrite-oxidizers survived. Therefore, the 10,000 mg Cl L-1 chloride
   level is a critical level for the shift of the nitrifier population in
   the nitrifying activated sludge batch cultures. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Laboratory anaerobic and aerobic digestion studies were conducted using
   waste activated sludges from two municipal wastewater treatment plants
   in order to gain insight into the mechanisms of floc destruction that
   account for changes in sludge conditioning and dewatering properties
   when sludges undergo anaerobic and aerobic digestion. Batch digestion
   studies were conducted at 20degreesC and the dewatering properties,
   solution biopolymer concentration and conditioning dose requirements
   measured. The data indicated that release of biopolymer from sludges
   occurred under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions but that the
   release was much greater under anaerobic conditions. In particular, the
   release of protein into solution was 4-5 times higher under anaerobic
   than under aerobic conditions. Both the dewatering rate, as
   characterized by the specific resistance to filtration and the amount of
   polymer conditioning chemicals required was found to depend directly on
   the amount of biopolymer (protein + polysaccharide) in solution. Little
   difference in dewatering properties and conditioning doses was seen
   between the two activated sludges from different plants. Differences in
   the cations released between anaerobic and aerobic digestion suggest
   that the digestion mechanisms differ for the two types of processes.
   Enyzme activity data showed that during aerobic digestion,
   polysaccharide degradation activity decreased to near zero and this was
   consistent with the accumulation of polysaccharides in aerobic
   digesters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations and removal rate of Triclosan, an antibacterial
   ingredient in consumer products, were measured at advanced trickling
   filter (TF) and activated sludge (AS) wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs) in the River Aire basin in the UK in September 2000.
   Additionally, the in-stream removal of Triclosan was measured directly
   in Mag Brook, the stream receiving the treated effluent from the TF
   plant, using a fluorescent dye tracer to determine the water plug travel
   times. The in-stream removal of the dissolved and un-ionized (i.e.
   bioavailable) fraction of the compound was measured using semipermeable
   membrane devices (SPMDs) deployed at various distances downstream from
   the WWTP discharge point. The estimated removal rates were used in the
   GREAT-ER (Geography-Referenced Regional Exposure Assessment Tool for
   European Rivers) model to predict the site-specific distribution of
   Triclosan concentrations in the Aire basin as well as to calculate
   regional concentrations. High WWTP (similar to95\%) and in-stream
   (0.21-0.33 h(-1)) removal rates of Triclosan in Mag Brook confirm that
   this chemical is rapidly eliminated from the aquatic environment. (C)

Abstract = {{This study focused on the sonochemical degradation of
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and chromium-EDTA complexes.
   Degradation of the copper(II)-EDTA complex was also investigated as a
   comparison metal complex. A 90\% degradation of a 150-muM EDTA solution
   with continuous O-2-bubbling was shown for the 20-kHz system in
   approximately 3 h (k(pseudo-first) (order) = 1.22 x 10(-2) min(-1)) and
   less than 1 h for the 354-kHz system (k(pseudo-first) (order) = 5.42 x
   10(-2) min(-1)). These results are consistent with the higher
   concentrations of hydrogen peroxide found in the higher frequency system
   and an expected oxidation of EDTA in bulk solution. The presence of a
   chelated metal decreased the rate of degradation at both frequencies.
   Cr(III)-EDTA degraded the slowest, supporting the theory that the
   extremely slow ligand exchange rate of chromium is the determining
   factor in how fast degradation by hydroxyl radical can occur. The
   354-kHz system showed a 17\% decrease in the original 150-muM
   Cr(III)-EDTA complex after 3 h of sonication. All of the chromium from
   the degraded EDTA complex existed as a combination of oxidized Cr(VI)
   and possibly small amounts of a new Cr(III)-organic complex (Cr(III)-Y).
   The 20-kHz system showed a similar extent of degradation (16\%) after 3
   h of sonication, despite lower hydroxyl radical production. Fifty
   percent of the chromium from the degraded EDTA complex was found as free
   Cr3+ ion, with the remaining 50\% existing as both Cr(III)-Y and Cr(VI).
   Varying degrees of bulk oxidation, near-bubble thermolysis, and perhaps
   different degradation pathways at the two frequencies are responsible
   for these differences. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of ozonation on the biodegradability of 100-ppm aqueous
   solutions of 2,4-dichlorophenol has been investigated. BOD at 5, 10 and
   21 days, BOD/COD and BOD/TOC ratios and the average oxidation state are
   presented. Biodegradability measured as BOD5/COD ratio was increased
   from 0 of the original solution to 0.25 at the moment of removing all
   the initial compound (corresponding to an ozone dose of 0.12 g L-1, 0.48
   for BOD21/COD ratio). To test the effect of this pre-treatment, the
   biological oxidation of these pre-ozonated solutions was performed in
   two semi-continuous stirred tank reactors, one with non-acclimated
   sludge and one with acclimated-to-phenol sludge. The study showed that
   the TOC content of the pre-treated solution could be removed up to 68\%
   by an aerobic biological treatment as well as co-digested with municipal
   wastewater (TOC removal up to 82\%), with similar operating retention
   times to a municipal wastewater plant (12-24 h). Kinetic studies based
   on Monod model have also been carried out. Pseudo-first-order kinetic
   constants were found to be in the range of 0.5-0.8 L g TVSS-1 h(-1). (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, the Fenton process was used to explore the possibility of
   treating explosives, namely 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (PA), ammonium
   picronitrate (AP), 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT),
   methyl-2,4,6-trinitrophenylnitramine (Tetryl) and 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene
   (TNT), hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) and
   octahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX). The photo-Fenton
   process was also conducted to compare its oxidation efficiency with the
   Fenton process. The inhibition of hydroxyl radical and theory of crystal
   field stabilization energy were introduced in this study. Results show
   that oxidation efficiencies in Fenton system are in the following
   sequence: DNT > PA > AP > TNT > Tetryl > RDX > HMX. The degradation of
   the explosives obeys a pseudo-first-order behavior, and possible
   decomposing mechanisms are also discussed. For all explosives, the
   oxidation rates significantly increased with increasing the
   concentration of Fe(II), as well as illumination with UV light. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{TiO2-catalyst suspensions work efficiently in photocatalysis for
   wastewater treatment. Nevertheless, once photocatalysis is complete,
   separation of the catalyst from solution becomes the main problem.
   Catalyst recovery has been enhanced through charge neutralisation and
   coagulation with electrolytes at lab and pilot-plant scale (40 L) to
   evaluate the potential for its separation after photocatalytic
   degradation of pollutants. Zeta-potential analysis showed that the
   isoelectric point (IEP) of TiO2 suspensions is near pH 7. Settling rates
   and hydrodynamic diameter of TiO2 particles are maximum at the IEP.
   However, suspensions are stable at different pH. TiO2 was reused in
   solar photocatalysis pilot-plant (40 L) for treatment of
   tetrachloroethylene (C2Cl4) comparing two procedures: reuse of the
   entire suspension after destruction of the organics without separation
   of the catalyst, and reuse of the catalyst after it had settled to the
   bottom and clear water had been removed. Photocatalytic efficiency
   worsens with successive runs when catalyst and water are reused without
   separation, whereas, when TiO2 is separated, the photocatalyst is not
   deactivated. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Vitamin B-12 is an important component of media used to stimulate the
   growth of many anaerobic microbes that dechlorinate aliphatic compounds.
   Its delivery to the subsurface is therefore a concern for enhanced in
   situ bioremediation and bioaugmentation. In situ circulation of vitamin
   B12 and a chemical reductant has also been field tested for treatment of
   chlorinated methanes, ethanes, and ethenes. The objective of this study
   was to determine the extent of B12 (added as cyanocobalamin) adsorption
   to aquifer solids. Batch studies indicated a minor amount of adsorption
   to kaolinite clay (Freundlich K-f = 1.5 (mug/g) (mL/mug)(1/n) and 1/n =
   0.39) and sand (K-f = 0.70 (mug/g) (mL/ mug)(1/n) and 1/n = 0.84), and
   no detectable adsorption to alumina. Column studies using a (H2O)-H-3
   tracer and vitamin B-12 in distilled water (10muM) resulted in a B-12
   retardation factor (R) of approximately 2 for both sand (0.14\% organic
   carbon) and a sandy soil (2w.5\% organic carbon). Using groundwater
   containing organic carbon (2.8 mg/L) in place of distilled water did not
   significantly change R. The relatively low value for R indicates vitamin
   B-12 can be distributed throughout a contaminated aquifer without
   experiencing significant losses to adsorption. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Precipitation and inactivation of phosphorus (P) by the addition of
   aluminum (Al) is a widely applied lake restoration measure. Many studies
   about short-term effects are reported, but little is known about
   long-term effects. To reduce this lack of knowledge we investigated the
   German hardwater lake, Susser See, which was treated almost annually
   from 1977 to 1992 with aluminum sulfate (alum). We conducted sediment
   core experiments in laboratory, as well as in situ investigations of
   sediment and pore water. The treatment is clearly recognizable in
   sediment depth profiles as increases of total phosphorus,
   NaOH-extractable phosphorus, and NaOH-extractable aluminum. The molar
   ratio of added Al to additionally bound P is approximately 2.1:1. Pore
   water profiles of soluble reactive phosphorus taken in situ and in
   sediment core experiments, as well as sorption batch experiments,
   illustrate that the Al(OH)(3) layer's sorptive capacity is still not
   exhausted with further P sorption occurring in different P fractions.
   The P release of the sediment is affected by the magnitude of the
   downward flux into the P sorbing layer. However, sediment core
   experiments and a modeling exercise indicate that a buried P sorbing
   layer has little or no effect on the P release of the uppermost fresh
   sediment layers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The transformation by an oxidoreductase (a laccase from Rhus
   vernificera) of a mixture of four phenols (catechol, methylcatechol,
   m-tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol) that simulates a typical wastewater
   derived from an olive oil factory was investigated. Results achieved in
   this study confirm that laccase-mediated transformation of phenols
   depends on the nature and the initial concentration of the involved
   phenol, the time course of the reaction, and mainly, on the complexity
   of the phenolic incubation mixture. Actually, the four phenols each have
   a completely different response to enzyme action both in terms of
   quantitative and kinetic transformation. For example, after 24-h
   incubation, methylcatechol was completely removed, whereas 30\% of
   untransformed hydroxytyrosol and catechol and more than 65\% of
   m-tyrosol were still present in the reaction mixture. A reduction of
   enzyme activity occurred for all phenols after enzymatic oxidation. No
   correspondence between phenol transformation and disappearance of
   enzymatic activity was observed, thus suggesting that different
   mechanisms are probably involved in the laccase-mediated transformation
   of the four phenols. The behavior of phenols became more complex when an
   increasing number of phenols was present in the reaction mixture, and
   even more so when different concentrations of phenols were used.
   Competitive effects may arise when more than one phenol is present in
   the reaction solution and interacts with the enzyme. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Nitrate-accumulating filamentous bacteria from organic rich sediment of
   Tokyo Bay, morphologically similar to Beggiatoa species, were
   phylogenctically analyzed. From several sites in Tokyo Bay,
   Beggiatoa-like bacteria were collected. Each sample contained narrower
   or wider type (10 and 30 mum, respectively) of trichomes. With the
   nested PCR using specific primers for Beggiatoa, fragments of 16S rRNA
   gene were amplified and then subjected to denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Sequencing and the following
   phylogenetic analysis indicated that they are related to large Beggiatoa
   species. The wider type was related to uncultured Beggiatoa clones of
   other geographical localities and distinct from the narrower type in
   Tokyo Bay. Among the narrower types, a sample from a tidal flat was
   genetically distinct from the sample from sites of 10 and 20 m water
   depth. These narrower types form a new branch in Beggiatoa/Thioploca
   cluster. The result of phylogenetic analysis was in accordance with the
   previous studies that indicate possession of nitrate-accumulation
   capability is congruent with phylogeny based on 16S rRNA sequences. (C)

Abstract = {{Although activated sludge systems with enhanced biological phosphorus
   removal (EBPR) represent state-of-the-art technology for phosphate
   removal from wastewater it is still unknown which species of bacteria
   are responsible for the EBPR process.
   The aim of this study was to compare the bacterial composition of
   activated sludge from two laboratory plants with different modes of
   operation, anoxic/oxic- (EBPR, no nitrification) and Phoredox-system
   (EBPR, nitrification and denitrification) with particular emphasis on
   microorganisms responsible for EBPR process. In addition to fluorescence
   in situ hybridization (FISH), we applied further rRNA-based molecular
   techniques like terminal restriction-fragment length polymorphism
   analysis and comparative 16S rDNA analysis to yield additional
   information and to verify the results from FISH analysis, like e.g. for
   the identification of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO).
   Despite the different modes of operation only minor differences in the
   bacterial composition were detected by FISH analysis based on the probes
   used in this study. In contrast T-RFLP analysis yielded characteristic
   community fingerprints for each of the investigated plants and
   comparative 16S rDNA analysis indicated highly diverse microbial
   communities in both plants suggesting substantial differences in the
   microbial structure.
   The results obtained by FISH analysis with specific probes for PAOs
   support the presumption that not only one specific organism is
   responsible for the EBPR. In our case Tetrasphaera spp. dominated the
   PAO community, but other possible PAOs, like Microlunatus spp. and
   members of the Rhodocyclus group, were also detected. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In the summer 2001, the microbiological water quality of two contiguous
   urban coastal beaches (Porto, Portugal) was surveyed for 18 consecutive
   days. The sampling strategy consisted in sampling surface water in early
   morning, noon and afternoon. A total of 184 samples were processed at
   Pastoras beach, a confined area between two jetties, and Ourigo Beach
   more open to the ocean. At the first beach site, all samples exceeded
   fecal contamination above guide values (GV) and 82.6\% above mandatory
   values (MV) set out in the EU Bathing Water Directive; whereas at
   Pastoras Beach, the figures were 93.5\% for GV and 26.1\% for MV,
   showing a potential health risk. The periodicity of fecal indicators in
   raw sewage, the tidal status and wind conditions dramatically influenced
   the water quality. The quality decreased in the morning regardless of
   tide conditions, but improved subsequently during the day, particularly
   during high tide and under the influence of afternoon NW winds. These
   dynamics are incompatible with the fortnight routine sampling according
   to the recommendations of the EU Bathing W ater Directive, and the
   strategy should be revised on a beach-to-beach basis, having in mind the
   profile for the coastal zone. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The occurrence and the fate of trihalomethanes (THMs) in the water
   supply system of Hanoi City, Vietnam was investigated from 1998 to 2001.
   The chlorination efficiency, THM speciation, and, THM formation
   potential (THMFP) was determined in the water works and in tap water.
   With regard to THM formation, three types of groundwater resources were
   identified: (I) high bromide, (II) low bromide, and (III) high bromide
   combined with high ammonia and high dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   concentrations. Under typical treatment conditions (total chlorine
   residual 0.5-0.8 mg/L), the total THM formation was always below WHO,
   EU, and USEPA drinking water standards and decreased in the order type I
   > type II > type III, although the THMFP was > 400 mug/L for type III
   water. The speciation showed > 80\% of bromo-THMs in type I water due to
   the noticeable high bromide level (less than or equal to 140 mug/L). In
   type II water, the bromo-THMs still accounted for some 40\% although the
   bromide concentration is significantly lower (less than or equal to 30
   mug/L). In contrast, only traces of bromo-THMs were formed (similar to
   5\%) in type III water, despite bromide levels were high (less than or
   equal to 240 mug/L). This observation could be explained by competition
   kinetics of chlorine reacting with ammonia and bromide. Based on
   chlorine exposure (CT) estimations, it was concluded that the current
   chlorination practice for type I and II waters is sufficient for greater
   than or equal to2-log inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts. However, in
   type III water the applied chlorine is masked as chloramine with a much
   lower disinfection efficiency. In addition to high levels of ammonia,
   type III groundwater is also contaminated by arsenic that is not
   satisfactory removed during treatment. N-nitro sodimethylamine, a
   potential carcinogen suspected to be formed during chloramination
   processes, was below the detection limit of 0.02 mug/L in type III
   water. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Two wild fish populations (Mullus surmuletus (striped red mullet) as a

   (31.1 +/- 7.96 mug mg(-1) proteins). Metal levels are statistically
   different between all tissues. Highest metal concentrations are in liver
   cytosols, especially of Cu in L. aurata (6.46 +/- 3.45 mug ml(-1) S50).
   High positive correlation of NIT and cytosolic metals is established
   with Zn in liver of M. surmuletus (0.95) and with Cu in liver of L.

Abstract = {{Ribotyping is one of a number of genotypic methods for bacterial source
   tracking. This method requires a host origin database of one bacterial
   species be established in order to identify environmental isolates.
   Researchers establishing these databases have observed considerable
   ribotype diversity within a specific bacterial species. One source of
   this diversity may be diet. We determined the effect of diet on ribotype
   diversity for Escherichia coli in penned and wild deer (Odocoileus
   virginianus) in a 13-ha forested watershed. A total of 298 E coli
   isolates was obtained, 100 from penned deer, 100 from wild deer, and 98
   from the stream in the watershed to which all deer had access. The wild
   deer had significantly more ribotypes (35) than the penned deer (11
   ribotypes, p = 0.05). This result suggests that diet affected ribotype
   diversity, and that a host origin database for bacterial source tracking
   should contain bacterial isolates from wild rather than from captive
   animals. Also, 42 of 98 (42.9\%) environmental isolates matched penned
   and wild deer ribotypes. If bacterial source tracking determines that
   fecal contamination is predominantly from wildlife, then it may be
   unnecessary to monitor these watersheds because control over wildlife is
   difficult. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to conduct treatability studies on rinse
   wastewater from process lines of a typical nickel-plating plant for
   reuse. The study comprised of three steps: (1) a plant process review
   and the treatability of different combinations of simulated spent rinses
   in the laboratory; (2) a variability monitoring of a combined rinse at
   the plant and a treatability study on a combined rinse in the
   laboratory; (3) a pilot study for reclamation of the combined rinse on
   site. The study established an optimum dual membrane ultrafiltration
   (UF)/reverse osmosis (RO) process for treating a combined liquor of
   spent alkaline, acidic and nickel-plating rinses which resulted in a
   treated water of a quality suitable for reuse as substitute for town
   water for the purpose of rinsing. The results of this study provided a
   good guide to the selection of a UF pretreatment combined with an RO
   membrane unit as the treatment system. The pilot plant had successfully
   operated for 6 months, consistently producing a high quality product
   water (< 95 muS cm(-1)) at an overall water recovery of 67.5\%. The
   quality of reclaimed water was better than town water used at the
   factory. The product water from the pilot plant has been used as
   substitute of town water for in-process rinsing at the factory with no
   detrimental effects for 3 months. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Because of the kinetics of diffusion limitation and the difficulty of
   replicating biofilm structure in a test vessel, biokinetic parameters of
   substrate consumption (maximum specific substrate removal rate, q(m) and
   half-maximum removal coefficient, K-s) are particularly difficult to
   measure in biofilm reactors. In this research, a type curve method using
   load-shift experiments was compared to a method using a least-squared
   errors (LSE) routine. More accurate and precise estimates were obtained
   with the LSE routine than with the type curve method by removing
   subjectivity from the estimation process. In addition, the LSE
   estimation process allowed a more rigorous evaluation of the adequacy of
   the data fit, permitted estimation of approximate confidence intervals
   of parameters, and identified flaws in the data set. As a result, we
   advocate the use of the recently developed LSE based estimation routine
   to estimate parameters from such experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Phosphonates are anthropogenic complexing agents containing one or more
   C-PO(OH)(2) groups. They are used in numerous technical and industrial
   applications as chelating agents and scale inhibitors. Phosphonates have
   properties that differentiate them from other chelating agents and that
   greatly affect their environmental behavior. Phosphonates have a very
   strong interaction with surfaces, which results in a significant removal
   in technical and natural systems. Due to this strong adsorption, little
   or no remobilization of metals is expected. No biodegradation of
   phosphonates during water treatment is observed but photodegradation of
   the Fe(III)-complexes is rapid. Aminopolyphosphonates are also rapidly
   oxidized in the presence of Mn(II) and oxygen and stable breakdown
   products are formed that have been detected in wastewater. The lack of
   information about phosphonates in the environment is linked to
   analytical problems of their determination at trace concentrations in
   natural waters. Further method development is urgently needed in this
   area, including speciation of these compounds. With the current
   knowledge on speciation, we can conclude that phosphonates are mainly
   present as Ca and Mg-complexes in natural waters and therefore do not
   affect metal speciation or transport. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Populations of Moina micrura and Brachionus rubens in a deep waste
   treatment pond were exposed to the natural short-term fluctuations of
   unionised ammonia (90-min intervals of monitoring) that occur in the
   course of a day during a summer algal bloom. Under natural conditions,
   three replicate experiments were conducted in which water temperature,
   pH, dissolved oxygen, total ammonia, unionised ammonia, phytoplankton
   biomass and zooplankton (number of living and dead organisms, mortality
   rate and instant mortality) were studied. The time-course of unionised
   ammonia concentration was consistent with those shown by temperature,
   pH, phytoplankton biomass, dissolved oxygen, Moina micrura mortality and
   Brachionus rubens mortality. On the other hand, temperature, pH and
   dissolved oxygen never exceeded the tolerance ranges described for Moina
   and Brachionus, which led us to attribute the cause of zooplankton
   mortality to unionised ammonia toxicity. Mortality rates of 63\%, 27\%
   and 34\% were recorded for Moina in each replicate experiment.
   Brachionus was less affected, with mortalities of 7.3\%, 6.2\% and
   6.0\%.
   These results confirm previous field observations (Water Res. 34(14)
   (2000) 3666; Water Res. 37(5) (2003) 1048) that attributed a reduction
   in zooplankton biomass during certain periods of summer (algal blooms)
   to a harmful side-effect of an excessive increase in phytoplankton
   biomass: high photosynthetic activity during these periods of
   proliferation of algae gives rise to an increased pH (greater than or
   equal to8) and, subsequently, leads to production of unionised ammonia
   (toxic for aquatic organisms) from its ionised fraction. (C) 2003

Title = {{Effect of feeding pattern and storage on the sludge settleability under
   aerobic conditions}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2555-2570}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The selection of filamentous bacteria is often assumed to be associated
   with specific microbial properties such as growth rate, substrate uptake
   rate, substrate affinity and potential for substrate storage. In this
   study we aimed to verify some of these factors. Sequencing batch reactor
   (SBR) systems were used to scale-down aerobic activated sludge systems
   with an aerobic selector. Adding acetate in different aerobic feeding
   periods allowed us to simulate a variable relative size of aerobic
   selector with different bulk liquid substrate concentrations. The
   experiments showed that as expected, the aerobic fill time ratio (FTRox)
   and the corresponding feast period, which can be assumed similar to
   contact time in an aerobic selector, had a strong effect on the sludge
   settleability. Promoting a strong substrate gradient in the SBR (FTRox <
   5.4\%) resulted in good sludge settleability (SVI < 120 mL g(-1)).
   Whenever acetate was added in a limiting rate (FTRox > 6.2\%), a
   condition in which the acetate concentration in the reactor was always
   very low, the sludge settleability decreased (SVI > 150 mL g(-1)).
   Sludge settleability could be improved by changing the feeding strategy
   to a pulse feed. The maximum specific acetate uptake rate and poly
   beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) production rate of bad settling sludge,
   including bulking sludge, was similar to well-settling sludge, which is
   not in accordance with the general assumptions that well settling sludge
   have a higher maximal substrate uptake rate and better storage
   capacities. An alternative hypothesis for the development of filamentous
   structures in biological floes has been formulated. It is hypothesized
   that bulking sludge originates from the presence of substrate gradients
   in sludge aggregates. Whereas at low bulk liquid substrate concentration
   filamentous bacteria give easier access to the substrate at the outside
   of the floes and thereby proliferate, at high bulk liquid substrate
   concentration there is no substrate advantage for filamentous organisms
   and smooth bacterial structures predominate. In this hypothesis there is
   no need for an intrinsic difference in kinetic parameters between floe
   and filamentous bacteria. Where presence of filamentous bacteria is
   related to process conditions, the presence of a specific filament is
   likely due to presence of a specific limiting substrate. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Blockages caused by inorganic precipitates are a major problem of
   urine-collecting systems. The trigger of precipitation is the hydrolysis
   of urea by bacterial urease. While the maximum amount of precipitates,
   i.e. the precipitation potential, can be estimated with equilibrium
   calculations, little is known about the dynamics of ureolysis and
   precipitation. To gain insight in these processes, we performed batch
   experiments with precipitated solids and stored urine from a
   urine-collecting system and later simulated the results with a computer
   model. We found that urease-active bacteria mainly grow in the pipes and
   are flushed into the collection tank. Both, bacteria and free urease,
   hydrolyse urea. Only few days are necessary for complete urea depletion
   in the collection tank. Two experiments with precipitated solids from
   the pipes showed that precipitation sets in soon after ureolysis has
   started. At the end of the experiments, 11\% and 24\% of urea was
   hydrolysed while the mass concentration of newly formed precipitates
   already corresponded to 87\% and 97\% of the precipitation potential,
   respectively. We could simulate ureolysis and precipitation with a
   computer model based on the surface dislocation approach. The
   simulations showed that struvite and octacalcium phosphate (OCP) are the
   precipitating minerals. While struvite precipitates already at low
   supersaturation, OCP precipitation starts not until a high level of
   supersaturation is reached. Since measurements and computer simulations
   show that hydroxyapatite (HAP) is the final calcium phosphate mineral in
   urine solutions, OCP is only a precursor phase which slowly transforms
   into HAP. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Dynamic behavior of ozonation with pollutant in a countercurrent bubble
   column with oxygen mass transfer}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic behavior of ozonation with pollutants in a countercurrent
   bubble column is studied for the model establishment. Bubble columns
   have been widely used for an ozonation system in the plants and
   laboratories. In addition, a countercurrent bubble column has been
   commonly recommended than a cocurrent one because it has a higher ozone
   transfer efficiency. Therefore, the investigation of this paper focuses
   on the countercurrent bubble column. As an ozonation process starts, the
   gas mixture of ozone and oxygen is introduced into the bottom of a
   column, and then transferred into the liquid. The pollutants in the
   wastewater are eliminated subsequently via oxidation by the dissolved
   ozone. There certainly exists a temporary and unsteady period before the
   ozonation system reaches steady state. However, available ozonation
   models employed to describe ozone and pollutant profiles have commonly
   been developed for steady state. The treating qualities of wastewater in
   the early stage of ozonation are usually not predicted, and the time
   required for the steady-state establishment remains to be determined.
   Moreover, oxygen mass transfer is usually neglected in previous
   ozonation models so that the increase of dissolved oxygen is uncertain.
   These information is desirable for the proper design and operation of
   ozonation system in a bubble column. Thus, the aim of this study is to
   model and investigate the dynamic processes of ozonation with pollutants
   including oxygen mass transfer. The dynamic axial dispersion model
   proposed is employed to predict the variation of the ozone, pollutant,
   and oxygen concentrations profiles. The validity of the model was
   demonstrated by comparing the predicted results with the experimental
   data. The o-cresol was chosen as the model pollutant. The temporal
   concentration variations of the residual o-cresol and dissolved oxygen
   in the effluent liquid, and the off-gas ozone in the free volume were
   measured accordingly. Furthermore, the variation of the enhancement
   factor of ozone and the amount of off-gas were predicted. Note that it
   usually needs 2-5 hydraulic retention times to approach steady state
   under the conditions of this study. Further, the effects of
   dimensionless system parameters on the performance of the ozonation
   processes are examined. As a result, the proposed dynamic model of
   ozonation with pollutants is useful for proper prediction of the
   variables of an ozonation system in a countercurrent bubble column. (C)

Abstract = {{In this study, the molecular composition of dissolved organic matter
   (DOM), collected from wetlands of the Southern Everglades, was examined
   using a variety of analytical techniques in order to characterize its
   sources and transformation in the environment. The methods applied for
   the characterization of DOM included fluorescence spectroscopy, solid
   state C-13 CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, and pyrolysis-GC/MS. The relative
   abundance of protein-like components and carbohydrates increased from
   the canal site to more remote freshwater marsh sites suggesting that
   significant amounts of non-humic DOM are autochthonously produced within
   the freshwater marshes, and are not exclusively introduced through canal
   inputs. Such in situ DOM production is important when considering how
   DOM from canals is processed and transported to downstream estuaries of
   Florida Bay. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Documentation is required to evaluate the use of infiltration systems as
   an alternative method for removal of fish pathogenic bacteria in
   wastewater from fish-farms. This study was performed to investigate the
   removal of bacterial fish pathogens in biological sand filters. A second
   aim of the study was to evaluate the bacteria used in the study in order
   to find a suitable model organism for future experiments. Low-strength
   wastewater from an inland freshwater salmonid farm was intermittently
   loaded (70mm/day in 24 doses) to filter columns containing either fine
   sand (d(10)=0.25) or coarse sand (d(10)=0.86). After a wastewater
   loading period of 10 weeks, separate sand columns were seeded with
   Yersinia ruckeri, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aeromonas hydrophila and
   Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, respectively, for a period of
   30 days. All the bacteria showed the same removal performance during the
   experiment, with a significantly lower removal in the beginning of the
   experiment (day 1-7) compared to mid- and late-phase (day 12-30). In
   mid- and late-phase the removal stabilized at a high level (>99.9\%) for
   all the bacteria. The hydrophobic cell surface properties of the
   Aeromonads were higher than Ps. fluorescens and Y. ruckeri. This can
   possibly explain the significantly higher (P<0.05) removal efficiencies
   seen for A. hydrophila and A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida compared to
   Y. ruckeri and Ps. fluorescens. Results were promising with regard to
   the use of low-cost infiltration systems as an alternative disinfection
   method for fish-farm wastewater. Following the criteria for a suitable
   model organism (removal efficiency, detection in filter effluent and
   die-off in storage tanks), Y ruckeri was found to be a feasible model
   organism for use in future experiments. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   day/night and weekday/weekend DOC regimes along the plant. Samples were
   centrifuged before DOC determination or estimation. Four components were
   selected for describing wastewater composition and spectra. Reference
   spectra for these components were taken from the literature and proved
   to correctly explain the sample spectra. A two-step deconvolution method
   was developed, which avoided negative nitrate coefficients while keeping
   deconvolution error low. The calibration file for DOC estimation was
   determined by analysing DOC and acquiring UV spectra from 48 samples.
   DOC values were correlated to UV spectra by multiple linear regression.
   Determination coefficient and standard error were comparable to the
   values found in the literature. In raw or diluted samples with an
   absorbance between 2.0 and 2.5, DOC was probably underestimated by the
   method. This points to some nonlinearity for absorbances above 2.0,
   rather than the 2.5 limit suggested by the original method.
   DOC calculation through UV deconvolution allowed for the estimation of
   DOC regime along the WWTP. Time bands for higher and lower DOC
   concentrations were determined and characterised at each sampling point,
   for weekdays and the weekend. Except for the plant effluent, clear time
   bands were found. In effluent, DOC was always low, and very small
   oscillations were detected, due to DOC removal and intense mixing in the
   biological process. DOC profiles at each point are discussed in this
   paper.
   The modified deconvolution method has proved to be an accurate and
   efficient technique for estimating DOC of a large number of raw and
   diluted samples. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a larger project to examine the causes of bulking in
   activated sludge plants treating wastewaters from paper mills, two
   laboratory-scale activated sludge plants were run in parallel. This was
   to evaluate the impact of variable environmental and operational
   parameters on the sludge ecology, and in particular, on the filamentous
   bacteria in the sludge. A survey of paper mills in the UK showed that
   there was a significant difference between the activated sludge plants
   at the paper mills using virgin fibre and those using recycled fibre. An
   examination of samples from activated sludge plants at the paper mills
   showed that there did not appear to be any significant correlation
   between filament abundance and the settlement characteristics as
   measured by stirred specific volume index (SSVI). The surface charge
   carried by the sludge particles was also measured and it was found that
   this parameter was better related to the SSVI Similar results were found
   for samples from the laboratory plants. Seven different sets of
   operational conditions were applied to the laboratory-scale plants.
   These were aimed at simulating the conditions noted for the full-scale
   plants during the mill survey. The effects of low dissolved oxygen and
   low organic loading rates were examined. The effect of inorganic sulphur
   compounds and volatile fatty acids was studied. A change in raw material
   from virgin fibre to recycled fibre (corrugated paper) caused an
   immediate and continuous deterioration in settlement. Divalent cations,
   calcium and magnesium, were found to be successful in controlling
   settlement in the final clarifier. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to evaluate the role of hydraulic
   retention time (HRT) and granular medium in faecal coliform (FC) and
   somatic coliphage (SC) removal in tertiary reed beds. Experiments were
   carried out in a pilot plant with four parallel reed beds (horizontal
   subsurface flow constructed wetlands), each one containing a different
   type of granular medium. This pilot plant is located in a wastewater
   treatment plant in Montcada i Reixac, near Barcelona, in northeastern
   Spain. The microbial inactivation ratios obtained in the different beds
   are compared as a function of three selected HRTs. Secondary effluent
   from the wastewater treatment plant was used as the influent of the
   pilot system. The microbial inactivation ratio ranged between 0.1 and
   2.7 log-units for FC and from 0.5 to 1.7 log-units for SC in beds with
   coarser granular material (5-25 mm), while it ranged between 0.7 and 3.4
   log-units for FC and from 0.9 to 2.6 log-units for SC in the bed with
   finer material (2-13 mm). HRT and granular medium are both key factors
   in microbial removal in the tertiary reed beds. The microbial
   inactivation ratio rises as the HRT increases until it reaches a
   saturation value (in general at an HRT of 3 days). The value of the
   microbial inactivation ratio at the saturation level depends on the
   granular medium contained in the bed. The specific surface area
   necessary to reach 2-3 log-units of FC and SC is approximately 3
   m(2)/person-equivalent. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chlorine is typically used within drinking water distribution systems to
   maintain a disinfectant residual and minimize biological regrowth.
   Typical distribution system models describe the loss of disinfectant due
   to reactions within the water matrix as first order with respect to
   chlorine concentration, with the reactants in excess. Recent work,
   however, has investigated relatively simple dynamic models that include
   a second, hypothetical reactive species. This work extends these latter
   models to account for discontinuities associated with rechlorination
   events, such as those caused by booster chlorination and by mixing at
   distribution system junction nodes. Mathematical arguments show that the
   reactive species model will always represent chlorine decay better than,
   or as well as, a first-order model, under single dose or rechlorination
   conditions; this result is confirmed by experiments on five different
   natural waters, and is further shown that the reactive species model can
   be significantly better under some rechlorination conditions.
   Trihalomethane (THM) formation was also monitored, and results show that
   a linear relationship between total THM (TTHM) formation and chlorine
   demand is appropriate under both single dose and rechlorination
   conditions. This linear relationship was estimated using the modeled
   chlorine demand from a calibrated reactive species model, and using the
   measured chlorine demand, both of which adequately represented the TTHM
   formation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation in urine-separating toilets (NoMix toilets) and waterless
   urinals causes severe maintenance problems and can strongly reduce the
   content of soluble phosphate. In this study, we present a computer model
   for estimating the precipitation potential (PP) in urine-collecting
   systems. Calculating the PP enables to predict the composition and mass
   concentration of precipitates. We used our computer model for
   investigating how urea hydrolysis and dilution with flushing water
   affect precipitation. In a previous study, we found that microbial urea
   hydrolysis (ureolysis) triggers precipitation and that the amount of
   precipitates is limited by calcium and magnesium. With the present
   simulations, we could confirm these findings. We determined that only a
   small fraction of urea has to be hydrolysed for reaching 95\% of the
   maximum PP. Since urease-positive bacteria are abundant in
   urine-collecting systems, strong precipitation is very likely. In
   further simulations, we determined that struvite (MgNH4PO4.6H(2)O) and
   hydroxyapatite (HAP, Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) are the main precipitate
   compounds. If urine is highly diluted with tapwater, calcite (CaCO3)
   occurs as well. HAP is the only calcium phosphate mineral, although
   several others were supersaturated. Additionally, the simulations
   indicated that urine dilution diminishes the risk of blockages, since
   the mass concentration of precipitates decreases with the volume of
   flushing water. Rainwater flushing is more effective than flushing with
   tapwater. Moreover, flushing with tapwater leads to high phosphate
   fixation, because the total amount of calcium and magnesium ions
   increases, while the total amount of phosphate keeps constant. Finally,
   we compared simulation results with field measurements and found good
   agreement at low and very high urine dilution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The two steps of nitrification, namely the oxidation of ammonia to
   nitrite and nitrite to nitrate, often need to be considered separately
   in process studies. For a detailed examination, it is desirable to
   monitor the two-step sequence using online measurements. In this paper,
   the use of online titrimetric and off-gas analysis (TOGA) methods for
   the examination of the process is presented. Using the known reaction
   stoichiometry, combination of the measured signals (rates of hydrogen
   ion production, oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide transfer) allows the
   determination of the three key process rates, namely the ammonia
   consumption rate, the nitrite accumulation rate and the nitrate
   production rate.
   Individual reaction rates determined with the TOGA sensor under a number
   of operation conditions are presented. The rates calculated directly
   from the measured signals are compared with those obtained from offline
   liquid sample analysis. Statistical analysis confirms that the results
   from the two approaches match well. This result could not have been
   guaranteed using alternative online methods.
   As a case study, the influences of pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) on
   nitrite accumulation are tested using the proposed method. It is shown
   that nitrite accumulation decreased with increasing DO and pH. Possible
   reasons for these observations are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{DEBtox model is a biologically based model used to analyse aquatic
   toxicity data (The analysis of aquatic toxicity data, VU University
   Press, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1996, 149pp.). To date, it has not
   been used to analyse sediment survival tests, mainly because this would
   require daily counting of survivors, which is difficult for benthic
   organisms. In the present study, we adapted survival toxicity tests with
   the midge Chironomus riparius to permit survival data analysis with
   DEBtox. To validate the adaptation proposed, we exposed organisms, to
   two chemicals, copper and methiocarb. We exposed larvae of second, third
   and fourth instar to different concentrations of the tested compounds
   and two different diets to assess the influence of diet and instar on
   DEBtox parameter estimates. Daily counting of organisms did not affect
   survival and did not lead to much more effort when compared to usual
   tests. Moreover, the analysis profited much from use of the DEBtox
   model. It was possible, with only survival data to estimate and validate
   the kinetics of the compounds, to predict survival during the recovery
   of exposed organisms and to assess the influence of food availability on
   toxicity. Food availability did not influence methiocarb toxicity, but
   copper was more toxic to food-limited organisms when a threshold
   concentration was exceeded. Comparison of parameters estimate also
   helped in understanding the differences in toxicity responses between
   instars. For the two compounds we studied, the difference was entirely
   explained by differences in threshold values. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{We conducted a comprehensive regional spatial assessment of bacterial
   water quality in order to determine the points of entry of fecal
   pollution into a swimming beach area on Lake Michigan that historically
   has had numerous water quality advisories for elevated levels of
   Escherichia coli (E coli). Intensive, consecutive-day water samples were
   collected during dry and rainy conditions across multiple shoreline and
   offshore sites, and E coli levels were enumerated from these samples.
   For both dry and rainy days, shoreline sites demonstrated significantly
   higher E coli levels than offshore regions.. We found that offshore
   (10-150m from shore) E coli levels did not exceed 235 CFU/100 ml in more
   than 5\% of the samples collected for 19 surveys (n = 209). In contrast,
   samples taken at the beach area exceeded 235 CFU/100 ml in 66\% of the
   samples collected for 43 shoreline surveys (n = 675). Locally high E
   coli levels coincided with bird presence and stormwater at the swimming
   beach located within the marina, and were unrelated to E coli levels in
   connecting harbor waters. We conclude that beach water quality may be
   impacted by local, persistent contamination, which may confound routine
   beach monitoring and prevent the detection of regional pollution from
   other sources. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is the heavy metal extraction by
   microemulsion, using regional vegetable oils as surfactants. Firstly,
   the main parameters, which have influence in the microemulsion region,
   such as: nature of cosurfactant, influence of cosurfactant
   (C)/surfactant (S) ratio and salinity were studied, with the objective
   of choosing the best extraction system. The extraction/reextraction
   process by microemulsion consists of two stages. In the first one, the
   heavy metal ion present in the aqueous phase is extracted by the
   microemulsion. In a second step, the reextraction process occurs: the
   microemulsion phase, rich in metal, is acidified and the metal is
   recovered in a new aqueous phase, with higher concentration. The used
   system had the following parameters: surfactant-saponified coconut oil;
   cosurfactant-n-butanol; oil phase-kerosene; C/S ratio=4; salinity-2\%
   (NaCl); temperature of 27+/-1degreesC; water phase-aqueous solution that
   varied according to the heavy metal in study (Cr; Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and
   Pb). A methodology of experimental planning was used (Scheffe Net) to
   study the behavior of the extraction in a chosen domain. The extraction
   was accomplished in one step and yielded extraction percentage higher
   than 98\% for all metals. In the reextraction HCl-8M was used as
   reextraction agent and the influence of the pH and time were verified.
   This work showed the great efficiency of the microemulsion, indicating
   that it is possible to extract selectively the heavy metals from the
   aqueous phase. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Coloured substances are often assumed to behave differently in the algal
   growth inhibition test due to shading of the algae. We have investigated
   EU-notifications of new substances and found no significant differences
   in algal test results between colours and non-colours. A modified method
   to differentiate between shading and toxicity is not satisfactory,
   because the method used to determine the shading effect is incorrect.
   Due to the shaking of the test flasks in the algal test intermittent
   light conditions are achieved which lead to a higher growth rate than
   expected from proposed tests with constant reduced light conditions.
   This will result in overestimation of the shading effect and thus to
   underestimation of chemical toxicity. Furthermore, we showed in
   experiments with the reference substance potassium dichromate that
   reduced light can reduce the measurable toxicity of chemicals.
   Comparing our results with approaches proposed in the literature, a
   simple approach to reduce effects of undesired shading when testing
   coloured substances is to achieve light saturation for the algae by
   increasing illumination at least to the upper limit given in test
   guidelines (120 muE s(-1) m(-2)) and, optionally, to reduce the light
   path by choosing smaller test volumes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{A preliminary investigation is described on the application of
   calorimetry as a sensitive technique to evaluate nitrifying activity in

   dissipation due to biological nitrification reactions (ammonia or

   calorimetric data and the main process variables, i.e. ammonia and
   nitrite concentration and oxygen uptake, have been verified, and confirm
   the potential of calorimetry to investigate, monitor and control even
   weakly exothermic biological processes like autotrophic nitrification.
   Heat yields (Y-Q/i) for ammonia, nitrite, and oxygen, defined as the
   heat released per unit amount of converted reactant, have been
   separately evaluated. Moreover, calorimetric experiments on activated
   sludge from a full-scale nitrogen removal wastewater treatment plant
   have been carried out and kinetic parameters for both ammonia and

Abstract = {{Fluorescence measurement of intracellular nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide (NADH) provides information about the physiological
   response of microbes towards changing conditions in their environment
   and has been suggested to be useful for the control of wastewater
   treatment plants. In this study, the practical usefulness of such
   measurements was evaluated from batch experiments with a commercially
   available NADH sensor in a bench scale reactor. The sensor was linear in
   the NADH concentration, robust, almost maintenance free, and hardly
   sensitive to floc size distribution. Measured fluorescence intensity
   proved to depend strongly on the concentration of active heterotrophic
   biomass. The NADH level was supposed to be dependent on the ratio of
   electron donor/electron acceptor availability inside the cells; however,
   neither acetate nor ammonium addition was reflected by the measurement
   signal.
   A jump wise NADH signal change was observed at complete oxygen or
   nitrate depletion as also reflected by bends in the redox curve. In the
   near zero concentration ranges of oxygen and nitrate (0.1-0.5 mg/l) the
   signal changes only slightly in the opposite direction to the redox
   trend. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fractal dimensions of particle populations of cohesive sediment were
   examined during deposition experiments in an annular flume at four
   conditions of steady-state flow (0.058, 0.123, 0.212 and 0.323 Pa).
   Light microscopy and an image analysis system were used to determine
   area, longest axis and perimeter of suspended solids. Four fractal
   dimensions (D, D-1, D-2, D-k) were calculated from the slopes of
   regression lines of the relevant variables on double log plots. The
   fractal dimension D, which relates the projected area (A) to the
   perimeter (P) of the particle (P proportional to A(D/2)), increased from
   1.25+/-0.005 at a shear stress of 0.058 Pa to a maximum of 1.36+/-0.003
   at 0.121 Pa then decreased to 1.34+/-0.001 at 0.323 Pa. The change in D
   indicated that particle boundaries became more convoluted and the shape
   of larger particles was more irregular at higher levels of shear stress.
   At the highest shear stress, the observed decrease in D resulted from
   floc breakage due to increased particle collisions. The fractal
   dimension D, which relates the longest axis (A) to the perimeter (P) of
   the particle (P proportional to A(D/2)), increased from 1.00+/-0.006 at
   a shear stress of 0.058 Pa to a maximum of 1.25+/-0.003 at 0.325Pa. The
   fractal dimension D-2, which relates the longest axis with the projected
   area of the particle (A proportional to l(D2)), increased from
   1.35+/-0.014 at a shear stress of 0.058 Pa to a maximum of 1.81+/-0.005
   at 0.323Pa. The observed increases in D-1 and D-2 indicate that
   particles became more elongated with increasing shear stress. Values of
   the fractal dimension D-k, resulting from the Korcak's empirical law for
   particle population, decreased from 3.68+/-0.002 at a shear stress of
   0.058 Pa to 1.33+/-0.001 at 0.323 Pa and indicate that the particle size
   distribution changed from a population of similar sized particles at low
   shear to larger flocculated particles at higher levels of shear. The
   results show that small particle clusters (micro-flocs) are the
   formational units of larger flocs in the water column and the stability
   of larger flocs is a function of the shear stress at steady state. (C)

Abstract = {{Three different industrial wastewaters from the production of
   stilbene-based fluorescent whitening agents were investigated with
   regard to the applicability of advanced oxidation processes combined
   with biodegradation. Oxidation processes included the application of
   ozone, hydrogen peroxide, UV-radiation and Fenton's reagent (Fe2+/H2O2).
   Characterization of the combined chemical-biological treatment was done
   by sum parameters and HPLC analysis. In addition, toxicity was
   determined using the luminescence inhibition test. Results showed that
   processes producing OH-radicals without the need of UV-irradiation
   proved to be suited for the oxidation of all three wastewaters. H2O2/UV
   processes were ineffective due to the high inner filter effect of the
   effluents. Comparing the combined oxidative-biological process with
   biological treatment, the applied pre-oxidation steps did not always
   lead to a significant improvement of the biological degradation. In one
   case, an inverted treatment starting with biodegradation followed by
   oxidation turned out to be the preferable procedure. After oxidation
   with ozone or ozone combined with UV-irradiation, an increase in
   toxicity was partly observed indicating the formation of toxic
   intermediate products. In some cases samples had to be diluted before
   the biodegradation step to achieve a better biodegradability. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Bacterial strains 1CX and SAD4i-previously isolated from the mixed
   liquor of a municipal sewage treatment plant-are capable of degrading
   the azo dye Acid Orange 7 (AO7) and sulfanilic acid, respectively. A
   rotating drum bioreactor (RDBR), operating under continuous flow and
   nutrient conditions designed to simulate the effluent from a dye
   manufacturing plant, was seeded with strains 1CX and SAD4i, forming a
   biofilm capable of degrading AO7 and sulfanilic acid. In addition, an
   RDBR containing a pre-existing biofilm capable of degrading AO7, but not
   sulfanilic acid, was seeded with strain SAD4i alone. Strain SAD4i was
   incorporated into the existing biofilm and degraded the sulfanilic acid
   resulting from the degradation of AO7 by indigenous members of the
   biofilm. The ability to seed a bioreactor with bacterial strains capable
   of degrading azo dyes, and resulting by-products, in a mixed microbial
   community suggests that this process could have commercial applications.

Abstract = {{A pure culture of Amaricoccus kaplicensis was aerobically cultured at a
   long culture residence time (Theta(C) > 12 d), under periodic acetate
   feeding in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR). The cycle length and,
   correspondingly, the volumetric organic load rate (vOLR) were varied in
   the range 4-24h and 0.76-0.12 g COD l(-1)d(-1), respectively. The
   transient response of the microorganism to the acetate spike was
   investigated throughout batch tests, as a function of SBR cycle length
   and vOLR. In all tested conditions, a rapid transient response was
   observed, mainly due to acetate storage in the form of
   polyhydroxybutyrate, since growth (production of active biomass) played
   a minor role. Apart from this general trend, the maximum rates under
   transient conditions increased as the cycle length increased from 4 to
   24 h. In the SBR, the longest cycle also caused a decrease in floc size
   and settleability as well as an increase in the observed yield. The
   observed effect of SBR operating conditions on the physiological state
   of cells and their related transient response may have great
   significance on the performance of full scale activated sludge
   processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite, has been implicated in a
   number of waterborne disease outbreaks and is difficult to inactivate
   using free chlorine. It appears, however, to be inactivated more easily
   by other oxidants such as chlorine dioxide or ozone. A major element of
   the EPA (US EPA) strategy for controlling C parvum (oocysts) in drinking
   water is the possible use of Ct (concentration of disinfectant in mg/L
   times time in minutes) values. To support this strategy a Ct equation,
   based on first-order kinetics, is proposed to provide guidance to
   drinking water utilities for the application of chlorine dioxide for
   controlling C parvum oocysts. The equation is based on standard
   statistical techniques using available bench scale data. It can predict
   mean inactivation levels as well as a statistically conservative upper
   bound Ct value. This upper bound could be used to insure an appropriate
   safety factor for the protection of public health. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microbial activity of the sediment phase in a 1.5-km-long concrete sewer
   section with a cement pipe in a 540-mm diameter was investigated in this
   paper. SEM examinations and elementary composition analyses of the
   sediment samples have identified the presence of a biofilm layer at the
   sediment surface. Bacterial counting results with a DNA-staining
   technique have revealed that the amount of bacteria in this layer was
   2.1 x 10(11) cell g(-1) dry wt, which is close to that of activated
   sludge. ATP content in the sewer biofilm was found relatively high,
   demonstrating that the sewer biofilm is active. Throughout the entire
   1.5-km sewer section, the biofilm activity was maintained at almost the
   same level. Lab-scale sediment oxygen uptake flux (SOUF) tests showed
   that the shear flow velocity above the sediment phase linearly increases
   the SOUF, which of the potential value was determined to be 32 g O-2
   m(-2) day(-1) at an estimated shear flow velocity of 0.055 m s(-1) at
   25degreesC in the sewer line, provided that the mean flow velocity was
   1.5 m s(-1), and the mean water depth was 220 mm. Such a high SOUF value
   further endorsed the existence of the active sewer biofilm. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Waste biosolids collected from sewage works is a biomass containing a
   vast amount of polysaccharides and proteins, and thus is considered a

   This work demonstrated, contrary to the common assumption, that the

   anaerobes; it in fact prohibits effective bio-hydrogen production. Using
   filtrate after removal of solids from biosolids produces more hydrogen
   than using the whole biosolids, with the former reaching a level an

Abstract = {{The use of herbicides constitutes the principal method of weed control
   but the introduction of these compounds into the aquatic environment
   (primarily through runoff) may have severe consequences for non-target
   plants. In this study, we describe a sensitive and inexpensive method
   for detection of photosynthesis-inhibiting herbicides, based on
   chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence emission. Algae exhibited a Chl
   fluorescence signature with two maxima around 684 and 735 nm, correlated
   with the total Chl content of the algal suspension. The ratio of these
   two maxima (i.e. F684/F735) can be used as an indicator of stress in the
   photosynthetic apparatus, and thus represents a very simple method for
   in vivo evaluation of the health status of algae. Determination of the
   F684/F735 fluorescence ratio revealed the presence and phytotoxicity of
   atrazine, metribuzin, terbuthylazine, diuron, DCPMU, DCPU and paraquat.
   The toxic effect of these pollutants was estimated by monitoring the
   increase in the F684/F735 value, which reflects photosystem II and
   photosystem I photochemistry. We observed a drastic increase in the
   magnitude of this ratio, correlating quantitatively with herbicide
   concentration and corresponding to a decline in algal photosynthetic
   activity. For the tested herbicides affecting photosynthetic electron
   transport, the magnitude of the effect was as follows: diuron = DCPMU >
   metribuzin > atrazine > terbuthylazine > paraquat > DCPU. The F684/17735
   Chl fluorescence ratio thus gives toxicity responses which compare
   favourably with tests such as the algal growth inhibition test, and
   could therefore be used to detect the presence and phytotoxicity of
   herbicides in aquatic environments. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cases of low stress can frequently occur in a wastewater treatment plant
   (WWTP). As they have no visible impact on the plant operation, they
   generally go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it would appear that an
   accumulation of such cases can result in serious operational problems.
   The impact of the repeated application of oxygen deficiency on the
   proliferation of the filamentous bacteria Sphaerotilus natans,
   Haliscomenobacter hydrossis, Eikelboom type 021N and Thiothrix spp has
   been studied on WWTP pilots. Two different oxygen deficiencies series
   were tested. Filamentous bacteria evolution in activated sludge was
   monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridization. For the weak
   deficiencies, no significant variation in the filamentous bacteria
   response level was recorded, whereas with more severe deficiencies the
   filamentous bacteria response increased considerably with the increase
   in stress number. From the results obtained, it would appear that there
   is an intensity and frequency threshold beyond which the filamentous
   bacteria response levels increase when the stress is applied in series.
   This ``oxygen deficiencies repetition{''} appears to be an important
   factor in the appearance of bulking. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Determinations of perchlorate anion (ClO4-) transport and rejection were
   performed using a surfactant modified ultrafiltration (UF) membrane.
   Perchlorate anion (at a concentration of 100 mug/L of ClO4-, spiked with
   KClO4) was introduced to the membrane as a pure component, in binary
   mixtures with other salts, cationic and anionic surfactants, and at
   various ionic strength conditions (conductivity). Also, a natural source
   water was spiked with perchlorate in the presence of cationic and
   anionic surfactants and used to determine the effects of a complex
   mixture (including natural organic matter (NOM)) on the observed
   rejection. All filtration measurements were performed at approximately
   the same permeate flow rate in order to minimize artifacts from mass
   transfer at the membrane interface. The objective of this study was to
   modify a negatively charged UF membrane in terms of the fundamental
   mechanisms, steric/size exclusion and electrostatic exclusion and to
   enhance perchlorate rejection, with synthetic water and a blend of
   Colorado River water and State Project water (CRW/SPW). Previous work
   suggested that perchlorate was dominantly rejected by electrostatic
   exclusion for charged nanofiltration (NF) and UF membranes (Rejection of
   perchlorate by reverse osmosis, nanofiltration and ultrafiltration (UF)
   membranes: mechanism and modeling. Ph.D. dissertation, University of
   Colorado, Boulder, USA, 2001). In that research, perchlorate rejection
   capability was quickly lost in the presence of a sufficient amount of
   other ions. However, this study showed that ClO4- was excluded from a
   (negatively) charged UF membrane with pores large with respect to the
   size of the ion. Although perchlorate rejection capability due to
   apparent electrostatic force was reduced in the presence of a cationic
   surfactant, a desired amount of the ClO4- was excluded by steric
   exclusion. The steric exclusion was due to decreasing membrane pore size
   caused by the adsorption of the cationic surfactant. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In industry and in tourist areas, periods exist during which no or only
   very little sewage is produced, and the wastewater treatment facilities
   have to be set into an idle phase over several days and even weeks. When
   wastewater is generated again and delivered to the treatment plant, the
   microorganisms in the activated sludge plant may have lost activity, and
   the activated sludge floes may have disintegrated. From previous
   observation, it is assumed that granular activated sludge is more
   resistant against long-term storage than activated sludge flocs.
   Experiments using a laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) were
   conducted to study the impacts of a 7-weeks anaerobic idle time on
   structural integrity and metabolic activity of granular activated
   sludge, and the time required to regain the former operational, status
   of the plant., Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was used as an indicator to
   evaluate the metabolic activity of the sludge. The results revealed that
   the size, color and sedimentation characteristics of the granular sludge
   did hardly change during the storage period. Sludge activity, however,
   dropped to values as low as 0.17 mg min(-1) L-1. After restarting the
   reactor, the OCR increased within I day to a level of 0.57 mg min(-1)
   L-1, kept rising at a linear rate in the following days, and reached
   after I week, a value of 5.74 mg min(-1) L-1 typical for the former
   activity status. These results imply that granular activated sludge c an
   be stored for a considerably long period of time, and brought into
   service again relatively quickly. After an idle period of 7 weeks, it
   took less than a week to regain full capacity of the SBR. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Clarification of municipal wastewater was shown to be improved
   significantly by the addition of cultured bdelloid rotifers. The rate
   and degree of suspended particle removal were correlated with rotifer
   number. The size range of unsettled particles suspended in wastewater
   was determined and found to overlap with the size range of particles
   consumed by rotifers. Rotifers were shown to have two distinct effects
   on suspended particles: consumption of biomass due to feeding activity;
   and improved settling, probably due to enhanced aggregation. These
   experiments demonstrate the potential for the use of bdelloid rotifers
   in an enhanced wastewater treatment process, with reduced biomass
   production and improved effluent clarity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Lagoon systems are a common and effective method to purify communal
   sewage in rural areas. Low costs and high purification rates are some of
   their advantages. But mostly algae blooms in the lagoon cause a
   secondary pollution of the following stream. In order to tackle this
   problem, several tests have been carried out combining both lagoon and
   filtering system. This paper describes a 3 year study on the combination
   of a lagoon and a planted filter dam in one basin. This system has shown
   a high and continuous retention rate of algae, pH buffering and a
   further reduction of general sewage parameters. Furthermore, the effects
   of varying weather conditions (dry, wet) and seasonal aspects on this
   combined system will be presented. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All.

Abstract = {{In this study we present a new approach to determine volumes,
   heterogeneity factors, and compositions of the bacterial population of
   activated sludge floes by 3D confocal imaging. After staining the fresh
   floes with fluorescein-isothiocyanate, 75 stacks of images (containing
   approx. 3000 floes) were acquired with a confocal laser scanning
   microscope. The self-developed macro 3D volume and surface determination
   for the KS 400 software package combined the images of one stack to a 3D
   image and calculated the real floe volume and surface. We determined
   heterogeneity factors like the ratio of real floc surface to the surface
   of a sphere with the respective volume and the fractal dimension (D-f).
   According to their significant influence on floe integrity and quality,
   we also investigated the chemical composition of floes and quantified
   their bacterial population structure by using group-specific
   rRNA-targeted probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization. By a
   settling experiment we enriched floes with poor settling properties and
   determined the above-mentioned parameters. This approach revealed shifts
   in floc volume, heterogeneity, and bacterial and chemical composition
   according to the settling quality of the floes. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A series of chemostat studies were conducted at a constant influent
   total organic carbon of 3750 mg/L (equivalent chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) of 10,000mg/L) but at different influent sulfates of 1000, 3000
   and 5000 mg/L in order to investigate the feasibility of online sulfide
   toxicity control through periodic oxygenation to the recycled biogas
   stream. The oxygen dosing for sulfide oxidation was regulated by using
   oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as a controlling parameter. During
   oxygenation at elevated ORPs of -230 and -180mV (50 and 100mV above
   natural ORP of -280mV, respectively), the dissolved and gaseous sulfides
   were completely eliminated which resulted in a concomitant improvement
   in methane yield by 56.3\% at 5000mg/L influent sulfate. However, at
   influent sulfates of 1000 and 3000 mg/L, both methane generation rate
   and sulfate removal efficiency were dropped appreciably at elevated
   ORPs. Facultative heterotrophs were found to consume as high as 66.3\%
   of the influent COD during oxygenation. For effective sulfide oxidation
   at lower sulfate levels, it was no longer required to raise the ORP by
   as much as 50 or 100 mV. The actual needed ORP increase depended on the
   influent sulfate. This study had proven that the ORP-controlled
   oxygenation was reliable for achieving consistent online sulfide control
   during anaerobic treatment of high-sulfate wastewater. (C) 2003 Elsevier

   processed in duplicate) and in terms of accuracy (the percentage of eggs
   recovered from a sample to which eggs were added at the beginning of the
   extraction procedure), This form of quality analysis/control is
   typically called the ``Split/Spike{''} method. This method of biosolid
   processing for helminth egg recovery had an overall accuracy of about
   60\% or greater and a percent variation from the mean density (an
   indirect method of assessing precision) of only 3-35\%. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{An enclosure experiment in the shallow, subtropical Lake Donghu, China,
   was performed in the summer of 2001 to examine the effect of TN:TP
   (total phosphorus) ratios and P-reduction on the occurrence of
   Microcysitis blooms. The treatments were performed with enough amounts
   of N but with different amounts of P in the water column and sediment.
   Microcystis blooms occurred in the enclosures either with an initial
   TN:TP <29 or TN:TP >29 where the nutrients (N, P) were high enough.
   Microcysitis blooms never occurred in the treatments with low P
   concentration in spite of the presence of sufficient N. The P-rich
   sediments served as an important source for the P supply in the water
   column, and such a process was activated greatly by the outburst of
   Microcystis blooms which pumped up selectively P from the sediments and
   thus decreased the TN:TP ratios. Therefore, the low TN:TP ratio is not a
   cause but rather a result of Microcystis blooms. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A sorbent (Organosorb) is used in the wastewater purification from
   organic contaminants, here simulated by tetradecane. A short
   hydrodynamic treatment in a rather intense hydrodynamic field (G >
   10(3)) (called ultraflocculation) is applied to the sorbent suspension
   to which a flocculant is added. The efficiency of removal of the sorbent
   is studied. The sorbent concentration, the flocculant concentration, the
   treatment time, the organic pollutant (which has to be sorbed by the
   sorbent), the detergent (used for the emulsification of the pollutant),
   the pH and the calcium concentration of the water all influence the
   flocculation efficiency (E) of the sorbent particles. For each set of
   these parameters there exists an optimum intensity of the hydrodynamic
   treatment at which maximum flocculation efficiency is reached. An
   increase in the optimum intensity of the hydrodynamic field corresponds
   to an increased floc break-up, and consequently a lower maximum

Abstract = {{Chlorination is the most economical, non-specific method to control the
   excessive growth of filamentous microorganisms causing bulking in
   activated sludge systems in the treatment of food industrial
   wastewaters; it was one of the first methods used to control filamentous
   bulking and is still widely employed. Considering that chlorination
   affects both floc-forming and filamentous micro-organisms and leaves
   undesirable disinfection by-products, it is necessary to define the
   adequate doses to control bulking, minimizing the effect on floc-forming
   bacteria.
   In the present work the effect of biomass concentration and type of
   micro-organism on chlorine decay kinetics was evaluated; the
   inactivation of either a filamentous (Sphaerotilus natans) or a
   floc-forming (Acinetobacter anitratus) micro-organism due to
   chlorination was also analyzed.
   For chlorine decay assays, the samples were treated in a batch system
   with sodium hypochlorite ranging between 9.8 and 56.6mg Cl-2 (gVSS)(-1).
   Respirometric assays were used to evaluate the effect of chlorine on
   micro-organisms respiratory activity; in these cases, sodium
   hypochlorite doses ranged between 2.5 and 18 MgCl2 (gVSS)(-1).
   A model that allowed. to predict simultaneously chlorine consumption and
   respiratory activity decay for both microorganisms as a function of time
   was proposed. The model includes three coupled differential equations
   corresponding to respiratory inhibition, readily organic matter
   oxidation by chlorine and chlorine decay. The rate of chlorine decay
   depended on both, type and concentration of the micro-organisms. in the
   system. Chlorine consumption rate due to S. natans was 2-4 times faster
   than A. anitratus. Using the proposed model initial critical chlorine
   doses (the lowest initial dose that leads to a total inhibition of the
   respiratory activity) were calculated for both micro-organisms and
   values of 11.9 MgCl2 (gVSS)(-1) for S. natans and 4.5 MgCl2 (gVSS)(-1)
   for A. anitratus were obtained. These critical doses indicated that in
   non flocculated pure cultures, floc-former bacteria A. anitratus was
   more susceptible to chlorine action than S. natans. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The coagulation-anaerobic acidification-aeration package reactor was
   designed for the treatment of pulp CEH bleaching effluents, the
   efficiencies in CODcr, BOD5, AOX and toxicity removal achieved were
   88.1\%, 81.0\%, 98.4\% and 92.0\%, respectively, with 15h HRT. The
   toxicity and AOX were removed mainly through coagulation and anaerobic
   process, while the COD and BOD5 were removed mainly through coagulation
   and aerobic process. The pretreatment of coagulation precipitation
   decreased the following organic load, which decreased the following
   treatment retention time and increased the stability of the system.
   The results of GC-MS showed: pollutants of wastewater were mainly
   chlorinated organics, most of AOX and the toxicity were removed by
   reductive dechlorination and acidified hydrolysis in anaerobic unit, the
   high COD removal in aerobic unit showed further degradation of
   pollutants. Chlorine atoms in the ortho position were preferentially
   dechlorination, that in para position were difficult to remove from
   chlorinated phenols during biological treatment. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Electron beam irradiation of aqueous solutions containing different lead
   compounds (Pb2+, (CH3)(3)Pb+, (C2H5)(3)Pb+) was carried out. Formate and

   precipitation of Pb2+, only observed in the presence of formate, Was
   Attributed to COO.- but the nature of the precipitate is still unclear.
   Organolead compounds were shown to be efficiently degraded, probably
   converted into Pb2+, using doses around 4 kGy. In the absence of
   scavengers, the degradation occurred according to the alkyl group
   stability. Both trialkyllead compounds were shown to be degraded by HO..
   On the contrary, the contribution of hydrogen atoms (H-.) was shown to
   be highly dependent on the nature of the alkyl group, i.e. negligible

Abstract = {{The Ni2+ accumulation in batch mode from diluted solutions by gel beads

   pH of the Ni2+ solution was not critical for Ni2+ accumulation.
   Accumulation of metals Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Cd2+ and Zn2+ by GG gel
   beads reached the equilibrium after 24h. The removal of Pb2+ and Cu2+
   from the aqueous solution was very efficient, with maximum metal uptake
   (q(max)) of 0.85 and 0.75 mmol/g dw GG, respectively. The general q(max)
   sequence was Ph > Cu > Ni approximate to Zn = Co > Cd. In an equimolar

Abstract = {{This paper examines the influence of the chemical constituents of
   activated sludge and extracted extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   on the surface properties, hydrophobicity, surface charge (SC) and
   flocculating ability (FA) of activated sludge floes. Activated sludge
   samples from 7 different full-scale wastewater treatment plants were
   examined. Protein and humic substances were found to be the dominant
   polymeric compounds in the activated sludges and the extracted EPS, and
   they significantly affected the FA and surface properties,
   hydrophobicity and SC, of the sludge floes. The polymeric compounds
   proteins, humic substances and carbohydrates in the sludge floes and the
   extracted EPS contributed to the negative SC, but correlated negatively
   to the hydrophobicity of sludge floes. The quantity of protein and
   carbohydrate within the sludge and the extracted EPS was correlated
   positively to the FA of the sludge floes, while increased amounts of
   humic substances resulted in lower FA. In contrast, increased amounts of
   total extracted EPS had a negative correlation to FA. The results reveal
   that the quality and quantity of the polymeric compounds within the
   sludge floes is more informative, with respect to understanding the
   mechanisms involved in flocculation, than if only the extracted EPS are
   considered. This is an important finding as it indicates that extracting
   EPS may be insufficient to characterise the EPS. This is due to the low
   extraction efficiency and difficulties involved in the separation of EPS
   from other organic compounds. Correlations were observed between the
   surface properties and FA of the sludge floes., This confirms that the
   surface properties of the, sludge flocs play an important role in the
   bioflocculation process but that also other interactions like polymer
   entanglement are important. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), addition on various operating
   parameters of activated sludge process was evaluated. To accomplish
   this, two parallel lab-scale continuous-flow activated sludge plants
   were operated. One was used as a control plant, while the other received
   Cr(VI) concentrations equal to 0.5, 1, 3 and 5mg1(-1). Cr(VI)
   concentrations of 0.5 mg 1(-1) caused significant inhibition of the
   nitrification process (up to 74\% decrease in ammonia removal
   efficiency). On the contrary, the effect of Cr(VI) on organic substrate
   removal was minor for concentrations up to 5mg1(-1), indicating that
   heterotrophic microorganisms are less sensitive to Cr(VI) than
   nitrifiers. Activated sludge floc size and structure characterization
   showed that Cr(VI) concentrations higher than 1 mg 1(-1) reduced the
   filaments abundance, causing the appearance of pin-point flocs and
   free-dispersed bacteria. Additionally, the variability of protozoa and
   rotifers was reduced. As a result of disperse growth, effluent quality
   deteriorated, since significant amounts of suspended solids escaped with
   the effluent. Termination of Cr(VI) addition led to a partial recovery
   of the nitrification process (up to 57\% recovery). Similar recovery
   signs were not observed for activated sludge floc size and structure.
   Finally, shock loading to the control plant with 5 mg 1(-1) Cr(VI) for 2
   days resulted in a significant inhibition of the nitrification process
   and a reduction in filamentous microorganisms abundance. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Black River, OH, is contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs) from coke ovens of a US Steel Corp. Plant. Closing of a coking
   plant in 1983 and environmental dredging of the sediments during 1989
   and 1990 has reduced the PAH levels significantly. This study quantifies
   the decrease, and consider source apportionment of PAHs in Black River
   sediments using chemical mass balance modeling. Five vibra cores
   collected in 1998 and dated using Pb-210 and (CS)-C-137, were analyzed
   for 18 PAHs. The cores had total PAH concentrations between 250 and
   0.10ppm. PAH maxima occur in 1949, 1969, in accordance with regional
   historical inputs (core BR4), and in 1991 due to remediation (BR6). Coke
   oven emissions (CO), highway dust (HWY), and wood burning (WB) are
   likely sources. The CO source (6-92\% of total PAHs) is maximal in 1954,
   and again in 1992-1994 due to the exposure and redistribution of older
   contaminated sediments during dredging, and decreases thereafter. There
   is minimal CO content in 1985 (BR4), 2 yr after closure of the coking
   plant. The HWY contribution (2-86\%) is high during 1969-1988, and
   increases again after 1993. The WB source is less than 23\%, and
   exhibits a minimum (2\%) around 1979 (BR4). There is evidence of aerobic
   biodegradation or photolysis in the sediment of phenanthrene (PhA) at
   PhA concentrations > 500 ppb. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This investigation introduces the application of a relatively rapid
   technique to obtain information about the dynamic nature of microbial
   communities in activated sludge. The objective has been to consider
   variability due to measurement errors and protocol changes within the
   same quantitative framework as the analysis of systematic differences in
   microbial communities in large-scale aerobic activated sludge secondary
   wastewater treatment systems. Adjustments to the methodology were
   considered due to their potential for simplifying and shortening the
   analysis procedure. All modifications to the protocols used to assay the
   composition of microbial fatty acids (MFAs) of activated sludge imposed
   some bias to the chromatographic data. This methodological bias was
   similar in magnitude to the level of discrimination between activated
   sludge microbial community structures that were considered as part of
   the present study. NIFA analysis supported the expectations of subtle
   but systematic community structure differences and shifts in activated
   sludge based on the current understanding of these wastewater treatment
   systems. A standardized NIFA methodology was shown to be sensitive to
   minor systematic changes in activated sludge communities due the
   anticipated underlying factors of selective pressures from the process
   configuration, history, operational conditions and/or nutrient status.
   The chemometric approach of fatty acid isopropyl ester analysis of
   activated sludge can provide a routine tool for meaningful and
   quantitative information of changes in activated sludge quality in
   full-scale treatment systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Copper, zinc, cadmium and selenium were measured in the gastropod
   mollusc Bembicium nanum at two uncontaminated locations, Jervis Bay and
   Rosedale, NSW, to determine natural variability of metals associated
   with gender, mass, shore position and temporal variability. Trace metals
   were also measured in B. nanum at three industrialised locations to
   determine the accumulation of trace metals in contaminated environments.
   Copper, zinc, cadmium and selenium concentrations were not significantly
   different between mate and female B. nanum. No significant relationships
   were found between zinc, cadmium and selenium concentrations and mass.
   There was a significant relationship between copper concentration and
   mass but only 19\% of the variation was explained by mass. Generally
   inherent variability within samples had a greater influence than gender
   or variations in mass on trace metal concentrations.
   No trend was found in cadmium and selenium concentrations with variation
   in shoreline position. Copper and zinc concentrations increased further
   away from the low tide mark, with a decrease in metal concentrations at
   the furthest site from the water. Variability in metal concentrations is
   attributable to variations in food source, food availability and
   different immersion times.
   Copper, zinc, cadmium and selenium concentrations varied over a 12-month
   period. Copper, cadmium and selenium were taken up and lost over time,
   as metal body burden followed the same trend as metal concentrations.
   Zinc concentrations were influenced by mass. Copper and cadmium
   concentrations fluctuated throughout the 12-month period but with no
   clear seasonal trends. Selenium concentrations peaked in spring
   (October), with concentrations remaining uniform over the other months.
   These differences in mean concentrations between months were most likely
   due to inherent trace metal variability associated with differences in
   food availability and changes in metabolic rates associated with-changes
   in temperature during the study period. Measurement of trace metals in
   B. nanum at contaminated sites showed that B. nanum accumulates metals
   in response to contamination.
   B. nanum meets most of the requirements to be a biomonitor of trace
   metal contamination as they are abundant, sedentary, easy to identify,
   provide sufficient tissue for analysis, tolerate high concentrations of
   pollutants and they accumulate trace metals in response to
   contamination. However, as trace metal concentration can vary with mass,
   shoreline position and temporally, care must be taken to collect
   individual organisms with similar mass from similar shoreline positions
   and times. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a field study on the efficiency of dune recharge for drinking water
   production, bacteriophage MS2 was shown to be removed 8 log(10) by
   passage through the dune sand. The question of whether pathogenic
   viruses would be removed as much as MS2 was studied by comparing
   complete breakthrough curves of MS2 with those of the human viruses
   Coxsackievirus 134 (CB4) and Poliovirus 1 (PV 1) in laboratory columns.
   The columns were designed to closely simulate the field conditions: same
   sand, water, porewater velocity and temperature. Employing a two-site
   kinetic model to simulate breakthrough curves, attachment/detachment to
   two types of kinetic sites as well as inactivation of free and attached
   viruses were evaluated. It was found that attachment to only one of the
   sites is of significance for determining overall removal. At field
   scale, removal of the less negatively charged PV I was extrapolated to
   be about 30 times greater than that of MS2, but removal of CB4 would be
   only as much as that of MS2. Also, removal of spores of Clostridium
   perfringens D10, a potential surrogate for Cryptosporidium oocysts, was
   studied. The attachment rate coefficient of the spores was 7.5 times
   greater than that of MS2. However, this does not imply that the removal
   of the spores is 7.5 times greater than that of MS2. Due to negligible
   inactivation in combination with detachment of previously attached
   spores, the actual removal rate of the spores depends on the duration of
   contamination and eventually all spores will break through. Provided no
   irreversible attachment or physical straining occurs, this may also be
   the case for other persistent microorganisms, like oocysts of
   Cryptosporidium. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   operated for more than 18 months. These microorganisms contained
   polyphosphate granules and glycogen inclusions, which suggests that they
   are a type of phosphorus-accumulating organism. Quinones, slot
   hybridization, and 16S rRNA sequencing analyses showed that the members
   of the Proteobacteria beta subclass were the most abundant species and
   were affiliated with the Rhodocyclus-like group. Phylogenetic analysis
   revealed that the two dominating clones of the beta subclass were
   closely related to the Rhodocyclus-like group. It was concluded that the
   coccus-shaped organisms related to the Rhodocyclus-like group within the
   Proteobacteria beta subclass were the most dominant species believed
   responsible for biological phosphorus removal in SBR operation with
   acetate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three rotating disk biofilm reactors were operated to evaluate whether
   bioaugmentation and biostimulation can be used to improve the start-up
   of microbial nitrification. The first reactor was bioaugmented during
   start-up period with an enrichment culture of nitrifying bacteria, the
   second reactor received a synthetic medium containing NH4+ and NO2- to
   facilitate concomitant proliferation of ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing
   bacteria, and the third reactor was used as a control. To evaluate the
   effectiveness of bioaugmentation and biostimulation approaches,
   time-dependent developments of nitrifying bacterial community and in
   situ nitrifying activity in biofilms were monitored by fluorescence in
   situ hybridization (FISH) technique and microelectrode measurements of
   NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, and O-2. In situ hybridization results revealed that
   addition of the enrichment culture of nitrifying bacteria significantly
   facilitated development of dense nitrifying bacterial populations in the
   biofilm shortly after, which led to a rapid start-up and enhancement of
   in situ nitrification activity. The inoculated bacteria could
   proliferate and/or survive in the biofilm. In addition, the addition of
   nitrifying bacteria increased the abundance of nitrifying bacteria in
   the surface of the biofilm, resulting in the higher nitrification rate.
   On the other hand, the addition of 2.1 mM NO2- did not stimulate the
   growth of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and did inhibit the proliferation
   of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria instead. Thus, the start-up of NO2-
   oxidation was unchanged, and the start-up of NH4+ oxidation was delayed.
   In all the three biofilm reactors, data sets of time series analyses on
   population dynamics of nitrifying bacteria determined by FISH, in situ
   nitrifying activities determined by microelectrode measurements, and the
   reactor performances revealed an approximate agreement between the
   appearance of nitrifying bacteria and the initiation of nitrification
   activity, suggesting that the combination of these techniques was a very
   powerful monitoring tool to evaluate the effectiveness of
   bioaugmentation and biostimulation strategies. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{In many water quality models production of dissolved organic carbon
   (DOC) is modelled as mineralisation from particulate organic matter
   (POM). In this paper it is argued that the DOC production from
   dessicated sediments by water turbulence may be of similar importance.
   The DOC production from sediments was measured under sterile conditions,
   as a function of shaking time, sediment to water ratio and OC content.
   Furthermore, the maximum fraction of particulate organic carbon (POC)
   that can be mobilised by agitation (excluding the contribution of
   mineralisation) was assessed. The experiments can be considered as
   laboratory simulations of resuspension of aquatic sediments due to
   turbulence caused by wind, benthivorous fish or dredging. It was found
   that aquatic resuspension of dessicated sediment may cause mobilisation
   of up to 100\% of indigenous particulate carbon in a few weeks. An
   empirical equation was derived that expresses mobilised carbon (DOC) as
   a function of sediment concentration (POC), OC fraction (foc) and time.
   At a typical value of 25 mg/L suspended sediment, the halflife for
   mobilisation is 0.5 day, which is much faster than bacterial degradation
   of POM in aquatic systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{By using the C-18-Empore(TM) disks/water partition coefficient (K-MD) to
   describe the toxicity of 50 mixed halogenated benzenes to Photobacterium
   phosphoreum, an approach is proposed in this study. Application of the
   approach to the 15 other related mixtures prove the predictive
   capability of this K-MD-based approach, due to the consistency between
   the predicted toxicity and the observed ones with r(2) = 0.929, SE =
   0.104, F = 169.513 at P<0.001. Further analysis of this approach finds
   that, for the mixtures, although the toxicity is highly correlated with
   their hydrophobicity, this correlation is free from the range difference
   of the hydrophobicity, the ratio or the number of the individual
   chemicals. These analysis results suggest that this K-MD-based approach
   is able to predict the toxicity of mixture pollutants in wastewater. (C)

Abstract = {{This research was conducted as a part of the continuous development of a
   novel technique for managing fish-processing wastewater by cultivating
   proteolytic yeast, Candida rugopelliculosa, as possible diet of the
   rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis. It was feasible to use Alaska Pollack
   processing wastewater as a growth medium for C rugopelliculosa, which
   was stimulatory for growth of the rotifer by 18.3\% over the commercial
   diet of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Maximum growth of C rugopelliculosa
   and reduction of influent soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD)
   concentration were respectively (6.09+/-0.04) x 10(6) cells/ml and
   70.0\% at 6.3 h hydraulic retention time (HRT).
   Method of 4th order Runge-Kutta approximation was successfully applied
   to determine the Monod kinetics of C rugopelliculosa by using unsteady
   state data from only one continuous unsteady state operation at a fixed
   HRT. The maximum microbial growth rates, mu(max), and half saturation
   coefficient, K-s, were determined to be 0.82 +/- 0.22 h(-1) and
   690+/-220mg SCOD/L, respectively. The microbial yield coefficient, Y,
   and microbial decay rate coefficient, k(d), were determined to be (1.39
   +/- 0.22) x 10(4) cells/mg SCOD and 0.06+/-0.01 h(-1), respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{A coagulation-flocculation treatment has been applied to a
   slaughterhouse liquid effluent, using ferric sulphate as coagulant and
   activated silica, powdered activated carbon, cationic polyacrylamide,
   polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid and anionic polyacrylamide as
   coagulant aids in order to improve the settling time.
   Once the optimal conditions had been established (speed and time of
   stirring during flocculation step, pH, coagulant and coagulant aid
   doses), the efficiency of the coagulation-flocculation process was
   studied by comparing the particle size distribution before and after the
   addition of the coagulant.
   When ferric sulphate was used without the coagulant aids, particle
   removal efficiency varied with size, although overall efficiency was
   quite substantial (87\%). The use of coagulant aids improved the removal
   efficiency, except in the case of activated silica, when it fell to
   78\%. In all other cases removal efficiency values between 93\% (for
   polyvinyl alcohol) and 99\% (for anionic polyacrylamide) were reached.

Abstract = {{The biodegradability of water samples is usually estimated with
   bioassays under oxic conditions. In order to overcome some of the
   drawbacks linked to the incubation of the samples in aerobic batches, a
   new protocol is proposed and tested, which is based on an organic carbon
   (OC) balance after a 45 days incubation under anoxic conditions with
   excess nitrate. The biodegradable fractions of organic matter obtained
   with the anoxic protocol are slightly lower than those obtained under
   oxic conditions. Several possible reasons for a systematic
   underestimation of the biodegradable organic matter under anoxic
   conditions are evaluated and discussed: a reduced microbial metabolic
   potential, significantly reduced degradation rates for the slowly
   biodegradable organic matter, an additional production of refractory
   organic compounds during the incubation, or the inhibition of the
   recycling of the organic matter stored in bacterial biomass.
   Nevertheless, the 7\% difference observed on the biodegradable total OC
   estimations keeps low enough so that the anoxic protocol can be proposed
   as a convenient alternative to the oxic one. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

   treatment with lime in the presence of increasing doses of ferrous

Abstract = {{A two-stage pilot-scale thermophilic aerobic suspended carrier biofilm
   process (SCBP) was set up for the on-site treatment of pulp and paper
   mill whitewater lining. The microbial diversity in this process was
   analyzed by length heterogeneity analysis of PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal
   DNA. The primer pair selected for PCR amplification was first evaluated
   by a computational analysis of fragment lengths in ten main
   phylogenetical eubacterial groups. The fragment contained the first
   third of the 16S rRNA gene, which was shown to vary naturally between
   465 and 563 bp in length. The length heterogeneity analysis of
   polymerase chain reaction (LH-PCR) profile of the biomass attached to
   carrier elements was found to be diverse in both stages of the SCBP.
   During normal operating conditions, sequences belonging to
   beta-Proteobacteria, Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides group and
   gamma-Proteobacteria were assigned to the most prominent LH-PCR peak.
   Samples from the suspended biomass consisted of completely different
   bacterial populations, which were, however, similar in the serial
   reactors. The pilot process experienced alkaline shocks, after which
   Bacillus-like sequences were detected in both the biofilm and suspended
   biomass. However, when the conditions were reversed, the normal
   microbial population in the biofilm recovered rapidly without further
   biomass inoculations. This study shows that LH-PCR is a valuable method
   for profiling microbial diversity and dynamics in industrial wastewater
   processes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of NaCl on thermophilic (55degreesC) methanol conversion in
   the presence of excess of sulfate (COD/SO42-=0.5) was investigated in
   two 6.5L lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactors inoculated with
   granular sludge previously not adapted to NaCl. Methanol was almost
   completely used for sulfate reduction in the absence of NaCl when
   operating at an organic loading rate of 5 g COD L-1 day(-1) and a
   hydraulic retention time of 10 h. The almost fully sulfidogenic sludge
   consisted of both granules and flocs developed after approximately 100
   days in both reactors. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) outcompeted
   methane producing archaea (MPA) for methanol, but acetate represented a
   side-product, accounting for maximal 25\% of the total COD converted.
   Either MPA or SRB did not use acetate as substrate in activity tests.
   High NaCl concentrations (25 g L-1) completely inhibited methanol
   degradation, whereas low salt concentrations (2.5 g NaCl L-1) provoked
   considerable changes in the metabolic fate of methanol. The MPA were
   most sensitive towards the NaCl shock (25 g L-1). In contrast, the
   addition of 2.5 g L-1 of NaCl stimulated MPA and homoacetogenic
   bacteria. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study makes a comparison between the nitrification performance of
   TNCU-1 (a combined activated sludge-otating biological contactor
   process) and A2O systems by the use of a pilot plant and batch
   experiments. The nitrifier abundance in both systems was determined,
   using cloning-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and
   fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH), to investigate the role of
   rotating biological contactor in the TNCU-1 process. The stability of
   the nitrification performance and the specific nitrification rate were
   found to be greater in TNCU-1 system than in the A2O system. RBC biofilm
   promoted nitrifying activity that contributed to the nitrification
   performance, especially at a low SRT. By using the cloning-DGGE method,
   the genera Nitrosospira and Nitrospira were found to be present in all
   the samples, while the genus Nitrosomonas was observed only in the
   TNCU-I RBC biofilm. In addition, the proportions of ammonia oxidizer in
   the TNCU-1 RBC biofilm, the TNCU-I activated sludge and the A20
   activated sludge were 11.4\%, 13.2\%, and 4.1\%, respectively, higher
   than the nitrite oxidizer fractions of 3.3\%, 5.7\% and 2.1\%,
   respectively, according to the cloning-DGGE method. On the other hand,
   the proportions of ammonia oxidizers in the afore-mention materials were
   10.3\%, 13.7\%, and 5.2\%, higher than the nitrite oxidizer fractions of
   2.5\%, 3.6\% and 2.3\%, according to the FISH experiments. This implies
   that the proportion of ammonia oxidizer in the TNCU-I process was 3.2
   and 2.6 times that in the A20 process, determined by the cloning-DGGE
   and FISH methods, respectively. These amounts are also close to the
   ammonia oxidization rate of 2.9 times. All the data show that RBC added
   to the aerobic zone of TNCU-1 process would increase the nitrifier
   abundance and enhance the nitrification performance of the system. (C)

Abstract = {{Electric fields and currents have been shown to be capable of
   disinfecting drinking water and reducing the numbers of bacteria and
   yeast in food. However, little research has been conducted regarding the
   effectiveness of electric fields and currents in the inactivation of
   viruses. The objective of this study was to compare the ability of
   bacteria and bacteriophage to survive exposure to direct electric
   current in an electrochemical cell, where they would be subject to
   irreversible membrane permeabilization processes, direct oxidation of
   cellular/viral constituents by electric current, and disinfection by
   electrochemically generated oxidants. Suspensions of the bacteria
   Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacteriophage MS2 and
   PRD1 at both high (approximately 1 X 10(6) CFU or PFU/mL) and low
   (approximately 1 X 10(3) CFU or PFU/mL) population densities were
   exposed to currents ranging from 25 to 3 50 mA in 5s pulses.
   Post-exposure plaque counts of the bacteriophage were proportionally
   higher than bacterial culturable counts at corresponding current
   exposures. E coli and MS2 were then exposed to 5 mA for 20 min at both
   high and low population densities. The inactivation rate of E coli was
   2.1-4.3 times greater than that of MS2. Both bacteria and bacteriophage
   were more resistant to exposure to direct current at higher population
   densities. Also, amelioration of inactivation within the electrochemical
   cell by the reducing agent glutathione indicates the major mechanism of
   inactivation in the electrochemical cell is disinfection by
   electrochemically generated oxidants. The implications of these results
   are that technologies relying upon direct current to reduce the numbers
   of microbes in food and water may not be sufficient to reduce the
   numbers of potentially pathogenic viruses and ensure the safety of the
   treated food or water. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biosorption of high molecular weight humic substances (HS) to activated
   sludge (AS) biomass may be considered as a preliminary step previous to
   enzymatic hydrolysis breakdown and biological uptake. Two standard HS,
   Suwannee River humic and fulvic acids, were biosorbed onto live AS
   biomass collected from full-scale wastewater treatment plants.
   Biosorption isotherms were corrected for interference from organic
   matter desorbed from AS biomass. The effect of pH, calcium and ionic
   strength on biosorption was tested. HS biosorption to live AS biomass
   obeyed the Freundlich isotherm equation. Biosorption increased with
   decreasing pH, increasing calcium and ionic strength concentration.
   Higher biosorption at low pH may be attributed to hydrophobic
   interactions between HS and AS biomass extracellular polymers (EPS).
   Hydrophobic and cationic bridging effects between HS and AS EPS were the
   mechanisms responsible for biosorption under the presence of divalent
   cations; however, the former was most significant at low pH, whereas the
   latter was predominant near neutral pH. The effect of ionic strength on
   HS biosorption followed the colloidal chemistry theory as the electric
   double layer became compressed when the ionic strength increased,
   resulting in closer approach of HS and AS biomass. The humic acid
   fraction of Suwannee River was removed more efficiently than its fulvic
   acid fraction because the humic acid was more hydrophobic. These results
   showed that pH, divalent cation concentration and ionic strength play an
   important role in the fate and removal of influent wastewater HS in
   full-scale treatment plants. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ability of pulsed laser irradiations to cause damage on the
   biofouling organisms is recently being investigated. If this technique
   is employed in industries such as power generation wherein a large
   quantity of water is being used for the cooling purpose, many organisms
   other than the targeted would get affected. In this study, we have
   investigated the damage caused by the pulsed laser irradiations from an
   Nd:YAG laser (fluence 0.1 J/cm(2)) for varying durations such as 2, 5,
   10, 30, 60 and 300 s on two marine diatom species namely Skeletonema
   costatum and Chaetoceros gracilis. Upon exposure to low power laser
   irradiations, these diatom species showed mortalities between 52.6 +/-
   9.3\% to 97.7 +/- 3.1\% in the case of S. costatum and 57.8 +/- 2.5\% to
   98.9 +/- 0.6\% in the case of C gracilis for 2 and 300s of irradiations,
   respectively. The mortality increased with the increase in the duration
   of laser irradiation. The estimation of the chlorophyll a concentration
   in the irradiated samples showed a considerable reduction varying
   between 9.8\% and 57\% in C gracilis and 3\% and 70.3\% in S. costatum
   for 2 and 300 s of irradiations, respectively. The laser-survived cells
   grew as the non-irradiated (control) samples. C gracilis frustules were
   broken by the laser whilst, the cell materials were drained out of the
   frustules in the case of S. costatum. The study therefore showed that
   the low power pulsed laser irradiations could cause significant damage
   on the two species of planktonic diatoms. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The kinetics of desorption of in situ chlorobenzenes, PAHs, and PCBs
   from four different sediments was studied employing Tenax beads as an
   infinite sink for sorbates. Rate constants for slow desorption were
   2.9+/-0.4 x 10(-2) h(-1), irrespective of the extent of sorbate
   planarity. Rate constants for very slow desorption were 2.1+/-0.5 x
   10(-4) and 6.7+/-1.4 x 10(-4) h(-1) for planar and non-planar compounds,
   respectively. Comparison with literature data suggests a priori
   estimates for rate constants for slow desorption to be 3 x 10(-2) h(-1),
   and to be 2 x 10(-4) and 7 x 10(-4) h(-1) for very slow desorption of
   planar and non-planar compounds, respectively. The ratio between the
   fractions in the very slowly desorbing domain and the rapidly desorbing
   domain was 15-38 for planar compounds which is higher than for nonplanar
   compounds for which the ratio was 2.8-5.2. The ratio between the
   fractions in the slowly desorbing domain and the rapidly desorbing
   domain was 1.3-1.8 and independent of the sorbate planarity. The
   difference in influence of sorbate planarity on the very slowly
   desorbing domain as compared to the slowly desorbing domain points to
   different environments for the slowly and the very slowly desorbing
   fractions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tree fern, an agricultural by-product, was used for the sorptive removal
   of copper ions from aqueous solution. The experimental data was analysed
   by Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson isotherms. The equilibrium
   sorption capacity of copper ions was determined from the Langmuir
   equation and found to be 11.7 mg/g. A batch sorption model, based on the
   assumption of the pseudo-second-order mechanism, was developed to
   predict the rate constant of sorption, the equilibrium sorption capacity
   and the initial sorption rate with the effect of initial copper ion
   concentration and the tree fern dose. Various thermodynamic parameters,
   such as DeltaG(0), DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0), have been calculated. The
   thermodynamics of copper ion/tree fern system indicates spontaneous and
   endothermic nature of the process. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The responses of a steady-state, continuous-flow, completely-mixed
   fluidized bed reactor (FBR) to a range of monoethylamine (MEA) impulses
   are analyzed in terms of its combined carbon oxidation and nitrification
   efficiencies. Immobilized cells are cultivated at a mean cell residence
   time (MCRT) that exceeds 75 days. Responses due to bacterial activities
   and physical flows are separately estimated using a methodology based on
   mass balance calculations. MEA inhibition becomes evident when
   respective critical impulse loadings are exceeded, i.e., 0.12 mg TOC/mg
   VS for carbon oxidation and 0.021 mg TOC/mg VS for nitrification (TOC:
   total organic carbon, VS: volatile solids). Nitrifying cells are shown
   to be more susceptible to MEA impulses than their heterotrophic
   counterparts. However, the presence of nitrification activities under
   the conditions tested demonstrates the advantages of cell immobilization
   that offer greater flexibility when challenged with suddenly increased
   MEA loads over a short period of time. Mass balance calculations on
   nitrogen species confirms that 0.583 mg NH4+-N is produced per mg MEA-C
   removed when the assimilatory nitrogen requirements for cell synthesis
   are negligible. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) by ferrous-catalyzed
   hydrogen peroxide was quantified and modeled in the study. TCP was
   effectively degraded by hydroxyl radicals that were generated by
   Fe(II)/H2O2 in the oxidation process. The oxidation capacity (OC) of the
   process depends on the concentrations of oxidant (hydrogen peroxide) and
   oxidative catalyst (ferrous ion). Up to 99.6\% of TCP removal can be
   achieved in the process, provided the doses of Fe(II) and H2O2 are
   selected correctly. The OC of the process was successfully predicted
   through a kinetic approach in a two-stage model with some simple and
   measurable parameters, which makes the model useful for predicting,
   controlling and optimizing the catalyzed oxidation process in the
   degradation of TCP. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three series of batch tests at 25degreesC were performed to determine
   the benzoic acid and p-nitrophenol (PNP) binary adsorption isotherms
   onto GAC in the aqueous solutions and the experimental data were fitted
   to the extended Langmuir isotherm model successfully. The experimental
   data and the isotherm model parameters showed that the GAC used in this
   study had a higher affinity to PNP than benzoic acid. Three column tests
   were performed to determine the breakthrough curves and effluent
   solution pH with varying feed compositions. According to the
   experimental results, the weakly adsorbed BA exhibited an intermediate
   zone of effluent concentration higher than its feed one; the effluent
   solution pH could serve as a good indicator for breakthrough. The
   breakthrough curves with varying feed compositions could be predicted by
   the non-linear wave propagation theory satisfactorily. Only the
   adsorption isotherm models were required to construct the composition
   path diagram with which the breakthrough curves could be predicted. (C)

Abstract = {{Chronic toxicity tests carried out on species of the genus Daphnia
   (Crustacea: Cladocera) are bioassays commonly used in ecotoxicology.
   Mortality in the cohorts exposed to toxicants can be examined by the
   analysis of survival curves. The shape of these curves may be very
   different because of inter-individual heterogeneity: the less
   rectangular is the shape the more different is the probability of dying
   of daphnids in the cohort. Aim of this paper is to analyze the
   characteristics-in particular the shape-of survival curves of cohorts of
   Daphnia magna exposed to heavy metals in chronic toxicity tests.
   Experimental curves were fitted by a mathematical model recently
   proposed, which puts emphasis just on this heterogeneity, described by
   the parameter of the model S-0. The information contained in S-0 is very
   useful for the present purposes: the higher the value of S-0 the less
   rectangular the shape of the curve and, as a consequence, the higher the
   age-at-death heterogeneity of the cohort is thought to be. The model
   contains a second parameter, omega, representing the maximum potential
   ability of the individuals to survive in a specific environment and is
   related with the maximal life span. The model fitted well the survival
   curves in most cases and both S-0 and omega showed statistically
   different values between treatments, useful for comparisons. It was
   concluded that S-0 provides a quantitative estimation of curve
   ``rectangularization{''}, useful to check different sensitivities to a
   specific toxicant concentration among daphnids belonging to the same
   cohort, while omega provides an estimate of maximal life span. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{This study is part of a larger research project on Advanced Treatments
   for wastewater reuse in agriculture. Because of Italy's strict
   microbiological limits on unrestricted wastewater reuse in agriculture
   (2 MPN/ 100 ml Total Coliforms), a very high degree of disinfection is
   necessary.
   The objective of this study is to proceed in validating, with a pilot
   plant experimentation, previous laboratory results on the disinfection
   efficacy of the synergic combined treatment between ultraviolet
   irradiation (UV) and peracetic acid (PAA). The research has been carried
   out through a 5 month on-site experimental study in a pilot plant,
   considering four different solutions: PAA addition, UV irradiation,
   addition of PAA upstream the UV device (PAA + UV) and addition of PAA
   downstream the UV device (UV + PAA).
   In the investigated experimental conditions (2-8 ppm of PAA with 10-30
   min contact time; 100-300 mJ/cm(2) UV), it has been impossible to meet
   the microbiological limits through an exclusive use of UV irradiation or
   PAA. The disinfection efficacy enhances by using the UV + PAA treatment,
   but a much higher efficacy gain occurs by using the PAA + UV treatment.
   In this latter case, the higher efficiency is recognized as being
   brought about by the formation of free radicals due to the photolysis of
   the PAA when in presence of the UV rays. A preliminary cost analysis has
   been carried out in order to highlight the more economically
   advantageous solution which guarantees compliance to the strict limits.

Abstract = {{The enhanced ultrasonic decomposition of 1,4-dioxane by the addition of
   ferrous iron (Fe(II)) was investigated at 205, 358, 618, and 1071 kHz.
   The total organic carbon (TOC) remaining was also determined at each
   frequency. Addition of Fe(II) improved the 1,4-dioxane decomposition
   rate and mineralization efficiency at all frequencies studied. A nearly
   four-fold increase of the rate constant was observed at the optimal
   Fe(II) concentration and a frequency of 205 kHz. In the presence and
   absence of the iron, the fastest overall degradation and mineralization
   of 1,4-dioxane took place at 358 kHz where 95\% of the initial
   1,4-dioxane was removed after 50 min. Finally, although reduced, the
   ultrasonic decomposition of 1,4-dioxane was still significant at all
   frequencies in the presence of the hydroxyl radical scavenger

Abstract = {{A knowledge-based approach for the supervision of the deflocculation
   problem in activated sludge processes was considered and successfully
   applied to a full-scale plant. To do that, a methodology that integrates
   on-line, off-line and heuristic information has been proposed. This
   methodology consists of three steps: (i) development of a decision tree
   (which involves knowledge acquisition and representation); (ii)
   implementation into a rule-based system; and (iii) validation. The set
   of symptoms most useful in diagnosing the deflocculation problem has
   been identified, the different branches to diagnose pin-point floc and
   dispersed growth have been built (using generic and specific knowledge),
   and all this knowledge has been codified into an object-oriented shell.
   The results obtained in the application of this knowledge based approach
   to the Granollers WWTP (which treats about 130,000
   inhabitants-equivalents) showed that the system was able to identify
   correctly the problem with reasonable accuracy. Our positive experience
   building this system suggests that this approach is a practical and
   valuable element to include in an intelligent supervisory system
   combining numerical and reasoning techniques. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Extracellular polymeric substances were extracted from activated sludge
   using a resin exchange method and analyzed. The separation and
   identification of EPS were carried out by size exclusion chromatography
   and Fourier transform infrared micro-spearoscopy. Chromatograms of
   extracted EPS exhibited seven peaks. Proteins varying in molecular
   weights from 670 to 45 kDa were present in all the peaks.
   Polysaccharides corresponding to molecular weights of similar to 1 and
   similar to 0.5 kDa were present in only three peaks. Strong association
   of polysaccharides and proteins was observed. Infrared results revealed
   the presence of one type of polysaccharide and two types of proteins (A
   and B). Proteins differed mainly in the length of their associated alkyl
   chains and in the ratio of ester/acidic functionalities. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The denitrification process was studied in a stirred lab-scale suspended
   carrier biofilm reactor at low temperatures (3-20degreesC). The reactor
   was filled to 50\% with Kaldnes K1 carriers. The denitrification rate
   showed only a rather weak dependence on the temperature, the rate at
   3degreesC being approximately 55\% of that at 15degreesC. The maximum
   denitrification rate obtained at 15degreesC was 2.7 g NOx- -Nm(-2)
   carrier d(-1). The maximum denitrification rate at 3degreesC during an
   8-day period was found to be constant. During the 8 days, the hydraulic
   retention time was approximately 1.5 h and the inlet NO3--N
   concentration was 30mgl(-1). (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Elecrtochemical degradation of phenol was evaluated at five typical
   anodes for mineralization to carbon dioxide or for being a pre-treatment
   method in toxic aromatic compounds. Three kinds of RuO2-base electrodes
   were prepared by thermal deposition, which were coated by the oxides of
   Ru or by Ru, Sn and Sb or by Ru, Sn, Sb and Gd on Ti metal surface,
   respectively. Another electrode Ti/ PbO2 was prepared by
   electro-deposition method with PbO2 coated on Ti. A Pt electrode was
   chosen for comparison. Characteristics of the typical five electrodes
   were investigated by cyclic voltammetry, SEM and its degradation ability
   for phenol. Performance for phenol degradation of the three RuO2
   electrodes lie in: Ti/Sb-Sn-RuO2-Gd > Ti/Sb-Sn-RuO2 > Ti/RuO2 and the
   electrode with beta-PbO2 coating was superior to RuO2-based electrodes
   and Pt electrode. Aromatic ring opening take place at all researched
   electrodes and it is supposed that electrolysis run stop at different
   intermediates, such as benzoquinone, maleic acid, etc. Under the present
   experimental conditions, whole mineralization to CO2 takes place only in
   the beta-PbO2 anode. A pathway of electrochemical degradation of phenol
   was suggested based on the experimental analysis. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The use of vegetation to remediate soil contaminated by recalcitrant
   hydrocarbons was tested under field conditions. Specifically, an
   evaluation was made of the effectiveness of deep rooting grasses,
   Johnsongrass and Canadian wild rye in the dissipation of TNT and PBB's
   in the soils freshly contaminated to an initial concentration of 10.17
   +/- 1.35 for TNT and 9.87 +/- 1.23 mg/kg for PBB. The experiment used 72
   (1.5 m long and 0.1 m diameter) column lysimeters with four treatments:
   Johnsongrass; wild rye grass; a rotation of Johnsongrass and wild rye
   grass; and unplanted fallow conditions. In the laboratory, immunoassay
   test procedures determined the TNT and PBB concentrations in the soil,
   leachate, herbage and root samples. The root characteristics such as
   total root length, rooting density, and root surface area were
   quantified to a depth of 1.5 m. Changes in microbial biomass were
   assessed for both rhizosphere soil and the bulk soil during the 2-year
   study. The largest and most rapid loss in soil chemical concentration
   was for TNT, which decreased to less than 250 mug/kg, the detection
   limit, by 93 days after germination. The PBB was at or near the
   detection limit of 500 mug/kg by 185 days after germination. There was
   no perceptible difference in contaminant concentration in the soil
   between the vegetation treatments and/or with depth. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An important advance in aquatic ecotoxicology is the development and
   application of biomimetic sampling technology for hydrophobic
   contaminants. In this paper, accumulation kinetics of five
   organochlorinated pesticides, i.e. hexachlorobenzene, lindan, aldrin,
   heptachlor epoxide and 4,4'-DDT, by triolein-containing semipermeable
   membrane device (triolein-SPMD) and by fish (rainbow trout) were
   compared in a laboratory continuous flow system. Accumulation kinetics
   of organochlorinated pesticides by the triolein-SPMD and by rainbow
   trout were linear during the exposure period of 20 d, except for lindan.
   Approach of an asymptote could be observed for lindan at the end of the
   exposure for rainbow trout. When the kinetic data were used to calculate
   the first-order uptake rate constants, it was found that the uptake
   rates of the chemicals in triolein-SPMD were 1-2.5 times higher than
   those in the fish. The estimated bioconcentration factors of the five
   pesticides in rainbow trout were in the range of 1000-7000 and the
   device concentration factor in the range of 1500-18000. Although
   equilibrium was not reached for most pesticides under 21-d exposure
   period, correlations between C-L/C-w and K-ow (R-2 = 0.887) and C-f/C-w
   and K-ow (R-2 = 0.931) could be observed which was a clear indication
   that triolein-SPMD accumulates chlorinated pesticides in a quite similar
   way as fish do. Our results show that triolein-SPMD could serve as a
   good surrogate for rainbow trout for simulating accumulations of
   chlorinated pesticides and may be used as a universal surrogate for fish
   in natural waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A rational use of water in the leather industry is described by applying
   the criteria of ``clean technologies{''} by means of membrane processes.
   A nanofiltration (NF) process was used for recovering tannins and water
   from exhausted baths and reusing them as tanning agents and washings.
   Results of experiments performed on laboratory and semi-industrial pilot
   scale plants, operating and fluid-dynamic conditions and mass balance of
   the NF process are reported and discussed. Chemical and physical
   analytical values measured on skins treated with the recovered solutions
   were very similar to those measured on control skins tanned with
   standard solutions. According to the obtained results, a process scheme
   is suggested. It permits both to recover water and to increase the
   tannin/non tannin (T/NT) ratio in the retentate solution, starting from
   exhausted tanning baths and by using a NF membrane
   purification/concentration. The final volume reduction factor of tested
   exhausted baths was 5.25, the increase of T/NT ratio was from 1.1 to 2.3
   and the average permeate flux was 12.5 l/m(2) h. Advantages are in terms
   of. reduction of environmental impact (up to 75\% of COD reduction of
   the global effluent), simplification of cleaning-up processes of
   wastewaters, decrease of disposal costs, saving of chemicals and water.

Abstract = {{As input to the steady state design and kinetic simulation models for
   the activated sludge system, the correct value for the heterotroph
   anoxic yield is essential to provide reliable estimates for the system
   denitrification potential. This paper examines activated sludge anoxic
   yield values in the literature, and presents experimental data
   quantifying the value. In the literature, in terms of the structure of
   ASM1 and similar models, theoretically it has been shown that the anoxic
   yield should be reduced to approximately 0.79 the value of the aerobic
   yield. This theoretical value is validated with data from corresponding
   aerobic OUR and anoxic nitrate time profiles in a batch fed laboratory
   scale long sludge age activated sludge system treating municipal
   wastewater. The value also is in close agreement with values in the
   literature measured with both artificial substrates and municipal
   wastewater. Thus, it is concluded that, in ASM1 and similar models, for
   an aerobic yield of 0.67 mg COD/mg COD, the anoxic yield should be about
   0.53 mg COD/mg COD. Including such a lower anoxic yield in ASM1 and
   similar models will result in a significant increase in denitrification
   potential, due to increased denitrification with wastewater RBCOD as
   substrate. In terms of the structure of ASM3, for the proposed substrate
   storage yields and the aerobic yield of 0.63 mg COD/mg COD, experimental
   data indicate that the corresponding anoxic yield should be about 0.42
   mg COD/mg COD. This is significantly lower than the proposed value of
   0.54 mg COD/mg COD, and requires further investigation. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The system design based on the photodegradation kinetics of
   4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl (4,4'-DCB) in surfactant solution with the aid of
   solvents (acetone and/or squalane) has been studied. Organic solvents
   acetone and squalane were added as a photosensitizer and a hydrogen
   source, respectively, to achieve better photolysis performance. The
   quantum yield of 4,4'-DCB photodecay in Tween 80 micellar solution in
   the presence of added acetone was increased from 0.032 to 0.043 at its
   optimal condition. Acetone was shown to be an effective photosensitizer
   at low concentration, but an overdose would quench the reaction.
   Furthermore, the addition of squalane could further promote the
   photodechlorination of 4,4'-DCB in the Tween 80/acetone solutions for an
   additional 59\% of rate improvement. However, an overdose of either
   solvent was found to cause UV light attenuation and to reduce the
   observed quantum yield. This effect has been justified and quantified in
   this study by a proposed light attenuation model, which has also been
   incorporated into the kinetic equation so that the resulted formula can
   be used to design the UV reactors for water and wastewater treatment
   works. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the effect of temperature on the
   solubilization of heavy metals from contaminated river sediment by
   sulfur oxidizing bacteria taken from Ell-Ren River sediment. Of three
   temperatures tested (25degreesC, 37degreesC and 55degreesC), pH decrease
   was greatest at 37degreesC, indicating that, after acclimation,
   bacterial oxidizing activity is greatest at this temperature. At
   55degreesC, pH change was similar to that which occurred with no
   inoculum added. The increase in sulfates and high pH at 55degreesC
   indicate that the indirect mechanism was not initiated at this
   temperature. Solubilization efficiency of total extractable Ni, Zn, Cu
   and Cr was high ( > 90\%) at 37degreesC, whilst that of Pb was only
   60.4\%. Except for Pb, the optimal temperature for solubilization of
   total extractable heavy metal was 37degreesC. The order of average
   solubilization efficiency of total extractable heavy metals was Ni, Zn,
   Cu > Cr > Co, Pb. The solubilization efficiency of Pb and Co was
   markedly less than that of other heavy metals. Transfer of heavy metals
   between binding fractions was most apparent at 55degreesC before and
   after bioleaching. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface charge quantification of polymer solutions and sludge
   suspensions were investigated by the colloid titration technique and
   compared to charge densities obtained by pH-titration. The colloid
   titration technique worked well for polymer samples. The charge quantity
   of humic acid and activated sludge extracellular polymers (EPS) was
   estimated to be -1.51 and -0.42 meq/g, respectively. These values are
   reasonable when compared to pH-titration results. The surface charge of
   activated sludge particles appears to be below the limit of detection.
   However, surface charge estimates are obtained, when the reactant doses
   and sample concentration are increased. It is suggested that such
   estimates are not correct, but artefacts of the non-stoichiometric
   precipitation of the polymeric reactants at high doses. It appears that
   the colloid titration method is limited to conditions of low reactant
   doses and valid for charge determination of extracted sludge polymers,
   whereas the method is not valid for charge determination of whole
   sludge. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For partial acidogenesis of cheese-whey wastewater, a set of experiments
   were carried out to produce short-chain volatile fatty acids (VFA) in
   laboratory-scale continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTR). The maximum
   rate of acetic and butyric acid production associated with simultaneous
   changes in hydraulic retention time (HRT), pH, and temperature was
   investigated, in which the degree of acidification of the whey to the
   short-chain VFAs was less than 20\% of the influent chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) concentration. Response surface methodology was
   successfully applied to determine the optimum physiological conditions
   where the maximum rates of acetic and butyric acid production occurred.
   These were 0.40-day HRT, pH 6.0 at 54.1degreesC and 0.22-day HRT, pH 6.5
   at 51.9degreesC, respectively.
   The optimum conditions for acetic acid production were selected for
   partial acidification of cheese-whey wastewater because of a higher rate
   in combined productions of acetic and butyric acids than that at optimum
   conditions for butyric acid production. A thermophilic two-phase process
   with the partial acidification followed by a methanation step was
   operated. Performance of the two-phase process was compared to the
   single-phase anaerobic system. The two-phase process clearly showed a
   better performance in management of cheese-whey wastewater over the
   single-phase system. Maximum rate of COD removal and the rate of methane
   production in the two-phase process were, respectively, 116\% and 43\%
   higher than those of the single-phase system. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Steel manufacturing byproducts were tested as a means of treating mine
   tailing leachate with a high As concentration. Byproduct materials can
   be placed in situ as permeable reactive barriers to control the
   subsurface release of leachate from tailing containment systems. The
   tested materials had various compositions of elemental Fe, Fe oxides,
   Ca-Fe oxides and Ca hydroxides typical of different steel manufacturing
   processes. Among these materials, evaporation cooler dust (ECD), oxygen
   gas sludge (OGS), basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS) and to a lesser
   degree, electrostatic precipitator dust (EPD) effectively removed both
   As(V) and As(III) during batch experiments. ECD, OGS and BOFS reduced As
   concentrations to <0.5 mg/l from 25 mg/l As(V) or As(III) solution in 72
   h, exhibiting higher removal capacities than zero-valent iron. High Ca
   concentrations and alkaline conditions (pH ca. 12) provided by the
   dissolution of Ca hydroxides may promote the formation of stable,
   sparingly soluble Ca-As compounds. When initial pH conditions were
   adjusted to 4, As reduction was enhanced, probably by adsorption onto
   iron oxides. The elution rate of retained As from OGS and ECD decreased
   with treatment time, and increasing the residence time in a permeable
   barrier strategy would be beneficial for the immobilization of As. When
   applied to real tailing leachate, ECD was found to be the most efficient
   barrier material to increase pH and to remove As and dissolved metals.

Abstract = {{This study focused on the appropriate catalyst preparation and operating
   conditions for maximizing catalytic reduction efficiency of nitrate into
   nitrogen gas from groundwater. Batch experiments were conducted with
   prepared Pd and/or Cu catalysts with hydrogen gas supplied under
   specific operating conditions. It has been found that Pd-Cu combined
   catalysts prepared at a mass ratio of 4:1 can maximize the nitrate
   reduction into nitrogen gas. With an increase in the quantity of the
   catalysts, both nitrite intermediates and ammonia can be kept at a low
   level. It has also been found that the catalytic activity is mainly
   affected by the mass ratio of hydrogen gas to nitrate nitrogen, and
   hydrogen gas gauge pressure. Appropriate operating values of H-2/NO3-N
   ratio, hydrogen gas gauge pressure, pH, and initial nitrate
   concentration have been determined to be 44.6 g H-2/g N, 0.15 atm, 5.2
   (-), 100 mg L-1 for maximizing the catalytic reduction of nitrate from

Abstract = {{The degradation of methylmercury chloride by hydroxyl radicals
   ((OH)-O-.) has been investigated using nitrate photolysis from 285 to
   800 nm with a 450 W Xenon lamp as the (OH)-O-. source. The identified
   products are Hg2+, Hg-0, CHCl3 and formaldehyde. The second-order rate
   constant at pH of 5 at room temperature was determined to be 9.83(+
   -0.66) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) using benzoic acid as the (OH)-O-. scavenger.
   The effects of chloride concentration and methylmercury speciation have
   also been investigated. A mechanism of the CH3HgCl-(OH)-O-. reaction has
   been proposed. The calculated methylmercury degradation rates in natural
   waters using the above rate constant were comparable to the in situ
   photodegradation rates reported previously, indicating that degradation
   by (OH)-O-. may be one of the important pathways of methylmercury
   degradation in sunlit surface waters. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study constructed a genetically engineered Escherichia coli JM109
   which simultaneously expressed nickel transport system and
   metallothionein to remove and recover Ni2+ from aqueous solution.
   Bioaccumulation process was rapid and followed linearized Langmuir
   isotherm. A more than six-fold increase of Ni2+ binding capacity was
   obtained by genetically engineered E coli cells compared with original
   host E coli cells. A pH assay showed genetically engineered E coli cells
   accumulated Ni2+ effectively over a broad range of pH (4-10). The
   presence of 1000 mg/L Na+ and Ca2+, or 50 mg/L Cd2+ or Pb2+ did not have
   a significant effect on Ni2+ bioaccumulation, while Mg2+, Hg2+ and Cu2+
   posed a severe adverse influence on Ni2+ uptake by genetically
   engineered E coli. Furthermore, genetically engineered E coli cells did
   not require extra nutrients for Ni2+ bioaccumulation. (C) 2003 Elsevier

   throughout intensive agricultural areas (nonpoint source pollution).
   Current processes (e.g., ion exchange, membrane separation) for NO3-
   removal have various disadvantages. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate an electrocatalytic reduction process to selectively remove
   NO3- from groundwater associated with small agricultural communities. A
   commercially available ELAT (E-Tek Inc., Natick, MA) carbon cloth with a
   30\% surface coated Rh (rhodium) (1 mug cm(-1)) was tested at an applied
   potential of -1.5 V versus standard calomel electrode (SCE) with a Pt
   auxiliary electrode. Electrocatalytic reduction process (electrolysis)
   of NO3- was tested with cyclic voltammetry (CV) in samples containing
   NO3- and 0.1 M NaClO4-. Nitrate and NO2- concentrations in test
   solutions and groundwater samples were analyzed by ion chromatography
   (IC). The presence of Rh on the carbon cloth surface resulted in current
   increase of 36\% over uncoated carbon cloths. The electrocatalysis
   experiments using Rh coated carbon cloth resulted in reduction of NO3-
   and NO2- on a timescale of minutes. Nitrite is produced as a product,
   but is rapidly consumed upon further electrolysis. Field groundwater
   samples subjected to electrocatalysis experiments, without the addition
   of NaClO4- electrolyte, also exhibited removal of NO3- on a timescale of
   minutes. Overall, results suggest that at an applied potential of -1.5 V
   with respect to SCE, Rh coated carbon cloth can reduce NO3-
   concentrations in field groundwater samples from 73 to 39 mg/L (16.58 to
   8.82 mg/L as N) on a timescale range of 40-60 min. The electrocatalytic
   reduction process described in this study may prove useful for removing
   NO3- and NO2- from groundwater associated with nonpoint source
   pollution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Radial freezing experiments on wastewater models were conducted in the
   presence of imposed stirring in order to remove impurities. The studied
   samples (dilute Na-montmorillonite suspensions charged with nitrates and
   with zinc or lead) were placed inside a cylindrical annulus, cooled at a
   controlled temperature around -7 degreesC at its inner wall which
   rotated around a vertical axis. The freezing front propagated toward the
   still outer wall which was maintained at a constant temperature around
   +1 degreesC. Thanks to stirring, considerable purification rates up to
   99.97\% were attained. It was also demonstrated that combining radial
   freezing and stirring ended in residual concentrations which agreed with
   drinking water standards. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds during ozonation can
   occur via ozone or OH radicals or a combination thereof. The oxidation
   pathway is determined by the ratio of ozone and OH radical
   concentrations and the corresponding kinetics. A huge database with
   several hundred rate constants for ozone and a few thousand rate
   constants for OH radicals is available. Ozone is an electrophile with a
   high selectivity. The second-order rate constants for oxidation by ozone
   vary over 10 orders of magnitude, between <0.1 M(-1)s(-1) and about 7 x
   10(9) M(-1)s(-1). The reactions of ozone with drinking-water relevant
   inorganic compounds are typically fast and occur by an oxygen atom
   transfer reaction. Organic micropollutants are oxidized with ozone
   selectively. Ozone reacts mainly with double bonds, activated aromatic
   systems and non-protonated amines. In general, electron-donating groups
   enhance the oxidation by ozone whereas electron-withdrawing groups
   reduce the reaction rates. Furthermore, the kinetics of direct ozone
   reactions depend strongly on the speciation (acid-base, metal
   complexation). The reaction of OH radicals with the majority of
   inorganic and organic compounds is nearly diffusion-controlled.
   The degree of oxidation by ozone and OH radicals is given by the
   corresponding kinetics. Product formation from the ozonation of organic
   micropollutants in aqueous systems has only been established for a few
   compounds. It is discussed for olefines, amines and aromatic compounds.

Abstract = {{Ozone is an excellent disinfectant and can even be used to inactivate
   microorganisms such as protozoa which are very resistant to conventional
   disinfectants. Proper rate constants for the inactivation of
   microorganisms are only available for six species (E coli, Bacillus
   subtilis spores, Rotavirus, Giardia lamblia cysts, Giardia muris cysts,
   Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts). The apparent activation energy for the
   inactivation of bacteria is in the same order as most chemical reactions
   (35-50 kJ mol(-1)), whereas it is much higher for the inactivation of
   protozoa (80 kJ mol(-1)). This requires significantly higher ozone
   exposures at low temperatures to get a similar inactivation for
   protozoa. Even for the inactivation of resistant microorganisms, OH
   radicals only play a minor role. Numerous organic and inorganic
   ozonation disinfection/oxidation by-products have been identified. The
   by-product of main concern is bromate, which is formed in
   bromide-containing waters. A low drinking water standard of 10 mug l(-1)
   has been set for bromate. Therefore, disinfection and oxidation
   processes have to be evaluated to fulfil these criteria. In certain
   cases, when bromide concentrations are above about 50 mug l(-1), it may
   be necessary to use control measures to lower bromate formation
   (lowering of pH, ammonia addition). Iodate is the main by-product formed
   during ozonation of iodidecontaining waters. The reactions involved are
   direct ozone oxidations. Iodate is considered non-problematic because it
   is transformed back to iodide endogenically. Chloride cannot be oxidized
   during ozonation processes under drinking water conditions. Chlorate is
   only formed if a preoxidation by chlorine and/or chlorine dioxide has
   occured. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photodeposition of small amounts of metal silver on the surface of
   titanium(IV) oxide enhances its photoactivity in phenol decomposition.
   The applied method of in situ metal photoreduction resulted in preparing
   better Ag/TiO(2) systems than those already described in literature.
   Optimum silver loading on titania amounts to 0.5wt\%. The photoreaction,
   which finally leads to total phenol mineralization, proceeds via
   intermediate compounds. Hydroquinone, benzoquinone and catechol are the
   main intermediates determined quantitatively. Photooxidation of the
   compounds competes with the photooxidation of phenol. At higher phenol
   concentration, > 6 x 10(-4) mol dm(-3), the rate of the photocatalytic
   reaction is strongly retarded. The photoreaction was conducted in a
   specially designed, three-phase fluidal photoreactor. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of the concentration of tributyltin (TBT) in feed on the
   dietary bioaccumulation of tributyltin chloride (TBTCl) was studied in
   an 8-week uptake experiment and a 4-week elimination experiment using
   red sea bream (Pagrus major). The biomagnification factor (BMF) and the
   assimilation efficiency (AE) decreased from 0.30 to 0.15 and from 13\%
   to 5.9\%, respectively, as the TBT concentration in feed increased from
   1.3 to 20 mug/g. The elimination rate constant (k(2)) was independent of
   the TBT concentration in the fish. Laboratory measurements of the BMF
   and AE of TBTCl underestimate actual field values if highly contaminated
   feed is used. Judging from the BMF and AE, the risk of the
   bioaccumulation of TBTCl through the food chain might be smaller than
   that of polychlorinated biphenyls. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The electrochemical treatment of phenolic wastewater in a continuous
   tubular reactor, constructed from a stainless steel tube with a
   cylindrical carbon anode at the centre, was investigated in this study,
   being first in literature. The effects of residence time on phenol
   removal was studied at 25degreesC, 120g l(-1) electrolyte concentration
   for 450 and 3100 mg l(-1) phenol feed concentrations with 61.4 and 54.7
   mA cm(-2) current densities, respectively. The change in phenol
   concentration and pH of the reaction medium was monitored in every run
   and GC/MS analyses were performed to determine the fate of intermediate
   products formed during the electrochemical reaction in a specified batch
   run. During the electrolysis mono, di- and tri-substituted chlorinated
   phenol products were initially formed and consumed along with phenol
   thereafter mainly by polymerization mechanism. For 10 and 20 min of
   residence time phenol removal was 56\% and 78\%, respectively, with 450
   mg l(-1) phenol feed concentration and above 40 min of residence time
   all phenol was consumed within the column. For 1, 1.5, 2 and 3 h of
   residence time, phenol removal achieved was 42\%, 71\%, 81\% and 98\%,
   respectively, at 3100 mg l(-1) phenol feed concentration. It is
   noteworthy that more than 95\% of the initial phenol was converted into
   a non-passivating polymer without hazardous end products in a
   comparatively fast and energy-efficient process, being a safe treatment.

Abstract = {{This work examines the transient response of an anaerobic fluidized bed
   bioreactor to an overload of propylene glycol (PG), the primary
   component in aircraft de-icing waste. Under favorable operating
   conditions, PG was converted to n-propanol (n-PrOH) and propionate
   (HPr), and subsequently n-PrOH was completely converted into HPr. HPr
   was then fully degraded to methane and carbon dioxide via acetate. Under
   an overload condition, n-PrOH conversion to propionate was completely
   blocked but propionate degradation continued, contrary to free-energy
   computations in which n-PrOH should rapidly degrade and HPr should
   accumulate. When the imposed overload condition was relieved, the
   accumulated n-PrOH was rapidly converted into propionate. n-PrOH, then,
   could act as a temporal sink for reducing equivalents (XH2) and could
   regulate the overall PG methanazation process. n-PrOH should be
   monitored along with typical VFAs such as HPr to avoid sudden VFA
   accumulation and thus to optimize process performance for PG
   methanization. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbon cloth (ACC) was modified by the reaction between polar
   groups on its surface and metal alkoxides of titanium, silicon, aluminum
   and zirconium to enhance its capacitive deionization (CDI) performance.
   Incorporated state of metals and surface property of modified ACC were
   deduced from surface analysis results obtained using FE-SEM, XRD, XPS
   and zeta-potential meter. Titania was highly dispersed on the ACC
   surface with tetrahedral coordination, and the incorporated titania was
   effective to decrease physical adsorption of NaCl and to increase
   electric field adsorption, resulting in a significant enhancement of CDI
   performance. The negligible contribution of silica, alumina and zirconia
   modifications suggested that the small oxidation-reduction potential of
   titania was responsible for the enhancement of the electric field
   adsorption. Reversibility of adsorption and desorption operation on
   titania-modified ACC were also discussed relating to its CDI function.

Abstract = {{Modified peat was prepared by mixing thoroughly raw peat with sulfuric
   acid, and modified peat-resin particle was obtained, by mixing modified
   peat with solutions of polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and formaldehyde. In this
   paper, the adsorption of Basic Magenta and Basic Brilliant Green onto
   modified peat-resin particle is examined. The adsorption isotherm showed
   that the adsorption of basic dyes on modified peat-resin particle
   deviated from the Langmuir and Freundlich equations. The pseudo-first
   order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models were used
   to fit the experimental data. By comparing the standard deviation, it
   was found that the intraparticle diffusion model could be used to well
   describe the adsorption of two basic dyes on modified peat-resin
   particle. According to the change of intraparticle diffusion parameter,
   the adsorption processes could be divided into different stages. The
   kinetics experiment also indicated that initial dye concentrations,
   particle dose and particle size could affect the adsorption processes of
   basic dyes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mineral acids, such as H3PO4, H2SO4, HCl, and HNO3, were treated with
   magnesium-aluminum oxide (Mg-Al oxide), which behaved as a neutralizer
   and fixative of anions. Anion removal increased with increasing Mg-Al
   oxide quantity, time, Mg/Al molar ratio, and initial acid concentration.
   Up to 95\% removal of anions was achieved in 0.5 N acids using a
   stoichiometric quantity of Mg0.80Al0.20O1.10 for H3PO4, 1.75
   stoichiometric quantities for H2SO4, or 2.5 stoichiometric quantities
   for HCl or HNO3 at 20degreesC over a period of 6 h. The final solutions
   were found to have a pH in the range of 8-12. Selectivity of acid
   removal was found to follow the following order: H3PO4 > H2SO4 > HCl >
   HNO3. The equivalent of acid removal per 1 g of Mg-Al oxide decreased as
   the Mg/Al molar ratio of Mg-Al oxide increased. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Experiments carried out in a hollow-fiber, membrane-biofilm reactor
   (HFMBR) showed that the optimum pH for autotrophic denitrification was
   in the range 7.7-8.6, with the maximum efficiency at 8.4. Increasing the
   pH above 8.6 caused a significant decrease in nitrate removal rate and a
   dramatic increase in nitrite accumulation. The pH rose by 1.2 units when
   a large buffer was not added, suggesting that some field applications
   may require pH control. Precipitation of Ca2+ occurred in every
   experiment. Precipitation was the largest sink for carbonate, and it
   also offset alkalinity production by denitrification. Although the
   alkalinity increased in most cases, systems with a high carbonate buffer
   and high PH accentuated precipitation, and the net change in alkalinity
   was negative. The long-term success of field applications of the HFMBR
   may depend upon the interactions among calcium concentration, total
   carbonate concentration, pH, and alkalinity changes. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The disinfection efficacies of model organic chloramines were
   investigated. Twenty amino acids and two nucleic acid bases were
   chlorinated separately with sodium hypochlorite at a ON molar ratio of
   0.4:1, and were then used to treat an E. coli suspension for 60 min.
   DPD/FAS titration was carried out to obtain the concentration of the
   chlorinated nitrogenous organic compounds as a function of time. In
   addition, membrane introduction mass spectrometry (MIMS) was used to
   quantify inorganic chloramines (mono-, di-, and trichloramine).
   The results of these experiments showed that the organic chloramines
   examined in this research had little or no effect on the viability of E
   coli. MIMS analyses demonstrated that there was no quantifiable
   formation of inorganic chloramines when the organic nitrogen compounds
   were chlorinated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodegradation studies of organic compounds in the aquatic environment
   gain important information for the final fate of chemicals in the
   environment. A decisive role play tests for ready biodegradability (OECD
   301) and in this context, the respirometric test (OECD 301F). Two
   different respirometric systems (Oxitop(R) and Sapromat(R)) were
   compared and in two of ten cases (diethylene glycol and
   2-ethylhexylacrylate) differences were observed indicating that the test
   systems are not always equivalent. For 2-ethylhexylacrylate and
   cyclohexanone we could not state differences in the extent of
   biodegradation with a municipal and industrial inoculum, whereas for
   cyclohexanone the degradation rate was faster with a municipal inoculum.
   Allylthiourea (ATU) proved to be an effective inhibitor of nitrification
   processes and did not affect the heterotrophic biodegradation activity.
   Modelling of biodegradation processes could be successfully performed
   with a first-order and a modified logistic plot. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The different use of P-resources between two sites in the deep
   oligotrophic Traunsee was studied by seasonal and vertical patterns of
   phytoplankton and nutrients from 12/1997 to 10/1998. The P-resources
   were evaluated from the proportion between the P-fractions, the
   dissolved reactive P (DRP), dissolved non-reactive P (DOP) and
   particulate organic P (PP) and from the stoichiometry between nutrients,
   the total N (TN), the total P (TP) and soluble reactive Si (SRSi).
   Significant differences between an inshore site impacted by industrial
   tailings (Ebensee Bay, EB) and an open water reference site (Viechtau,
   VI) were evident from vertical profiles of both the P-accumulation (\%PP
   of TP) evaluated by DRP:DOP:PP and the distribution of phytoplankton
   assessed by Si-exhaustion (TN:TP:SRSi), but not from the seasonal
   patterns of phytoplankton composition, S:V ratios of the algal community
   or surface layer nutrient dynamics. Low TP and the stable stratification
   from May to September triggered the relative accumulation of epilimnetic
   P at VI as it was evident from both the higher portion of particulate P
   within TP (\%PP of TP) and from tile shift towards P-enrichment in
   nutrient stoichiometry of TN:TP:SRSi. The predominance of around 55-52\%
   algal carbon over bacteria at the surface layer to 20 m coincided
   spatially with the lowest Si content relative to N and P. The
   disturbances at the impacted site was summarised by: up to 11\% less P
   accumulation by organisms at the surface, no stoichiometric shift
   towards TP in the epilimnion when compared with deeper layers and a
   reduction of the trophogenic zone to the top 10 m. Reasons for this
   disturbance are seen in the unstable stratification, turbidity, higher
   TP and the metazoan dominated food chain. Both triple ratios, DRP:DOP:PP
   and TN:TP:SRSi, were sensitive indicators of the use of P-resources by
   plankton communities, while inorganic dissolved fractions (DIN:DRP:SRSi,
   DIN dissolved inorganic N) provided only insufficient information on
   nutrient resources in Traunsee. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas oryzihabitans is an uncommon pathogen that may cause

   the environment, the source of human infection has not been well
   documented. In this study, we describe the presence of P. oryzihabitans
   adhering on suspended particulate matters recovered from karst
   groundwaters. The isolated pathogen was capable of forming biofilms on
   silicon supports and clay beads. Adherent P. oryzihabitans cells
   displayed a high resistance to chlorine as compared with the same
   organisms cultured in the planktonic mode. These results demonstrate
   that aquifer biofilms are potential environmental sources for water-born
   P. oryzihabitans infections and that bacterial attachment might affect
   drinking water purification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The wastewater produced by the cochincal extract process to obtain the
   carminic acid colouring pigment (carmin red E120) has high
   concentrations of phosphates and ammonium. It is known that both ions
   can be precipitated with magnesium in the form of struvite, MgNH4PO4, or
   ammonium magnesium phosphate (MAP) compounds. In this study, the use of
   an alternative MgO-containing by-product is investigated. The optimal
   pH, reaction time and solid/liquid ratio have been studied. It has been
   found that the low-grade MgO needed is greater than the stoichiometric
   value for the full removal of ammonium and phosphate as MAP compounds.
   Although the low-grade MgO (LG-MgO) reacts slower than pure MgO, it has
   considerable economic advantages. A batch process has been proposed for
   the removal of ammonium and phosphates from wastewater obtained in
   cochineal extracts processing, previously to biological treatment to
   diminish the COD. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of how to capture the complex
   relationships that exist between process variables and to diagnose the
   dynamic behaviour of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WTP). Due
   to the complex biological reaction mechanisms, the highly time-varying,
   and multivariable aspects of the real WTP, the diagnosis of the WTP are
   still difficult in practice. The application of intelligent techniques,
   which can analyse the multi-dimensional process data using a
   sophisticated visualisation technique, can be useful for analysing and
   diagnosing the activated-sludge WTP.
   In this paper, the Kohonen Self-Organising Feature Maps (KSOFM) neural
   network is applied to analyse the multidimensional process data, and to
   diagnose the inter-relationship of the process variables in a real
   activated-sludge WTP. By using component planes, some detailed local
   relationships between the process variables, e.g., responses of the
   process variables under different operating conditions, as well as the
   global information is discovered. The operating condition and the
   inter-relationship among the process variables in the WTP have been
   diagnosed and extracted by the information obtained from the clustering
   analysis of the maps.
   It is concluded that the KSOFM technique provides an effective analysing
   and diagnosing tool to understand the system behaviour and to extract
   knowledge contained in multi-dimensional data of a large-scale WTP. (C)

Abstract = {{Clays (especially montmorillonite and bentonite) are widely used as
   barriers in landfills to prevent contamination of subsoil and
   groundwater by leachates containing heavy metals. For this reason it is
   important to study the adsorption of metals by these clays. The sorption
   of seven metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn) on Na-montmorillonite
   was studied as a function of pH and in the presence of ligands, forming
   complexes of different stabilities with the metals of interest. The
   continuous column method was used as it better simulates natural
   conditions. The total capacity of Na-montmorillonite towards these
   metals was determined. The pH variations influence to a higher extent
   the concentrations of Cu, Pb and Cd in the effluent. Moreover the
   results suggest that complex formation hinders the sorption of the
   metals on the clay, with an increasing influence in the order: Mn less
   than or equal to Pb less than or equal to Cd less than or equal to Zn <
   Ni < Cu < Cr. The evaluation of the total capacity of Na-montmorillonite
   shows that this clay is a good sorbent towards all examined metals. (C)

Abstract = {{The performance of temperature-phased anaerobic digestion (TPAD) system
   in the stabilization of dairy cattle wastes at high solids
   concentrations has never been evaluated, though the process has been
   established as a feasible alternative to conventional mesophilic
   processes for the treatment of municipal wastewater sludges. In this
   study, the TPAD system operating at a retention time of 14 days was
   subjected to varying total solids (TS) concentrations (3.46-14.54\%) of
   dairy cattle wastes. At TS concentrations lower than 12.20\%,
   corresponding to system volatile solids (VS) loadings in the range of
   1.87-5.82 g VS/L/day, the system achieved an average VS removal of
   40.2\%. The maximum VS destruction of 42.6\% was achieved at a TS
   concentration of 10.35\%. Methane recovery from the wastes was
   consistently within 0.21-0.22 L/g VS fed. There was a drop in the system
   performance with respect to VS removal and methane recovery at TS
   concentrations higher than 10.35\%. volatile fatty acid/alkalinity
   ratios less than 0.35 in the thermophilic reactor and 0.10 in the
   mesophilic reactor were found favorable for stable operation of the
   system. For the entire range of TS concentrations, the indicator
   organism counts in the biosolids were within the limits specified by
   USEPA in 40 CFR Part 503 regulations for Class A designation. After
   digestion, nearly 80-85\% of total phosphorus was associated with the

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{In July 1999, California's ocean recreational bacterial water quality
   standards were changed from a total coliform (TC) test to a standard
   requiring testing for all three bacterial indicators: TC, fecal
   coliforms (FC), and enterococci (EC). To compare the relationship
   between the bacterial indicators, and the effect that changing the
   standards would have on recreational water regulatory actions, three
   regional studies were conducted along the southern California shoreline
   from Santa Barbara to San Diego, California. Two studies were conducted
   during dry weather and one following a large storm event. In each study,
   samples were collected at over 200 sites which were selected using a
   stratified random design, with strata consisting of open beach areas and
   rocky shoreline, and areas near freshwater outlets that drain land-based
   runoff. During the dry weather studies, samples were collected once per
   week for 5 weeks. For the storm event study, sampling occurred on a
   single day about 24h following the storm. The three indicator bacteria
   were measured at each site and the results were compared to the single
   sample standards (TC > 10,000; FC > 400 and EC > 104MPN or cfu/100ml).
   EC was the indicator that failed the single sample standards most often.
   During the wet weather study, 99\% of all standard failures were
   detected using EC, compared with only 56\% for FC, and 40\% for TC.
   During the Summer Study, EC was again the indicator that failed the
   single sample standards most often, with 60\% of the failures for EC
   alone. The increased failure of the EC standard occurred consistently
   regardless of whether the sample was collected at a beach or rocky
   shoreline site, or at a site near a freshwater outlet. Agreement among
   indicators was better during wet weather than during dry weather. During
   dry weather, agreement among indicators was better near freshwater
   outlets than along open shoreline. Cumulatively, our results suggest
   that replacement of a TC standard with an EC standard will lead to a
   five-fold increase in failures during dry weather and a doubling of
   failures during wet weather. Replacing a TC standard with one based on
   all three indicators will lead to an eight-fold increase in failures.
   Changes in the requirements for water quality testing have strong
   implications for increases in beach closures and restrictions. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Non-equilibrium sorption-desorption behavior of atrazine was studied on
   two surface soils. Impact of sorption contact time was evaluated by
   interpreting temporal variations in Freundlich sorption isotherm
   parameters n(t) and K-F(t) obtained from the phase distribution
   relationships. The extent of sorption linearity was very similar (n
   similar to 0.90) for the two soils at all sorption contact times. K-F(t)
   increased with contact time and stabilized upon reaching apparent
   equilibrium. K-F for woodland soil was significantly higher than that
   for agricultural soil. The Apparent Hysteresis Index (AHI) parameter was
   used to quantify sorption-desorption hysteresis arising from
   non-equilibrium sorption. AHI was a function of the sorption contact
   time and correlated well with KF(t). The woodland soil sorbed more
   herbicide due to its higher organic matter content. However, a larger
   fraction of the herbicide sorbed to this soil was released rapidly
   (within 24 h) following sorptive uptake. The differences in
   sorption-desorption behavior of atrazine in the two soils appear to be
   related to variations in the type and location of organic matter in the
   two soils. The parameters K-F(t) and AHI(t) consistently demonstrated
   the effects that arise when batch systems are not brought to equilibrium
   during sorption studies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In aquatic toxicity testing, no single test species is sensitive to all
   toxicants. Therefore, test batteries consisting of several individual
   assays are becoming more common. The organisms in a test battery should
   be representative of the entire system of interest. The results of the
   assays should be complementary to other components in the test battery
   to avoid redundancy. With the aid of multidimensional scaling (MDS), a
   multivariate statistical method, we examined the toxicity data of five
   bioassays (the continuous Shk1, Polytox(R), activated sludge respiration
   inhibition, Nitrosomonas, and Tetrahymena assays) that could serve as
   test battery components for the assessment of wastewater toxicity to
   activated sludge. MDS mapped the five assays into a two-dimensional
   space and showed that the Nitrosomonas assay should be included in test
   batteries plus one of the remaining four assays for assessing wastewater
   toxicity to activated sludge. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Selective extraction techniques were used to assay the importance of
   specific solid phases in Pb binding by heterogeneous surface coating
   materials (biofilms) in Cayuga Lake, NY. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride
   (NH2OH . HCl) was used to extract easily reducible Mn oxides, and sodium
   dithionite (Na2S2O4) was used to extract Mn and Fe oxides in two sets of
   biofilm samples retrieved from the lake. Pb remaining after extraction
   was removed by extraction with 10\% HNO3, determined by analysis of
   Pb-208 using a sector field mass spectrometer with an inductively
   coupled plasma ion source (ICP-MS), and compared to the total
   extractable Pb. The results indicate that the greatest contribution to
   total Pb binding to the heterogeneous surface coating materials was from
   Mn oxides. Pb adsorption capacity of Mn oxides exceeded that of Fe
   oxides on a molar basis by approximately an order of magnitude. The high
   reactivity observed for natural Mn oxides indicates that they are
   biogenic in origin, consistent with expectations based on the relative
   biotic and abiotic rates of Mn(H) oxidation under circumneutral
   conditions. Collectively, these results confirm expectations based on
   prior observations of adsorption of added Pb by Cayuga Lake biofilms
   before and after selective extraction, and also confirm predictions for
   Pb phase association in the lake based on the behavior of laboratory
   surrogates for adsorptive surfaces. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Disinfection of some microorganisms is characterized by a lag-phase (a
   minimum required ozone exposure until disinfection occurs). This
   phenomenon is easy to model in laboratory batch reactors but not in
   continuous flow mixed reactors. This paper introduces a stochastic
   disinfection model where individual microorganisms are followed on their
   paths through full-scale reactors. Combining exponentially distributed
   transport processes with delayed exponential disinfection kinetics for
   large populations of microorganisms (up to 10,000 individuals) yields
   predictions which can be evaluated statistically. It could be shown that
   deterministic models work well for systems with good disinfection
   performance (more than 2 log units reduction of active microorganisms),
   for reactors with poor performance stochastic models have to be applied.
   It could be demonstrated for real reactors that Bacillus subtilis spores
   are poor surrogates for Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts. The differences
   between the two microorganisms are large for reactors that deviate
   significantly from plug-flow behaviour. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The adsorption capacity of some natural materials for lead such as
   animal bone powder, active carbon, Nile rose plant powder, commercial
   carbon and ceramics was studied. The V/m ratio has been chosen to be
   500ml/g. The adsorption process was affected by various parameters such
   as contact time, pH and concentration of lead solution. The lead uptake
   percent reaches equilibrium state after 15, 30, 45 and 120 min for bone
   powder, active carbon, plant powder and commercial carbon, respectively.
   The uptake percent of lead increased by increasing pH value. The
   sequence of lead uptake percent (\% adsorption) at constant pH from
   certain concentration of lead nitrate solution by the different natural
   materials is in the order: bone powder > active carbon > plant powder >
   commercial carbon. The uptake percent of lead is increased by decreasing
   the concentration of lead at constant pH The capacity of lead adsorbed
   from nitrate solution by the different natural materials increased by
   increasing pH value. The synthetic and industrial waste-water samples
   were treated by using the different natural materials (contact time 3
   It, pH = 4). The percent removal of lead was 100\% by bone powder, 90\%
   by active carbon, 80\% by plant powder and 50\% by commercial carbon.
   There was no removal of lead by ceramics. This may be due to the
   presence of high percent of lead in the constituent of ceramics (372

Abstract = {{The aim of the study is the evaluation of resistance patterns of E. coli
   in wastewater treatment plants without an evaluation of basic antibiotic
   resistance mechanisms.
   Investigations have been done in sewage, sludge and receiving waters
   from three different sewage treatment plants in southern Austria. A
   total of 767 E coli isolates were tested regarding their resistance to
   24 different antibiotics. The highest resistance rates were found in E
   coli strains of a sewage treatment plant which treats not only municipal
   sewage but also sewage from a hospital.
   Among the antimicrobial agents tested, the highest resistance rates in
   the penicillin group were found for Ampicillin (AM) (up to 18\%) and
   Piperacillin (PIP) (up to 12\%); in the cephalosporin group for
   Cefalothin (CF) (up to 35\%) and Cefuroxime-Axetil (CXMAX) (up to 11\%);
   in the group of quinolones for Nalidixic acid (NA) (up to 15\%); and for
   Trimethoprime/Sulfamethoxazole (SXT) (up to 13\%) and for Tetracycline
   (TE) (57\%).
   Median values for E. coli in the inflow (crude sewage) of the plants
   were between 2.0 x 10(4) and 6.1 x 10(4) CFU/ml (Coli ID-agar,
   BioMerieux 42017) but showed a 200-fold reduction in all three plants in
   the effluent. Nevertheless, more than 10(2) CFU E. coli/ml reached the
   receiving water and thus sewage treatment processes contribute to the
   dissemination of resistant bacteria in the environment. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In order to identify the cause of toxicity in sediments and suspended
   matter, a large number of samples with different degrees of
   contamination was taken at various locations in The Netherlands.
   Standard acute bioassays were carried out with the bacterium Vibrio
   fischeri, the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and the anostracan
   Thamnocephalus platyurus. Chronic standard tests were performed using
   the water flea Daphnia magna and larvae of the midge Chironomus
   riparius. Some novel bioassays were performed as well. Most toxic
   effects observed in standard bioassays with sediments from polluted
   sediments (class 3 and 4 on a scale of 0-4 according to the Dutch
   criteria) could be partly explained by toxic concentrations of known
   persistent priority pollutants, mainly heavy metals and occasionally
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In some of the samples, ammonia
   toxicity was a confounding factor during testing. Suspended matter from
   the Meuse river at Eijsden, which may be considered as `new' sediment
   (pollution class 2), was moderately to highly toxic in almost all
   bioassays. This could have been associated with a combination of heavy
   metals, PAHs and ammonia. At two locations from the Lake IJssel area
   with no apparent persistent pollution, moderate and strong effects were
   nonetheless observed in invertebrate tests. This might have been due to
   agricultural run-off of pesticides, which are not routinely measured in
   sediments. A few effects on V. fischeri in canals and a small stream
   could not be explained with standard chemical analysis, but seemed
   associated with the outlets of sewage water treatment plants and
   industrial effluents. Additional chemical analysis of pore water samples
   from five selected sediments yielded more identified substances such as
   phtalates, decanes, cosanes and fragrances, but it wash estimated that
   their contribution to the effects observed on V. fischeri, D. magna and
   C. riparius was negligible. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Consequences of short-term changes in thermotolerant coliform loads on
   their spatio-temporal distribution in a Mediterranean lagoon with
   large-scale mollusk farming (Than lagoon, France) were explored using a
   simulation approach. Simulations were based on bacterial transport and
   survival coupled models forced by the input of bacterial loads from the
   two main rivers (Vene and Pallas) that flow into the lagoon. Different
   flow types (reference, sudden and constant), bringing the same bacterial
   load, were considered and subsequent spatial and temporal bacterial
   contamination of lagoon surface water and shellfish was estimated.
   Simulation results showed that as long as loads were high,
   hydrodynamical processes governed the distribution of bacterial
   abundance in receiving areas. As soon as loads decreased or when time
   supply increased, biological die-off processes became dominant.
   Bacterial contamination of shellfish induced by the different flow types
   appeared to depend on the receiving area. In the case of Pallas River
   area, a sudden input of bacteria led to a high bacterial contamination
   of shellfish but only during a short period (approximate to1 day). A
   constant input of the same amount of bacteria induced a lower but
   significant contamination during all the simulation period (10 days). On
   the contrary, bacterial inputs from the Vene River led to shellfish
   contamination only when bacteria were delivered through a flood event.
   Exposure time of bacteria to adverse environmental conditions appeared
   to be the main explanation to the above-mentioned differences.
   Consequences of our results in terms of environmental management
   strategy were discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The scope of this study was the removal of ammonium by ion exchange from
   simulated wastewater. The study looks at the effect of organics upon
   ammonium ion exchange equilibrium uptake. The ion exchangers included a
   natural zeolite clinoptilolite, and two polymeric exchangers, Dowex
   50w-x8, and Purolite MN500. The organic compounds studied included
   citric acid and a number of proteins. The traditional method for removal
   of ammonium and organic pollutants from wastewater is biological
   treatment, but ion exchange offers,a number of advantages including the
   ability to handle shock loadings and the ability to operate over a wider
   range of temperatures. The results show that in most of the cases
   studied, the presence of organic compounds enhances the uptake of
   ammonium ion onto the ion exchangers. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Biodegradation rates of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in
   spilled oil stranded on tidal flats were evaluated using model reactors
   to clarify the effects of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) on the
   biodegradation of PAHs in stranded oil on tidal flat with special
   emphasis on the relationship between dissolution rates of PAHs into
   water and viscosity of NAPL. Biodegradation of PAHs in NAPL was limited
   by the dissolution rates of PAHs into water. Biodegradation rate of
   chrysene was smaller than that of acenaphtene and phenanthrene due to
   the smaller dissolution rates. Dissolution rates of PAHs in fuel oil C
   were smaller than those in crude oil due to high viscosity of fuel oil
   C. Hence, biodegradation rates of PAHs in fuel oil C were smaller than
   those in crude oil. Biodegradation rates of PAHs in NAPL with slow rate
   of decrease like fuel oil C was slower than those in NAPL with rapid
   rate of decrease like crude oil. The smaller rate of decrease of fuel
   oil C than crude oil was due to the higher viscosity of fuel oil C.
   Therefore, not only the dissolution rate of PAHs but also the rates of
   decrease of NAPL were important factors for the biodegradation of PAHs.

Abstract = {{Climate, flow rate and land use are all known drivers of water quality
   in river systems, but determining the relative influences of these
   factors remains a significant challenge for aquatic science and
   management. Long-term data from the Schuylkill River at Philadelphia is
   assessed here in an attempt to ascertain the separate and combined
   influence of these major drivers on water quality in a developed
   watershed. Water quality measures including nutrients, conservative
   solutes and bacteria all elicited distinct seasonal patterns driven
   primarily by river discharge. Mass transport rates of sodium and
   chloride have increased with time, and were elevated in winter.,
   presumably as a function of road salt deposition. A steady increase in
   developed land area in the watershed has occurred in recent decades,
   which allowed the use of time as a surrogate parameter for regional
   development in the construction of multiple factor linear models
   predicting the relative influences of precipitation, river discharge and
   developed land area on river water quality. Linear models predicting
   annually averaged water quality measures showed the effects of
   precipitation, discharge and developed land area to be of nearly equal
   importance in regulating levels of conductivity, alkalinity, sodium, and
   chloride in the river. Models predicting water quality variables for
   discrete samples demonstrated that river flow was the major determinant
   of daily variability in alkalinity, conductivity, hardness and calcium
   levels, while still resolving the highly significant influence of
   watershed development on water quality. Increases in solute transport in
   the Schuylkill River in recent decades appear to be the direct result of
   modern suburban development in the watershed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A counterpropagation neural network (CPN) was applied to predict species
   richness (SR) and Shannon diversity index (SH) of benthic
   macroinvertebrate communities using 34 environmental variables. The data
   were collected at 664 sites at 23 different water types such as springs,
   streams, rivers, canals, ditches, lakes, and pools in The Netherlands.
   By training the CPN, the sampling sites were classified into five groups
   and the classification was mainly related to pollution status and
   habitat type of the sampling sites. By visualizing environmental
   variables and diversity indices on the map of the trained model, the
   relationships between variables were evaluated. The trained CPN serves
   as a `look-up table' for finding the corresponding values between
   environmental variables and community indices. The output of the model
   fitted SH and SR well showing a high accuracy of the prediction (r >
   0.90 and 0.67 for learning and testing process, respectively) for both
   SH and SR. Finally, the results of this study, which uses the capability
   of the CPN for patterning and predicting ecological data, suggest that
   the CPN can be effectively used as a tool for assessing ecological
   status and predicting water quality of target ecosystems. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Steady-state mass balance models have been successfully used to predict
   annual loads and concentrations of numerous substances in lakes. A major
   limitation of the model is that the value of the mass transfer
   coefficient, v(X), for some substance, X, is assumed constant and is
   taken as a mean value of a set of calibration lakes. The range in mean
   values between lakes for v(X) is typically two- to three-fold. Thus,
   there is some potential for error in model predictions if the true but
   unknown value for a given lake differs from the mean, calibration value.
   Moreover, the use of a region-specific value for v(X) for all lakes in a
   region means that when environmental conditions change, the model will
   have to be re-calibrated requiring many more years of monitoring. In
   this study, mass balances for two substances, total iron and aluminum,
   are presented along with simple empirical relationships that predict
   mass transfer coefficients for iron as a function of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) concentration and aluminum as a function of DOC and pH. The
   relationships, which are consistent with current understanding of iron
   and aluminum behavior, account for >90\% of the variation in v(X).
   Improvements in mass balance model predictions are expected when these
   coefficients are used in place of constant values. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The construction and electrochemical response characteristics of poly
   (vinyl chloride) matrix membrane sensors for seven phenolic compounds
   (phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol, p-chlorophenol, o-nitrophenol,
   alpha-naphthol and beta-naphthol) are described.
   The membranes incorporate ion association complexes of these seven
   phenolic anions with phenanthroline-iron(II) as electroactive materials.
   These sensors show linear response for phenol, o-cresol, p-cresol,
   p-chlorophenol, o-nitrophenol, alpha-naphthol, and beta-naphthol over
   wide concentration ranges, with an average anionic slope 54.3 mV per
   concentration decade.
   The suggested sensors exhibit fast response time (1 min), low
   determination limits (1 x 10(-5) M), good stability (2-3 weeks),
   reasonable selectivity to phenolic compounds in the presence of other
   water pollutants. The average percentage recovery was 99.78+/-0.088 for
   individual phenolates and 99.61+/-0.198 for phenolates in mixtures.
   The investigated sensors were successfully used for direct
   potentiometric determination of traces of these phenolic compounds in
   wastewater samples. Results with mean accuracy of 99.74 +/- 0.29\%,
   99.82+/-0.36\%, 99.65+/-0.47\%, 99.73+/-0.37\%, 99.77+/-0.30\%,
   99.86+/-0.31\% and 99.91+/-0.22\% was obtained for the seven sensors,
   respectively.
   These results were compared with data obtained using the British
   pharamacopial method (The British Pharmacopoeia, Her Majesty's
   Stationary Office, London, 1993) and others (Clarke's Isolation and
   Identification of Drugs in Pharmaceuticals Body Fluids and Post-mortem

Abstract = {{The interaction of oxovanadium(IV) (VO2+) in aqueous solution with
   commercial calcium hydroxyapatite (CAP) has been studied. VO2+ ions are
   adsorbed on the surface of CAP by coordination to OH groups, without
   modification of the crystalline lattice. The extent of the adsorption is
   followed by chemical analysis, ESR and IR spectroscopy. Results are
   compared with those obtained for VO2+/synthetic calcium hydroxyapatite
   (HAP), reported by us in previous works. The uptake is better than the
   observed for HAP. The maximum adsorption is observed at pH 3.5 and 288
   K. We conclude that VO2+ is indeed adsorbed on CAP and the extent of
   adsorption depends on the pH and temperature. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Suspended particulate matter (SPM) was collected seasonally for 1 yr at
   third- and fifth-order sites in a blackwater stream on the coastal plain
   in South Carolina. Fatty acids with carbon chain lengths from C-12-C-32
   were the most abundant component among the lipid classes examined with
   total concentrations varying from 8.5 to 60.2 mug L-1. Unsaturated fatty
   acids predominated while significant concentrations of the even-chained
   saturated components C-24-C-30 derived from cuticular plant waxes were
   also found. Concentrations of aliphatic alcohols, with carbon chain
   lengths between C-16 and C-30, ranged from 0.52 to 2.73 mug L-1 and was
   dominated by the higher molecular weight compounds (C-22-C-30) derived
   primarily from cuticular plant waxes. Total hydrocarbon concentrations
   ranged from 0.35 to 5.66 mug L-1 and showed no discernible trends with
   time or consistent difference between sites. The hydrocarbon assemblage
   observed indicates that these components are entirely of biogenic origin
   with no detectable anthropogenic contribution.
   The ratios of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids and cuticular to
   noncuticular fatty acids and alcohols at both stream locations indicate
   that the organic detritus associated with SPM collected during November
   and January is of more recent origin and less processed than that
   collected in the spring and summer months. Lipid concentrations at the
   third-order site generally had higher and more variable concentrations
   of the lipid classes compared with the fifth-order site. The ratio of
   saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was higher at the third-order site
   indicating that the organic fraction of SPM at this site was of more
   recent origin and less decomposed. The ratios of cuticular to
   noncuticular fatty acids and alcohols support this conclusion. These
   results indicate an export of particulate lipids of higher carbon
   resource quality from upstream to lower stream reaches. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Bio-augmentation can be used to obtain nitrification in activated sludge
   processes that operate at sub-optimal solid retention times. in this
   study, we evaluated the potential of augmenting the endogenous
   nitrifying bacteria, by implementing a nitrification reactor in the
   sludge return line. This reactor can be fed with an internal N-rich flow
   (e.g. effluent from the sludge treatment) or with an external ammonium
   source. A mathematical model based on ASM1 was developed and used to
   evaluate the potential of this technique. The bio-augmentation studied
   here aimed to enhance the nitrification process of highly loaded
   activated sludge systems. A calibrated simulation model of a high loaded
   wastewater treatment plant in The Netherlands was used for this study. A
   side stream process (the named BABE process) was included in the
   simulation. This process was fed with the ammonia-rich water generated
   by sludge digestion and subsequent thickening by centrifugation (the
   so-called rejectwater). An external source (artificial) of ammonium was
   also considered to evaluate the differences between the two origins of
   ammonium. The results showed that with the augmentation process, high
   loaded activated sludge systems can achieve nitrification even at low
   winter temperatures. The best effect is obtained for systems operating
   at approximately 50\% of the minimal SRT without augmentation. The use
   of an internal ammonia source is more effective than an external source.
   The results of this study give a quantitative basis for the design of
   process internal bio-augmentation processes and the effect on the
   N-removal capacity of the treatment plant. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Effect of temperature and disinfection strategies on ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria in a bench-scale drinking water distribution system}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{1805-1817}},

Abstract = {{The establishment of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), a group of
   autotrophic microorganisms responsible for nitrification in
   chloraminated distribution systems, was studied in a bench-scale
   distribution system. The potential significance of temperature and
   disinfectant residual associated with chloramination in full-scale
   drinking water distribution systems was assessed. Biofilm development
   was primarily monitored using AOB abundance and nitrite concentrations.
   The bench-scale system was initially operated under typical North
   American summer (22degreesC) and fall (12degreesC) temperatures,
   representing optimal and less optimal growth ranges for these
   microorganisms. Additional experimentation investigated AOB
   establishment at a suboptimal winter distribution system temperature of
   6degreesC. The effect of chloramine residual on AOB establishment was
   studied at higher (0.2-0.6 mg/L) and lower (0.6-0.1 mg/L) ranges, using
   a 3:1 (w/w) chlorine: ammonia dosing ratio. Conditions were selected to
   represent those typically found in a North American distribution system,
   in areas of low flow and longer retention times, respectively. Finally,
   the effect of a free chlorine residual on an established nitrifying
   biofilm was briefly examined. Results clearly indicate that AOB
   development occurs at all examined temperatures, as well as at selected
   monochloramine residuals. The maintenance of a disinfectant residual was
   difficult at times, but was more inhibitory to the nitrifying biofilm
   than the lower temperature. It can be concluded from the data that
   nitrification may not be adequately inhibited during the winter months,
   which may result in more advanced stages of nitrification the following
   season. Free chlorination can be effective in controlling AOB activity
   in the short term, but may not prevent reestablishment of a nitrifying
   biofilm upon return to chloramination. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Nitrate removal by laboratory and field continuous-flow zero-valent iron
   (Fe-0) packed bed columns was evaluated for different influent water
   qualities (pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), nitrate concentration) and several
   months of operation (600-1500 bed volumes (BVs)). In contrast to
   previous batch experiments with Fe-0 where nitrate was
   stoichiometrically converted to ammonium, only 70\% of the applied
   nitrogen was recovered as nitrate, ammonium, or nitrite (<0.1 mg/L)
   during shorter-term column tests (2-20BVs) and less than 25\% of the
   applied nitrogen was recovered during longer-term field testing
   (500-1000 BVs) at elevated nitrate levels (similar to25 mg N/L). Nitrate
   removal was accompanied by a pH increase, DO decrease, and soluble iron
   increase. During longer-term operation (500-1500 BVs) iron and calcium
   precipitates were observed, by SEM and EDX analyses, to form in the
   packed columns. Precipitation led to cementation and reduction in
   permeability for the Fe-0/sand media in the packed column. Different
   abiotic and microbial-mediated mechanisms may be involved during
   shorter- and longer-term operation of Fe 0 systems and the role of iron
   precipitates should be further evaluated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this paper a strategy is proposed to reduce the complexity of the
   activated sludge model no. 1 (ASM1) which describes the
   biotransformation processes in a common activated sludge process with
   N-removal. The key feature of the obtained reduced model is that it
   combines high predictive value (all state variables keep their
   biological interpretation) with very low computation time. Therefore,
   this model is a valuable tool in a risk assessment environment (designed
   for the evaluation of wastewater treatment plants facing stricter
   effluent norms) as well as in on-line (MPC) control strategies. The
   complexity reduction procedure consists of four steps. In the first step
   representative input/output data sets are generated by simulating the
   full ASM1 model. In the second step the ASM1 model is rewritten in state
   space format with linear approximations of the nonlinear (kinetic)
   terms. In the third step the unknown parameters in the linear terms are
   identified based on the generated input/output data. To reduce the
   amount of parameter sets that have to be identified (to cover the full
   operation range of the plant), a Multi-Model interpolation procedure is
   introduced as a last step. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ground water contaminated with trichloroethylene (TCE) used in
   electronic, electric, dry cleaning and the like industries is often
   treated by air-stripping. In this treatment process, TCE in its vapor
   form is stripped from ground water by air stream and sometimes emitted
   into the atmosphere without any additional treatments. Activated carbon
   adsorption is one of the practical and useful processes for recovering
   the TCE vapor from the exhaust air stream. However, adsorption of the
   TCE vapor from the stripping air stream onto activated carbons is not so
   simple as that from dry air, since in the exhaust air stream the TCE
   vapor coexists with water vapor with relatively high concentrations. The
   understanding of the adsorption characteristics of the TCE vapor to be
   adsorbed on activated carbon in the water vapor-coexisting system is
   essential for successfully designing and operating the TCE recovery
   process. In this work, the adsorption equilibrium relations of the TCE
   vapor adsorption on activated carbons were elucidated as a function of
   various relative humidity. Activated carbon fibers (ACFs) were used as
   model activated carbon. The adsorption equilibrium relations were
   studied by the column adsorption method. The adsorption isotherms of TCE
   vapor adsorbed on sample ACFs were successfully correlated by the
   Dubinin-Radushkevich equation for both cases with and without coexistent
   water vapor. No effects of coexistent water vapor were found on the
   limiting adsorption volume. However, the adsorption characteristic
   energy was significantly reduced by the coexistence of water vapor and
   its reduction was successfully correlated with the equilibrium amount of
   water vapor adsorbed under the dynamic condition. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The majority of pollution generated from leather manufacturing can be
   contributed to the inefficiency of chemical use in leather processing
   and to organic substances derived from the hides during processing. In
   particular, the overall tanning processes performed in drums can be
   characterized by a high consumption of water and chemicals, most of
   which are found in the final wastewater. To ensure full penetration and
   reaction of chemicals with collagen, chemicals are added in excess and
   are only partly up-taken by the leather. Significant savings of
   chemicals can be achieved by recovery and recycling of chemicals and
   water from part streams, thus reducing environmental impacts.
   This research formed an integrated approach to investigate and exploit
   the potential of a closed loop operation for various part streams of
   tanneries. Each of the process streams was separately collected, treated
   and purified by membrane technologies to obtain a recyclable liquor
   which can be re-used operationally. In this way a complete recovery of
   process liquors can be achieved for immediate operational re-use.
   Membrane technology has been applied to recover chemicals from
   un-hairing, vegetable tanning, chrome liquors and to polish saline part
   streams for re-use. By applying membrane filtration up to 90\% of the
   treated liquors can be recovered giving a remaining concentrate volume
   of only 10\%. The permeate obtained from several process areas contained
   to a high extent chemicals, which were re-used for leather processing.

Abstract = {{Anaerobic treatability of a real cotton textile wastewater was
   investigated in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) with pumice as the support
   material. The immobilized biomass or attached volatile solids level on
   the support material was 0.073 g VSS/g support material at the end of
   the 128-d start-up period. During the operation period, real cotton
   textile wastewater was fed to the anaerobic FBR both unsupplemented (in
   Stages I and 2) and supplemented (with synthetic municipal wastewater in
   Stage 3 and glucose in Stages 4-6). The effect of operational conditions
   such as organic loading rate (OLR), hydraulic retention time (HRT),
   influent glucose concentration as the co-substrate, etc. was
   investigated to achieve the maximum color removal efficiency in the
   reactor. Results indicated that anaerobic treatment of textile
   wastewater studied was possible with the supplementation of an external
   carbon source in the form of glucose (about 2 g/l). The corresponding
   maximum COD, BOD5 and color removals were found to be around 82\%, 94\%
   and 59\%, respectively, for HRT of around 24 It and OLR of 3 kg
   COD/m(3)/d. Further increase in external carbon source added to real
   textile wastewater did not improve the color removal efficiency of the

Abstract = {{Three types of commercially available humic acids from different sources
   were used to simulate natural organic matter in water for the
   investigation of nitrobenzene oxidation by ozonation and O-3/UV. Despite
   the structural differences among the Fluka, Aldrich and Suwanee River
   humic acids as reflected by the UV absorptivity, their effects on
   nitrobenzene removal rate was observed to be similar for the two
   processes. Removal rate of nitrobenzene was hindered by the addition of
   humic acids in ozonation as well as in O-3/UV processes. However, the
   hindrance by the humic acids was more pronounced in O-3/UV as compared
   to the ozonation process. The effect of humic acid in O-3/UV was
   primarily a UV light screening. Addition of humic acids above a certain
   concentration did not cause any further retardation on nitrobenzene
   removal rate by ozonation and O-3/UV.
   Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide as well as probable formation of
   peroxy radicals in the solutions might induce chain promoting reactions
   to produce hydroxyl radical during the nitrobenzene oxidation. For
   waters containing high levels of humic acid, ozonation alone might be as
   effective as 03/UV process for the removal of nitrobenzene. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The primary location of oxygen transfer in a diffused aeration system is
   examined by separately determining the surface air-water and
   bubble-water mass transfer coefficients. The mass transfer model
   developed to determine the mass transfer coefficients advances the
   McWhirter and Hutter (A.I.Ch.E. J. 35(9) (1989) 1527) model by tracking
   oxygen and nitrogen transfer into and out of the bubbles as they rise to
   the water surface. The resulting vertical profiles of the liquid-phase
   equilibrium concentration inside the bubble and the gas-phase oxygen
   composition give insight into how the bubble-water concentration
   gradient changes over depth. The surface mass transfer coefficient,
   k(Ls)a(s), is 59-85\% of the bubble mass transfer coefficient, k(L)a(b),
   and the driving concentration difference is smaller for surface
   transfer. Surface transfer and bubble transfer both contribute
   significantly to oxygen transfer; however, bubble transfer is the
   primary mode of oxygen transfer for this system at the air flow rates
   used. Further experiments demonstrate that most of the surface transfer
   occurs above the bubble plume. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A study was undertaken of the regeneration of three activated carbons
   exhausted with ortho-chlorophenol. The regeneration process was carried
   out using liquid water at 623 K and 150 atm in the absence of oxygen.
   The efficiency of this procedure was analyzed by determining the rate
   and amount of ortho-chlorophenol adsorbed in successive
   adsorption-regeneration cycles. The present procedure showed a much
   greater efficiency than that reported for chemical and/or thermal
   regeneration. Effects of this regeneration on the adsorption kinetics,
   adsorption capacity and textural characteristics of the carbon were
   investigated. The increase in adsorption capacity of the regenerated
   carbon compared with that of the original carbon seems mainly due to the
   opening of porosity during the regeneration treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{High-density polyethylene pipes (HDPE), crossbonded polyethylene pipes
   (PEX) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes for drinking water were tested
   with respect to migration of volatile organic components (VOC) to water.
   The odour of water in contact with plastic pipes was assessed according
   to the quantitative threshold odour number (TON) concept. A major
   migrating component from HDPE pipes was 2,4-di-tert-butyl-phenol
   (2,4-DTBP) which is a known degradation product from antioxidants such
   as Irgafos 168(R). In addition, a range of esters, aldehydes, ketones,
   aromatic hydrocarbons and terpenoids were identified as migration
   products from HDPE pipes. Water in contact with HDPE pipes was assessed
   with respect to TON, and values greater than or equal to 4 were
   determined for five out of seven brands of HDPE pipes. The total amount
   of VOC released to water during three successive test periods were
   fairly constant for the HDPE pipes. Corresponding migration tests
   carried out for PEX pipes showed that VOC migrated in significant
   amounts into the test water, and TON greater than or equal to 5 of the
   test water were observed in all tests. Several of the migrated VOC were
   not identified. Oxygenates predominated the identified VOC in the test
   water from PEX pipes. Migration tests of PVC pipes revealed few volatile
   migrants in the test samples and no significant odour of the test water.

Title = {{Important operational parameters of membrane bioreactor-sludge
   disintegration (MBR-SD) system for zero excess sludge production}},

Abstract = {{In order to prevent excess sludge production during wastewater
   treatment, a membrane bioreactor-sludge disintegration (MBR-SD) system
   has been introduced, where the disintegrated sludge is recycled to the
   bioreactor as a feed solution. In this study, a mathematical model was
   developed by incorporating a sludge disintegration term into the
   conventional activated sludge model and the relationships among the
   operational parameters were investigated. A new definition of F/M ratio
   for the MBR-SD system was suggested to evaluate the actual organic
   loading rate. The actual F/M ratio was expected to be much higher than
   the apparent F/M ratio in MBR-SD. The kinetic parameters concerning the
   biodegradability of organics hardly affect the system performance.
   Instead, sludge solubilization ratio (alpha) in the SD process and
   particulate hydrolysis rate constant (k(h)) in biological reaction
   determine the sludge disintegration number (SDN), which is related with
   the overall economics of the MBR-SD system. Under reasonable 06 and
   k(h), values, SDN would range between 3 and 5 which means the amount of
   sludge required to be disintegrated would be 3-5 times higher for
   preventing a particular amount of sludge production. Finally, normalized
   sludge disintegration rate (q/V) which is needed to maintain a certain
   level of MLSS in the MBR-SD system was calculated as a function of F/V
   ratio. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fixed-film continuous-flow photobioreactor was used for the removal of
   hydrogen sulfide from synthetic industrial wastewater and conversion of
   it to elemental sulfur using sixteen 150 mm length Tygon tubes as the
   active part of the reactor. Three different tube sizes (internal
   diameters (ID) 6.4, 3.2, and 1.6 mm) were used to investigate the effect
   of tube size on reactor performance. The reactor with 1.6 mm tube
   attained a higher sulfide loading (1451 mg/Lh) than previously reported
   in the literature. High bacterial concentration, light to volume ratio
   and intimate contact between attached bacteria and influent sulfide
   resulted in excellent performance of the 1.6 mm tube reactor. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{A new ruthenium(II) photosensitizer, {[}Ru-II(py-pzH)(3)](2+) (where
   py-pzH = 3-(2'-pyridyl)pyrazole), has been synthesized. The complex
   displayed outstanding excited state redox properties (estimated
   Ru-III/Ru-II{*} approximate to -1.24V vs. NHE) and was expected to
   sensitize the injection of electrons into the conduction band of anatase
   TiO2 upon visible irradiation. The photosensitizer was anchored onto the
   surface of anatase TiO2 particles via in situ silylation. The
   silyl-linkage displayed excellent stability in both aqueous media, over
   a wide pH range, and in common organic solvents. The resultant material,
   TiO2-{[}Ru-II(PY-PZ-Sidrop)(3)], was found to be able to mediate
   degradation Of CCl4 in neutral aqueous medium under broad band visible
   irradiation (lambda > 450 nm). The relation between the rate of
   degradation and concentration of substrate was explored and the
   mechanism of the photodegradation of the perhalogenated organic was
   discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The behaviour of a pilot scale biological phosphorus removal process
   (BPR) of the alternating type was investigated during periods of low
   influent concentrations and increased hydraulic load. A process
   disturbance of this type results in an increase in the phosphate
   concentration level in the anoxic/aerobic reactors and in the plant
   effluent shortly after the influent wastewater returns to normal
   strength. The accumulation of phosphorus in the system was avoided by
   the addition of an external carbon source either to the influent or to
   the effluent from the anaerobic reactor in form of sodium acetate. With
   the help of such an addition, the internal carbon storage compounds
   could be maintained at a high level, which is shown by
   poly-hydroxy-alcanoates (PHA) measurements. Several levels of acetate
   addition were investigated experimentally in order to determine a
   minimal amount of internally stored carbon, which could ensure the
   stabilization of BPR during such dynamic influent conditions.
   Furthermore reduction of aeration time during periods of low influent
   concentrations was investigated. It was observed that BPR was stabilized
   by combining a reduction of aeration time with carbon source addition,
   which maintained the internal stored carbon at a higher level. This
   combined control action resulted in a desired high BPR activity when the
   normal strength of the influent wastewater was reestablished. The
   failure of the BPR process was sometimes observed even when
   comparatively high concentrations of PHA could be detected and an
   identification of a minimal PHA level was not possible. During this
   investigation an accumulating organisms, is used for the detailed
   analysis of the experiments. The model predicted the phosphorus build-up
   after the process disturbance as well the performance during the
   stabilized experiments. Assisted by the model, the investigations
   indicate that a PHA limitation is not only factor affecting the recovery
   of the BPR process during periods of low influent concentrations. (C)

Abstract = {{We investigated whether manganese peroxidase (MnP) and the

   can remove the estrogenic activities of the steroidal hormones

   two-hybrid assay system, we confirmed that the estrogenic activities of
   E-2 and EE2 are much higher than those of bisphenol A and nonylphenol.
   Greater than 80\% of the estrogenic activities of E-2 and EE2 were
   removed following I-h treatment with MnP or the laccase-HBT system;
   extending the treatment time to 8 h removed the remaining estrogenic
   activity of both steroidal hormones. HPLC analysis demonstrated that E-2
   and EE2 had disappeared almost completely in the reaction mixture after
   a 1-h treatment. These results strongly suggest that these ligninolytic
   enzymes are effective in removing the estrogenic activities of E-2 and

Abstract = {{A pilot plant for ozonation and UV-disinfection received effluent from a
   German municipal sewage treatment plant (STP) to test the removal of
   pharmaceuticals, iodinated X-ray contrast media (ICM) and musk
   fragrances from municipal wastewater. In the original STP effluent, 5
   antibiotics (0.344.63 mug l(-1)), 5 betablockers (0.18-1.7 mug l(-1)), 4
   antiphlogistics (0.10-1.3 mug l(-1)), 2 lipid regulator metabolites
   (0.12-0.13 mug l(-1)), the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine (2.1 mug
   l(-1)), 4 ICM (1.1-5.2 mug l(-1)), the natural estrogen estrone (0.015
   mug l(-1)) and 2 musk fragrances (0.14.73 mug l(-1)) were detected by
   LC-electrospray tandem MS and/or GC/MS/MS. ICM, derived from
   radiological examinations, were present with the highest concentrations
   (diatrizoate: 5.7 mug l(-1), iopromide: 5.2 mug l(-1)). By applying
   10-15 mg l(-1) ozone (contact time: 18 min), all the pharmaceuticals
   investigated as well as musk fragrances (HHCB, AHTN) and estrone were no
   longer detected. However, ICM (diatrizoate, iopamidol, iopromide and
   iomeprol) were still detected in appreciable concentrations. Even with a
   15 mg l(-1) ozone dose, the ionic diatrizoate only exhibited removal
   efficiencies of not higher than 14\%, while the non-ionic ICM were
   removed to a degree of higher than 80\%. Advanced oxidation processes
   (O-3/UV-low pressure mercury arc, O-3/H2O2), which were non-optimized
   for wastewater treatment, did not lead significantly to a higher removal
   efficiency for the ICM than ozone alone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Concentrations of cadmium, copper, mercury, lead and zinc were
   determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry in the muscle, gill
   and liver of bream Abramis brama L. to study the relationship between
   the heavy metal load of fish and their age and size, and the seasonal
   variation of pollutant loads. Fish were collected from the Western basin
   of Lake Balaton (Hungary) in October 1999 and May 2000. The average
   metal concentrations of different organs varied in the following ranges:
   Cd 0.42-2.10; Cu 1.77-56.2; Hg 0.01-0.19; Pb 0.44-3.24; Zn 10.9-82.5 mug
   g(-1) dry weight. The highest Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn concentrations were
   detected in the gill or liver of fish, whereas the highest Hg
   concentrations were measured in the muscle. In the liver of bream for
   cadmium, copper and mercury the Pearson correlation analysis revealed
   positive associations related to age and size (length, net weight), as
   well as for the mercury load of all three investigated organs. In the
   muscle and gill the copper, lead and zinc concentrations, similarly to
   the lead and zinc concentrations of the liver, the associations related
   to age and size were negative. The correlations between the heavy metal
   concentrations of organs and the individual condition factors of fish
   samples proved to have opposite trends compared to those related to the
   age and size of fish. The seasonal variations in the heavy metal load of
   bream could be attributed rather to the seasonal change in the condition
   factor of fish than to variations in the pollutant load of the site. (C)

Abstract = {{Wetland construction on agricultural or dairy lands could result in
   solubilization of phosphorus (P) stored in soils and release to the
   water column. To study the extent of P flux during the start-up period
   of a constructed wetland, intact soil-cores from areas used for dairy
   operations, in Okeechobee, Florid a, USA were obtained and flooded with
   adjacent creek water. In the first 28-day hydraulic-retention period, P
   concentration in the water column increased several fold due to rapid P
   flux from impacted soils. A continuous decrease in P flux to the water
   column until the third hydraulic retention cycle (initial influent P
   concentration 0.2 mg L-1), and constant thereafter suggest that the
   effect of initial influent P upon long-term P flux from soils could be
   limited. The initial release maybe due to high concentration of labile P
   in impacted soils; however, slow dissolution of relatively stable P
   pools could maintain a steady flux, well above of that observed from
   non-impacted soils. Water soluble P along with double acid-extractable
   magnesium explained 76\% of the variability in cumulative P flux to the
   water column. Apparently, co-occurrence of active adsorption-desorption
   phenomena due to independent maintenance of equilibrium by individual P
   compounds regulates P dynamics of the water column. The results
   indicated that equilibrium P concentration of the water column of the
   wetland would be above 1.3 mg L-1, which is well above the targeted P
   level in the water column of the Lake Okeechobee, one of the main water
   bodies in the area (0.04mg P L-1).,This suggests construction of
   wetlands in agricultural lands could result to substantial internal P
   loading. However, preventative measures including chemical amendments,
   establishment of vegetative communities or flushing the initially
   released P may potentially stabilize the system, and maintain P removal
   efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new control strategy for the methanogenic reactor of a two-phase
   anaerobic digestion system has been developed and successfully tested on
   the laboratory scale. The control strategy serves the purpose to detect
   inhibitory effects and to achieve good conversion. The concept is based
   on the idea that volatile fatty acids (VFA) can be measured in the
   influent of the methanogenic reactor by means of titration. Thus,
   information on the output (methane production) and input of the
   methanogenic reactor is available, and a (carbon) mass balance can be
   obtained. The control algorithm comprises a proportional/integral
   structure with the ratio of (a) the methane production rate measured
   online and (b) a maximum methane production rate expected (derived from
   the stoichiometry) as a control variable. The manipulated variable is
   the volumetric feed rate. Results are shown for an experiment with VFA
   (feed) concentration ramps and for experiments with sodium chloride as
   inhibitor. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-catalyzed removal, of
   2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) by an electrochemical packed-bed flow
   reactor operated in a circulating batch,mode with the help of in situ
   generated hydrogen peroxide. HRP immobilized on the reticulated vitreous
   carbon electrode was prepared for the cyclic voltammetry of 2,4,6-TNT.
   Effects of pH and temperature on the TNT electroreduction in 0.2 M
   phosphate buffer saturated with oxygen were examined. HRP immobilized
   carbon electrode was capable of catalyzing the oxidation and
   detoxification of 44 muM TNT in aqueous solution under optimized
   conditions. The removal rate of TNT for the electroenzymatic method was
   much greater than for electrochemical and biochemical methods.
   Stoichiometric and kinetic studies indicated that the hydrogen peroxide
   was utilized more effectively in the electroenzymatic method.
   Denitrification as intermediate reaction was also investigated. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{A representative alkylphenol Triton X-100 (having 9.5 oxyethylene
   subunits) was treated over 40 days under the conditions of the
   continuous flow activated sludge simulation test in a plant with
   aeration and denitrification chambers. Treated sewage was separated by
   sequential extraction with ethyl acetate and chloroform. The extracts
   were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray
   ionisation-mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS). Single ion chromatograms of
   the chloroform extracts showed the presence of neutral, mono- and
   di-carboxylated poly(ethylene glycols). This is evidence of the central
   fission of alkylphenol ethoxylates (APE). Simultaneously, the APE having
   omega-carboxylated oxyethylene chains were identified. This is the
   evidence that apart from central fission, the omega-oxidation
   oxyethylene chain pathway also occurs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Title = {{Heterogeneity of natural organic matter from the Chena River, Alaska}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1015-1022}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Water samples were collected in July 2001 from the Chena River in
   central Alaska. The natural organic matter (NOM) was size fractionated
   into particulate (POM, > 0.45 mum), colloidal (COM, 1 kDa-0.45 mum) and
   dissolved (DOM, < 1, kDa) organic, matter fractions, using filtration
   and ultrafiltration. The size-fractionated organic matter was then
   analyzed for organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N), isotopic (delta(13)C
   and delta(15)N) and molecular composition, using continuous flow isotope
   ratio mass spectrometry and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). Results of phase partitioning showed that, on
   average, about 6\% of OC and 16\% of N occurred in the form of POM while
   66\% of OC and 57\% of N occurred in the form of COM, and 28\% of the OC
   and 27\% of the N were in the DOM form. Organic matter in the river
   water was found to be highly heterogeneous in terms of chemical
   composition and isotopic signatures. The C/N ratio was as low as 16 +/-
   1 in the POM (n = 2) to as high as 48 +/- 1 in the COM (n = 3) and 38
   +/- 4 in the DOM (n = 3), suggesting a diagenetically younger PO M.
   Values of delta(13)C increased with decreasing size, varying from -29.59
   +/- 0.45\% in the POM to -27.47 +/- 0.06\% in the COM to -16.93 +/-
   0.08\% in the DOM. In contrast, values of delta(15)N decreased with
   decreasing size, from 2.64\% in POM to 1.64\% in COM to 1.33\% in DOM.
   These results, together with radiocarbon measurements, suggest a
   preferential decomposition of lighter C isotope (C-12) and heavier N
   isotopic (N-15) from POM to COM to DOM. Results of py-GC/MS showed that
   the percentage of polysaccharides decreased with decreasing size,
   further supporting a degradation pathway of NOM from POM to COM and DOM
   in Chena River waters. More studies are needed to examine the seasonal
   and spatial variations of size-fractionated organic matter. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The ozonation of highly condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
   was studied in oil/water-emulsions, which are comparable to poorly
   water-soluble PAH in industrial wastewaters and at contaminated sites.
   As there was a lack of knowledge about the ozonation in
   oil/water-emulsions, first the ozone mass transfer was studied and
   optimized from the gas to the water phase and from the water to the oil
   phase. The ratio of mass transfer and oxidation reaction was determined
   by the Hatta-number and revealed a slow, quasi homogeneous reaction of
   ozone with PAR inside the oil droplets. Because the ozone gas
   concentration had no influence under the optimized conditions, the
   selective PAH-ozonation could be described microkinetically by a direct
   ozone reaction of pseudo-first order regarding PAH-concentrations. The
   determined PAH mean reaction rate constants of 1.02 min(-1) in
   oil/water-emulsions are in the upper range as found for PAH dissolved in
   water. These results give a new insight into the ozonation in the
   three-phase systems and into the treatment of highly condensed, hardly
   biodegradable PAR (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the specific gas loading rate on the acidifying, sulfate
   reducing and sulfur removal capacity of thermophilic (55degreesC; pH
   6.0) granular sludge bed reactors treating partly acidified wastewater
   was investigated. A comparison was made between a regular UASB reactor
   and a UASB reactor continuously sparged with N-2 at a specific gas
   loading rate of 30 m(3) m(-2) d(-1). Both UASB reactors (upflow velocity
   1.0 m h(-1), hydraulic retention time about 5 h) were fed a synthetic
   wastewater containing starch, sucrose, lactate, propionate and acetate
   and a low sulfate concentration (COD/SO42- ratio of 10) at volumetric
   organic loading rates (OLR) ranging from 4.0 to 49.8 gCOD l(-1) reactor
   d(-1). Immediately after imposing an OLR of 25 gCOD l(-1) reactor d(-1),
   the acidification and sulfate reduction efficiency dropped to 80\% and
   30\%, respectively, in the UASB reactor. Both efficiencies recovered
   slowly to 100\% during the course of the experiment. In the N-2 SParged
   reactor, both the acidification and sulfate reduction efficiency
   remained 100\% following the OLR increase to 25 gCOD l(-1) reactor
   d(-1). However, the sulfate reduction efficiency gradually decreased to
   about 20\% at the end of the experiment. The biogas (CO2 and CH4)
   production rate in the UASB was very low,-i.e. <31 biogas 1(-1) reactor
   day(-1), resulting in-negligible amounts (<20\%) of H2S stripped from
   the reactor liquid. The total H2S concentration of the N-2 sparged UASB
   reactor effluent was always below 25 mg l(-1), but incomplete sulfate
   reduction kept the maximal H2S stripping efficiency below 70\%. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The harmful effects of NH3 on the zooplankton community in a deep waste
   treatment pond were evaluated under natural conditions. The pond,
   supplied with secondary effluent from a conventional urban wastewater
   treatment plant, was designed to improve water quality for agricultural
   reuse.
   The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis suggested in Arauzo et
   al. (Water Environ. Res. 34(14), 3666) that during phytoplankton blooms
   in the stratification periods high un-ionised ammonia content values,
   due to an intense photosynthetic activity and high related pH, lead to a
   decrease in zooplankton biomass and, thus, to a collapse of the
   treatment process efficiency.
   Empirical models were developed to determine relationships between
   phytoplankton biomass, pH and NH3 levels. They provided an easy and
   quick method of detecting when the system was liable to collapse due to
   the NH3 effect on the zooplankton community and offered the possibility
   of adopting measures to guarantee water quality at the effluent. A
   significant decrease in zooplankton community biomass was observed at
   un-ionised ammonia levels over 2.5 mg L-1 (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Pesticides used in Portuguese agricultural areas have been found in
   surface and ground waters. In the surface water collected in three river
   basins from 1983 to 1999, insecticides and herbicides were detected from
   the monitored pesticides, particularly atrazine, chlorfenvinphos (Z +
   E), alpha- and beta-endosulfan, lindane, molinate and simazine, reaching
   the maximum values, respectively, of 0.63, 31.6, 0.18 mug/L
   (alpha-endosulfan), 0.18 mug/L (beta-endosulfan), 0.24, 48 and 0.3 mug/
   L. In the ground water collected from the wells of seven agricultural
   areas from 1991 to 1998, several monitored herbicides were detected:
   alachlor, atrazine, metolachlor, metribuzine and simazine, reaching the
   maximum concentration values of 0, 30, 56, 1.4 and 0.4 mug/L,
   respectively. The herbicides more frequently detected were atrazine
   (64\%), simazine (45\%) and alachlor (25\%). Other than these, the
   monitored pesticides can be present in Portuguese surface and ground
   waters. Therefore, to improve the analytical conditions, the use of
   multiresidue methods and automated techniques are desirable in future
   work. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{UV irradiation at a wavelength of 253.7 nm (UV254) is commonly used for
   drinking water disinfection. UV radiation is known to convert
   organically combined phosphorus to orthophosphate and to degrade natural
   organic matter. We studied if UV disinfection increases the amount of
   microbially available forms of organic carbon and phosphorus in drinking
   waters with different characteristics, and if these changes in water
   chemical quality could enhance the microbial growth in drinking water.
   The UV254 dose (15-50 mW s/cm(2)) used in waterworks reduced the
   concentration of assimilable organic carbon and the sum of the molecular
   size fractions. The release of microbially available phosphorus needed
   higher doses (204 mW s/cm(2)) of UV254 radiation. Of bacteria in
   drinking water, 90\% were inactivated with UV254-irradiation doses below
   50 mW s/cm(2). A high dose (501 MW s/cm(2)) of UV254 radiation inhibited
   the microbial growth in water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{It was found that anaerobic sludge particles contain gas bubbles. Due to
   the compressibility of the bubbles, which are entrapped in the sludge
   agglomerates, a pressure-dependent sedimentation characteristic of the
   sludge particles was found and mathematically described. Enhanced
   hydrostatic pressure results in a considerable increase of the settling
   velocity of sludge particles. On this basis the concept of a
   hydrostatically pressurized sedimenter is presented and its performance
   analyzed. Due to the hydrostatical pressurization of the sedimenter the
   produced gas is kept in the liquid phase until the liquid phase is
   saturated. To avoid a degassing of the liquid which results in the
   undesired release of gas bubbles a maximum liquid dwell time in the
   sedimenter must not be exceeded. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Silica is an important natural component of ground and surface waters,
   and is sometimes added as an inhibitor to control ``red water{''}
   problems caused by corroding iron pipes. However, the effect of
   silicates on many aspects of iron corrosion has never been assessed.
   Experiments with water containing 0.5, 10, 25 or 50 mg/L of SiO2
   demonstrated a significant interplay between aqueous silica and iron
   corrosion. During this 4-month experiment, higher levels of silica
   caused more iron release to the water and decreased the size of
   suspended iron particles. The process of iron corrosion also changed
   aqueous silica concentrations; silica was released into the water from
   the cast iron during corrosion and was removed from the water by
   incorporation into the scale layer. Silica also affected the type of
   scale that formed on the iron coupons. Scale at the lower silica
   concentrations was fairly uniform and easy to remove from the coupons,
   while the scale from the high silica reactors was more dense, and was
   more difficult to remove. Scale from the high concentration silica
   reactor also developed tall tubercles, and hydrogen gas-containing
   bubbles were channeled to solution through these tubercles. Iron
   corrosion occurring via the evolution was significant under all
   experimental conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrodialysis experiments of the lysine fermentation waste were
   performed to generate demineralized feed and ammonium sulfate, which can
   be utilized as a fertilizer and an animal feed, respectively. The
   electrodialysis performances were compared for different ion exchange
   membranes in terms of ammonium sulfate removal rate, resistance and
   conductivity change. Analysis of fouling phenomena revealed that
   organics fouled ion exchange membranes reversibly in electrodialysis of
   the fermentation waste. In this study, mitigation of membrane fouling
   with the pulsed electric field was examined for the electrodialysis of
   the fermentation waste containing strong foulants. The half-wave power
   reduced membrane fouling significantly. For a quantitative measure of
   the membrane fouling tendency, a membrane fouling index for
   electrodialysis was used. This study showed the potential use of pulsed
   power as an effective fouling mitigation method for the electrodialysis

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1100-1110}},

Abstract = {{It is clear from the fundamental biochemical processes that
   nitrification of extremely concentrated ammonia loads requires-among
   others-(1) sufficient alkalinity to buffer acidification and (2)
   bicarbonate as the substrate for the autotrophic biomass. However, at
   low pH values the aeration process causes CO(2) stripping and
   consequently a decrease of the available inorganic carbon. In order to
   analyse such complex interactions, we suggest in this paper an enhanced
   version of the widely acknowledged IWA (formerly IAWQ) activated sludge
   models. These model enlargements comprise an ion-balance for the
   calculation of the pH value and of dissociation species, a balance of
   inorganic carbon and a more detailed description of the relevant
   N-elimination processes and their inhibitions. The model was
   successfully employed to optimise a treatment strategy for
   rejection-water and landfill leachate (500-2000 mg ammonia-N l(-1),
   COD/N ratio of 0.25-4). Detailed data from two full-scale
   rejection-water treatment plants were used for systems identification,
   model calibration and validation. The results suggest that inhibition
   and limitation by nitrous acid (HNO(2)) and unionised ammonia (NH(3))
   have often been overestimated. In this investigation the bicarbonate
   concentration proved to be crucial for the process. The optimisation of
   the bicarbonate concentration in the reactor could improve the
   nitrozation rate up to 100mg NH(4)(+)-N l(-1) h(-1). (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Giardia and Cryptosporidium have emerged as waterborne pathogens of
   concern for public health. The aim of this study is to examine both
   parasites in the water samples taken from three pilot-scale plant
   processes located in southern Taiwan, to upgrade the current facilities.
   Three processes include: conventional process without prechlorination
   (Process 1), conventional process plus ozonation and pellet softening
   (Process 2), and integrated membrane process (MF plus NF) followed
   conventional process (Process 3). The detection methods of both
   parasites are modified from USEPA Methods 1622 and 1623. Results
   indicated that coagulation, sedimentation and filtration removed the
   most percentage of both protozoan parasites. The pre-ozonation step can
   destruct both parasites, especially for Giardia cysts. The
   microfiltration systems can intercept Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium
   oocysts completely., A significant correlation between water turbidity
   and Cryptosporidium oocysts was found in,this study. The similar results
   were also found between three kinds of particles (Phi = 3-5,5-8 and 8-10
   mum) and Cryptosporidium oocysts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to evaluate the settleability and dewaterability
   of fungal treated and untreated sludge using liquid state bioconversion
   process. The fungal mixed culture of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium
   corylophilum was used for fungal pretreatment of wastewater sludge. The
   fungal strains immobilized/entrapped on sludge particles with the
   formation of pellets and enhanced the separation process. The results
   presented in this study showed that the sludge particles (pellets) size
   of 2-5 mm of diameter were formed with the microbial treatment of sludge
   after 2 days of fermentation that contained maximum 33.7\% of total
   particles with 3-3.5 mm of diameter. The settling rate (measured as
   total suspended solids (TSS) concentration, 130mg/l) was faster in
   treated sludge than untreated sludge (TSS concentration, 440 mg/l) after
   1 min of settling time. In I min of settling operation, 86.45\% of TSS
   was settled in treated sludge while 4.35\% of TSS settled in raw sludge.
   Lower turbidity was observed in treated sludge as compared to untreated
   sludge. The results to specific resistance to filtration (SRF) revealed
   that the fungal inoculum had significant potentiality to reduce SRF by
   99.8\% and 98.7\% for 1\% w/w and 4\% w/w of TSS sludge, respectively.
   The optimum fermentation period recorded was 3 days for 1\% w/w sludge
   and 6 days for 4\% w/w sludge, respectively, for dewaterability test.

Abstract = {{A solar photocatalytic cascade reactor was constructed to study the
   photocatalytic oxidation of benzoic acid in water under various
   experimental and weather conditions at HKUST. Nine stainless steel
   plates coated with TiO2 catalyst were arranged in a cascade
   configuration in the reactor. Photolytic degradation and adsorption were
   confirmed to be insignificant total organic carbon (TOC) removal
   mechanisms. A turbulent flow pattern and, hence, improved mixing in the
   liquid film were achieved due to the unique cascade design of the
   reactor. The photoinduced consumption of oxygen during reactions was
   demonstrated in a sample experiment. The proposed rate equations
   provided good fits to 90 data points from 17 experiments. The regression
   results showed that the TOC removal rates averaged over 30 min intervals
   did not illustrate significant dependence on TOC0 and that I-mean was
   more important in affecting the photocatalytic process within the ranges
   of the data examined. The percentage removal of TOC in 71 of 100 mg/l
   (or 100 ppm) benzoic acid solutions increased from 30\% to 83\% by
   adding 10ml of hydrogen peroxide solution (30wt\%). Hydrogen peroxide
   was also shown to enhance the efficiency of the degradation process at
   elevated temperatures. Ortho-, meta-and para-hydroxybenzoic acids were
   identified by HPLC analysis as the intermediates of benzoic acid during
   reactions without She addition of hydrogen peroxide solutions. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Seasonal change of virulent phage infected to two E. coli O157:H7
   strains (O:157-phage) in the influent of a domestic wastewater treatment
   plant in the central part of Japan and fate of O:157-phage in the plant
   were monitored almost monthly from March 2001 to February 2002.
   Coliphage infected to nonpathogenic E. coli O157:H7 ATCC43888
   (43888-phage) was detected for 1 year. On the other hand, phage infected
   to pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 EDL933 (EDL-phage) was detected
   intermittently. Concentration of EDL-phage was almost one-tenth of that
   of 43888-phage. The progressive decrease in phage concentration with the
   treatment steps was observed. No phage was detected in the supernatant
   from the secondary settling tank and effluent. PCR amplification of the
   Stx 2 gene that encodes Shiga toxin (Stx) was observed when O:157-phage
   concentration in the influent was high x 10(3) PFU/ml order.
   Concentration and percentage of suspended O:157-phage decreased with the
   progress of the wastewater treatment. 933W phage, which encodes Stx 2
   gene, was more fragile and sensitive to chlorination than T4 phage.
   However, addition of 0.02mg/l chlorine, in conformance with the required
   concentration of the plant, did not affect the viability of T4 and 933W
   phages. On the other hand, 1 mg/l chlorine inactivated the 933W phage
   significantly. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The infiltration of urban roof runoff into well permeable subsurface
   material may have adverse effects on the ground water quality and
   endanger drinking water resources. Precipitation water from three
   different roofs of an industrial complex was channelled to a pit and
   infiltrated into a perialpine glaciofluvial gravel-and-sand aquifer. A
   shaft was constructed at the bottom of the pit and equipped with an
   array of TDR probes, lysimeters and suction cups that allowed measuring
   and sampling soil water at different depths. A fast infiltration flow
   was observed during natural rainfall events and during artificial
   infiltration experiments. For a better understanding of the behaviour of
   contaminants, experiments were conducted with cocktails of compounds of
   different reactivity (ammonium, strontium, atratone) and of non-reactive
   tracers (uranine, bromide, naphthionate), which represent different
   classes of pollutants. The experiment identified cation exchange
   reactions influencing the composition of the infiltrating water. These
   processes occurred under preferential flow conditions in macropores of
   the material. Measuring concentration changes under the controlled
   inflow of tracer experiments, the pollution potential was found to be
   high. Non-reactive tracers exhibited fast breakthrough and little
   sorption. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an evaluation of the catalytic performances of a
   Fe-exchanged Al-pillared synthetic beidellite for the wet hydrogen
   peroxide oxidation of phenolic aqueous wastes. The catalyst was prepared
   by a cation doping technique, its properties being determined by DRX,
   BET and chemical analysis techniques. All the tests were performed on a
   laboratory scale set-up.
   Important factors affecting catalyst activity and phenol removal
   efficiencies were studied, i.e. the effect of pH, temperature, catalyst
   concentration and the stability of the catalyst. The experimental
   results indicate that the use of this catalyst allows a total
   elimination of phenol and a significant removal of chemical oxygen
   demand, without significant leaching of Fe ions. Thus, considering the
   lowest Fe concentrations in solution after oxidation, at pH = 5,
   50degreesC, and 180 min. COD removal efficiency of 87.9\% was obtained.
   It was also observed that by using this catalyst, it is possible to
   extend the range of pH values for which Fenton-type oxidations can
   occur. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carbonyl compounds are considered to be the most common ozonation
   by-products. Apart from well-known chlorites and chlorates, chlorine
   dioxide (ClO2) also generates organic by-products. The goal of this
   paper is an investigation into the influence of disinfection with ClO2
   on the aldehydes formation. Three types of waters were disinfected with
   different doses Of ClO2 at the various pH values. The results of size
   exclusion chromatography show that the reaction Of ClO2 with humic
   fraction of natural organic matter proceeds mainly on an aromatic part
   of the molecules. The results obtained indicate that the level of
   carbonyls concentration can significantly increase with the time Of ClO2
   reaction with carbonyl precursors in treated water. There is no
   noticeable correlation between quantity of aldehydes and pH value of
   disinfected water. The range of ``productivity{''} of aldehydes in water
   treated with chlorine dioxide is similar to the range estimated for the
   carbonyls formed upon ozonation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this study, pretreatment of Afyon (Turkey) alcaloide factory,
   wastewater, a typical high strength industrial wastewater (chemical
   oxygen demand (COD) = 26.65 kg m(-3), biological oxygen demand (BOD5) =
   3.95 kg m(-3)), was carried out by wet air oxidation process. The
   process was performed in a 0.75 litre specially designed bubble reactor.
   Experiments were conducted to see-the advantages of one-stage and
   two-stage oxidation and the effects of pressure, pH, temperature,
   catalyst type, catalyst loading and air or oxygen as gas source on the
   oxidation of the wastewater. In addition, BOD5/COD ratios of the
   effluents, which are generally regarded as an important index of
   biodegradability of a high-strength industrial wastewater, were
   determined at the end of some runs. After a 2 h oxidation (T =
   150degreesC, P = 0.65 MPa, airflow rate = 1.57 x 10(-5) m(3) s(-1), pH =
   7.0), the BOD5/COD ratio was increased from 0.15 to above 0.5 by using

Abstract = {{Physical-chemical pre-treatment was used for the reverse osmosis unit
   for reclamation of secondary effluents. The pilot plant was equipped
   with a variety of tertiary treatment units to prevent fouling and

   concentrations of lime to raise the pH to 10.3-12.1, and to stabilise
   the sludge generated, as well as different dosages of ferric chloride
   (15, 20, and 25 mg/L) for the coagulation and solid-liquid separation.
   Sodium hypochlorite (8 mg/L) and UV disinfection are used for
   microbiological control. The water quality obtained, under the optimum
   conditions (pH = 10.5; FeCl3: 25 mg/L; anionic flocculant: 0.5 mg/L;
   sodium hypochlorite: 8 mg/L) was high, showing an average conductivity

   pseudo-first-order kinetic and the reaction rate constants with ozone
   varied widely. A linear relationship between logarithm of global COD
   degradation rate constant and the energy of the highest occupied
   molecular orbit, E-homo, was obtained for these NSAs with a regression
   coefficient of 0.88 and a slope of 0.4672eV(-1). TOC degradation
   kinetics also reached similar results with a regression coefficient of
   0.90 and a slope of 0.9336eV(-1). The results of correlation analysis
   suggested that TOC and COD removal in ozonation of NSAs follow the
   frontier orbital theory and can be predicted by E-homo, which indicated
   that electrophilic effect was the main factor in the ozonation of NSAs.
   Therefore, it is possible to improve the biodegradability of dyestuff
   wastewater bearing mainly NSAs by ozonation at an accepted cost and
   evaluate the economy of ozonation process. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Factors affecting filtration performance were investigated in a
   sequencing batch reactor (SBR) coupled with a submerged microfiltration
   module. Special bioreactors for aerobic and anoxic phases were
   specifically designed in order to differentiate the effect of dissolved
   oxygen (DO) from that of mixing intensity, on membrane filterability.
   When the filterability of a submerged microfilter was examined at each
   SBR phase, DO concentration, as well as mixing intensity proved to have
   a major influence on the membrane performance regardless of the SBR
   phase. A higher DO concentration resulted in a slower rise in TMP,
   corresponding to less membrane fouling, which was investigated in depth
   through a series of analyses including resistance measurements and
   compressibility of the cake layer as well as particle sizes as a
   functions of DO for both aerobic and anoxic phases in SBR. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Building predictive models for highly time varying and complex
   multivariable aspects of the wastewater treatment plant is important
   both for understanding the dynamics of this complex system, and in the
   development of optimal control support and management schemes.
   This paper presents a new approach, which is called genetic programming
   as a self-organising modelling tool, to model dynamic performance of
   municipal activated-sludge wastewater treatment plants. Genetic
   programming evolves several process models automatically based on
   methods of natural selection ('survival of the fittest'), that could
   predict the dynamics of MLSS and suspended solids in the effluent.
   The predictive accuracy of the genetic programming approach was compared
   with a nonlinear state-space model with neural network and a well-known
   IAWQ ASM2. The genetic programming system evolved some models that were
   an improvement over the neural network and ASM2 and showed that the
   transparency of the model evolved may allow inferences about underlying
   processes to be made. This work demonstrates that dynamic nonlinear
   processes in the wastewater treatment plant may be successfully modelled
   through the use of evolutionary model induction algorithms in GP
   technique. Further, our results show that genetic programming can work
   as a cost-effective intelligent modelling tool, enabling us to create
   prototype process models quickly and inexpensively instead of an
   engineer developing the process model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The estrogen receptor (ER) binding affinities of 25 compounds including
   15 industrial phenolic chemicals, two phytoestrogens, three natural
   steroids and one man-made steroid were detected by a binding competition
   assay. The 17 industrial phenolic chemicals were selected as objective
   compounds because they are possibly released from epoxy and
   polyester-styrene resins used in lacquer coatings of concrete tank and
   lining of steel pipe in water supply system. A quantitative
   structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for structurally diverse phenols,
   nine alkylphenols with only one alkyl group, four hydroxyl biphenyls,
   bisphenol A and four natural and man-made estrogens was established by
   applying a quantum chemical modeling method. Logarithm of octanol-water
   coefficient (log Pow), molecular volume (V-m), and energies of the
   highest occupied molecular orbital (epsilon(HOMO)) and lowest unoccupied
   molecular orbital (epsilon(LUMO)) were selected as hydrophobic, steric
   (V-m), and electronic chemical descriptors, respectively. Chemicals
   capable of ER binding had large V-m and high epsilon(HOMO), while the
   effects of log Pow and epsilon(LUMO) on the binding affinity could not
   be identified. The QSAR made successful predictions for the three
   phytoestrogens. Also, the successful prediction of ER-binding affinity
   for biochanin A, another phytoestrogen, two indicators of pH
   (phenolphthalin and phenolphthalein) and one alkylphenolic chemical with
   three alkyl groups (4-methyl-2,6-di-butyl-phenol), by amending the V-m
   in the above-mentioned QSAR according to the electron-density
   distribution (or HOMO density) is an additional step in the elucidation
   of chemical steric and electronic parameters for predicting the binding
   affinities of phenolic compounds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The extractive membrane bioreactor (EMB) employs a dense silicone rubber
   membrane to selectively extract hydrophobic organic compounds from
   industrial wastewaters into a bioreactor in order to biodegrade them.
   The major drawback of the EMB is excess biofilm growth on the membrane,
   which limits mass transfer and creates oxygen limitations. In this work,
   nitrate has been used as an electron acceptor instead of oxygen. Due to
   the high solubility of nitrate in water, it is hypothesised that nitrate
   penetrates the whole biofilm, preventing the formation of inactive zones
   of bacteria. Four experiments have been performed with toluene as a
   model substrate under anoxic conditions. The effect of nitrate
   concentrations on the biofilm and on the toluene flux have been
   investigated. In addition, the production of soluble microbial products
   (SMPs), and bacterial hydrophobicity were studied.
   Under high nitrate concentrations, the performance of the anoxic EMB was
   stable and no biofilm was formed. The bacteria metabolised toluene, and
   the toluene flux remained approximately constant. Conversely, at low
   nitrate concentration, a decrease in pollutant flux concomitant with
   biofilm growth was observed. The production of SNlPs increased under
   limiting nitrate concentrations, but the hydrophobicity of the suspended
   bacteria remained constant. However, the bacterial hydrophobicity of the
   attached cells was significantly greater than that of the suspended
   cells. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of biological denitrification have been studied and several
   models, with varying degree of complexity, to be used for design
   purposes have been presented in the recent years. However, most of these
   kinetic studies were performed with mixed (and not well defined)
   microbial systems, such as activated sludge. In the present work,
   kinetic experiments were carried out in order to study the dynamic
   characteristics of a defined mixed culture of the denitrifiers
   Pseudomonas denitrificans and Bacillus subtilis under anoxic and aerobic
   conditions in a defined synthetic medium involving a mixture of organic
   substrates, in the presence of nitrates and/or nitrites. Denitrification
   was assumed to occur by the consecutive reduction of nitrates to
   nitrites and then to nitrogen gas without accumulation of intermediate
   gaseous products. The behavior of these defined mixed cultures was
   predicted using a kinetic model based on the kinetic models that have
   already been developed for each bacterium separately and the predictions
   were compared with the results from mixed culture experiments. The
   overall mathematical model that was developed and validated in the
   present work is capable of describing the behavior of the mixed culture
   in the above conditions, i.e. the nitrates-and nitrites reduction
   kinetics, the cell growth, and the organic carbon utilization rates. (C)

Abstract = {{High autotrophic nitrogen removal rates of 858 mg NL-1 day(-1) or 1.55 g
   N m(-2) day(-1) were obtained in a lab-scale rotating biological
   contactor treating an ammonium rich influent. It was postulated that
   ammonium was removed as dinitrogen gas by a sequence of aerobic ammonium
   oxidation to nitrite taking place in the outer biofilm layer and
   anaerobic ammonium oxidation with nitrite as electron acceptor occuring
   in the deeper biofilm layer. Chemical evidence for anaerobic ammonium
   oxidation within intact biofilm sludge from a lab-scale rotating
   biological contactor could be provided, without direct identification of
   responsible organisms catalysing this reaction. N-15 tracer techniques
   were used for identification and quantification of nitrogen
   transformations. In batch tests with biofilm sludge at dissolved oxygen
   concentrations lower than 0.1 mg L-1, ammonium and nitrite did react in
   a stoichiometric ratio of 1: 1.43 thereby forming dinitrogen. N-15
   isotope dilution calculations revealed that anaerobic ammonium oxidation
   was the major nitrogen transformation leading to concomitant ammonium
   and nitrite removal. Isotopic analysis of the produced biogas showed
   that both ammonium-N and nitrite-N were incorporated in N-2. (C) 2003

   acid esters (PAEs) have demonstrated that the compounds with short ester
   hydrocarbon chains are easily biodegraded and mineralized, but PAEs with
   long ester chains are less susceptible to degradation and some of them
   are considered recalcitrant. Moreover, they inhibit methanogenesis.
   However, studies have not been made on the effect of feeding a
   combination of recalcitrant and biodegradable PAEs into anaerobic
   digesters treating wastewater sludge. The present study was conducted
   with wastewater sludge from the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation's
   Hyperion Treatment Plant. Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), the most
   common persistent PAE found in wastewater, and di-n-butyl phthalate
   (DBP), a common PAE with short ester chains, were sorbed into the sludge
   fed to a bench-scale digester for a period of 12 weeks. DEHP degradation
   was always poor, and accumulation of DEHP was correlated with inhibition
   of the microbial degradation of DBP and with process instability of the
   test digester. Inhibition of the DBP removal was completely reversed
   after DEHP addition was discontinued, but biogas production never
   recovered to the level observed in a control digester. Other process
   parameters of digester performance were not affected by DEHP
   accumulation. These results are similar to the toxic effects of long
   chain fatty acids on sludge digestion, suggesting that DEHP or its
   degradation products affect all the microbial populations in the
   anaerobic bioreactor. Our results imply that high levels of DEHP or
   other recalcitrant PAEs in wastewater sludge are likely to compromise
   methanogenesis and removal of biodegradable PAEs in sludge digesters.

   metal mass load rate was increased by a factor of approximately 4.6. No
   breakthrough of metals was recorded. The use of macrophytes and
   adsorption media did not enhance heavy metal reduction significantly
   after 13 months of operation. A correlation analysis indicated strong
   positive correlations between conductivity on one side and other
   variables including temperature, total solids, dissolved oxygen and the
   redox potential on the other side. Some expensive or time-consuming
   variables (e.g., biochemical oxygen demand) can be predicted with less
   expensive ones (e.g., dissolved oxygen and temperature). The associated

Abstract = {{The use of raw and treated wastewater for irrigation of crops is a
   common practice in Mexico. In force since January 1997, the Water
   Quality Norms for helminth ova refer only to the number of eggs that can
   be present in the irrigation water, and ignore the assessment of
   viability because the conventional techniques are not suitable for
   routine application. However, since viability is of prime importance in
   the epidemiology of parasitic infections, work was done for the
   development of a rapid and reliable method to detect a metabolic
   activity or a physiological characteristic related to viability. As a
   result, a vital staining procedure was developed and validated, and it
   was coupled with two rapid quantitative procedures previously assessed,
   therefore, permitting the determination of the total number of helminth
   eggs and, simultaneously, the viable and non-viable fraction. The
   average recovering efficiency of the rapid quantitative methods is 54\%
   for raw wastewater and 77\% for treated wastewater; the staining
   technique for viability is equally reliable (within the 95\% confidence
   limits) as the conventional in vitro procedure; the overall test takes
   from 4 to 6 h to be completed when processing up to four samples at the
   same time, and the cost per sample (for unrecoverable materials) ranges
   from US\$2.50 to \$4.00. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The performance of an alternately operated activated sludge wastewater
   treatment plant (WWTP) has been investigated with respect to six
   phthalates, nonylphenol (NP) and nonylphenol diethoxylate (NPDE) and
   linear alkylbenzene sulphonates (LAS). Samples of raw sewage, primary
   and secondary sludge and treated water were collected during an 8-day
   period in May 1999 and analysed for dissolved and sorbed substances. To
   evaluate the system performance with respect to substance removal
   through biodegradation and sorption to sludge the measured data were
   applied in a model describing the different bioreactors as one single
   reactor, corresponding to the concepts of, e.g. SimpleTreat. The most
   abundant of the investigated phthalates was di-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate
   (DEHP) with a measured mean inlet flow of 240 g/day. Two percent of this
   amount was found in the treated water, 70\% was biodegraded and 28\% was
   found in the sludge. For LAS the mean inlet flow was 20,300 g/day, of
   which less than 1\% was found in the treated water, 84\% was biodegraded
   and 15\% was found in the sludge. The mean inlet flow of NP and NPDE was
   44 and 590 g/day, of which 4\% and 2\% was found in the treated water,
   80\% was biodegraded for both substances, and 16\% and 18\% was found in
   the sludge, respectively. The WWTP removal of the investigated
   substances was thus high compared to other studies of conventional
   activated sludge WWTPs. The simple model set-up presents a strong tool
   for predicting substance removal and system sensitivity related to
   changes in the inlet conditions, such as concentrations and flow.
   Furthermore, it allows the inclusion of complex alternately operated
   WWTPs in risk assessment tools such as e.g. SimpleTreat. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The impact of three process parameters, i.e. ground water velocity,
   oxygen-to-BTX mass ratio, and benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX)
   concentrations on first-order biodegradation kinetics in a pilot-scale
   in situ bioremediation system was assessed. Generally, first-order
   biodegradation coefficients decreased with ground water velocity, and
   increased with hydrogen peroxide dose and BTX concentration. First-order
   biodegradation rate coefficients for benzene, toluene, and o-xylene
   varied from 0.3 to 0.81, 0.24 to 0.72, and 0.21 to 0.63 d(-1),
   respectively. Biomass-specific first-order rate coefficients were
   insensitive to ground water velocity, and decreased with increasing BTX
   concentrations. At 10 mg/l BTX concentration, the specific first-order
   coefficients increased with peroxide dose. However, at the 50 mg/l BTX
   concentration and a peroxide dose of 1020 mg/l, a 30-70\% reduction in
   specific first-order biodegradation coefficients was observed. BTX
   biodegradation kinetics in this pilot-scale system were approximately
   one-to-two orders of magnitude slower than in soil microcosms and mixed
   culture bioreactors, and about 200-300\% higher than full-scale systems.

Abstract = {{This study is to establish optimal conditions for the minimization of
   iron sludge produced in Fenton oxidation processes by
   electro-regenerating Fe2+ with constant potential (CPM) or constant
   current mode (CCM). Results indicate that the optimal cathodic potential
   for Fe2+ regeneration is -0.1 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode
   (SCE) in terms of current efficiency. Keeping the initial Fe3+
   concentration ({[}Fe3+](0)) constant, the average current density
   produced at -0.1 V vs. SCE (CPM) is approximately equal to the optimal
   current density applied in the CCM. The suitable pH range is below the
   pH value determined by Fe3+ hydrolysis. As expected, increasing cathode
   surface area and solution temperature notably increases Fe2+
   regeneration rate. At the optimal potential, the average current density
   increases linearly with {[}Fe3+](0), exhibiting a slope of 8.48 x 10(-3)
   (A/m(2))(mg/L)(-1). The average current efficiency varies with
   {[}Fe3+](0), e.g., 75\% and 96-98\% at 100 and greater than or equal to
   500mg/L {[}Fe3+](0), respectively. Once reaching 75\% of Fe2+
   regeneration capacity, further regeneration becomes difficult due to
   Fe3+ mass transfer limitation. Fe2+ can also be effectively regenerated
   by dissolving iron sludge at low pH (usually less than or equal to 1).
   The unit energy consumption is 2.0-3.0 kW h per kg Fe2+ regenerated. (C)

Abstract = {{Groundwater samples were taken from seven bore holes at depths ranging
   from 2 to 41 m nearby drinking water pumping station Vierlingsbeek, The
   Netherlands and analysed for Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu.
   Shale-normalized patterns were generally flat and showed that the
   observed rare earth elements (REE) were probably of natural origin. In
   the shallow groundwaters the REEs were light REE (LREE) enriched,
   probably caused by binding of LREEs to colloids. To improve
   understanding of the behaviour of the REE, two approaches were used:
   calculations of the speciation and a statistical approach.
   For the speciation calculations, complexation and precipitation
   reactions including inorganic and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   compounds, were taken into account. The REE speciation showed REE3+,
   REE(SO4)(+), REE(CO3)(+) and REE(DOC) being the major species.
   Dissolution of pure REE precipitates and REE-enriched solid phases did
   not account for the observed REEs in groundwater. Regulation of REE
   concentrations by adsorption-desorption processes to Fe(III)(OH)(3) and
   Al(OH)(3) minerals, which were calculated to be present in nearly all
   groundwaters, is a probable explanation.
   The statistical approach (multiple linear regression) showed that pH is
   by far the most significant groundwater characteristic which contributes
   to the variation in REE concentrations. Also DOC, SO4, Fe and Al
   contributed significantly, although to a much lesser extent, to the
   variation in REE concentrations. This is in line with the calculated
   REE-species in solution and REE-adsorption to iron and aluminium
   (hydr)oxides. Regression equations including only pH, were derived to
   predict REE concentrations in groundwater. External validation showed
   that these regression equations were reasonably successful to predict
   REE concentrations of groundwater of another drinking water pumping
   station in quite different region of The Netherlands. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effects of ageing and of phosphate load on drinking water biofilms
   developed on a polycarbonate substratum in the pseudo-equilibrium state
   have been evaluated. Phosphate was added in an amount higher than the
   stochiometric nutrient requirements of bacteria, at concentrations
   commonly applied in a drinking water distribution system for corrosion
   control.
   Multiple parameters were monitored: heterotrophic plate counts (HPCs),
   total direct counts (TDCs) and potential exoproteolytic activity (PEPA)
   in order to characterise changes in bacterial biofilms. The total
   carbohydrate, amino acid and phosphate contents of biofilms were
   analysed to characterise and monitor the biochemical composition of the
   biofilm.
   The three enumeration methods showed that a pseudo-equilibrium state was
   reached after 7 weeks of colonisation after which, the bacterial growth
   rate in the biofilm was 0.1 log per week on average. Bulk phosphate
   addition doubled the phosphate in the biofilm, but did not affect the
   other biological, physiological or chemical parameters measured.
   Polysaccharides increased in the biofilm with ageing and the dynamics of
   individual carbohydrate synthesis also varied with the age of the
   biofilm. Once pseudo-equilibrium, it was found that the total proteins
   were globally constant, whereas the spectra of some individual amino
   acids of the proteins had significantly changed. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Laboratories responsible for Legionella diagnostics around the world use
   a number of different culturing methods of non-equivalent sensitivities
   and specificities, to detect Legionella species in environmental
   samples. Specific countries usually standardize and use one approved
   method. For example, laboratories in Australia use the Australian
   Standard (AS) method and those in Europe, the International Standard
   method (ISO). However, no standard culturing methods have been
   established in South Africa to date. As a result, there is uncertainty
   about the true prevalence and most common species of Legionella present
   in the South African environment. In an attempt to provide guidelines
   for the development of a standard method specific for South Africa, the
   ISO, AS and a most probable number method were evaluated and compared.
   In addition, the effect of sample re-incubation with autochthonous
   amoebae on culture outcome was studied. Samples were collected from four
   environments, representing industrial water, mine water and biofilm. The
   samples were concentrated by membrane filtration and divided into three
   portions and cultured without pretreatment, after acid treatment and
   after heat treatment, on four culture media namely alphaBCYE, BMPA, MWY
   and GVPC agar. A selective approach, incorporating heat treatment, but
   not acid treatment, combined with culture on alphaBCYE and GVPC or MWY,
   was most appropriate for legionellae detection in the samples evaluated.
   Legionellae were cultured from 82\% of the environmental samples we
   evaluated. In 54\% of the samples tested, legionellae were present in
   numbers equal to or exceeding 10(2) colony-forming units per milliliter
   (cfu/ml). Legionella pneumophila serogroups (SGs) 1-14 were the most
   prevalent species and were present as single, or a combination of two or
   more SGs in a number of samples tested. Re-incubation of sample
   concentrates with autochthonous amoebae improved the culturability of
   legionellae in 50\% of cultures on aBCYE and 25\% on GVPC. (C) 2003

Title = {{Nitrification with high nitrite accumulation for the treatment of
   wastewater with high ammonia concentration}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1371-1377}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this paper was to determine the best conditions for
   partial nitrification with nitrite accumulation of simulated industrial
   wastewater with high ammonia concentration, lowering the total oxygen
   needed in the nitrification step, which may mean great saving in
   aeration. Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and pH were selected as
   operational parameters to study the possibility of nitrite accumulation
   not affecting overall ammonia removal. A 2.5 L activated sludge reactor
   was operated in nitrification mode, feeding a synthetic wastewater
   simulating an industrial wastewater with high ammonia concentration.
   During the start-up a pH of 7.85 and a DO of 5.5 mg/L were used. The
   reactor was operated until stable operation was achieved at final
   nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 3.3 kg N- NH4+/m(3) with an influent
   ammonia concentration of 610mg N-NH4+/L.
   The influence of pH was studied in continuous operation in the range of
   6.15-9.05, changing the reactor pH in steps until ammonia accumulation
   (complete nitrification inhibition) took place. The influence of DO was
   studied in the same mode, changing the DO in steps from 5.5 to 0.5 mg/L.
   The pH was not a useful operational parameter in order to accumulate
   nitrite, because in the range of pH 6.45-8.95 complete nitrification to
   nitrate occurs. At pH lower than 6.45 and higher than 8.95 complete
   inhibition of nitrification takes place. Setting DO concentration in the
   reactor at 0.7 mg/L, it was possible to accumulate more than 65\% of the
   loaded ammonia nitrogen as nitrite with a 98\% ammonia conversion. Below
   0.5 mg/L of DO ammonia was accumulated and over a DO of 1.7 mg/L
   complete nitrification to nitrate was achieved.
   In conclusion, it is possible under the conditions of this study, to
   treat high ammonia synthetic wastewater achieving an accumulation of at
   least 65\% of the loaded nitrogen as nitrite, operating at a DO around
   0.7 mg/L. This represents a reduction close to 20\% in the oxygen
   necessary, and therefore a considerable saving in aeration. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Kinetics of simultaneous iron and 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) oxidation
   by groundwater enriched cultures were studied in order to reveal the
   competition for oxygen in aerobic in situ bioremediation of boreal
   groundwater. Chemical iron oxidation at near neutral pH in synthetic
   groundwater depended by the first order on the concentrations of ferrous
   iron and dissolved oxygen and by the second order on pH. The chemical
   iron oxidation rate constant was on average 2.2 x 10(13) mol(-2) L 2
   atm(-1) min(-1). Chemical iron oxidation was insignificantly affected by
   natural organic matter, 2,4,6-tri-, 2,3,4,6-tetra- or pentachlorophenol
   in groundwater. Biological oxidation of iron followed zero-order
   kinetics. At pH of 6.3 and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of 11.5
   mg L-1, the rate of biological iron oxidation was 3.8 x 10(-4) mmol L-1
   min(-1) and up to one order of magnitude higher than the chemical
   oxidation rate, 5.2 x 10(-6) mmol L-1 min(-1). Biological oxidation of
   iron was completely inhibited by pentachlorophenol at 23 mumol(-1). With
   a groundwater enriched culture, oxygen was consumed at higher rates. by
   2,4,6-TCP oxidizers (2.5 - 7.6 x 10(-5) mmol DO L-1 min(-1)) than the
   iron oxidizing bacteria (0.8 - 3.1 X 10(-5) mmol DO L-1 min(-1)) at both
   low and saturated DO-concentrations. The results indicate that in situ
   iron oxidation is predominantly biogenic in the studied boreal aquifer.
   2,4,6-TCP degrading bacteria consumed DO at higher rates than the iron
   oxidizing bacteria and thereby, favour bioremediation of the
   polychlorophenol contaminated groundwater. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) concentrations were measured at
   different stages in a full-scale sewage treatment plant (STP) and mass
   balances were calculated. The DEHP load to treatment process coming from
   the sewer system and the internal load comprising returned supernatants
   and filtrate from sludge treatment and excess secondary sludge were at
   the same level. The DEHP removal efficiency from the water phase at the
   STP was on average 94\% of sewage DEHP, the main removal process being
   sorption to primary and secondary sludges. On average 29\% of DEHP was
   calculated to be removed in the biological nitrifying-denitrifying
   activated sludge process, which was much less than expected from
   laboratory biodegradation studies described in literature.
   Monoethylhexyl plithalate, the primary biotransformation product of
   DEHP, was not detected at any treatment stage. Approximately 32\% of
   DEHP in sewage was removed during anaerobic digestion of the sludge,
   while 32\% remained in the digested and dewatered sludge. (C) 2003

Title = {{Estimating sludge loadings to land based on trace metal sorption in
   soil: effect of dissolved organo-metallic complexes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the results of research examining the effect of
   dissolved organo-metallic complexes of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) from
   sewage sludge leachate on sorption by a humic-gley soil A-horizon, and
   the influence of such complexes on resultant sludge loading estimates.
   Sorption was described with Linear, Freundlich or Laugmuir equations,
   and compared between a sample of sludge leachate (containing 97.4\% of
   Cu and 63.2\% of Zn as dissolved organo-metallic complexes) and a
   reference solution (which mimicked the leachate, except for a lack of
   dissolved organic material). This comparison revealed that dissolved
   organo-metallic complexes significantly depressed Cu and Zn sorption in
   the study soil. The isotherm equations were then used to estimate
   sludge-derived Cu and Zn loadings to soil in order to result in an
   ``allowable{''} output concentration from the soil solution to the
   surrounding environment. These loadings, together with soil bulk density
   and ``availability{''} of sludge Cu and Zn, were incorporated in a
   preliminary model to estimate sludge application rates which are
   acceptable in terms of off-site movement of these metals through
   leaching losses. In the absence of dissolved organo-metallic complexes
   (sorption from the reference solution), levels of Cu and Zn sorption in
   the study soil indicated a sludge application rate of approximately 3500
   kg/ha. However, when Cu and Zn sorption from the sludge leachate with
   dissolved organo-metallic complexes was considered, calculated loading
   rates were reduced to approximately 690 kg-sludge/ha. This suggests that
   for sludge loading estimates based on soil sorption characteristics to
   be relevant to environmental protection, the sorption depressing effect
   of dissolved organo-metallic complexes should be quantitatively
   considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An indicator model for evaluating trends in river quality using a
   two-stage fuzzy set theory to condense efficiently monitoring data is
   proposed. This candidate data reduction method uses fuzzy set theory in
   two analysis stages and constructs two different kinds of membership
   degree functions to produce an aggregate indicator of water quality.
   First, membership functions of the standard River pollution index (RPI)
   indicators, DO, BOD5, SS, and NH3-N are constructed as piecewise linear
   distributions on the interval {[}0, 1], with the critical variables
   normalized in four degrees of membership (0, 0.33, 0.67 and 1). The
   extension of the convergence of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) methodology is
   then used to construct a second membership set from the same normalized
   variables as used in the RPI estimations. Weighted sums of the
   similarity degrees derived from the extensions of FCM are used to
   construct an alternate overall index, the River quality index (RQI). The
   RQI provides for more logical analysis of disparate surveillance data
   than the RPI, resulting in a more systematic, less ambiguous approach to
   data integration and interpretation. In addition, this proposed
   alternative provides a more sensitive indication of changes in quality
   than the RPI. Finally, a case study of the Keeling River is presented to
   illustrate the application and advantages of the RQI. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Field and laboratory studies were conducted to elucidate the design
   factors and mechanisms of arsenic removal from contaminated ground water
   using zero-valent iron. Large scale, field pilot experiments
   demonstrated for more than 8 months that iron filing alters can
   efficiently remove arsenite from aqueous solutions to levels less than
   10 mug/L. The maximum arsenic accumulation measured was 4.4 mg As/g of
   media. The iron filing filters leached significant quantities of iron
   (73\% of the iron was leached). A critical design parameter of the
   system was found to be the hydraulic detention time of the water in the
   filter. TCLP analyses of the spent media indicated that the arsenic
   concentration in the leachate was two orders of magnitude lower than the
   5 mg/L of TCLP for arsenic. Spectroscopic and laboratory arsenic
   leaching studies (alkaline extraction and TCLP) suggest that the arsenic
   surface precipitate is related to sulfur. The aging process (due to the
   longevity of the removal mechanism) makes-the precipitation process
   virtually irreversible. A mathematical model was developed to simulate
   the removal process using a partitioning coefficient and a mass transfer
   process. Calibration of these parameters using the data for three
   columns revealed that the equilibrium-partitioning coefficient was the
   same for all three columns while the mass transfer coefficient was a
   function of the flow rate. The calibrated mass transfer coefficients are
   similar to those reported in the literature if they are normalized to
   the surface area of the media. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A study of historical P inputs to Friary Lough, Co. Tyrone, Northern
   Ireland used a multi-sediment core approach. One of the sediment cores
   taken from the littoral zone at 2.5 rn water depth showed exceptionally
   high P, Fe and Mn concentrations below 20 cm sediment depth.
   Concentrations increased to 14 mg P g(-1), 238 mg Fe g(-1) and 35 mg Mn
   g(-1) in the sediment profile and compared with deep basin maxima of 7
   mg P g(-1), 70 mg Fe g(-1) and 2 mg Mn g(-1) in surface sediments at 8.5
   rn water depth. It is proposed that the high concentrations in the
   littoral zone core are due to post-depositional intrusion of
   chemical-rich local groundwater from soils in adjacent fields that are
   excessively fertilised with organic slurry. Soil analyses showed Olsen-P
   concentrations in these fields up to 125 mg kg(-1) at the soil surface
   (0-7.5 cm) and 39 mg kg(-1) in the sub-soil at 20 cm. depth. We suggest
   that the mobilisation of P, Fe and Mn is due to leaching following P
   saturation and/or the loss of P absorbing chemicals due to prolonged
   reduction and complexing in wet soils. Further work will explore this
   relationship and the nature of the hydrological pathways through soil.

Abstract = {{In the City of Karlsruhe/Germany anaerobic digestion of 7200 t a(-1) of
   separately collected biowaste has proven its feasibility at an organic
   loading rate (OLR) of up to 8.5 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). An extension of
   biowaste collection over the whole city area would increase the amount
   of biowaste to 12,000 t a(-1), leading to an OLR of the existing
   anaerobic reactor of up to 15 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). To test, whether the
   increased amount of biowaste could be stabilized in the existing plant,
   biowaste suspensions were digested in a laboratory reactor at a maximum
   OLR, that exceeded the future OLR of the full-scale plant.
   The laboratory reactor was started with effluent of the full-scale
   biowaste digester. Like in full-scale, biowaste suspension from the
   hydropulper was added in a fed-batch mode. The elimination of organic
   material (measured as COD, chemical oxygen demand) and the volumetric
   gas production were linearly increasing with the OLR from 4.3 to 19 kg
   COD m(-3) d(-1). Thus, safe operation of the full-scale plant at an OLR
   of 15 kg COD m(-3) d(-1) should be possible, leaving still some reserve
   capacity.
   To determine the metabolic reserves for fatty acid degradation during
   digestion at an OLR of 10 kg COD m(-3) d(-1), digester effluent was
   supplemented with either 40 mmol l(-1) acetate, propionate, i-butyrate
   or n-butyrate. Results of these batch assays indicated a rapid
   degradation of all fatty acids and fatty acid conversion rates, that
   would allow a stable anaerobic fermentation at 15 kg COD m(-3) d(-1)
   OLR.
   On the basis of the laboratory results the OLR of the full-scale methane
   reactor was increased to 15 kg COD m(-3) d(-1). After 7 months, results
   of full-scale digestion were still consistent with the previously
   obtained laboratory results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Previous studies of an industrial effluent have indicated toxic effects
   by the ammonium/water system in tests with the unicellular green alga,
   Nephroselmispyriformis. This investigation was undertaken to determine
   the toxicity of ammonia to this alga, and to identify the dominant
   toxicant in an industrial process effluent. The algal standard test was
   modified to improve the pH control, i.e. by testing at shorter exposure
   time and in the presence of a buffering agent, 3 mM HEPES. Ammonia was
   found to be the predominant toxic form in the dissociating
   ammonium/water system and the specific toxicity of ammonia (EC50, 24 h
   exposure) was 2.34 muM (32.8 mug ammonia nitrogen/L). Due to the
   dissociation, the toxicity is strongly pH dependent. Joint toxicity with
   additive effects of ammonia and ammonium ions was indicated, but the
   toxicity of ammonium ions was almost a factor 100 less (EC50, 24 h
   exposure, 224 muM or 3140 mug ammonium-nitrogen/L). According to the
   results the EC50 for effect on growth rate of N. pyriformis in seawater
   of pH 8.0 is 71 muM total ammonium. Hence, this alga appears to be more
   sensitive to ammonia than other studied marine plankton algae. Ammonia
   was found to be the dominant toxicant in the industrial effluent, using
   N. pyriformis as test organism. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effect of degradation of polymeric substrates (starch and soy
   proteins mixture) on the structure of biofilms has been studied. The
   characteristics of the obtained biofilms were compared to those obtained
   on corresponding monomeric substrates (glucose and aspartic acid). Based
   on literature suggestions it was hypothesized that the polymeric
   substrates, which have a low diffusion rate in the biofilm matrix, would
   affect the biofilm structure if hydrolytic activity occurs in the
   biofilm. The obtained biofilm could be expected to present properties
   like low density and rough surface, facilitating transport and
   conversion of large polymeric molecules. From the present study it was
   concluded that the structure of the formed biofilms was influenced by
   the substrate degraded, however no unequivocal effect of degradation of
   a polymer on the biofilm structure could be observed. The hydrolytic
   activity with soy protein and starch as substrate was under stable
   conditions found to be mainly associated to the biofilm (more than 95\%
   of the total activity). During unstable conditions or start-up
   significant hydrolytic activity occurred outside the biofilm. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The effects of discontinuous chlorination on the characteristics of the
   water in a pilot drinking water distribution network were investigated.
   The release or consumption of organic matter (as dissolved organic
   carbon, DOC) following chlorination and non-chlorination periods were
   estimated, as were changes in bacterial cell production. In each
   unchlorinated network 0.3 mg DOCl-1 was consumed and the average cell
   production was approximately 1.3 x 10(5) cells ml(-1). In discontinously
   chlorinated networks (chlorine treatment: 3.3 mgCl(2)l(-1), chlorine
   residual: 0-1 mg Cl(2)l(-1)) the DOC release (DOCout-DOCin) was between
   0.1 and 0.2 mg Cl-1. Biomass production (cells(out)-cells(in)) during
   this chlorination period was lower (approximately 2 x 10(4) cells
   ml(-1)). The delay before DOC was released in chlorinated networks
   appeared to be less than 24h, which corresponds to one hydraulic
   residence time. Likewise, when chlorination was stopped, 24 h or less
   were required before an efficient DOC removal was resumed. When
   chlorination was prolonged the observed release of DOC was progressively
   reduced from 0.2 mg l(-1) to zero, thus after 6 weeks of continuous
   chlorination the DOCin was equivalent to the DOCout. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   first was located in the upper region (ambient control), and the others
   downstream of the confluences of nine principal tributaries. The two
   sampling programs were paralleled by contemporary investigations on the
   macroinvertebrate community. The particle-size composition along the Po
   River showed a relatively uniform distribution of fine sand, a
   progressive downstream decrease of coarse sands and a corresponding
   increase of fine materials. The levels of polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCB), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), extractable organo
   halides (EOX), Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn were determined in sediment
   fine particles (< 63 mum), and showed marked changes across the ten
   river reaches. Their longitudinal trends, as those of organic carbon and
   total nitrogen, were very similar and largely independent of the survey
   season. Sediment quality benchmarks were used to evaluate sediment
   chemistry, and, although the overall level of contamination was from
   moderate to low, the reaches located downstream of the tributaries Dora
   Riparia, Dora Baltea, Lambro and Oglio were considered to be at risk.
   Sediments were tested for toxicity on Oncorhynchus mykiss, Ceriodaphnia
   dubia, Raphidocelis subcapitata and Vibrio fischeri. The toxicity tests
   were conducted both with sediment extracts and whole samples. Sediment
   extracts showed toxic potentials that were consistent with the spatial
   distribution of contaminants. Whole-sediment toxicity showed
   moderate/low effects which also included false positives and negatives.
   Alterations of the macroinvertebrate community were found for many
   kilometers downstream of Dora Riparia, and with a seasonal dependence,
   also in other reaches of the Italian river. Principal component analysis
   (PCA) was used to describe the longitudinal and temporal changes of the
   Po River, and allowed the selection of the most useful and
   discriminating indicators. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Adhesion of Pseudomonas sp. NCIMB 2021 was tested on different non-solid
   hydrogel surfaces under different shear conditions. Gels consisting of
   alginate (highly anionic), chitosan (highly cationic), modified
   polyvinyl alcohol PVA-SbQ (very low cationic) and agarose (neutral) were
   casted in moulds custom-made for a rotating annular biofilm reactor.
   Cells were stained with SYBR R Green I nucleic acid gel stain, and
   images were collected using a confocal laser scanning microscope.
   Relative adhesion was quantified by determining percent cell coverage
   using image analysis. Bacterial adhesion on gels decreased at higher
   shear rates. At low shear rates, adhesion varied significantly between
   different gels, in the following descending order: alginate > agarose >
   chitosan > PVA-SbQ. Only adhesion to alginate remained significantly
   higher than to the others at high shear rates. Lowest cell coverage at
   all shear rates was recorded on PVA-SbQ gels. Clearly, the macroscopic
   hydrophobicity of the hydrogel surfaces did not enhance adhesion as
   observed for solid surfaces. A 5\% PVA-SbQ gel showed the most promising
   antifouling properties. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biofouling is a serious problem in industrial recirculating cooling
   systems. It damages equipment, through biocorrosion, and causes clogging
   and increased energy consumption, through decreased heat transfer. In
   this research a fixed-bed biofilter was developed which removed
   assimilable organic carbon (AOC) from process water, thus limiting the
   major substrate for the growth of biofouling. The biofilter was tested
   in a laboratory model recirculating cooling water system, including a
   heat exchanger and a cooling tower. A second identical model system
   without a biofilter served as a reference. Both installations were
   challenged with organic carbon (sucrose and yeast extract) to provoke
   biofouling. The biofilter improved the quality of the recirculating
   cooling water by reducing the AOC content, the ATP concentration,
   bacterial numbers (30-40 fold) and the turbidity (OD660). The process of
   biofouling in the heat exchangers, the process water pipelines and the
   cooling towers, was monitored by protein increase, heat transfer
   resistance, and chlorine demanded for maintenance. This revealed that
   biofouling was lower in the system with the biofilter compared to the
   reference installation. It was concluded that AOC removal through
   biofiltration provides an attractive, environmental-friendly means to
   reduce biofouling in industrial cooling systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of surface water acidification on rates of
   decomposition, ergosterol concentrations (as a measure of fungal
   biomass), and palatability to shredders of common beech leaves (Fugus
   sylvatica L.) in five mountain streams (pH 4.7-7.1). Leaf decomposition
   was significantly faster in the circumneutral streams (pH 6.4-7.1;
   kgreater than or equal to0.00175 d(-1)), when compared to acidic streams
   (pH 4.7-4.9; kless than or equal to0.00100 d(-1)). Fungal biomass showed
   no particular trend along the acidification gradient except that it
   peaked earlier in the stream closest to neutrality. Leaf palatability,
   measured as the feeding activity of the leaf-shredding amphipod Gammarus
   fossarum Koch, varied with the exposure time in the streams. Except for
   the higher palatability of leaves exposed during 6 weeks at the highest
   pH, patterns among streams were mostly similar. These results suggest
   that reduced processing rates in the most acidic streams were not
   related to differences in fungal biomass associated with decomposing
   leaves and that microbial conditioning was only slightly delayed by
   acidification. Possible effects of low pH and related variables (Ca, Al)
   on microbial decomposition and detritivorous macroinvertebrates are
   discussed to clarify the inhibition of beech leaf decomposition in the
   studied systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Treatment of atrazine in nursery irrigation runoff by a constructed
   wetland}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{539-550}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{To investigate the treatment capability of a surface flow wetland at a
   container nursery near Portland, Oregon, atrazine was introduced during
   simulated runoff events. Treatment efficiency was evaluated as the
   percent atrazine recovered (as percent of applied) in the water column
   at the wetland's outlet. Atrazine treatment efficiency at the outlet of
   the constructed wetland during a 7-d period ranged from 18-24\% in 1998
   (experiments 1-3) and 16-17\% in 1999 (experiments 4 and 5). Changes in
   total flow, or frequency and intensity of runoff events did not affect
   treatment. For experiment 6 in 1999, where the amount, frequency, and
   duration of runoff events exceeded all other experiments, treatment was
   compromised. For all experiments, deethylatrazine (DEA) and
   deisopropylatrazine (DIA) accounted for 13-21\% of the initial
   application. Hydroxyatrazine (HA) was rarely detected in the water.
   Organic carbon adsorption coefficients (K(oc)) were determined from
   batch equilibrium sorption isotherms with wetland sediment, and they
   decreased in the order of HA > DIA > atrazine > DEA. Static
   water-sediment column experiments indicated that sorption is an
   important mechanism for atrazine loss from water passing through the
   constructed wetland. The results of the MPN assay indicated the
   existence in the wetland of a low-density population of microorganisms
   with the potential to mineralize atrazine's ethyl side chain. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The anaerobic microbial and photochemical degradation pathways of
   4,4'-dibromodiphenyl ether (BDE15) were examined. BDE15 was reductively
   debrominated within a fixed-film plug-flow biological reactor at
   hydraulic retention times of 3.4 and 6.8 h, leading to exclusive
   production of 4-bromodiphenyl ether (BDE3) and diphenyl ether (DE). A
   suite of potential BDE15 metabolites arising from reductive
   debromination, hydroxylation, and methoxylation of the aromatic C-Br and
   C-H bonds were not observed. Following initial debromination of BDE 15,
   degradation of BDE3 to DE readily occurs, suggesting the rate-limiting
   step for anaerobic BDE15 degradation is conversion of BDE15 to BDE3. The
   photochemical degradation of BDE15 was also examined in organic (CH3CN
   and CH3OH) and aqueous (H2O:CH3CN; 1:1 v/v) solvent systems at 300 nm.
   Only photochernically induced reductive debromination was found to occur
   via homolytic C-Br bond cleavage, with no evidence of C-O bond cleavage
   or products arising from heterolytic bond cleavage. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida 5-x with high Cu2+
   accumulating capability was isolated from electroplating effluent in
   Kwun Tong, Hong Kong. The pretreated cells without superficial
   layer-capsule, isolated cell envelopes and the separated peptidoglycan
   layer materials were obtained from fresh P. putida 5-x cells, their Cu2+
   adsorption capacities and properties were compared with that of the
   fresh cells. Pretreatment by 0.1 mol L-1 HCl enhanced Cu2+ adsorption
   capacity due to the degradation of cell superficial layer-capsule of P.
   putida 5-x cells. Isolated cell envelopes possessed five times more Cu2+
   adsorption capacity than that of fresh intact cell. The Cu2+ adsorption
   of separated peptidoglycan layer materials indicated that the
   peptidoglycan layer only played 10-15\% part of the Cu2+ adsorption
   capacity, and implied other cell surface components such as outer
   membrane or inner membrane might play an important role in such high
   Cu2+ binding of the cell envelopes. The adsorption process of fresh
   cells, pretreated cells and cell envelopes of P. putida 5-x could be
   described with Freundlich isotherm, while the adsorption of Cu2+ by
   separated peptidoglycan layer materials was better described with
   Langmuir isotherm. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient retention due to sedimentation in running waters has been
   little studied. The knowledge about the processes of self-purification
   is important for the management of rivers. The principal aim of our
   investigations was to quantify nutrient retention by sedimentation
   within and adjacent to stands of submerged macrophytes. In addition, we
   examined the relationship between deposition and sedimentation patterns
   and the flow regime.
   In the summer of 2001, investigations were performed in the lower River
   Spree with sediment traps and sediment cores and measurement of flow
   velocities. The spatial distribution of macrophytes was described and
   related to sedimentation and flow patterns. Water and sediment samples
   were analysed for total phosphorus and total organic nitrogen
   concentrations.
   Macrophytes significantly enhanced water residence time by factors
   between 2 and 18. Trapping rates were high within and downstream of
   macrophyte stands due to the prevailing quiescent conditions. Trapping
   rates were low in regions not covered by macrophytes, where
   flow,velocities were high. Calculated deposition of organic matter due
   to trapping rates accounted for 15-49\% of observed deposition between
   May and September, the vegetation period. The difference between
   calculated and observed deposition can partly be attributed to an
   incomplete erosion of the organic sediments between October and April.
   Between May and September, nitrogen and phosphorus were retained by
   deposition by as much as 2.5\% and 12.2\%, respectively (\% of total
   load).
   Therefore, macrophytes considerably contributed to total monthly
   phosphorus retention (up to 25\%) by increasing deposition of
   particulate organic matter. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that the sodium salt of
   1,3-benzenediamidoethanethiol (BDET) is both economical and effective in
   precipitating mercury and other heavy metals from water. Because
   wastewaters and contaminated natural waters may contain a variety of
   heavy metals, it is important to determine how different heavy metals
   may interact with BDET, and whether free metals may displace those that
   are bound. To explore this possibility, Cd-, Cu-, Pb-, Mn-, Hg- and
   Zn-BDET were leached separately under a nitrogen purge for up to 240 h
   in pH 3 aqueous solutions containing 0.100 mmol of all five heavy
   metals. The leaching studies indicate that dissolved Hg has a strong
   tendency to displace Cd, Cu, Mn, Pb, and Zn from the BDET structure. (C)

   lagoons or marshes can also be a source of high indicator organism
   concentrations in coastal waters. We asked for a Mediterranean-type
   climate, what is the fate of runoff-associated FC through a coastal
   lagoon? To address this question, we developed a mass balance-based,
   mechanistic model of FC concentration through a coastal lagoon and
   simulated, for summer and winter conditions, FC within the lagoon water
   column, lagoon sediments, and in the ocean water just downstream of the
   lagoon mouth. Our model accounts for advective flow and dispersion,
   decay and sedimentation and resuspension of FC-laden sediments during
   high flow, erosional conditions. Under low flow conditions that occur in
   the summer, net FC decay and FC storage in lagoon sediments are
   predicted. Under high flow conditions that occur in the winter, FC-laden
   sediments are predicted to erode, resuspend and flow out of the lagoon
   where they elevate FC concentrations in the coastal ocean. For both
   seasonal conditions, the predicted water column FC concentrations were
   within an order of magnitude of field measurements for a reference site
   in southern California. Our results suggest that there are seasonally
   varying roles for coastal lagoons in mediating FC contamination to
   coastal waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Leachates from 17 different landfills in Europe were, analysed with
   respect to phthalates, i.e. phthalic acid diesters (PAEs) and their
   degradation products phthalic acid monoesters (PMEs) and ortho-phthalic
   acid (PA). Diesters are ubiquitous and the human possible exposure and
   potential to human health and environment has put them in focus. The aim
   of this study was to elucidate whether monoesters and phthalic acid
   could be traced in landfill leachates and in what concentrations they
   may be found. The results showed that phthalates were present in the
   majority of the leachates investigated. The monoesters appeared from 1
   to 20 mug/L and phthalic acid 2-880 mug/L (one divergent value of 19 mg
   phthalic acid/L). Their parental diesters were observed from I to 460
   mug/L. These observed occurrences of degradation products, of all
   diesters studied, support that they are degraded under the landfill
   conditions covered by this study. Thus, we have presented strong
   evidences to conclude that microorganisms in landfills degrade diesters
   released from formulations in a variety of products, including polyvinyl
   chloride (PVC) species. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Toxicity to organisms is usually expressed in terms of an observable
   effect on individuals from which a summary endpoint (such as the NOEC or
   ECx) is derived for risk assessment and environmental quality standards.
   However, toxicity evaluated in terms of a demographic endpoint may be
   more relevant to such regulatory applications. In this paper the effect
   of toxicity on population growth rate r is explored in tandem with a
   `double bootstrap' to incorporate uncertainty. Exemplifying the approach
   with a set of individualized life table response data obtained for
   Daphnia magna exposed to zinc sulphate solution, the influence of
   increasing concentrations is assessed. A demographic-based metric for r,
   the ErCx (effect on r concentration percentage), is defined to permit
   alternative population level estimation of a `safe effect'
   concentration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study was to observe the sludge accumulation
   pattern of an experimental, covered, anaerobic pond treating municipal
   wastewater under Mediterranean climatic conditions throughout a 2-year
   operational period (1999-2000) in order to form a seasonal sludge
   accumulation model which may be used to predict the required desludging
   time, not only of the particular anaerobic pond used in the study, but
   also for other types of anaerobic ponds and operational situations.
   The 4-m deep pond was supplied with pre-screened, untreated wastewater
   from the nearby treatment plant of Thessaloniki, Greece, initially at a
   flow rate of 120 m(3) /day and later at a flow rate of 150 m(3) /day.
   The influent characteristics were BOD5 441 mg O-2/L, COD 942 mg O-2/L
   and suspended solids (SS) 574 mg/L. BOD5, COD, and SS concentrations of
   the pond effluent were reduced by 50\%, 53\%, and 64\%, respectively, in
   comparison with those of the influent.
   During the operational period, three distinctly different zones were
   seen to form within the anaerobic pond: The first zone, which formed at
   the bottom of the pond, consisted of inert, high-density sludge. The
   second zone, which formed above this, contained a high concentration of
   volatile (easily biodegradable) sludge. The third upper zone
   (supernatant), was a liquid layer low in suspended solids.
   The accumulation of sludge in the pond followed an annual sinusoidal
   pattern with high values during winter and low ones during summer due to
   the increased digestion rate. The maximum high-density sludge height
   observed was 0.7m, or 2\% (14 m(3)) of the total pond volume. The
   maximum volatile sludge accumulation reached 3.1 m, or 53\% (300 m(3))
   of the pond volume.
   A seasonal sludge accumulation model, based on the sludge inflow and
   seasonal digestion rates, was used to simulate the annual fluctuation in
   accumulation rate for the local (Mediterranean type) climatic
   conditions. Monthly values of accumulation (or digestion) rate of sludge
   (K-AS) were experimentally estimated at specific mean monthly air
   temperatures and approximated by a regression second degree polynomial
   equation to be used with the model. The predicted desludging interval
   for our experimental pond was 3 years. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The faecal contamination of greywater in a local treatment system at
   Vibyasen, north of Stockholm, Sweden was quantified using faecal
   indicator bacteria and chemical biomarkers. Bacterial indicator
   densities overestimated the faecal load by 100-1000-fold when compared
   to chemical biomarkers. Based on measured levels of coprostanol, the
   faecal load was estimated to be 0.04 g person(-1) day(-1). Prevalence of
   pathogens in the population and the faccal load were used to form the
   basis of a screening-level quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA)
   that was undertaken for rotavirus, Salmonella typhimurium, Campylobacter
   jejuni, Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum. The different
   exposure scenarios simulated-direct contact, irrigation of sport fields
   and groundwater recharge-gave unacceptably high rotavirus risks
   (0.04<P-inf<0.60) despite a low faecal load. The poor reduction of
   somatic coliphages, which were used as a virus model, in the treatment
   was one main reason and additional treatment of the greywater is
   suggested. Somatic coliphages can under extreme circumstances replicate
   in the wastewater treatment system and thereby underestimate the virus
   reduction. An alternative QMRA method based on faecal enterococci
   densities estimated similar risks as for rotavirus. Growth conditions
   for Salmonella in greywater sediments were also investigated and risk
   modelling based on replication in the system increased the probability
   of infection from Salmonella 1000-fold, but it was still lower than the
   risk of a rotavirus infection. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Drinking water contamination by materials, such as cutting oil, used to
   set up pipelines is an uncommon but possible event. This paper describes
   the analytical procedures used to identify the components of that
   contaminant in drinking water. Volatile and semi-volatile chemical
   species, responsible for an unpleasant taste and odour, were recognised
   by solid phase microextraction and GC/MS techniques. Among the volatile
   compounds, the presence of xylenes, bornyl acetate and diphenyl ether
   was confirmed by certificate standards and quantified in the most
   contaminated samples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Mechanisms and models for anaerobic granulation in upflow anaerobic
   sludge blanket reactor}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{661-673}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor has been employed in
   industrial and municipal wastewater treatment for decades. However, the
   long start-up period required for the development of anaerobic granules
   seriously limits the application of this technology. In order to develop
   the strategy for rapid UASB start-up, the mechanisms for anaerobic
   granulation should be understood. This paper attempts to provide a
   up-to-date review on the existing mechanisms and models for anaerobic
   granulation in the UASB reactor, which include inert nuclei model,
   selection pressure model, multi-valence positive ion-bonding model,
   synthetic and natural polymer-bonding model, Capetown's model, spaghetti
   theory, syntrophic microcolony model, multi-layer model, secondary
   minimum adhesion model, local dehydration and hydrophobic interaction
   model, surface tension model, proton translocation-dehydration theory,
   cellular automaton model and cell-to-cell communication model. Based on
   those previous works, a general model for anaerobic granulation is also
   proposed. It is expected that this paper would be helpful for
   researchers to further develop a unified theory for anaerobic
   granulation and technology for expediting the formation of the UASB
   granules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{674-680}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study ultrasound was examined in terms of its effectiveness in
   treating wastewater containing ambroxol and process water from ambroxol
   synthesis. The organic bromine contents of the water samples
   investigated were in the 20-1200 mg l(-1) range.
   Ultrasound is capable to debrominate the ambroxol molecule rendering it
   biologically degradable. The debromination rate increases with the
   ultrasound intensity and the 0.4 order of the organic bromine
   concentration. Temperature and pH have only a small influence. Bromide
   ions reduce the debromination efficiency of the ultrasound. No removal
   of the organic carbon could be observed during ultrasonic treatment.
   The process water from ambroxol syntheses shows higher sonolytical
   debromination rates than the ambroxol model water. After extracting the
   process water with butyl acetate, the debromination reaction of the
   remaining organic bromine is considerably smaller. Argon increases the
   debromination under certain circumstances.
   The specific electric energy requirements for sonolysis vary between 7
   and 920 kWh g(-1) of removed organic bromine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the stochastic properties of human urine production
   in order to assess the potential of combining urine separation with
   waste design. The aim is to provide specific information about the
   dynamics of urine production at a microscopic level for the design and
   the control of the urine waste stream. Based on measured data a
   stochastic model is developed that is capable of providing stochastic
   information on the frequency, timing, and volume of urine releases into
   each single toilet in a catchment. It is then demonstrated in a virtual
   case study that the design of the human wastewater stream in terms of
   urine content can (1) reduce the ammonia peak loads at dry weather flow
   conditions by approx. 30\% (which could effectively substitute the
   expansion of wastewater treatment plants) and (2) reduce the impact of
   combined sewer overflows on the aquatic environment. With respect to the
   latter a reduction of more than 50\% is demonstrated in terms of annual
   urine volume released via the overflow. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The occurrence and removal of salmonellae and faecal indicators in four
   conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTP) were
   investigated. In addition, we tested the efficiency of a semi-technical
   scale biological nutrient removal process and three pilot-scale tertiary
   filtration units in microbial removal. All influent samples collected
   from MWTPs contained salmonellae from 93 to 11000 MPN/100 ml and
   indicator bacteria from about 10(7) to 10(8) CFU/100 ml. The reductions
   in salmonella numbers achieved in full-scale biological-chemical
   wastewater treatment and semi-technical scale biological nutrient
   removal processes were usually between 94\% and virtually 100\% (99.9\%)
   and indicator bacteria reductions between 2 and 3 log units. Microbial
   numbers in MWTP effluents could be modelled as a function of effluent
   residual organic matter, suspended solids and total phosphorus
   concentrations. Pilot-scale tertiary treatment by rapid sand contact
   filter, chemical contact filter and biological-chemical contact filter
   reduced salmonella numbers below the detection limit and faecal coliform
   numbers on average by 99\%, 39\% and 71\%, respectively. A total of 32
   Salmonella serovars were identified among 197 Salmonella isolates from
   municipal wastewaters. Of the isolates, 32\% were resistant to nalidixic
   acid, indicating reduced sensitivity to ciprofloxacin, the drug of
   choice in the treatment of salmonellosis. In addition, 18\% of the
   isolates were multiresistant. Our results, especially antibiotic
   resistant Salmonella strains, indicate that conventional municipal
   wastewater treatment without efficient tertiary treatment, like
   filtration or disinfection, may constitute a risk for public health. (C)

Title = {{Performance of a hybrid reverse osmosis-constructed wetland treatment
   system for brackish oil field produced water}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{705-713}},

Abstract = {{Using constructed wetlands, produced waters from oil fields (i.e.,
   waters that have been in contact with oil in situ) can be treated to
   enhance water quality for irrigation purposes, or subsequent discharge
   to receiving aquatic systems. In produced water containing elevated
   levels of salt (i.e., brackish-produced waters), the ability to decrease
   the conductivity of the produced water may influence potential reuse of
   the water for irrigation purposes. The objectives of this research were
   (1) to determine the efficacy of a pilot-scale hybrid reverse osmosis
   (RO)-constructed wetland system for treatment and reuse of produced
   waters from an oil field, and (2) to assess the quality of treated water
   in terms of physicochemical characteristics and toxicity influencing
   reuse of the water for irrigation or other designated uses.
   Specifically, the performance of the hybrid treatment system was
   examined in terms of outflow water conductivity, total dissolved solids
   (TDS), and toxicity using Ceriodaphnia dubia and Pimephales promelas in
   7-day static/renewal exposure tests. Prior to treatment, significant
   mortality was observed for C dubia and P. promelas exposed for 7 days to
   6.25\% untreated produced water. Following treatment through the hybrid
   system, no significant mortality was observed in C dubia or P. promelas
   exposed to 100\% treated produced water when compared to the control
   organisms. The pilot-scale RO-constructed wetland system effectively
   decreased conductivity by 95\% and TDS by 94\% in the brackish produced
   water tested in this study. Following treatment, the produced water was
   suitable for irrigation or discharge to surface waters. Therefore,
   hybrid RO-constructed wetland treatment systems present a viable
   alternative for treatment and reuse of produced waters from oil fields.

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to examine the potential role to accumulate and
   transform nitrogen and phosphorus of a common wetland type marsh; the
   site is located in a subtropical environment that receives agricultural
   pollutants; Chiricahueto marsh effectively removes N and P from surface
   waters. It is clear that the diagenetic processes are mainly controlled
   by the exponential decomposition of organic matter that takes place at
   the sediment-water interface and in the sedimentary column, under oxic
   and suboxic-anoxic conditions, respectively. Mass balances indicated a
   net sedimentation of 11.3 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and 3.9 g P m(-2) yr(-1),
   which results in an annual regeneration of 1.7g N m(-2) and 0.8 g P
   m(-2) at the sediment-water interface under oxic conditions. A major
   remineralization rate was estimated in 6.4 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and 1.1g P
   m(-2) yr(-1) into the sedimentary column where suboxic to anoxic
   conditions occur by the utilization of nitrate, Fe and Mn as electron
   acceptors. The estimated burial fluxes in the deeper sediments ( > 50
   cm) were 1.5 g N m(-2) yr(-1) and 0.4 g P m(-2) yr(-1). (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The decontamination of synthetic Pb(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Ni(II)
   solutions was investigated, using silica gels chemically modified with
   poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) as sorbents. Two families of sorbents, i.e.
   silica/PEI and crosslinked silica/PEI, were prepared and characterized.
   Then the removal of metal ions from synthetic aqueous solutions was
   studied by static tests. They revealed that the sorption capacities
   depend on the pH, the initial concentration and to some extent on the
   nature of the metal. The recovery of the metal cations from the
   saturated sorbents was possible with diluted acid, only for the
   crosslinked supports. In this case, the regeneration and reuse without
   sorption decrease, was demonstrated. The presence of other cations (as
   Na+, Ca2+) and metals does not affect the sorption capacities. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{The simultaneous determination of trace amounts of endocrine disruptors
   such as bisphenol A (BPA) and its monochloro, dichloro, trichloro and
   tetrachloro derivatives in wastewater has been developed using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Compounds were previously
   extracted from the aqueous samples using a liquid-liquid extraction
   procedure with a mixture of dichloromethane: carbon tetrachloride
   (25/75). After extraction, solvent was removed and a silylation step was
   carried out with NO-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA). The
   silylated compounds were identified and quantified by GC-MS using an
   HP1-MS column. The retention times were 6.64 min for BPA silylated, 7.26
   min for Cl-BPA silylated, 7.99 min for Cl-2-BPA silylated, 8.85 min for
   Cl-3-BPA silylated and 9.95 min for Cl-4-BPA silylated. A clean-up is
   not necessary using SIM mode. Deuterated anthracene (H-2(10)-anthracene)
   was used as an internal standard. The detection limits obtained were
   0.3, 0.6, 2.0, 4.5 and 13.0 ng L-1 for silylated BPA, Cl-BPA, Cl-2-BPA,
   Cl-3-BPA and Cl-4-BPA, respectively. The proposed method was applied
   satisfactory to the determination of these chemicals, in different types
   of wastewater previously spiked with different amounts of these
   chemicals at concentration levels ranging from 0.01 to 2.50 mug L-1 for
   BPA, 0.05-2.50 mug L-1 for Cl-BPA and 0.05-5.00 mug L-1 for Cl-2-BPA,
   Cl-3-BPA and Cl-4-BPA, respectively. The method was validated following
   standard addition methodology. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This work investigated the adsorption of Cu and Pb at the surface of
   gamma-Al2O3 in the presence of fulvic acid to address the significance
   of dissolved organic matters on metal partitioning. Fulyic acid,
   obtained from International Humic Substance Society, represented
   dissolved organic matter. Fulvic acid concentrations employed herein
   were 1, 5, and 10 mg C/L, which simulated the relevant environmental
   conditions. Ion selective electrodes were employed to ascertain free Cu
   and Pb measurements. The maximum adsorption of 10 mg C/L fulvic acid on
   gamma-Al2O3 was 5 x 10(-2) mg C/mg gamma-Al2O3. Fulvic acid promoted Cu
   adsorption in low pH conditions. The effects of fulvic acid on Pb
   adsorption were similar to those of Cu. The conditional stability
   constants of sorbed fulvic acids with Cu and Ph were determined to be in
   the order of 4 to 6 (log K). Cu and Pb species were modeled in
   heterogeneous systems using triple-layer model. Simulation results
   indicated that metal species are dominantly in complexation with fulvic
   acid, both in solution and at the gamma-Al2O3 surface. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Removals of indigenous coliphage and seeded poliovirus type 1 during
   simulated soil-aquifer treatment were evaluated during transport of
   secondary effluent under unsaturated flow conditions in 1-m soil
   columns. Independent variables included soil type (river sand or sandy
   loam) and infiltration rate. Removal of coliphage was in all cases less
   than removal of poliovirus type 1 (strain LSc-2ab), supporting
   contentions that indigenous coliphage can act as a conservative
   indicator of groundwater contamination by viral pathogens of human
   origin. Coliphage retention was significantly more. efficient (p<0.001)
   in the finer-grained sandy loam (93\%) than in sand (76\%). increasing
   reactor detention time from 5 to 20 h increased coliphage attenuation
   from 70\% to 99 \% in a 1-m sand column. There was a significant linear
   correlation (p = 0.012) between log-transformed (fractional) coliphage
   concentration {[}log(C/C-0)] and reactor detention time. Re-mobilization
   of attached coliphage occurred during simulated rainfall using
   low-ionic-strength water. Inhibition of aerobic respiration resulted in
   significantly less efficient coliphage attenuation (P = 0.033),
   suggesting the involvement of aerobic microorganisms in the

Abstract = {{The capacity and mechanism of metal hydroxide sludge in removing azo
   reactive dyes from aqueous solution was investigated with different
   parameters, such as charge amount of dyes, system pH, adsorbent particle
   size, and adsorbent dosage. The three anionic dyes used were CI Reactive
   Red 2, CI Reactive Red 120, and CI Reactive Red 141, increasing in
   number of sulfonic groups, respectively. Only 0.2\%` (w/v) of powdered
   sludge (< 75 mum) achieved color removal from 30 mg l(-1) reactive dye
   solutions within 5min without pH adjustment. The larger the charge
   amount of the dyes, the greater the adsorption (> 90\%) on the metal
   hydroxide sludge. The system pH played a significant role in the
   adsorption on metal hydroxides and formation of dye-metal complexes. The
   optimum system pH for dye adsorption was 8-9 which was close to the
   pH(zpc) of the sludge while the precipitation of dye-metal complexes
   occurred at system pH 2. The maximum adsorption capacity (Qdegrees) of
   the sludge for the reactive dyes was 48-62 mg dye g(-1) adsorbent. The
   Langmuir and Freundlich models showed that the higher charged dyes had a
   higher affinity of adsorption. The smaller particle size and the greater
   amount of adsorbent showed the faster process, due to an increase in
   surface area of adsorbent. Desorption studies elucidated that metal
   hydroxide sludge had a tendency for ion exchange adsorption of
   sulfonated azo reactive dyes. Leaching data showed that the treated
   water was nontoxic at a system pH above 5 or a solution pH above 2. (C)

Abstract = {{Based on the relative adsorbability of natural organic matter (NOM)
   fractions with different molecular weights (MWs), two model compounds,
   poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) (nominal MW = 1800 Dalton) and
   p-dichlorobenzene (DCB), were chosen to study the competitive effect of
   large and small NOM molecules on atrazine adsorption by two powdered
   activated carbons (PACs) with different pore size distributions. Both
   isotherm and kinetic tests of atrazine adsorption were conducted using
   fresh PAC and PAC preloaded with the model compounds. The model
   compounds were found to affect atrazine adsorption through two different
   mechanisms due to their size difference: direct competition for sites by
   p-DCB and pore constriction/blockage by PSS-1.8k. p-DCB was found to
   significantly reduce atrazine adsorption capacity but to have no effect
   on atrazine adsorption kinetics. In contrast, the effect of PSS-1.8k on
   atrazine adsorption capacity was very small. Furthermore, during
   simultaneous adsorption, PSS-1.8k had no effect on atrazine surface
   diffusion. However, preloading PAC with PSS-1.8k lowered the atrazine
   surface diffusion coefficient, D-s, by more than three orders of
   magnitude; D-s decreased with increasing solid phase PSS-1.8k
   concentration. The pore size distribution of the PAC was found to play
   an important role in competitive adsorption. A high mesopore surface
   area could alleviate pore blockage significantly. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this work, an electrically enhanced crossflow microfiltration (EECMF)
   system was used for the treatment of oxide-CMP wastewater under
   different operating conditions to investigate their effects on
   filtration rate. Oxide-CMP wastewater was obtained from a wafer fab and
   characterized by various standard methods. A membrane with a cut size of
   0.1mum was used in the EECMF system. Operating parameters studied
   include crossflow velocity, transmembrane pressure, mode of electric
   field, electric field strength, and mode of backwashing. The filtration
   rate was found to increase with increasing crossflow velocity, electric
   field strength, and transmembrane pressure when operated below the
   critical electric field strength. Experimental results indicated that
   intra-filtration-run backwashing outperformed inter-filtration-run
   backwashing in terms of filtration rate. Experimental results also
   showed that the filtration rate for pulsed mode operation was greater
   than that of no electric field application, but worse than that of
   continuous mode operation. Using the present EECMF system, a fairly good
   quality of filtrate was obtained. It was found that the filtrate having
   a turbidity of 0.39 NTU is achievable. Thus, the filtrate could be
   reused for non-process applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

   400-2500 mg/L and oxygen pressure of 0.5 or 1.0 MPa, the optimal
   catalyst loading was 1.0 g/L, while it was 2.0 g/L at an oxygen pressure
   of 1.5 MPa. With a phenol concentration of 5000 mg/L, the optimal
   loading was 2.0 g/L for all oxygen pressures tested. Catalyst loading
   influences the reaction via the free-radical chain reaction involved in
   the catalytic wet air oxidation of phenol. Regarding oxygen pressures,
   at a phenol concentration of 400 mg/L, the influence of the tested
   pressures.(0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 MPa) on the 3 h conversion of phenol was
   negligible, while the effect was significant for higher concentrations
   of phenol. The effect of oxygen pressure on TOC conversion was more
   profound, especially at a higher phenol concentration. At a pressure of
   0.5 MPa, except for concentration of 400 mg/L, the CO2 selectivity
   barely exceed 80\% at best, and was less than 25\% with a phenol
   concentration of 5000 mg/L. At, a pressure of 1.5 MPa, the selectivity
   was as high as 90\% even for a concentration of 5000 mg/L. As was
   expected, increase of reaction temperature shortened the time taken to
   reach 50\% phenol conversion. In addition, TOC conversion also increased
   with reaction temperature. Working from these observed results, optimal
   operating conditions were proposed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Many in-lake measures which aimed to influence the phosphorus retention
   in lake sediments have failed to improve the-trophic state of the lakes.
   The present paper introduces a systematic approach to select an
   appropriate in-lake measure. Before selecting an in-lake measure the
   goal of the measure should be defined, the problems,of the lake must be
   identified, and the probability of success must be estimated. The
   proposed decision support consists of two parts. Part A, pre-selection,
   excludes inappropriate measures. It uses six criteria, which are mainly
   based on-a simple mass-balance model, and the targets of restoration.
   The criteria describe the magnitude of the external versus the internal
   phosphorus loading, the dynamics of the internal load, and. the lake
   morphometry. Each measure is weighted differently with respect to
   importance and suitability by specific quantified limits.. Part B,
   selection, uses qualitative criteria, which are, specific to the measure
   in question. Checking these criteria will help to select a measure with
   a low risk of failure. The suggested decision support is illustrated in
   flow charts and exemplified by Lake Arendsee in Germany. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{In this study, two economically important rivers of Turkey, Gediz and
   Buyuk Menderes (BM) are studied to determine their environmental
   pollution levels. An old analytical procedure involving sequential
   chemical extraction is improved and used for the partitioning of
   particulate trace metals (Cu, Co, Cr, Mn, Fe, Zn, Pb and Ni). Cationic
   and anionic Mn and Cr species with different phases are also determined
   by-using leaching, extraction and ion exchange speciation processes.
   The sediment samples are analysed using graphic-furnace atomic
   absorption spectroscopy and differential pulse anodic stripping
   voltammeter: Experimental results obtained on five replicate samples of
   fluvial bottom surface sediments at the sampling points demonstrate that
   the relative standard deviation of the sequential extraction procedure
   is generally better than +/-10\%. The accuracy, determined by comparing
   total metal concentrations with the sum of the five sequential chemical
   extractions, is proved to be satisfactory. The detection limits
   established for three standard deviations of blank for different metals
   are identical and found to be 0.1 mg/kg for sediment samples and 1 ppb
   for water samples. The results show that the pollution levels are
   significant especially for Pb, Cr, Mn and Zn in the Gediz river and Co,
   Mn, and Zn in the BM river. Comparison between our results and the
   measurements outlined before industralization and the beginning of the
   intensive pesticide applications in agricultural fields (In: Broekaert
   et al., editors, Metal speciation in the environment, vol. 23. 1989. p.
   601-11; A research on the environmental pollution in the agricultual
   fields and watering in the Aegean region, Ege University Research
   Project, No. 127 1988 (in Turkish); DSI Water Analyses Report, Ankara,
   1985 (in Turkish)) show that the pollution in these rivers is probably
   originated from industrial, agricultural and domestic waste discharges.

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring total organic carbon (TOC) is an important feature
   of stream water quality. This study investigates the dynamic load of TOC
   from the deep creek watershed into the lower St. Johns River (LSJR), FL,
   USA, using numerical simulations and field measurements. An existing St.
   Johns River watershed assessment model for simultaneous loading of
   nutrients from watersheds into rivers is modified to include the TOC
   component for the purpose of this study. Three simulation scenarios
   (i.e., daily, monthly, and annually) are performed to estimate the
   dynamic load of TOC in response to rainfall events. Simulations show
   that rainfall events have decisive effects on TOC loads from the Deep
   Creek watershed into the LSJR. In general, the highly frequent the
   rainfall events occur, the higher the TOC loads into the river.
   Simulations also illustrate that effects of rainfall events on daily
   changes of TOC are minimal in winter, but are profound in late summer.
   Results suggest that TOC load into the river is not only a
   rainfall-driven but also a temperature-driven biological process. (C)

Abstract = {{The inactivation kinetics of Bacillus subtilis spores with ozone and
   monochloramine was characterized by a lag phase followed by a
   pseudo-first-order rate of inactivation. The lag phase decreased and the
   post-lag phase rate constant increased with increasing temperature
   within the range investigated (1-30degreesC for ozone, 1-20degreesC for
   monochloramine). The corresponding activation energies were 46,820J/mol
   for ozone and 79,640J/mol for monochloramine. The CT concept was found
   to be valid within the concentration range investigated of 0.44-4.8 mg/l
   for ozone, and 3.8-7.7 mg/l as Cl-2 for monochloramine. The inactivation
   kinetics of B. subtilis spores with both ozone and monochloramine varied
   with pH within the range of pH 6-10 investigated. The fastest ozone and
   monochloramine inactivation rates were observed at pH 10 and 6,
   respectively. Different stocks of the same strain of B. subtilis spores
   had different resistance to ozone and monochloramine mainly because of
   discrepancies in the extent of the lag phase. B. subtilis spores might
   not be conservative surrogates for C parvum oocysts for ozone
   disinfection at relatively low temperature mainly due to the spores
   having a lower activation energy compared to that for the oocysts. In
   contrast, the activation energy for monochloramine was comparable for
   both microorganisms but differences in the extent of the lag phase might
   result in the spores being overly conservative surrogates for the
   oocysts at relatively low temperature (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cation-exchange separation, of Co2+/Ni2+ from aqueous solutions using
   water-soluble complexing agents of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
   (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid. (NTA), iminodiacetic acid (IDA), and
   citrate was experimentally Studied at 298 K. Experiments were carried
   out as a function. of initial aqueous pH (1.0-6.0), concentration of
   total metals (1.5-45.0 mol/m(3)), the concentration ratio of two metals
   (0.1-10) and of complexing agent to the total metals (0-1). It was shown
   that the exchange selectivity strongly depended on solution pH and was
   not completely related to the affinity of any metal with the complexing
   agents. When a certain level of complexing agent was present, highly
   effective separation could be achieved at an appropriate pH range (for
   an equimolar metal solution, e.g., pH 2-3 with EDTA and NTA as well as
   pH > 3 with IDA and citrate). The application potential of this method
   was highlighted for the separation of Co2+ from binary mixtures in the
   presence of trace amount of Ni2+ due to its high selectivity and-the
   smaller amount of the complexing agents needed. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The purpose of the paper is to examine the factors that influence the
   deterioration of denitrification in open anoxic reactors. For this
   investigation an ASM 1-based simulation model was developed and
   successfully applied to fit data from batch experiments carried out in
   lab-scale reactor vessels (uncovered and covered) using both clarified
   domestic wastewater and synthetic wastewater. Applying the verified
   model, simulation studies were performed to investigate the effects of
   available denitrifiable substrate, biomass concentration, oxygen
   transfer rate, and temperature on deterioration of denitrification in
   open anoxic reactors. It has been shown that oxygen entering an anoxic
   reactor through the surface may not just affect denitrification
   metabolically, but also kinetically, due to increased dissolved oxygen
   (DO) concentration exerting an inhibitory effect on the denitrification
   rate. When the exogenous substrate concentration in the reactor vessel
   is high enough for a high consumption rate, the DO concentration is kept
   low. The higher the biomass concentration, and thereby the consumption
   rate of endogenous substrate, the lower the DO concentration during the
   low-rate denitrification phase. At low substrate removal rates,
   decreasing temperature will cause the DO concentration in anoxic vessels
   to increase. The results suggest that assuring removal of available.
   exogenous carbon source at high rate by staging of open anoxic
   bioreactors may significantly improve denitrification efficiency. (C)

Abstract = {{The requirement for higher quality drinking water necessitates the
   application of more efficient water treatment techniques. Nanofiltration
   is one promising option for enhanced water treatment, for example, in
   enhanced organic matter removal. The characteristics of different
   nanofiltration membranes vary remarkably, and the selection of a
   membrane has to be made according to the requirements of an application.
   In this study six nanofiltration membranes (NF70, NF255, NTR-7450,
   NTR-7410, Desal-5 and TFC-S) were evaluated in improving the quality of
   chemically pretreated surface water in a pilot-scale process. The
   results indicate that the membrane with high organics removal and
   slightly reduced ion removal characteristics (NF255) performed best in
   terms of product water quality as well as membrane productivity and
   fouling. The most permeable membrane (NTR-7410) suffered intensive
   fouling and insufficient product water quality. An interesting finding
   was that the permeates of all the tested membranes possessed a
   significant potential for microbial growth, despite the low nutrient
   contents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were performed to evaluate temporal changes in the fractal
   dimension of aggregates formed during flocculation of an initially
   monodisperse suspension of latex microspheres. Particle size
   distributions and aggregate geometrical information at different mixing
   times were obtained using a non-intrusive optical sampling and digital
   image analysis technique, under variable conditions of mixing speed,
   coagulant (alum) dose and particle concentration. Pixel resolution
   required to determine aggregate size and geometric measures including
   the fractal dimension is discussed and a quantitative measure of
   accuracy is developed. The two-dimensional fractal dimension was found
   to range from 1.94 to 1.48, corresponding to aggregates that are either
   relatively compact or loosely structured, respectively. Changes in
   fractal dimension are explained using a conceptual model, which
   describes changes in fractal dimension associated with aggregate growth
   and changes in aggregate structure. For aggregation of an initially
   monodisperse suspension, the fractal dimension was found to decrease
   over time in the initial stages of floe formation. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Title = {{Chemistry of trace elements in coalbed methane product water}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{884-890}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Extraction of methane (natural gas) from coal deposits is facilitated by
   pumping of aquifer water. Coalbed methane (CBM) product water, produced
   from pumping ground water, is discharged into associated unlined holding
   ponds. The objective of this study was to examine the chemistry of trace
   elements in CBM product water at discharge points and in associated
   holding ponds across the Powder River Basin, Wyoming. Product water
   samples from discharge points and associated holding ponds were
   collected from the Cheyenne River (CHR), Belle Fourche River (BFR), and
   Little Powder River (LPR) watersheds during the summers of 1999 and
   2000. Samples were analyzed for pH, Al (aluminum), As (arsenic), B
   (boron), Ba (barium), Cr (chromium), Cu (copper), F (fluoride), Fe
   (iron), Mn (manganese), Mo (molybdenum), Se (selenium), and Zn (zinc).
   Chemistry of trace element concentrations were modeled with the MINTEQA2
   geochemical equilibrium model. Results of this study show that pH of
   product water for three watersheds increased in holding ponds. For
   example the pH of CBM product water increased from 7.21 to 8.26 for LPR
   watershed. Among three watersheds, the CBM product water exhibited
   relatively less change in trace element concentrations in CHR watershed
   holding ponds. Concentration of dissolved Al, Fe, As, Se, and F in
   product water increased in BFR watershed holding ponds. For example,
   concentration of dissolved Fe increased from 113 to 135 mug/L. Boron,
   Cu, and Zn concentrations of product water did not change in BFR
   watershed holding ponds. However, concentration of dissolved Ba, Mn, and
   Cr in product water decreased in BFR watershed holding ponds. For
   instance, Ba and Cr concentrations decreased from 445 to 386 mug/L and
   from 43.6 to 25.1 mug/L, respectively. In the LPR watershed, Al, Fe, As,
   Se, and F concentrations of product water increased substantially in
   holding ponds. For example, Fe concentration increased from 192 to 312
   mug/L. However, concentration of dissolved Ba, Mn, Cr, and Zn decreased
   in holding ponds. Geochemical modeling calculations suggested that
   observed increase of Al and Fe concentrations in holding ponds was due
   to increase in concentration of Al(OH)(4)(-) and Fe(OH)(4)(-) species in
   water which were responsible for pH increases. Decreases in Ba, Mn, Cr,
   and Zn concentrations were attributed to the increase in pH, resulting
   in precipitates of BaSO4 (barite), MnCO3 (rhodochrosite), Cr(OH)(2)
   (chromium hydroxide), and ZnCO3 (smithsonite) in pond waters,
   respectively. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{891-901}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Batch tests were Performed to investigate chemical and physical
   processes that may result during electrolytic aeration of a contaminated
   aquifer using naphthalene as a model contaminant. Naphthalene
   degradation of 58-66\% took place electrolytically and occurred at the
   same rates at a pH of 4 and 7. 1,4-naphthoquinone was identified as a
   product of the electrolysis. Stripping due to gases produced at the
   electrodes did not result in any naphthalene loss. Hydrogen peroxide
   (which may be produced at the cathode) did not have any effect on
   naphthalene, but the addition of ferrous iron (which may be present in
   aquifers) resulted in 67-99\% disappearance of naphthalene. Chlorine
   (which may be produced from the anodic oxidation of chloride) can
   effectively degrade naphthalene at PH of 4, but not at a PH of 7. Mono-,
   di- and poly chloronaphthalenes were identified as oxidation products.
   Ferric iron coagulation (due to the oxidation of ferrous iron) did not
   significantly contribute to naphthalene loss. Overall, electrolytic
   oxidation and chemical oxidation due to the electrolytic by-products
   formed are significant abiotic processes that could occur and should be
   accounted for if bioremediation of PAH-contaminated sites via
   electrolytic aeration is considered. Possible undesirable products such
   as chlorinated compounds may be formed when significant amounts of
   chlorides are present. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Using a cross-flow membrane bioreactor, high anaerobic conversion rates
   of three different types of wastewater with varying organic content were
   achieved. Loading rates obtained were as follows: 20g CODL-1 d(-1) for
   artificial wastewater, approximately 8g CODL-1 d(-1) from vegetable
   processing industry (sauerkraut brine) and 6-8 g COD L-1 d(-1) for
   wastewater from an animal slaughterhouse. At stable conditions,
   COD-removal rates in all three wastewaters were higher than 90\%.
   Methane yields from the treatment of artificial wastewater, sauerkraut
   brine, and animal slaughterhouse wastewater were in the range of
   0.17-0.30, 0.20-0.34, and 0.12-0.32L(n) g(-1) COD-1 fed, respectively.
   The complete retention of biomass and suspended solids is a unique
   feature of this treatment process, which combines a high loading
   capacity and at the same time, high COD removal rates even for complex
   wastewater containing high concentrations of particulate matter. (C)

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the application of a new PCR assay to detect and
   differentiate human and ruminant sources of fecal pollution in natural
   water samples. We tested samples collected from Tillamook Bay, Oregon,
   which has a long history of fecal pollution levels that exceed
   acceptable standards. The most likely sources are from dairy operations
   and ineffective sewage treatment. Using a suite of three PCR primer
   pairs specific for human or ruminant bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA
   markers, we detected at least one marker in 17 of 22 samples. In
   general, host-specific fecal markers were detected in areas that are
   heavily impacted by anthropogenic activities. Nine out of 11 sites
   classified as either urban or near a sewage point source were positive
   for the human marker while only five of these same sites were positive
   for ruminant markers. Conversely, 12 out of 21 sites classified as rural
   or agricultural use were positive for ruminant markers, while only six
   of these sites were positive for human pollution. This suite of
   host-specific genetic markers holds promise for identifying non-point
   source fecal pollution in coastal waters. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of trace metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn and Mo) on
   the denitrification unit at the Montreal Biodome. Two dosages of the
   five trace metals were tested on a denitrifying bacterial population
   which was extracted from the denitrification unit and cultured in 250 mL
   chemostats with artificial seawater. The low dosage showed a 20\%
   increase in the denitrification rate whereas the high dosage had a more
   pronounced effect with a 250\% increase. No increase in bacterial growth
   was observed, suggesting that the trace metals had an effect on the
   denitrification activity. When the trace metals were tested separately,
   only iron had a significant effect similar to the increase in the
   denitrification rate observed when the five trace metals were added. The
   combination of Fe and Mn caused a small but significant increase
   compared to the five trace metals. We then tested the effect of adding
   Fe, Mn and Cu to the denitrification unit at the Montreal Biodome. A
   high dosage of these trace metals showed a 250\% increase in the
   denitrification rate, which went from 200 to 700g NOx-N/d. Our results
   showed that the addition of trace metals is crucial for denitrification
   activities. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the efficacy of constructed wetlands for treatment
   of domestic wastewater for small communities located in rural areas,
   small-scale wetland mesocosms (400 L each) containing two treatment
   designs (a mixture of Typha, Scirpus, and Juncus species; control
   without vegetation) were planted into two depths (45 or 60 cm) with pea
   gravel. Each mesocosm. received 19 L/day of primary-treated domestic
   sewage. Mesocosms were monitored (inflow and outflow samples) on a
   monthly basis over a 2-year period for pH, total suspended solids (TSS),
   5-day biochemical oxygen demand (BODO5), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN),
   dissolved oxygen (DO), and conductivity. Microbiological analyses
   included enumeration of fecal coliforms, enterococci, Salmonella,
   Shigella, Yersinia, and coliphage. Significant differences between
   influent and effluent water quality for the vegetated wetlands (p<0.05)
   were observed in TSS, BOD5, and TKN. Increased DO and reduction in fecal
   coliform, enterococcus, Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, and coliphage
   populations also were observed in vegetated wetlands. Greatest microbial
   reductions were observed in the planted mesocosms compared to those
   lacking vegetation. Despite marked reduction of several contaminants,
   wetland-treated effluents did not consistently meet final discharge
   limits for receiving bodies of water. Removal efficiencies for bacteria
   and several chemical parameters were more apparent during the initial
   year compared to the second year of operation, suggesting concern for
   long-term efficiency and stability of such wetlands. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A survey of the herbicides present in surface and groundwaters was
   conducted in 1999 in an area of the provinces of Salamanca and Zamora
   (Central-Western Spain) to assess the degree of pollution of the
   agricultural land and seasonal changes in the presence of herbicide
   residues. Ten sites were sampled and screened for 17 herbicides commonly
   used in the area; the compounds were ureas, triazines, amides, and
   others. A previously optimised method involving. solid-phase extraction
   with polymeric cartridges, followed by HPLC with diode array detection,
   was used to monitor the herbicides. Of the 17 compounds examined, eight
   were found: chlorotoluron (41\% of total detections), terbutryn (21\%),
   atrazine (14\%), linuron (7\%), isoproturon and metolachlor (5.5\%
   each), lenacil (4\%) and metamitron (2\%). Of the detections, 66\%
   corresponded to river water samples (three sites). The herbicides found
   in groundwaters (seven sites) were: chlorotoluron, atrazine, terbutryn,
   linuron, and isoproturon, all of which are classified as probable or
   transient leachers in Europe. The temporal evolution of the herbicide
   content in river waters shows that the observed pollution is a function
   of time and is related to the application and use of the herbicides. By
   contrast, the pollution found in groundwaters was lower than that seen
   in surface waters, except that due to chlorotoluron, which,
   additionally, remained almost constant throughout the study period. (C)

Abstract = {{Disinfection by-products (DBP) are formed when natural organic matter
   (NOM) in water reacts with a disinfectant, usually chlorine. DBPs are a
   health risk element and regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. A
   study was conducted to evaluate the characteristics of NOM that
   contribute to DBPs in 17 different drinking water systems in Alaska. In
   order to determine the nature of the organic matter contributing to
   DBPs, DBP formation potential was compared with standard water quality
   parameters such as UV-254, color and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as
   well as pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results
   showed strong correlations between UV-254 and DBP formation potential
   for all waters studied. DOC, on the other hand, was less strongly
   correlated to DBP formation potential. Unlike previous studies, the
   total trihalomethane and haloacetic acid formation potentials were equal
   on a mass concentration basis for the waters studied. Pyrolysis-GC/MS
   indicated that NOM contributing to DBPs were primarily phenolic
   compounds. This finding was consistent with previous studies; however,
   unlike other studies, no correlation was found between aliphatic
   compounds in the raw Waters and DBP formation potential. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Trihalomethanes (THM) and haloacetic acids (HAA) are the most frequent
   chlorination by-products (CBP) in finished drinking waters.
   Traditionally, THM have been used as surrogates for CBP although the
   quantitative association between THM and other CBP is not well
   established. This problem is addressed in the present study from the
   analysis of THM and HAA in drinking water samples from four Spanish
   regions, representing areas with very different CBP composition, e.g.
   between 86 and 8.0 mug/l of THM and 50-3.0 mug/l of HAA.
   The resulting dataset exhibit a statistically significant correlation
   between total THM and. HAA (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r(p) =
   0.815, p<0.0005). Furthermore, specific HAA are highly correlated with
   specific THM or their combinations. Accordingly, multivariate linear
   regression analysis of the concentrations observed show that the levels
   in total and specific HAA can be predicted from the THM content; These
   results are relevant for epidemiological studies on health effects from
   CBP exposure since they usually involve comparison of populations
   consuming waters of very distinct quality. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The release of nutrients from the sediment into the water column, i.e.
   internal nutrient loading, is an important problem in the restoration of
   eutrophied lakes. The ebullition of gases, mainly methane, has been
   identified as the key process in nutrient transportation in the internal
   loading. We studied whether methane production in lake sediment and the
   release of nutrients into the water column could be prevented by the
   addition of gypsum (CaSO4 . 2H(2)O). Three different gypsum products
   were examined in a controlled laboratory microcosm with a continuous
   water flow. The addition of gypsum (especially Fe-gypsum) into the
   sediment increased the redox potentials and reduced methane production
   and release of phosphorus from the sediments during an incubation period
   of 3 months. Gypsum evidently acted as a slow-releasing source of
   sulphate in sediment, which likely enhanced the activity of
   sulphate-reducing bacteria and improved the overall mineralisation rate
   of organic matter. The liberation of H2S and phosphate, which might be
   an undesired consequence of increased sulphate reduction rates was
   prevented by the application of Fe-containing gypsum likely as a result
   of the formation of pyrite and apatite minerals. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper studied the effect of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) in
   the anoxic sludge zone on the excess sludge production in the
   oxic-settling-anoxic process (OSA process), a modified activated sludge
   process. Two pilot-scale activated sludge systems were employed in this
   study: (1) an OSA process that was modified from a conventional
   activated sludge process by inserting a sludge holding tank or namely
   the ``anoxic{''} tank in the sludge return line; and (2) a conventional
   process used as the reference system. Each was composed of a membrane
   bioreactor to serve the aeration tank and solid/liquid separator. Both
   systems were operated with synthetic wastewater for 9 months. During the
   operation, the OSA system was operated with different ORP levels (+ 100
   to -250 mV) in its anoxic tank. It has been confirmed that the OSA
   system produced much less excess sludge than the reference system. A
   lower ORP level than + 100 mV in the anoxic tank is in favor of the
   excess sludge reduction. When the ORP level decreased from + 100 to
   -250mV the sludge reduction efficiency was increased from 23\% to 58\%.
   It has also been found that the OSA system performed better than the
   reference system with respect to the chemical oxygen demand removal
   efficiency and sludge settleability. The OSA process may present a
   potential low-cost solution to the excess sludge problem in an activated
   sludge process because addition of a sludge holding tank is only needed.

Title = {{Effect of residual chlorine on the analysis of geosmin, 2-MIB and MTBE

Abstract = {{The effect of chlorine on the analysis of three organic compounds
   (geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE))
   in drinking water is elucidated. Three fibers for solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME) were employed for the extraction of the organic
   compounds from drinking water samples with and without free residual
   chlorine present. A gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer
   was used to analyze the compounds trapped by the fibers. The presence of
   chlorine substantially reduces the observed geosmin, 2-MIB, and MTBE
   concentrations. Depending on the analyte and chlorine concentrations, an
   experimental error of 10-70\% may be observed due to the presence of
   free residual chlorine. The impact is larger for lower organic compound
   concentrations, and under higher residual chlorine conditions. To
   counteract the effect from residual chlorine, sodium thiosulfate was
   used to dechlorinate the water. After dechlorination the experimental
   error was less than 10\%, suggesting that dechlorination is necessary
   when applying SPME for the extraction of organic compounds from
   chlorinated drinking water. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights
