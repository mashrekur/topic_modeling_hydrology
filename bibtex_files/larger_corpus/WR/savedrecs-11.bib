Abstract = {{Since Zoogloea ramigera has been considered to be important in aerobic
   wastewater treatment, we have evaluated several methods for detecting
   and enumerating Z. ramigera in water and wastewater samples. Indirect
   immunoassay methods for the detection of Zoogloea strains were developed
   using polyclonal antibodies against the cells or the isolated
   exocellular polymer (EP) of the neotype Zoogloea ramigera strain 106
   (ATCC 19544). The primary antibodies reacted with the cells and the
   exopolymer associated with finger-like zoogloeal projections, but not
   with other bacteria from natural samples. These antibodies allowed
   detection of Z. ramigera in environmental samples. Scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) was used to show that the cells and the exocellular
   polymer of naturally occurring zoogloeal projections are antigenically
   and structurally related to those of Z. ramigera 106. Both immunological
   procedures and probes complementary to regions on the 16S rRNA could
   detect Z. ramigera in natural samples but the immunological procedures
   were easier to use. RT-PCR was also used to detect Z. ramigera in
   natural samples. These methods were also used to identify Z. ramigera in
   biofilms that developed over wastewater samples as part of an MPN
   procedure that was used to quantitate Z. ramigera at different stages of
   the wastewater treatment process and in different lakes. Z. ramigera
   could be found in all stages of wastewater treatment processes, from raw
   wastewater to chlorinated effluent. The highest concentration of Z.
   ramigera was found in the mixed liquor stage of the a wastewater
   treatment plant. Additionally, Z. ramigera was found in all eutrophic
   and mesotrophic lakes and in some oligotrophic lakes. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in water from eutrophic Lake Kasumigaura,
   its inflowing rivers, and several other DOM sources in the lake
   catchment area was fractionated using resin adsorbents into five
   classes: aquatic humic substances (AHS), hydrophobic neutrals (HoN),
   hydrophilic acids (HiA), bases (BaS), and hydrophilic neutrals (HiN).
   The DOM-fraction distribution pattern and the ultraviolet absorbance to
   dissolved organic carbon ratio (UV/DOC ratio) were found remarkably
   effective for evaluating the characteristics of DOM in water.
   DOM-fraction distribution patterns were significantly different
   depending on the origin of the sample. AHS and HiA were found to be the
   dominant fractions in DOM in all samples studied. HiA prevailed over AHS
   in the lake water, whereas AHS were slightly more abundant than HiA in
   the river waters. AHS were in the great majority in forest streams and
   plowed-field percolates. HiA abounded in paddy-field outflow, domestic
   sewage, and sewage-treatment-plant effluent. Only domestic sewage
   contained a significant amount of HoN. The UV/DOC ratio also varied
   depending on the origin of the sampled the ratios in total DOM, AHS, and
   HiA were greater in river waters than in the lake water. The greatest
   ratio of AHS was found in paddy-field outflow and the lowest in domestic
   sewage. The UV/DOC ratios in the sewage-treatment-plant effluent were
   very similar to those in the lake water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper explores ways in which the analysis of microbial data from
   routine compliance monitoring, in combination with basic environmental
   data, can provide insight into the factors affecting faecal-indicator
   organism concentrations in coastal waters. In the case study presented,
   eight designated bathing waters on the Fylde coast are continuing to
   exhibit unreliable compliance with the Imperative standards for total
   coliform (TC) and faecal coliform (FC) concentrations specified in the
   EU Bathing Water Directive (76/160/EEC), despite significant reductions
   in geometric mean concentrations following recent major investment in
   the sewerage infrastructure. Faecal streptococci (FS) concentrations
   have remained high and have not been improved by the new sewerage
   schemes. The results suggest that, prior to the schemes, higher
   bacterial concentrations were strongly associated with rainfall: and
   sewage sources were important for TC and FC, but less important for FS,
   which may have been more strongly affected by diffuse catchment sources.
   In the post-schemes period, catchment sources appear to be of greater
   significance rainfall remains as a significant, though less important,
   predictors and tide height at time of sampling, together with variables
   such as sunshine and the proportion of onshore winds (which affect the
   survival and movement of bacteria that have already entered the coastal
   waters), assume greater significance. The approach used here provides a
   cost-effective management tool for the exploratory investigation of any
   monitoring point that is failing to meet recreational water quality
   standards. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Weekly wet deposition and throughfall rain samples were collected in.
   the Blacklick Run (BLK) and Herrington Creek Tributary (HCRT), two
   streams in western Maryland (MD). Samples were analyzed for total
   mercury (Hg), methylmercury (MMHg), arsenic (As), selenium (Se), cadmium
   (Cd), and lead (Pb). Hg concentrations generally fell between 50 and
   100pM. comparable to concentrations in wet deposition measured at other
   MID sites. While Hg concentrations decreased with rainfall amount, a
   similar washout trend was not seen for MMHg. Cd, Pb, As. and Se
   concentrations were comparable overall to those measured in the region.
   Concentrations of Hg, Cd, and Pb in throughfall were similar between
   sites and equivalent or higher than wet deposition concentrations. As
   and Se concentrations were similar in throughfall at the two sites,
   though throughfall at BLK seemed to be punctuated with slightly higher
   concentrations of these two metals. Concentrations of Hg, MMHg, Cd, Pb,
   As, Se, and SPM were measured in monthly stream collections and compared
   with concentrations found in other MD rivers. In addition to the monthly
   collections, four storm events were sampled. These measurements
   demonstrate the importance of storm events in trace metal transport.
   especially for Hg. Pb and MMHg. For these metals, a strong correlation
   between metal and suspended particulate concentration was evident.
   Retention efficiencies of the watersheds for the metals were calculated
   for each watershed. Of all the metals, Hg is the most and As is the
   least strongly retained in the watershed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Kohonen neural network (KNN) was applied to nutrient data (ammonia,
   nitrite, nitrate and phosphate) taken from coastal waters in a Spanish
   tourist area. The activation maps obtained were not sufficient to
   evaluate and predict the trophic status of coastal waters. To achieve
   this aim, a new methodology is proposed which uses as its starting point
   the activation maps obtained from KNN. Firstly, to evaluate the trophic
   status of the coastal waters. it consists of the development of a
   quadrat system which enables a better classification than the
   traditional classification based simply on standardized data. The new
   classification allows clear differentiation of water quality within the
   mesotrophic band. Secondly, and in order to use the activation maps as
   predictive tools, the trophic classification. obtained from activation
   maps, was transposed onto new activation maps. To do this, the
   activation maps of the sampling points which defined each trophic group
   were superimposed. To avoid unnecessary complexity and to facilitate the
   process, this superimposition was undertaken only where the frequency
   exceeded 0.05. In this way, four frequency maps related to the trophic
   status of coastal waters (potentially eutrophic, high mesotrophic, low
   mesotrophic and oligotrophic) were obtained. There was no loss of
   relevant information in the new maps thus obtained. These frequency maps
   served as the basis for the successful prediction of the trophic status
   of random samples of coastal waters. This methodology, based on KNN, is
   proposed as a tool to aid the decision-making in coastal water quality
   management. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biofilms on pipe walls in water distribution systems are composed of
   bacteria in a polymeric matrix, which can lead to chlorine demand,
   coliform growth, pipe corrosion and water taste and odour problems. The
   majority of previous studies have been laboratory or pilot plant based
   and few results are available for field conditions. In this study, field
   observations of biofilm were made using biofilm potential monitors. The
   monitor results were compared with pipe samples taken from the
   distribution system and with laboratory pipe reactors. An empirical
   equation quantified the inhibitory effects of free chlorine and decrease
   of temperature on biofilm growth. With water having total organic carbon
   concentrations in the range 1.5-3.9 mg/l, a free chlorine residual of
   0.2 mg/l was needed to reduce biofilm concentration to below 50 pg
   ATP/cm(2). Pipe material influenced biofilm activity far less than
   chlorine with mean biofilm activity being ranked in the order glass (136
   pg ATP/cm(2)) < cement (212 pg ATP/cm(2)) < MDPE (302 pg ATP/cm(2)) <
   PVC (509 pg ATP/cm(2)). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The oyster Crassostrea rhizophorae was collected in September 1997 from
   10 stations along the Potengi estuary, Natal, Brazil, a mangrove-lined
   estuary receiving anthropogenic inputs of trace metals. C. rhizophorae
   is a net accumulator of trace metals and can be used as it biomonitor,
   the accumulated soft tissue concentrations representing integrated
   records of bioavailable metal fractions over the life of the oyster.
   Significant differences in oyster accumulated concentrations (and hence
   bioavailabilities) of Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Cd, Ni and Ag (but not Mn)
   were found between stations, Ind attributed to anthropogenic inputs
   including discharges of sewage and industrial effluent. The oysters are
   also a local food source, and concentrations of zinc, copper and lead in
   some of the oysters are above typical public health recommended limits.

   biomass strongly depends on equilibrium pH. Equilibrium isotherms were
   also obtained and maximum removal of Cr(VI) was around 14.7 x 10(3) mg
   metal/kg of dry weight biomass at a pH of 2.0 in 120 min with 5 mg/l of
   initial concentration. The results indicated that the biomass of
   Spirogyra species is suitable for the development of efficient
   biosorbent for the removal and recovery of Cr(VI) from wastewater. (C)

Abstract = {{Acid volatile sulfides (AVS) in sediments are available for binding with
   divalent cationic metals through the formation of insoluble
   metal-sulfide complexes, thereby controlling the metal bioavailability
   and subsequent toxicity to benthic biocommunities. However, when the
   molar concentrations of simultaneously extracted metals (SEM) were
   greater than AVS, the unexpectedly low or nondetectable levels of metal
   in pore water could also be found. Thus, except AVS. additional binding,
   phases in sediments were supposed to provide the binding sites for SEM.
   The aims of this study are to realize the spatial distribution of AVS,
   SEM, and other binding phases of heavy metals in anoxic sediments of the
   Ell-Ren river and to elucidate what may be the main additional binding
   phases except AVS in the anoxic river sediments. By comparing the
   spatial distributions or SEM,. AVS ratio with various binding phases in
   extremely anoxic sediments (redox potential was between -115 and -208
   mV), both organic matter and carbonates could be considered to be the
   main additional binding phases of SEM other than AVS. In addition. AVS
   appeared to have the priority to bind with SEM. By comparing the binding
   phases of heavy metals before and after AVS extraction, it could be
   found that Fe-oxides could also be considered to be the main additional
   binding phase associated with Zn in slightly anoxic sediments (redox
   potential was between -50 and -130 mV), while organic matter with Cu
   being the next. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The gas injection technique was introduced to achieve flux improvement
   in cross-flow ultrafiltration of oil emulsion. By the nitrogen gas
   injection, homogeneous liquid phase oil/water emulsion was changed to
   heterogeneous gas-liquid phase. The injected gas causes positive effect
   of promoting turbulence, but it also has negative effect of decreasing
   the effective membrane area due to the partial occupation of membrane
   pores by bubbles. The efficiency of the gas injection was found out to
   be dependent on bubble fractions in the mixture: at sufficient bubble
   fractions the higher flux was observed, but at lower bubble fractions
   the flux rather decreased compared with that without gas injection. An
   attempt was made to explain the mechanisms for the dual aspects of gas
   injection. Turbulence dampening effect was also observed when the
   dependence of mass transfer coefficient on cross-flow rate was
   investigated with gas injection. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The feasibility of the direct denitrification treatment of copper metal
   pickling wastewater by using a bio-electrochemical reactor process was
   investigated experimentally. Carbon electrodes were installed in the
   reactor as the anode and cathode and denitrifying microorganisms were
   fixed oil the surface of the cathode. The reactor was continuously
   operated by applying an electric current and feeding acetate. In this
   reactor, copper ion removal and denitrification proceeded Simultaneously
   and the pH value of the treated water was increased almost to neutral.
   The electric current that passed through the cathode contributed to the
   removal of the copper ion and the generation of hydrogen gas, The
   generated hydrogen gas as well as the added acetate was effectively
   utilized for denitrification. A theoretical evaluation of pH the the
   effluent suggested that the pH increase was mainly caused by the
   generation of hydroxyl ion during denitrification. In addition, the
   inorganic carbon species generated during denitrification with acetate
   and by the electrochemical oxidation of anodic carbon acted as a buffer
   to minimize a further increase of pH at higher nitrate removal
   efficiencies. These results demonstrated that copper ion removal,
   denitrification and neutralization could be achieved simultaneously by
   using a single bioelectrochemical reactor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The acid-base properties of natural illites from different areas were
   studied by potentiometric titrations. The acidimetric supernatant was
   regarded as the system blank to calculate the surface site concentration
   due to consideration of substrate dissolution during the prolonged
   acidic titration. The following surface complexation model could give a
   good interpretation of the surface acid base reactions of the aqueous
   illites:
   > SOH <----> > SO- +H+, pk(a)(int) = 3.73 similar to 4.06,
   Al3+ + H4SiO4 + 2H(2)O <----> Al(OH)(2)(OSi(OH)(3)) + 3H(+), pK(t2) =
   9.85 similar to 10.71,
   > SOH + Al3+ + H4SiO4 <----> > SOAl(OSi(OH)(3))(+) + 2H(+), pK(SC) =
   3.31 similar to 3.40.
   Both experimental and optimized data revealed some similarities in the
   acid-base behaviors of the different illites. Based on matching results
   with the standard XRD patterns, the changes in intensities of the
   diagnostic 00l diffraction lines indicated that the formation of surface
   Al-Si complexes or precipitates appeared preferable to the bulk
   deposition of Al(OH)3 solid. Similar features were also reflected in the
   microscopic Raman spectra, where the vibrational peaks of Si-O and Al-O
   bonds diminished following acid attack, then rose again after hydroxide
   back titration. The varied ratio of signal intensity between Al-IV and
   Al-VI species present in Al-27 MAS NMR spectra, together with the nearly
   stable BET surface areas after acidic titration, showed that the basal
   planes in the layer structure of natural illite contributed to the
   dissociation of structural components as well as the edge faces. The
   combined spectroscopic evidence plus the acid-base titration results
   suggested that the interactions of illite surface sites with silicic
   acid and aluminum species. released from illite substrate, should be
   considered in the modeling description. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Pilot-scale constructed wetlands were used to treat water contaminated
   by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), particularly fluoranthene,
   and the possible role Of fungi Present ill these ecosystems was
   investigated. A total of 40 fungal species (24 genera) were isolated and
   identified from samples (gravel and sediments) from it contaminated
   wetland and a control wetland. All of them were assayed for their
   ability to remove anthracene (AC) and fluoranthene (FA) front liquid
   medium. FA was degraded efficiently by 33 species while only 2 species
   were able to remove AC over 70\%. A selection of 10 strains of
   micromycetes belonging to various taxonomic groups was further
   investigated for FA and AC degradation, toxicity assays and
   phenoloxidases (POx) detection. Interesting and not previously reported
   species were revealed (Absidia cylindrospora, Cladosporium
   sphaerospermum and Ulocladium chartarum). They were all able to highly
   degrade the PAH-model compounds chosen. Ali interesting inducibility
   wits noted for Ulocladium chartarum. Degradative ability of fungi was
   not related to their extracellular POx activity. This study may
   contribute to the improvement of constructed wetlands for water
   treatment, which may be enriched in efficient fungi. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although research suggests that anaerobic treatment of low-strength
   domestic wastewater is possible in temperate climates, to date,
   full-scale applications have only been pioneered in hot regions.
   However, burgeoning environmental legislation in developed countries is
   giving the impetus to develop anaerobic wastewater treatment systems due
   to potential economic and environmental benefits they hold over
   traditional aerobic techniques. In this paper a design rationale for
   low-temperature, low-strength (COD < 1000 mg l(-1)), two-phase anaerobic
   wastewater treatment is developed through empirical modelling of data
   from published research, and from assumptions arising from a literature
   review. Model calculations are applied to typical domestic sewage
   characteristics at two different flow rates, based on population
   equivalents. Results indicate that soluble COD production in the model
   hydrolytic tank are similar to those achieved in pilot scale plants in
   the Netherlands. Model anaerobic reactor sludge characteristics are
   similar to those achieved in pilot and full-scale anaerobic reactors
   treating low-strength wastewaters. Indicative cost figures for a
   two-phase anaerobic treatment plant are given, but are incomplete
   without an assessment of the cost of post-treatment processes. Anaerobic
   treatment is likely to become more attractive in the future as new
   legislation relating to sludge disposal and renewable energy generation
   are introduced. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of fibreboard manufacturing (FBM) wastewaters was carried
   out in an industrial pilot plant, which consisted of a hybrid upflow
   sludge bed filter (USBF) anaerobic reactor and a
   coagulation-flocculation unit as a pre-treatment. COD removal
   efficiencies of 90-93\% were attained in the anaerobic reactor operating
   at 37 degreesC at organic loading rates (OLR) of 6.5 8.5 kg COD/m(3) d.
   Flocculant sludges were used as inoculum, and granulation was observed
   in the USBF reactor after 120 days of operation. The overall linear
   upward velocity (result of liquid and gas flow) was the key factor
   controlling biomass retention and, therefore, a stable operation at high
   OLR. According to ecotoxicity values (measured by means of
   bioluminescence assays), the wastewaters were partially detoxified,
   being EC50 values for the liquid effluent 25 times lower than those
   corresponding to the in fluent. Besides, phenolic compounds removal
   efficiencies of 90\% were attained. The hybrid reactor configuration is
   an interesting alternative to treat these wastewaters since it is less
   sensitive to biomass clogging or floatation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The adsorption isotherms of yellow and red dye solutions onto granular
   activated carbon at varying solution pHs (2-8), temperatures (15-50
   degreesC), and alcohol concentrations (0 20\%) were experimentally
   determined by batch tests and the Toth model was found to best fit the
   adsorption isotherm data for varying solution pHs, temperatures, and
   alcohol concentrations. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to
   decrease with increasing solution pH and alcohol concentration and could
   be predicted by the correlation equations obtained in this study. A
   correlation equation was also obtained to account for the effects of
   solution temperature on the adsorption equilibrium constant. The 25
   degreesC water was found to be a very poor regenerant for the carbon bed
   presaturated with the yellow dye compared with 20\% alcohol solution. A
   simple equation was derived, based on non-linear wave propagation
   theory, to predict the desorption curves of activated carbon bed. Given
   presaturation concentration, bed density and void fraction, and
   adsorption isotherm, the wave propagation theory predicted the
   desorption curves quite satisfactorily. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Lipid biomarkers are now widely used to trace organic matter in the
   marine environment. Selected compounds and ratios can be used to
   identify sources or processes. However. in a study of a particularly
   contaminated area, the expected signatures were not found (Mudge and
   Seguel. Bol. Soc. Chil. Quim. 42 (1997) 5). This site has been
   re-examined to determine why they were absent. The concentrations of
   sterols, fatty acids and alcohol biomarkers of 10 sediment cores from
   Concepcion Bay, Chile, were quantified by capillary gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. The data obtained from 34 fatty acids,
   28 fatty alcohols (C-12-C-30) and 32 sterols from the target study area,
   indicated that fatty acids from Concepcion Bay sediments were the most
   abundant lipids (range 1.6-307 mug g(-1) 1 dry wt) followed by sterols
   (range 0.02-25.3 mug g(-1) dry wt). The sewage markers 5 beta
   -coprostanol and epi-coprostanol were found in the areas close to the
   Penco-Lirquen disposal pipe. High bacterial activity was also present as
   indicated by the cholestanol, 18 : 1 omega7. iso, anteiso and branched
   fatty acids and enhanced odd/even ratios of fatty alcohol biomarkers.
   The sediments from the centre of Concepcion Bay had a greater
   marine/algal input characterized by brassicasterol and the marine fatty
   acids (20 : 4 omega6, 20 : 5 omega3 22 : 6 omega3). The terrestrial
   contribution was mainly characterized by beta -sitosterol. C-22-C-26
   fatty acids and confirmed by short/long chain ratio of the fatty
   alcohols. The distribution of these two markers indicates that the
   terrestrial matter passing through the sewage system is deficient in
   short chain fatty alcohols. The epi-coprostanol/coprosta not versus
   coprostanol cholesterol plots also indicated selected removal of the
   stanols leaving apparently high cholesterol concentrations. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The three-way catalytic converters introduced to oxidize and reduce
   gaseous automobile emissions represent a source of platinum group
   elements (PGEs), in particular platinum, palladium and rhodium, to the
   urban environment. Abrasion of automobile exhausts leads to an increase
   of the concentration of PGEs in environmental matrices such as
   vegetation. soil and water bodies. The bioaccumulation of Pd, Pt and Rh
   by the freshwater isopod Asellus aquaticus was studied in natural
   ecosystems and under laboratory conditions. Owing to the low
   concentration level (ng g(-1)) of PGEs in the animals studied, analyses
   were performed with a quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass
   spectrometry (ICP-MS) and hafnium, copper, yttrium, rubidium, strontium
   and lead were monitored for spectral interference correction. Asellus
   aquaticus collected in an urban river showed a content (mean +/- s) of
   155.4 +/- 73.4, 38.0 +/- 34.6, and 17.9 +/- 12.2 ng g(-1) (dry weight)
   for Pd, Pt and Rh, respectively. The exposure of Asellus aquaticus to
   PGE standard solutions for a period of 24 h give bioaccumulation factors
   of Bf: 150, 85, and 7 for Pd, Pt and Rh, respectively. Exposure of
   Asellus aquaticus to environmental samples for different exposure
   periods demonstrated that PGE bioaccumulation is time dependent, and
   shows a higher accumulation for the materials with a higher PGE content.
   While all three elements have the same uptake rate for exposure to
   catalyst materials, for exposure to environmental materials they have a
   different uptake rate which can be attributed to transformations of the
   PGE species in the environment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Kinetic transfer coefficients are important parameters to understand Ind
   reliably model the behaviour of non-conservative radionuclides in
   aquatic environments. This report pertains to I series of five
   radiotracer experiments on Pu uptake in natural aqueous suspensions of
   unfiltered waters from three aquatic systems in the south of Spain
   (Gergal reservoir. the Guadalquivir river, Ind the estuary of the Tinto
   river). The experimental procedure ensured the simulation of
   environmental conditions. Pit activity was measured by a liquid
   scintillation technique. The uptake curves, covering I period up to one
   week, are discussed with respect to numerical uptake kinetics models.
   The data suggest that in our experimental setting the main pathways for
   Pu uptake consist of two parallel and reversible reactions followed by a
   consecutive non-reversible reaction. Kinetic transfer coefficients were
   estimated by a fitting procedure and a comparative study was followed.

Abstract = {{Struvite precipitation in wastewater treatment works has caused
   substantial operational problems since the early 1960s. Struvite,
   magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate (MgNH4PO4. 6H(2)O). is a white
   inorganic crystalline mineral that precipitates in places with increased
   turbulence such as pumps, aerators and pipe bends. Batch experiments
   were conducted to examine the influence of a number of physical and
   chemical parameters on struvite crystallisation. This was undertaken by
   dosing a medium of de-ionised water with varying concentrations of Mg2+,
   NH4+ and PO43- ions. Preliminary experiments found that struvite could
   be precipitated out of solution at PH 10 and increasing the ion
   concentration stoichiometrically could increase crystal yield.
   Increasing the NH4+ concentration increased purity of the precipitate.
   As reaction time was increased from I to 180 min, crystal size was found
   to increase from 0.1 to 3 mm. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The application of bitumen in, e.g. asphalt roads, roofs, and hydraulic
   applications will lead to the leaching of compounds from the
   bitumen/asphalt into the environment. Because polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in bitumen, static and dynamic leach
   tests have been performed to study the leaching behaviour of this class
   of compounds. Nine petroleum bitumens covering a representative range of
   commercially available products and one asphalt made from one of the
   bitumens have been tested in a static leach test. The asphalt has been
   also subjected to a dynamic leach test.
   The main conclusions are that a 30 h dynamic leach test is sufficient to
   determine the equilibrium concentration that will be reached after
   bitumen or asphalt has been in contact with the water for more than 3-6
   days. As an alternative to performing a leach test. this concentration
   can be calculated from the PAH concentrations in the bitumen, and their
   distribution coefficients, as calculated here, or from their aqueous
   solubilities. The equilibrium PAH concentrations in the leach water from
   bitumens stay well below the surface water limits that exist in several
   EEC-countries and are also more than an order of magnitude lower than
   the current EEC limits for potable water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The location and activity of esterase enzymes in activated Sludge from
   three Municipal wastewater treatment plants were characterized using
   model Substrate, and denaturing and nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis (PAGE) Of particulate, freeze thaw (primarily
   periplasmic enzymes and those associated with outer cell surfaces) and
   extracellular fractions of activated sludge bacteria. Particulate and
   freeze thaw fractions had a similar spectrum of substrate specificity
   and contained significant levels of protein and esterase activity
   against model substrates, C-2 C-18 monoesters or p-nitrophenol and C-2
   C-8 diesters of fluorescein. Esterase activity was highest with
   substrates that had short alkyl chains (C-4) and decreased as the chain
   lengths increased beyond C-8. Extracellular fractions contained very low
   levels of protein (<0.1 mg/l) and showed no esterase activity against
   any of the model substrates tested. Multiple hands were observed upon
   analysis of particulate and freeze-thaw fractions by non-denaturing PAGE
   in combination with activity staining using various alpha -naphthol
   ester substrates (C-2 C-8). Our results indicate that esterase cnzyrnes
   in activated sludge are fairly diverse from a structural standpoint but
   exhibit a high level of functional redundancy, with different enzymes
   catalyzing the same reactions in different sludges. Extracellular
   esterase activity was totally absent tor the substrates we tested and
   the esterase activity that we observed was closely linked to a
   particulate floc or cellular Material. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of electrolytically released copper and silver
   ions on the microbiological quality in a warm water system of a
   hospital. The concentration of nontuberculous mycobacteria was followed
   for three, and that of legionellae and other heterotrophic bacteria in
   the water for four years. The highest concentrations of copper and
   silver ions were 220 and 68 mug/l, respectively. Silver ion
   concentration of about 3 mug/l was sufficient to control the growth of
   legionellae in circulating warm water. The results showed that it is
   more difficult to eradicate legionellae from taps and showers: these
   points were colonized by a small number of legionellae after the metal
   ion concentrations were increased in the circulating water. A regular
   use of water eradicated legionellae from the shower. One tap was still
   used irregularly, and this may be a reason why it still contained small
   concentrations of legionellae also in the last years of the study.
   Mycobacteria were occasionally isolated from the circulating water and
   repeatedly from the shower, even when the metal concentrations were
   high. To control legionella bacteria in warm water systems, silver
   concentrations of only 3 mug/l are needed if all taps and showers of the
   system are regularly used. Such low copper and silver concentrations,
   however, are not efficient against nontuberculous mycobacteria or other
   heterotrophic bacteria. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The removal of color and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from simulated dye
   wastewater containing Acid Orange II was experimentally investigated
   using coagulation-electrooxidation. Two kinds of coagulation methods,
   ferrous-mediated coagulation and electrocoagulation were tested as
   pretreatment. The electrooxidation was carried out in a cell with a
   three-phase three-dimensional electrode using granular activated carbon
   as particle electrodes. Particular attention was paid to probe the
   effect of cell voltage, airflow rate, solution conductivity and
   treatment time on the electrochemical treatment efficiency. The
   experimental results showed that the coagulation-electrooxidation
   process could efficiently remove the color and the COD from the
   simulated dye wastewater. The overall COD and color removal efficiencies
   reached as high as 99\% and 87\%, respectively, by ferrous coagulation
   (molar rate of Fe(II)/dye: 0.5) and 30-min electrolysis (cell voltage:
   20.0V and airflow: 0.1 m(3)h(-1)). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Regeneration of ion exchange resins with NaCl produces brine containing
   high concentrations of nitrate that can be difficult to remove using
   standard biological, physical, or chemical technologies. In this study,
   Halomonas campisalis (ATCC \#700597) (Mormile et cit., 1949) was shown
   to completely reduce nitrate at 125g/L NaCl and pH 9. This organism was
   also used in experiments to determine nitrate-reduction rates and
   biomass yields. Kinetic parameters were measured separately with
   glycerol, lactate, acetate, ethanol, and methanol. The specific
   nitrate-reduction rate coefficient was highest in cultures amended with
   acetate, while lactate and glycerol (a natural osmoticum in hypersaline
   environments) had lower reduction rates. No evidence of nitrate
   reduction was observed when ethanol or methanol was provided as an
   electron donor. Kinetic modeling provided values for nitrate and
   nitrite-reduction rate coefficients and for biomass yields. Measured
   rates and yields were similar to reported parameters obtained from
   non-halophilic nitrate-reducing cultures under low salt concentrations.
   Therefore, for highly saline solutions, the use of halophiles to
   selectively remove nitrate from these brines may represent a viable
   treatment option. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of 56 river water samples by the Enterolert (R) defined
   substrate technique, and standard m-Enterococcus agar isolation followed
   by confirmation, indicated that after 24 h incubation, Enterolert (R)
   significantly underestimated the true numbers of enterococci. Extending
   Enterolert (R) incubation to 36 h improved detection but also revealed
   false positives. These findings prompted the development of a novel
   confirmation medium we have termed glucosidase agar, which was prepared
   by dissolving Enterolert (R) substrate in 2\% (w/v) bacteriological
   agar. Analysis of 1043 colonies arising on m-Enterococcus agar from 280
   freshwater, marine and sewage effluent samples. demonstrated that a 2-4
   It incubation oil glucosidase agar was a rapid and accurate means of
   confirming presumptive enterococci, when compared to standard
   confirmation procedures that take 48 h. The combination of primary
   isolation on ni-Enterococcus agar followed by confirmation on
   glucosidase agar permits maximum recovery of Enterococcus whilst
   effectively eliminating false positives/negatives and provides a
   reliable alternative use of the Enterolert defined substrate technology.

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have been carried out on s-triazines, and more
   specifically on atrazine, with the long-term objective of resolving the
   problems caused by these herbicides removing them from drinking water.
   However, applications have remained too limited. So far, processes based
   on photochemical degradation have been little implemented.
   We, therefore, investigated the development of photochemical processes,
   emphasizing their capacity to degrade triazine by photolytic and
   photocatalytic mode. The study sought to assess the performance of these
   systems, Experiments showed that according to a medium pressure mercury
   source (UV-Vis irradiation), the photolytic degradation of atrazine was
   very efficient, with a best atrazine degradation half-life shorter than
   5 min, The main degradation pathway was deshalogenation. The
   photocatalytic degradation of atrazine under irradiation over 290 nm in
   the presence of titanium dioxide was shown to be efficient too, with a
   half-life of about 20min. In this case an experimental design was
   conducted so as to assess the influence of various parameters: pH, water
   medium, and amount of catalyst. There has been observational evidence
   for the efficiency of the processes investigated here and for potential
   technological developments as regards drinking water treatment. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{This study analysed water quality data collected from the river Ganges
   in India from 1981 to 1990 for forecasting using stochastic models.
   Initially the box and whisker plots and Kendall's tau test were used to
   identify the trends during the study period. For detecting the possible
   intervention in the data the time series plots and cusum charts were
   used, The three approaches of stochastic modelling which account for the
   effect of seasonality in different ways, i.e. multiplicative
   autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, deseasonalised
   model and Thomas-Fiering model were used to model the observed pattern
   in water quality. The multiplicative ARIMA model having both nonseasonal
   and seasonal components were, in general, identified as appropriate
   models. In the deseasonaliscd modelling approach, the lower order ARIMA
   models were found appropriate for the stochastic component. The set of
   Thomas-Fiering models were formed for each month for all water quality
   parameters. These models were then used to forecast the future values.
   The error estimates of forecasts from the three approaches were compared
   to identify the most suitable approach for the reliable forecast. The
   deseasonalised modelling approach was recommended for forecasting of
   water quality parameters of a river. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The effect of pre-acidification on anaerobic granule bed processes
   treating brewery wastewater was the focus of a comparison study
   employing two configurations, (a) a single stage upflow anaerobic sludge
   bed (UASB) and (b) an upflow acidification reactor in series with a
   methanogenic UASB. The pre-acidification reactor achieved 20 +/- 4\%
   SCOD removal and 0.08 +/- 0.003 L of methane produced per gram of SCOD
   removal at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 0.75-4 h. Butyric acid
   was not detected and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were mainly acetic
   and propionic acids. The acidification ratio was about 0.42 +/- 0.02g
   SCFAs as COD/g of influent COD.
   Both systems' critical loading rate to achieve 80\% COD removal was
   established at 34-39 kg COD/m(3) of total sludge bed volume per day.
   SCOD removal efficiency of 90 +/-3\% was achieved by both systems at an
   organic loading rate of 25 +/-1 kg COD/m(3) of total sludge bed volume
   per day, indicating that the installation of an acidification reactor
   had no effect in terms of the maximum granular activity, biomass
   granulation and the settleability of granules. At an organic loading
   rate of 67 kg COD/m(3) of total sludge bed volume per day at an HRT of I
   h, the series system outperformed the single UASB by a removal of 62

Abstract = {{To evaluate and design staged activated sludge systems it is necessary
   to determine the biomass requirement for a given configuration. This
   depends on both kinetics and treatment requirements. We present a
   procedure to determine the optimum reactor configuration for a range of
   influent and effluent substrate concentrations, half saturation
   coefficients, and number of tanks in series for both inhibitory and
   non-inhibitory substrates. Dimensionless plots of the results show the
   minimum biomass requirement of the series relative to that for a single
   CSTR and the optimal relative sizes of the tanks. The plots may be used
   directly for staged system design and lead to the following conclusions:
   three tanks in series is generally best, high influent substrate
   concentrations and stringent discharge requirements increase the benefit
   of staging, and optimal tank sizing is significantly better than using
   equal sized tanks. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{The saprobic values and indicator weights used in the Slovenian saprobic
   system are reappraised using data from the 1990 to 95 river quality
   surveys of Slovenia. The conceptual basis of the reappraisal is
   described and then formulated mathematically. The analysis is based on
   1106 biological samples and covers 300 taxa. The results are expressed
   in terms of revised saprobic values and indicator weights that mirror
   the ones previously assigned by ecological experts. The most significant
   differences between original and revised values are highlighted and
   discussed. It is concluded that: (a) the revised values and weights are
   more representative of their `true' values than are the original values
   and weights, but that it would be premature to consider them definitive;
   (b) the analytical method provides a sound data-based approach to the
   revision of saprobic values and indicator weights; and (c) the method
   could help to improve and harmonise the various saprobic systems
   currently in use across Europe. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Genotoxicity of halogenated by-products obtained by chlorination of
   humic acid in water was evaluated in the presence of bromide ions (Br-),
   After the halogenated humic acid solution was made to flow through
   CSP800 cartridge, absorbed substances were elated with dimethyl
   sulfoxide or acetone, and subjected to mutagenicity assays and to
   analysis of trihalomethanes (THMs). Mutagenic activity was measured by
   Ames tests using S. typhimurium TA100 strain without metabolic
   activation, and by the frequencies of micronuclei formation using
   cultured Chinese hamster lung cells (CHL/IU) in vitro. A powerful effect
   of bromide ions in chlorinated humic acid solutions was observed on the
   reverse mutation and micronuclei formations. The formations of total
   THMs and more brominated THMS were also enhanced in the presence of
   bromide ions, The ratio of {[}Br-/Cl-] regulated the composition and
   concentrations of THMs intensely, and the rate of substitution of Br (-)
   was greater than that of chloride ions (Cl-). The increments of the
   mutagenicity and total THMs formed in chlorinated solutions were
   observed in parallel with the concentration of Br- or Cl-. From the
   observations, it was concluded that the increasing mutagenicity might be
   caused by the increasing chlorinated and/or brominated by-products. (C)

Abstract = {{Freeze-thaw conditioning effectively dewaters alum and activated
   sludges, but it works better on alum sludge than it does on activated
   sludge. The main difference between alum sludge and activated sludge is
   that activated sludge has high concentrations of both dissolved organic
   material and ions. Dissolved organic material and ions may possibly
   alter the freezing process and decrease the effectiveness of freeze-thaw
   conditioning on activated sludge. The objective of this study is to
   investigate the effect of dissolved organic material and cations on
   freeze-thaw conditioning of sludges, and to improve the effectiveness of
   freeze-thaw conditioning on activated sludge. The results of this study
   show that although protein, carbohydrate and cation concentrations in
   activated sludge supernatant are initially high, they dramatically
   increase after freeze-thaw conditioning. The increase is likely to come
   from the release of extracellular and intracellular material to sludge
   supernatant. The observed increase in the DNA concentration in activated
   sludge supernatant after freeze-thaw conditioning indicates that
   freeze-thaw causes cell disruption. Alum sludge supernatant, on the
   other hand, initially contains low concentrations of proteins,
   carbohydrates and cations which do not noticeably change after
   freeze-thaw conditioning, When ECPs (extracellular polymers) and cations
   are extracted from activated sludge before freeze-thaw conditioning, the
   sludge settles and dewaters better after the freeze-thaw. The resulting
   aggregates are smaller and denser resembling the ``coffee ground{''}
   aggregates of alum sludge. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Modelling the discharge of parasitic protozoa into surface water and the
   dispersion in rivers and streams gives insight into the contribution of
   the different sources of environmental contamination and in the
   transmission of these organisms from the point of discharge to drinking
   water abstraction points and bathing sites. We tested the applicability
   of emission (PROMISE) and dispersion (WATNAT) models developed for
   chemical pollutants to describe the environmental behaviour of
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia in the Netherlands. The annual load of
   Cryptosporidium and Giardia in domestic wastewater was 3.2 x 10(11) and
   3.8 x 10(14), respectively, The majority (85\%) of the Cryptosporidium
   oocysts was discharged with effluent of wastewater treatment plants,
   while the majority (82\%) of the Giardia cysts was discharged with
   untreated wastewater discharges and sewer overflows. The estimated
   annual import through the river Rhine and Meuse was 3.2 x 10(14)
   Cryptosporidium oocysts and 2.1 x 10(15) Giardia cysts, of which the
   river Rhine contributed 87 and 66\%, respectively. This outweighed the
   total load of the discharges of treated and untreated wastewater in the
   Netherlands. The combination of PROMISE and,WATNAT predicted
   concentrations of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in surface water that were
   in the same order of magnitude as the concentrations that were observed
   at 5 of the 6 sites compared. At a site with primarily agricultural
   contamination, the models predicted concentrations that were 1
   (10)log-unit lower than the observed concentrations. This is a first
   step in the direction of a quantitative description of the transmission
   cycle of Cryptosporidium and Giardia through water. The use of these
   models combines observational occurrence data and experimental data From
   laboratory survival studies into a single integrated description. The
   description needs further improvement by incorporation of agricultural
   run-off and increasing the number and time frame of input monitoring
   data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Atl rights reserved.}},

   source. Cultures showed increases of between 50\% and 143\% in levels of
   phosphate uptake from the medium when the growth pH was 5.5 rather than
   7.5. Of 100 individual sludge microbial isolates studied, 34
   demonstrated such acid-stimulated luxury phosphate uptake; the optimum
   pH for the process was shown to lie between 5.0 and 6.5. Enhanced
   phosphate removal by these isolates was accompanied by increases of
   between 2 and 10.5-fold in their polyphosphate content; this was
   visualised as intracellular inclusions, Acid-stimulated luxury phosphate
   uptake by environmental microorganisms is a previously-unrecognised

Abstract = {{Degradation of Aroclor 1242 was studied in granular biofilm reactors
   with limited aeration. An aerobic biphenyl degrader, Rhodococcus sp. M5,
   was used to supplement a natural bacterial population present in a
   ``bioaugmented{''} reactor, while the ``non-bioaugmented{''} reactor
   only contained natural granular sludge. The bioaugmentation, however
   appeared to have no effect on the reactor performance. Aroclor
   measurements showed its disappearance in both reactors with only 16-19\%
   of Aroclor recovered from the reactor biomass and effluent.
   Simultaneously, a chlorine balance indicated that dechlorination
   occurred at a specific rate of 1.43 mg PCB (g volatile suspended solids)
   (-1) d (-1), which was comparable to the observed rate of Aroclor
   disappearance. Intermediates detected in both reactors were biphenyl,
   benzoic acid, and mono-hydroxybiphenyls. This suggests that a
   near-complete mineralization of Aroclor can be achieved in a
   single-stage anaerobic/aerobic system due to a combination of reductive
   and oxidative degradation mechanisms. Crown Copyright (C) 2001 Published

Abstract = {{Petrochemical industry bio-sludge was pyrolyzed to investigate the
   composition and pore size distribution of pyrolytic residue. Results
   indicated that the carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen concentrations could
   be reduced after an increase in pyrolytic temperature. The trace element
   analysis indicated that Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, K, Cu, Sr, and Sb concentrated
   during the pyrolytic process. When forty grams of pre-dried sludge were
   pyrolyzed at various pyrolytic temperatures, the transfers from the gas
   phase to liquid phase to residue were from 21.2 to 36.0\%, from 49.0 to
   70.0\%, and from 8.3 to 16.5\%. Results of the pore size distribution
   examination indicated that the mesopore had the greatest effect on the
   bio-sludge pyrolysis, The optimal pyrolytic temperatures and times were
   approximately 800 degreesC for 30 min and 900 degreesC for 10 min. The
   conceptual model can reasonably explain the pore structure development
   during the pyrolysis process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Inactivation of bovine-derived C. parvum oocysts was studied at
   bench-scale in oxidant demand free 0.05M phosphate buffer using free
   chlorine alone or ozone followed by free chlorine at temperatures of 1
   degreesC, 10 degreesC and 22 degreesC at pH 6. Animal infectivity using
   neonatal CD-1 mice was used for evaluation of oocyst viability after
   treatment. Kinetic models based on the linear Chick-Watson model were
   developed for free chlorine inactivation and ozone/free chlorine
   sequential inactivation for 0.4 or 1.6 log-units of ozone primary kill.
   At 22 degreesC, ozone pre-treatment increased the efficacy of free
   chlorine for about 4-6 times depending on the level of ozone primary
   kills. Gross kills of the ozone/free chlorine sequential inactivation
   were a function of ozone primary kills and increased linearly with the
   free chlorine C(avg)t (arithmetic average of the initial and final
   residual x contact time) product, Temperature was critical for both
   single and sequential inactivation, and the efficacy of free chlorine
   after 1.6 log-units of ozone primary inactivation decreased by a factor
   of 1.8 for every 10 degreesC temperature decrease. Given an ozone
   primary kill of 1.6 log-units, the free chlorine C(avg)t products
   required for a gross kill of 3.0 log-units were 1000, 2000 and 3300 mg
   min/L for 22 degreesC, 10 degreesC and 1 degreesC, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{This study involves the rnicrofiltration (MF) of secondary effluent from
   a sequencing batch reactor processing industrial waste. The MF unit was
   a hollow fibre module with gas backwash capability, and operated with
   pumped permeate (controlled flux) and dead-end, crossfiow or
   intermittent feed. The results showed that crossflow had no effect on
   flux and that intermittent dead-end filtration was less productive than
   non-intermittent operation. For dead-end filtration the cycle-time
   between gas backwashes depends very significantly on the imposed flux
   (varying from about 100 min at 30 L/m(2)h to about 5 min at 90 L/m(2) h)
   and the feed solids content. Optimal operation has to balance operating
   (energy for backwash) costs and the capital (membrane area) costs. Cost
   analysis based on capital and energy costs indicates that for lower
   energy cost the unit needs to be operated at lower imposed flux but to
   minimise total cost it is necessary to operate the unit above 60 L/m(2)
   h imposed flux depending on the maximum transmembrane pressure (TMP)
   allowed before back washing. Further analysis of TMP profiles showed
   that membrane resistance increased over time towards a maximum, which
   tended to increase with imposed flux. This implies more frequent
   chemical cleaning for high flux operation. Specific cake resistances
   were deduced from the profiles and indicated cake compression at higher
   flux and larger maximum TMP. Results of long-term trials are also
   reported. Water quality analysis shows consistent quality of permeate
   regardless of operating conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The transport potential of Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) through
   intermittent, unsaturated, sand filters used for water and wastewater
   treatment was investigated using a duplicated, 2(3) factorial design
   experiment performed in bench-scale, sand columns. Sixteen columns (dia
   = 15 cm, L = 60 cm) were dosed eight times daily for up to 61 days with
   65,000 C. parvum oocysts per liter at 15 degreesC. The effects of water
   quality, media grain size, and hydraulic loading rates were examined.
   Effluent samples were tested for pH, turbidity, and oocyst content. C.
   parvum effluent concentrations were determined by staining oocysts on
   polycarbonate filters and enumerating using epifluorescent microscopy.
   At completion, the columns were dismantled and sand samples were taken
   at discrete depths within the columns. These g samples were washed in a
   surfactant solution and the oocysts were enumerated using immunomagnetic
   separation techniques.
   The fine-grained sand columns (d(50) = 0.31 mm) effectively removed
   oocysts under the variety of conditions examined with low concentrations
   of oocysts infrequently detected in the effluent. Coarse-grained media
   columns (d(50) = 1.40 nim) yielded larger numbers of oocysts which were
   commonly observed in the effluent regardless of operating conditions.
   Factorial design analysis indicated that grain size was the variable
   which most affected the oocyst effluent concentrations in these
   intermittent filters. Loading rate had a significant effect when
   coarse-grained media was used and lesser effect with fine-grained media
   while the effect of feed composition was inconclusive. No correlations
   between turbidity, pH, and effluent oocyst concentrations were found.
   Pore-size calculations indicated that adequate space for oocyst
   transport existed in the filters. It was therefore concluded that
   processes other than physical straining mechanisms are mainly
   responsible for the removal of C. parvum oocysts from aqueous fluids in
   intermittent sand filters used under the conditions studied in this
   research. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   dihydroxydibenzothiophenes were identified as reaction intermediates. It
   is proposed that dibenzothiophene is oxidized by OH radical to
   hydroxy-dibenzothiophenes and then to dihydroxy-dibenzothiophenes.
   Kinetic analysis suggests that approximately 72\% of the
   dibenzothiophene decomposition occurred via Oil radical addition. A
   pathway and a kinetic model for the sonochemical decomposition of
   dibenzothiophene in aqueous solution are proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The relative (unsaturated) solubility and sorption of
   2,2',5,5'-tetrachlorobiphenyl have been studied along an estuarine
   salinity gradient. The aqueous compound was salted out with increasing
   salinity and an aqueous salting constant of about 0.0021 g(-1) was
   derived. Sorption of the compound to estuarine particles increased with
   increasing salinity for a range of particle concentrations, but the
   magnitude of this effect (sorption salting constants of about
   0.005-0.011 g(-1)) indicated that salting out of the aqueous phase was
   not solely responsible. It is suggested that the hydrophobicity of
   sediment organic matter is enhanced by its interaction with seawater
   ions through a reduction in the charge of the particle surface and,
   possibly, modification of the structure of the organic matter.
   Examination of literature data on the sorption of neutral organic
   compounds to estuarine sediment indicates a general increase in sorption
   with increasing salinity which can be empirically defined by a salting
   equation. Although charge reduction of estuarine particles is a general
   observation, it is not possible to establish the general significance of
   this effect (or any other form of salting out of sediment organic
   matter) on the sorption of organic compounds in estuaries because
   appropriate site- and compound-specific aqueous salting constants are
   unavailable.
   Increased sorption at high salinities has obvious implications for the
   disposal and transport of organic chemicals in estuaries. However, the
   inverse dependency of sediment-water partitioning on particle
   concentration is likely to be of at least equal significance in
   macrotidal environments where sediment resuspension occurs. An empirical
   model, combining the effects of salinity and particle concentration, is
   proposed for deriving first-order estimates of the partitioning of
   neutral organic compounds in estuaries. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The partitioning of nonpolar organic contaminants to marine sediments is
   considered to be controlled by the amount of organic carbon present.
   However, several studies propose that other characteristics of sediments
   may affect the partitioning of contaminants. For this exploratory
   analysis, we measured 19 sediment characteristics from five marine
   sediments and 11 characteristics of humic acids extracted from the
   sediments. These characteristics included elemental composition, grain
   size, soot carbon, polarity indices and molar ratios. Each individual
   characteristic and combinations of these characteristics were then used
   to normalize partition coefficients (K-p) generated for three organic
   contaminants: lindane, fluoranthene and a tetrachlorinated biphenyl
   (PCB). A coefficient of variation (CV) was then calculated for each
   contaminant to determine which normalization characteristic
   (individually or in combination) resulted in the lowest variability in
   partitioning between study sediments. For lindane and the PCB,
   normalization by the amount of sediment organic carbon resulted in the
   lowest variability in partition coefficients with CVs of 16.2\% and
   37.7\%, respectively. However, normalization of fluoranthene by silt
   content resulted in lower CVs than those generated by organic carbon
   normalization: 31.0\% vs. 37.6\%. Normalization of contaminants K-p's by
   combined values of sediment characteristics resulted in lower CVs but
   only by a few percent. Using humic acid characteristics, humic organic
   carbon reduced variability between sediments most effectively. But only
   the normalized fluoranthene values had a CV (i.e., 25.4\%) lower than
   the one based on normalization by sediment characteristics. When
   combined, humic acid characteristics resulted in lower CVs than
   normalization by individual or combinations of sediment characteristics
   for fluoranthene and the PCB with CVs of 19.3\% and 28.7\%,
   respectively. This analysis indicates variability associated with the
   partitioning of some organic contaminants to marine sediments can be
   further reduced when normalization by sediment characteristics other
   than organic carbon are utilized. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of both living and dry cells of Gloeothece magna, a
   non-toxic freshwater cyanobacterium, to adsorb cadmium and manganese is
   demonstrated in this study. Chlorophyll a content of living cells was
   not influenced by either cadmium or manganese concentrations, indicating
   that adsorption of both Cd2+ and Mn2+ by living cells of G. magna, was
   independent of the metabolic state of the organism. Moreover, the
   adsorption of both Cd2+ and Mn2+ to living cells and dry cells, was
   dependent on the metal concentrations, and fitted the Freundlich
   adsorption isotherm. However, dry cells had larger binding capacity for
   both Cd2+ (K-f = 912.6) and Mn2+ (K-f = 2398) than living cells (K-f =
   151.4 \& 63, respectively). The role of the capsular polysaccharides,
   the main constituents of the cyanobacterial envelope, in binding these
   two metals was also studied. Polysaccharide extracts of this organism
   adsorbed high amounts of both Cd2+ (115-425 mug mg(-1)) and Mn2+
   (473-906 mug mg(-1)). This study suggests that G. magna would probably
   be cultured in water bodies contaminated by heavy metals to ameliorate
   their toxicity. Also dry material of this cyanobacterium being a
   non-toxic species, could be used as a safe biofilter to remove toxic
   metals from drinking water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a serious environmental problem in the
   mining industry. The present work describes electrolytic reduction of
   solutions of synthetic AMD, comprising FeSO4/H2SO4 and CuSO4/H2SO4, in
   flow-through cells whose anode and cathode compartments were separated
   using ion exchange membranes. In the case of FeSO4/H2SO4 at constant
   flow rate, the pH of the effluent from the catholyte increased
   progressively with current at a variety of cathodes, due to electrolytic
   reduction of H+ ions to elemental hydrogen. Near-quantitative removal of
   iron was achieved by sparging air into the catholyte effluent, thereby
   precipitating iron outside the electrochemical cell, and avoiding
   fouling of the electrodes. The anode reaction was the oxidation of water
   to O-2, a proton-releasing process. Using cation exchange membranes and
   sodium sulfate as the supporting electrolyte in the anode compartment,
   the efficiency of the process was compromised at high currents by
   transport of H+ competitively with Na+ from the anode to the cathode
   compartments. Higher efficiencies were obtained when anion exchange
   membranes were used, and in this case no additional supporting
   electrolyte other than dilute H2SO4 was needed, the net reaction being
   the electrochemically driven transfer of the elements of H2SO4 from the
   cathode to the anode compartments. Current efficiencies similar to 50\%
   were achieved, the loss of efficiency being accounted for by ohmic
   heating of the solutions. In the case of CuSO4/H2SO4 and anion exchange
   membranes at high currents, reduction of Cu2+ and H+ ions and transport
   of SO42- ions out of the catholyte caused unacceptably high potentials
   to be generated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of temperature was studied on the efficiency of soluble COD
   removal and bacterial community development during the aerobic
   biological treatment of a pharmaceutical wastewater. Using wastewater
   and bacterial inoculum obtained from the full-scale facility treating
   this wastewater, batch laboratory cultures were operated at 5 degreesC
   intervals from 30 degreesC to 70 degreesC. Following four culture
   transfers to allow for bacterial acclimation, residual soluble COD
   levels were measured and bacterial community fingerprints were obtained
   by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR)-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. Soluble COD removal
   efficiency declined as temperature increased from 30 degreesC (62\%) to
   60 degreesC (38\%). Biological treatment of this wastewater failed to
   occur at temperatures higher than 60 degreesC. Gradual shifts in
   bacterial community structure were detected as temperature increased,
   including a concomitant reduction in the number of different bacterial
   populations. The impact of temperature on a two-stage biological
   treatment process was also compared. Better soluble COD removal was
   achieved when both reactors were operated at 30 degreesC compared to a
   system where the two stages were consecutively operated at 55 degreesC
   and 30 degreesC. These results indicate that operation of aerobic
   biological wastewater treatment reactors at elevated temperatures can
   have adverse effects on process performance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Limited understanding of the physical and chemical processes involved in
   membrane processes affects their widespread application in drinking
   water treatment. Insight into these processes was attained through a
   systematic manipulation of solution chemistry in membrane filtration
   with three `loose' nanofiltration membranes. Eighteen known solutions
   were created varying pH, ionic strength, and major cation valence in the
   presence of a commercial humic acid. The membrances varied as well,
   including a non-ionic hydrophobic, a non-ionic hydrophilic, and an
   anionic hydrophilic membrane surface. Specific membrane productivity and
   TOC and conductivity rejection were monitored.
   In all cases, the presence of divalent cations decreased the rejection
   of both conductivity and organic matter. Divalent cations also greatly
   increased the rate of productivity decline over equivalent tests in
   solutions with monovalent cations. The most hydrophobic membrane had the
   greatest productivity decline rate under all solution conditions. The
   lowest ionic strength solutions showed the greatest TOC and conductivity
   rejection and the greatest rate of productivity decline for each of the
   membranes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of contaminant reduction by zero-valent iron metal (Fe-0)
   have highlighted the role of iron oxides at the metal water interface
   and the effect that sorption has at the oxide water interface on
   contaminant reduction kinetics. The results suggest that a variety of
   organic surface-active substances might enhance or inhibit contaminant
   degradation, depending on the degree to which they promote
   solubilization, sorption, and/or reaction. Of particular interest is the
   effect of natural organic matter (NOM), because of its ubiquitous
   presence in natural waters and amphiphilic properties; anthropogenic
   surfactants, because of their use in groundwater remediation; and
   certain quinones, which represent the redox-active functional groups
   associated with NOM. In this study, no well-defined effects of these
   substances were found on the reduction of nitro benzene by Fe-0, but the
   reduction of carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene (TCE) was
   inhibited by NOM. Results with carbon tetrachloride showed that the
   inhibitory effect of humic acids was greater than fulvic acids, but that
   several quinonoid NOM model compounds (juglone, lawsone, and
   anthraquinone disulfonate) increased the rate of reduction by Fe-0.
   Isotherms for adsorption of TCE and NOM onto Fe-0 showed evidence of
   competition for surface sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the necessity of measuring
   both assimilable organic carbon (AOC) and biodegradable dissolved
   organic carbon (BDOC) as indicators of bacterial regrowth potential. AOC
   and BDOC have often been measured separately as indicators of bacterial
   regrowth, or together as indicators of bacterial regrowth and
   disinfection by-product formation potential, respectively. However, this
   study proposes that both AOC and BDOC should be used as complementary
   measurements of bacterial regrowth potential. In monitoring of
   full-scale membrane filtration, it was determined that nanofiltration
   (NF) removed over 90\% of the BDOC while allowing the majority of the
   AOC through. Heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) remained low during the
   entire period of monitoring due to high additions of disinfectant
   residual. In a two-year monitoring of a water treatment plant that
   switched its treatment process from chlorination to chlorination and
   ozonation, it was observed that the plant effluent AOC increased by
   127\% while BDOC increased by 49\% after the introduction of ozone. Even
   though AOC is a fraction of BDOC, measuring only one of these parameters
   can potentially under- or over-estimate the bacterial regrowth potential
   of the water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) plays a significant role in fouling
   microfiltration membranes in drinking water treatment processes even
   though the NOM is retained only to a small extent. The aim of this study
   was to obtain a better understanding of the interactions between the
   fractional components of NOM and microfiltration membranes. Filtration
   experiments were performed using 0.22 mum hydrophobic and hydrophilic
   polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes in a stirred-cell system on the
   NOM isolated from three Australian surface waters. As expected, the
   fouling rate for the hydrophobic membrane was considerably greater than
   for the hydrophilic membrane. Focusing on the hydrophobic membrane, it
   was shown that the high molecular weight fraction of NOM (> 30 kDa) was
   responsible for the major flux decline. Filtration tests on the four
   fractions of NOM isolated on the basis of hydrophobicity and charge
   using non-functionalised and anionic resins revealed that the fouling
   potential for the three waters was hydrophilic neutral > hydrophobic
   acids > transphilic acids > hydrophilic charged. The low-aromatic
   hydrophilic neutral compounds were the main determinant of the rate and
   extent of flux decline. This was linked to the colloidal size fraction
   (> 30 kDa) and to the selective concentration of calcium in the fraction
   leading to organics-Ca2+ bridging. It was also shown that the higher the
   aromaticity of the NOM the greater the flux decline, and the aromatics
   mainly resided in the hydrophobic acids fraction. Overall, the fouling
   mechanism controlling the flux decline involved the combined effects of
   adsorptive and colloidal fouling by the hydrophilic neutral fraction in
   the internal pore structure of the membrane. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) as a primary disinfectant and
   pre-oxidant in drinking water treatment is being explored as an
   alternative to chlorine for reducing disinfection by-product formation
   and to assure compliance with United States Environmental Protection
   Agency's Stage 1 Disinfection/ Disinfection By-Products Rule. However,
   the ClO2 by-product chlorite ion (ClO2-) is also regulated by the same
   regulation. Ferrous iron (Fe(II)) has been shown to effectively reduce
   chlorite ion to chloride ion (Cl-) and this study was conducted to
   evaluate the impact on overall treatment process performance due to the
   ferric hydroxide solids that form from the reaction. Ferrous iron
   application was explored at three different points in a pilot-scale
   water treatment system: pre-rapid mix, pre-settling and pre-filter.
   Chlorite ion concentrations were effectively reduced from 2 mg/L to less
   than 0.3 mg/L using an Fe(II) dose of approximately 6 mg/L for all
   trials. Fe(II) addition at the rapid mix caused no adverse effects and,
   in fact, allowed for reduction of the alum dose due to the newly formed
   ferric hydroxide acting as a supplemental coagulant. An increase of 241
   and 247\% of total suspended solids influent to the filter process was
   observed when Fe(II) was applied at the pre-settling and pre-filter
   locations. Pilot-scale filter runs during these trials were less than 2
   It and never obtained true steady state conditions. Jar testing was
   performed to better understand the nature of the ferric hydroxide solids
   that are formed when Fe(II) was oxidized to Fe(III) and to explore the
   effectiveness of Fe(II) addition at intermediate stages in the
   flocculation process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper develops batch-mixed treatment with zero-valent iron as a
   point-of-use technology, appropriate for arsenic removal from water
   stored within rural homes in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, where
   arsenic poisoning has affected an estimated 20 million people, Batch
   tests with iron yielded the following results: (1) High arsenic removal
   (> 93\%) was achieved from highly arsenated waters (2000 mug/L) over
   short contact times (0.5-3 h) with iron filings added at doses ranging
   from 2500 to 625 mg/L; (2) Most rapid arsenic removal was observed in
   head-space free systems with sulphates present in solution, while
   phosphate buffers were observed to inhibit arsenic removal by iron; (3)
   The arsenic removed from water was found to be strongly bound to the
   elemental iron filings, such that the treated water could be decanted
   and iron could be reused at least 100 times; (4) Some iron dissolved
   into water over the contact period, at concentrations ranging from 100
   to 300 mug/L, which are within safe drinking water limits. These results
   indicate that, with appropriate assessment of water chemistry in the
   affected region, treatment with metallic iron followed by simple
   decantation can be used as a practical, in-home, point-of-use technique
   for reducing human exposure to arsenic in drinking water. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Wastewater treatment results in the production of large quantities of
   sludge. Agricultural use is an interesting alternative provided that the
   health risks are taken into account. In France, a decree (1998) defines
   ``sanitized{''} sludge as sludge that has been treated so that pathogens
   (Salmonella, enteroviruses. viable nematode eggs) Lire no longer
   detectable. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of various
   sludge treatment, on 2 types of pathogens (Salmonella and nematode
   eggs). We also assessed the levels of micro-organisms that indicate
   Caecal contamination (E. coli, Enterococci, sulfite-reducing anaerobes
   spores). Various treatment processes were analyzed: 4 biological, 3
   chemical, I heat, 2 storage and 4 sampling campaigns were carried out.
   Concerning the parasitological contamination of sludge at the entrance
   of all sites, concentrations of total nematode eggs and viable nematode
   eggs were highly heterogeneous (respectively, from 2 to 53 eggs/10 g DM
   and from 2 to 45 eggs/10 g DM) with viable eggs present in all samples,
   The total concentration of nematode eggs in the sludge was not greatly
   affected by treatment or storage, and was in the range < 1 - 66 eggs/10
   g DNF However, the situation was different for mean viable egg counts.
   For four treatments, no viable eggs were detected. Mesophilic processes
   are inefficient at eliminating viable nematode eggs. Salmonella were
   systematically detected in all sludge samples at the entry to the
   station, except for limed sludge intended for storage. At the end of
   four treatments Salmonella had been totally eliminated. For the fecal
   contamination indicators, the largest decrease in E. coli contamination
   was observed following timing and after thermophilic treatment, The
   mesophilic treatments resulted in very small decreases in contamination.
   A similar pattern was observed with Enterococci. For the spores of
   sulfite-reducing anaerobe bacteria, with the exception of heat
   treatment, which reduced contamination by 3.2 log units, the maximum
   decrease in contamination was 1.7 log. For storage of sludge, E. coli
   and Enterococci levels had decreased at first but then increased between
   6 and 8 months of storage. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A natural kaolinite (KGa-1b) was treated with the surfactant
   hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) to a level twice that of
   the cation exchange capacity (CEC). Sorption of nitrate. arsenate, and
   chromate by the resultant organo-kaolinite was then quantified. Sorption
   of each oxyanion was well-described by the Langmuir isotherm. Sorption
   of nitrate was the greatest. with a Langmuir sorption maximum of 24
   mmol/kg, although chromate showed the highest sorption affinity of 20
   L/kg. Sorption of nitrate. arsenate, and chromate on organo-kaolinite
   was at least two orders of magnitude greater than their sorption on
   unmodified kaolinite. Desorption of the bromide counterion indicated
   that each of the oxyanions was retained by ion exchange on an HDTMA
   bilayer formed on the organokaolinite. Chromate sorption on the
   organo-kaolinite was unaffected by solution pH in the range 5-9, but
   decreased at pH 11 due to competition of OH- for anion exchange sites.
   Similarly, chromate exchange by organo-kaolinite was reduced in the
   presence of high background levels of chloride. Chromate was effectively
   retained when flowing through a packed bed of organo-kaotinite: after an
   input of more than 40 pore volumes. the effluent concentration of
   chromate was less than 10\% of the input concentration. and 90\% of the
   original HDTMA remained on the organo-kaolinite. The results demonstrate
   that properly prepared organoclays can remove oxyanions, as well as
   nonpolar organics, from contaminated waters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The laboratory-scale filtration tests of Giardia cysts and
   Cryptosporidium oocysts in both 2 mm-Phi glass beads and 2 mm-Phi
   polystyrene beads filters were conducted to investigate their filtration
   behaviors. The protozoan parasites were used as target particles. while
   the chemical system altered by changing the electrolyte concentration
   and pH, The results significantly indicate that ionic strength have a
   positive effect on the removal efficiencies for Giardia cysts and
   Cryptosporidium oocysts. The removal efficiency of two filters for
   Giardia cysts slightly decreased from pH 2.4 to 8.7 and decreased
   significantly in pH as pH up to 8.7, while that for Cryptosporidium
   slightly rippled beyond pH 8.7, and with the decrease in pH up to pH
   8.7. The experimental collision efficiencies from the interactions
   between colloids and the filter media were calculated with a
   semi-empirical approach of the single sphere model and clean-bed
   filtration theory. The results also indicated that experimental
   collision efficiencies for (oo)cysts corresponded to the (oo)cysts
   removal efficiencies in all trials, and oocysts exhibits higher
   collision efficiencies than cysts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Atmospheric acidification of catchment-lake ecosystems may provide
   natural conditions for the in-lake control of P cycling. This process is
   based on the elevated transport of aluminum from acidified soils and its
   subsequent precipitation in the water body and is described for strongly
   acidified forest lakes, acidified and circumneutral reservoirs, and a
   moderately acidified alpine lake. In water bodies with episodically or
   permanently acidified inflows a pH gradient develops between lake water
   and tributaries due to: (i) neutralization of acidic inflows after
   mixing with waters with undepleted carbonate buffering system, and/or
   (ii) the in-lake alkalinity generation dominated by biochemical removal
   of NO3- and SO42- With the pH increasing towards neutrality, ionic Al
   species hydrolyze and form colloidal Al hydroxides (Al-part) with large
   specific surfaces and strong ability to bind orthophosphate from the
   liquid phase. Moreover, Al-part settles and increases the P sorption
   capacity of the sediment. The presence of Al-part on the bottom reduces
   orthophosphate release from sediments after its liberation from ferric
   oxyhydroxides during anoxia because Al-part is not sensitive to redox
   changes. Consequently, the natural in-lake P inactivation may be
   expected in any water body with elevated Al input and a pH gradient
   between its inlet and outlet. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{1,4-dioxane is one of the most recalcitrant and toxic contaminants in
   the subsurface. This study investigated the potential to enhance dioxane
   biodegradation in both planted and implanted soil. by adding the
   dioxane-degrading actinomycete, Amycolata sp. CB 1190. Dioxane was not
   removed within 120 days in sterile controls or in viable microcosms not
   amended with CB 1190, Poplar root extract (40 mg/L as COD) stimulated
   dioxane degradation in bioaugmented soil, and 100 mg/L dioxane were
   removed within 45 days. Other co-substrates that enhanced dioxane
   degradation by CB1190 include tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 1-butanol. while
   glucose and soil extract did not affect dioxane degradation. The
   stimulatory effect of THF was partly due to enhanced enzyme induction.
   while that of root extract and 1-butanol was attributed to additional
   growth of CB 1190. In another experiment with dioxane added at 10
   mg/kg-soil, reactors planted with hybrid poplar trees removed (by
   evapotranspiration and biodegradation in the root zone) more dioxane
   within 26 days than unplanted reactors. regardless of whether CB1190 was
   added. Nevertheless, CB1190 enhanced mineralization of {[}C-14]-dioxane
   in all experiments, This enhancement was more pronounced in unplanted
   soil because plant uptake reduced the availability of dioxane for
   microbial degradation. These results suggest that bioaugmented
   phytoremediation is an attractive alternative to remove dioxane from
   shallow contaminated sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aggregates often have mass fractal properties and there is, therefore,
   considerable interest in the hydrodynamics of mass fractal aggregates.
   There is no appropriate model in the literature to account for the
   non-homogeneous permeability within mass fractal aggregates. The new
   model proposed treats an individual aggregate as a self-similar object
   made up of a settling swarm of permeable spheres which are themselves
   made up of a settling swarm of sub-spheres and so on to the level of
   primary particles. This staged approach makes appropriate use of the
   fractal description of the aggregate to account for nonhomogeneous
   distribution of porosity and quantify the drag correction for flow
   through effects, It also allows the settling properties to be quantified
   for multiple level aggregate structures, such as those formed from
   microfloes or by restructuring. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Seven wastewater sludges of different origins and types were used as an
   alternate culture medium for producing Bacillus thuringiensis variety
   kurstaki HD-1. The sludge samples were used under three different
   preparations: without pre-treatment, with acid treatment (hydrolysed
   sludge) and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation of the
   hydrolysed sludge. The sludge composition varied widely with origin and
   the type of sludge. Growth and sporulation were evaluated by the total
   viable cell count and spore count of the preparations. Growth,
   sporulation and endotoxin production were affected by the sludge origin.
   Hydrolysed sludge gave the highest viable cell and spore counts while
   the liquid phase (supernatant) gave the lowest. Non-hydrolysed primary
   sludge from Valcartier was unable to sustain bacterial growth because of
   its low pH. Bioassays were conducted against larvae of spruce budworm to
   evaluate entomotoxic potential of the preparations obtained. In general,
   sludge hydrolysis increased the entomotoxicity yields. Similar
   entomotoxicity was observed in Black Lake secondary sludge (4100 IU/muL)
   as that obtained in the reference soya medium (3800 IU/muL). The use of
   the sludge supernatant (liquid phase) was not recommended due to the low
   entomotoxic potential obtained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Tetrazolium reduction assays, phospholipid analysis, and 16S rRNA (rDNA)
   sequence analysis were applied to assess the distribution, composition
   and activity of microbial communities developing in biofilters treating
   non-ozonated and ozonated drinking water, The response of media-attached
   biomass to both operating temperature (3 degrees C vs. > 12 degrees C)
   and ozone application point was assessed. As judged by
   2-(p-iodo-phenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-s-phenyl tetrazolium chloride (INT)
   reduction, the dehydrogenase activity in biofilter systems that were
   operated with non-ozonated water was 55\% lower than in identical
   filters operating with ozonated water. There was no significant
   difference between the microbiological activity measured in a biofilter
   series treating ozonated water and an identical series where ozonated
   water was introduced at an intermediate point. The biomass levels in
   biofilter systems that were operated with ozonated water were 47\%
   higher on average than identical systems operated with non-ozonated
   water. Operating temperature had no significant impact on total biomass
   levels however, specific dehydrogenase activity was 70\% higher in
   systems operated at ambient temperatures ( > 12 degreesC) than in
   systems held at 3 degrees C. Phospholipid and rDNA analysis suggests
   that there was a community structure response to ozone application and
   operating temperature, but no response to different ozone application
   points. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the analysis of eco toxicological bioassays the concentration of the
   test compounds is assumed to be constant. In many situations this
   assumption is questionable, as various processes may cause a substantial
   decline in the concentration during exposure. This leads to difficulties
   in the estimation of parameters that characterise the toxicity of the
   test compound. As a solution to this problem, time-varying
   concentrations are often replaced by their mean values for the
   estimation of toxicity parameters. However. Monte-Carlo simulations show
   that this approach results in biased estimates of the toxicity
   parameters. As an alternative approach, we propose models to estimate
   one important toxicity parameter, the no effect concentration, in
   situations where the concentration of the compound varies in time. These
   models are extensions of the DEBtox model (Kooijman and Bedaux, 1996)
   which is based on biological assumptions about toxicokinetics and toxic
   effects. We also propose a new approach for the estimation of toxicity
   parameters for strongly accumulating non-metabolisable compounds. This
   approach does not require any kinetics assumption. Computer simulation
   and experimental data confirm the relevance of the different proposals.

Title = {{Aerobic storage by activated sludge on real wastewater}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},

Pages = {{3833-3844}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Activated sludge processes are often operated under dynamic conditions,
   where the microbial response can include, besides of growth, several COD
   removal mechanisms, and particularly the storage in form of polymers.
   While abundant evidence of aerobic storage under dynamic conditions with
   synthetic substrates can be found (Majone et al., Water Sci. Technol.
   39(1) (1999) 61), there is still little knowledge about COD removal
   mechanisms with real activated Sludge and wastewater. The aim of the
   present paper is therefore to give a direct evidence of storage
   phenomena occurring when a real sludge is mixed with influent wastewater
   and of their influence onto OUR profiles in typical respirometric batch
   tests. For this purpose, respirometric batch tests were performed on the
   same sludge by using acetate, filtered wastewater and raw wastewater as
   carbon source along with determination of acetate uptake and storage
   polymer formation. Comparison of results obtained has shown that
   poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) storage gives always the main contribution
   to acetate removal and that in the case of wastewater PHB is also formed
   from other substrates. PHB formation clearly occurs during the high-rate
   RBCOD-phase, however for wastewater it accounts for only a fraction
   (18-22\%) of overall RBCOD removal, so calling for other unidentified
   storage compounds or other non-storage phenomena, In the low-rate SBCOD
   phase of respirogram PHB is clearly utilised in tests with acetate as
   internal reserve material once the acetate is depleted. In tests with
   filtered and raw wastewater the PHB concentration decreases much slower.
   probably because more PHB is formed due to the availability of external
   SBCOD (soluble and not). Moreover. reported OUR in the SBCOD-phase from
   filtered or raw wastewater are quite higher than those reported in batch
   tests with acetate, so confirming a main contribution of external SBCOD.
   However, the respective contributions for utilisation of previously
   stored compounds and of external SBCOD cannot be easily separated by the
   comparison of tests on filtered and raw wastewater, because both
   substrates are simultaneously present also in tests with the filtered
   wastewater. As a side consequence, the chemical-physical method for
   evaluation of true soluble and biodegradable COD tends to overestimate
   the respirometry-based RBCOD, at least for the wastewater under
   observation. Even though modelling by ASM3 (Gujer et al., Water Set.
   Technol. 39(1) (1999) 183) makes it possible to well describe the whole
   experimental behaviour, it requires that much more storage compounds are
   formed than the experimentally observed PHB. These compounds have still
   to be identified and quantified in order to confirm the conceptual
   structure of ASM3. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effluents from X-ray film developing processes feature high contaminant
   load (COD about 200 g/l). Identification of the main organics present in
   these wastewaters was performed by using liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry in electron impact mode, LC-(EI)MS. Both, unconsumed
   ingredients and sulphonate/hydroxylated derivatives and dimers yielded
   from the developing agents hydroquinone and phenidone were found to be
   the main organics contributing to the contaminant load of these
   effluents. Their potential degradation by oxidation with both photo- and
   thermal-Fenton reactions was investigated and the optimal degradation
   conditions were determined. Under these conditions the initial COD was
   reduced by about 97\% within 6 h of treatment. The intermediates
   detected by LC-(EI)MS in the oxidation of hydroquinone and phenidone
   during the treatment were essentially hydroxylated derivatives and
   dimers and the residual organic matter was mainly made up of carboxylic
   acids, Reaction pathways for the oxidation of the developing agents
   hydroquinone and phenidone were proposed. The presence of many organic
   and inorganic components in the wastewaters did not affected the
   favoured oxidation route of these developers. The results obtained allow
   to assess the reduction of costs permitted in the treatment of X-ray
   effluents with the photo- and thermal-Fenton reaction without affecting
   the degradation degree and quality of the discharge. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Constructed wetlands could be components of low-tech systems to treat
   arid reuse wastewater in arid region. A key function of the wetland
   would be to provide additional N removal. To improve design criteria. a
   sequential model of nitrogen transformations (organic N --> ammonium;
   ammonium --> nitrate; nitrate --> nitrogen gas) was successfully
   calibrated and verified for a wetland in Kingman, Arizona. A sequential
   model has the ability to ``recognize{''} species of nitrogen in the
   influent and predict species of nitrogen in the effluent. Model
   scenarios show that increasing nitrification rates in the summer and
   denitrification rates in the winter would improve nitrogen removal
   efficiencies. Several lines of evidence suggest that wintertime
   denitrification may be limited by carbon supply. Winter carbon supply
   could be augmented by routing a portion of the water through channels
   planted with dryland vegetation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Under aerobic conditions. the decay rates of purple nonsulfur bacteria
   (Rhodobacter sp.) in the light and dark follow first-order kinetics with
   rate constants of 0.22 and 0.32 day(-1), respectively. The performance
   of the conventional activated-sludge reactor (CASR) treating
   anaerobically pretreated piggery wastewater (656 1,110 mg chemical
   oxygen demand, COD/L) can be enhanced by the addition of Rhodobacter sp.
   By performing regressive and statistical analyses using the proposed
   model and experimental data. the kinetic constants k and Y-T, and the
   fraction of refractory organic materials (f) of the Rhodobacter
   sp-supplemented activated-sludge reactor (RASR) are 40\% larger, 21\%
   less. and 34\% less than those of the CASR, respectively. From
   parametric sensitivity analyses, the substrate removal efficiencies of
   the CASR and RASR are most sensitive to the parameters k and the food to

Abstract = {{The sorption of copper and cadmium ions onto bone char in single
   component systems has been studied using fixed-bed column adsorbers. The
   effects of solution flowrate, initial metal ion concentration and bone
   char particle size have been studied. A film-pore diffusion model has
   been developed to predict the fixed-bed breakthrough curves for the two
   metal ions. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to investigate
   the influence of the external mass transfer coefficient (film
   resistance), the effective diffusion coefficient (pore diffusion) and
   the solid phase loading capacity. It is round that under the
   experimental conditions employed in the study, film diffusional
   resistance was tow and the Biot numbers were relatively high.
   Furthermore. a constant effective pore diffusivity was not sufficient to
   correlate the breakthrough curves accurately and a variable dependent
   effective diffusivity was required; suggesting a possible contribution
   front surface diffusion. Since the metal ion-bone char systems take a
   long time to reach equilibrium. the solid phase loading capacity as
   predicted by the ``best-fit{''} equilibrium isotherm. was not Suitable
   for use in the diffusional mass transport model and the mass balance
   solid phase loading was utilised instead. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Flocculation of kaolinite suspensions in water using chitosan was
   studied in the pH range 5-9 and the turbidity ranging from 10 to 160
   NTU. Chitosan, in presence of trace quantities of a substance present in
   aqueous soil extracts, effectively reduces turbidity due to kaolinite by
   flocculation and settling. Flocculation efficiency is very sensitive to
   pH. and reaches a maximum at pH 7.5. The optimal chitosan concentration
   required to effect flocculation is independent of kaolinite
   concentration within the range examined. Flocculation is faster at
   higher concentrations of kaolinite and the floes are large and settle

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3909-3915}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The results of specific percolation tests are expressed in terms of
   field saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) of the soil. The specific
   tests comprise the Irish SR 6 and the UK BS 6297 standard tests and the
   inversed auger hole and square hole tests employed for the design of
   land drainage. Percolation times from these tests are converted to K-fs
   values using unit gradient theory and the Elrick and Reynolds (Soil Sci.
   142(5) (1986) 308) model which takes into account gravitational,
   pressure head and matric potential gradients. K-fs is then expressed as
   the inverse of the percolation rate times a constants in this way the
   percolation rate can be directly related to K-fs of the soil. A plot of
   K-fs against percolation rate for the Irish SR 6 and the UK BS 6297
   standard tests is asymptotic at K-fs values less than 0.2 in, d and
   greater than 0.8 m/d. This behaviour creates difficulty in setting
   limits for percolation rates in standards. Curves are provided which
   enable K-fs values to be read oil from percolation tests without the
   restrictions of head range currently enforced, for example in the Irish
   SR 6 and BS 6297 standards. Experimental measurements of percolation
   rates and K-fs were carried out on two sands in the laboratory and in
   the field on two soils. K-fs of these four materials was also measured
   using a tension infiltrometer and the Guelph permeameter. The saturated
   hydraulic conductivities (K-s) of the sands were also estimated in a
   Calling head laboratory apparatus and by the Hazen formula. There was
   good agreement between the different tests for K-fs on each material.
   Because percolation time continued to increase significantly in
   consecutive tests in the same test hole while K-fs became constant, the
   latter is a better measure of the suitability of soils for percolation.

Abstract = {{Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), including alkylated and sulfur
   derivatives. were identified and measured in the waters from three
   European remote mountain lakes during both ice-free and ice covered
   periods. The measured concentrations were in the same order in all three
   lakes (700-1100 pg.l). The PAH patterns in both dissolved and
   particulate water phases were dominated by the low molecular weight
   compounds (i.e. phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene) in Lakes Redo
   (Pyrenees) and Gossenkolle (Alps). In contrast. the high molecular
   weight (HMW) compounds (i.e. chrysene+triphenylene, benzofluoranthenes,
   benzo{[}e]pyrene) were very significant in lake Ovre Neadalsvatn
   (Caledonian). These HMW PAH correspond to mixtures originating from high
   temperature combustion processes which have been photodegraded during
   long range atmospheric transport and parallel the PAH mixtures
   encountered in the underlying lake sediments. In contrast. dissolved PAH
   exhibit temperature dependence with higher concentrations found at water
   temperatures below 6-7 degreesC reflecting higher condensation from the
   atmospheric gas phase reservoir. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The combination of ultrasound (US) and photochemistry has been used to
   degrade an aqueous solution of phenol. It was considerably more
   effective than ultrasound or ultraviolet (UV) light alone. Based on the
   results of total organic carbon (TOC) removal, it was shown that the
   synergistic action of ultrasound and ultraviolet tight existed.
   Identification of the first intermediates of the reaction (hydroquinone.
   catechol, benzoquinone and resorcin) indicates that OH radicals are
   involved in the photosonochemical degradation mechanisms. The effects of
   parameters such as pH. saturating gases, and Fe2+ on the
   photosonochemical degradation have been studied. The experimental
   results have shown that lower pH and higher concentration of dissolved
   oxygen favor the phenol degradation and that the presence of Fe2+
   enhanced TOC removal of phenol solutions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Three dose-response studies were conducted with healthy volunteers using
   different Cryptosporidium parvum isolates (IOWA, TAMU, and UCP). The
   study data were previously analyzed for median infectious dose (ID50)
   using a simple cumulative percent endpoint method (Reed and Muench.
   1938). ID(50)s were derived using two definitions of infection: one as
   subjects having oocysts detected in stool by direct fluorescence assay,
   and the other by a clinical finding of diarrhea with or without detected
   oocysts (Chappell et al., 1998: Okhuysen et al.. 1999). In the present
   study, the data were analyzed using the broader definition of infection
   (i.e., presence of oocysts in stool and/or diarrheal illness
   characteristic of cryptosporidiosis). Maximum likelihood dose-response
   parameter estimates for UCP, IOWA. and TAMU were 2980. 190, and 17.5.
   respectively. Based on these estimates, the ID(50)s of the three
   respective isolates were 2066, 132, and 12.1. The three oocyst isolates
   were considered representative of a larger population of human-infecting
   strains and analyzed as combined data using a hierarchical Bayesian
   model. Hyperparameters defined the distribution of dose-response
   parameters for the population of strains. Output from Markov Chain Monte
   Carlo analysis described posterior distributions for the hyperparameters
   and for the parameters of the IOWA, TAMU, and UCP strains. Point
   estimates of dose-response parameters produced by this analysis were
   similar to the maximum likelihood estimates. Finally, the utility of
   these results for probabilistic risk assessment was evaluated. The risk
   of infection from single oocyst doses was derived for a mixture of the
   three isolates (where IOWA. TAMU, or UCP are equally likely), and for an
   oocyst selected at random from the larger population of strains. These
   estimated risks of infection were 0.018 and 0.028. respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{Bioremediation of coal tar-contaminated soils containing polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is highly challenging because of the low
   solubility and strong sorption properties of PAHs. Five coal
   tar-contaminated soils from former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites
   were pretreated with two solvents, acetone and ethanol to enhance the
   bioavailability of the PAH compounds. The biodegradation of various PAHs
   in the pretreated soils was assessed using soil slurry reactors. The
   total PAH degradation rated: for soils pretreated with solvents were
   estimated to be about two times faster than soils that were not
   pretreated with solvents. For example, the total PAH first order
   degradation rate constants were 0.165 +/- 0.032, 0.147 +/- 0.020, and
   0.076 +/- 0.009 day(-1) for Vandalia (EXC) soil that were pretreated
   with acetone, ethanol. and with no solvent, respectively. A distinctive
   advantage for soils pretreated with solvents was the enhanced removal of
   5-ring PAH compounds such as benzo(a)pyrene and to a limited extent
   4-ring compounds such as chrysene. Even for soils with 3.5\% or more
   organic carbon content (two soils out of five), the degradation rate
   constants of chrysene were found to be two times faster than soils that
   were not pretreated. The degradation rate constants of benzo(a)pyrene
   were enhanced by 2-6 times for all five contaminated soils that were
   pretreated with solvents. To further elucidate trends that control the
   solvent treatment, the percent improvement in degradation rate constants
   (100 x rate constants for pretreated soils/rate constants for
   non-treated soils) for 16 PAHs were found to correlate well with the PAH
   partition coefficients (K-oc). Except for phenanthrene and the clay
   fraction of the soil, correlations between the percent improvement in
   degradation rates constants and several physical properties of the soils
   were poor and sporadic. This implies that the enhancement in PAH
   availability using solvent treatment was driven by the distribution of
   the PAHs between the solvent and the adsorbed PAHs. (C) 2001 Elsevier

   on aldehydes formation during oxidation with common oxidants (ozone,

   results showed that specific contents of these disinfection byproducts
   (mug mg (1) TOC) showed an increase after coagulation processes in a

Title = {{A hybrid artificial neural network as a software sensor for optimal

Abstract = {{For control and automation of biological treatment processes, lack of
   reliable on-line sensors to measure water quality parameters is one of
   the most important problems to overcome. Many parameters cannot be
   measured directly with on-line sensors. The accuracy of existing
   hardware sensors is also not sufficient and maintenance problems such as
   electrode fouling often cause trouble. This paper deals with the
   development of software sensor techniques that estimate the target water
   quality parameter from other parameters using the correlation between
   water quality parameters. We focus our attention on the preprocessing of
   noisy data and the selection of the best model feasible to the
   situation. Problems of existing approaches are also discussed. We
   propose a hybrid neural network as a software sensor inferring
   wastewater quality parameter. Multivariate regression, artificial neural
   networks (ANN), and a hybrid technique that combines principal component
   analysis as a preprocessing stage are applied to data from industrial
   wastewater processes. The hybrid ANN technique shows an enhancement of
   prediction capability and reduces the overfitting problem of neural
   networks. The result shows that the hybrid ANN technique can be used to
   extract information front noisy data and to describe the nonlinearity of
   complex wastewater treatment processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Simultaneous biological phosphorus and nitrogen removal with enhanced
   anoxic phosphate uptake was investigated in an
   anaerobic-aerobic-anoxic-aerobic sequencing batch reactor ((AO)(2) SBR),
   Significant amounts of phosphorus-accumulation organisms (PAOs) capable
   of denitrification could be accumulated in a single sludge system
   coexisting with nitrifiers. The ratio of the anoxic phosphate uptake to
   the aerobic phosphate uptake capacity was increased from 11\% to 64\% by
   introducing an anoxic phase in an anaerobic aerobic SBR. The (AO)(2) SBR
   system showed stable phosphorus and nitrogen removal performance.
   Average removal efficiencies of TOC total nitrogen. and phosphorus were
   92\%, 88\%. and 100\%. respectively. It was found that nitrite (up to 10
   mg NO2--N/l) was not detrimental to the anoxic phosphate uptake and
   could serve as an electron acceptor like nitrate. In fact. the phosphate
   uptake rate was even faster in the presence of nitrite as an electron
   acceptor compared to the presence of nitrate. It was found that on-line
   sensor values of pH, ORP, and DO were somehow related with the dynamic
   behaviours of nutrient concentrations (NH4+, NO3-, and PO43) in the SBR.
   These on-line sensor values were used as real-time control parameters to
   adjust the duration of each operational phase in the (AO)(2) SBR. The
   real-time controlled SBR exhibited better performance in the removal of
   phosphorus and nitrogen than the SBR with fixed-time operation. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented for the continuous measurement of
   chlorophyll-a concentration due to plankton, in surface water
   environments. A Turner 10-AU fluorometer equipped with the F4T5.B2/BP
   lamp (blue lamp), a Cs 5-60 equivalent excitation path filter. and a 680
   nm emission filter, has been used. This configuration allows the in
   vivo, in situ determination of chlorophyll-a by measuring the
   fluorescence due to the pigments. In field work the fluorometer, data
   logging and positioning equipment were placed aboard a manageable boat
   which navigated following a scheme of regularly spaced crossings. Some
   water samples were collected during the measurement for laboratory
   chlorophyll-a measurements by the spectrophotometric method, thus
   providing for calibration and comparison. Spatial chlorophyll-a
   concentration distributions can be easily defined in large volumes, such
   as reservoirs, etc. Two distinct environments have been monitored: in
   the Vargem das Flores reservoir chlorophyll-a concentrations varied
   between 0.7 and 2.6 mg/m(3), whereas in the Lagoa Santa lake these
   values lied in the 12 to 18 mg/m(3) range. The simplicity, versatility
   and economy of the method, added to the large amount of data that can be
   gathered in a single run, clearly justify its use in field environmental
   studies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study was performed to investigate the treatment of an industrial
   wastewater mainly containing naphthalene- and anthraquinone-sulphonic
   acids, by electro generated Fenton's reagent. The hydrogen peroxide was
   produced in situ by electrochemical reduction of oxygen on graphite-felt
   cathodes and the Fe2+ ions were also regenerated by cathodic reduction
   of Fe3+. The influence of cathode potential, Fe2+ concentration and
   electrode surface pre-treatment on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal
   and colour fading were studied. Results indicated that the higher COD
   removal was obtained in the presence of 3 mM of ferrous ions working at
   a constant potential of -1 V vs. SCE. Moreover, it was shown that both
   chemical and electrochemical pre-treatments of the cathode surface
   resulted in a decrease of COD depletion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Particles and aggregates from trickling filters Must be eliminated from
   wastewater. Usually this happens through sedimentation in humus tanks.
   Investigations to characterize these solids by way of particle size
   measurements, image analysis and particle charge measurements (zeta
   potential) are made within the scope of Research Center for Science and
   Technology ``Fundamentals of Aerobic biological wastewater treatment{''}
   (SFB 411). The particle size measuring results given within this report
   were obtained at the Ingolstadt wastewater treatment plant, Germany.
   which served as an example. They have been confirmed by similar results
   from other facilities, Particles flushed out from trickling filters will
   be partially destroyed on their way to the humus tank. A large amount of
   small particles is to be found there. On average 90\% of the particles
   are smaller than 30 mum. Particle size plays a decisive role in the
   sedimentation behaviour of solids. Small particles need sedimentation
   times that cannot be provided in settling tanks. As a result they cause
   turbidity in the final effluent. Therefore quality of sewage discharge
   suffers, and there are hardly advantages of the fixed film reactor
   treatment compared to the activated sludge process regarding
   sedimentation behaviour. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   sulphonamides were spiked into microfiltered tertiary municipal effluent
   in mug L-1 quantities. Ultrafiltration of these effluents resulted in
   better adsorbability for both the micropollutants and the background
   organic matter in the permeates compared to the feed waters. This
   behaviour seems to be caused by a reduced blocking of micropores by
   lower concentrations of high molecular weight compounds in membrane
   filtrates. A combined treatment of ultrafiltration prior to adsorption
   can therefore reduce the carbon demand for potentially harmful

   inhibited elasticity of the sludge matrix. sediment height rebound was
   commonly observed for the flocculated sludge. Also, different sludges
   could have distinct elastic responses after centrifugation. There

Abstract = {{The effect of direct exposure to solar radiation on the migration of
   vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) from unplasticized polyvinyl chloride
   (uPVC) pipes was investigated using locally manufactured and imported
   pipes. Specimens 33 cm long were used throughout the research. The
   investigation was carried out, at different times of exposure, by
   exposing one part of the specimens to the direct sunlight, while keeping
   the other part in the shade. The VCM concentration in the water was
   evaluated using the gas chromatography (GC)/head-space technique. A VCM
   concentration of 2.5 mug/l was detected after 30 days of exposure in
   direct sunlight. The original initial VCM concentration in the uPVC was
   predicted, and the diffusion rate of VCM from uPVC pipes was expressed
   as a function of time. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Electrochemical method at laboratory scale for the treatment of
   biorefractory solutions with high phenol content-1000 ppm is described.
   Total degradation of phenol was obtained at alkaline pH when NaCl was
   present using Bi-doped and pure lead dioxide electrodes. A filter press
   cell of 63 cm(2) geometric area was used for this purpose. Measurements
   of chemical oxygen demand (COD), phenol, carbon monoxide, carbon
   dioxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been used to
   characterise the electrochemical process for phenol elimination.
   It is worth noting that in the absence of NaCl, the charge efficiency of
   COD removal was independent of the current density in the range studied
   (50-100 mA cm(-2)). Moreover, when NaCl was present, the current
   efficiency for COD and phenol removal increase as the chloride
   concentration increases. Chloroform was the only halocompound detected
   at the end of reaction. For both electrodes, Bi-doped and pure lead
   dioxide, the chloroform concentration at the end of the electrolysis
   decreases, working at low current densities and for low chloride
   concentrations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most common problems encountered in water treatment
   applications of membranes is fouling. Natural organic matter (NOM)
   represents a particularly problematic foulant. Membranes may be fouled
   by relatively hydrophilic and/or hydrophobic NOM components, depending
   on NOM characteristics, membrane properties, kind operating conditions.
   To maximize flux recovery for an NOM-fouled ultrafiltration membrane
   (NTR 7410), chemical cleaning and hydraulic rinsing with a relatively
   high cross-flow velocity were investigated as cleaning strategies. The
   modification of the membrane surface with either an anionic or a
   cationic surfactant was also evaluated to minimize membrane fouling and
   to enhance NOM rejection. Foulants from a hydrophobic NOM source (Orange
   County ground water (OC-GW)) were cleaned more effectively in terms of
   permeate flux by acid and caustic cleanings than foulants from a
   relatively hydrophilic NOM source (Horsetooth surface water (HT-SW)). An
   anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)) was not effective as a
   cleaning agent for foulants from either hydrophobic or hydrophilic NOM
   sources. High ionic strength cleaning with 0.1 M NaCl was comparatively
   effective in providing flux recovery for NOM-fouled membranes compared
   to other chemical cleaning agents, Increased cross-flow velocity and
   longer cleaning time influenced the efficiency of caustic cleaning, but
   not high ionic strength cleaning. The membrane was successfully modified
   only with the cationic surfactant, however, enhanced NOM rejection was
   accompanied by a significant flux reduction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Cucurbituril was investigated regarding its potential as a sorbent for
   the removal of reactive dyes from model solutions and authentic
   wastewaters. The solubility of cucurbituril is low in pure water but
   increases in the presence of salts. When dyes sorbing onto cucurbituril
   are present, solubility is drastically decreased compared to dye-free
   media. Sorption efficiency depends on salt concentration and salt
   species. Moderate salt concentrations favor sorption, high
   concentrations lead to cucurbituril dissolution. Divalent, ions have a
   stronger effect than monovalent ions and larger ions more than smaller
   ones. In tests with authentic wastewaters cucurbituril was partially
   (20-100\%) dissolved and contaminant removal was inefficient. Because of
   its,solubility, cucurbituril is not feasible as a sorbent in wastewater
   treatment unless it could be covalently fixed onto a suitable support

Abstract = {{In Part I it was shown, that cucurbituril has high sorption capacities
   for the removal of reactive dyes from textile wastewater: despite the
   partial dissolution of this sorbent. Ozonation has been suggested as a
   regeneration step for loaded cucurbituril. Ozonation of loaded and pure
   cucurbituril was therefore evaluated. Dissolved cucurbituril reacts with
   ozone forming oxidation products like nitrite, nitrate, formate, acetate
   and oxalate. Oxidation is enhanced at alkaline pH. Dye-loaded
   cucurbituril suspended in water can be decolorized by ozone, but the
   ozone consumption is up to seven times higher than for ozonation of the
   dissolved dyes without cucurbituril. Loaded columns can be regenerated
   by ozone gas, but dissolution of cucurbituril results in a higher DOC
   content than the initial one to be removed. Therefore oxidative
   regeneration does not seem to be a feasible approach in this case. (C)

Abstract = {{Quantitative oligonucleotide probe hybridizations, immunostaining. and a
   simple foaming potential test were used to follow an incident of
   seasonal filamentous foaming at the Urbana-Champaign Sanitary District,
   Northeast Wastewater Treatment Plant. A positive correlation was
   observed between an increase in foaming potential and the appearance of
   foam on the surfaces of aeration basins and secondary clarifiers. In
   addition, during the occurrence of foaming, the mass and activity of
   Gordon ia spp. increased as measured by fluorescence in situ
   hybridization, antibody staining, and quantitative membrane
   hybridization of RNA extracts. An increase in Gordonia spp. rRNA levels
   from 0.25 to 1.4\% of total rRNA was observed using quantitative
   membrane hybridizations, whereas during the same period, the fraction of
   mixed liquor volatile suspended solids attributed to Gordonia spp.
   increased from 4\% to more than 32\% of the total mixed liquor volatile
   suspended solids, These results indicate that both the activity and
   biomass level of Gordonia spp. in activated sludge increased relative to
   the activity and the biomass level of the complete microbial community
   during a seasonal occurrence of filamentous foaming. Thus, Gordonia spp.
   may represent a numerically dominant but metabolically limited fraction
   of the total biomass, and the role of Gordonia spp. in filamentous
   foaming may be linked more tightly to the physical presence of
   filamentous microorganisms than to the metabolic activity of the cells.

Abstract = {{The effect of wet air oxidation on the aerobic biodegradability of a
   model wastewater containing 1000 mg L-1 of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate
   (LAS) has been investigated. Semibatch oxidation experiments were
   performed at a temperature of 473 K, an oxygen partial pressure of 1.3
   MPa and residence times varying from 40 to 390 min, while continuous
   oxidation experiments were performed at a residence time of 120 min.
   Oxygen uptake tests were performed to assess the aerobic
   biodegradability of both the oxidised and the original LAS solutions
   using cultures that had been adapted to both LAS and oxidation
   intermediates. The concentration of total organic carbon, chemical
   oxygen demand and active detergent were followed throughout the wet
   oxidation and biodegradation experiments, while the main intermediates
   formed during wet oxidation were identified by means of Electrospray-MS
   and high performance liquid chromatography. It was found that LAS could
   be easily oxidised at 473 K to yield a group of molecules with short
   alkyl chains which do not behave as active detergents. Sulfonated
   aromatics are produced as intermediates which have had the alkyl chain
   shortened. The segments of alkyl chains broken off the intermediate
   compounds appear primarily as short chain organic acids. The original,
   unoxidised 1000 mg L-1 LAS solution was found to be readily
   biodegradable in the laboratory aerobic reactors operating at low
   organic loadings and substrate to microorganism concentration ratios.
   However, wet oxidation resulted in effluents that were less readily
   biodegradable than the original LAS with biodegradability decreasing
   with increasing degree of oxidation. These results suggest that, at the
   conditions under consideration, a combined chemical pre-oxidation and
   biological post-treatment process may be less effective in removing LAS
   than a single-stage biological or chemical process. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Eight nitroarenes, 1,3-, 1,6- and 1,8-dinitropyrenes, 1-, 2- and
   4-nitropyrenes, 6-nitrochrysene and 2-nitrofluoranthene, in
   precipitation collected in Kanazawa were determined. The nitroarenes in
   the precipitation were concentrated onto solid phase extraction
   cartridges, and identified with highperformance liquid chromatography
   with chemiluminescence detection. The nitroarene concentrations in the
   precipitation were in the range 0.016-15 pmol/L, and the nitroarene
   composition tended to be the same as that in airborne particulates.
   I-Nitropyrene in river water and seawater were also determined.
   1-nitropyrene concentrations on the days after rain (19-110 fmol/L) were
   higher than those on the days before rain (4,11 fmol/L). Moreover,
   1-nitropyrene concentrations in the river water were much lower than
   those in the precipitation, but were higher than those in the seawater.
   These results suggested that the nitroarenes in the precipitation and
   the river water came from airborne particulates. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that the permeability and density of an aggregate
   decreases with its size, affecting its settling velocity and coagulation
   rate (rate of particle capture) with other particles. This change in
   aggregate density with size can be described by fractal scaling
   relationships. Two distinctly different fractal scaling approaches,
   however, have been used to describe aggregate permeability. In one
   approach (single-particle-fractal model), the permeability is calculated
   by assuming primary particles are uniformly distributed in the
   aggregate. In the other approach (cluster-fractal model), it is assumed
   that ag regales are composed of primary particles separated into
   individual clusters that are less permeable than the aggregate. The
   overall permeability of the aggregate is dependent on the number and
   sizes of these clusters. Using three different permeability correlations
   (Brinkman, Happel and Carmen-Kozeny), it is demonstrated through
   comparison with aggregate settling velocity data that the
   single-particle-fractal model does not provide realistic predictions of
   settling velocity as a function of aggregate size. In addition, it is
   shown that the Carmen-Kozeny permeability equation does not produce
   realistic settling velocity relationships. The transport settling
   velocity and capture rate of sinking aggregates in natural and
   engineered environments should therefore only be calculated using the
   Happel or Brinkman equations and a cluster-fractal model. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The Goshen Swamp, a fourth order blackwater creek in southeastern North
   Carolina, was clearcut of 130 acres of riparian and seasonally flooded
   forest in late May through September 1998. Downstream water quality had
   been monitored monthly for 21/2 years before the clearcut, during the
   clearcut, and for two years following the clearcut. The objective of
   this paper was to test the hypothesis that clearcutting in the Goshen
   Swamp watershed negatively impacted downstream water quality. To do so,
   data from the Goshen Swamp were compared with data collected from a
   neighboring control creek (Six Runs Creek) of similar size, land use,
   and hydrologic characteristics. Compared with the control creek, the
   post-clearcut Goshen Swamp displayed significantly higher suspended
   solids, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total Kjeldahl nitrogen and
   fecal coliform bacteria, and significantly lower dissolved oxygen over a
   15 month period, Longer-term deleterious effects included recurrent
   nuisance algal blooms that had not been present during the 21/2 years
   before the clearcut. Although a 10 m uncut buffer zone was left
   streamside, this was insufficient to prevent the above impacts to stream
   water quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It is hypothesised that the experimental sorption coefficient normalised
   to the organic carbon fraction of sediment (K(oc)(exp)) for non-ionic,
   hydrophobic, organic pollutant depends upon the molecular properties as
   well as background ionic strength of the aquatic system. The utility of
   this concept has been demonstrated by incorporating ionic strength as a
   parameter in the three quantitative structure activity relationships
   (QSARs) namely octanol-water partitioning coefficient model (Kew model),
   the linear solvation energy model (LSE model), and molecular
   connectivity indices theory (MCI model). Four chlorinated benzenes and
   two chlorinated phenols were employed in the present study. Sorption
   experiments using sediment from the Patalganga River were conducted in
   laboratory (bottle point method) at different ionic strengths (viz.
   0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 M). The K(oc)(cal) values predicted using Kew model
   incorporating ionic strength compare reasonably well with the K(oc)(exp)
   values (r(2) = 0.60 and standard error of estimator i.e. SEE = 0.35).
   The LSE model incorporating ionic strength too, was found to be equally
   good (r(2) = 0.67, SEE = 0.33). An attempt has also been made to
   validate the QSARs developed in the present study utilising the sorption
   parameters experimentally measured by Dewulf et al. (1996) (Water Res.
   30, 3130-3138) for sorption of toluene, ethylbenzones, and xylenes onto
   the sediments from Belgian Continental Shelf and North Sea, as well as
   Mader et al. (1997) (Environ. Sei. Technol, 27, 1524-1531) for sorption
   of di, tri-, tetra chlorobenzenes on pure mineral oxides namely
   Al(2)O(3) and Fe(2)O(3). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work extensions to principal component analysis (PCA) for
   wastewater treatment (WWT) process monitoring are discussed.
   Conventional PCA has some limitations when used for WWT monitoring.
   Firstly, PCA assumes that data are stationary, which is normally not the
   case in WWT monitoring. Secondly, PCA is most suitable for monitoring
   data that display events in one time-scale. However, in WWT operation,
   disturbances and events occur in different time-scales. These two
   limitations make conventional PCA unsuitable for WWT monitoring. The
   first limitation can be overcome by use of adaptive PCA. In adaptive
   PCA, the PCA model is continuously updated using an exponential memory
   function. Variable mean, variance and co-variance are thus adapted to
   the changing conditions. The second problem can be solved by time-scale
   decomposition of data prior to analysis. The time-scale decomposition
   methodology involves wavelets and multiresolution analysis (MRA) in
   combination with PCA. MRA provides a tool for investigation and
   monitoring of process measurement at different timescales by decomposing
   measurement data into separate frequency bands. Time-scale decomposition
   increases the sensitivity of the monitoring, which makes it possible to
   detect small but significant events in data displaying large variations.
   Moreover, time-scale information is sometimes important in the
   interpretation of a disturbance to determine its physical cause. Also,
   by decomposing data, the problem of changing process conditions is
   partly solved. All the presented methods are illustrated with examples
   using real WWT process data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Micro-electrodes were applied to anaerobic granular sludge, which was
   developed in a UASB reactor, to examine intra-granule profiles with
   respect to pH, glucose and sulfide. When glucose was employed as a bulk
   liquid substrate, the micro-electrodes study demonstrated the pH
   behavior along granule depth: pH decrement at the granule exterior
   portion due to acid formation (buildup of acidity), and subsequent pH
   increment at the granule inner portion due to the consumption of acid
   (buildup of alkalinity), Sulfide micro-electrode proved sulfate
   reduction that mostly occurred at the granule exterior portion. Chemical
   equilibrium consideration evidently explained the occurrence of ferric
   sulfide predominantly in the interior portion, which accounts well for
   the morphology of a representative double-layered structure of granules
   grown on a low level of sulfate, Inorganic elements distribution within
   anaerobic granule was examined by electron probe X-ray micro analysis
   (EPMA) and ICP methods. The presence of crystalline calcium carbonate
   (calcite) was identified by X-ray diffraction analysis. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{As a new kind of water and wastewater treatment reagents, inorganic
   polymer flocculants (IPFs) are in a trend of rapid development. Among
   them, iron-based IPF without any toxic problems is greatly expected. In
   this paper, a new protocol for preparation of iron-based IPF is
   investigated. Three kinds of silica, named silicaA, silicaB and silicaC,
   are prepared and used as modifiers to tailor-make polyferric silicate
   (PFSi), denoted PFSiA, PFSiB and PFSiC, respectively, in accordance to
   the above silica. Based on several direct and indirect speciation
   methods, the species distribution and characteristic of three kinds of
   PFSi are investigated in detail. The experiment results show that the
   species distribution of PFSi is mainly decided by the kinds of silica
   introduced and Si/Fe ratio adopted. SilicaA and silicaB function as
   precipitation preventing reagents during the hydrolysis of Fc(Ill). At
   certain amount of basicity, Fe. (monomers) increases with increase of
   Si/Fe ratio, while Fe, (colloidal species) decreases markedly. Although
   the formation of Fe, is inhibited, the stabilization Of Feb (oligomers
   or polymers) can still not be achieved. SilicaC on the other hand
   exhibits little effect on the species distribution of modified Fe(III)
   solutions. The coagulation behavior of above PFSi is also examined, The
   different effect of silica is then discussed with respect to the
   chemical species. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the scaling of aeration devices, and more
   specifically hydro-ejectors, in the case of heterogeneous aeration.
   Because the transfer of oxygen only occurs in a very small part of the
   volume of the treatment basin, the transfer performance of the aerator
   depends on the device itself and on the surrounding flow
   characteristics. First experiments were achieved with a 10 L
   mechanically agitated reactor in order to operate at a known k(L)a and
   liquid flowrate Q. The results show that the oxygen transfer capacity of
   the reactor is used to a greater or lesser extent depending on the
   flowrate which passes through the bubbling region. When a hydro-ejector
   is concerned, the oxygen transfer occurs-inside an aerated zone of about
   2 m(3): experiments carried out with an industrially scaled HE in a 120
   m(3) test basin allowed to estimate that the kLa in this zone is about
   700-800 h(-1). Applying a compartment model, it is then possible to
   determine the oxygen transfer capacity of the HE as a function of the
   transverse liquid flowrate. While this OC is 3 kg O-2/h under the test
   basin conditions, it reaches up to 12 kg O-2/h under industrial flow
   conditions. This value was obtained in the aerobic biological treatment
   of the washing waters of a sugar refinery where two 33,000 m(3) basins
   aerated by 152 HE could degrade 35 t/d of COD. (C) 2001 Elsevier.

Abstract = {{An evaluation of the application of electric furnace slag (EFS) as an
   adsorbent to remove Pb2+ and Cu-2 from industrial effluents is
   presented. The paper examines phase composition or EFS X-ray diffraction
   of powder. In the batch experiments, parameters studied include the
   effect of initial concentration of lead and copper ions, temperature,
   and contact time. Over the temperature range studied (293-313 K) the
   results of adsorption experiments could be Fitted by using both Langmuir
   and Freundlich models and thermodynamic values of DeltaG(0), DeltaH(0)
   and DeltaS(0) corresponding to each adsorption process were calculated.
   Satisfactory conformity between experimental data and the
   model-predicted values was expressed by the correlation coefficient
   (R-2). Both Langmuir and Freundlich models described the Pb2+ and Cu2+
   sorption processes adequately, with correlation coefficient (R-2) values
   ranging from 0.9760 to 0.9994. Data from this study indicated the
   potential use of the tested electric furnace slag, a by-product from

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to investigate the performance of the upflow
   anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor treating leachate from
   acidogenic fermenter in the two-phase anaerobic digestion of food waste.
   The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was consistently
   over 96\% up to the loading rates of 15.8 g COD/1d. The methane
   production rate increased to 5.51/1 d. Of all the COD removed, 92\% was
   converted to methane and the remaining presumably to biomass. At loading
   rates over 18.7 g COD/1d, the COD removal efficiency decreased due to
   sludge flotation and washout in the reactor, which resulted from short
   HRT of less than 10.6 h. The residual propionate concentration was the
   highest among the volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the effluent. The
   specific methanogenic activity (SMA) analysis showed that the
   VFA-degrading activity of granule was the highest for butyrate, and the
   lowest for propionate. Typical granules were found to be mainly composed
   of microcolonies of Methanosaeta. The size distribution of sludge
   particles indicated that partially granulated sludge could maintain the
   original structure of granular sludge and continue to gain size in the
   UASB reactor treating leachate from acidogenic fermenter. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The inhibition of light emitted by the bioluminescent bacterium, Vibrio
   fischeri, is the basis for several toxicity bioassays. The inhibitory
   effects of 81 chemicals, after 5 min contact time, were studied at eight
   concentrations using reagents from three commercial assay systems
   (ToxAlert 10 (R), Microtox (R) and LUMIStox (R)). Solubility in water
   was the limiting factor in determining the selection of chemicals for
   study. The effective nominal concentrations (EC) resulting in 20, 50 and
   80\% inhibition were determined using Ln dose/Ln gamma plots and the
   results obtained for each system were compared by linear regression. The
   chemical concentrations producing 10-90\% inhibition extended over 9
   orders of magnitude and ranged from a minimum of 0.001 ppm to a maximum
   of 1000,000 ppm. The toxicity of many chemicals was apparently related
   to their pH in solution and at high chemical concentrations, to osmotic
   imbalance. The fact that the same operator tested the same solutions
   simultaneously on three different systems reduced sources of error and
   variability and improved the consistency and reliability of the results.
   Only five compounds gave EC 50s that varied more than three-fold between
   assays, These data provide comparisons of toxicity that have not been
   previously available and demonstrate that, when used under standardised
   conditions, these bioluminescence-based toxicity assays produce very
   similar results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Reconquista river is a typical example of the adverse impact of
   human activity on a watercourse. Approximately 10\% of the population of
   the country is settled on its basin,and it receives wastewater
   discharges from residences and industries. This paper describes the
   results of the first systematic data for measurement of pesticides in
   surface water of the river, based on a monthly monitoring program over
   two-year span. The analyses were performed, in three sampling stations
   (S-1, S-2 and S-3), along 46 km of its course, following the AOAC
   methods. Screening included the following pesticides: (a)
   Organochlorines: alpha, beta and gamma HCH; heptachlor, heptachlor
   epoxide; aldrin; endrin; dieldrin; op' and pp' DDT; op' and pp' DDE;
   alpha and gamma chlordane and endosulphan II; (b) Organophosphates:
   ethyl and methyl parathion; chlorpyrifos and fenitrothion. From the 60
   samples analyzed, 35\% contained organochlorine pesticides in a
   concentration higher than the detection limit. Organophosphates were
   found in no case. Throughout the studied period, DDT and its metabolite
   DDE were only found in S-1 and gamma chlordane in S-3; heptachlor was
   present in 50\% of the samples Of S-2 and in 35\% Of S-3, while HCH
   isomers were detected in 38\% Of S-2 and 45\% of S-3 samples. Neither
   temporal nor spatial trends were found. There was not a relationship
   between the time of samplings and the fumigation season for farming
   purposes, At all locations, pesticides levels were found to be between
   40 and 400 times higher than the legal limits established for protection
   of aquatic life. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary databases, GIS and multivariate analysis tools were used to
   determine whether there was a correlation between water quality and
   landscape characteristics within three local southern Ontario
   watersheds. Whole catchment and 100 in buffer zone influences on water
   quality over three seasons were compared. Chemical fluxes were also
   calculated and used to compare the loading of pollutants to downstream
   environments. Urban land use had the greatest influence on water
   quality. The influence of agricultural land use was variable and did not
   agree with the results of other studies. The only natural landscape
   variables that appeared to have an influence on water quality were slope
   and silt-clay surficial geology deposit. There was a clear trend of
   increased chemical fluxes with increasing urban land use intensity
   within a watershed. Forested land use appeared important in mitigating
   water quality degradation. The catchment landscape characteristics
   appeared to have slightly greater influence on water quality than the
   100 m buffer. The results of this study may have been influenced by the
   scale and accuracy of databases used. The secondary data were useful in
   determining major trends in water quality and possible non-point origins
   of surface water pollution, and in identifying areas that are in need of
   further investigation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Denitrification walls are a useful approach for removing nitrate from
   shallow groundwater, but little is known about the sustainability of
   nitrate removal, which is dependent on the continued supply of organic
   carbon to denitrifying bacteria. To address this question, we monitored
   nitrate removal, denitrification and carbon dynamics in a pilot-scale
   denitrification wall for 5 yr. The wall continuously removed more than
   95\% of the incoming nitrate in groundwater, which ranged from 5 to 15
   mg N L-1. We did not detect decreases in total carbon during the 5-yr
   study. Available carbon declined for the first 200 days after the wall
   was constructed but has since remained relatively constant. While
   microbial biomass has varied between 350 and 550 mug C g(-1) there was
   no downward trend, suggesting that carbon availability was not limiting
   the size of the microbial population. However, there was a large
   decrease in denitrifying population, as indicated by declines in
   denitrifying enzyme activity. Despite this decrease, denitrification
   rates have remained high enough to remove nitrate from groundwater and
   denitrification was limited by nitrate rather than by carbon. Our data
   demonstrates that there was sufficient available carbon in this
   denitrification wall to support denitrification and nitrate removal for
   at least 5 yr. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, during a three-month exposure lethal and sublethal
   effects of ammonium and its products on typical brook organisms
   (Gammarus pulex, Amphipoda; Radix ovata, Gastropoda; Limnephilus
   lunatus, Trichoptera) were monitored in microcosms approximating field
   conditions. Every 24 h during this period the microcosms were
   contaminated with ammonium at five different nominal concentrations,
   which by chemical reactions produced a mixture of the toxic products
   ammonia and nitrite. G. pulex proved the most sensitive to the ammonia
   and nitrite contamination resulting from the ammonium load. In contrast,
   L. lunatus and R. ovata exhibited clearly effects only at concentrations
   10 times higher. It is appropriate to investigate ammonium pollution
   with its reaction products as a mixture, because in natural bodies of
   water receiving ammonium input (e.g., from sewage-treatment plants) the
   substances ammonium/ammonia and nitrite are likewise present
   simultaneously. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about how the growth of halogenated disinfection
   by-products (DBPs) in drinking water is affected by time spent in a
   distribution system. Experiments were performed to compare the rate of
   trihalomethane and haloacetic acid production in a simulated pipe
   environment to that observed for the same water held in glass bottles,
   Results showed that although the rate of chlorine consumption in the
   pipe was much greater than in the bottle, there was no decrease in the
   amount of haloacetic acids produced and that trihalomethane levels
   actually increased by an average of 15\%. Separate tests confirmed that
   this increase was due to a reservoir of organic precursor material
   associated with deposits on the pipe wall. This work suggests that the
   rate of DBP production in a distribution system will not necessarily be
   reduced by increased chlorine consumption due to non-DBP producing
   reactions with deposits on the pipe wall. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The dose response relationship between seven commonly used herbicides
   and four luminescence-based bacterial biosensors was characterised. As
   herbicide concentration increased the light emitted by the test organism
   declined in a concentration dependent manner. These dose responses were
   used to compare the predicted vs. observed response of a biosensor in
   the presence of multiple contaminants. For the majority of herbicide
   interactions, the relationship was not additive but primarily
   antagonistic and sometimes synergistic. These biosensors provide a
   sensitive test and are able to screen a large volume and wide range of
   samples with relative rapidity and case of interpretation. In this study
   biosensor technology has been successfully applied to interpret the
   interactive effects of herbicides in freshwater environments. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The aims of this project were to assess bacterial populations
   (abundance, biomass and viability) in the influents and effluents of
   four constructed wetlands, and to analyse the effect of such biological
   treatment on these bacterial characteristics. Using the BacLight probe
   it was possible to determine the total abundance, the proportion of
   intact vs. damaged cells, and the lengths, widths and biovolumes, of
   bacteria in each of the samples. The reduction in bacterial
   concentration was higher (67\%) in the wetland used for secondary
   treatment than in those used for tertiary treatment (15-39\%). The
   proportion of damaged cells was higher in the influent (i.e. settled
   sewage) of the wetland used for secondary treatment (78\%) than in the
   influents of those wetlands used for tertiary treatment (45-70\%). This
   suggested that the majority of bacteria in the settled sewage were dead
   or damaged, and that these were removed from the wastewaters more
   effectively than were undamaged cells during conventional secondary
   treatment (in this case, using rotating biological contactors or RBCs).
   In each wetland, the proportion of damaged cells was higher in the
   influent than in the effluent, suggesting that, as with RBCs, damaged
   bacteria were removed more effectively within the wetland than undamaged
   bacteria. The majority of bacteria leaving the constructed wetlands used
   for tertiary treatment, and 50\% of those leaving the secondary
   treatment wetland, were physically intact and therefore probably viable.
   Although there was a decrease in the abundance of total bacteria with
   treatment, bacterial biomass did not necessarily decrease with the
   treatment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Integrated modelling of eutrophication and organic contaminant fate \&
   effects in aquatic ecosystems. A review}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication and contamination with micropollutants have been major
   problems in water quality management. Both problems have been subjected
   to extensive research and modelling but traditionally are treated
   separately. Traditional simulation models for aquatic systems can be
   categorised as eutrophication models, contaminant fate models, food web
   models and food chain bioaccumulation models. Because they are single
   issue models, many interactions and feedbacks between the food web,
   nutrient and toxicant cycles are missed. Linking these models is
   essential to evaluate the fate and risks of contaminants in systems with
   changing nutrient loading, to assess the natural attenuation of
   contaminants or to understand the selfpurifying capacity of ecosystems.
   Combination of the single issue models requires inclusion of
   `interaction processes' to account for the coupling between the (sub-)
   model types, such as organic carbon cycling, toxicity, transport and
   accumulation of organic contaminants in the food chain, and bottom up
   versus top down control of primary production and nutrient cycling. This
   review first provides a brief overview of traditional approaches in
   modelling eutrophication, contaminant fate, food web dynamics and food
   chain bioaccumulation. Second, five existing integrated eutrophication,
   fate and/or effects models are reviewed. Third, the gaps and limitations
   in modelling the four types of interaction processes are discussed. It
   is concluded that these models are invaluable tools to focus attention
   to feedback mechanisms that are often overlooked, to identify dominating
   processes in ecosystems, to formulate counterintuitive hypotheses on
   ecosystem functioning, or to assess short term risks of acutely toxic
   stressors, However, the potential of integrated models for long term
   simulations of contaminant exposure, food chain bioaccumulation and
   effects to higher trophic levels remains limited, mainly because of
   principal limitations in food web modelling. In contrast, the potential
   of integrated models for long term simulations of contaminant fate is
   better because the environmental distribution of contaminants is mainly
   determined by the major abiotic compartments and by biotic compartments
   at the base of the food chain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Aliphatic and alicyclic amines as well as ethanolamines are extremely
   polar compounds, frequently found in the environment, and some of them
   have high toxicity. To address the contamination of selected German
   surface waters examined and the importance of bank filtration in Eastern
   Germany, investigations on the behaviour of polar organic nitrogen
   compounds during water treatment were carried out. Test conditions were
   designed appropriately for drinking water treatment conditions, and the
   tests were carried out using model water as well as bank filtrate. Test
   filter studies of microbial degradation of selected compounds
   demonstrated the following order of biodegradability:
   ethanolamine>dimethylamine>pyrrolidine>
   ethylenediamine/piperidine>diethylamine>morpholine>piperazine>cyclohexyl
   amine. Flocculation tests using iron salts as well as aluminium salts as
   coagulants showed very low removal rates for the amines. The best
   results for the removal of the polar organic nitrogen compounds from the
   water were obtained using ozonation. Based on the reaction-rate
   constants, the order of degradation by ozone is:
   piperazine>morpholine>ethylenediamine>piperidine,
   cyclohexylamine>dimethylamine >ethanolamine>pyrrolidine>diethylamine.
   Disinfection by chlorine-containing agents under drinking water
   treatment conditions did not give effective elimination of the selected
   polar nitrogen compounds. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The influence of heating or boiling on the formation and behavior of

   water, municipal tap water, and synthetic water containing chlorinated

   leads to both formation of smaller chlorinated molecules (including THMs
   and HAAs) and dechlorination of organics. In parallel with their
   formation from larger molecules, THMs can be volatilized, and this
   latter process dominates the change in their concentration when water is
   boiled. HAAs are not volatile, but they can be destroyed by chemical
   reactions at elevated temperatures, with the net effect being loss of
   trihalogenated HAAs and either formation or loss of less chlorinated
   HAAs. Although other identifiable DBPs can be generated at slightly
   elevated temperatures, in most cases their concentrations decline
   dramatically when the solution is heated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The ability of crab shell to remove heavy metals from aqueous solution
   was evaluated by comparing with that of several sorbents (cation
   exchange resin, zeolite, granular activated carbon, powdered activated
   carbon). All experiments were conducted using several heavy metal ion
   solutions (Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr). The orders of heavy metal removal capacity
   and initial heavy metal removal rate were found as crab shell>cation
   exchange resin>zeolite>powdered activated carbon greater than or equal
   to granular activated carbon. Therefore, crab shell is satisfactory as a
   good biosorbent for the heavy metal removal. The study indicates that
   the removal of these heavy metals is selective, with Pb and Cr being
   removed in preference to Cd and Cu. The sorption equilibrium of heavy
   metal ions on sorbents was modeled on the applications of Langmuir and
   Freundlich. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anionic charge carried by aquatic humic substances plays a major
   part in their interaction with metal ions and other cationic species.
   Removal of such substances by coagulation and flocculation can be, at
   least partly, determined by charge neutralisation. In this work, the
   charge densities of a commercial humic acid and an aquatic humic extract
   have been investigated by studying their interactions with a series of
   synthetic cationic polyelectrolytes. These covered a range of charge
   densities and molecular weights. The techniques used were colloid
   titration by spectrophotometry and streaming current detection, and
   flocculation determined by colour removal and by an optical monitoring
   method. For a given cationic polyelectrolyte, all four methods gave
   charge densities for humic substances which were in good agreement.
   However, systematic differences in the apparent humic charge density
   were found, depending on the charge density of the cationic
   polyelectrolyte used. With low charge density polyelectrolytes, the
   apparent anionic charge of the humic substances was found to be low.
   With higher polyelectrolyte charge densities, the apparent humic
   substance charge density increases and reaches a limiting value when the
   polyelectrolyte charge is greater than about 3 meq/g. This indicates a
   non-stoichiometric interaction between the anionic sites of the humic
   substances and the cationic charges of the low-charge polyelectrolytes.
   Optimum flocculation of humics occurred with less cationic charge in the
   case of low-charge polyelectrolytes than those with higher charge
   density. However, the degree of removal was considerably better in the
   latter case. In all cases, the molecular weight of the cationic
   polyelectrolytes (over a range from about 50,000 to 15 million) appeared
   to have no effect on the results. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Large quantities of diverse polar organic chemicals are routinely
   discharged from oil production platforms in so-called produced waters.
   The environmental fate of many of these is unknown since few methods
   exist for their characterisation. Preliminary investigations into the
   use of multistage electrospray ionisation ion trap mass spectrometry
   (ESI-MS') show its potential for the identification and quantification
   of compounds in specialty oilfield chemicals (corrosion inhibitors,
   scale inhibitors, biocides and demulsifiers) and produced waters.
   Multiple stage mass spectrometry (MS') with both positive and negative
   ion detection allows high specificity detection and characterisation of
   a wide range of polar and charged molecules. For example, linear
   alkylbenzenesulfonates (LAS), alkyldimethylbenzylammonium compounds,
   2-alkyl-1-ethylamine-2-imidazolines,
   2-alkyl-1-{[}N-ethylalkylamide]-2-imidazolines and a
   di{[}alkyldimethylammonium-ethyl]ether were all identified and
   characterised in commercial formulations and/or North Sea oilfield
   produced waters. The technique should allow the marine environmental
   effects and fates of some of these polar compounds to be studied. (C)

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas spp were isolated from an anaerobic-aerobic dyeing house
   wastewater treatment facility as the most active azo-dye degraders.
   Decolorization of azo dyes and non-azo dyes including anthraquinone,
   metal complex and indigo was compared with individual strains and a
   bacterial consortium consisting of the individual strain and municipal
   sludge (50:50 wt). The consortium showed a significant improvement on
   decolorization of two recalcitrant non-azo dyes, but little effect on
   the dyes that the individual strains could degrade to a great or
   moderate extent. Decolorization of Acid violet 7 (monoazo) by a
   Pseudomonas strain GM3 was studied in detail under various conditions.
   The optimum decolorization activity was observed in a narrow pH range
   (7-8), a narrow temperature range (35-40 degreesC), and at the presence
   of organic and ammonium nitrogen. Nitrate had a severe inhibitory effect
   on azo dye decolorization: 10 mg/L led to 50\% drop in decolorization
   activity and 1000 mg/L to complete activity depression. A kinetic model
   is established giving the dependence of decolorization rate on cell mass
   concentration (first-order) and dye concentration (half order). The rate
   increased with temperature from 10 to 35 degreesC, which can be
   predicted by Arrhenius equation with the activation energy of 16.87
   kcal/mol and the frequency factor of 1.49x10(11) (mgL)(1/2)/g DCM min.

Abstract = {{The performance of a multistage ozone/hydrogen peroxide (O-3/H2O2)
   process was evaluated with respect to total organic carbon (TOC) removal
   of waste waters, An aqueous humic acid solution (5.2 mg Cl-1 as TOC) and
   a sand filtered secondary sewerage effluent (5.6 mg Cl-1 as TOC) were
   used as model waste waters. Appropriate range of hydrogen peroxide
   (H2O2) dose at each stage depended upon the components of the tested
   solutions that changed as the process proceeded. Higher hydrogen
   peroxide dose was required at later stages in which low reactivity
   compounds with hydroxyl radical (HOcircle), low molecular fatty acids,
   were predominant. And, oxalic acid concentration related to H2O2 demand
   at later stages. This was assumed that the slow decomposition of oxalic
   acid was rate-determining step for TOC removal after its accumulation,
   Also, it is important to maintain dissolved ozone at low concentration
   for efficient TOC removal because rapid ozone consumption is required
   for the rapid formation of hydroxyl radical (HOcircle). (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Bio logical phosphorus removal in activated sludge systems is thought to
   be a result of the action of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAO).
   However, not all phosphorus removed can be accounted for by PAO. A
   method for the qualitative in sim characterization of PAO cell clusters
   and closely associated extracellular exopolymers (EPS) is described.
   X-ray microanalysis was performed on samples from two activated sludge
   plants situated in Pretoria, South Africa. Analysis was done by means of
   scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive
   spectrometry (EDS). Cell clusters with associated EPS, on average,
   contained between 57\% and 59\% phosphorus, while EPS alone contained,
   on average, between 27\% and 30\% phosphorus. Results suggest that
   phosphorus removal in activated sludge might be due not only to PAO, but
   also by EPS acting as a phosphorus reservoir. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A method for the determination of ethylene glycol (EG), di(ethylene
   glycol) (E2) and tri(ethylene glycol) (E3) in environmental samples (raw
   and treated sewage, river water) has been developed. These substances
   are important by-products in the biotransformation of non-ionic
   surfactants (NS). The method is based on sequential liquid-liquid
   extraction with ethyl acetate and chloroform (resulting in the
   separation of poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG) and EG from the water
   matrix), precipitation of long-chained PEG (PEGlch) with Dragendorff
   reagent, extraction of short-chained PEG (PEGsh) (EG, E2 and E3) from a
   filtrate with chloroform and the final determination using alternating
   current voltammetry. The precision of the method is 7.3\%, the recovery
   95\% and a detection limit of 1.5 mug in the sample, i.e. 10 mug l(-1)
   was achieved, As evidenced by F and t tests, the developed method is
   equivalent to the indirect PEGsh determination by the difference
   approach where concentration of PEGsh is determined by the difference of
   the total PEG and PEGlch.
   The PEGsh fraction was found to be present in considerable
   concentrations in raw and treated sewage, river water, as well as being
   a major bio trans formation by-product in the continuous flow activated
   sludge testing of fatty alcohol ethoxylates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The green sulphur bacterium Chlorobium thiosulfatophilum was used to
   remove hydrogen sulphide from synthetic industrial wastewater and
   convert it to elemental sulphur in a fixed-film continuous-flow
   photosynthetic bioreactor. Twenty 150 min x 3 mm ID Tygon tubes formed
   the active part of the reactor resulting in a total volume of 21.2 mL.
   Seven steady states were achieved under different experimental
   conditions using this tubular photo-reactor. Sulphide loading rates
   ranged from I I I to 328 mg/h L under influent flowrates of 9.0-42.4
   mL/h and hydraulic retention times of 0.50 2.35h. The irradiance at the
   reactor surface averaged 25.4 W/m(2), The sulphide removal rates were
   found to be 82-100\% and elemental sulphur recovery rates were found to
   be 75-95\%. The maximum sustainable sulphide loading rate was found to
   be 286 mg/h L, which is 2.5 times higher than the previous reported
   highest value. Sulphide loading rate was found to be the function of
   radiant flux per unit reactor volume and the bacteriochlorophyll

Abstract = {{Ground-water sampling techniques were modified to reduce random
   low-level contamination during collection of filtered water samples for
   determination of trace-element concentrations. The modified sampling
   techniques were first used in New Jersey by the US Geological Survey in
   1994 along with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
   analysis to determine the concentrations of 18 trace elements at the one
   microgram-per-liter (mug/L) level in the oxic water of the unconfined
   sand and gravel Kirkwood-Cohansey aquifer system, The revised technique
   tested included a combination of the following: collection of samples
   (1) with flow rates of about 2 L per minute, (2) through acid-washed
   single-use disposable tubing and (3) a single-use disposable 0.45-mum
   pore size capsule filter, (4) contained within portable glove boxes, (5)
   in a dedicated clean sampling van, (6) only after turbidity stabilized
   at values less than 2 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), when
   possible. Quality-assurance data, obtained from equipment blanks and
   split samples, indicated that trace element concentrations, with the
   exception of iron, chromium, aluminum, and zinc, measured in the samples
   collected in 1994 were not subject to random contamination at 1 mug/L.
   Results from samples collected in 1994 were compared to those from
   samples collected in 1991 from the same 12 PVC-cased observation wells
   using the available sampling and analytical techniques at that time.
   Concentrations of copper, lead, manganese and zinc were statistically
   significantly lower in samples collected in 1994 than in 1991. Sampling
   techniques used in 1994 likely provided trace-element data that
   represented concentrations in the aquifer with less bias than data from
   1991 when samples were collected without the same degree of attention to
   sample handling. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A paradoxical situation was found in the sand filters of a cold marine
   mesocosm: meiofaunal masses which were large enough to inhibit the
   mineralization and nitrification processes coexisted with nitrogen
   cycling bacteria, To test whether the copepod-dominated meiofauna were
   resident and actively feeding or transient and carried passively through
   the sand filters, residence times (RTs) were measured for various
   meiofaunal groups in a newly started filter and in a long established
   one. Most meiofauna colonized the newly started filter in less than 6 h,
   but their RTs were less than 24 It. In contrast, RTs were 147 d for
   halacarids, 291 d for harpacticoid copepods and 1228 d for nematodes in
   the long established filter. Mesocosm periphyton, which occupied a large
   fraction of the mesocosm surface area and was characterized by high
   meiofaunal densities, was probably the main source of meiofauna in the
   sand filters. Pool sediments, consisting of gravel or sand, were second
   to periphyton and contributed hydrozoans and mesopsammic species to the
   filters. The small copepod Pseudonychocamptus proximus progressively
   replaced the large Tisbe furcata in sand filters during the fall of 1995
   and was responsible for the large increase in meiofaunal biomass
   observed after spring 1996. This replacement was presumably facilitated
   by the copepod size selection process operated by the filters. Large
   copepods were retained by the surface layer of sand or brought up by the
   backwash water and then exit the mesocosm through the drain. High
   meiofaunal populations did not significantly affect nitrogen cycling
   bacteria in sand filters probably because meiofauna also fed on other
   abundant food sources which were carried in by the water flow. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The Bangpakong River is the most important watershed in the Eastern part
   of Thailand. Water quality parameters were sampled from June 1998
   through May 1999 at 11 sites along a 227 km gradient, covering the wet
   season (June November) and the dry season (December-May). Surface water
   was collected at three different stations per site (close to the banks
   and in the middle of the river), and analyzed for temperature, dissolved
   oxygen, turbidity, suspended solids, pH, ammonia, fecal coliforms,
   biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand as well as
   conductivity, phosphate, and heavy metals. The Scottish water quality
   index (WQI) was adaptated to the tropical environment. The averaged WQI
   was low (41\%) and quality declined significantly during the dry season
   (ANOVA, p<0.001). Although the quality rose somewhat at middle sites,
   only 27\% of the WQI values during wet season and 2.5\% during dry
   season were higher than 50\%, denoting poor environmental quality.
   Within each season, the main sources of variability were the differences
   between sites along the gradient (48\% during the wet season, 63\%
   during the dry season), whereas monthly variability represented less
   than 20\% of the variability. The seasonal results show that the river
   is suitable only for tolerant fish and wildlife species and is of
   doubtful use for potable water supply during the dry season. As quality
   improves during the wet period, water can be used for the production of
   potable water, but only with advanced treatment, and for indirect and
   noncontact recreational activities. In the middle stretches of the
   river, higher water quality permits multiple uses at moderate cost. (C)

Abstract = {{Rapid oxidation and accretion of iron onto high surface area media has
   been investigated as a potential passive treatment option for
   ferruginous, net-alkaline minewaters. Two pilot-scale reactors were
   installed at a site in County Durham, UK. Each 2.0 m high cylinder
   contained different high surface area plastic trickling filter media.
   Ferruginous minewater was fed downwards over the media at various
   flow-rates with the objective of establishing the efficiency of iron
   removal at different loading rates. Residence time of water within the
   reactors was between 70 and 360 s depending on the flow-rate (1 and
   121/min, respectively), Average influent total iron concentration for
   the duration of these experiments was 1.43 mg/l (range 1.08 1.84 mg/l;
   n=16), whilst effluent iron concentrations averaged 0.41 mg/l (range
   0.20-1.04 mg/l; n=15) for Reactor A and 0.38 mg/l (range 0.11-0.93 mg/l;
   n=16) for Reactor B. There is a strong correlation between influent iron
   load and iron removal rate. Even at the highest loading rates
   (approximately 31.6 g/day) 43\% and 49\% of the total iron load was
   removed in Reactors A and B, respectively. At low manganese loading
   rates (approximately 0.50-0.90 g/day) over 50\% of the manganese was
   removed in Reactor B. Iron removal rate (g/m(3)/d) increases linearly
   with loading rate (g/day) up to 14g/d and the slope of the line
   indicates that a mean of 85\% of the iron is removed. In conclusion, it
   appears that the oxidation and accretion of ochre on high surface area
   media may be a promising alternative passive technology to constructed
   wetlands at certain sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{2,4,6-Trimercaptotriazine, trisodium salt nonahydrate (TMT-55) is a
   commercial product that is widely used to chemically precipitate
   cadmium, lead, zinc and other heavy metals from wastewaters and
   contaminated natural waters, When mixed with aqueous solutions of
   TMT-55, aqueous solutions of either reagent-grade zinc, cadmium, or lead
   salts precipitate crystalline ``Zn-TMT{''}, amorphous or crystalline
   ``Cd-TMT{''} or amorphous ``Pb TMT{''} (M-3{[}S3C3N3](2).nH(2)O, where
   M=Cd2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ and n greater than or equal to0) that may
   eventually crystallize if stored in air. Laboratory aqueous leaching
   studies over 78-106 days using pH 3 HCl, distilled water (pH 6)and pH
   9-10 NaOH evaluated the stability of the Cd-, Pb-, and Zn TMT
   precipitates. Under pH 3 conditions, the amorphous Cd- and Pb-TMT
   compounds converted to their crystalline forms and amorphous Cd-TMT also
   crystallized in distilled water, Otherwise, no decomposition products
   were detected in the leached solid residues. When compared with the
   aqueous solubilities of corresponding sulfides and most hydroxides, the
   TMT compounds were significantly more soluble in distilled water and pH
   3 HCl. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Photooxidation (UV radiation) and enhanced photooxidation. (UVC/H2O2)
   are water treatment technologies which remove aquatic natural organic
   matter (NOM) by photodegradation, producing lower molecular weight
   components and CO2. Since these technologies are being investigated for
   the treatment of drinking water, knowledge of the potential toxicity of
   the photooxidation by-products is vital. The potential toxicity of UVA-,
   UVB-, UVC-irradiated, and UVC/H2O2-treated aquatic NOM in two spot
   samples from two Australian reservoirs was analysed in two spot samples
   using Vibrio fischceri in the Microtox(TM) test, African green monkey
   kidney cells (AS/NZS 4020:1999), and Daphnia Carinata in an acute
   immobilisation test. Toxicity was not apparent for both the Microtox(TM)
   procedure and cytotoxicity analyses for the UVC-irradiated and
   UVC/H2O2-treated NOM samples, while UVA- and UVB-irradiated water
   samples were non-toxic to D. carinata. In contrast, acute toxicity was
   observed for UVC- and UVC/H2O2-treated water samples. The observed
   toxicity was attributed to photooxidative degradation of NOM-metal
   binding sites, which resulted in the release of bioavailable copper
   ions, as evidenced by higher concentrations of free copper ions in
   photooxidised water. As the total copper concentrations of the two raw
   water samples were well below the Australian Water Quality Guidelines
   for metals in domestic supplies, the release of copper from
   photooxidised NOM is unlikely to cause health concerns in these samples.

Abstract = {{There have been several reports on storage protocols for the
   determination of nutrients in natural waters but each one has been
   Limited to a particular sample matrix and they have reached different,
   matrix specific conclusions. The aim of this study was therefore to
   systematically apply the various recommended storage protocols to a
   range of natural water matrices. Samples from four contrasting sites in
   the UK, collected in late winter (February, 1999), were filtered and
   stored under different conditions (-80 degreesC, -20 degreesC, 4
   degreesC and at 4 degreesC and -20 degreesC with 0.1\% (v/v) chloroform)
   for up to 247 days prior to analysis. The sites were the River Frome in
   Dorset (a chalk stream catchment) and three sites from the Tamar Estuary
   (draining a non-chalk catchment) with salinities of 0.5 parts per
   thousand, 10 parts per thousand and 34 parts per thousand. Samples and
   controls were analysed for total oxidised nitrogen (TON) and filterable
   reactive phosphorus (FRP) using a segmented flow analyser with
   spectrophotometric detection, To investigate possible seasonal effects
   (particularly changes in biological and chemical matrix composition), a
   second sampling campaign was undertaken in early autumn (October, 1999).
   The results showed that the optimum storage conditions for the
   determination of TON and FRP were highly matrix dependent, with
   significant differences in FRP stability between the Frome and Tamar
   catchments (due to different calcium concentrations) and between samples
   of different salinities (due to different bacterial populations and/or
   dissolved organic matter). General guidelines for sample handling and
   storage are listed and matrix specific recommendations presented for
   samples rich in calcium and dissolved organic matter. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), were
   investigated in urban effluents to wastewater treatment plants in the
   Paris area (France), under different meteorological conditions. The
   Acheres plant was considered with special attention because of its
   particular features. Wastewater PAH concentration level was 6 fold
   higher than that of PCBs. In March, PCB concentrations did not vary
   whatever the meteorological conditions whereas, for PAHs, they were
   markedly higher during rainy episodes. In September, concentrations of
   both pollutants increased due to rainy weather. The rise was 30 fold
   stronger for PAHs. Daily fluxes displayed the same trends. This suggests
   that the contribution of atmospheric wet deposition to wastewater
   contamination prevails for PCBs. In contrast, PAHs appeared to originate
   mainly from urban runoff processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Photochemical release of free amino acids was observed from dissolved
   fulvic acid (Suwannee River) and from colloidal fractions collected from
   Bayou Trepagnier, LA. Water samples were irradiated with a solar
   simulator, and free amino acid concentrations were determined using high
   performance liquid chromatography of the fluorescent derivitized amino
   acids. Increased concentrations of at least 20 amines were observed upon
   irradiation of water samples. Among the amino acids identified were
   alanine, asparagine, citrulline, glutamic acid, histidine, norvaline,
   and serine. Amino acid concentrations increased in the range of 0.03-9.5
   nM h(-1). Studies on the mechanism of photochemical release of ammonia
   from dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) indicated at least two
   mechanisms. One mechanism proceeds through an hydroxyl radical
   intermediate. This mechanism continues in the dark after irradiation
   through decomposition of photochemically produced H2O2 to form hydroxyl
   radical. Although NOM photosensitized degradation of amino acids
   produces ammonia, amino acids do not appear to be an important
   intermediate in the photochemical formation of ammonia from NOM. (C)

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Batch and continuous experiments were conducted to study the influence
   of dairy wastewater strength (2-30 g-COD/L) on acidification at pH 5.5
   and 37 degreesC. Results of batch experiments showed that carbohydrate
   was preferentially acidified as compared to protein and lipid.
   Production of VFAs (mainly acetate, propionate and butyrate) and
   hydrogen corresponded to carbohydrate acidification, whereas production
   of alcohols (mainly ethanol, propanol and butanol), plus i-butyrate and
   higher molecular-weight VFAs, corresponded to protein acidification. In
   treating high-strength wastewaters (8-30 g-COD/L), acetate, butyrate and
   PH, decreased after reaching their peak levels before leveling off.
   Results of continuous experiments with 12 h of hydraulic retention
   showed that acidification decreased with the increase of wastewater COD,
   from 57.1\% at 2 g-COD/L to 28.8\% at 30 g-COD/L; among the constituents
   in dairy wastewater, 92-99\% of carbohydrates, 59-85\% of protein and
   12-42\% of lipid were acidified. High-strength wastewater favored
   production of hydrogen and alcohols, especially propanol and butanol.
   The biomass yield was 0.258 g-VSS/g-COD. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   Sci. Technol. 16 (1982) 676; Glaze and Kang, Ind. Eng, Chem. Res. 26
   (1989) 1573) indicates that the oxidation of MTBE is primarily induced
   by the hydroxyl radical. The degradation of MTBE can be described by a
   pseudo-first-order kinetics in two phases. The first-phase covers MTBE
   concentrations greater than 10 mg L-1 and the second-phase covers MTBE
   concentrations below 10 mg L-1. The rate of oxidation of MTBE (at least
   in the first-phase) is limited by ozone mass transfer and increases with
   increasing ozone gas flow rate. The pseudo-first-order reaction rate
   constant varies from 2.0 x 10(-3) to 5.4 x 10(-3) s(-1) over the range
   of ozone gas flow rate employed in this investigation. An efficiency
   index is defined and its value for the oxidation of MTBE in different
   water is provided. The data provided show that remediation of
   MTBE-contaminated groundwater by O-3/H2O2 process is more efficient and
   less costly than by the UV/H2O2 process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Immobilised microorganisms provide a potential system for the treatment
   of metal-contaminated waters. This study investigates the efficiency of
   a rotating biological contactor (RBC) in the treatment of waters
   contaminated with cadmium, copper and zinc in multiple sorption
   desorption cycles. Each sorption cycle extended over a period of 12
   weeks at an HRT of 24 h to determine the efficiency of the system over a
   protracted period of time. The removal pattern observed in the initial
   cycle, namely Cu >> Zn > Cd, was repeated in both subsequent cycles.
   After completion of each cycle metals were successfully desorbed by
   means of an acid wash. The sorption ability of the biofilm was not
   adversely affected by the desorption process as evidenced by the similar
   metal removal rates obtained in each of the three sorption cycles. These
   results suggest that RBCs can be used successfully in the treatment of
   high-strength metal-contaminated wastewaters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

   adsorbing lead ions from solution at pH 4. The high performance
   exhibited by Mn-diatomite was attributed to increased surface area and
   higher negative surface charge after modification. Scanning electron
   microscope pictures revealed a birnessite structure of manganese oxides,
   which was featured by a plate-like-crystal structure. Diatomite,

Abstract = {{The abiotic transformation of catechol and I-naphthol singly and in
   mixtures was tested in sterile Tris-HCl buffer with regard to several
   environmental factors including temperature (7 degreesC, 20 degreesC and
   30 degreesC), lighting conditions, pH (between 7.0 and 9.5) and
   dissolved oxygen (at partial pressures of 0.0, 220, 2200, 11000 and
   22000 Pa).
   Irrespective of lighting conditions, catechol autoxidation was confirmed
   in aerated medium with a rate independent of the presence of 1-naphthol
   but proportional to the dissolved oxygen concentration, to the pH (its
   half-disappearance occurred in 24 h at pH 8.5) and, to a lesser extent,
   to the incubating temperature (at 20 degreesC, 20\% disappeared in 10
   days at pH 7.0). Under alkaline conditions, the reaction of the anionic
   form (catecholate) with an equimolar concentration of molecular oxygen
   (O-2) led presumably to hydrogen peroxide anion (HO2-) and coloured
   polymerization products.
   When tested alone, 1-naphthol was not significantly influenced either by
   lighting conditions, incubating temperature or dissolved oxygen
   concentration. It was also found to be quite stable with respect to pH,
   with a 15-fold weaker transformation rate than for catechol at the
   highest pH used.
   When tested in a mixture with catechol, 1-naphthol was found to be
   involved in a new chemical oxidation reaction catalyzed by catecholate.
   The transformation of one mole of 1-naphthol consumes four moles of
   oxygen. In the presence of catechol, the stoichiometry of the I-naphthol
   transformation, under the influence of oxygen, suggests the possible
   formation of 2,5,6,8-tetrahydroxy 1,4-naphthoquinone via Lawsone
   (2-hydroxy 1,4-naphthoquinone) and naphthopurpurine (2,5,8-trihydroxy
   1,4-naphthoquinone) as hypothetic intermediates. This is the first
   report of the autoxidation of 1-naphthol, catalyzed by catechol, in
   aqueous solution, in the absence of UV irradiation. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A fundamental study was conducted to assess removal and filtration
   capacity of waste and natural indigenous materials as treatment mediums
   e.g., shell, limestone, waste paper mixed with refuse concrete, refuse
   cement, also processed nitrolite, charcoal-bio and charcoal. Under room
   temperature condition removal of phosphoric, nitric a-nd ammonium-ions,
   filtration of suspended substance (SS) together with removal of COD in
   waste water was investigated. Influence of particle size effect for all
   treatment mediums except for waste paper was pursued. Significant
   improvement of waste water quality with respect to SS, phosphoric ions
   and decrease in COD is possible by treating with these filtration
   mediums. With specific reference to some treatment mediums NO3-N and
   NH4-N showed reasonable improvement in quality, although generally
   removal effect was not very significant. Efficacy of treatment was
   dependent on the particle size of treatment mediums in general, however,
   nitrolite for NH4-N, charcoal-A for SS and COD, refuse cement mixed with
   waste paper for PO4 ion removal showed insignificant variability on the
   particle size effect. Results of this fundamental study demonstrate
   effectiveness and feasibility for applied application of these proposed
   waste and naturally available treatment ingredients at lower cost. (C)

Abstract = {{Multixenobiotic defense mechanism (MXDM) has been recently described in
   marine mussels as potential biomarker for the monitoring of water
   pollution by organic compounds. In this paper, the measurement of MXDM
   activity was achieved in a freshwater bivalve, Dreissena polymorpha. Two
   methods were tested and compared. The first one (MXDM associated ATPase
   activity) is an indirect method based on the evaluation of the inorganic
   phosphate production during MXDM activity. The second one (MXDM efflux
   activity) consists in the measurement of a dye (Rhodamine B) efflux from
   gill cells in living organisms. Both methods were optimized and
   evaluated for in situ studies. The results showed a significant
   induction (4.5 fold) of the MXDM efflux activity after the implantation
   of organisms for 21 days in a high polluted site. This preliminary study
   suggests a potential use of the MXDM efflux activity in Dreissena
   polymorpha as a biomarker for the monitoring of freshwater pollution by
   organic compounds. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out to evaluate the prevalence of bacteria of the
   Legionella genus in the water from the pools and showers of 12 swimming
   pools in the city of Bologna (Italy), Sampling took place four times for
   every establishment, once for each season of the year. Legionella spp.
   were found in 2 of the 48 pool water samples (L. micdadei and L.
   bozemanii) and in 27 of the 48 samples taken from the hot water of the
   showers: 19 were positive for L. pneumophila (10-19,250cfu/l) and 18 for
   other species (20-6000 cfu/l). The contamination was seen to be
   consistent throughout the year, since the same species of legionellae
   were isolated at different samplings and in concentrations that did not
   reveal any seasonal trend. The legionellae and the Gram negative
   bacteria were not found in shower water with a temperature above 43
   degreesC. However, in the samples of shower water with a lower
   temperature a statistically significant inverse correlation was seen
   between legionellae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (r = -0.51; p < 0.01) as
   well as between legionellae and Gram negative bacteria (r = -0.70;
   p<0.01). The potential risk of contracting infections from Legionella
   spp. in the swimming pool environment does not seem to be linked to the
   pool water, but to that of the showers. The water temperature of showers
   should therefore be maintained at a level high enough to prevent the
   reproduction of these bacteria. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Toxic effects of 40\% (v/v) and 60\% (v/v) concentrations of wastewater
   from the industrial sector of chemical production on eggs of the
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) were investigated. Significant poisonous effects
   could be registered in test solutions containing 40\% wastewater for
   eggs up to 0.5 h of age. Solutions containing 60\% wastewater affected
   the mortality of the exposed eggs up to 1 h of age. Earlier stages were
   more sensitive to industrial wastewater than later stages. The
   differences in susceptibility must be ascribed to the ontogenetic stage
   of the eggs at which the experiment was started and to differences in
   the chorion permeability. The chorion is less permeable after hardening
   and works as a barrier to detrimental wastewater contents. This
   circumstance explains the higher viability of zebrafish eggs at the age
   of > 1 h. When using early stages of the zebrafish for ecological risk
   estimations, the eggs should, at best, not exceed the age of 0.5 h. (C)

Abstract = {{Aerobic spore-bearing bacilli have been proposed as a surrogate
   indicator for the removal of Cryptosporidium by drinking water treatment
   processes. Pasteurisation of samples followed by culture on
   non-selective media is the method of choice. Using white membranes for
   filtration of water samples makes colony counting difficult. Vital dyes
   such as neutral red or trypan blue can help when added to the growth
   medium but these dyes tend to colour the membrane and reduce the
   contrast between the colonies and the background. The incorporation of
   bromothymol blue at a concentration of 0.005\% (w/v) into nutrient agar
   facilitated colony counting without inhibiting colony formation compared
   with unsupplemented nutrient agar. Statistical analysis of the data
   (ANOVA) confirms this observation. The modified technique was found to
   be satisfactory with spore suspensions of Bacillus globigii and B.
   cereus as well as with samples of surface water, settled water and
   drinking water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A series of unsteady-state reaeration tests were performed in a 500-L
   tank at 0.8 1-4.58 m(3)/h diffused-air flow rate and 288-302K water
   temperature. Three different types of impurities: soybean oil,
   surfactant, and diatomaceous earth were doped to simulate the impurities
   in wastewaters and the effects of the impurities on the oxygen transfer
   rate were investigated. The ASCE and the two-zone oxygen mass-transfer
   models were used to analyze the unsteady-state reaeration data and the
   volumetric mass-transfer coefficients determined from the unsteady-state
   reaeration data were correlated as a function of the diffused-air flow
   rate, water temperature, and impurity concentration. The results showed
   that the alpha factors based on the ASCE model are less sensitive to the
   impurity concentration while the presence of the impurities
   significantly reduces the alpha factors in the gas bubble zone. The
   saturation DO concentration and volumetric oxygen mass-transfer rate can
   be predicted by the two-zone model along with the correlation obtained
   in this study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A colorimetric phosphatase inhibition assay using protein phosphatase 2A

   substrates. It has similar sensitivity to the radiolabelled assays and,
   with a working range of around 0.2-1 mug/L, is able to determine these
   toxins at concentrations below the provisional World Health Organisation
   guideline of 1 mug/L for microcystin-LR. The method appears robust and
   not to be affected by the sample matrix apart from possibly some
   components of cellular material if present at very high levels in
   extracts of cyanobacterial material. It is not affected by the presence
   of low levels of methanol in sample extracts. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A simple analytical system has been developed and tested for estimating
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations in nanoliter samples of

   introduces 200 nL of sample directly into the capillary tubing connected
   to a scanning UV-VIS detector equipped with a 35-nanoliter capillary
   flowcell. Analysis of DOC by spectroscopic and high-temperature
   catalytic oxidation (HTCO) methods on the same samples showed a strong
   linear correlation between UV absorbance at 254 nm and HTCO-DOC
   concentration, allowing the DOC quantification. The simplicity and the
   robustness of the UV system allow DOC measurements in the field at a
   rate of 30samples/h. We have used the UV system successfully for
   determining high-resolution distributions of porewater DOC
   concentrations in sediments at millimeter scales. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{he long-term behaviour of plasticised PVC products was investigated in
   laboratory-scale landfill simulation reactors. The examined products
   included a cable material and a flooring with different combinations of
   plasticisers. The objective of the study was to assess whether a
   degradation of the PVC polymer or a loss of plasticisers occurred under
   landfill conditions. A degradation of the polymer matrix was not
   observed. The contents of plasticisers in a.-ed samples was determined
   and compared to the respective original products. The behaviour of the
   various plasticisers was found to differ significantly. Losses of DEHP
   and BBP from the flooring were too low for analytical quantification. No
   loss of DIDP from the cable was detectable, whereas DINA in the same
   product showed considerable losses of up to 70\% compared to the
   original contents. These deficits were attributable to biodegradation
   rather than leaching. There was no equivalent release of plasticisers
   into the leachate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Perchlorate (ClO4-) has been detected in a large number of surface and
   ground waters in the US. Due to health concerns of perchlorate in
   drinking water, the California Department of Health Services has
   established a provisional action level of 18 mug/L. Several microbial
   isolates have been obtained capable of microbiological perchlorate
   reduction through cell respiration, but few of these have been tested
   for perchlorate removals to these low levels. The feasibility of using
   one isolate (KJ) for water treatment was tested in a packed-bed
   bioreactor by comparing minimum detention times necessary to achieve
   complete removal of perchlorate. Perchlorate was reduced approximately
   from 20 mg/L to non-detectable (<4 <mu>g/L) levels in acetate-fed
   columns inoculated with KJ or mixed cultures. The complete conversion of
   perchlorate to chloride was demonstrated by a stoichiometric, ratio of
   perchlorate to chloride of 1.0 +/-0.14. Perchlorate removal to
   non-detectable levels required a minimum empty bed contact time (EBCT)
   of only 2.1 min for the column inoculated with KJ, vs. 31 min for the
   mixed culture column. Acetate was used at a molar ratio Of C2H3O2-/ClO4-
   of 2.9 (n = 6) for the mixed culture, while more than twice as much
   acetate was consumed on average (6.6 +/-2.0, n = 156) by the pure
   culture. These results demonstrate that detention times of packed-bed
   bioreactors can be substantially reduced using isolate KJ, but that
   larger concentrations of acetate will be necessary to reduce perchlorate
   to low levels necessary for drinking water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Trichloroethene (TCE) transformation and the product distribution in an
   aqueous medium containing zero-valent iron (Fe(0)) was investigated in
   the presence of an anaerobic mixed culture to assess the potential role
   of microorganisms in permeable iron barriers. The presence of the
   culture increased the rate of TCE disappearance and changed the product
   distribution. Rapid formation and degradation of cis-dichloroethene
   (cis-DCE) was observed in reactors containing cells plus Fe(0) or H-2 as
   a bulk reducing agent. High levels of vinyl chloride (VC) were formed
   and very similar profiles were obtained in the Fc(0) plus cell and H2
   plus cell reactors, but not in Fe(0)-only reactors. The similar trends
   observed in Fe(0)-cell and H-cell reactors suggest that most cis-DCE and
   VC in the Fe(0)-cell reactors were produced and transformed biologically
   rather than abiotically. Accumulation of methane in the Fe(0)-cell
   system indicates that hydrogen gas generated during anaerobic iron
   corrosion could support a methanogenic culture. Digital confocal images
   showed that the microorganisms were able to colonize the iron surface.
   The results suggest that potential development of dechlorinating
   populations in Fe(0) barriers may alter the TCE reduction pathway and
   produce VC, which would have significant impact on the performance of
   Fe(0) barriers. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{.Attempts were made for removing ammonia from synthetic wastewater under
   the presence of phenol, which is inhibitory to nitrification, by using a
   single-stage activated sludge process with cross-flow filtration.
   Activated sludge biomass which had been acclimated with phenol for over
   15 years was used for the inoculum, and synthetic wastewater was
   continuously supplied to the process retaining biomass at 8000mg
   VSSl(-1). Phenol was completely removed, and ammonia was simultaneously
   nitrified to nitrate; nitrification rate reached 200mg Nl(-1) d(-1) when
   phenol was removed at a rate up to 300 mgl(-1) d(-1). It was observed
   that 0-13\% of the ammonia was removed via denitrification. Intermittent
   aeration enhanced the denitrification rate to 160 mg Nl(-1) d(-1) by
   utilizing phenol, and approximately 24\% of the denitrified nitrogen was
   recovered as nitrous oxide. Methanol, which is the most commonly used
   electron donor in conventional nitrogen removal processes, did not
   enhance the denitrification rate of the phenol-acclimated activated
   sludge used in this study, however phenol did. The results suggest that
   this process potentially works as a space- and energy-saving nitrogen
   removal process by utilizing substances inhibitory to nitrifiers as
   electron donors for denitrification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Biotreatment of aquaculture water for recirculation purposes is a
   sensible mean to support the further growth of aquaculture industry
   without excessive water demands that are environmentally unsustainable.
   This study evaluates the efficacy of biofilter treatment of an eel
   (Anguilla japonica) culture pond water using different filter media and
   flow scheme arrangements. The experimental results demonstrate that
   biofilter systems packed with suitable filter media are capable of
   improving the quality of effluents for recirculation applications. The
   characteristics of the filter media appear to be more critical than
   biofilter flow scheme arrangements in affecting the efficacy of the
   biofilter treatment. Filter media with surface and structural
   characteristics are conducive to the development of biofilms and the
   capture of organic suspended matter are desirable to ensure good and
   consistent biofilter performance. Under such circumstances, the
   bacterial ``consortia{''} in the biofilter are capable of utilizing the
   captured organic suspended matter as an alternative substrate to support
   their metabolic activities when the concentration of the primary
   substrate (i.e., BOD) is low. For the eel pond water, a biofilter packed
   with filter media having cross-link structures and a high bed porosity,
   followed by another biofilter packed with a type of filter media having
   rough surfaces, produced the best results under the conditions tested.
   Moreover, a preliminary cost-benefit analysis confirms its cost
   advantages. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The inactivation behaviour of the bacteriophages PHI X 174 (ssDNA
   virus), MS2 (ssRNA virus) and B40-8 (dsDNA) toward non-ionizing
   (LTV-253.7nm) as well as to ionizing radiation (gamma radiation) was
   studied in order to evaluate their potential as viral indicators for
   water disinfection by irradiation. Previous findings of the high
   UV-253.7nm resistance of MS2 were confirmed whereas an unexpected high
   sensitivity to gamma radiation compared to the two other pha.-es was
   found. On the other hand, PHI X 174 revealed an enhanced UV sensitivity
   but a high resistance to ionizing radiation. B40-8 had an intermediate
   position between the other two bacteriophages relative to both types of
   radiation. As expected, the data of E. coli reconfirmed the
   unreliability of fecal indicator bacteria for the purpose of predicting
   responses of viruses to water treatment. In UV disinfection the
   influence of water matrix may be adequately controlled by considering
   the UV (253.7 nm) absorption of the water whereas so far no such
   parameter has existed for the influence of the water quality on ionizing
   irradiation with respect to the scavenger concentration. (C) 2001

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Abstract = {{Levee sump systems are used by many riverine communities for temporary
   storage of urban wet weather flows. The performance and transport of
   stormwater pollutants in sump systems, however, have not been
   systematically studied. Although flow of stormwater through a sump
   system is regulated solely by flood-control requirements, these sumps
   may function as sedimentation basins that provide purification of
   stormwater. The objective of this paper is to present a case study of
   stormwater and sediment analysis for conventional pollutants in flood
   control sumps in an urban watershed. Two sumps of highly variable
   physical and hydraulic characteristics were selected for analysis. The
   results suggest that: (1) first-flush samples may not give an accurate
   picture of outfall concentrations of stormwater to the sump; (2)
   time-variable concentrations of pollutants in a sump are related to the
   hydraulic characteristics of the basin; and, (3) post-event sediment
   analysis provides verification of pollutant capture in the sumps. This
   study is an initial step toward development of a more comprehensive
   management model for flood control sumps that incorporates their
   hydraulic performance for quantitative assessment of pollutant loads,
   pollutant discharges, and pollutant removals with respect to the sumps.

Abstract = {{The feasibility of an integrated biological and physiochemical water
   treatment process for nitrate and fluoride removal has been evaluated.
   It consisted of two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) in series.
   Performance of the process in the treatment of 24 synthetic water
   samples having nitrate concentrations of 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, and 250
   mg/l (as N) and fluoride concentrations of 6, 10, 15, and 20 mg/l at
   different combinations was studied. Denitrification followed by
   defluoridation proved to be the best sequence of treatment. In all cases
   nitrate could be reduced to an acceptable level of less than 10 mg/l (as
   N) at 3, 5, and 7 h hydraulic retention times (HRTs) depending on its
   initial concentration. Fluoride concentrations Lip to 15 mg/l associated
   with nitrate concentrations up to 80 mg/l (as N) could be reduced to an
   acceptable level of 1.5mg/l by alum-PAC slurry using alum doses up to
   850mg/l {[}as Al-2(SO4)(3).16H(2)O] along with 100mg/l of powdered
   activated carbon (PAC). Additional alkalinity produced during
   denitrification was used up during defluoridation for maintenance of pH
   avoiding the need for lime addition. On the other hand, residual
   organics, turbidity, and sulfide present in the denitrified water were
   removed by alum and PAC at the defluoridation stage along with fluoride,
   eliminating the need for an additional post-treatment step. At higher
   nitrate concentrations (greater than or equal to 120 mg/l as N) the
   alkalinity produced at the denitrification stage was in the range of
   715-1175 mg/l as CaCO3. This excessive alkalinity inhibited reduction of
   fluoride to the level of 1.5 mg/l at the defluoridation stage, using
   alum doses up to 900 mg/l along with 100 mg/l of PAC. In all cases, a
   fluoride concentration of 20 mg/1 in water could not be reduced to the
   acceptable level of 1.5mg/l. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Membrane filtration technology for application of wastewater treatment
   has been developing recently. In the application to wastewater
   treatment, it is major concern to remove cake layer on membrane surface
   effectively with crossflow shear stress. Hydraulic effect of sludge
   accumulation process on membrane surface in bubble and non-bubble driven
   crossflow filtration was studied. Maximum sludge accumulation, sludge
   accumulation rate, and lag phase were introduced to describe sludge
   accumulation process, and the effects of hydraulic conditions were
   clarified experimentally. Maximum sludge accumulation and sludge
   accumulation rate were dependent on aeration intensity, and were less
   depend on flow channel width and MLSS concentration. Their tendencies
   were explained by shear stress. Shear stress was thought to be the major
   hydraulic factor that influences them. Lag phase was dependent on
   aeration intensity, flow channel width, and MLSS concentration. A
   non-dimensional equation was proposed to explain dependencies of flow
   channel width based on consideration of hydraulic behavior of MLSS
   particles and shear stress. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The removal of dyes from textile dying wastewater by recycled alum
   sludge (RAS) generated by the coagulation process itself was studied and

   to examine the performance of this process. It was found that RAS is a
   good way of removing hydrophobic dye in wastewater, while simultaneously
   reducing the fresh alum dosage, of which one third of the fresh alum can
   be saved. The back-diffusion of residued dye from the recycling sludge
   is detected but is easily controlled as long as a small amount of fresh
   alum is added to the system. The use of RAS is not recommended for the
   removal of hydrophilic dyes, since the high solubility characteristics
   of such dyes can cause deterioration in the water quality during

Abstract = {{Kinetic characterization of biological processes via batch respirometry
   requires an accurate estimate of the biomass yield coefficient because
   it provides the stoichiometric link between biomass synthesis, substrate
   consumption and oxygen uptake. Expressions for biomass yield
   coefficients describing autotrophic ammonia and nitrite oxidation were
   derived from a mechanistically based electron balanced equation. We
   demonstrate that applying the conventional expression used to calculate
   the heterotrophic biomass yield results in erroneous estimates for the
   autotrophic biomass yield. Yield coefficients for autotrophic NH4+-N to
   NO2--N oxidation and NH4+-N to NO3-N oxidation were overestimated by 27
   to 36\%. Due to correlation between the maximum specific growth rate and
   the biomass yield, the error in yield values propagated in 30 to 40\%
   overestimates of the maximum specific growth rate coefficient for NH4+-N
   oxidation determined from batch respirograms. Therefore, it is essential
   to employ the correct expression to estimate the autotrophic biomass
   yield coefficient from batch respirograms due its inadvertent impact on
   subsequent parameter estimation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A set of ecological indicators including structural, functional, and
   system-level aspects were proposed for a lake ecosystem health
   assessment, according to the structural, functional, and system-level
   responses of lake ecosystems to chemical stresses including
   acidification, eutrophication, and copper, oil and pesticide
   contamination. The structural indicators included phytoplankton cell
   size and biomass, zooplankton body size and biomass, species diversity,
   macro- and micro-zooplankton biomass, the zooplankton/phytoplankton
   ratio, and the macrozooplankton/microzooplankton ratio. The functional
   indicators encompassed the algal C assimilation ratio, resource use
   efficiency, community production, gross production/respiration (i.e.
   P/R) ratio, gross production/standing crop biomass (i.e. P/B) ratio, and
   standing crop biomass/unit energy flow (i.e. BIE) ratio. The
   ecosystem-level indicators consisted of ecological buffer capacities,
   exergy, and structural exergy. Based on these indicators, a direct
   measurement method (DMM) and an ecological modeling method (EMM) for
   lake ecosystem health assessment were developed. The DMM procedures were
   designed to: (1) identify key indicators; (2) measure directly or
   calculate indirectly the selected indicators; and, (3) assess ecosystem
   health on the basis of the indicator values. The EMM procedures were
   designed to: (1) determine the structure and complexity of the
   ecological model according to the lake's ecosystem structure; (2)
   establish an ecological model by designing a conceptual diagram,
   establishing model equations, and estimating model parameters; (3)
   compare the simulated values of important state variables and process
   rates with actual observations; (4) calculate ecosystem health
   indicators using the ecological model; and, (5) assess lake ecosystem
   health according to the values of the ecological indicators. The results
   of a case study demonstrated that both methods provided similar results
   which corresponded with the lake's actual trophic state. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have been carried out on the environmental factors
   associated with the decay of faecal bacteria in open (fresh or marine)
   waters. The present study aimed at understanding the fate of bacteria in
   small streams (flow < 20 m(3) s(-1)) for which there is a lack of
   knowledge. An original in situ protocol was developed for measuring the
   die-off of Escherichia coli (E. coh) from wastewater treatment Plants.
   Based upon 80 values of the decay first-order parameter (K or its
   inverse T90), collected from five rivers in Normandy (France), a median
   T90 of 10 It and a minimal T90 of 1.3 h were obtained. K was then
   modelled as a linear function of variables made up from flow, water
   temperature and suspended particulate matter (SPM). The set of
   significant co-variables did not include light indicators. E. coli decay
   is inversely related to the river flow and it becomes highly significant
   below 0.3 m(3) s-1. The positive effect of small flows on die-off is
   increased by water temperature over 15<degrees>C. whereas it could be
   reduced by SPM. The major co-variable of the model (p< 10(-9)) is an
   empiric composite variable integrating the effect of flow and
   temperature that explains more than 40\% of the variance of K. We
   interpreted this as kin expression of predation by benthic micro-grazers
   which could be the main cause of E. coli die-off in small streams in
   temperate countries. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{The electrokinetic properties of gamma -irradiated Cryptosporidium
   oocysts in the presence of coagulants (ferric chloride and alum) and
   coagulant aids (DADMAC based cationic polyelectrolytes) have been
   studied. The zeta potential of the oocysts was unaffected by the
   addition of ferric chloride at all pH values (3-10) studied. Addition of
   alum resulted in reversal of the oocysts charge, which suggests that the
   initial stage in the coagulation process leading to floc formation
   proceeds via the adsorption of hydrolysed aluminium species. The
   cationic polyelectrolyte Magnafloc LT35 was adsorbed onto iron flocs at
   doses of 0.1 mg/L even against an electrostatic barrier. The cationic
   polyelectrolyte only adsorbed and caused charge reversal at the oocyst
   surface at around 0.4 mg/L, suggesting a lower affinity for this
   surface. These results indicate that the oocysts, unlike inorganic
   colloidal materials such as metal oxides, appear to possess a lower
   surface density of active or charged sites. The lower density of sites,
   combined with the rapid precipitation of iron salts, may be responsible
   for the lack of specific adsorption of either hydroxylated ferric
   species or primary iron hydroxide particles on the oocysts. Further,
   this suggests that a process of sweep flocculation, where oocysts are
   engulfed in flocs during coagulation and floc formation, is the more
   likely mechanism involved. By comparison, it is likely that the specific
   interaction of hydrolysed aluminium species with the oocysts surface
   would result in a stronger link at the oocyst-floc interface and that
   the flocculation process may initially proceed via charge
   neutralisation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   precipitation of magnesium ammonium phosphate could be excluded. The
   elemental composition of polyphosphate granules was investigated by
   electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The
   elements Ca, Mg and K were the principal metal components of
   polyphosphate granules. Concerning the metal composition, different
   types of granules could be distinguished. The quantitative ratios of Ca,

Abstract = {{A field survey indicated that the Elbe and Saale Rivers were
   contaminated with both clofibric acid and ibuprofen. In Elbe River water
   we could detect the metabolite hydroxy-ibuprofen. Analyses of the city
   of Saskatoon sewage effluent discharged to the South Saskatchewan river
   detected clofibric acid but neither ibuprofen nor any metabolite.
   Laboratory studies indicated that the pharmaceutical ibuprofen was
   readily degraded in a river biofilm reactor. Two metabolites were
   detected and identified as hydroxy- and carboxy-ibuprofen. Both
   metabolites were observed to degrade in the biofilm reactors. However,
   in human metabolism the metabolite carboxy-ibuprofen appears and
   degrades second whereas the opposite occurs in biofilm systems. In
   biofilms the pharmacologically inactive stereoisomere of ibuprofen is
   degraded predominantly. In contrast, clofibric acid was not biologically
   degraded during the experimental period of 21 days. Similar results were
   obtained using biofilms developed using waters from either the South
   Saskatchewan or Elbe River. In a sterile reactor no losses of ibuprofen
   were observed. These results suggested that abiotic losses and
   adsorption played only a minimal role in the fate of the pharmaceuticals
   in the river biofilm reactors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An open pit-lake was formed at a Northern Saskatchewan mine site after
   flooding with lake water in early 1992. Since then, water and
   phytoplankton samples have been collected regularly from the artificial
   lake over seven years. The resulting data set provides a unique
   opportunity to examine the physical and chemical changes in water
   quality and phytoplankton community over time. Seventeen major variables
   were examined in a principal component analysis. Axes 1, 2 and 4 are
   significantly correlated to other three variables, the number of days
   (since the first sampling after flooding of the pit), water temperature
   and depth, respectively. Total suspended solid (TSS), dissolved oxygen,

Abstract = {{This work numerically investigates the hydrodynamic drag force exerted
   on a porous spheroid floe moving steadily through a quiescent Newtonian
   fluid over a wide range of the Reynolds number. The flow patterns for a
   highly porous spheroid moving at an elevated Reynolds number are
   basically the same as those at low Reynolds number, which extends the
   applicable range of a creeping-flow based correlation to the higher
   Reynolds number regime. The shape effect becomes more prominent as the
   spheroid becomes more porous. Using the equivalent diameter, defined as
   the geometric mean diameter of the principal axes, leads to a universal
   correlation relating to the drag force, aspect ratio, and interior
   permeability. In addition, free-settling experiments are performed to
   estimate how the non-spherical shape affects the three sludge samples.
   The possible errors in data reduction for the free-settling test are
   attributed to the a/b ratio and the internal permeability. The errors
   range from 16-34\% for a/b = 0.6-2.0. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Hydrogen peroxide was produced by direct current electrolysis using two
   electrodes only, a carbon felt cathode and a dimensional stabilised
   anode (titanium coated with RuO2), without adding any chemical. The
   required oxygen was supplied by water oxidation and by transfer from the
   atmosphere. The intensity should be maintained under a maximum value to
   avoid peroxide reduction. High peroxide production rate and
   concentration were then reached. Electroperoxidation partially removed
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contained in solutions of phenol,
   salicylic acid, benzoic acid and humic acids. The DOC removal in
   effluent of municipal sewage plant corresponded to a breakage of the
   double bonds. Real effluents were significantly disinfected owing to the
   direct effect of electric current and the indirect effect of peroxide.
   Moreover, a remnant effect was ensured. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   the chloride concentration leads to a faster TOC degradation compared to
   the treatment of non-desalinated wastewater, Furthermore, the additional

Abstract = {{A home-made magnetic device was built with permanent magnets for
   treating scaling waters. Its efficiency was evaluated by measuring the
   remaining ionic calcium at the output of the device by means of an ion
   selective electrode. The scaling power of the treated water was
   estimated through an electrochemical scaling test. Chroamperometric
   curves and chronoelectrogravimetric curves were plotted to obtain the
   scaling time and the nucleation time of the scale deposition. The
   variation of the efficiency of the magnetic treatment was studied when
   the length of treatment, the flow velocity of the scaling water in the
   device, the material of the pipe where the scaling water flowed were
   changed. An empirical relationship, which gives the value of the
   efficiency in function of the length of treatment and the flow velocity,
   was proposed. Possible mechanisms of action of the magnetic treatment
   were discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofiltration is generally used to separate monovalent ions from
   divalent ions, but it is also possible to separate ions of the same
   valency by careful application of the transfer mechanisms involved.
   Analysis of the retention of halide salts reveals that small ions like
   fluoride are the best retained, and that this is even more marked under
   reduced pressure when selectivity is greatest. The selectivity
   desalination of fluorinated brackish water is hence feasible and
   drinking water can be produced directly at much lower cost than using
   reverse osmosis by optimizing the pressure for the type of water
   treated. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The BAC-process for treatment of waste water containing non-ionogenic
   synthetic surfactants}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3265-3271}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper experimental results on the biological-activated carbon
   (BAC)-process for biological degradation and adsorption of non-ionogenic
   surfactants (NISS) in the waste water treatment are discussed. It is
   shown that the mechanism of the BAC-process is not the simple addition
   but the synergetic combination of biodegradation and carbon adsorption.
   The major aspects of such synergism are the biological regeneration
   (bioregeneration) of the adsorbent and the reduction of the toxic effect
   of waste water contaminants on microorganisms. It is shown that the
   basis of the bioregeneration process is the desorption of substances
   previously adsorbed on the activated carbon. The desorption from
   micropores takes place because of the reverse concentration gradient,
   due to the microbial degradation of waste water contaminants in the
   liquid phase. The desorption from mesopores is also supported by the
   activity of microorganisms exoenzymes. Thus, the process of
   bioregeneration is featured by two noncontradictory hypotheses. (C) 2001

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3276-3279}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Photolysis experiments were performed to quantify the effect of three
   anionic surfactants on the photolysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at the
   ambient laboratory temperature of 22+/-1 degreesC. H2O2 photolysis in
   water, methanol, and surfactant monomeric solution was also conducted to
   compare the photochemical reactivity of H2O2 in different media.
   Photolysis rates were highest for water, followed by micellar solutions,
   and lowest for methanol. The results show that the photochemical
   reactivity of H2O2 is les favorable in organic solvent than in water and
   surfactant micelles affect H2O2 photolysis. Retarded photolysis of H2O2
   in micellar solutions implies that a fraction of H2O2 dissolved in water
   partitions into micellar pseudophase of surfactant. H2O2 partitioned
   into micelles has less photochemical reactivity and thus photolysis rate
   was retarded in the presence of micelles. Photolysis inhibitory level by
   micelles was shown to be dependent on the kinds of surfactants used in
   this study. In addition, the inhibitory effect by surfactant monomers
   was negligible due to the absence of micelles. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Using digested municipal sludge as the inoculum and either rutin,
   quercetin or hesperidin as the sole external carbon source, methanogenic
   consortia were enriched which converted various flavonoids at initial
   concentration of 0.5-3.0 mM during stationary incubation at 37 degreesC
   in serum bottles with specific rates ranging from 0.025 to 0.073 mu mol
   min(-1) (mg protein)(-1). In the culture fluid, several hydroxyaromatic
   metabolites as well as VFA (acetate. propionate, n-butyrate) were
   detected and biogas was formed in the headspace of the rest bottles.
   Most of these metabolites were identified. Based on their sequential
   appearance,:disappearance in the test cultures it was concluded that
   following initial hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond by cellular enzymes,
   ring C of the flavane skeleton was hydrolytically cleaved yielding an A-
   and B-ring fission product. In case of the flavonol quercetin,
   phlorogiucinol (A-ring) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate (B-ring) were
   identified as the fission products whereas the flavanone hesperetin was
   cleaved with formation of phloroglucinol (A-ring) and
   3,4-dihydroxyphenylpropionate (B-ring). In pre-adapted subcultures
   amended with either hesperidin or hesperetin, all of the: formed
   hydroxyaromatic metabolites disappeared within 100 h of incubation
   whereas in the culture medium of rutin and quercetin degrading consortia
   m-cresol (3-methylphenol) was formed as the ultimate hydroxyaromatic
   metabolite being detectable in considerable amounts even after prolonged
   incubation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a lab-scale two-stage digester (consisting of an acidification and a
   methane reactor) operated continuously with high-loaded brewery
   wastewater (empty set empty set COD 9.000 mg l(-1)) as the primary
   substrate, the cofermentation of two commonly found flavonoids (rutin
   and hesperidin) was studied. At overall hydraulic retention times of
   48-50 h and organic loading rates in the methane reactor ranging From 8
   to 10 g COD l(R)(-1) d(-1) the addition or up to 0.71 g l(R)(-1) d(-1)
   of either rutin or hesperidin did not cause adverse effects on the
   reactor performance. in terms of VFA pattern, COD removal efficiency,
   and specific biogas production. The added flavonoid glycosides were
   rapidly converted in the acidification reactor yielding several
   hydroxyaromatic metabolites. With hesperidin as the cosubstrate, all of
   the formed metabolites were completely removed during passage through
   the methane reactor whereas in case of rutin. substantial amounts of
   m-cresol and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate were built up in the medium and
   remained in the effluent of the methane reactor. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mutagenicity of water, including herbicide CNP, and its
   time-variation during anaerobic biodegradation were studied through Ames
   assay using strains with or without. S9 mix: TA98 TA100. YG1021. YG1024,
   YG1026, and YG1029. The bacteria, for the anaerobic biodegradation, was
   obtained from a paddy field, and preincubated for a month. The CNP was
   decomposed in an anaerobic culture inoculated with the bacteria, and
   finally yielded CNP-amino as one of the CNP metabolites. About 16\% of
   the initial CNP was transformed into CNP-amino bq the 14th day. The
   mutagenicities to TA98. YG1024. and YG1029 strains with S9 mix increased
   with cultivating time, the latter two showed the strongest sensitivity
   to CNP-amino. The contribution of CNP to the mutagenicity decreased as
   the chemical decomposed, while the contribution of CNP-amino increased.
   However, the increased mutagenicity was not limited to the contribution
   of CNP-amino, but also to the contribution of other metabolites. The
   contributions of other CNP metabolites were 67\% of total mutagenicity
   to the TA98 strain and 30\% to the YG1029 strain. These unknown
   mutagenic metabolites were the indirect frameshift mutagens which did
   not have nitro- and amino-substituents, and the indirect base-pair
   mutagens which might possibly have some amino-substituents. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Naphthenic acids (NAs) are a complex mixture of naturally occurring
   acyclic and cyclic aliphatic carboxylic acids in petroleum. In the
   Athabasca oil sands, NAs have been identified as the largest component
   of dissolved organic matter in the tailings waters From oils sands
   extraction processes. They are the major contributor to the acute
   toxicity of the fine tailings wastewaters at the oil sands extraction
   plants in northeastern Alberta. Canada. In this study, three sources of
   NAs were studied. including commercially available NAs, those extracted
   from oil sands process-affected waters, and individual naphthenic-like
   surrogate compounds. Analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   demonstrated differences between the commercial and extracted NAs. The
   NAs derived from the process-affected waters showed a short-term
   inhibition of methanogenesis from H-2 or acetate. hut with time the
   populations resumed methane production. It has been postulated that
   microbial metabolism of the carboxylated side chains of NAs would lead
   to methane production, The two NA mixtures failed to stimulate
   methanogenesis in microcosms that contained either oil sands fine
   tailings or domestic sewage sludge However, in microcosms with sewage
   sludge, methanogenesis was stimulated by some surrogate NAs including
   3-cyclohexylpropanoic acid at 400 800 mg/L, 5-cyclohexylpentanoic acid
   at 200 mg/L or 6-phenylhexanoic acid at 200 and 400 mg/L. When added at
   200 mg-L to methanogenic microcosms containing fine tailings,
   3-cyclohexylpropanoic and 4-cyclohexylbutanoic acids produced methane
   yields that suggested mineralization of the side chain and the ring. (C)

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to illustrate an ideal method For
   characterizing natural waters for ozonation processes in drinking water
   treatment plants. A specific instrument designed with the flow injection
   analysis (FIA) technique enabled us to measure accurately the ozone
   decomposition rate, which was found to consist of two stages: the
   instantaneous ozone consumption stage and the slower ozone decay stage.
   The ozone consumption rate was measured at the initial and secondary
   stages by determining certain parameters called the instantaneous ozone
   demand (ID) and the pseudo first-order decay rate constant (k(c)). Using
   the OH . -probe the yield of OH . per consumed ozone was also measured
   to determine its potential ti, produce OH . for the oxidation of
   micropollutants during the ozonation process. The ozone consumption of
   the ID values was significant in most natural waters, and substantial
   amounts of OH . were found to generate during the instantaneous ozone
   consumption stage. This study also investigated the effects of
   particulates, ozone doses, and sequential ozone injection on ozone
   decomposition kinetics and OH . formation yield. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of pretreating activated sludge with sulfuric acid and
   surfactant on its exocellular polymer(ECP), dewaterability and
   settleability was investigated. It was observed that the centrifugal
   dewatering efficiency was increased with the decrease of sludge pH
   value, and which was further improved if the surfactant was
   simultaneously applied. However, to the filtration dewatering, the water
   content reached the minimum in the case of pH 2.5, and the additional
   use of surfactant was also favorable. The: water content of sludge
   dewatered with filtration reached 73.99\%; when a pH 2.5 and a 0.1 g
   surfactant were employed, which was reduced by around 2\% as compared
   with surfactant unused. Experimental results indicated that the sludge
   sedimentation rate was significantly accelerated under pH 2.5 condition.
   and which was increased once more by the utilization of surfactant.
   Further studies revealed that treating activated sludge with sulfuric
   acid at pH 2.5 or combined with surfactant was an effective method to
   remove the polymers from sludge surface and induced the decrease of ECP,
   which resulted in the improvement of dewaterability and settleability.
   This study suggested the potentiality of improving activated sludge
   mechanical dewaterability by the use of sulfuric acid to control its pH
   at 2.5 or together with a surfactant. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail

Abstract = {{The change of the toxicity of chlorinated water after chlorine injection

   respectively. Activity inducing chromosomal aberrations of chlorinated
   humic acid gradually decreased with time after chlorination. In
   contrast, activity inducing transformations measured by the two-stage
   assay gradually increased. Thus, the toxicity that decreases or
   increases is present in chlorinated water. Furthermore, activity
   inducing transformations measured by the non-two-stage assay gradually
   decreased. This direction of change was reverse to that of activity
   inducing transformations by the two-stage assay and consistent with that
   of activity inducing chromosomal aberrations. It is speculated that the
   main reason of decreasing activity inducing transformations by the
   non-two-stage assay is because initiating activity detected as activity
   inducing chromosomal aberrations in chlorinated water decreases
   drastically. Directions of changes of total organic halogen and carbonyl
   group were qualitatively consistent with that of activity inducing
   chromosomal aberrations. Directions of changes of chloroform and
   dichloroacetic acid were qualitatively consistent with that of activity
   inducing transformations by the two-stage assay. Findings of this study
   suggest that further research is necessary to compare carcinogenicity of
   tap water near water purification plant and distant lap water. (C) 2001

   in the first 24 h of the experiments (63. 65, 72 and 74\% of the added
   Cd for 1, 2. 4 and 6 mg Cd l(-1), respectively) After 31 days of growth.
   Pistia stratiotes efficiently removed Cd at the studied concentrations.
   The macrophyte was able to keep its capacity for Cd removal even though
   some toxicity symptoms appeared at 4 and 6 mg Cd l(-1). The greater the
   initial concentration, the greater Cd bioaccumulation rates, The
   increase of Cd concentration in plant tissues occurred especially in
   roots and was linearly related to the quantity of Cd added. Cd sorption

Abstract = {{The mechanism of sediment motion that affects cadmium (Cd) adsorption on
   sediment particles was studied in a turbulence tank in the presence (and

   mathematical model for heavy metal transport-transformation developed
   for the turbulence tank. The mathematical model includes the equations
   of water Row, sediment motion. heavy metal transport-transformation.
   heavy-metal reaction kinematics and equations for prescribing the
   initial conditions and boundary conditions for the experiment. The model
   conforms the transport transformation of heavy-metal pollutants in
   surface waters to following the law of convective-diffusive of common
   tracers and the characteristics of fare and transport of sediment
   motion. Variations of dissolved Cd concentrations and suspended
   particulate Cd concentrations with time and in the water column were
   measured and computed. The experimental measurements correspond with the
   computed results. Both the experimental measurements and computed
   results show that it takes about 6 h to reach equilibrium condition for
   cadmium adsorption by sediment particles. This is different from the
   result obtained from experiments conducted in continuously stirred tank
   reactors (or batch reactors) in which adsorption equilibrium can be
   achieved in about 20 min. Determination of the model parameters for
   sediment adsorption-desorption of metals in the tank is discussed. The

Abstract = {{Increased focus on the possible evironmental risk associated with
   large-scale use of grouting agents has revealed that leakage of
   chemicals from grouting activities may cause harm to the environment.
   Chemical grouting agents are used to reduce water leakages in e.g.
   tunnel constructions. The present study focuses on monitoring results
   and environmental risk caused by releases of non-polymerised monomers
   during use of the acrylamide-based grouting agent Rhoca-Gil (Siprogel).
   Drainage water From the tunnel Romeriksporten was monitored with respect
   to acrylamide and methylolacrylamide. as leakage of these substances was
   observed earlier in connection with similar constructions where
   Rhoca-Gil was used. Concentrations of acrylamide and methylolacrylamide
   in the draining water showed that these substances leaked nut both in
   connection with the injection of Rhoca-Gil and in connection with
   after-injection using other grouting agents. Gel formation studies with
   Rhoca-Gil showed that a low degree of polymerisation land hence, large
   leakages of monomers) can be expected if the product is diluted with
   water. Results From investigation of the environmental fate of
   methylolacrylamide showed that this substance is chemically transformed
   at the high-pH conditions of the tunnel. Ecotoxicological testing of the
   substances and an environmental effects assessment for the receiving
   water (River Alna and the Oslofjord) showed th;lt the discharge of
   acrylamide and methylolacrylamide may have caused effects on the aquatic
   life in the river and in a limited area of the fjord. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Over a period of one year (June 1997-May 1998) samples of surface
   waters, used for domestic and recreational purposes. were collected
   weekly from the same sites on the Klip River and Vaal Dam, Gauteng.
   South Africa. Sensitive and specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase
   chain reaction-oligonucleotide probe assays were used to detect HAV and
   HAstV RNA in concentrates of the water and infectious virus in cell
   cultures infected with the water concentrates. HAV was detected in
   18(35.3\%) of the river and 19 (37.3\%) of the dam water samples. often
   in association with the RNA from other enteric viruses. HAstV was
   detected less frequently and was present in 11 (21.6\%) of the river and
   3 (5.9\%) of the dam water samples. A seasonal pattern was noted for HAV
   but not for HAstV. Cell culture amplification in a variety of carefully
   selected cell culture systems enhanced the detection of both viruses.
   Infectious viruses were detected in dam water samples where
   microbiological indicators of faecal pollution were absent or within
   acceptable limits. Thr presence of these viruses in the dam and river
   water could pose a potential health risk for people using these waters
   for domestic or recreational purposes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Till now the role of storage in activated sludge processes under
   transient conditions has been deeply investigated under anaerobic (EBPR
   processes) or aerobic (bulking control) environments. Little attention
   has been given to the role of storage in processes including anoxic
   environments. Hence, the aim of the present work was to investigate the
   anoxic storage along with other substrate removal mechanisms under
   transient conditions. Several mixed culture were ad hoc selected under
   anoxic environment and periodic feeding (acetate as carbon source) at
   different organic load rate (OLR) and feed length: then their transient
   response to substrate spike was investigated by batch tests under both
   anoxic and aerobic conditions. The relative role of different mechanisms
   in the substrate removal was established on the basis of COD balance
   assuming that the acetate COD removed from the liquid phase could be
   oxidised for energy needs or recovered into solids as
   poly-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) (storage), other internal precursors or
   intermediates (accumulation) and active biomass (growth, as estimated by
   ammonium uptake). In all tested conditions, growth response was very
   little while PHB storage was prevailing. In some operating conditions,
   indirect evidence of accumulation (in forms still to be identified) was
   also Found. The transient response was not affected by the presence of
   free amino acids, at least For the unacclimated mixed culture under
   observation. Transient response under aerobic condition was quite
   similar to the anoxic one. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of adding suspended matter in the form of clay or metal oxide
   when a cationic polymer was employed as the primary coagulant was found
   to be beneficial. The solids provide both an adsorbent for natural
   organic matter (NOM) and a nucleating species For precipitating the
   NOM-polymer complex. Metal oxides in conjunction with a cationic polymer
   were more promising than clay, with effectiveness in the order Fe2O3 >
   Fe3O4 > Al2O3 >MnO2. Magnesium oxide at a much lower dose was nearly as
   effective as ferric oxide, but of course raised the pH level
   significantly. A simpler and more convenient way of having reactive
   solids present was to add alum to form Aocs; for one of the waters
   studied the alum dose could be reduced by 67\% by adding 1 mg/L of
   polymer, to give equal or better performance than alum alone at the
   optimum dose. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the contribution of both organic and inorganic nutrients
   to biofilm development and the subsequent Impact of developed biofilms
   on disinfectant decay are important requirements For distribution system
   management strategies. Nutrient limitation may be one way to control
   biofilm development without increasing disinfectant dosing. Little is
   known. however, of the nutrient requirements of biofilms in distribution
   systems. Indeed. the effects on biofilm development due to the addition
   of nutrients to distribution systems and what impact biofilm development
   may have on disinfectant decay is still poorly understood. This study
   used annular reactors to determine the nutrients limiting for biofilm
   development in drinking water from two different Sydney sources and the
   subsequent effects of biofilm development on disinfectant decay. It was
   round that biofilm development in Sydney water was limited by organic
   carbon and that biofilm development promoted chloramine decay. Moreover.
   biofilm development occurred in the presence of chloramine. The ability
   of biofilms to respond to increases in disinfectant concentrations was
   dependent on the biomass of the biofilms. In a comparative study using
   chlorinated drinking water containing ver); low levels of organic
   carbon. biofilm development was not detected. Removal of organic carbon
   resulted in greater persistence of chlorine, which led to greater
   biofilm control. It was also shown that biofilms could contribute cells
   to the aqueous phase. The results of the study indicate rh;lt treatment
   and system management strategies should incorporate organic carbon
   removal to limit biofilm development through a combination of retarding
   bacterial growth and enhancing disinfectant persistence. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The mitigative effects of the deep tunnel for temporary storage of storm
   water and sewage, on the water qualify of the Milwaukee. Menomonee, and

   parameters (BOD, phosphorus, suspended solid. fecal coliform counts,
   zinc, and chloride) in the three rivers indicates that Menomonee River
   benefits the most from the deep tunnel. Fecal coliform counts inside the
   CSO area, and to a certain extent BOD and zinc levels, exhibit the most
   significant decline after 1994 when the tunnel came on line. These
   conclusions are based on t-test comparisons of regional averages
   incorporating spatial and temporal correlations from 1991 to 1993 and
   1994 to 1997. The results from r-tests are complemented and confirmed
   with results from Mann-Kendall tests Tor trend. Suspended solids and

Abstract = {{Bacteria in activated sludge are subjected to periods of substrate
   availability and absence of external substrates. The response of
   bacteria to such dynamic conditions was studied in a 2 L sequencing
   batch reactor (SBR) by subjecting a mixed microbial population to
   successive periods of external substrate availability (feast period) and
   no external substrate availability (famine period). In previous studies.
   acetate or glucose was used as single substrate leading to the storage
   of polyhydroxybutyrate or glycogen, respectively. In this study, a
   mixture of acetate and glucose was used. It appeared that both
   substrates were consumed simultaneously. The relative contribution of
   growth and storage processes was in these experiments similar as in the
   systems fed with a single substrate only. The ratio of substrate uptake
   over substrate storage was 0.6 Cmol/Cmol For both substrates. The uptake
   rate of acetate was not influenced by the simultaneous: uptake of
   glucose. The degradation kinetics and rates of the storage compounds
   were the same as for the systems in which only one compound was stored
   in the activated sludge. The global performance of the culture grown on
   mixed substrates could therefore be described as the sum of the
   conversions observed in cultures fed with the individual substrates. (C)

Abstract = {{This study compares the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and
   respiration rates of a microbial population treating real and synthetic
   greywaters dosed with nutrient supplements. The nutrient composition of
   the real and synthetic greywaters was analysed and the dosing regime for
   nitrogen, phosphorus and a range of trace metals planned accordingly.
   The doses consisted of eight single additives (macronutrients and trace
   metals) to the control greywater and six trace metal additions to C:N:P
   balanced greywater. The COD removal for the control real and synthetic
   greywater in lab-scale activated sludge systems (0.038 and 0.286 kg COD
   kg MLSS-1 d(-1). respectively) confirmed nutrient limitation and the
   poor degree of greywater treatment. Nutrient dosing increased the COD
   removal rate and oxygen uptake rate in many cases. The greatest
   stimulation of microbial activity was observed with zinc additions lo
   C:N:P balanced real greywater (1.291 kg COD kg MLSS-1 d(-1) over 30
   times the control). Inhibitory effects to various extents were rare and
   limited mainly to the additions of metals to synthetic greywater. The
   dominance of chemicals effects was observed on addition of some
   micronutrients: notably iron and aluminium, metals on which many
   coagulants for use in biotreatment of other wastewaters are based. The
   data indicate that the impact of understanding microbial processes and
   the nutrients required For wastewater treatment can only serve to
   optimise process efficiency for the proposed treatment of greywater. (C)

   modelling approach was proposed. Only three specific parameters were
   calibrated. Two parameters, the inert fraction in the influent and the
   actual anoxic sludge fraction will need calibration for all systems.
   parameter sensitivity analyses showed that the sensitivity of
   operational data. often considered as known input data, is high. The
   model kinetics were round less sensitive. This a ill in general be the
   case for all low-loaded wwtp's recorded in their pseudo-steady state.
   Based on mass balance calculations, operational data and measurements
   were evaluated. Since all term on a phosphorus balance can be measured,
   errors in operational data (e.g. SRT and flow rates) become very
   apparent in P-removal models (ASM2d, TUDP). We suggest using the
   P-balance in general for wwtp modelling. as a check on data consistency.
   This study showed that considering operational data per definition as
   known input data is not justified. Therefore, operational data should he
   evaluated. or considered in model calibration over the use of kinetic
   and stoichiometric parameters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   Kinetic studies showed that during the initial stage of adsorption, the
   anions are adsorbed by the adsorbent prior to the metal ions. This
   occurred almost simultaneously with an increase in solution pH. At
   equilibrium, the pH returned towards its initial value. The
   concentration of anion also fluctuated during the entire equilibration

Abstract = {{The presence of the ammonia-oxidising group Nitrosomonas in developing
   biofilms from a subsurface flow dairy effluent treatment wetland was
   investigated using in situ hybridisation and a crude semi-quantitative
   PCR. Fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes. specific for the
   Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosomonas eutropha species, showed that
   nitrifying bacteria were present from the onset of biofilm development
   but that over a five month period the proportions remained low
   (averaging less than 1\% of the total bacterial population). The
   greatest presence of these nitrifiers was found in the second trench of
   the subsurface flow wetland. Nitrosomonas were also found to be
   susceptible to environmental change; adverse environmental conditions,
   such as low temperatures. coincided with negligible Nitrosomonas
   presence throughout the wetland. However. during one period of elevated
   ammonium concentrations Nitrosomonas presence rapidly increased as high
   as 7\% of the total bacterial population. Investigations of relative
   occurrence of effluent bacterial population of Nitrosomonas europaea and
   the biofilm populations showed that Nitrosomonas presence in the
   effluent coincided with significant presence in adjacent biofilms. This
   suggests seeding between both sessile and planktonic populations of this
   species. Nitrosomonas occurred as single cells in biofilms throughout
   the study and were never observed as dense clusters. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The thermal regeneration of field-spent granular-activated carbons (GAC)
   is being increasingly adopted as a cost-effective alternative to
   disposal. The success of this practice requires the adjustment of
   process conditions to maximise the recovery of the original carbon
   characteristics while minimising carbon loss. This paper describes an
   investigation into the regeneration of several field-spent GAC
   representative of those typically generated by the drinking water
   treatment industry. The carbons were initially investigated for their
   ash contents and inorganic compositions in order to determine the
   accumulation of metallic species that affect the regeneration process.
   Regeneration was conducted in steam at 800 degreesC over reaction limes
   between 0 and 60 min in order to achieve different degrees of carbon
   gasification. Weight losses were determined for each condition and the
   resulting carbons characterised for their apparent density. porosity.
   surface area and aqueous adsorption characteristics. Results showed that
   spent carbons recovered most of their adsorption characteristics when
   heated to 800 degreesC under inert conditions. Steam gasification in the
   range of 5 -10 wt\% burn-off had some positive effects on the
   characteristics of the spent carbons which were in most cases
   counteracted by a reduction in the carbon yield. Steam gasification in
   excess of 15 wt\% burn-off caused a rapid increase in the carbon
   mesoporosity but a significant deterioration in the carbon
   microporosity, BET surface area and adsorption capacity for organic
   species of small molecular size. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Dissolved reactive silicon and nitrate were measured at weekly intervals
   over a 3 year period (1991-94) on a 1.2 km reach of a gauged Dorset Mill
   Stream, In addition, dissolved nitrite was measured over a 8 month
   period from the spring to late autumn in 1992, Two intensive studies
   with sampling at 2 h intervals were also completed in low and high
   riverflow conditions. The results were analysed using a mass-balance
   approach with the loss and gains in nutrients dissolved in the water
   expressed in terms of areal rates, Losses of both nutrients occurred
   during periods of low streamflow in spring and summer. Losses of silicon
   are attributed to growth of epilithic diatoms whereas nitrate losses are
   consistent with a number of processes including the growth of aquatic
   plants. the development of epilithic biofilms and nitrogen
   transformations. such as denitrification, in bed-sediments. Stream water
   gained dissolved nitrite during its passage through the section. Silicon
   losses from the stream amounted to between 52 and 63 mmol m(-2) d(-1)
   (expressed per area of bed-sediment) for the spring periods in 1992-94.
   Nitrate losses were more variable with overall rates between 24 and 89
   mmol m(-2) d(-1) for the summer periods in 1991-93. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anaerobic/aerobic batch experiments were conducted with a variety of
   volatile fatty (VFAs) and amino acids on two sequencing batch reactor
   populations displaying enhanced biological phosphorus removal. The batch
   experiments were consistent between the two systems and with the past
   literature: acetic and isovaleric acid were the most efficient
   substrates, and propionic acid was the least efficient of the 2-5 carbon
   VFAs (lack of acclimation was ruled out). A survey of the engineering
   and biochemical literature revealed that both acetic and isovaleric acid
   resulted in a negative reaction redox balance (i.e. it requires reducing
   equivalents such as NADH) during their biotransformation to
   polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), In addition, the survey indicated that
   acetic and isovaleric acid resulted in 3HB rather than 3HV or 3H2MV
   formation. Two possible hypotheses were put forward for evaluation:
   (1)it was hypothesized that a negative intracellular redox balance might
   result in higher PHA content since PHA biosynthesis could be sustained
   under anaerobic conditions (no NADH(2) build up), and,or (2) it was
   hypothesized that 3HB resulted in greater P-uptake than other PHA forms
   such as 3HV. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In order to elucidate and quantify nitrogen transformations occurring
   during aerobic treatment of pig slurry, two laboratory experiments were
   carried out with contrasting levels of aeration, high level (experiment
   1) and low level (experiment 2) of aeration. During these experiments,
   after reaching steady-state conditions, a single pulse of NO3--N-15
   tracer was added directly to the reactor. When nitrification conditions
   were prevailing (experiment 1), no transformation of added NO3--N-15
   occurred (98.7\% N-15-recovery as nitrates in the liquid slurry).
   Moreover, the unlabelled nitrous oxide(N2O) measured (7.4\% of the total
   nitrogen content of the raw slurry) strongly demonstrated that the
   source of N2O emitted was nitrification. During simultaneous
   nitrification and denitrification conditions (experiment 2), the added
   NO3--N-15 was found in gaseous nitrogen forms (N2O-N-15:27\%;
   N-2-N-15:18\%) and in the liquid (TN-N-15:54\%). From this result. it
   was evident that N2O was mainly emitted by denitrification process.
   Using the decrease of the isotopic excess of the NO3--N-15 we calculated
   that 92\% of NO2--N was directly denitrified (as gaseous forms) without
   any previous oxidation to nitrate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A method for evaluating the similarity of replicate benthic diatom
   samples based on the Bray-Curtis similarity measure is described. This
   technique may be useful as part of quality control procedures where
   objective performance measures are required. Levels of similarity >60\%
   typically indicate good agreement between the primary analyst and
   auditor. However. an evaluation of 57 comparisons indicated that
   achievable levels of similarity were dependent upon the species
   diversity of the sample, with samples with high species diversity
   typically having lower levels of similarity than samples with low
   species diversity. Whilst a threshold value of 60\% is adequate for most
   samples, a stiffer threshold of 70\% should be applied to samples with
   very low levels of diversity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Chemical reduction is an alternative technique to remove nitrogen oxides
   from contaminated groundwater and closed-surface water body. Metallic
   iron was employed as a reductant for the reduction of nitrite in water
   in this study. The effect of pH on the rate and products of nitrite
   reduction was investigated with a fixed dosage of metallic iron powder
   (12 mol-Fe/mol-N. size of the powder: 80 mesh). The reduction of nitrite
   by metallic iron was a pseudo-zero-order reaction under the experimental
   conditions. The reduction rate of nitrite was increased with decreasing
   the pH of reaction solution, and the pseudo-zero-order reaction rate
   constants were 180, 130, 60, 15, 10, and 1 mM/h at pH = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
   and 7, respectively. The reduction products of nitrite were nitrogen gas
   and ammonium. The yields of nitrogen gas from nitrite reduction were
   0.63, 0.74, 0.81, 0.87, 0.92. and 0.98 as molar ratios of nitrogen atom
   at pH 2, 3, 4. 5, 6. and 7. respectively. Neutral condition enhanced the

Abstract = {{Laboratory and field tests were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
   of a household filtration process and investigate the effects of
   phosphate and silicate on the removal of arsenic from Bangladesh
   groundwater by ferric hydroxides. Fe/As ratios of greater than 40
   (mg/mg) were required to reduce arsenic to less than 50 mug/L in
   Bangladesh well a ater due to the presence of elevated phosphate and
   silicate concentrations. The household filtration process included
   co-precipitation of arsenic by adding a packet (approximately 2 g) of
   ferric and hypochlorite salts to 20 L of well water and subsequent
   filtration of the water through a bucket sand filter. A field
   demonstration study was performed to test the treatment system in seven
   households in Bangladesh in March and April 2000. Experimental results
   obtained from the participating families proved that the household
   treatment process removed arsenic from approximately 300 mug/L in the
   well water to less than 50 mug/L. The participating families liked this
   simple and affordable process and used it to prepare clean water for
   drinking and cooking. A larger scale field test is currently underway.

Abstract = {{Anaerobic nitrate consumption was accompanied by the accumulation of

   sourer of fixed nitrogen (ammonium), the nitrate-perfused sediments
   exhibited considerably lon er nitrite concentrations than the respective
   control treatments. The simultaneous addition of ammonium and
   chloramphenicol. however, resulted in high nitrite concentrations. This
   suggests that in the absence of chloramphenicol an ammonium-fuelled
   bacterial protein (Ie novo synthesis prevented the accumulation of
   nitrite in the coarse of anaerobic nitrate consumption. Additional DOC
   (glucose, methanol) generally increased the anaerobic nitrate
   consumption rate and the interstitial nitrite concentrations. The
   different scales of these increases were probably related to the

Abstract = {{The natural waters of the Lakes Region in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER)
   show serious problems of chemical quality. The high content of fluoride
   reaches 300 mg l(-1) and affects the health of the population who live
   in this area. Furthermore, the alkaline and sodic characteristics (8 <
   pH < 10 and 0.9 x 10(-4) < Na < 0.35 M l(-1)) of these waters destroy
   the soil for agricultural use. This geochemical study is conducted using
   analytical data issued from literature (UNDP, 1973; Chernet, 1982) and
   several held sampling and laboratory analyses completed during the last
   4 yr. Chemical analyses of 320 samples taken throughout the region have
   been analysed using the computer software AQUA for geostatistic,
   statistic, chemical equilibria and simulation of evaporative
   concentration process. The results show that the waters issuing from
   volcanic rocks are characterised by a positive alkalinity residual of
   calcite. When they concentrate due to the effect of climate, the
   precipitation of calcite causes a decrease in the chemical activity of
   calcium. This results in an increase in solubility of fluoride,
   previously controlled by equilibrium with CaF2, and the element
   concentrates without being significantly affected by the precipitation
   of fluorite. As water concentrates, the low concentration of dissolved
   calcium emphasises the alkaline characteristics. As a consequence, the
   pH reaches very high values (9-10) which make the waters unsuitable for
   agriculture. The: adverse elements, namely fluoride, sodium, and
   alkalinity accumulate in the lower zones of the basins. The acquisition
   of high fluoride content and the alkaline-sodic characteristics depends
   primarily on the unbalanced initial stage between the carbonate
   alkalinity and calcium {[}(HCO3)> 2(Ca + Mg)], which results from the
   weathering and dissolution of the volcanic rocks. The predictive
   qualities of the model AQUA were tested in the context of this region. A
   simulation of the concentration of the waters by evaporation has shown
   chemical variations relatively similar to those obtained with field data
   which include the minor chemical elements such as the fluoride or the
   dissolved silica. For field data, enrichment is more variable and may
   represent localised conditions of mineralization. This model is then
   used to study a method of defluoridation by supplying these waters with
   calcium in the form of gypsum. This method also allows the reduction of
   the alkalinizing and sodifying characteristics of the waters without
   reaching the fluoride standard concentration accepted for drinking
   waters. For drinking purpose, waters of the Ethiopian rift should
   undergo another method of defluoridation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{New methods for spectrophotometric alkalinity measurement, dissolved
   hydrogen monitoring and for obtaining a fingerprint of the microbial
   community were evaluated as tools for process monitoring in anaerobic
   digestion. The anaerobic digestion process was operated at organic
   loading rates of 1.5. 3.0 and 4.5g volatile solids l(-1) d(-1) and
   subjected to pulse loads of carbohydrate, lipid, protein and a mixed
   sludge substrate. The spectrophotometric alkalinity monitoring method
   showed good agreement with traditional titrimetric alkalinity monitoring
   and has the advantage of bring easy to modify to on-line monitoring
   applications. The on-line monitoring of dissolved hydrogen gave valuable
   information about approaching process overload and can be a good
   complement to the conventional monitoring of volatile fatty acids.
   Changing process conditions were also reflected in the microbial
   fingerprint that could be achieved by partitioning in two-phase systems.
   The investigated methods showed potential for application in increasing
   our understanding of the anaerobic digestion process as well as for
   being applicable for monitoring in the complex environment of full-scale
   anaerobic digestion processes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A Pseudomonas luteola strain expressing azoreductase activity was
   utilized to remove the color of an azo dye (reactive red 22) from
   contaminated solutions. The effects of substrate concentrations, medium
   compositions, and operation parameters (e.g., pH, temperature, dissolved
   oxygen, etc.) on decolorization of the azo dye by a P. luteola strain
   were systematically investigated to reveal the key factors that dominate
   the performance of ate-dye decolorization. The metabolites resulting
   from bacterial decolorization were analyzed by high-performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometery (MS). The results show that
   the dissolved oxygen and glucose concentration retarded decolorization
   of reactive red 22 by P. luteola. The optimal ate-dye decolorization
   occurred at 37 degreesC, while more rapid decolorization took place over
   pH 7-9. Yeast extract and tryptone strongly enhanced the decolorization.
   The Michaelis-Menten model can satisfactorily describe the dependence of
   specific decolorization rate on the concentration of substrate (reactive
   red 22 or yeast extract). Decolorization of the azo dye by intact cells
   of P. luteola was essentially independent of the growth phase, whereas
   the azoreductase activity of the cell-free extract decreased in the
   order of late-stationary phase > early-stationary phase > mid-log phase.
   This suggests that mass transfer of the azo dye across the cell membrane
   may be the rate-limiting step. The HPLC and MS analyses suggest that
   both partial reduction and complete cleavage of the ate bond could
   contribute to decolorization of reactive red 22 by P. luteola. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The activity of denitrifying P-accumulating bacteria (DPB) has been
   verified to exist in most WWTPs with biological nutrient removal (BNR).
   The modified UCT process has a high content of DPB. A new BNR process
   with a two-sludge system named A(2)N was especially developed to exploit
   denitrifying dephosphatation. With the identical inflow and effluent
   standards, an existing full-scale UCT-type WWTP and a designed A2N
   process were evaluated by simulation. The used model is based on the
   Delft metabolical model for bio-P removal and ASM2d model for COD and N
   removal. Both processes accommodate denitrifying dephosphatation, but
   the A(2)N process has a more stable performance in N removal. Although
   excess sludge is increased by 6\%, the A(2)N process leads to savings of
   35, 85 and 30\% in aeration energy, mixed liquor internal recirculation
   and land occupation respectively, as compared to the UCT process. Low
   temperature has a negative effect on growth of poly-P bacteria, which
   becomes to especially appear in the A2N process. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The influence of pH and cadmium sulfide on the photocatalytic
   degradation of 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) in titanium dioxide suspensions was
   investigated to evaluate the feasibility of mixed semiconductors on the
   photodegradation of chlorinated organics in aqueous solution. Apparent
   first-order rate constants (k(obs)) and initial rate constants were used
   to evaluate the degradation efficiency of 2-CP. Higher degradation
   efficiency of 2-CP was observed at higher pH values. The apparent
   pseudo-first order rate constant was 0.036 min(-1) at pH 12.5 in TiO2/UV
   system, while a 2- to 9-fold decrease in k(obs) was observed over the pH
   range of 2.59.5. The addition of phosphate buffer solutions at different
   pH values have different effects on the degradation of 2-CP. H2PO4- has
   little effect on the photodegradation of 2-CP, while HPO42- could
   inhibit the photodegradation efficiency of 2-CP. Chlorocatechol,
   hydroquinone, benzoquinone and phenol were identified as the predominant
   aromatic intermediates for the photocatalytic degradation of 2-CP.
   Moreover, less aromatic intermediates at higher pH were observed. Direct
   oxidation contributed significantly to the photodegradation of 2-CP. An
   addition of a semiconductor decreased the initial and apparent
   first-order rate constants of 2-CP. The cutoff of wavelength of 320 nm
   could diminish the contribution of direct photolysis of 2-CP. The
   combination of cadmium sulfide and titanium dioxide can lead to an
   enhanced rate of disappearance of 2-CP compared to those in single
   semiconductor system. A 1.2 to 2.5-fold increase in rate constant in
   coupled semiconductor system relative to the single semiconductor system
   was obtained. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report a comparative study using three different chemometric
   techniques to evaluate both spatial and temporal changes in Suquia River
   water quality, with a special emphasis on the improvement obtained using
   discriminant analysis for such evaluation. We have monitored 22
   parameters at different stations from the upper, middle, and beginning
   of the lower river basin during at least two years including 232
   different samples. We obtained a complex data matrix, which was treated
   using the pattern recognition techniques of cluster analysis (CA),
   factor analysis/principal components (FA/PCA). and discriminant analysis
   (DA). CA renders good results as a first exploratory method to evaluate
   both spatial and temporal differences, however it fails to show details
   of these differences. FA/PCA needs 13 parameters to point out 71\% of
   both temporal and spatial changes; consequently data reduction from
   FA/PCA in this case is not as considerable as expected. However, FA/PCA
   allows to group the selected parameters according to common features as
   well as to evaluate the incidence of each group on the overall change in
   water quality, specially during the analysis of temporal changes. DA
   technique shows the best results for data reduction and pattern
   recognition during both temporal and spatial analysis. DA renders an
   important data reduction using 6 parameters to afford 87\% right
   assignations during temporal analysis. Besides, it uses only 5
   parameters to yield 75\% right assignations during the spatial analysis
   of four different basin areas. DA allowed us to greatly reduce the
   dimensionality of the starting data matrix, pointing out to a few
   parameters that indicate the biggest changes in water quality as well as
   variation patterns associated with seasonal variations, urban run-off,
   and pollution sources, presenting a novel approach for water quality
   assessments. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of upstream coagulant dosing for full-flow microfiltration of
   an upland-reservoir water has been investigated. The process, run under
   conditions of constant flux and pH and based on a ferric salt, is
   compared with a published study of another full-flow process based on
   alum dosing and operated at constant pressure and coagulant
   concentration. The current study includes data for the residual deposit
   remaining following backflushing by reverse flow. Results are presented
   in terms of the specific-cake resistance (R-c', m(-2)) as a function of
   pH or coagulant dose. Reasonable correlation with classical cake
   filtration theory was obtained, such that R-c' was assumed to be
   independent of run time and cake thickness. The following trends have
   been noted: The optimum pH for the alum-based system appears to be
   between 7.5 and 8 on the basis of cake resistance. The effect of
   coagulant dose between 18 and 71 muM Fe3+ is much more significant than
   a change in pH between 5 and 9 for the alum system: a 53-fold increase
   in specific Aux compared with a 7-fold increase with reference to the
   limiting R-c' values at pH 4.8 and 7.7. A low coagulant dose (0.018mM,
   1.0 mgl(-1) Fe3+) appears to have a slightly detrimental effect on
   downstream microfiltration operation. The low coagulant doses apparently
   cause incomplete aggregation of colloidal particles such that internal
   fouling of the membrane takes place. The residual (cleaning cycle)
   deposit resistance followed roughly the same trend as the backflush
   cycle cake resistance with coagulant concentration, but with a much
   reduced value (about 16 times lower, on average). An optimum coagulant
   dose of 0.055 mM (3.1 mg/l) Fe3+ can be identified on the basis of
   operational cost based on coagulant cost and cake resistance, all other
   aspects of the system being substantially unchanged. It is concluded
   that coagulation with downstream microfiltration offers a cost-effective
   means of removing natural organic matter, achieving a THMFP removal of
   around 80\% at the optimum dose. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The toxicity of mercury, copper, cadmium and chromium on sperm
   viability, fertilisation, embryogenesis and larval attachment of Ciona

   decrease even at the highest metal concentration tested. The median
   effective concentrations (EC50) reducing rates of embryogenesis and
   larval attachment by 50\% were 54 mug Hg/l (0.27 muM), 46 mug Cu/l (0.72
   mug), 838 mug Cd/l (7.46 muM), 10,318 mug Cr/l (198 muM), and 35 mug
   Hg/l (0.18 muM), 34 yg Cu/l (0.54 muM) and 11,755 mug Cr/l (226 muM).
   respectively. Therefore, Hg is three times more toxic than Cu ton a
   molar basis), ca. 30 times more toxic than Cd and ca. 1000 times more
   toxic than Cr to early stages of C. intestinalis. Rates of larval
   attachment and embryogenesis were the most sensitive endpoints, although
   the latter is more advisable for routine assessment of seawater quality
   because of its greater simplicity. In addition to bivalves and
   sea-urchins, ascidian embryos can provide biological criteria for
   seawater quality standards taking into account the sensitivity of a
   chordate and contributing to the detection of harmful chemicals with no
   marked effect on the species currently in use in seawater quality

Abstract = {{The integrated Monod and Haldane models were used to evaluate the
   kinetic coefficients and their standard deviations using the methane
   accumulation curves of low-temperature acetoclastic methanogenesis. The
   linear and exponential approximations and the limitations of their
   applicability were deduced from the integrated models. The samples of
   lake sediments and biomass taken from a low-temperature upflow anaerobic
   sludge blanket (UASB) reactor were used as inoculum in batch assays for
   acetate: methanation. In comparison, the Monod and Haldane models were
   applied to evaluate the kinetic coefficients for mesophilic acetoclastic
   methanogenesis accomplished by the pure culture of Methanosarcina
   barkeri strain MS. The Monod and Haldane models and their approximations
   were fitted by using non-linear regression. For the wide range of
   initial acetate concentrations (4.2-84 mM; 5-100 mM) applied to the UASB
   biomass at 11 and 22 degreesC and for the lake sediment samples at 6 and
   15 degreesC, a better ft was obtained with the Haldane models and their
   exponential approximations, respectively. For the lake sediments the
   values of inhibition coefficients decreased at decreasing temperatures.
   At the highest temperature of 30 degreesC no difference was found
   between the Haldane and Monod models and the simpler Monod model should
   be preferred. The values of the maximum growth rate of biomass were
   highest at 30 degreesC (lake sediment) and 22 degreesC (the UASB
   biomass) being in a range presented in the literature for mesophilic
   acetoclastic methanogenesis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   activated carbon (GAC) filters was evaluated in order to improve the
   understanding of the nitrification process in drinking water treatment.
   The study was conducted in a northern climate where very cold water
   temperatures (below 2 degreesC) prevail for extended periods and rapid
   shifts of temperature are frequent in the spring and fall. Ammonia
   removals were monitored and the fixed nitrifying biomass was measured
   using a method of potential nitrifying activity. The impact of
   temperature was evaluated on two different filter media: an opened
   superstructure wood-based activated carbon and a closed superstructure
   activated carbon-based on bituminous coal. The study was conducted at
   two levels: pilot scale (first stage filters) and full-scale
   (second-stage filters) and the results indicate a strong temperature
   impact on nitrification activity. Ammonia removal capacities ranged from
   40 to 90\% in pilot filters, at temperatures above 10 degreesC, while
   more than 90\% ammonia was removed in the full-scale filters for the
   same temperature range. At moderate temperatures (4-10 degreesC), the
   first stage pilot filters removed 10-40\% of incoming ammonia for both
   media (opened and closed superstructure). In the full-scale filters. a
   difference between the two media in nitrification performances was
   observed at moderate temperatures: the ammonia removal rate in the
   opened superstructure support (more than 90\%) was higher than in the
   closed superstructure support (45\%). At low temperatures (below 4
   degreesC) both media performed poorly. Ammonia removal capacities were
   below 30\% in both pilot- and full-scale filters. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Landfill leachate is a complex wastewater which the composition and
   concentration of contaminants are influenced by the type of waste
   deposited and the age of landfill. In the last years, several processes
   or process combinations were developed and tested to reach requirements
   for the discharge of leachate. Among the new processes, membrane
   processes are considered as promising: reverse osmosis is one of the
   most widely used treatment in the Northwestern European countries and
   nanofiltration is gained in popularity during the last 5 years.
   Successful application of membrane technology for the treatment of
   landfill leachates, requires efficient control of membrane fouling. Two
   organic membranes of nanofiltration were used for pilot-scale testing.
   Leachates were subject to several pretreatments (pH modification,
   prefiltration and coagulation with FeCl3) to remove potential foulants
   including dissolved organic and inorganic substances, colloidal and
   suspended particles. These pretreatments do not enhance the performances
   (retention and permeation flux) of membranes because the pH range and
   the presence of Fe3+ ions contribute greatly to change the
   characteristics of organic matter and the surface charges of membranes.
   However, the results show that nanofiltration is sufficient to eliminate
   refractory GOD. the permeates have a COD lower than the requirements for
   discharge. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Characterisation of a range of Victorian low-rank coal (VLRC) based and
   commercial adsorbents under continuous flow conditions was conducted in
   down flow fixed-bed columns. The effect of bed depth, hydraulic loading
   and initial concentration of the adsorbate 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) was
   studied. Prediction of the performance of the columns using
   bed-depth/service time analysis showed good agreement with the
   experimental results. The VLRC-based activated carbons gave lower
   service times for removal of 4-NP compared with the coconut-based
   commercial activated carbon Picactif. However, they showed comparable
   efficiency in terms of bed volumes treated and carbon usage rate (CUR).
   The VLRC-activated power station char (APSC) showed the low est CUR of
   0.57 g/L in comparison with 0.62 and 3.61 g/L exhibited by the
   commercial carbons Picactif and Hydraffin, respectively. The power
   station char (PSC) and Auschar gave poor CUR of 11.23 and 75.36 g/L,
   respectively. Three adsorbents H ere evaluated for the removal of
   natural organic matter (NOM) from aqueous solution. The breakthrough
   behaviour indicated that the pore size distribution of the adsorbents is
   an important physical characteristic for the adsorption of the NOM.
   There was a non-adsorbable fraction of the NOM that was a function of
   the type of adsorbent. In the presence of NOM, Picactif gave longer
   service time for the removal of 4-NP compared with APSC, consistent with
   the trend obtained in the absence of NOM. However, lower breakthrough
   times (at 10\% C-0) of 44 and 47\% were obtained for APSC and Picactif,
   respectively. Further removal (35\%) of 4-NP was achieved over extended
   operation of the beds, however more frequent backwashing was required as
   a result of the biological growth exhibited in the presence of NOM. (C)

   control strategies. The rate of B. subtilis inactivation with ozone was
   independent of pn. decreased with temperature (activation energy of

   was found to be a good indicator for C. poruum at 20 30 degreesC, but at
   lower temperatures R. subtilis was inactivated more readily than C.
   parvum. Bromate formation increased as both pH and temperature
   increased. For water with an initial bromide concentration of 33 mu

Abstract = {{This laboratory study evaluated the effects of temperature and aerial
   exposure on BOD5 (5-day BOD) of waste zebra mussels of the type
   generated by maintenance operations on dams and navigational locks. The
   term waste zebra mussels includes the mussels and their associated
   debris with the latter including sediment, feces, pseudofeces and other
   small aquatic organisms. The BOD, of waste zebra mussel was evaluated
   after aerial exposure of 3 and 10 days at temperatures of 5, 10, and 10
   C. The mean BOD5 values for waste zebra mussels in this study ranged
   from 18,500 to 30,600mg O-2/l. Factorial ANOVA analysis revealed that
   both temperature and aerial exposure had a negative effect on waste
   zebra mussel BOD5 (P < 0.05) but there was no significant interaction
   effect (P = 0.119). Multiple regression analysis predicted that for the
   range of treatment conditions used in this study each I C increase in
   temperature reduced the waste zebra mussel BOD5 by 284 mg O-2/l or
   0.93\%; of the maximum mean BOD5. Each 1 day increase in aerial exposure
   reduced waste zebra mussel BOD5 by 987 mg O-2/l or 3.22\% of the maximum
   mean BOD5. Aerial exposure of waste zebra mussels substantially reduces
   waste BOD5. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   slow removal of stearic acid occurred. Oleic acid concentrations above
   30 mg I inhibited acetate degradation but stearic acid up to 100 mg l(1)
   did not inhibit aceticlastic methanogenesis. Hydrogenotrophic

   suspended solids. Although only 1\% copper was found to leave the held,
   this was sufficient to cause high copper concentrations (average 2102
   +/- 433 mug/L total copper and 189 +/- 139 mug L dissolved copper) in
   the runoff. Copper concentrations in groundwater samples were also high
   (average 312 +/- 198 mug L total copper and 216 +/- 99 mug/L dissolved
   copper). Sedimentation, a best management practice for reducing copper
   loadings. was found to reduce the total copper concentrations in runoff
   by 90\% to a concentration of 245 +/- 127 mug/L L; however, dissolved
   copper concentrations remained stable, averaging 139 +/- 55 mug L. Total
   copper concentrations were significantly reduced by the effective

Abstract = {{Instantaneous improvement of the settling of bulking filamentous
   activated sludge can be achieved by the addition of a polymer or a large
   amount (up to 100\% of the MLSS concentration) of talc powder to the
   sludge. Long-term improvement relies on repeated additions, as these
   additives have no adverse effects on the causative filaments. A
   multi-component additive was compared to the traditional additives in
   lab-scale activated sludge units using three highly filamentous sludges
   from different industrial treatment plants. The study demonstrated that
   the multi-component additive was superior to the traditional remedies.
   It was shown that, in the case of severe filamentous bulking, a single
   addition of the neu additive immediately improved sludge settling and
   exerted a destructive effect on the causative filamentous bacteria.
   Thus. the latter additive also ensured a long-term sludge sedimentation
   improvement. The traditional additives exhibited an immediate and
   short-term effect. The node additive also retarded sludge rising due to
   denitrification and it improved sludge dewaterability. The study
   revealed Nostocoidal limicola II, with slightly hydrophobic cell wall,
   to be somewhat resistant to the quaternary ammonium salt present as
   biocide in the additive. (C) 1001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Water quality was measured in 42 streams in the Colebrooke and Upper
   Bann catchments in Northern Ireland over the period 1990-1998. Despite
   ongoing. pollution control measures. biological water quality, as
   determined by the invertebrate average score per taxon (ASPT) index, did
   not improve and there was no appreciable decline in recorded farm
   pollution incidents. However, the lack of decline in pollution incidents
   could reflect changes in detection policy, as a greater proportion of
   incidents were recorded from less polluting discharges such as farm-yard
   runoff. In contrast, there was an improvement during 1997 and 1998 in
   annual chemical water quality classification based on exceedence values
   (90th percentiles) for dissolved oxygen, ammonium and BOD c
   oncentrations. In 1998, 11.9\% of streams were severely polluted
   compared to 26.2\% in 1990. while the proportion classed as of salmonid
   water quality, increased from 40.5\% in 1990 to 59.6\% in 1998. Although
   water quality in 1996 did not improve relative to 1990 values, there was
   a notable increasing trend from 1990 in the numbers of samples taken
   during the summer which had good water quality with low ammonium ( < 0.6
   mg N l (1)) and high dissolved oxygen ( > 70\% sat). The trend for
   samples with low BOD ( <4 mg I (1)) was more erratic, but an improvement
   was apparent from 1994. These improvements in chemical water quality
   suggest that point-source farm pollution declined after 1990. The fact
   that this was not reflected in stream biology may reflect the limited
   time scale for biological recovery. An important factor preventing
   biological recovery may be the high pollution capacity of manures and
   silage effluent, so that even reduced numbers of farm pollution
   incidents can severely perturb stream ecosystems. The intractable nature
   of farm pollution suggests that there is a need to consider an
   interactive approach to problem resolution involving both farmers and
   regulators. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ethanol-blended gasoline has been used in Brazil for 20 years and,
   probably, is going to be more widely used in North America due to the
   MtBE environmental effects on groundwater. The potential impacts caused
   by the presence of ethanol in UST spills are related to the co-solvency
   effect and the preferential degradation of ethanol over the BTEX
   compounds. These interactions may increase the length of dissolved
   hydrocarbon plumes and the costs associated with site remediation. This
   study investigates the advantages of phytoremediation to overcome the
   problems associated with the presence of ethanol in groundwater
   contaminanted with gasoline-ethanol mixtures. Experiments were performed
   under lab conditions with cuttings of Willow tree (Salix babylonica)
   cultivated hydroponically. Results showed that the cuttings were able to
   reduce ethanol and benzene concentrations by more than 99\% in less than
   a week. The uptake of both contaminants was confirmed by blank controls
   and was significantly related to cuttings transpiration capacity.
   Sorption onto roots biomass also markedly affected the behavior of
   contaminants in solution. Experiments to evaluate plants' toxicity to
   ethanol indicated that plants were only affected when aqueous ethanol
   concentration reached 2000 mg l(-1). Results suggest that
   phytoremediation can be a good complement to intrinsic remediation in
   shallow aquifer sites contaminated with ethanol-blended gasoline spills.

Abstract = {{Ferric chloride and lime conditioning of sewage sludge is usually
   interpreted in terms of enhanced aggregation of sludge components. In
   this study, transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the
   conditioning mechanism at a submicronic scale. Samples were collected
   from two municipal wastewater treatment plants at different stages of
   the process. embedded in an epoxy resin, and sectioned with an
   ultramicrotome. Transmission electron microscopy examination of thin
   sections revealed that clumps of crystalloids develop on external
   surfaces of flocs after the application of both conditioners. This
   precipitate creates a rigid structure around the flocs which, upon
   mechanical dewatering. transmits the stresses applied to the inner parts
   of flues. The porous structure of the precipitate may also participate
   to the withdrawal of water as a draining media. Energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy revealed that Fe, P, and Ca are the dominant elements in
   the precipitate with Fe/P and Fe/Ca elemental ratios close to 2.8-3 and
   1.1-3, respectively. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sediment of Ya-Er Lake had been heavily polluted by polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) from the former
   chloralkali industry. The total amounts of PCDD/Fs and I-TEQ decreased
   along the water flow direction and also decreased from top to bottom
   layers of sediment cores. Sediment of Pond 1 was dominated by PCDF,
   especially TCDF. In contrast, in the other four ponds, PCDD dominated in
   all layers and octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) predominated in
   all of the homologues. When homologue profiles from sediments and water
   samples were compared using principal component analysis (PCA), the
   first two principal components represented 95.2\% of the variance in the
   data. The first component explained 75.9\% of the variance and the
   second one 19.3\%. Two clusters were most distinct, presenting a shift
   in PCDD/Fs composition from PCDF to heptachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin
   (HpCDD) and OCDD in sediments and water from Pond I to Ponds 2-5. The
   pattern variation between Pond 1 and Ponds 2-5 in Ya-Er Lake was most
   likely due to the change of process in the chemical plant after the dams
   between the ponds were built. The results of the present study also
   showed that log K-oc of PCDD/Fs calculated from data of sediment and
   water in the field were comparable with theoretical log K-oc. The
   results also implied that the concentrations of PCDD/Fs in water and
   sediments could be predicted from each other by log K-oc. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Perchlorate (ClO4-) has been detected in numerous ground and surface
   waters. and has recently been added to the drinking water Candidate
   Contaminant List in the United States. Perchlorate can be removed from
   drinking water using ion exchange, but this results in the production of
   highly saline (7-12\%) perchlorate-contaminated brines.
   Perchlorate-degrading microbial enrichments capable of growth in highly
   saline water were obtained by screening six salt water environments
   including marine and lake surface waters, salt marshes, subtidal
   sediments. and 3 biofilm/sludge from a seawater filter. Perchlorate
   reduction was obtained in three of these samples (seawater, saline lake
   water, and biofilm/sludge) at a salinity of 3\%. The salinity range of
   two of these cultures was extended through serial transfers into media
   having higher salt concentrations (3-7\%). Growth rates were measured
   over 3 salinity range of 1-15\%. The maximum growth rate measured for
   the saline lake-water enrichment was 0.0060 +/- 0.003 d(-1) (doubling
   time of 11.6 +/- 0.8 d) at a salinity of 5\%. Growth rates decreased to
   0.037 +/- 0.002 d(-1) at a salinity of 11\%, and no growth was observed
   at salinities of 13 or 15\%. These results demonstrate for the first
   time that biological perchlorate reduction is possible in solutions
   having a salinity typical of ion exchange brines. (C) 2001 Elsevier

   Mg(x)Fe(y)(OH)(2(x+y)) (CO(3)(2-))(y/2). mH(2)O; anionic clay: one of

   column experiments. The Pb-removal property of the compound was
   evaluated as a function of concentration of Pb in the treated solution,
   space Velocity (Sv) of the solution in the column packed with the
   compound, pH of the solution and contaminated humic substance. The
   compound showed a highly effective Pb-removal property that was
   comparable to the other conventional adsorbents. The Pb was removed
   rapidly by the column packed with the compound over the wide range of
   the Sv. The buffering pH function of the compound contributed to the Pb
   removal producing weak-alkali atmosphere. The contamination of humic
   substance in the treated solution reduced the Pb removal largely
   depending on its amount. The effectiveness of the compound for the rapid
   Pb removal was confirmed through a series of experiments. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The effects of the xenoestrogens ethinyrestradiol (EE) and bisphenol A
   (BPA) on the survival and reproductive behaviour of the amphipod
   Gammarus pulex were determined in a series of bioassays. Acute toxicity
   of the test chemicals was determined under static conditions, revealing
   10d median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of 0.84 and 1.49mg/L for EE and
   BPA, respectively. Several aspects of the reproductive behaviour
   including the ability of males and females to detect each other, form
   precopulatory guarding pairs and to continue the guarding behaviour,
   were examined during a 24 h exposure period over a wide range of
   concentrations. However, reproductive behaviour was only disrupted at
   relatively high concentrations where it would be unrealistic to
   attribute the effects to an endocrine mediated process. Consequently,
   changes in precopulatory guarding resulting from acute exposure, do not
   seem to be suitable For detecting the presence in water of xenoestrogens
   known to cause endocrine disruption in vertebrates. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Runoff water quality from a peat mine was studied during 1995 and 1996
   in Central Finland. Water samples from three drained sub-catchments and
   groundwater were analysed for all the standard physio-chemical
   parametres including different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus. The
   annual leaching of phosphorus, nitrogen and suspended solids was
   estimated to be 16-38 kg km(-2), 1073-1500 kg km(-2), and 2-8 t km(-2),
   respectively. The variation in nutrient concentrations could be best
   explained by the relative volumes of new water (5-day sum of rainfall),
   ditchwater temperature and conductivity. Heavy rainfall caused new water
   to infiltrate washing nitrate out of the unsaturated peal layer
   resulting in high concentrations in ground- and ditchwater. Ditchwater
   phosphorus concentrations always decreased with increased runoff and
   peaked, as did COD and colour, after dry spells when old groundwater
   dominated runoff. A large part of the suspended solids load occurred
   during snowmelt, whereas disserved solids and nitrogen loads peaked
   during summer flows. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated system has been developed to remediate soils contaminated
   with pentachlorophenol (PCP) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAI-Is). This system involves the coupling of two treatment
   technologies, soil-solvent washing and anaerobic biotreatment of the
   extract. Specifically, this study evaluated the effectiveness of a
   granular activated carbon (GAC) fluidized-bed reactor to treat a
   synthetic-waste stream of PCP and four PAHs (naphthalene, acenaphthene,
   pyrene, and benzo(b)fluoranthene) under anaerobic conditions. This waste
   stream was intended to simulate the wash fluids from a soil washing
   process treating soils from a wood-preserving site. The reactor achieved
   a removal efficiency of greater than 99.8\% for PCP with conversion to
   its dechlorination intermediates averaging 46.5\%. Effluent, carbon
   extraction, and isotherm data also indicate that naphthalene and
   acenaphthene were removed from the liquid phase with efficiencies of 86
   and 93\%, respectively. Effluent levels of pyrene and
   benzo(b)fluoranthene were extremely low due to the high-adsorptive
   capacity of GAC for these compounds. Experimental evidence does not
   suggest that the latter two compounds were biochemically transformed
   within the reactor. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{For Odzi, the main river originating in the Eastern Highlands of
   Zimbabwe, the nature, sources and extent of pollution are characterised.
   Over a span of 9 months, the river water samples collected at six
   selected sites were analysed for Various physical and chemical
   parameters namely, temperature, conductance, pH, total suspended and
   dissolved solids, BOD, total phosphate and nitrate levels. The Mutare
   river carried the seepage from abandoned mine dumps to the Odzi River.
   Water quality of the Odzi River at different points assessed by the
   water quality indices (WQI) is compared. According to the quality
   indices during the study period, water quality in the upper reaches of
   the river was medium to good. It dwindled in the plains, due to the
   seepage from abandoned mine dumps and discharges from the farm lands.

   flocculation would yield a significant sedimentation effect at the first

   centrifugal-filtration models, the most significant moisture-removal
   stages included filtrate to flow through a wet cake. Moreover, an
   optimal rotational speed exists at which the moisture-removal rate

Abstract = {{Systematic studies on metal ion adsorption equilibrium and kinetics by a
   commercial H-type granular activated carbon were carried out. Titration
   of the carbon showed that the surface charge density decreased with an
   increasing pH. Higher copper adsorption was obtained with increasing
   solution pH and ionic strength. Metal removal was in the descending
   order: Cu2+ > Zn2+ approximate to Co2+. Copper removal was not affected
   by addition of zinc or cobalt, while copper can reduce both zinc and
   cobalt removal. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that the copper
   adsorption rapidly occurred in the first 30-60 min and reached the
   complete removal in 3-5 h. Removal of zinc and cobalt was slightly
   slower than that of copper. It was found that the mass transfer is
   important in the metal adsorption rate. The surface complex formation
   model was used successfully to describe the surface change density, as
   well as the single- and multi-species metal adsorption equilibrium. The
   copper removal was due to adsorption of Cu2+, CuOH+, and CuCl+, while
   the zinc and cobalt uptake was due to the formation of surface-metal
   complexes of SOM2+ and SOMOH+ (M = Zn and Co). It was found that the
   diffusion-control model well described the adsorption kinetics with
   various metal ions and pH values. Finally sensitivity analysis on the
   kinetic model's parameters was carried out. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The role of different functional groups present in humic substances on
   the membrane flux is unclear. This study is undertaken to (1) separate
   the carboxyl and phenolic groups from a humic solution, and (2) evaluate
   the effect of each fractionated humic substances on the ultrafiltration
   (UF) performance. A weak-base amine resin was used for the adsorption
   (pH 7) and the subsequent desorption (pH 13) of the phenolic groups from
   a commercial humic solution. These fractions were evaluated
   qualitatively (via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and
   quantitatively (titration); they were further subjected to the analyses
   of the trihalomethane formation potential (THMFP) and ultrafiltration
   performance. Although, a complete separation of the phenolic and
   carboxyl groups is not possible, the results nevertheless provide useful
   information about their effects on UF performance. The fraction with a
   higher content of the phenolic OH group exhibits the highest THMFP (190
   mug/mg C), whereas the fraction with a higher content of the carboxyl
   groups exhibits more flux decline. The UF system evaluated is unable to
   remove a significant portion of THM precursors, resulting in high THMs
   in permeate. The use of powdered activated carbon for the pretreatment
   of these fractions fails to improve membrane fouling. The pore size of
   UF membrane does not appear to affect the membrane flux, and the switch
   from the hydrophobic to hydrophilic membrane only slight improves the
   permeate flux. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An anaerobic-aerobic system including simultaneous methanogenesis and
   denitrification was introduced to treat organic and nitrogen compounds
   in immature leachate from a landfill site. Denitrification and
   methanogenesis were successfully carried out in the anaerobic reactor
   while the organic removal and nitrification of NH4+-N were carried out
   in the aerobic reactor when rich organic substrate was supplied with
   appropriate hydraulic retention time. The maximum organic removal rate
   was 15.2 kg COD/m(3) d in the anaerobic reactor while the maximum NH4+-N
   removal rate and maximum nitrification rate were 0.84 kg NH4+-N/m(3)/d
   and 0.50 kg NO3--N/m(3)/d, respectively, in the aerobic reactor. The pH
   range for proper nitrification was 6-8.8 in the aerobic reactor. The
   organic compounds inhibited nitrification so that the organic removal in
   the anaerobic reactor could enhance the nitrification rate in the
   following aerobic reactor. The gas production rate was 0.33 m(3)/kg COD
   and the biogas compositions of CH4, CO2, and N-2 were kept relatively
   constant, 66-75, 22-32, and 2-3\%, respectively. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The transient movement of pesticides at biologically active
   concentrations during storm events is considered to be a cause of
   biological impoverishment in some headwater streams. The programme of
   work described sought to identify compounds that are the cause of toxic
   effects during such events. Along with targeted pesticide analysis,
   toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) procedures were used to
   identify compounds with a demonstrated toxic effect. These procedures
   were specifically directed towards isolating and attributing toxicity to
   classes of organic contaminants in samples collected from an English
   headwater stream during a storm event. The organic load was isolated by
   means of solid-phase extraction (SPE). Bioassay of the SPE extract at x
   100 whole water concentrations confirmed that the samples contained
   substances toxic to Daphnia magna, although the raw samples were not
   toxic. Targeted pesticide analysis identified simazine and diuron as the
   major pesticides present and, using a toxicity unit (TU) approach, were
   shown to be responsible for a significant amount of the observed
   concentrate toxicity during a runoff event. However, they were not
   present in sufficient quantities to be totally responsible for a more
   toxic later event. By simplification of the SPE isolate using
   reverse-phase HPLC, fractions from which were tested for toxicity, the
   cause of concentrate toxicity in the later event was isolated to two
   discrete fractions. GC-MS analysis of these fractions identified
   nonylphenol, endosulfan sulphate and pendimethalin as present, with the
   majority of toxicity attributed to nonylphenol (NP). The main advantage
   of the TIE approach is that it allows biological active compounds with a
   demonstrated effect to be identified that may not be selected by more
   traditional techniques. Crown Copyright (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This article presents the amounts of heavy metals bound to the sediment
   matrices (carbonates, Fe-oxides, Mn-oxides, and organic matter), the
   correlations between any two heavy-metal binding fractions, and the
   correlations between sediment matrices and their heavy-metal binding
   fractions. Data consisted of 313 sets obtained from five main rivers
   (located in southern Taiwan) were analyzed by statistical methods. Among
   six heavy metals analyzed (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni, Cr, and Co), the statistical
   results show that Zn is primarily bound to organic matter, and Cr is
   primarily bound to Fe-oxides. Principal component analysis (PCA) and
   correlation analysis (CA) result in significant correlations between
   carbonates bound Ni and carbonates bound Cr, Fe-oxides bound Ni and
   Fe-oxides bound Cr, and Mn-oxides bound Cu and Mn-oxides bound Cr. From
   linear regression results, the levels of the six heavy metals bound to
   either organic matter or Fe-oxides is moderately dependent on the
   contents of organic matter or Fe-oxides, especially true for Cr and Pb.
   According to slope values of linear regression, Cu and Cr have the
   highest specific binding amounts (SBA) to organic matter and Fe-oxides,
   respectively. A significant correlation between organic matter and
   organically bound heavy metals implied that organic matter contained in
   the sediments of the Potzu river and the Yenshui river can be adequately
   used as a normalizing agent. However, the six heavy metals bound to
   either carbonates or Mn-oxides do not correlate with carbonates or
   Mn-oxides. The obtained results also imply that competitions of various
   sediment phases in association with heavy metals occur, and organic
   matter and Fe-oxides are more accessible to heavy metals than other
   sediment phases. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an experimental approach of aggregation in natural
   suspensions is presented. The suspensions are organic-matter-rich waters
   sampled in a brook which drains peat areas. The aggregation was
   conducted on raw samples in three different experiments lasting from 2
   to 8 days. The particle size distribution (PSD) in the 0.5-10 mum size
   range was followed with a laser sizer and appeared to be almost constant
   along the whole experiment duration. Nevertheless, the volume of
   particles larger than 10 mum increased steadily, showing that
   aggregation occured. This appeared to be the consequence of a steady
   state aggregation which allowed the removal of the whole particle set
   within a day. The use of an aggregation model adapted to calculations on
   PSD allowed estimation of the aggregation efficiency for such
   suspensions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An attached growth bioreactor was designed to minimize the effect of
   suspended microorganisms on membrane fouling in submerged membrane
   bioreactor. Comparison of mixed liquor from attached and suspended
   growth systems was made to elucidate major factors giving rise to
   different filtration characteristics. Unexpectedly, the rate of membrane
   fouling of the attached growth system was about 7 times higher than that
   of the suspended growth system despite similar characteristics of
   soluble fraction from the two reactors. Filtration performance proved to
   depend on the concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS).
   Better filtration performance with suspended growth was explained by the
   formation of dynamic membranes with suspended solids. A series of
   analyses such as hydraulic resistance, specific cake resistance,
   scanning electron microscope, and atomic force microscope were carried
   out to elucidate the different filtration characteristics of the two
   systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of a temperature increase from 55 to 65 degreesC on process
   performance and microbial population dynamics were investigated in
   thermophilic, lab-scale, continuously stirred tank reactors. The
   reactors had a working volume of 3 l and were fed with cattle manure at
   an organic loading rate of 3 g VS/l reactor volume/d. The hydraulic
   retention time in the reactors was 15 days. A stable reactor performance
   was obtained for periods of three retention times both at 55 degreesC
   and 65 degreesC. At 65 degreesC methane yield stabilized at
   approximately 165 ml/g VS/d compared to 200 ml/g VS/d at 55 degreesC.
   Simultaneously, Ibe level of total volatile fatty acids, VFA, increased
   from being below 0.3g/l to 1.8-2.4g acetate/l. The specific methanogenic
   activities (SMA) of biomass from the reactors were measured with
   acetate, propionate, butyrate, hydrogen, formate and glucose. At 65
   degreesC, a decreased activity was found For glucosc-, acetate-,
   butyrate- and formate-utilizers and no significant activity was measured
   with propionate. Only the hydrogen-consuming methanogens showed an
   enhanced activity at 65 degreesC. Numbers of cultivable methanogens,
   estimated by the most probable number (MPN) method, were significantly
   lower on glucose, acetate and butyrate at the increased operational
   temperature, while the numbers of hydrogenotrophic methanogens remained
   unchanged. No viable propionate-degrading bacteria were enriched at 65
   degreesC. Use of ribosomal oligonucleotide probes showed that an
   increase in temperature resulted in a decreased contribution of the rRNA
   of the domain bacteria from 74-79 to 57-62\% of the universal probe,
   while the rRNA of the domain archaea, increased from 18-23 to 34-36\%.

Abstract = {{A typical insoluble chlorinated aromatic dye (CAD), disperse red (DR),
   was used to explore the reaction mechanism and kinetics of
   photodegradation in non-ionic surfactant solutions. The use of an
   additional hydrogen source and photosensitizer is also studied to
   improve the decay rates. The decay rate of dye in surfactants depends on
   the K, of surfactants and their ability to offering an effective
   hydrogen source. The photodegradation of CAD can be divided into three
   stages: the initial lag stage, the fast degradation stage and the final
   retardation stage. The lag stage will vanish and the decay rates of dye
   can be greatly improved by 2.5-3.6 times after adding an additional
   hydrogen source (NaBH4) or photosensitizer (acetone) to the surfactant
   micellar solution. However, the use of an additional hydrogen Source or
   photosensitizer has dosage limitations in such applications. The
   photoreduction of DR is the main reaction mechanism, in which
   photodechlorination is observed first with the generation of HCl as the
   final product, then followed by photodecolorization by breaking the azo
   bond of the chromophore. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   solution diffusion model is derived for contaminant removal during
   nanofiltration (NF) of ground and surface water. Solute permeation and
   back-diffusion coefficients were used as fitting parameters to model
   rejection characteristics of four thin-film composite NF membranes under
   conditions typical of drinking water NF. Nonlinear fits of the model to
   experimental data suggests that the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency's (USEPA)'s Information Collection Rule protocol for
   bench-scale studies could be improved to obtain greater precision of the
   mass transfer coefficients. The model was found to fit rejection data
   for several water treatment contaminants including total organic carbon,
   precursors to total organic halide, four trihalomethanes and nine
   haloacetic acids containing chlorine and bromine, calcium and total
   hardness, alkalinity and conductivity. The simplified approach to mass
   transfer calculations from multi-solute systems suggests that feed water
   recovery has a stronger influence on contaminant rejection than permeate
   flux. Evidence for coupled transport of divalent inorganic ions is also
   presented. Even though the model developed does not account for ion
   coupling and cannot be applied in a purely predictive mode, it can
   assist in the better design and interpretation of data obtained from
   site-specific pilot-scale water treatment NF studies conducted in
   support of giant design. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An electronic nose consisting of 12 metal oxide sensors was used to
   monitor volatile compounds in effluent of a domestic wastewater
   treatment plant. Effluent and reference (deionized water) samples were
   heated to 60 and 90 degreesC to promote the volatilization and to
   increase the sensitivity. An effluent measuring campaign of 12 weeks was
   conducted and the repeatability and reproducibility of the procedure and
   the apparatus were determined. Processing the obtained fingerprints with
   principal component analysis (PCA) allowed interpretation and
   differentiation of the samples in terms of origin and quality, relative
   to the reference. To minimize the Variance due to sensitivity
   fluctuations of the apparatus and to detect effluents with deviating
   qualities, two new concepts were defined, i.e. the relative sensorial
   odour perception tin short: rSOP) and the relative fingerprint.
   Correlations between the relative overall electronic nose output,
   expressed as rSOP, and selected routine parameters were weak except for
   the parameter ``volatile suspended solids{''} (VSS), indicating
   adsorption of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) onto the organic
   particles. The results clearly demonstrate the possibility to use the
   electronic nose as a rapid alarm generator towards volatile compounds,
   e.g. in specific advanced treatment processes to produce reclaimed water
   from effluent of the domestic wastewater treatment plant under scrutiny.

Abstract = {{Activities of the extracellular enzymes beta -glucosidase and
   phosphatase and bacterial densities were investigated during the
   filtration process at several sites in a groundwater recharge plant at
   the Ruhr river (Hengsen recharge plant in Schwerte, Germany). Low
   numbers of microorganisms and low levels of activity in this type of
   habitat, compared to most surface waters, caused methodological problems
   when determining microbial activity. In this study, fluorigenic model
   substrates, which enable hydrolytic rates as low as 1 nmol (L x h)(-1)
   to be measured, were used to determine extracellular enzyme activities,
   Highest activities were determined in surface water (107 nmol (L x
   h)(-1) for beta -glucosidase and 252 nmol (L x h)(-1) for phosphatase),
   which decreased during the filtration process in the gravel prefilter
   and the main sand filter until the end of subsurface flow (1.6 nmol (L x
   h)(-1) and 6.8 nmol (L x h)(-1), respectively). Similarly, bacterial
   numbers decreased from 3.4 x 100 to 0.29 x 10(6) cells mL(-1). These
   data showed that microbial activity within the prefilter and the shallow
   layers of the sand filter had the greatest impact on water quality. In
   addition to its involvement in the continuous purification of surface
   water, the microbial community in the sand filter probably acts as a
   biological buffer against ephemeral increases in the lends of organic
   matter and nutrients in the recharge plant. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A combination of a sensitive catalytic determination method with
   filtration and ultrafiltration has been used for the physicochemical
   speciation of molybdenum in natural and synthetic rain water samples.
   The concentration (C-L) of labile molybdenum was evaluated by a direct
   catalytic determination. The total concentration (C-T) Of molybdenum was
   determined after the acid decomposition of the sample to calculate the
   non-labile concentration (C-T-C-L). From the speciation results,
   molybdenum species in the successive rainfall sample were found in a
   fraction with smaller molecular weights < 10(3) Da and characterized as
   labile forms, i.e. simple molybdate ions. Non-labile molybdenum existed
   in particulate matter (greater than or equal to0.45 mum in particle
   size) and distributed predominantly in the initial rainfall sample. The
   coprecipitation with Fe(III) hydroxide contributed to the formation of
   the non-labile molybdenum. In the initial rainfall sample, a small part
   of molybdenum was labile in the particle fraction (greater than or equal
   to0.45 mum). This type of molybdenum was associated with the formation
   of humic iron aggregates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The composition and chlorophenol-degrading potential of groundwater
   bacterial community in a permanently cold, oxygen-deficient chlorophenol
   contaminated aquifer at Karkola Finland was studied with the aim of
   evaluating bl situ bioremediation potential. The groundwater contained
   from 10(4) to 10(7) microscopically counted cells/ml and up to 10(5)
   CFU/ml heterotrophic bacteria cultivable at 8 and 20 degreesC. Of the
   102 pure cultures, of which 86\% Gram-negative, from the plume area
   (10,000 mug of chlorophenols/l), 57\% degraded 2, 3, 4,
   6-tetrachlorophenol (TeCP), the main component of the wood preservative
   which was the source of contamination; 17\% also degraded
   pentachlorophenol (PCP). The degraders were scattered among 16 different
   clusters of Gram-negatives mainly proteobacteria and members of
   Cytophaga/Flexibactel/Bacteroides phylum judged by the composition of
   whole-cell fatty acids. Only one Gram-positive degrading cluster was
   found containing seven actinobacteria closest to Nocardioides. Of the 88
   pure cultures isolated from outside the plume (< 10 mug of
   chlorophenols/l) 67\% were Gramnegative. Seven percent of the isolates
   degraded 2, 3, 4, 6-TeCP and/or PCP. Five of the Gram-positive isolates
   from outside the plume were Mycobacterium/Rhodococcus-related
   actinobacteria and O-methylated 2, 3, 4, 6-TeCP and PCP. The results
   show that chlorophenol degrading bacterial flora had been enriched as a
   result of contamination of the aquifer. This suggests significant in
   situ bioremediation potential of the site. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Measurement of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) in lake

Abstract = {{Once-through, plug-flow bioreactors were colonised and maintained with a
   microbial community from a mesotrophic lake and used to measure the
   concentration of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC). A BDOC
   measurement can be done within 3-4h by this method. Glucose was used to
   test whether oxygen consumption (BOD) could substitute for measurements
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). All added glucose was utilised,
   however, without a concomitant increase in oxygen demand. Oxygen
   consumption should not be used in bioreactor measurements. The
   site-specificity was tested by comparing DOC utilisation in bioreactors
   with batch cultures inoculated with indigenous bacteria and incubated
   for 28 days. The bioreactors were not site-specific and required no
   acclimation to measure BDOC from three different systems. However, humic
   substances were adsorbed in the reactors and about two days were needed
   to equilibrate the reactors. The BDOC concentrations in two lakes varied
   2-fold over diurnal cycles and 3-fold during the period February-June.
   No significant relations to the light/dark cycle, chlorophyll, and DOC
   were found. The absolute BDOC concentrations ranged from 20 to almost
   200 muM and averaged 13\% of the DOC in the lakes. It is concluded that
   BDOC in lakes and other fresh waters can be measured quickly and
   reliably with a bioreactor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biological aerated filters (BAFs) are an attractive process option,
   particularly when low land usage is required. They can combine BOD,
   solids and ammoniacal nitrogen removal and can be utilised at both
   secondary and tertiary stages of wastewater treatment. Media selection
   is critical in the design and operation of BAFs to achieve effluent
   quality requirements. Two size ranges, 1.5-3.5 and 2.5-4.5 mm, of a
   foamed clay called Starlight C were used in pilot-scale reactors. Both
   performed well as BAF media, with reactor loads up to 12kg COD m(-3) d
   and 4 kg suspended solids m(-3) d (based oil working volumes). The most
   consistent effluent was obtained using the smaller medium since, at flow
   rates above 0.41 min(-1). The most consistent effluent was obtained
   using the smaller medium since, at flow rates above 0.41 min(-1), the
   BAF using the larger medium produced an effluent containing more than 20
   mg l(-1) of suspended solids for over 30 min after backwashing. Up to
   70\% longer run times, as determined by reaching a set head loss, were
   recorded for the BAF containing the larger rather than the smaller
   medium. Additionally, the development of pressure above the smaller
   medium filter bed tended to be logarithmic rather than linear. Reactor
   profiles indicated that suspended solids removal did not occur over the
   full 2.3 m depth of the columns. The BAF containing the smaller medium
   utilised a mean depth of 1.7 +/- 0.3 m, whereas a mean depth of 2.1 +/-
   0.3 m was used by the larger medium BAF. Both the head loss development
   data and the suspended solids removal profiles indicated that the
   smaller medium BAF was underperforming as a filter. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effective operation of wastewater treatment plants plays an
   important role in minimising the release of xenobiotic compounds into
   the aquatic environment. Considerable effort has been expended in
   developing models to quantify the overall removal and fate of these
   compounds in biological treatment plants. A synthesis and modification
   of these approaches has been made and a generalised fate model for
   organic compounds in an activated sludge plant is presented. The
   influence of the different-removal mechanisms, such as sorption,
   volatilisation and advection for chemicals with different
   physico-chemical properties is investigated and the important role of
   biotransformation is discussed. The effect of some operating parameters
   has been found to have an important influence upon the concentration of
   xenobiotic released in the sludges and final effluent. This may have
   significance for a wide range of ecotoxic compounds and in particular
   the class of compounds increasingly recognised as having the potential
   to disrupt endocrine activity in some aquatic vertebrates. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{To understand the effects of diffuse pollution information on the source
   of pollutants, quantities in transport, mode of transport, transient
   nature of the pollution event, and most importantly, a consideration of
   remediation efforts need to be known. For example, water quality
   research in the Yazoo Basin uplands in Mississippi has shown sediment
   loads from a conventional-till upland soybean watershed to be about
   19,000 kg/ha/yr, and responsible for 77-96\% of P and N in transport. In
   contrast, sediment loads from a comparable no-till soybean watershed
   were only 500 kg/ha/yr, transporting about 31\% of P and N in transport.
   Sediment loads from a nearby forested area were low, about 200kg/ha/yr,
   but responsible for about 47-76\% of P and N in transport. Transient
   pollution events are responsible for the transport of large quantities
   of sediment, nutrients, and pesticides; in some storm events nearly the
   annual load. Best management practices (BMPs) must be designed to
   remediate diffuse pollution and the transient nature of pollution events
   which can have a profound effect on the ecological health of steams and
   reservoirs. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A set of four assays designed to rapidly measure the health and
   biodegradative performance of pulp and paper mill activated sludges was
   developed. Three of the assays are specific oxygen uptake rates (SOURs)
   that measure the normal ``working{''} aeration tank BOD (biochemical
   oxygen demand) removal rate (SOURAT), a near-maximum BOD removal rate
   (SOURNMAX), and a rate (SOURTOX) used in combination with the SOURNMAX
   to indicate the presence of toxic or inhibitory substances. The fourth
   assay is the specific adenosine triphosphate (SATP) content of the
   sludge, used as a measure of its viable cell content. Fresh biomass
   (sludge) samples from one laboratory reactor and four mill biotreatment
   systems were fed raw mill effluents and used to evaluate the four-assay
   set. The SOURAT Values of all systems were 10-40\% of their SOURNMAX
   values: thus the SOURAT:SOURNMAX ratios indicate that each system's free
   biodegradative capacity was far greater than its operating rate. It was
   demonstrated using phenol that the SOURNMAX:SOURTOX ratio can indicate
   the presence of substances toxic or inhibitory to the biomass. The
   results also indicated that the SOURNMAX is a much better indicator of
   improving or worsening sludge performance and capacity than the SOURAT.
   SATP was shown to be a useful monitor of the proportion of viable cells
   in an activated sludge and a toxicity indicator complementary to the
   SOURNMAX:SOURTOX ratio and similar in principle to the commercial
   Microtox (R) toxicity test. This four-assay set was also applied to
   three practical situations: (a) at-mill monitoring of a biotreatment
   system; (b) effects of cold storage on biomass; and (c) effects of
   decreased BOD loading on biomass. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the rate of utilization of easily biodegradable
   organic compounds by drinking water biofilms. Tap water, which had been
   filtered through biologically active granular activated carbon, was used
   as an innoculum for biofilm growth in annular reactors (ARs). Synthetic
   cocktails of easily biodegradable material in the concentration range of
   50-2000 mg C/m(3) were used as substrate for biofilm growth. Influent
   and effluent aggregate concentrations of biodegradable organic matter
   (BOM) were calculated by adding the measurable BOM components on a mass
   carbon basis. The aggregate BOM values were used for calculating the
   observed Damkohler number and Theile modulus (based on a reaction rate
   per unit surface area), which were used to determine whether external or
   internal mass transfer limited BOM removal. For all of the experimental
   trials, it was shown that neither external nor internal mass transfer
   limited BOM removal. Because the biofilms in this research ore thin and
   the Tact that mass transfer is not limiting, it was assumed that the
   bulk BOM concentration was approximately equal to the average BOM
   concentration in the biofilm. A linear model was obtained for the
   aggregate BOM flux and the product of the effluent BOM concentration and
   the biofilm density. The slope or the areal biodegradation rate (k(a))
   for the aggregate BOM was 0.033 m/h, as determined through a linear
   regression. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is fundamental to many biogeochemical
   processes in soils and natural waters. Despite the large number of
   studies reporting on DOM losses from forest soils and in surface waters
   there is little published data on exports from managed grasslands. The
   objective of our study was to determine the extent of short-term exports
   of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from managed grazed grasslands and to
   evaluate the influence of fertilizer management and drainage regime. DOC
   discharged from grazed grassland plots, with a range of management
   strategies, was determined over 2 months. Total export varied from 42 to
   118 kg C ha(-1), and was greater from some plots than literature
   estimates for annual losses from all catchment types. There was a
   significant (P = 0.048) positive correlation between DOC export and
   rates of nitrogen application for treatments with no artificial
   drainage. Increased dry matter production arising from increased
   fertilizer-N inputs is suggested as an important factor in this
   relationship. DOC export was significantly (P = 0.032) reduced by
   artificial drainage and adsorption of DOC to soil surfaces and the
   restriction of decomposition due to waterlogging are suggested as two
   possible explanations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   by stabilizers Na2CO3 and H2O2 are analyzed. Meanwhile, thermostability,
   UV absorption spectrum, specificity of the paper chromatogram,
   microstructure and ionic chromatogram of this solution were studied, and
   contrasted with pure NaClO2 and ClO2. The results show that ClO2 in
   ``stabilized chlorine dioxide{''} solution exists in the form of
   chlorite ClO2-, carbonate exists in the form of bicarbonate, Therefore,
   it is considered that ``stabilized chlorine dioxide{''} solution is
   mixed solution of ClO2- and HCO3- its pH being 8.5. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The levels of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in the Campaspe
   River system, North Central Victoria, Australia, were monitored from
   January to September 1995, and the environmental trends and sources of
   these compounds were determined. The land use within particular
   catchments dictated the complexity of the SVOCs in run-off water. Run-oh
   from native forest contained the greatest number of SVOCs. Soil and
   ground litter were shown to contain the greatest complexity of SVOCs.
   mostly terpenes. However, only a small proportion were leached by
   run-off with the remainder being rightly bound to the soil or
   volatilizing to the atmosphere. Under the prevailing drought of early
   1995, the rivers contained no detectable SVOCs until the first catchment
   run-off after significant rainfall in May. The maximum complexity and
   concentration of the SVOCs coincided with extensive run-off after heavy
   rainfall in June. effecting a surge of SVOCs with the flood peak. Fatty
   acids. their amides and hydrocarbons made up the majority of the
   compounds identified and were in the 1-39 mug/l concentration range. The
   levels then diminished as the catchment was flushed by continual
   run-off. These results support Lake's 1967 hypothesis that natural
   floodwaters contain a signature of SVOCs entering from the catchment.
   The downstream passage of these compounds was obstructed by a man-made
   storage, Lake Eppalock, with only low concentrations of SVOCs (1-3
   mug/l) in the outflow, displaying no correlation to run-off. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Rainfall-induced runoff transported sediments and pesticides into the
   Lourens River and its tributaries during a 28.8-mm rainstorm in
   mid-December 1998. Average I-h peak levels of current-use insecticides
   applied to adjacent orchard plots were 1.5 mug l(-1) azinphos-methyl,
   0.2 mug l(-1) chlorpyrifos and 2.9 mug l(-1) total endosulfan (alpha,
   beta, S) in the river itself. Respective average I-h pesticide levels
   associated with suspended particles were 1247, 924 and 12082 mug kg(-1)
   along with 980 mug kg(-1) of prothiofos. Total suspended solids
   increased during runoff From 32 to 520 mg l(-1). The contaminated
   edge-of-field runoff entered the river via the tributaries directly
   bordering the orchard-growing areas. Increased concentrations of
   azinphos-methyl and prothiofos associated with suspended sediments were
   demonstrated to persist for about 3.5 months without any further input
   in one of the tributaries. This illustrates that the short-term exposure
   has the potential to result in long-term contamination of surface
   waters. In terms of chemical load during the 1-h peak discharge period,
   the single rainfall event caused a loss of 173 g h(-1) azinphosmethyl,
   55 g h(-1) chlorpyrifos, 740 g h(-1) total endosulfan (alpha, beta, S)
   and 41 g h(-1) prothiofos. Levels of contamination were extremely high;
   they exceed the national water quality standards and those established
   by the US EPA. A comparison with standard toxicity data and 24-h LC50 s
   for the local amphipod species Paramelita nigroculus, obtained during
   this study, indicates that the concentrations round in the river may
   result in acute toxic effects on aquatic invertebrates and fishes. A
   probability analysis of 10-y rainfall data revealed that the Frequency

Abstract = {{This study investigates the oxidative transformation of
   diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (DTPA). a synthetic ligand. during
   drinking water ozonation. The rate coefficients for the reactions of
   CaDTPA(3-) and ZnDTPA(3-) with ozone were determined to be 6200 and 3500
   +/- 150 M-1, respectively. The reactivity of Fe(III)DTPA(2-) towards
   ozone was found to be much lower (< 10 M(-1)s(-1)), but near neutral pH
   the reactivity of the Fe(III)-complexes is dominated by
   {[}Fe(III)(OH)]DTPA(3-). For the reaction of Fe{[}(III)(OH)]DTPA(3) with
   ozone a rate coefficient of 2.4 <plus/minus> 0.2 x 10(5)M(-1) s(-1) was
   measured. The rate coefficients of the reactions of the ZnDTPA-and
   Fe(III)DTPA with OH radicals have been determined by a competitive
   method as 2.4 +/- 0.4 x 10(9) and 1.5 +/- 0.1 x 10(9) M-1 s(-1),
   respectively at pH = 7. The degradation of low concentrations of DTPA
   complexes during ozonation was investigated in natural waters under
   drinking water relevant conditions. Based on our findings CaDTPA(3-) and
   ZnDTPA(3-) are judged as easily degradable. Fe(III)DTPA complexes showed
   a somewhat lower reactivity, but were still typically degraded by one
   order of magnitude at ozone dosages of similar to 20 muM (1 mg L-1) in
   the three natural waters tested. Molecular ozone was found to be the
   major oxidant for the metal-DTPA complexes during ozonation. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Three isomer chlorophenols. o-. m-. p-chlorophenol, were dechlorinated
   by palladium,:iron powder in water through catalytic reduction. The
   dechlorinated reaction is believed to take place on the surface site of
   the catalyst in a pseudo-first-order reaction. The reduction product for
   all the three isomers is phenol. The dechlorination rate increases with
   increase of bulk loading of palladium due to the increase of both the
   surface loading of palladium and the total surface area. The molecular
   structure also has an effect on the dechlorination rate. For conditions
   with 0.048\%; Pd:Fe. the rate constants are 0.0215, 0.0155 and 0.0112
   min(-1) for o-, m-, p-chlorophenol. respectively. Almost complete
   dechlorination is achieved within 5h. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Denitrification is the most important mechanism of nitrogen retention in

   denitrification has been relatively rare. Here, we use the N-2 flux

   highly variable with an average rate of 111 mu mol N m(-2) h(-1)
   Littoral denitrification rates were positively related to temperature
   (r(2) = 0,66. p < 0.01). \% organic matter (r(2) = 0.31, p < 0.05) and
   macrophyte: biomass density and negatively related to depth. These
   results in combination with an analysis of the literature and a

Abstract = {{Laboratory and half-technical scale experiments were performed to
   evaluate nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) production during
   biological N-elimination from wastewater with high ammonium
   concentration (about 700 mg N L-1). In a laboratory scale bioreactor
   with biomass retention, the ammonia oxidizer Nitrosomonas europaea and
   the denitrifier Paracoccus denitrificans were grown as reference
   organisms in co-culture in order to simulate the nitrifying and
   denitrifying community of wastewater treatment plants. Synthetic
   wastewater and sludge liquor from the municipal wastewater treatment
   plant in Lueneburg (Germany) were used. In the laboratory scale reactor,
   during the treatment of synthetic wastewater, 0.28\% of the oxidized
   ammonium-N was released as NO-N by a pure culture of Nitrosomonas. A
   simultaneously nitrifying and denitrifying co-culture only released 0.04
   to 0.2\%. NO2 formation was not observed. NO production was much higher
   in sludge liquor. A pure culture of Nitrosomonas produced 0.52\% NO +
   NO2-N ( = NOx-N), a co-culture of Nitrosomonas and Paracoccus even
   1.64\% NOx-N. The production rate strongly depended on the media and the
   organisms used. In a coculture of N. europaea and P denitrificans,
   Nitrosomonas war shown to be the most efficient NO producer NO
   production increased with ammonium oxidation rate and with nitrite
   concentration of the medium. In synthetic wastewater, NO production was
   not influenced by reduced oxygen content. However, in sludge liquor NO
   production rate increased with decreasing O-2 concentration. Here, for
   the first time, the Formation of significant amounts of NO2 during
   simultaneous nitrification/denitrification could be demonstrated. In
   half-technical scale experiments, only 0.07\% of the oxidized ammonium-N
   was released as NO-N from the nitrification stage. NO2 was not
   detectable. Release of nitric oxide from the denitrification stage was
   mainly diffusion limited and the amount produced did not exceed
   0.0001\%. A calculation on the basis of the results presented, revealed
   that biological treatment of nitrogen-rich wastewater is not a
   significant source for pollution of the atmosphere with NOx, in
   industrial areas. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The applicability of the previously developed method for electrochemical
   determination of dissolved uranium concentration has been tested on
   natural water samples taken from the Krka river estuary during various
   seasons and along different depth profiles. The method is based on the
   following treatment of the sample: destroying the uranyl-carbonato
   complexes by adjusting the pH to 3. enabling the formation of adsorbable
   uranyl-hydroxo complexes by adjusting the pH to 6.5-7.0 and measurement
   by cathodic stripping voltammetry technique. As the signal of the
   dissolved uranium reduction is sometimes masked by the signal of the
   matrix of the sample, a resolution enhancement including digestion
   and:or deconvolution has to be applied. The measured concentration of
   dissolved uranium varies in the range from 0.4 to 3.3 x 10(-8) mol
   l(-1), corresponding to the data found in the literature. The depth
   profile of dissolved uranium concentration distributions shows
   conservative behaviour.
   The X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) confirmed the applicability of
   the method, yet pointing out to its limitations caused by the matrix of
   the solution. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights: reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous Cr(VI) reduction and phenol degradation was observed in a
   fixed-film bioreactor consisting of a coculture of phenol-degrading
   bacteria, Pseudomonas putida DMP-1, and Cr(VI)-reducing bacteria.
   Escherichia coli ATCC 33456. Near complete Cr(VI) reduction and phenol
   degradation was observed during steady-state operation of the reactor
   under loadings of 5-21 mg Cr(VI) l(-1) d(-1) and 840 3350 mg phenol
   l(-1) d(-1). 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde (2HMSA), succinate, and
   acetate were the detected steady-state organic acid metabolites which
   accounted for 13-23\% of TOC in the effluent. Optimum Cr(VI) reduction
   rate was observed under a Cr(VI) loading of approximately 26.5mg Cr(VI)
   l(-1) d(-1) just before system overload. System overload was
   characterized by the increase in effluent Cr(VI) and phenol
   concentrations. System resilience to Cr(VI) toxicity was demonstrated by
   rapid recovery of biological activity and reduced effluent Cr(VI) and
   phenol concentrations after off-loading the system from overloaded
   conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   from an agricultural zone of the Yaqui Valley located in northwest
   Mexico. Trace determinations were made bq liquid chromatography (LC)
   with post-column fluorescence detection (EPA method 531.1) or LC-diode
   array UV detection coupled on-line to a solid-phase extraction (SPE)
   system and using a 13 x 4.6 mm i.d. precolumn and a 150 x 4.6mm i.d,
   analytical column, both packed with a C18 silica. Results indicated that
   the level of contamination with methiocarb was 5.4 mug/L in a
   groundwater sample and that for 3-hydroxycarbofuran was 18 mug/L in a
   surface water sample. This study provides the basis for a future

Abstract = {{The photodegradation rates of seven chlorinated hydrocarbons; C2Cl4,
   C2HCl3, C2H4Cl2 1,1,1-C2H3Cl3, 1,1,2-C2H3Cl3. CHCl3, CHCl4 were
   investigated under the UV bandwidths of 185 and 254 nm in the presence
   and absence of dissolved oxygen (DO) in water. These hydrocarbons are
   possible contaminants of groundwater. This study confirms that the
   degradation rates of all chlorinated hydrocarbons are elevated in the
   absence of DO. This was especially apparent for chlorinated methane and
   ethane. Tetrachloroethylene's rate was the highest among the seven
   hydrocarbons regardless of the DO levels. It was clear that the
   concentration of intermediate trichloroethylene produced by
   photodegradation of tetrachloroethylene in the absence of DO was 1/50th
   of that in the presence of DO. Photodegradation in the presence of DO
   resulted in the formation of O-3 and hydroxyl radicals. Alternatively,
   the photodegradation in the absence of DO resulted in the formation of
   organic radicals and a dissociation of the bond. It is discussed that DO
   acts as an ``inner filter{''} or ``scavenger'' that reduces the UV light
   intensity in the photoreactor. Molecular O-2 has absorption bands at 185
   and 254 nm, the former being stronger. The processes of degradation
   depend on the degradation rate relative to the presence and absence of
   DO. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   sites. At each site. two monitor wells were installed along the
   groundwater flow, and one multilevel sampler (MLS) was installed to
   delineate the vertical distribution of the contaminant plume. Two
   continuous soil cores were collected at each site to evaluate the
   horizontal distribution of the microbial activity. Soil samples were
   used for microbial enumeration, grain-size distribution analysis, and
   sediment extraction. In situ tracer study was performed using
   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB) as the tracer to study the efficiency
   of contaminant biodegradation. investigation results demonstrate the
   agreement between microbial enumeration and other evaluation techniques
   for natural bioremediation (e.g.. geochemical indicator analysis, tracer
   study). Results suggest that the microbial enumeration is useful in
   assessing the occurrence, efficiency, and status of the bioremediation.
   Because this technique provides insight into factors controlling
   contaminant biodegradation, it could be performed as the supplemental
   method for natural bioremediation evaluation at petroleum-hydrocarbon
   spill sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality associated with nitrate (NO3- leaching from agricultural
   soils is an important environmental issue. This paper describes a new
   modelling approach to quantitatively evaluate the effect of the use of
   fertilisers on global nitrate leaching. A global process-based
   simulation model was previously developed for the nitrogen cycle in
   terrestrial ecosystems, in which soil inorganic nitrogen in the form df
   ammonium (NH4+) and NOS was considered. After introducing data on world
   fertiliser consumption (FAO, 1995) into the steady-state model, the
   extent of disturbance to the nitrogen cycle caused by fertilisation was
   calculated, Although fertilisation resulted in an annual increase in net
   primary production (NPP, represented as carbon) of 18 Gt year(-1). NO3-
   leaching and gaseous losses of nitrogen oxides and ammonia were also
   accelerated. Most regions with heavy fertiliser application lover 100 kg
   ha(-1) year(-1) . About 2.5\% of the land area showed a high annual
   leaching load equal to or more than 20 kg ha(-1) year occupied by
   terrestrial ecosystems suffered a serious leaching load of more than 30
   kg ha(-1) year(-1). Of the total amount of applied fertilisers (138 Tg
   year(-1)) 19\% was lost to NO3- leaching, 8\% to gaseous ammonia, and
   3\% to gaseous nitrogen oxides. The rest was assumed to be fixed in the
   ecosystems through vegetation uptake. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Autotrophic denitrification of synthetic wastewater by Thiobacillus
   denitrificans in upflow sulphur packed-bed reactors was studied in order
   to establish the process kinetics for prediction of effluent
   concentration. Elemental sulphur particles of different size served as
   energy substrate as well as the physical support for the microbial
   biofilm. Experiments were performed under operating conditions of (i)
   different flow rates at constant influent nitrate concentration; and
   (ii) different influent nitrate concentrations at constant flow rate.
   The experimental results show that autotrophic denitrification rates in
   upflow sulphur packed-bed reactors can be described by a half-order
   kinetic model for biofilms. IL was found that the half-order kinetic
   constants of upflow packed-bed reactors are 2.94-3.60, 1.47-2.04, and
   1.12-1.29 mg(1/2)/L-1/2 h for sulphur particle sizes of 2.8-5.6,
   5.6-11.2, and 11.2-16 mm, respectively. The half-order kinetic constants
   could be related to the specific surface area of the reactor media by a
   simple equation, Successful application of the half-order reaction rate
   model was demonstrated for an actual wastewater (nitrified leachate). A
   comparison with the literature showed that the half-order reaction rate
   constants for autotrophic denitrification using elemental sulphur are
   approximately one order of magnitude lower than those of heterotrophic
   denitrification. An improved stoichiometric equation for autotrophic
   denitrification using elemental sulphur as electronic donor is also
   proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Mobilisation of contaminants is an important issue in environmental risk
   assessment of dredging projects. This study has aimed at identifying the
   effects of dredging on mobilisation of trace metals (Zn, Cu. Cd and Ph).
   The intensities and time scales of trace metal mobilisation were
   investigated during an experimental dredging project conducted under
   field conditions. The loss of contaminated dredge spoil is mainly
   reflected by increasing levels of trace metals in the suspended matter:
   dissolved trace metal concentrations in the water column are not
   significantly influenced bq the dredging activities, This indicates a
   strong binding mechanism of trace metals to the solid phase or a fast
   redistribution over sorptive phases in response to oxidation of e.g.
   trace metal sulphides. Given the differences in levels of reactive
   phases (Mn, Fe, sulphides and organic matter) between the riverine
   suspended matter and the sediments, changes in the levels of these
   parameters in the suspended matter upon dredging may give information on
   the processes influencing the behaviour of trace metals and on the
   potential loss of sediment during dredging operations. Therefore, we
   recommend to routinely measure these parameters in studies on
   contaminant behaviour related to dredging activities. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The degradation of 2,4-Dichlorophenol (From now on 2,4-DCP) has been
   carried out on Nation-Fe (1.78\%) in the presence of H2O2 under visible
   light irradiation. A solution containing 2,4-DCP (TOC 72 mg C/L)) is
   seen to be mineralized in similar to1 h in the presence of H2O2 (10mM)
   under solar simulated visible light (80mWcm(-2)) at pH values between
   2.8 and 11. Homogeneous photo-assisted Fenton reactions were capable of
   mediating 2,4-DCP degradaiiun only up to pH 5.4. The degradation
   kinetics of 2,4-DCP on Nation Fe membranes was more favorable than the
   one observed during Fenton photoassisted processes at pH 2.8. The
   degradation of 2,4-DCP was investigated as a function of the substrate.
   oxidant concentration and applied light intensity. The Nafion - Fe was
   seen to he effective over many cycles during the photo-catalytic
   degradation of 2,4-DCP showing an efficient and table performance during
   4-DCP degradation without leaching out Fe3+-ions into the solution.
   Evidence is presented that the degradation at the surface of the
   Nation-Fe membrane seems to be controlled by mass transfer and not by
   chemical reaction of the species in solution. The approach used to
   degrade 2,4-DCP is shown to be valid for other chloro-carbons like
   4-chlorophenol, 2,3-chlorophenol and 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. (C) 2001

   stabilization}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2003-2009}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The pretreatment of waste activated sludge by ultrasonic disintegration
   was studied in order to improve the anaerobic sludge stabilization. The
   ultrasound frequency was varied within a range from 41 to 3217 kHz. The
   impact of different ultrasound intensities and treatment times was
   examined. Sludge disintegration was most significant at low frequencies.
   Low-frequency ultrasound creates large cavitation bubbles which upon
   collapse initiate powerful jet streams exerting strong sheer forces in
   the liquid. The decreasing sludge disintegration efficiency observed at
   higher frequencies was attributed to smaller cavitation bubbles which do
   not allow the initiation of such strong shear forces. Short sonication
   times resulted in sludge floc deagglomeration without the destruction of
   bacteria cells. Longer sonication brought about the breakup of cell
   walls, the sludge solids were disintegrated and dissolved organic
   compounds were released. The anaerobic digestion of waste activated
   sludge following ultrasonic pretreatment causing microbial cell lysis
   was significantly improved, There was an increase in the volatile solids
   degradation as well as an increase in the biogas production. The
   increase in digestion efficiency was proportional to the degree of
   sludge disintegration. To a lesser degree the deagglomeration of sludge
   flocs also augmented the anaerobic volatile solids degradation. (C) 2001

   depends also on the kind and number of nitrogen atoms. Complexing agents
   with a single-nitrogen atom in the molecule (e.g. NTA) succumb
   relatively readily to biodegradation whereas, compounds with two or more
   tertiary amino groups are biologically highly stable and do not undergo
   biodegradation even in experiments with activated sludge adapted at an
   age of up to 30 days (EDTA. DTPA. PDTA, HEDTA). A lowering of the degree
   of substitution brines about an increased susceptibility to
   biodegradation. This holds, e.g., for replacement of tertiary amino
   groups with secondary ones; thus the symmetrically disubstituted
   ethylenediamine-N,N ` -diacetic acid (EDDA) possesses still sufficient

Abstract = {{Spent caustic from olefin plants contains much H2S and some mercaptans,
   phenols and oil. A new treatment process of spent caustic by
   neutralization followed by oxidation with Fenton's reagent (Fe2+ /H2O2)
   was successfully developed. Over 90\% of dissolved H2S were converted to
   gas phase by neutralization at pH = 5 and T = 70 degrees, and the vent
   gas stream could be introduced to sulfur recover); plant. The
   neutralized liquid was oxidized with OH free radical, which was provided
   by a Fenton's reagent. The residual sulfides in the neutralized spent
   caustic were oxidized to less than 0.1 mg/L. The total COD removal of
   spent caustic is over 99.5\% and the final COD value of the effluent can
   be lower than 100 mg/L under the following oxidation conditions:reaction
   time = 50 min, T = 90 degrees, Fe2 + = 100 mg/L, and a stoichiometric
   H2O2/COD = 1.1. The value is better than the 800 mg/L value obtained by
   common WAO process. The optimum pH of the Fenton reaction is around 2
   for this process, and the oxidation step can maintain a pH Value in the
   range of 1.8-2.4. Moreover, the iron catalyst can be recycled without
   affecting process effectiveness thus preventing secondary pollution. (C)

   Oscillatoria and Synedra decrease due to the increase in total nitrogen.
   while the growth of Phormidium is enhanced with more nitrogen, In

Abstract = {{Biological clogging is promoted in aquifers either to contain or to
   remediate groundwater. In this study. an apparatus able to detect small
   changes in hydraulic conductivity (K) was developed to measure the
   clogging of a single fracture in limestone, following microbial
   stimulation. The fracture had a 2.5 mm(2) section and was 50cm long.
   Prior to the inoculation of the limestone, the sequencing ol
   representative clones from 16S rRNA gents isolated from groundwater,
   showed significant affiliation with Cytophaga spp., Arcobacter spp. and
   Rhizobium spp. These bacteria are known to secrete extracellular
   polymeric substances and form biofilms. When nutrients were added to the
   inoculated limestone, a decrease in K occurred after 8 days, reaching
   0.8\% L of its initial value after 22 days (K-n = 330 cm min(-1)) This
   study should that a stimulation of Indigenous microbes from groundwater
   effectively clogged a macrofracture ill limestone. suggesting the
   potential application of biobarriers in Fractured rock aquifers. (C)

Abstract = {{A mathematical model of soluble microbial products (SMPs)
   formation-degradation was established based on the activated sludge
   model no.1 and was applied to the membrane bioreactor process with high
   concentration of activated sludge under intermittent aerobic operational
   condition. The simulation results were in good agreement with the
   experimental data which indicated that the coefficients used in the
   model could successfully describe the treatment performance. The most
   advantage of this modified model over the conventional one was that the
   significant importance of SMP existence was demonstrated and the model
   provided an reasonable comprehension for SMP concept. The present study
   demonstrated that SMPs contributed most to the organic matter in the
   effluent. and the results coincided well with the observations of many
   other researchers. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Equilibrium and kinetic adsorption of tri-valent (arsenite) and
   penta-valent (arsenate) arsenic to activated alumina is elucidated. The
   properties of activated alumina. including porosity. specific surface
   area, and skeleton density were first measured. A batch reactor with
   temperature control was employed to determine both adsorption capacity
   and adsorption kinetics For arsenite and arsenate to activated-alumina
   grains. The Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm equations were then used to
   describe the partitioning behavior for the system at different pH. A
   pore diffusion model, coupled with the observed Freundlich or Langmuir
   isotherm equations, was used to interpret an observed experimental
   adsorption kinetic curve for arsenite at one specific condition. The
   model was found to fit with the experimental data Fairly well, and pore
   diffusion coefficients can be extracted. The model. incorporated with
   the interpreted pore diffusion coefficient, was then employed to predict
   the experimental data Tor arsenite and arsenate at various conditions,
   including different initial arsenic concentrations, grain sizes of
   activated alumina, and system pHs. The model predictions were found to
   describe the experimental data fairly well, even though the tested
   conditions substantially differed From one another. The agreement among
   the models and experimental data indicated that the adsorption and
   diffusion of arsenate and arsenite can be simulated by the proposed
   model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Standard methods for the determination of oxygen transfer rate are based
   on assumptions that are not valid for oxidation ditches. This paper
   presents a realistic and simple new method to be used in the estimation
   of oxygen transfer rate in oxidation ditches from clean water
   measurements. The new method uses a loop-of-CSTRs model. which can he
   easily incorporated within control algorithms. for modelling oxidation
   ditches. Further. this method assumes zero oxygen transfer rates (K(L)a)
   in the unaerated CSTRs. Application of a formal estimation procedure to
   real data revealed that the aeration constant (k = K(L)aV(A).. where V-A
   is the volume of the aerated CSTR) can be determined significantly more
   accurately than K(L)a and Cb Therefore. the new method estimates X
   instead of K(L)a. From application to real data, this method proved to
   be more accurate than the commonly used Dutch standard method (STORA.
   1980). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated the nitrogen removal capabilities of a pre-
   and post-denitrification process, when treating sanitary landfill
   leachate containing an ammonia concentration of over 2200 mg N/L, at
   operating temperatures down to 10 C. The treatment system employed is
   generally known as a 4-Stage Bardenpho process. Two parallel systems
   were operated throughout the study. each system had an aerobic solids
   retention time of 20 days and an external recycle ratio (return
   activated sludge) of about 3:1. During the entire experimental period,
   one system used an internal recycle ratio of about 1:1. while the other
   system used one of 3:1. Methanol was used as supplementary carbon source
   for denitrification. When operating temperature was decreased from 70 to
   17 degreesC, an approximate 15\% decrease in denitrification was
   immediately experienced within both Systems, with no noticeable affect
   on nitrification. This was an unexpected result. Subsequently. the
   temperature was further decreased to 14 C, and finally to 10 degreesC.
   With the temperature at 14 degreesC. aerobic wasting was also stopped
   and methanol loading was progressively decreased to match actual
   denitrification requirements. At 10 C. both systems suffered major
   nitrification and denitrification inhibition. Changes in operating
   parameters, such as a decrease in influent ammonia and methanol loading,
   as well as an increase in ambient temperatures, from 10 to 15 degreesC,
   did not significantly improve overall system performance, within a
   reasonable time Frame, Both denitrification and nitrification problems
   were mainly attributed to decreased ambient temperature. although other
   possible factors were noted; at project completion, about 50\% of the
   incoming ammonia was being removed across the system. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Usually, two main terms for concentration are used: amount concentration
   and mass concentration. Mass concentrations can significantly distort
   the actual presentation of inorganic and organic compounds in the
   mixture. They cannot be used when comparing quantity and properties of
   different compounds, when explaining reaction kinetics. reaction
   mechanisms and when investigating relationships between concentration
   and chemical or biological activity. In these cases it is necessary to
   prefer amount concentrations. ``Equivalent concentration{''} is based on
   the charge balance of ions in the solution and not on their actual
   number. The dimension of the equivalent concentration is the same as
   that of amount concentration (e.g. mmoll (1))which concerns also ANC or
   BNC (alkalinity or acidity). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The ammonia-containing waste produced in industries is usually
   characterized by high concentration and high temperature, and is not
   treatable by biological methods directly. In this study, a hydrophobic
   Pt/SDB catalyst was first used in a trickle-bed reactor to remove
   ammonia from wastewater. In the reactor, both stripping and catalytic
   oxidation occur simultaneously. It was found that higher temperature and
   higher oxygen partial pressure enhanced the ammonia removal. A reaction
   pathway, which involves oxidizing ammonia to nitric oxide, which then
   further reacts with ammonia to produce nitrogen and water, was
   confirmed. Small amounts of by-products, nitrites and nitrates were also
   detected in the resultant reaction solution. These compounds came from
   the absorption of nitrogen oxides. Both the minimum NO2- selectivity and
   maximum ammonia removal were achieved when the resultant pH of treated
   water was near 7.5 for a feed of unbuffered ammonia solution. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The construction of evaporative ponds and wetlands for the disposal of
   waste water high in ionic concentrations is a waste disposal strategy
   currently considered by many industries. However, the design,
   construction and management of these ponds and wetlands are not
   straightforward as complex chemical interactions result in both spatial
   and temporal changes in water quality. The effects of evaporation and
   drainage on the water quality in two constructed ponds, an adjacent
   man-made wetland and local groundwater at Portland Aluminium were
   investigated. The minimum volume of water entering the ponds during the
   study period was 0.96 +/- 0.16 ML per month. The predicted theoretical
   evaporative capacity of the two ponds was calculated to be 0.30 +/- 0.07
   ML per month. More water enters the ponds than it is theoretically
   possible to evaporate under the ambient weather conditions at Portland,
   yet the ponds do not overflow, suggesting percolation through the pond
   lining. No spatial differences in solute concentrations (fluoride,
   sulphate, bicarbonate, carbonate, sodium, potassium, calcium, and
   magnesium ions) were found within the waters of either pond, although
   temporal differences were apparent. The results support the conclusion
   that the ponds are not impermeable, and that much of the waste water
   entering the ponds is being lost through seepage. The impacts on local
   groundwater chemistry of this seepage are addressed. Significant
   correlations exist between solute presence within and between the ponds,
   wetland and groundwater. Fluoride and sulphate concentrations were
   significantly higher in pond waters throughout the duration of the
   experiment. Pond sediments revealed a high degree of spatial and
   temporal heterogeneity in the concentration of all monitored ions
   resulting From the chemical heterogeneity of the material making up the
   pond linings. Adsorption isotherms for fluoride indicate that the
   adsorption capacity of the pond linings remains high for this ion.
   Implications for the management of waste water by this strategy are
   discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The results of an experimental study on the destruction of disperse dyes
   by chemical oxidation using ozone, hypochlorite and Fenton reagent
   (H2O2+Fe2+) are compared with the data obtained by electrochemical
   oxidation. While the results obtained during hypochlorite oxidation were
   not satisfactory (only 35\% reduction of colour was achieved at a dose
   of 6 g dm(-3)), ozonation enabled colour to de reduced by up to 90\%
   (ozone dose 0.5 g dm(-3)). A high decolourisation degree was however
   accompanied by a low removal (10\% efficiency) of chemical oxygen demand
   (COD). Trials of electrochemical oxidation proved this process much male
   efficient. Under the conditions of an acidic pH in 40 min of
   electrolysis a 79\% elimination of COD was achieved at the Ti/Pt-Ir
   anode, which proved the best of seven different tested materials.
   Simultaneously 90\% colour was removed. Indirect oxidation, by means of
   chlorine-deriving compounds, was the predominating process leading to
   the pollutants depletion. The best treatment results were obtained with
   the Fenton process, which under the optimal pH equal to 3 and hydrogen
   peroxide and ferrous sulphide dose of 600 and 550 mg dm(-3),
   respectively, resulted in a final effluent bring colourless and with the
   residual COD equal to 100 mg dm(-3). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The influences of pumping shear on the performance of a crossflow
   membrane bioreactor (MBR) were investigated. To compare the intensity of
   pumping shear, two types of pumps (a centrifugal pump and a rotary one)
   were used in turn to recirculate mixed liquor. Rotary pump system
   imposed much stronger shear to microbial flee than centrifugal one and
   resulted in severe floc breakage. Colloidal particles and organics were
   liberated from microbial floc by shear and caused rapid loss of membrane
   permeability by the formation of dense take layers on the surface of
   membrane. Recirculation of mixed liquor with a rotary pump gradually
   increased the soluble COD in the bioreactor and deteriorated microbial
   activity. After 7 days' operation, specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) of
   microorganisms in rotary pump system reduced to 78\% of initial
   condition. With a centrifugal pump, however, buildup of soluble COD was
   not observed and change in microbial activity was negligible. Sludge
   yield in MBR process was lower than that (0.4-0.5 g MLVSS gCOD(-1))
   reported in a conventional activated sludge process: 0.3 g MLVSS
   gCOD(-1) for the centrifugal pump system and 0.2 g MLVSS gCOD(-1) for
   the rotary pump system. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   methane concentrations gradually decreased below the detection Limit.
   Methane oxidizing bacterial numbers increased from IO to 10(4) cells/mL
   with methane consumptions. During methane injection, 10-20\% of TCE
   removal was observed. The biotransformation yield was 3-13 mgTCE/gCH(4)
   in this field test. After methane injections were stopped, TCE removal
   was not observed. There results indicated that bioremediation using

Abstract = {{This study analyses weekly data samples from the river Elbe at Magdeburg
   between 1984 and 1996 to investigate the changes in metabolism and water
   quality in the river Elbe since the German reunification in 1990.
   Modelling water quality variables by autoregressive component models and
   ARIMA models reveals the improvement of water quality due to the
   reduction of waste water emissions since 1990. The models are used to
   determine the long-term and seasonal behaviour of important water
   quality variables. Organic and heavy metal pollution parameters showed a
   significant decrease since 1990, however, no significant change of
   chlorophyll-aw as a measure for primary production could be found. A new
   procedure for testing the significance of a sample correlation
   coefficient is discussed, which is able to detect spurious sample
   correlation coefficients without making use of time-consuming
   prewhitening. The cross-correlation analysis is applied to
   hydrophysical, biological, and chemical water quality variables of the
   river Elbe since 1984. Special emphasis is laid on the detection of
   spurious sample correlation coefficients. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   Pretreatment tests have been performed in an ion exchange packed bed.
   The parameters examined for the pretreatment solution were the

   and for washing after pretreatment the volume of washing water used. An
   optimal flow rate and a minimum concentration were determined, for a
   pretreatment that leads to a high effective capacity of the material,
   while pH adjustment did not result in a higher effective capacity and
   one washing (10 bed volumes) after pretreatment was found to be
   sufficient. Furthermore, the water quality (use of tap water) as well as
   the surface dust of the original material (about 5\% w/w) did not alter

Abstract = {{The removal of heavy metal ions, Ni2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+ using yeast
   (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as carriers in a crossflow microfiltration is
   investigated The affects of yeast cell and electrolyte concentrations on
   the transient and steady-state permeate flux and metal ion rejections
   are established. It is found that the metal ion rejection reaches a
   plateau if yeast cell concentration is greater than similar to2 g/l as a
   result of cell aggregation. The binding affinity of the metals to yeast
   cell is Pb2+ > Cu2+ > Ni2+, which is also reflected in the metal ion
   rejection under identical process conditions. Because of the formation
   of yeast cell flocks in the presence of Pb2+, permeate flux is also
   higher for this metal. The presence of NaCl decreases both rejection and
   permeate flux for Ni2+ and Cu2+ but not for Pb2+. When binary or ternary
   metal mixtures are used, the rejection of the individual metals is
   reduced except that of Pb2+. It is found that the pseudo-gel
   concentration is unaffected by the presence of metal ions. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during ozonation
   results in a higher reduction in trihalomethane formation potential
   (THMFP) relative to dissolved organic carbon (DOC). This study was
   conducted to determine the effect of DOM transformation after ozonation
   on THM formation and to elucidate the difference in THMFP and DOC
   removal. Changes in DOC, THMFP, reactivities of the hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic DOC, and phenolic-OH were determined to explain the
   difference in THMFP and DOC removal after ozonation. Higher reduction in
   THMFP (24-46\%) relative to DOC (10-16\%) was obtained and was
   attributed to the following: transformation of DOM From a more reactive
   hydrophobic DOC (mug THM produced per mg organic carbon) to a less
   reactive hydrophilic DOC and to the decrease in the reactivities of both
   the hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOC after ozonation. The results also
   showed decrease in phenolic-OH indicating the oxidation of some reactive
   sites like resorcinol or meta-dihydroxy benzene ring structures, which
   are prone to chlorine substitution, consequently decreasing. the
   reactivity of the organic carbon to form THM. These changes in DOM led
   to a significant decrease in THMFP with no remarkable removal in DOC.

Abstract = {{Coliform bacteria have long been used to indicate fecal contamination of
   water and thus a health hazard. In this study, the in-mill water and
   external effluent treatment systems of seven typical Canadian pulp and
   paper mills were ail shown to support the growth of numerous coliforms,
   especially Klebsiella Spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., and
   Citrobacter spp. In all mills and most sampled locations, klebsiellas
   were the predominant coliforms. Although all but one of the mills had no
   sewage input and most disinfected their feed (input) water, all
   contained the most typical fecal indicator bacterium, E. coli. Many of
   the mill coliforms were classified as fecal coliforms by standard
   ``MPN{''} and metabolic tests, but this was shown to be due to their
   thermotolerance, not their origin. Mill coliforms were shown not to be
   just simple transients from feedwater or furnish (wood), but to be
   continuously growing, especially in some of the primary clarifiers.
   Isolated mill coliforms grew very well on a sterilized raw combined mill
   effluent. The fecal streptococci (enterococci), alternative indicators
   of fecal health hazards, were common in all mills in the absence of
   sewage. Ten strains of E, coli isolated from four mills were all shown
   to be non-toxigenic strains of harmless serotypes. No salmonellas were
   found. Therefore, the use of total coliform, fecal coliform,
   enterococci, or E. coli counts as indicators of fecal contamination, and
   thus of health hazard in pulp and paper mill effluents or biosolids
   (sludges) known to be free of fecal input is invalid. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the sorption of heavy metals, a crude diatomite was
   impregnated with a microemulsion which showed remarkable increase in
   chromium sorption capacity as compared to untreated diatomite. Samples
   with two different granulometries were investigated; both yielding
   practically complete adsorption. The adsorption process is pH dependent
   and the best results for the initial Cr (III) concentration of 1.5 g/L
   were obtained at pH 2.95. The effect of the concentration of the
   chromium synthetic solution was also investigated. The adsorption
   isotherms were obtained (30, 40 and 50 degreesC) and the Freundlich and
   Langmuir models were used to determine the adsorption capacity of the
   adsorbent. Following the adsorption step, a desorption process was
   carried out using several eluant solutions. The best results were
   obtained using hydrochloric acid (100\%) as eluant. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (BOM) from three low-hardness surface waters
   was isolated and concentrated using a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane
   system. The efficacy of the RO isolation method and its impact on the
   subsequent reactivity between DOM and chlorine were examined. DOM mass
   balances (quantified as dissolved organic carbon) ranged from 96.1 to
   102.1 \% for the three waters tested, and DOM mass recoveries of 93.9 to
   98.2\% indicated successful isolation, minimal fractionation, and
   negligible loss of organic matter. RO isolates were diluted using
   distilled and deionized water in the laboratory to reconstitute the
   source waters. Both source water (collected at the time of isolation)
   and reconstituted source water samples were chlorinated. Formation of
   several disinfection by-products (DBPs: e.g., THMs. HAA(9), HANs, and
   HKs) were measured. For all waters tested, DBP formation of source and
   corresponding reconstituted source water agreed within 95\% confidence
   intervals. Therefore, RO isolation had no impact on the DOM reactivity
   of the three low-hardness surface water tested in this study. In
   addition, the degree of bromine substitution. as expressed by the
   bromine incorporation factor, was calculated. Comparison of bromine
   incorporation factors for sourer and reconstituted source waters further
   indicated that, as with the total DBP formations, bromine speciation and
   the relative occurrence of individual species in THMs and HAA(9) did not
   change as a result of the isolation. Overall, in terms of DBP formation,
   RO isolation appears to maintain the integrity and reactivity of DOM.

Abstract = {{The steady-state model from Siegrist and Gujer (1994) which can be used
   for the design and optimisation of nitrogen-removing activated sludge
   plants is applied to the stoichiometrics and kinetics of a validated
   Activated Sludge Model No. 3. It considers the wastewater composition,
   the effect of the electron acceptor on the average sludge production,
   the oxygen input into anoxic volumes, denitrification in the secondary
   clarifier, the temperature and various operating conditions. The organic
   substrate for denitrification originates from readily degradable
   substrate from the influent, from the hydrolysis of slowly degradable
   particulate substrate along the activated sludge plant and from the
   endogenous respiration of the biomass. The model is calibrated and
   validated with data from long-term full-scale and pilot-plant
   experiments for Swiss municipal wastewater. The most sensitive
   parameters as well as the uncertainty of the model prognosis for various
   GOD-to-nitrogen ratios from inlet water and anoxic volume fractions were
   calculated with the aid of sensitivity analyses and Monte-Carlo
   simulations. Excel spreadsheets of the model for different flow schemes

Abstract = {{The efficiency of sludge disinfection by irradiation was investigated
   using an electron beam accelerator, with the Ascaris ovum as a model.
   Ova suspensions prepared by worm dissection, immediately after
   preparation and after storage at 4 degreesC for 2 months were tested.
   Suspensions of ova extracted from slaughterhouse sludge were also
   tested. The ova were irradiated in sludge to determine, by probit
   analysis, the dose that inactivated 90\% of viable ova. The D-10 values
   obtained for irradiation of residual sludge contaminated with ova
   depended on the source of the ova, the D-10 values were 788 +/- 172Gy
   for suspensions of ova extracted from slaughterhouse sludge and 1125 +/-
   145Gy for suspensions freshly prepared by dissection. Ova suspensions
   freshly prepared by dissection were more proof against irradiation.
   Similarly, the D-10 value was affected by storage: 1125 +/- 145Gy for
   freshly produced ova suspensions and 661 +/- 45Gy for suspensions of ova
   stored for 2 months at 4 degreesC in deionized water. The medium in
   which the ova were irradiated (deionized water or sludge) also affected
   D-10 values, the indirect effects were smaller in samples of
   contaminated sludge which were rich in organic matter, with the action
   of the radiation being mostly direct. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{It was examined, whether methane call be used as hydrogen donor for an
   in situ denitrification of groundwater. It is demonstrated, that
   groundwater can sen e as liquid medium and that the denitrification can
   occur at 10 degreesC. Efforts to enrich methanotrophic bacteria under
   anoxic conditions have not been successful. No methane oxidation
   occurred in the absence of oxygen. For this reason, the denitrification
   with methane must be performed in a two-stage process with aerobic
   methanotrophic bacteria producing metabolites, that are used as hydrogen
   donor by non-methanotrophic bacteria in anoxic areas. This kind of
   indirect denitrification was proved by quantifying nitrogen and nitrous
   oxide in enrichment cultures that were not stirred or shaken, Large
   numbers of non-methanotrophic bacteria being able to denitrify with
   methanol, acetate or proteins as sole hydrogen donor were enriched
   besides the methanotrophic bacteria under these conditions. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The determination of residence time is of major interest in terms of the
   characterisation, design and modelling of most environmental engineering
   processes, where a proper and homogeneous fluid distribution is often
   essential, and especially in the domain of wastewater or waste material
   treatment. In this paper, two different numerical methods for obtaining
   theoretical predictions of residence time distributions using the finite
   volume method apr used. The first one consists of solving a transport
   equation of the local mean age of the fluid, which is the average time
   that a fluid particle takes to reach any point of the domain from a
   supply inlet. The result obtained is a spatial distribution of the local
   mean are of the fluid, which may he displayed as isocontours in the
   space domain considered. The second one consists of injecting a virtual
   particle stream (i.e, a fluid particle having the same density as the
   surrounding fluid, and treated numerically as a tracer) and measuring
   the time elapsed between the injection and the termination or the
   trajectory using a Lagrangian reference frame. The result obtained is
   expressed as an exit time distribution and may be displayed as a
   histogram. Finally, a comparison with measurements of mean residence
   times of tracers in a lagoon is made in order to establish the relevance
   of this method in concrete form. The prediction enables the
   instantaneous determination of the geometrical characteristics of the
   flow that contribute actually to the residence time dispersion, its
   appropriate use prior to the design of water treatment and waste
   material treatment installations should contribute to prevent
   undesirable flow patterns such as short-circuiting and dead spaces. (C)

Abstract = {{This research analyses the accumulation and degradation of poly-beta
   -hydroxybutyrate (PHB) in experiments with pulse addition of acetate to
   samples of activated sludge from pilot-plant and full-scale wastewater
   treatment plants. The experiments are divided into two periods: a feast
   period defined as the time when acetate is consumed and a famine period
   when the added acetate has been exhausted. In the feast period the
   significant process occurring is the production of PHB from acetate. The
   produced PHB is utilised in the famine period for production of glycogen
   and biomass. According to modelling results approximately 90\% of the
   total potential growth occurs in the famine period utilising the stored
   PHB. The degradation rate for PHB in the famine period is found to be
   dependent on the level of PHB obtained at the end of the feast period.
   It was found that multiple order kinetics gives a goad description of
   the rate of PHB degradation. The examined sludge of low SRT origin is
   found to degrade PHB faster than long SRT sludge at high fractions of
   PHB. The observed yield of glycogen on PHB in the famine period is in
   the range of 0.22-0.33 g COD/g COD depending on the SRT. The storage
   pool of glycogen in the examined sludge is mon slowly degraded than PHB
   (COD/COD/h). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to examine the catalyzed decomposition of
   hydrogen peroxide and 2-chlorophenol (2-CP) in the presence of iron
   oxides. C;ranular ferrihydrite, goethite, and hematite were selected as
   catalysts in this study. 2-CP was used as the model compound because it
   is a typical toxic compound and has not been investigated in the
   catalytic decomposition by iron oxides. The catalytic activity for
   hydrogen peroxide decomposition followed the sequence: granular
   ferrihydrite > goethite > hematite. However, hematite exhibited the
   highest activity in catalyzing 2-CP oxidation. The oxidation efficiency
   of 2-CP corresponded with the inverse sequence of specific area and
   pH,,, of the iron oxides. The catalytic activity of granular
   ferrihydrite was affected significantly by the mixing speed and particle
   size for its large value of Thiele modulus (phi) and Damkohler number
   (Da). The strong diffusion resistance for granular ferrihydrite was
   attributed either to its microporous structure or to the formation of
   oxygen in the pores of the iron oxide leading to the unexpected
   catalytic activity of granular ferrihydrite to hydrogen peroxide and
   2-CP. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of ferrous iron and pH on carbon tetrachloride degradation by
   Methanosarcina thermophila}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2307-2313}},

Abstract = {{The influence of environmental conditions on the biological
   transformation of a contaminant must be well understood to optimize
   remediation processes. One factor that impacts the biological
   transformation of carbon tetrachloride (CT) is elemental iron (Fe-0).
   Previous research has shown that Fe-0 increases the methanogenic CT
   degradation rate by providing H-2 for cell growth and dechlorination. As
   Fe-0 oxidizes it also increases the pH and Fe2+ levels, which may also
   impact the biological transformation of CT. Experiments were performed
   with Methanosarcina thermophila to investigate the influence of these
   factors on CT degradation. The transformation of CT and CF was greatly
   influenced by pH, with the rate of CT and CF degradation increasing with
   increasing pH. After 6 h, > 90\% of the CT had been degraded in the
   treatments containing cells at a FH of 8.5, whereas only about 51\% of
   the CT had been degraded in similar treatments at a pH of.5.5. Fe2+ did
   not significantly influence the degradation of CT; however, 60\% less CF
   was formed in systems containing cells + Fe2+ than in systems containing
   cells only. In addition, Fe2+ prolnoted rapid transformation of CF when
   added to treatments containing cells. The product distribution after 9
   days in all systems containing cells was very similar, with 98.04 +/-
   5.46\% (two-sided 95\% confidence interval) of the originally fed CT
   present as soluble products. These results show that pH and Fe2+
   influence the degradation of CT and CF, although transiently. Because
   the residence time of contaminants in Fe-0 barriers varies with the
   thickness of the barrier, it is likely that this influence will be
   important for some Bow-through systems. This implies that a combined
   Fe-0/organism remediation system may have previously unrealized
   advantages (due to pH and Fe2+ changes). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The levels of trace metals and organochlorine residue were determined in
   red mullet (Mullus barbatus) in the framework of a MED-POL II Project
   for the Aegean Sea during 1991-1998. Samples were analyzed seasonally
   from July 1994 to January 1998. The concentrations of trace metals found
   varied with Hg: 16-200 mug kg(-1), Cd: 0.57-4.5 mug kg(-1) and Pb:
   40-207 mug kg(-1) wet weight. The order of trace metal concentrationn
   found in Mullus barbatus was Pb > Hg > Cd. Correlation coefficients were
   calculated between Hg, Cd, and Pb concentrations and fork lengths to be
   Hg:0.5852, Cd:-0.081, Pb:0.5823, respectively. Cadmium levels are lower
   than the results in fish tissues reported from Mediterranean regions.
   The results of organochlorine residues measured varied between Aldrin:
   0.10 and 0.61 mug kg(-1) t-DDD: 0.86 and 4.5 mug kg(-1) and t-DDE: 10
   and 18 mug kg(-1) wet weight. Correlation coefficients for measured
   organochlorine residues and fork lengths are Aldrin: 0.6422, t-DDD:
   0.2237 and t-DDE: 0.5484. The levels of mercury, lead and organochlorine
   residues are similar to the results in fish from Mediterranean

Abstract = {{The sanitary regulations introduce a requirement for parasitological
   control of sewage water used for irrigation and fertilisation of crops..
   The existing methods of estimation of helminth eggs, based on the
   coproscopic method using sedimentation, desorption, centrifugation and
   flotation of the material: allow for only 30-75\% efficiency. The aim of
   this paper is to present an improved quantitative estimation method. The
   proposed method is based on an internal standard. A predetermined number
   of eggs of Ascaris lumbricoides suis L is coloured with crystalline
   violet. These marked eggs are added to sample being examined. Counting
   the marked eggs in the sample and comparing them with their introduced
   number allows to estimate the efficiently of the procedure. This results
   in an increase in the efficiency of the method to 100\%. It is possible
   to calculate the real number of helminth eggs in the sample on the basis
   of the estimated efficiency of the procedure, The sensitivity of the
   proposed method is at the level of about 0.4 ppm. The necessary number
   of replications in the method is about 10 times lower than that in the
   existing methods. The number of natural (not coloured) eggs does not
   influence the efficiency of the method with an internal standard. (C)

Abstract = {{A novel water duality index, the mutagen formation potential (MFP) is
   proposed for use in evaluation of the quality of drinking water which
   may contain pollutants capable of forming mutagens when chlorinated
   under the conditions used in water purification processes. A method for
   measuring MFP was established as follows. The water sample to be tested
   is diluted until the TOC reaches 3-4 mg l(-1), the pH is adjusted to 7.0
   +/- 0.2, sodium hypochlorite is added to obtain conditions where Cl/TOC
   = 3-4 mg Cl (mg C)(-1) and the water sample is left standing for 24 +/-
   2 h at room temperature. Thereafter, 21 of the chlorinated water sample
   at pH 2.0 +/- 0.1 is passed through a Sep-Pak Plus CSP-800 cartridge to
   adsorb ally mutagens formed, and DMSO is applied to the cartridge to
   desorb the mutagens. Then, a 2 mi sample of the eluate is collected
   after the DMSO had begun to flow out of the cartridge and evaluated by
   the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay (preincubation method). (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Ozonation is a disinfection technique commonly used in the treatment of
   drinking water. It destroys harmful microbes. but it also degrades
   organic matter in water, increasing the bioavailability of organic
   matter. Recently. it was found that not only organic carbon bur also
   phosphorus can limit the microbial growth in drinking water, which
   contains high amount of organic matter. We used a bioassay to analyze
   whether ozone could also increase the microbially available phosphorus
   (MAP) in drinking water, and whether MAP in ozone-treated water was
   associated with the growth of heterotrophic microbes. We found that both
   assimilable organic carbon and MAP concentrations were increased by
   ozone treatment. In ozonated water, microbial growth was mainly limited
   by phosphorus. and even minor changes in MAP concentration dramatically
   increased the growth potential of heterotrophic microbes. In this study,
   ozonation increased the MAP by 0.08-0.73 mug P/l, resulting in an
   increase of 80,000-730,000 CFU/ml in water samples, In contrast to MAP.
   the content of assimilable organic carbon (AOC(potential)) did not
   correlate with microbial growth. The results show that in water
   treatment not only AOC(potential) but also MAP should be considered as
   an important factor that can limit microbial growth in drinking water.

Abstract = {{A nested-PCR assay, incorporating an internal positive control, was
   developed for Cryptosporidium monitoring in finished water. This assay
   was capable of reproducibly detecting 8 oocysts in spiked-filtered water
   samples collected from 5 South Australian water treatment plants. The
   RT-PCR assay of Kaucner and Stinear (Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 64(5)
   (1998) 1743) was also evaluated for the detection of Cryptosporidium
   parvum. initially, under our experimental conditions, a detection level
   of 27 oocysts was achieved for spiked reagent water samples. This level
   was improved to 5 oocysts by modification of the method. Untreated South
   Australian source waters concentrated by calcium carbonate flocculation
   were found to be highly inhibitory to the RT-PCR assay. Concentration of
   similar samples using Envirochek filters appeared to eliminate PCR
   inhibition. While both methods possessed similar sensitivities the
   nested-PCR assay was more reproducible, more cost effective, simpler to
   perform and could detect both viable and non-viable intact
   Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts, which is an important consideration for
   plant operators. These factors make the nested-PCR assay the method of
   choice for screening large numbers of potable water samples, where a
   reliable low level of detection is essential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Microbial biomass in wastewater was determined by methods used in
   environmental microbiology and by a method used in wastewater
   engineering based on a conceptual model simulating fundamental microbial
   processes in wastewater from measured oxygen uptake rates. The methods
   originating from environmental microbiology are based on staining and
   counting of cells for the determination of total cell biomass (acridine
   orange and DAPI), physiological state of cells (LIVE: DEAD(R)
   BacLight(TM) and activity of cells (reduction of the redox dye CTC and
   microautoradiography). Depending on the staining method applied, cell
   biomasses yielded 15-86\% of the biomass defined by the model, and good
   correlations between cell biomass and model biomass were found. Cell
   biomass, oxygen uptake and acetate uptake were measured in wastewater,
   where acetate was added. Substrate uptake rates were found not to be
   proportional to the increases in cell biomass, suggesting that only a
   small fraction of the cell biomass was responsible for the main part of
   the substrate uptake. Despite the differences found between cell biomass
   and model biomass, it was recommended to use the conceptual model as an
   engineering tool for simulation of microbial processes and wastewater
   quality changes. However, there should be a clear distinction between
   the terms `model biomass','cell biomass' and different activity
   measurements of cells. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   along with naturally occurring particulate arsenic predominantly by
   clarification. Soluble As(III) tracks through the treatment processes
   and is converted to soluble As(V) during final chlorination. The ability

Abstract = {{Aerobic degradation of ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE), Methyl tert-butyl
   ether (MTBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME), as tertiary-substrates,
   was studied in a continuous upflow fixed-bed reactor (UFBR) using an
   external oxygenator and sintered glass rings as biomass carriers. The
   UFBR has been shown to be an effective system for the simultaneous and
   continuous long-term degradation of the three-oxygenates mixture as sole
   source of carbon and energy. Therefore, the oxygenates feed
   concentration must be related in conjunction with the hydraulic
   retention time ``HRT{''} and vice versa. The permissible feed
   concentration of both MTBE and TAME to achieve more than 99\% removal
   efficiency is about 80 mg L-1 at a constant HRT of 24 h. The same
   performance can be obtained if the HRT kept at a value equal or above to
   15 h for a feed concentration of about 80 mg L-1 of both MTBE and TAME.
   However, the ETBE removal efficiency was always greater than 99\%
   whatever the ETBE concentration feed (between 10 and 100 mg L-1 at a
   constant HRT of 24 h) and the HRT (between 24 and 13 h at a constant
   concentration feed of about 80 mg L-1) tested in this study. The highest
   ETBE, MTBE and TAME removal rates achieved throughout the UFBR runs,
   with efficiency better than 99\%, were 140 +/- 5, 132 +/- 2 and 135 +/-
   2 mg L-1 d(-1), respectively. No metabolic intermediates including
   tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), tert-butyl formate (TBF) and tert-amyl alcohol
   (TAA) were detected in the effluent during all the reactor runs.
   Furthermore, based on the chemical oxygen demand balance, all the
   removed oxygenates were completely metabolized. The results of this
   study suggest that the higher resistance to biodegradation exhibited by
   the MTBE and the TAME is probably due to the steric hindrance for the
   attacking enzyme(s); and the major limiting step to the oxygenate
   degradation maybe the accessibility and the cleavage of the ether bond,
   but not the assimilation of their major metabolites such as TEA, TBF and
   TAA. These results were concomitant with the batch tests using the
   reactor's immobilized biomass as inoculum. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Concern about the overall management of lakes has been growing, and a
   lake ecological model provides the guidelines necessary for such
   management. In this study, an ecological model describing the ecosystem
   of the Keszthely Basin, Lake Balaton, Hungary, one of the typical
   shallow and eutrophic lakes, was proposed. This model includes three
   types of zooplankton and two types of fish as well as two types of algae
   and nutrients. Parameters concerning the algae and fish were estimated
   based on observations in the basin between 1991 and 1995. The other
   parameters and the structure of the model were determined by our
   previous study. The parameters of the model were calibrated with the
   Monte Carlo technique, and its predictability was confirmed. The effects
   on the basin's ecosystem of three restorative manipulations, namely a
   biomanipulation, reduction of loading phosphorus, and dredging the
   sediment, were assessed by simulation studies using the proposed model.
   The simulation results indicated that a biomanipulation that removed
   90\% of the bream should suppress the growth of algae temporarily
   through bottom-up regulation; however, this effect seemed to not be
   perpetuated in this basin. The reduction of loading phosphorus seemed to
   be the most effective means to suppress algal growth, while dredging of
   sediment seemed to be the most desirable restoration method from the
   standpoint of the overall management of the lake, because it was
   expected to accelerate the growth of fish population as well as to
   suppress algal growth. Furthermore, the algal growth suppresion
   mechanism of the dredging was disccused on the basis of the model
   calculations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A diagnostic probe was used to estimate the activity of Fenton-derived
   hydroxyl radicals (. OH), reaction kinetics, and oxidation efficiency in
   batch suspensions comprised of silica sand, crushed goethite (alpha
   -FeOOH) ore, peat, and H2O2 (0.13 mM). A simple method of kinetic
   analysis is presented and used to estimate the rate of . OH production
   (P-OH) and scavenging term (k(s)), which were used to establish the
   influence of organic matter (Pahokee peat) in Fenton systems. P-OH was
   greater in the peal-amended systems than in the unamended control, and
   ics was approximately the same. Any increase in scavenging of . OH that
   resulted from the addition of peat was insignificant in comparison to
   radical scavenging by reaction with H2O2. Also, treatment efficiency,
   defined as the ratio of probe conversion to H2O2 consumption over the
   same period was greater in the peat-amended system. Results suggest that
   OH production is enhanced in the presence of peat by one or more
   pear-dependent mechanisms. Fe concentration and availability in the
   pear, reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) by the organic matter, and
   reduction of organic-complexed Fe(III) to Fe(II) are discussed in the
   context of the Fenton mechanism. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The degradation of the herbicide isoproturon during its ozonation in
   aqueous solution has been investigated with the aim of identifying
   intermediate as well as final by-products formed. Ar ambient
   temperature, phosphate-buffered (pH = 7) isoproturon aqueous solutions
   (10, 10(-1) and 10(-3) mg/l) were ozonated in a semi-batch reactor,
   under a continuous flow of ozonated air whose ozone concentration was 9
   and 0.9 O-3/l(air),for the highest and the two lower herbicide
   concentrations respectively. Measured steady-state ozone concentrations
   during the two sets of experiments (i.e. the highest and the lower
   isoproturon concentration) were 1.9 and 0.7 mg O-3/l. Under all of the
   above conditions. isoproturon was always completely removed in a period
   ranging between 5 and 15 min, essentially by reacting with molecular
   ozone. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (HPLC-MS) analyses indicate that primary degradation by-products are
   formed either by introducing OH groups in the aromatic ring and/or in
   the side-chain substituents. or by breaking down the isopropyl alkyl
   chain. The results also show that these primary intermediates are
   successively degraded yielding low molecular weight compounds such as
   aldehydes, simple organic acids and alpha -oxo-acids, which have been
   identified by gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD),
   ion chromatography (IC) and GC-MSI respectively. On the basis of the
   analytical results, a pathway for the degradation of isoproturon by
   ozone has been proposed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ali rights

Abstract = {{After a previous study in which the considered oxidant was ozone (Part
   I), a laboratory investigation has been carried out to study the
   degradation of the herbicide isoproturon during its reaction with
   another oxidant. i.e, chlorine, in aqueous solution (Part II; this
   paper). The specific aim was to identify the by-products formed. The
   effects of pH and the presence of bromide ions were studied. Reactions
   have been carried out at room temperature, in phosphate buffered aqueous
   solutions, at four pHs (6, 7, 8 and 9), By-products identification was
   first performed using relatively high initial reagent concentrations
   which were analytically convenient ({[}isoproturon] = 40 mg/l, {[}HClO +
   ClO-] = 160 mg Cl/l, {[}Br-] = 80 mg/l). In follow-up studies, the
   by-products identified during this preliminary step were searched for
   when using concentration values closer to those actually encountered at
   real water treatment plants ({[}isoproturon] = 0.4 and 0.004 mg/l,
   {[}HClO + ClO-] = 1.6 mg Cl/l, {[}Br-] = 0.8 and 0.008 mg/l). Under all
   of the studied conditions, the results showed that isoproturon is
   completely degraded and that it decays much faster in the presence of
   bromide. The pH has a negligible influence when bromide ions are absent.
   On the contrary, if bromide ions are present, the isoproturon decay is
   slower at higher pH values. High performance liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analyses have led to the identification of
   several by-products as a result of simultaneous oxidation and
   substitution reactions, both occurring on the aromatic ring of the
   herbicide. However, the more abundant by-products are those resulting
   from the oxidation of the isoproturon aromatic ring. As far as
   halogenated by-products are concerned, the higher the bromide ion
   concentration the higher the ratio of brominated to chlorinated
   by-products. On the basis of the analytical results, a pathway for
   isoproturon degradation under the studied conditions is proposed, (C)

Abstract = {{High strength domestic wastewater discharges after no/partial treatment
   through sewage treatment plants or septic tank seepage held systems have
   resulted in a large build-up of groundwater nitrates in Rajasthan,
   India. The groundwater table is very deep and nitrate concentrations of
   500-750 mg/l (113-169) as NO3--N) are commonly found. A novel biofilm
   ill a 3-stage lab-scale rotating biological contactor (RBC) was
   developed by the incorporation of a sulphur oxidising bacterium
   Thiosphaera pantotropha which exhibited high simultaneous removal of
   carbon and nitrogen in Fully aerobic conditions. T. pantotropha has been
   shown to be capable of simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and
   aerobic denitrification thereby helping the steps of carbon oxidation,
   nitrification and denitrification to be carried out concurrently. The
   first stage having T. pantotropha dominated biofilm showed high carbon
   and NH4+-N removal rates of 8.7-25.9 g COD/m(2) d and 0.81-1.85 g N/m(2)
   d for the corresponding loadings of 10.0-32.0 g COD/m(2) d and 1.0-3.35
   g N/m(2) d. The ratio of carbon removed to nitrogen removed was close to
   12.0. The nitrification rate increased from 0.81 to 1.8 g N/m(2) d with
   the increasing nitrogen loading rates despite a high simultaneous
   organic loading rate. However, it fell to 1.53 g N/m(2) d at a high load
   of 3.35 g N/m(2) d and 32 g COD/m(2) d showing a possible inhibition of
   the process. A simultaneous 44-63\% removal of nitrogen was also
   achieved without any significant NO2--N or NO3--N build-up. The second
   and third stages. almost devoid of any organic carbon, acted only as
   autotrophic nitrification units, converting the NH4+ -N from stage 1 to
   nitrite and nitrate. Such a system would not need a separate carbon
   oxidation step to increase nitrification rates and no external carbon
   source for denitrification, The alkalinity compensation during
   denitrification for that destroyed in nitrification may also result in a
   high economy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Development of a granular sludge with high strength, high biological
   activity and a narrow settling distribution is necessary for optimal
   operation of high-rate upflow anaerobic treatment systems. Several
   studies have compared granules produced from different wastewaters but
   these have largely been from laboratory-fed reactors or compared
   granules from full-scale reactors fed similar wastewater types. Though
   two authors have commented on the inferiority of granules produced by a
   protein-based feed, the properties of these granules have not been
   characterised. In this paper, granules from full-scale reactors treating
   fruit and vegetable cannery effluent, two brewery effluents and a pig
   abattoir (slaughterhouse) were compared in terms of basic composition,
   size distribution, density, settling velocity, shear strength, and EPS
   content. The results supported previous qualitative observations by
   other researchers that indicate granule properties depend more on
   wastewater type rather than reactor design or operating conditions such
   as pre-acidification level. The cannery-fed granules bad excellent shear
   strength, settling distribution and density. Granules from the two
   brewery-fed reactors had statistically the same bulk properties, which
   were still acceptable for upflow applications. The protein-grown granule
   had poor strength and settling velocity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Water distributed from the Wanneroo Groundwater Treatment Plant
   intermittently contains dimethyl trisulphide (DMTS). The compound is
   responsible for a ``swampy odour{''} in the water. DMTS production from
   potential precursors was insignificant in the absence of biofilms when
   compared with DMTS production from precursors in the presence of
   biofilms in a biofilm reactor. Greatest dimethyl disulphide (DMDS) and
   DMTS production (> 3000 ng L-1 DMTS) occurred in the reactors when
   supplied with methane thio-containing compounds, such as methionine,
   S-methyl cysteine and methyl-3-(methylmercapto)-propionate, Abiotic DMTS
   production from oligosulphides also occurred through the addition of the
   methylating agents, methyl iodide or methyl-p-toluene sulphonate.
   Significant DMTS production also occurred with Wanneroo water that
   contained added omega -thio-containing compounds such as cysteine (1400
   ng L-1 DMTS), and 3-mercaptopropionate (210 ng L-1). Biomethylation, a
   ubiquitous response by microorganisms for the detoxification of toxic
   compounds, generated DMDS/TS from biofilm oligosulphides. Biofilms
   exposed to the toxic compounds selenate or 2,4,6-trichlorophenol
   methylated oligosulphides in addition to the toxins. Sodium sulphide
   also stimulated DMTS production. Easily Biodegradable Dissolved Organic
   Carbon (BDOC) probably contributed indirectly to DMTS production by the
   biofilms, although whether this was a result of its stimulation of
   greater microbial activity or consumption of oxygen, or both, remains
   unresolved. Stagnation of water in the biofilm reactors also increased
   DMTS production, which was concomitant with depletion of oxygen
   concentrations in the bulk water. Many processes, such as degradation of
   methane thio-containing compounds, methylation of sulphides and
   oligosulphides, and changes in contributions of different metabolic
   pathways upon depletion of oxygen concentrations upon water stagnation,
   probably contribute simultaneously to ``swampy odour{''} production in
   the distribution system. Crown Copyright (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel anaerobic treatment system, the anaerobic migrating blanket
   reactor (AMBR), was developed after completing a parallel study with
   upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) and anaerobic sequencing batch
   reactor (ASBR) processes. Using sucrose as the main component of a
   synthetic wastewater, the AMBR achieved a maximum chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) loading rate of 30 g.l(-1).day(-1) at a 12-h hydraulic retention
   time (HRT). This resulted in a standard methane production rate (SMPR)
   of 6.5 l.l(-1).day(-1) and an average methane-based COD (MCOD) removal
   efficiency of 62.2\%. A key element in granular biomass formation was
   migration of the biomass blanket through the reactor. Although a
   carbohydrate-rich wastewater was used, no separate pre-acidification was
   required for the AMBR, because of high mixing intensities and wash out
   of acidogenic bacteria. In contrast, the absence of pre-acidification
   created ``bulking{''} problems (caused by abundant acidogenic bacteria
   at the surface of granules) in a UASB reactor, operated under conditions
   similar to that of the AMBR. As a result, a maximum COD loading rate and
   SMPR of 21 g.l(-1).day(-1) and 4.9 l.l(-1).day(-1) were achieved,
   respectively, for the UASB reactor at a 12-h HRT. These values were 18
   g.l(-1).day(-1) and 3.7 l.l(-1).day(-1), respectively, for an ASBR at a
   12-h HRT. Hence, the performance of the AMBR in treating a
   carbohydrate-rich wastewater was found to be superior in terms of
   maximum loading rate and SMPR. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Denitrification is known as an essential part of a biological nutrient
   removal (BNR) process to remove nitrogen and it also affects phosphorus
   removal. However, an accurate prediction of nitrogen removal is
   extremely difficult because there are too marry factors involved. This
   study was conducted to find a relationship between nitrate uptake rate
   (NUR) and carbonaceous oxygen uptake rate (OUR) and develop a simple
   method to predict applicable NUR for the design of various BNR
   processes. Sewage was subdivided into soluble and particulate organic
   fractions. NUR/OUR ratios were measured by respirometer with these
   organic fractions and the rest sludges grown at various BNR processes
   and temperatures. NUR/OUR ratios were varied with the types of organic
   fractions of sewage and temperature. The NURs predicted from the NUR/OUR
   ratios and computed OUR based on the total tank volume of anoxic and
   oxic stages with the influent sewage characteristics were very much
   comparable with the observed NURs from various BNR processes. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{In this project we studied the microbiological quality of soft pipeline
   deposits removed from drinking water distribution networks during

   from 16 drinking water distribution networks located at eight towns in
   different parts of Finland. Soft pipeline deposits were found to be the
   key site for microbial growth in the distribution networks. The
   microbial numbers in the soft deposits were significantly higher than
   numbers in running water. The highest microbial numbers were detected in
   the main deposit pushed ahead by the first swab. The deposits contained
   high numbers of heterotrophic bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. Also
   coliform bacteria were often isolated from deposit samples. Manganese
   and copper in the deposits correlated negatively with the numbers of
   heterotrophic bacteria. After a year, the viable microbial numbers in
   the new deposits were almost as high as in the old deposits before the
   first mechanical cleaning. The bacterial biomass production was higher
   in the new than in the old deposits. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Chloramines have long been used to provide a disinfecting residual in
   distribution systems where it is difficult to maintain a free chlorine
   residual or where disinfection by-product (DBP) formation is of concern.
   While chloramines are generally considered less reactive than free
   chlorine, they are inherently unstable even in the absence of reactive
   substances. These reactions, often referred to as
   ``auto-decomposition{''}, always occur and hence define the maximum
   stability of monochloramine in water. The effect of additional reactive
   material must be measured relative to this basic loss process. A
   thorough understanding of the auto-decomposition reactions is
   fundamental to the development of mechanisms that account for reactions
   with additional substances and to the ultimate formation of DBPs. A
   kinetic model describing auto-decomposition was recently developed. This
   model is based on studies of isolated individual reactions and on
   observations of the reactive ammonia-chlorine system as a whole. The
   work presented here validates and extends this model for use in waters
   typical of those encountered in distribution systems and under realistic
   chloramination conditions. The effect of carbonate and temperature on
   auto-decomposition is discussed. The influence of bromide and nitrite at
   representative monochloramine concentrations is also examined, and
   additional reactions to account for their influence on monochloramine
   decay are presented to demonstrate the ability of the model to
   incorporate inorganic demand pathways that occur parallel to
   auto-decomposition. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A version of the orthophthaldialdehyde-fluorescence ammonium
   determination for flow injection analysis (FIA) is presented here, with
   a view to its use for in situ, low-power consumption systems, Thus, the
   reaction temperature was limited to 30 degreesC and FIA was used in
   stop-Bow mode (3 min stop). The calibration is linear up to 50 mu mol
   l(-1), but concentrations up to 100 mu mol l(-1) can be measured.
   Repeatability is around 1\% in the range of 0.5-4 mu mol l(-1) and the
   detection limit is about 0.03 mu mol l(-1) Over the salinity range of
   5-35 (seawater practical salinity scale) the salt effect is almost
   negligible (within +/- 2\%); and below salinity of 5 it increases to a
   maximum of -9\% in fresh water compared to seawater. Hydrogen carbonate,
   dissolved oxygen and turbidity (either suspended sediments or
   phytoplankton cells) have almost no adverse effect in a wide range of
   concentrations, covering most natural water conditions. Relative
   interference of primary amines is negligible and mercury (a common
   sample preservative) does not depress the signal up to 20 mg l(-1) Hg
   II. Sulfide, that may be present in areas with anoxic waters, depresses
   the signal only slightly and linearly (-9\% at 100 mu mol l(-1) S2-).
   The method appears to be convenient for the determination of ammonium in
   most coastal, estuarine and fresh waters. Sample throughput is 9 h(-1).
   The performance of the method can be improved, either by increasing the
   reaction time (low throughput) or, if enough energy is available, by
   increasing the reaction temperature (non-stop-flow mode, high
   throughput). Combining FIA and fluorometry appears to be interesting for
   in situ determination (submersible devices) of dissolved compounds in
   environments with variable salinity and turbidity (especially coastal
   and estuarine waters). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   and 7.7 h for OP. Parallel to the laboratory experiments, field survey
   on the chemicals contamination for water and ayu fish (Plecoglossus
   altivelis) from rivers flowing into Lake Biwa was performed. The
   contamination was not so high in agreement with the laboratory

Abstract = {{Interaction between Hg(II) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected
   from surface water samples of the Florida Everglades was studied using
   different fluorescence spectroscopic methods. Complexation between
   Hg(II) and DOM leached from mangrove leaves, sawgrass, and periphyton
   was investigated. Both fluorescence emission and synchronous
   fluorescence spectra showed that these dissolved organic materials,
   whether they are highly degraded or are freshly leached, can
   ``complex{''} Hg(II) since fluorescence intensity was quenched upon
   addition of Hg(II) to the DOM samples. Synchronous fluorescence spectra
   disclosed structural information on the DOM sample, regarding possible
   binding sites for Hg(II). Chemical parameters on the complexation of
   Hg(II), including the conditional stability constants and the percentage
   of fluorophores participating in the complexation, were estimated by the
   modified Stern-Volmer equation. A detailed investigation under different
   experimental conditions showed that the complexation of the DOM samples
   collected from the Everglades was influenced by pH, Cl-(aq)(-) anion,
   and cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+. Experimental results suggest that
   DOM-Hg(II) complexes run be removed from the water column through
   adsorption on biogenically precipitated CaCO3(s). (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The feasibility of codigestion of the organic fraction of municipal
   solid waste, primary sludge, and waste activated sludge was evaluated in
   mesophilic (37 degreesC), laboratory-scale digesters. In a first
   experiment, different startup strategies were compared using foul
   digesters, operated under continuously mixed conditions. After two
   weeks, the experiment was continued under minimally mixed conditions.
   Results demonstrated that reducing the level of mixing improved digester
   performance. Therefore, in a second experiment, six digesters were
   operated to compare performance under continuous mixing and reduced
   mixing levels at various loading rates and solids levels. The
   continuously mixed digesters exhibited unstable performance at the
   higher loading rates, while the minimally mixed digesters performed well
   for all loading rates evaluated. In a third experiment, it was
   demonstrated that an unstable, continuously mixed digester was quickly
   stabilized by reducing the mixing level. These experiments confirmed
   that continuous mixing was not necessary for good performance and was
   inhibitory at higher loading rates. In addition, reduction of mixing
   levels may he used as an operational tool to stabilize unstable
   digesters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial population dynamics were evaluated in anaerobic codigesters
   treating municipal solid waste and sewage sludge. Ribosomal RNA based
   oligonucleotide probes were used to characterize changes in population
   abundance of syntrophic volatile fatty acid degrading bacteria and
   methanogens. Changes in community structure were linked to traditional
   performance parameters during the recovery of previously unstable
   codigesters induced by a reduction in mixing levels. Methanosarcina spp.
   were the most abundant aceticlastic methanogens in unstable codigesters
   with high acetate concentrations, while Methanosaeta concilii was
   dominant in stable systems with low levels of acetate. Growth of
   Syntrophobacter wolinii was enhanced during stabilization of a
   codigester with a well-developed population of Methanobacteriaceae,
   possibly because the presence of adequate numbers of these
   hydrogenotrophic methanogens encouraged the syntrophic oxidation of
   propionate, Mesophilic saturated fatty acid beta-oxidizing syntrophs
   were most abundant in previously unstable codigesters. One minimally
   mixed reactor became unstable after switching to continuously mixed
   conditions. After the switch, total archaeal abundance decreased
   sharply, though Methanobacteriaceae and Methanosarcina spp. levels
   increased as the fermentation became unbalanced. Based on the results
   presented here, mixing appears to inhibit the syntrophic oxidation of
   volatile fatty acids, possibly by disrupting the spatial juxtaposition
   of syntrophic bacteria and their methanogenic partners. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{In this article the role of hydrogen as a process monitoring tool in
   methanogenic systems was studied by considering the influence of several
   key system parameters. Hydrogen production was found to be influenced
   mainly by the inocula's source pH, and varied only slightly with
   external pH and HCO3- levels. When an inoculum adapted to above neutral
   conditions (pH > 7) was shocked, reducing equivalents were selectively
   channelled through formate, while high hydrogen production was noticed
   with acidically (pH < 6.5) adapted inocula. The results also revealed
   that the production of hydrogen or formate during shock loads was not
   strongly associated with microbial morphology (granules or flocs) as
   high electron fluxes were possible through either during acidogenesis.
   Shock load experiments in continuous reactors revealed that neither
   hydrogen nor formate accumulated to any significant degree, nevertheless
   digester recovery took a long time due to the slow kinetics of volatile
   fatty acid degradation. Selective formate production under neutral pH
   environments, coupled with high hydrogenotrophic activity, was found to
   be responsible for the dampened hydrogen response during the early
   phases of gradually shocked systems (step change). Based on these
   results it appears that the role of hydrogen as a process monitoring
   tool has been overemphasised in the literature. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A novel method based on UV absorbance, is presented for estimating the
   BOD5 in pulp and paper mill effluent. This method could eventually be
   incorporated into an on-line sensor for BOD5 that is suitable for
   process control applications. Two streams, the reactor entrance and the
   final effluent, from two different mills were studied. One mill employed
   the Kraft pulping process, while the second mill was a thermo-mechanical
   one. The absorbance over the range 200-350 nm showed significant
   differences between the two mills. Because the two mills use very
   distinct processes, separate correlations were used to relate the
   absorbance to the BOD5 for both the mills. Results indicate that
   prediction of reactor entrance BOD5 was reasonable, whereas prediction
   of final effluent BOD5 was inaccurate, for both mills. Also studied was
   the effect of aeration on BOD5 results obtained at low BOD5 values for
   the Kraft mill. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The source of water for Miami-Dade County, Florida is groundwater
   derived from the Biscayne aquifer. The raw water is rich in natural
   organic material producing correspondingly high color levels. Currently,
   breakpoint chlorination is used at the water treatment plant to control
   the color problem. However, this results in the formation of
   disinfection by-products. Proposed alternatives to reduce color and
   avoid by-product formation include the addition of coagulants such as
   ferric chloride and organic polymers, and the operation of the existing
   lime softening process at a higher pH. This study uses jar tests to
   evaluate the relative effectiveness of the proposed alternatives.
   Results indicate that significant color reduction is achieved using the
   existing lime softening process with activated silica coagulant by
   increasing the softening pH to 11 or more. Elevated pH also produced a >
   30\% reduction in total organic carbon. In the presence of higher raw
   water color (greater than or equal to 80 units), the addition of ferric
   chloride as coagulant at dosages of 80 mg/L is recommended. (C) 2001

Pages = {{1855-1859}},

Abstract = {{Evaluated here are the inhibitory effects on blue-green algae
   (Microcystis aeruginosa) produced by nine plant-producing phenols
   (caffeic, p-coumaric, ferulic, protocatechuic, sinapic, syringic, and
   vanillic acids, catechol, and hydroquinone), two plant-produced acids
   (quinic and shikimic acid), phenol, resorcinol, hydroxy hydroquinone,
   and phloroglucinol. Algal assays confirmed growth inhibition of M.
   aeruginosa by polyphenols, i.e., caffeic/protocatechuic acid, catechol,
   hydroquinone, hydroxy hydroquinone. and phloroglucinol, and by phenols
   containing methoxy groups, i.e., vanillic, sinapic, and syringic acids.
   Accordingly, this indicates good feasibility for controlling growth of
   M. aeruginosa using such plant-producing polyphenols and/or phenols as
   additives. A comparison of the inhibitory effects of the polyphenols
   showed that those induced by polyphenols in which phenolic hydroxy
   groups bound a benzene ring at ortho- and/or para-positions to another
   phenolic hydroxy group are stronger than the effects induced by
   polyphenols in which phenolic hydroxy groups are at only meta-positions.
   Experiments showed that the only polyphenols demonstrating significant
   growth inhibition of M. aeruginosa were autoxidized. These results
   suggest that autoxidation of the polyphenols induces inhibitory effects
   by producing polyphenol-autoxidized products such as radicals. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Rules for assessing compliance with percentile standards commonly limit
   the number of exceedances permitted in a batch of samples taken over a
   defined assessment period. Such rules are commonly developed using
   classical statistical methods. Results from alternative Bayesian methods
   are presented (using beta-distributed prior information and a binomial
   likelihood), resulting in ``confidence of compliance{''} graphs. These
   allow simple reading of the consumer's risk and the supplier's risks for
   any proposed rule. The influence of the prior assumptions required by
   the Bayesian technique on the confidence results is demonstrated, using
   two reference priors (uniform and Jeffreys') and also using optimistic
   and pessimistic user-defined priors. All four give less pessimistic
   results than does the classical technique, because interpreting
   classical results as ``confidence of compliance{''} actually invokes a
   Bayesian approach with an extreme prior distribution. Jeffreys' prior is
   shown to be the most generally appropriate choice of prior distribution.
   Cost savings can be expected using rules based on this approach. (C)

   surfactants on the removal of Pb2+ and Cr6+ has also been studied. The
   material exhibits good adsorption capacity and the data follow both
   Freundlich and Langmuir models. Thermodynamic parameters indicate the
   feasibility of the process. Kinetic studies have been performed to
   understand the mechanism of adsorption. Dynamic modelling of lead and
   chromium removal on red mud has been undertaken and found to follow
   first-order kinetics. The rate constant and mass transfer coefficient
   have also been evaluated under optimum conditions of removal in order to
   understand the mechanism. Column studies have been carried out to
   compare these with batch capacities. The recovery of Pb2+ and Cr6+ and
   chemical regenertion of the spent column have also been tried. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A new method for the determination of 1-aminopropan-2-one (APR) in water
   samples was developed. APR was synthesised as its hydrochloride and
   derivatized with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) for determination by
   high-pressure liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection
   (UV-HPLC). APR was determined in water samples at pH 12 using a
   gas-stripping chamber, connected to a cartridge containing DNPH.
   Acidified water samples were injected into the gas-stripping chamber and
   a solution of NaOH added to bring the solution to pH 12. APR was
   volatilised and stripped from solution and passed onto the cartridge
   under a constant stream of nitrogen gas. Gas flow rates were carefully
   controlled to allow maximum contact of APR with DNPH on the cartridge.
   When the reaction time had elapsed, the cartridge was disconnected and
   the derivative eluted with a fixed volume of acetonitrile and injected
   onto the HPLC, where the APR hydrazone was resolved isocratically with a
   mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and water (60:40). The HPLC was
   calibrated using standard solutions of the APR hydrazone. Recoveries of
   APR from standard samples were 90-100\% at the 10 muM level and the
   detection limit for the method was calculated as 18 nM. Detection of APR
   in urine and primary-treated sewage samples (41 nM and 1.225 muM,
   respectively) confirmed the applicability of the technique to analysis
   of environmental samples. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Bioaccumulation of PCDD/F in the foodweb was investigated in the Ya-Er
   Lake area, which was heavily polluted by PCDD/F. The high concentrations
   of PCDD/F in sediment can be transferred and bioaccumulated by aquatic
   organisms and humans through various pathways. Benthonic invertebrate
   animals and aquatic plants with a lot of fibers in the root can
   accumulate PCDD/F from sediment and water. Snail (Bellamya aeruginosa),
   shrimp (Macrobranchium sp.) and freshwater mussel (Acuticosta chinensis
   (Lea)) took up PCDD/F from the water and maintained the emission
   patterns, whereas fish tended to selectively accumulate
   2,3,7,8-substituted isomers. The tissues of fish-eating bird and duck
   (Anas platyrhynchos) were very highly contaminated by PCDD/F due to
   ingestion of fish and other aquatic organisms from sediment. The
   residual concentration in breast milk depended on the original
   concentration of PCDD/F in the food. A resident in Ya-Er Lake area
   showed a daily intake of PCDD/ F of about 9.14 pg TEQ/kg body
   weight/day. This is higher than the tolerable daily intake (TDI) for
   PCDD/F (1 pg TEQ/kg body weight/day), which was recommended by the World

Abstract = {{To evaluate biomass distribution in heterogeneous biofilms from their
   microscope images, it is often necessary to perform image thresholding
   by converting the gray-scale images to binary images consisting of a
   foreground of biomass material and a background of interstitial space.
   The selection of the gray-scale intensity used for thresholding is
   arbitrary but under the control of the operator, which may produce
   unacceptable levels of variability among operators. The quality of
   numerical information extracted from the images is diminished by such
   variability, and it is desirable to fmd a method that improves the
   reproducibility of thresholding operations. Automatic methods of
   thresholding provide this reproducibility, but often at the expense of
   accuracy, as they consistently set thresholds that differ significantly
   from what human operators would choose. The performance of five
   automatic image thresholding algorithms was tested in this study: (1)
   local entropy; (2) joint entropy; (3) relative entropy; (4) Renyi's
   entropy; and (5) iterative selection. Only the iterative selection
   method was satisfactory in that it was consistently setting the
   threshold level near that set manually. The extraction of feature
   information from biofilm images benefits from automatic thresholding and
   can be extended to other fields, such as medical imaging. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Sorption of P to the bed sand medium is a major removal mechanism for P
   in subsurface flow constructed reed beds. Selecting a sand medium with a
   high P-sorption capacity is therefore important to obtain a sustained
   P-removal. The objective of this study was to evaluate the P-removal
   capacities of 13 Danish sands and to relate the removal to their
   physico-chemical characteristics. The P-removal properties were
   evaluated in short-term isotherm batch-experiments as well as in 12-week
   percolation experiments mimicing the P-loading conditions in constructed
   reed bed systems. The P-removal properties of sands of different
   geographical origin varied considerably and the suitability of the sands
   for use as media in constructed reed beds thus differs. The P-removal
   capacity of some sands would be used up after only a few months in
   full-scale systems, whereas that of others would persist for a much
   longer time. The most important characteristic of the sands determining
   their P-removal capacity was their Ca-content. A high Ca content favours
   precipitation with P as sparingly soluble calcium phosphates
   particularly at the slightly alkaline conditions typical of domestic
   sewage. In situations where the wastewater to be treated is more acid,
   the contents of Fe and Al may be more important as the precipitation
   reactions with these ions are favoured at lower pH levels. The maximum
   P-sorption capacities estimated using the Langmuir-isotherm plots did
   not correspond to or correlate with the actual amount of P removed in
   the percolation columns. Hence, the Langmuir-isotherm does not estimate
   the P-removal capacities of sands. It is suggested that a suitable quick
   method of screening a selection of potential media for P-removal
   potential is to perform simple removal isotherm studies using water with
   a similar chemical composition as the wastewater to be treated. This
   method will not provide a direct estimate of the P-removal capacity that
   can be obtained in full-scale systems, but it is a means of comparing
   the relative performance of potential media. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Title = {{Nitrification of high strength ammonia wastewaters: Comparative study of
   immobilisation media}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1169-1178}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Due to legislative pressures, sludge production and processing in the UK
   will increase substantially in the future resulting in a supernatant
   liquid high in ammonia (500-1000 mg l(-1)) and ``hard{''} COD (similar
   to 500 mg l(-1)). A small footprint reactor is required to effectively
   nitrify this effluent, and the aim of this work was to compare a number
   of immobilisation media under a variety of conditions in order to
   determine which media held the most promise for future development.
   Laboratory-scale continuously stirred tank reactors containing freely
   suspended and immobilised biomass were operated with a high-strength
   synthetic ammonia wastewater (500 mg Nl(-1)) to determine the
   nitrification rates at various temperatures, and ammonia and COD
   loadings. COD:NH, ratios in sludge liquors vary widely depending on the
   treatment processes employed, and therefore ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 were
   tested as being fairly typical. The freely suspended nitrifiers were
   washed out of the reactors at a 1 d hydraulic retention time (HRT),
   whereas the reactors containing adsorption particles (Linpor and
   Kaldnes) and PVA-encapsulated nitrifiers continued partially nitrifying
   down to 12 h, and oxygen addition enhanced nitrification. A decrease in
   temperature from 25 to 16 degreesC only caused a small (10\%) decrease
   in nitrification in the immobilised cell reactors, demonstrating that
   nitrification was mass transfer rather than kinetically controlled. A
   reduction in nitrification occurred when glucose (500 mg l(-1)) was
   added to the feed due to the growth of a heterotrophic population. The
   adsorbed biomass reactors lost 35\% of nitrification compared to only
   7\% with PVA, and it appears that the colonisation of PVA by
   heterotrophs is more difficult than for Linpor and Kaldnes. Respiration
   rates for all particles increased with lime in the reactors, and
   nitrifiers immobilised in PVA retained approximately 40\% of their
   viability after immobilisation. Volumetric nitrification rates were
   generally higher for the PVA reactor than for Linpor and Kaldnes, and
   were: suspended biomass reactor: 0.36; Linpor: 0.57; Kaldnes: 0.53 and
   PVA: 0.70 kg N m(-3)-reactor d(-1) for a 25\% reactor fill. These equate
   to 2.28, 4.24 and 3.97 g Nm(-2)-media d(-1) for Linpor, Kaldnes and PVA
   respectively; hence other reactor till rates for Kaldnes warrant further
   investigation. However, the PVA particles with the highest nitrification
   rates under all conditions showed promise as an immobilisation medium,
   and are amenable to further optimisation for the nitrification of
   high-strength ammonia wastewaters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The Rantox biosensor was designed for anaerobic wastewater treatment
   process control, and detects modifications of the feed based on the
   response of the acetoclastic methanogens contained in the sensor to
   periodic pulses of a concentrated organic substrate. The biosensor was
   tested under various operating conditions at the laboratory scale, in
   parallel with a digester under control fed on the same substrate. The
   aim was to evaluate the response of the biosensor in the presence of an
   incoming organic toxic compound (CHCl3). The experimental set-up, i.e.
   the biosensor and the digester, was connected to an automated control
   system developed under LabVIEW(R) environment for data acquisition and
   operational sequence programming (the Rantox Virtual Instrument).
   Biomasses with different activities were used as inocula, and inhibition
   was induced by dosing chloroform according to two different procedures.
   The results showed good sensitivity and rapid response of the biosensor
   to feed intoxication. The presence of chloroform was detected by the
   Rantox with a rapid and visible response, and well in advance with
   respect to the digester. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A model for wastewater degradation in a tapered waste stabilization pond
   was derived as a modified Bessel function by materials balance approach.
   Based on hypothetical data, the tapered model gave lower faecal bacteria
   removal than the conventional (rectangular) model for various values of
   dispersion number, die-off rate coefficient, average width and shape
   factors. The above results were corroborated by data collected from two
   laboratory ponds operated in parallel; one having a tapered and the
   other a rectangular surface area. The latter gave slightly higher
   hydraulic efficiency and BOD5 removal. Besides, faecal bacteria removal
   was significantly lower in the tapered pond than in the rectangular pond
   at 0.10 level of significance. Calculated faecal bacteria reduction
   using the tapered model was in good agreement with measured data with
   coefficient of correlation and standard error of 0.904 and 0.014,
   respectively. Effects of tapering on ponds with respect to construction
   cost, operational and maintenance ease and accuracy of estimated design
   parameters are also discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The stability characteristics of a continuous bioreactor with cell
   recycle for biodegradation of mixed wastes are investigated. The system
   involves a pure culture of Pseudomonas putida and media containing
   phenol and glucose as carbon and energy sources. The model growth
   kinetics for the two substitutable substrates were experimentally
   validated in a previous study. The stability analysis carried out using
   elementary principles of bifurcation theory shows rich dynamics
   characteristics of the reactor model, including steady-state
   multiplicity and hysteresis. The effect of the bioreactor operating
   parameters on the stability behavior of the model is discussed.
   Practical criteria are also derived for the safe operation of the unit
   and to prevent the occurrence of wash-out conditions. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1209-1218}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A cyanobacterium isolated from a source-water reservoir during a spring
   odor and taste episode and identified as Anabaena sp. consistently
   produced geosmin during laboratory culture on modified BG-11 liquid
   medium. Maximal geosmin/biomass occurred at 20 degreesC and a light
   intensity of 17 muE/m(2)/s; geosmin/chl a values directly correlated
   with increasing light intensity (r(2) = 0.95, P<0.01). It was concluded
   that at 20<degrees>C, increasing light intensity favors less chl a
   synthesis and higher geosmin synthesis; at 17 muE/m(2)/s, increasing
   temperature stimulates chl a production (to 25 degreesC) while
   repressing geosmin synthesis (above 20 degreesC). Nutritional factors
   promoting biomass, chl a, and geosmin synthesis by Anabaena sp. were
   also investigated. For cultures grown at 17 muE/m(2)/s and 20 degreesC
   for 20 days, both ammonium-N and nitrate-N generally enhanced the growth
   of Anabaena sp. Nitrate-N promoted more chl a production (r(2) = 0.99)
   than ammonium-N. Geosmin synthesis was directly correlated with
   ammonium-N concentrations (r(2) = 0.89), with low nitrate-N (123.5
   mug/l) favoring maximal geosmin production (2.8 mug/l). Increasing
   nitrate-N concentrations promoted a three-fold increase in chin content
   with geosmin synthesis decreased by two-fold. Geosmin/mg biomass was
   directly related to ammonium-N concentration; high nitrate-N levels
   suppressed geosmin production. No geosmin was detected at or below 118
   mug phosphate phosphorus/l. Geosmin, dry weight biomass, and chl a
   production were correlated with increasing phosphorus (P) concentration
   (r(2) = 0.76, 0.96 and 0.98, respectively). No geosmin was detected when
   copper was present in growth media at or above 6.92 mug Cu2+ /1 (CuSO4.
   5H(2)O). Dry weight biomass and chl a production were negatively
   correlated with Cu2+ ion concentrations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The ability of fungi to degrade aniline and its derivatives in water is
   reported. Several fungi are able to degrade aniline and its derivaties
   as a sole nitrogen, carbon and energy source. Some of these fungi were
   obtained from activated sludge by enrichment technique. Among the 10
   studied fungi, Fusarium sp. and Rhizopus sp. utilize aniline as a sole
   nitrogen, carbon and energy source, with production of acetanilide and
   catechol. Fusarium sp. utilized 70\% of 10 mmol aniline and produced
   3.55 mM ammonia during 30 days. Rhizopus sp. utilized 65\% of 10 mmol
   aniline during 30 days. Rhizopus sp. and Fusarium sp. utilized only
   2-chloroaniline and 3-chloroaniline as nitrogen source in the presence
   of glucose, with production of catechol, ammonium and chloride. The
   utilization of 2-chloroaniline was better than 3-chloroaniline, by
   Fusarium sp. and Rhizopus sp. Cladosporium sp. was the best isolate
   which could use aniline blue as the only source of nitrogen. This fungus
   reduced 89\% of aniline blue, and ammonia is produced as the result of
   aniline blue biodegradation by Cladosporium sp. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Sewage effluent discharged to surface water has been shown to contain
   human hormones, particularly oestrogens, and synthetic chemicals which
   may be able to disrupt the endocrine system. Since many surface waters
   which receive sewage effluent are subsequently used as drinking water
   sources, it is important to demonstrate that treated drinking water is
   not contaminated. Oestrogenic activity in rivers and drinking water in
   the region of Severn Trent Water was studied using a combination of
   bioassay, to integrate exposure over lime, and advanced chemical
   analysis. There was little or no evidence of substances that were
   oestrogenic, even in waters receiving significant amounts of sewage
   effluent. Oestrogenic activity, as measured in the rainbow trout
   vitellogenin assay, was seen at the Tame/Trent confluence but this
   activity was relatively weak. There was no activity detected at raw
   water intakes and no hormones or substances that are oestrogenic were
   detected in the final drinking water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Title = {{Photocatalytic degradation of the cyanotoxin cylindrospermopsin, using

Abstract = {{Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii produces the cyanotoxin
   cylindrospermopsin, which is commonly found in SouthEast Queensland
   water reservoirs, and has been responsible for the closure of these
   reservoirs as a source of drinking water in recent times. Thus,
   alternative more effective treatment methods need to be investigated for
   the removal of toxins such as cylindrospermopsin. This study examined
   the effectiveness of two brands of titanium dioxide under UV photolysis
   for the degradation of cylindrospermopsin. Results indicate that
   titanium dioxide is an efficient photocatalyst for cylindrospermopsin
   degradation. The titanium dioxide (TiO2), brand Degussa P-25 was found
   to be more efficient than the alternate brand Hombikat UV-100. There was
   an influence from solution pH (4, 7, and 9) with both brands of titanium
   dioxide, with high pH resulting in the best degradation rate.
   Importantly, there was no adsorption of cylindrospermopsin to titanium
   dioxide particles as seen with other cyanotoxins, which would adversely
   influence the degradation rate. Degradation rates were not influenced by
   temperature (19-34 degreesC) when P-25 was the source of TiO2, some
   temperature influence was observed with UV-100. Dissolved organic carbon
   concentration will reduce the efficiency of titanium dioxide for
   cylindrospermopsin degradation, however the presence of other inorganic
   matter in natural waters greatly assists the photocatalytic process.
   With minimal potentially toxic by-product formation expected with this
   treatment, and the effective degradation of cylindrospermopsin, titanium
   dioxide UV photolysis is a promising speculative alternative water
   treatment method. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the separation of titanium dioxide from water by
   cross-flow microfiltration (CMF) within wastewater treatment by
   photocatalysis using slurry reactor systems. The systematic studies have
   shown that the separation performance of TiO2 particles is strongly
   affected by cross-flow velocity, transmembrane pressure, feed
   concentration, pH of the suspension and ionic strength. An extreme
   sensitivity to pH and electrolyte concentration indicates the importance
   of interfacial effects in solid-liquid separation of TiO2 particles.
   Under optimal conditions, permeate fluxes of up to 12501 m(-2) h(-1),
   approaching those of pure water, could be obtained with a polypropylene
   membrane which is not sensitive to abrasion. The obtained results makes
   TiO2 separation by cross-flow microfiltration attractive in
   solar-catalytic detoxification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional water quality model to assess the long-term fate of
   2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) in three compartments (water,
   sediment, fish) of a river has been developed using the literature data
   on various model parameters. The transient deterministic model with
   constant or nonrandom parameters is solved numerically by the method of
   orthogonal collocation, while an analytical solution is developed for
   the steady-state model. The impact of uncertainty in several model
   parameters has been studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations assuming
   that the uncertain parameters are uncorrelated and can be modeled by
   three probability distributions (uniform, normal and lognormal). For the
   case of a high TCDD discharge into a small, shallow river, we find that
   the maximum TCDD contents of water and fish are well below the
   prescribed safe limits. We also find that the effects of uncertainty on
   water quality metrics are quite complex or nonintuitive and can be
   substantial. This is especially true for TCDD in fish, which can be
   higher by as much as 50-70\% than the deterministic predictions, if the
   parameter uncertainties follow uniform distributions. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A short review of different respirometric methods is presented, and
   advantages and disadvantages of different principles are discus sed. In
   this study a combined respirometric-titrimetric set-up was applied to
   monitor the degradation processes during batch experiments with
   activated sludge. The respirometer consists of an open aerated vessel
   and a closed non-aerated respiration chamber. It is operated with two
   oxygen probes resulting in two sources of information on the oxygen
   uptake rate; both collected at a high frequency. The respirometer is
   combined with a titrimetric unit that keeps the pH of the activated
   sludge sample at a constant value through the addition of acid and/or
   base. The cumulative amount of added acid and base serves as a
   complementary information source on the degradation processes.
   Interpretation of respirometric data resulting from validation
   experiments (additions of acetate and urea as ammonium source) showed
   that the set-up provided reliable data. Data interpretation was
   approached in two ways: (1) via a basic calculation procedure, in which
   the oxygen uptake rates were obtained by an oxygen mass balance over the
   respiration chamber, and (2) via a model-based procedure in which
   substrate transport was included for a more accurate data
   interpretation. Simulation examples showed that the presence of
   substrate transport in the model may be crucial for a correct data
   interpretation, since experimental conditions (e.g, low flow rate)
   and/or the biodegradation kinetic parameters (e.g. high Ks) may
   otherwise lead to data interpretation errors. Earlier studies already
   pointed out that titrimetric data can be related to nitrification, and
   this was also confirmed in this study. However, in addition, it was
   shown here for experiments with acetate that the amount of acid dosed
   was clearly related to the amount of acetate degraded. This indicates
   that the titrimetric data can be used to study the carbon source
   degradation. For the titrimetric data in this study, a model-based
   analysis was however only applied for the nitrification process. For an
   experiment with ammonium, it was illustrated that the estimation of
   biodegradation kinetics on a combined respirometric-titrimetric data set
   significantly improves confidence intervals of the parameters compared
   to the parameter estimation based on respirometric or titrimetric data
   separately. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A new, mechanistic approach for design and analysis of subsurface flow
   (SSF) constructed wetlands is presented. The model is based on the
   assumption that the biological processes in wetlands, like other
   biological systems, exhibit Monod kinetics. A Monod approach fits well
   with observed wetland performance. It predicts first-order behaviour at
   low concentrations, that is, pollutant removal rates which increase with
   increasing pollutant concentration; and zero-order or saturated
   behaviour at high pollutant concentrations, that is, a maximum pollutant
   removal rate. A kinetic analysis of subsurface flow constructed wetlands
   exhibiting Monod kinetics reveals that loading rate, as well as the
   zero-order degradation rate constant, are essential parameters for
   efficient wetlands design for the removal of organic carbon. In
   particular, Monod kinetics enables the identification of an absolute
   maximum removal rate which is necessary to prevent undersizing in
   design. This is significant because it represents a theoretical upper
   bound on loading rate for wetlands design. The analysis is applied to
   wetlands data collected in North America by the US EPA in order to
   extract design criteria for BOD removal. It reveals that maximum
   loadings for SSF wetlands are at least 80 kg ha(-1) d(-1) for BOD. In
   addition, a new dimensionless performance efficiency parameter, Omega,
   is presented as a more effective means of comparing wetland performance.

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1304-1310}},

Abstract = {{Chlorine is the most widely used disinfectant of wastewater due to its
   capacity to inactivate most pathogenic microorganisms quickly. However,
   chlorine reacts with natural organic compounds present in wastewater to
   produce some undesirable organic byproducts. One such class of compounds
   is the nitrogenous compounds. The reaction between chlorine and
   compounds containing a nitrogen atom with one or more hydrogen atoms
   attached to it will form chloramines which have lower disinfection
   efficiency. Eighty percent of the wastewater generated in Jordan is
   treated at the Khirbet As-Samra wastewater treatment plant for eventual
   use in agriculture. In this study efficiency of chlorination was studied
   by collecting samples from the effluent of the treatment plant. The
   yield concentration of N-chloramines upon chlorination was determined.
   Efficiency of disinfection process as a function of contact time,
   concentration of chlorine dosage, concentration of nitrogenous compound
   and pH were studied. In this study, it has been found that at a chlorine
   dosage of 15 mg/L and contact time of 15 min, the percentage total
   coliform kill in As-samra wastewater sample was 100\%. After addition of
   histidine, glycine and phenylalanine (15 mg/L in each case) to the
   wastewater sample, the percentage of total coliform kill dropped to 58,
   78 and 79\% respectively. When chlorine dosage was increased to 24 mg/L
   the percentage total coliform kill reached 96, 99 and 100\% in
   wastewater samples treated with 5 mg/L histidine, glycine and
   phenylalanine, respectively. The percentage total coliform kill dropped
   to zero in wastewater samples treated with histidine, glycine and
   phenylalanine at a concentration of 30 mg/L each. This work supports the
   theory that amino acids and ammonia preferentially react with chlorine
   to form N-chloramine which significantly reduces the disinfection
   efficiency of the chlorination process. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{At the high-rate anaerobic treatment of domestic sewage, both biological
   and physical processes play an important role. Therefore, the anaerobic
   biodegradability of raw, paper-filtered and membrane-filtered sewage and
   black water has been investigated in batch experiments. Additionally,
   the effect of anaerobic digestion on physical characteristics, like
   particle size, surface tension and zetapotential, of the present
   particles is studied. The biodegradability of domestic sewage and black
   water at 30 degreesC is almost similar (71-74\%). Moreover, a high
   methanogenesis of the colloidal fraction in domestic sewage (86 +/- 3\%)
   is achieved, showing that the low removal of colloidal particles in
   continuous high-rate anaerobic reactors is due to low physical removal
   rather than biodegradability. The lowest biodegradability is
   demonstrated for the disserved fraction (62\%). The results show that
   after anaerobic digestion the average radius of particles with diameter
   <4.4 and <0.45 mum increased for domestic sewage, while it decreased for
   black water. Part of the surface-active components in domestic sewage is
   not biodegraded during anaerobic batch digestion, as indicated by the
   development of the surface tension. The negative seta-potential of all
   particles hardly changes during digestion, showing that colloidal
   interactions were not affected by anaerobic digestion. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Microorganisms are fundamental components of energy fluxes in aquatic
   ecosystems. Interest in plankton production and respiration has recently
   stimulated exploration of the use of electron transfer system (ETS)
   activity in oceanography and limnology. If we consider microorganism
   production (MP) and microorganism respiration (MR), due to aerobic and
   anaerobic metabolism, microorganism growth efficiency can be defined as
   MGE=MP/(MP+MR). In order to calculate MGE, we measured independently the
   two components of ETS (photosynthesis electron transfer system activity
   (PETS) and respiration electron transfer system activity (RETS)) during
   an annual cycle using a portable biosensor microorganisms amperometric
   detector system (MiDAS) on the site. MGE was calculated in samples
   collected from the photic and aphotic zones and the superficial sediment
   and ranged between 0.60 and 0.45 and dropped to 0.15 at the end of the
   summer. This substantial decrease is probably due to the prevalence of

Abstract = {{Blooms of blue-green algae in reservoirs often produce the musty-earthy
   taste and odour algal metabolites 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) and geosmin.
   MIB and geosmin are not removed by conventional water treatment and
   their presence in the distribution system, even at low ng L-1 levels,
   can result in consumer complaints. Powdered activated carbon (PAC) can
   effectively remove MIB and geosmin when the correct dose is applied. The
   homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM) was used to predict PAC doses
   required to reduce MIB and geosmin concentrations to below 10 ng L-1 at
   four water treatment plants in Adelaide, South Australia. In jar tests,
   undertaken under treatment plant conditions, the predicted doses were
   found to produce water of the desired quality in three of the four
   waters. The poor predictions found in the fourth water, which had a
   considerably higher turbidity, were attributed to the incorporation of
   PAC in a larger, denser floc, leading to a reduced effective contact
   time of the adsorbent. It was found that higher doses of PAC were
   required for both compounds to produce acceptable quality water when
   turbidities rose above 26NTU. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Lake water, pore water, and sediments were sampled in both polluted and
   unpolluted lakes from Southwestern (SW) China Plateau. The results show
   that although the mechanisms of nutrient regeneration were similar in
   the polluted and unpolluted lakes, the processes, however, were much
   stronger in the polluted lakes. Nitrogen regeneration was mainly of
   organic process. Phosphorus regeneration was essentially controlled by
   iron redox cycling near sediment/water interface. Nutrient upward fluxes
   were in the order SiO2 > NH4+ > PO43-. This study has significance for
   further investigating the response of nutrient biogeochemistry to the
   increasing nutrient levels in aquatic environments. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The chemical decomposition of p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a priority
   phenolic pollutant present in wastewaters from some agro-industrial
   plants, is studied by means of a single photochemical process produced
   by a polychromatic UV radiation and by hydroxyl radicals generated by
   the combination of UV radiation plus hydrogen peroxide and by the
   Fenton's reagent (hydrogen peroxide plus ferrous salts). Batch
   experiments were conducted to establish the degradation levels obtained
   and the quantum yields in the single photodecomposition process. An
   improvement in the decomposition of the phenolic acid in the combined
   UV/H2O2 oxidation is observed, due to the generation of OH radicals, and
   the contribution of the radical reaction to the global process is
   determined. In the Fenton's reagent oxidation, the effects of the
   operating variables (H2O2 and Fe2+ initial concentrations, pH, type of
   buffer used) are established and the rate constant for the reaction of
   p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid with OH radicals is evaluated from a kinetic
   model, its value being 7.02 x 10(8) M-1 s(-1) at 20 degreesC. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{A new design of equilibrator for carbon dioxide monitoring in natural
   waters is described. It consists in a vertical tube filled with marbles
   through which water is flowing while equilibrating with a closed air

   equilibrators, among which is a fast response time (half-life constant
   approximate to 30 s) and the potential to work in very turbid water. The
   proposed equilibrator is of particular interest to monitor carbon
   dioxide in coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, which are known to be
   turbid and highly dynamic. Two performance tests and some field results

Abstract = {{This paper examines the potential for phytoremediation of MTBE, a
   gasoline additive that has become a prevalent and persistent groundwater
   pollutant, due to its' non-sorbing and non-reactive nature in water. A
   novel experimental design is developed to measure plant uptake and
   transpiration of MTBE from hydroponic systems, separating these
   processes from passive volatilization of the chemical. Plant uptake
   experiments indicate 30\% reduction in MTBE mass in water over a 1-week
   period by small poplar saplings, at both high (1600 ppb) and low (300
   ppb) MTBE concentrations. Active plant uptake of MTBE was approximately
   double that achieved by passive volatilization through a balsa wood
   control. MTBE was detected in biomass at the 100-ppb level, confirming
   passage of MTBE through the plant. A mass balance indicated that MTBE
   was largely untransformed during transport through the small poplar
   saplings to air. The high degree of MTBE removal achieved by small
   plants over a short period of time indicates great potential for
   successful phytoremediation of subsurface MTBE plumes using poplar
   trees. The fraction of MTBE removed from the hydroponic systems
   correlated well with volume of water transpired by the plants; the
   correlation enabled computation of the MTBE transpiration stream
   concentration factor of approximately 1, an important parameter for the
   design of engineered MTBE phytoremediation systems. (C) 2001 Published

Abstract = {{Cyanobacteria are common in eutrophic natural waters. Being favoured by
   warm, stable and nutrient-enriched waters they may constitute an
   important part of the phytoplankton community in Wastewater Treatment
   Plants (WWTP). The phytoplankton communities of two ponds (facultative
   and maturation) of the WWTP of Esmoriz (North Portugal) were studied,
   with particular importance given to cyanobacteria. Mouse bioassays were
   performed with cyanobacteria samples during some of the blooms and ELISA
   assays specific for hepatotoxic microcystins were carried out. During
   the study period (January-July 1999) cyanobacteria were frequently
   dominant in the ponds ranging from 15.2 to 99.8\% of the total
   phytoplankton density. The main species were Planktothrix mougeotii,
   Microcystis aeruginosa and Pseudanabaena mucicola. Mouse bioassays were
   performed during Oscillatoria bloom period but the results were
   negative, in spite of the high cyanobacteria biomass. ELISA assays were
   performed for both ponds but only in the maturation pond positive values
   were found. Microcystin concentrations las MCYST-LR equivalents) varied
   from 2.3 to 56.0 mug/l on the margin of the pond and between 1.7 and 4.6
   mug/l in the outflow of this pond. These values indicate that WWTP may
   be a source of contamination of water bodies with cyanobacteria toxins.

   time, experimentally evaluated the cake characteristics of viable
   waste-activated sludge subject to polyelectrolyte flocculation and to
   freeze/thaw treatment under a pressure range of 25-200 kPa. There exists
   a threshold pressure exceeding which the cake structure would
   significantly deteriorate. Also, the present biological sludge is a
   ``super-compactible'' sludge, whose compactibility is greater than most
   data ever reported in open literature. The information presented herein
   has implications to filter design/operation and can be used as a
   reference data set for examining the existing filtration theories. (C)

Abstract = {{High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were developed for
   the optimised determination of five herbicide residues (dichlorprop,
   isoproturon, mecoprop, metsulfuron-methyl and 2,4,5-T) and major
   metabolites. These compounds represent important groups of herbicides
   and several residues have been found as contaminants in groundwater. The
   methods make it possible to study these herbicides and several
   transformation products through simultaneous detection and
   quantification. Culture media as well as cleaned up extracts from
   sediment and groundwater can be analysed. Using HPLC with UV detection
   the general limit of quantification was 1.8 ng injected corresponding to
   a detection limit of 1-2 mug/l when analysing a cleaned up extract from
   a 20 mi water sample. The method was verified by analysing herbicide
   residues in groundwater collected from a wetland area. Cleaning up 20 mi
   groundwater with a residue level of 25 mug/l the general recovery was
   within 58-82\%. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Microprofiles of the methane concentration in a 3.5-mm-thick sewage
   outlet biofilm were measured at high spatial and temporal resolution
   using a microscale biosensor for methane. In the freshly collected
   biofilm, methane was building up to a concentration of 175 mu mol l(-1)
   at 3 mm depth with a total methanogenesis of 0.14 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), as
   compared to an aerobic respiration (including methane oxidation) of 0.80
   mu mol m(-2) s(-1). A model biofilm was established by homogenisation of
   an in situ biofilm and 12 days of incubation with surplus sodium
   acetate. The homogenised biofilm was able to maintain 50\% of the
   methanogenic activity in the absence of external electron donor. Oxygen
   had only a minor effect on the methane production, but aerobic
   respiration consumed a substantial part of the produced methane and was
   thus an important control on methane export from the biofilm. A
   concentration of 2 mmol l(-1) nitrate was shown to inhibit
   methanogenesis only in the upper layer of the biofilm, whereas a further
   addition of 2 mmol l(-1) sulphate inhibited methanogenesis in the entire
   biofilm. The study demonstrated the power of the methane microsensor in
   the study of microhabitats with concurrent production and consumption of
   methane. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of ultraviolet radiation from low- and medium-pressure
   mercury are lamps on Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts was studied using a
   collimated beam apparatus. Experiments were conducted using parasites
   suspended in both filtered surface water and phosphate buffered
   laboratory water. Inactivation of oocysts was measured as reduction in
   infectivity using a CD-1 neonatal mouse model and was found to be a
   non-linear function of UV dose over the range of germicidal doses tested
   (0.8-119 mJ/cm(2)). Oocyst inactivation increased rapidly with UV dose
   at doses less than 25 mJ/cm(2) with two and three log-units inactivation
   at approximately 10 and 25 mJ/cm(2), respectively. The cause of
   significant leveling-off and tailing in the UV inactivation curve at
   higher doses was not determined. Maximum measured oocyst inactivation
   ranged from 3.4 to greater than 4.9 log-units and was dependent on
   different batches of parasites. Water type and temperature, the
   concentration of oocysts in the suspension, and the UV irradiance did
   not have significant impacts on oocyst inactivation. When compared on
   the basis of germicidal UV dose, the oocysts were equally sensitive to
   low- and medium-pressure UV radiation. With respect to Cryptosporidium,
   both low- and medium-pressure ultraviolet radiation are attractive
   alternatives to conventional chemical disinfection methods in drinking
   water treatment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved}},

Abstract = {{Alton Water, Suffolk, UK is a pumped storage reservoir that has a
   history of cyanobacterial blooms. Dosing of the input water with ferric
   sulphate to control external phosphorus loading has occurred since 1983.
   A detailed study of the sediment chemistry of the site was carried out
   between May 1995 and July 1997. Sequential phosphorus fraction analysis
   indicated a decrease along the length of the reservoir in sediment
   labile phosphorus content from 0.62 to 0.08 mg P g(-1) dw and iron-bound
   phosphorus content from 3.22 to 0.46 mg P g(-1) dw. These gradients
   positively correlated with water column chlorophyll rr concentrations
   reported in a parallel study. Labile and iron-bound sediment phosphorus
   contents were in a dynamic equilibrium due to diffusional release,
   contributing to internal loading to the water column. Equilibrium
   phosphorus concentrations (EPC) determined from phosphorus adsorption
   capacity (PAC) experiments were lower inside the bunded region
   (0.01-0.03 mg P-PO4 l(-1)) where iron content was greatest compared to
   outside the bund (0.15-0.20 mg P-PO4 l(-1)) suggesting greater potential
   for diffusional release of phosphorus at the latter site. PAC
   experiments indicated that anaerobic and pH-mediated loadings were of
   less importance than diffusional release, although the latter map have
   contributed to internal loading in the main reservoir. Sulphate
   concentrations may act to increase the potential for anaerobic internal
   loading near to the pumped input in microstratified sediment. Sediment
   iron content decreased from 250 +/- 13.1 to 51 +/- 4.0 mg Fe g(-1) dw
   across the line of a constructed bund at the north-west end near to the
   pumped input, which indicated successful control of dispersal of the
   fine ferric floc. The management implications with regard to phosphorus
   loadings indicated by these results are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The literature reports conflicting observations regarding the need for
   nutrient addition to biofilters treating contaminated gases. Such
   conflicts are often based on quasi-steady-state performance data
   collected on biofilters operated under continuous loading conditions. In
   the studies described herein, the impact of nitrogen limitations on two
   toluene-fed biofilters was assessed over a 97-day period. The biofilters
   were packed with polyurethane foam medium and contained different
   initial levels of nitrate-nitrogen. Toluene and CO2 concentration
   profiles were monitored during both normal steady loading conditions and
   short-term, unsteady-slate transient loading conditions (e.g., shock
   loads). Packing medium samples were periodically removed and analyzed to
   quantify changes in nitrate-nitrogen content over time. Data are
   presented which show that over long-time periods (several months),
   nutrient-induced kinetic limitations diminished biofilter performance
   during transient, unsteady-state conditions even when performance during
   normal steady loading was not adversely affected. Elemental analysis of
   biomass removed from the biofilters support nitrate-nitrogen and CO2
   concentration profile data and clearly illustrate how kinetically
   limited biofilters fail during shock loads even when there is an overall
   stoichiometric excess of nutrients. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Sewage sludge can be applied to land to supply and recycle organic
   matter and nutrients. Trace elements in sludge, however, may accumulate
   in the soil with repeated sludge applications. Reducing metal content
   may therefore reduce the adverse effects of sludge application. The
   objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of bioleaching
   technology in reducing metal content and toxicity as measured by a
   battery of terrestrial and liquid-phase bioassays. Sludge-soil mixtures
   simulating the application of sludge to land were tested by means of
   terrestrial bioassays, barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seed germination (5
   d) and sprout growth (14 d), lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seed germination
   (5 d), and worm (Eisenia andrei) mortality (14 d). Liquid-phase
   bioassays, Microtox (R) (Vibrio fischeri, 15 min), lettuce root
   elongation (L. sativa, 5 d), cladoceran mortality (Daphnia magna, 48 h),
   and SOS Chromotest (Escherichia coli) were used after elutriation of the
   sludge. Comparison of the bioassay results (except for D. magna) before
   and after treatment demonstrated that this bioleaching process reduced
   both sludge toxicity and metal content. In addition, lower Cu and Zn
   concentrations found in barley sprouts following treatment supported the
   assumption that the bioleaching process, by decreasing metal content and
   bioavailability, reduced sewage sludge toxicity. This study also
   emphasized the interest of using ecotoxicological bioassays for testing
   biosolids. In particular, the terrestrial bioassays after simulation of
   land application and the Microtox (R) test after sludge elutriation
   proved to be the most appropriate procedures. (C) 2001 Published by

Abstract = {{The effect of copper(II) and nickel(II) ions on the growth and
   bioaccumulation properties of non-adapted and adapted growing cells of a
   non-pathogenic Candida sp. has been tested under laboratory conditions
   as a function of initial pH and initial metal ion concentration. Optimum
   pH value for maximum metal ion accumulation was determined as 4.0 for
   both the metal ions. Although the copper(II) adapted Candida sp. was
   capable of removing of copper(II) with the maximum specific uptake
   capacity of 36.9 mg g(-1) at 783.6 mg dm(-3) initial copper(II)
   concentration, non-adapted Candida was only capable of bioaccumulating
   copper(II) with 23.1 mg g(-1) maximum uptake capacity from aqueous
   solution at 578.7 mg dm(-3) initial copper(II) concentration. The
   non-adapted and nickel(II) adapted Candida cells also showed the highest
   nickel(Ir) uptake capacities (46.8 and 30.8 mg g(-1), respectively) at
   321.5 and 300.6 mg dm(-3) initial nickel(II) concentrations,
   respectively. For both the non-adapted and nickel(II) adapted Candida
   sp., the growth of cells was totally inhibited by 500 mg dm(-3) of
   nickel(II) ions. The results also indicated that copper(II) adapted
   Candida sp. has been found to be more efficient to accumulate larger
   amounts of copper(II) than that of nickel(II) bioaccumulated by
   nickel(II) adapted Candida at higher initial metal ion concentrations
   without loosing its biological activity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Metal removal by biological solubilization in three strongly
   contaminated sediments was carried out in a two-liter stirred
   bioreactor. Biological treatment yielded metal removal efficiencies in
   the range of 11-30\%, 43-57\%, 60-79\%, 61-90\%, 18-21\%, 0-10\% for
   Pb,Cu,Zn,Cd,Ni and Cr, respectively. The treated sediments were then
   rinsed with a NaCl solution (0.5 M), resulting in an increase by nearly
   47\% in Pb removal for the three sediments, while for other metals (Cu,
   Zn, Cd, Ni, Cr), the NaCl rinse did not seem to allow any significant
   increase in metal solubilization. A standard procedure of sequential
   selective extraction (SSE) was applied to the sediments before and after
   each treatment. With regard to Pb, Zn and Cd, the carbonate bound
   fractions (2/3 sediments) represented 18-42\% of metals prior to
   treatment, while the iron and manganese oxides bound fraction
   constituted 39-60\% of metals for the three sediments. Between 90 and
   100\% of Pb, Zn and Cd removed by the process came from the fractions
   bound to carbonates and from those bound to Fe and Mn oxides. The
   organic matter and sulfide bound fractions contained 65-72\% of total Cu
   present before treatment and the process removed, on average, 63\% Cu
   present in this fraction. In contrast, Ni and Cr were found mainly in
   the residual fractions (50-80\%). Finally, this biological treatment did
   not solubilize Cr appreciably, while removal of Ni mostly originated
   from the carbonate and Fe/Mn oxides fractions (70-80\%). (C) 2001

   (2,3-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-7-benzofuranyl C12H15NO3) in a parallel plate

   of 1800 W. Carbofuran decomposition was enhanced with increasing power
   densities (1.65 W mL(-1)-5.55 W mL(-1)), and with decreasing initial
   concentrations (25 muM vs. 130 muM). The nature of the dissolved gas in
   solution also influenced the observed decomposition rate. The
   hydrodynamic behavior of the NAP reactor was characterized by
   calculating the Reynolds numbers and by performing tracer studies with a
   conservative tracer, sodium chloride (NaCl). The calculated dispersion
   coefficients indicate an intermediate amount of dispersion during
   operation of the reactor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effects of surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and Triton
   X-a00 (TX), and alcohols (methanol, ethanol, and propanol) on the
   dehalogenation of TCE and PCE by zero-valent iron were examined. Surface
   concentrations of PCE and TCE on the iron were dependent on aqueous
   surfactant concentrations. At concentrations above the CMC, sorbed
   halocarbon concentrations declined and concentrations associated with
   solution phase micelles increased. The anionic surfactant SDS
   ({[}SDS]<CMC) did not affect reduction rates, until the CMC was exceeded
   after which reactivity decreased, possibly due to sequestering of the
   TCE and PCE in mobile micelles. The nonionic TX showed a mixed effect on
   reactivity, increasing the PCE reduction rate, but not affecting TCE
   removal. Production of TCE from PCE increased in the presence of TX.
   Similar experiments showed that methanol, ethanol, and propanol
   inhibited reduction of TCE and PCE by metallic iron. Zero-valent iron
   may be useful in recycling soil washing effluents contaminated with TCE
   and PCE. <(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Public health concerns associated with cyanobacteria, both chronic and
   acute, arise from their ability to produce toxins. Rural communities
   within Australia and those in developing countries require an
   inexpensive and low-cost method for removing toxins from drinking water.
   A candidate technology is bank filtration. Adsorption of cyanobacterial
   hepatotoxins was measured in batch studies to determine the
   applicability of bank filtration as an efficient removal strategy. Five
   soils with different physicochemical properties were collected from
   regions around South Australia. The soils were mixed with either
   nodularin or microcystin-LR in distilled water and buffered solutions
   (pH 4.8, 6.9 and 9.1). Additionally, nodularin was mixed in unbuffered
   solutions (pH 4.8 and 8.9). The three soils with the high clay and/or
   organic carbon contents (Paringa A, McLaren Flat and Lakes Plains) had
   the higher nodularin adsorption coefficients, ranging from 0.2 to 16.59
   L kg(-1). Soil suspensions in acetate buffer (pH 4.8) generally produced
   significantly higher nodularin adsorption coefficients, when compared to
   the other buffer systems. The background interference from the ionic
   strength of the buffers, however, made interpretation of the effect of
   pH on toxin sorption difficult. Increases in solution ionic strength,
   from freshwater to seawater, resulted in corresponding increases in the
   nodularin adsorption coefficients for all sites, except the sandy
   Hallett Cove site. The implications for bank filtration are that higher
   water pH values and lower salinities will enhance the in situ mobility
   of the toxins, resulting in an increased distance of filtration through
   the river bank before toxin free water could be abstracted for human
   consumption. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Measurement of biomass activity in drinking water biofilters using a

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{1469-1477}},

Abstract = {{A simple respirometric method was developed and applied for the
   measurement of biomass activity in bench-scale drinking water
   biofilters. The results obtained with the new method, i.e. biomass
   respiration potential (BRP), indicated a high sensitivity allowing the
   quantification of the activity of low amounts of biomass. The analysis
   of duplicate samples showed a reasonable reproducibility, i.e. average
   coefficient of variation of 14\% (n = 19). The calculation of the ratio
   between biomass activity and the amount of viable biomass (phospholipid)
   at different filter depths indicated a substantial increase of this
   ratio with filter depth. This indicated an increased biomass activity
   per unit amount of viable biomass deeper in the biofilters, where
   biofilm thickness is low. The comparison of the filter profiles of
   biomass activity and dissolved biodegradable organic matter (BOM),
   expressed as theoretical oxygen demand, showed a high correlation
   between these profiles. Consequently, BRP results appear to be good
   indicators of the BOM removal capacity of the filter biomass. Therefore,
   BRP results can potentially be used in certain cases instead of BOM
   measurements for the assessment of the BOM removal capacity of drinking
   water biofilters, operated under different conditions. This is important
   because of the relative complexity of the measurements of BOM
   surrogates, e.g. assimilable organic carbon and biodegradable dissolved
   organic carbon, and BOM components. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The concentrations and distribution of 13 priority volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) were determined in sediments of the Scheldt estuary and
   the Belgian continental shelf, using a modified Tekmar LSC 2000
   purge-and-trap system coupled to GC-MS. The method allows a sample
   intake of up to 50 g wet weight and detection limits are between 0.003
   ng/g (tetrachloromethane) and 0.16 ng/g (m- and p-xylene). The
   repeatability (n = 5) varied between 4\% (benzene) and 17\% (toluene)
   and the recoveries ranged from 59\% (1,1-dichloroethane) to 99\%
   (tetrachloromethane). Because of the nature of the contaminants, special
   attention was paid to analyte losses and contamination of the samples
   during storage aboard the research vessel. Spiked sediment samples were
   prepared in the laboratory and stored aboard under the same conditions
   as the environmental samples. The recoveries for these samples varied
   between 94 and 130\%, which suggests that storage had no adverse effect
   on the samples. No detectable VOC concentrations were found for most of
   the sampling stations. However, in the Antwerp harbour area, significant
   concentrations of VOCs were found. The sorption behaviour as predicted
   from laboratory equilibrium partitioning experiments gives an indication
   of the in situ partitioning behaviour of VOCs. Although VOCs in
   sediments should, in general, not be regarded as a major problem in the
   marine environment, high local concentrations may be a cause of concern.

Abstract = {{We compared patterns of historical watershed nutrient inputs with
   in-river nutrient loads for the Neuse River, NC. Basin-wide sources of
   both nitrogen and phosphorus have increased substantially during the
   past century, marked by a sharp increase in the last 10 years resulting
   from an intensification of animal production. However, this recent
   increase is not reflected in changes in river loading over the last 20
   years. Temporal patterns in river loads more closely parallel short-term
   changes in point sources and cropland nutrient application despite their
   overall lower magnitude. Total phosphorus loads have declined at all
   stations considered, corresponding to a 1988 phosphate detergent ban.
   Nitrogen load temporal patterns Vary by location and the nitrogen
   fraction considered. The furthest upstream station exhibited nitrogen
   decreases after the completion of a dam in 1983. At a station just
   downstream of a rapidly growing urban area, the total nitrogen load has
   increased since the mid-1980s, primarily as a nitrate concentration
   increase. This is consistent with concurrent increases in chemical
   fertilizer use and point source discharges, as well as increased
   nitrification at treatment plants. This increase in nitrate loading is
   not reflected at the most downstream station, where no clear nitrogen
   trends are discernable. The lack of clear downstream nutrient increases
   suggests that current water quality impairment in the lower river and
   estuary may result from chronic nutrient overload rather than recent
   changes in the watershed. If this is true, then the impact of a planned
   30\% nitrogen loading reduction may not be immediately apparent. We
   calculate that, given annual variability, detecting a load reduction of
   this magnitude will take at least four years, and, should nutrients
   accumulated in the watershed become a significant source, detecting the
   resulting ecological improvements is likely to take substantially
   longer. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic colloids, including macromolecules and microparticles, with
   sizes ranging between 1 nm to 1 mum, play important roles in the
   mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals and other contaminants in
   natural waters. Cross-flow ultrafiltration has become one of the most
   commonly used techniques for isolating aquatic colloids. However, the
   ultrafiltration behavior of chemical species remains poorly understood.
   We report here the permeation behavior of major ions (Na, Ca, Mg, F, Cl,
   and SO4) in natural waters during ultrafiltration using an Amicon 1 kDa
   ultrafiltration membrane (S10N1). Water samples across a salinity
   gradient of 0-20 parts per thousand were collected from the Trinity
   River and Galveston Bay. The permeation behavior of major ions was well
   predicted by a permeation model, resulting in a constant permeation
   coefficient for each ion. The value of the model-derived permeation
   coefficient (P-c) was 0.99 for Na, 0.97 for Cl, and 0.95 for F,
   respectively, in Trinity River waters. Values of P-c close to 1 indicate
   that retention of Na, CI, and F by the 1 kDa membrane during
   ultrafiltration was indeed minimal (<1-5\%). In contrast, significant
   (14-36\%) retention was observed for SO4, Ca, and Mg in Trinity River
   waters, with a P-c value of 0.64, 0.82, and 0.86 for SO4, Ca and Mg,
   respectively. However, these retained major ions can further permeate
   through the 1 kDa membrane during diafiltration with ultrapure water.
   The selective retention of major ions during ultrafiltration may have
   important implications for the measurement of chemical and physical
   speciation of trace elements when using cross-How ultrafiltration
   membranes to separate colloidal species from natural waters. Our results
   also demonstrate that the percent retention of major ions during
   ultrafiltration decreases with increasing salinity or ionic strength.
   This retention is largely attributed to electrostatic repulsion by the
   negatively charged cartridge membrane. :<(c)> 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{This paper compares the membrane processes available for water
   treatment, Membranes have the advantage of currently decreasing capital
   cost, a relatively small footprint compared to conventional treatment,
   generally a reduction in chemicals usage and comparably low maintenance
   requirements. Three membrane processes applicable to water treatment,
   micro- (MF), ultra- (UF), and nanofiltration (NF), are compared in terms
   of intrinsic rejection, variation of rejection due to membrane fouling
   and increase in rejection by ferric chloride pretreatment. Twelve
   different membranes are compared on the basis of their membrane pore
   size which was calculated from their molecular weight cut-off. A pore
   size of <6 nm is required to achieve substantial (> 50\%) organics
   removal. For a fouled membrane this pore size is about 11 nm. UV
   rejection is higher than DOC rejection. Coagulation pretreatment allows
   a higher rejection of organics by MF and UF and the cut-off criterion
   due to initial membrane pore size is no longer valid. A water quality
   parameter (WQP) is introduced which describes the product water quality
   achieved as a function of colloid, DOC and cation rejection. The
   relationship between log (pore size) and WQP is linear. Estimation of
   membrane costs as a function of WQP suggests that open UF is superior to
   MF (similar cost at higher WQP) and NF is superior to tight UF. Chemical
   pretreatment could compensate for the difference between MF and UF.
   However, when considering chemicals and energy costs, it appears that a
   process operated at a higher energy is cheaper at a guaranteed product
   quality (less dependent on organic type). This argument is further
   supported by environmental issues of chemicals usage, as energy may be
   provided from renewable sources. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Aii

Abstract = {{One-hundred and twenty-five domestic roof-collected rainwater supplies
   in four rural Auckland districts were investigated in a cross-sectional
   survey to determine water duality. Samples of cold faucet water were
   analysed for physico-chemical and microbiological determinands,
   including metals (zinc, copper and lead), bacterial indicator
   organisms-heterotrophic plate count (HPC), total coilforms (TC), faecal
   coliforms (FC), enterococci (ENT), bacterial pathogens including
   Salmonella spp., Legionella spp., Campylobacter spp., Aeromonas spp. and
   the protozoa, Cryptosporidium and Giardia. Twenty-two supplies (17.6\%)
   exceeded one or more of the maximum acceptable values (MAV) or maximum
   guideline values for chemical determinands of the New Zealand Drinking
   Water Standards (NZDWS) and 70 (56.0\%) supplies exceeded the
   microbiological criteria of < 1 FC/100 mt. Eighteen supplies (14.4\%)
   exceeded the NZDWS MAV for lead of 0.01 mg/L and three (2.4\%) exceeded
   that for copper, of 2 mg/L. Those supplies with lead or galvanised iron
   comprising part of the roof or collecting system were more likely to
   show lead contamination (p = 0.019) as were those supplies with a pH
   less than 7 (p = 0.013). The presence of the indicator organisms HPC,
   TC, FC and ENT were all significantly correlated with one another.
   Aeromonas spp, were identified in 20 (16.0\%) supplies. There was a
   positive association between the presence of Aeromonas and the bacterial
   indicator organisms. Households reporting at least one member with
   gastrointestinal symptoms in the month prior to sampling, were more
   likely to have Aeromonas spp. identified in their water supply than
   those households without symptoms (odds ratio 3.22, 95\% CI 1.15-9.01,
   p=0.021). Salmonella typhimurium, was detected in one of 115 (0.9\%)
   supplies. Legionella spp. and Campylobacter spp. were not detected.
   There were 50 supplies sampled for protozoa (sampling criteria: <greater
   than or equal to>30 FC or greater than or equal to 60 ENT).
   Crytosporidium oocysts were detected in 2 (4\%) of these. Giardia was
   not detected. This study demonstrates that roof-collected rainwater
   systems provide potable supplies of relatively poor physicochemical and
   microbiological quality in the Auckland area. Further research is
   required on Aeromonas spp. as potential indicators of both
   microbiological duality and health risk along with design and
   maintenance strategies to minimise contamination of potable
   roof-collected rainwater supplies. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Contaminant transport in aquifers is usually represented by a solution
   to the advective-dispersive differential equation. When the contaminant
   is subject to non-linear degradation or decay, or it is characterized by
   a chemical constituent that follows a non-linear sorption isotherm, the
   resulting differential equation is non-linear. Using the method of
   decomposition, series solutions were obtained for the non-linear
   equation. The series were used to derive and test ``simulant{''}
   solutions that arise using the concept of double decomposition. Simulant
   solutions are closed-form analytic expressions that approximate part of
   the series. These expressions are simple, stable, and flexible. They
   permit an accurate forecasting of contaminant propagation under
   non-linearity in laboratory or field investigations at early or
   prolonged times after the spill. In this article, the practical scenario
   of an instantaneous spill, and that of a constant concentration boundary
   condition, is studied for situations of non-linear decay, non-linear
   Freundlich isotherm, and non-linear Langmuir isotherm. The solutions are
   verified with limited well-known analytical solutions of the linear
   reactive and non-reactive equations with excellent agreement, and with
   limited finite difference solutions.
   Plumes undergoing non-linear decay experience a profile re-scaling with
   respect to that of linear decay, the degree of which is controlled by
   the magnitude of the non-linear parameter b. The direction of the
   scaling (scaling up or scaling down with respect to the linear decay
   plume) is controlled by the magnitude of C (whether greater or less than
   1) in relation to the magnitude of b (whether greater or less-than 1).
   When C > 1, values of b >1 produce plumes that experience less decay
   (i.e., are scaled up) than that of the linear decay, whereas values of b
   < 1 produce non-linear plumes that experience more decay (i.e., are
   scaled down) than that of the linear decay. The opposite effect is
   observed when concentrations are less than 1. In other words, when C >1,
   values of b <1 produce non-linear plumes that experience more decay
   (i.e., are scaled down) than that of the linear decay, whereas values of
   b <1, produce non-linear plumes that experience less decay (i.e., are
   scaled up) than that of the linear decay.
   A plume undergoing non-linear sorption according to a Freundlich
   isotherm retards the processes of advection and dispersion with respect
   to a plume with no sorption. Similar to the case of non-linear decay,
   whether this retardation is more or less pronounced than that of the
   linear sorption plume depends on whether the values of b and C are
   greater or less than 1. The solution presented here for the advective
   dispersive equation subject to a Freundlich sorption isotherm is
   restricted to concentration greater than 1. When C > 1 and b <1, the
   decrease in mobility in the non-linear plume is not as pronounced as
   that of a plume modeled by a linear isotherm. Plume shape may be quite
   sensitive to the values of the non-linear parameters. Plumes with
   parameter values b < 1 (and C > 1) exhibit the well-known lack of
   symmetry with respect to their center of mass, sharp fronts, and the
   tailing effects observed at hazardous waste sites. As the magnitude of
   the non-linear parameter increases, the non-linear plume approaches the
   linear one. This partial non-linear ``retardation{''} can now be
   observed quantitatively with the models presented herein. The models
   developed also simulate the case of b >1 (i.e., ``unfavorable{''}
   sorption), which produce a plume even more retarded than the linear. The
   shape of a contaminant plume following a non-linear Langmuir isotherm is
   very sensitive to the magnitude of the non-linear parameter cr.
   Approximate solutions for mild non-linearity are presented. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{The effects of pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) on the reduction of Cr(VI)
   by dissolved Fe(II) were investigated for aqueous solutions having
   relatively low buffering capacities. All solutions were maintained at a
   constant ionic strength (generally 0.05 M) and temperature (23 +/- 2
   degreesC). For the majority of the experiments conducted, initial
   concentrations of Fe(II) and Cr(VI) were 50 and 20 muM, respectively,
   representing a deficient amount of Fe(II) (i.e. nonstoichiometric
   conditions). Experiments conducted in the absence and presence of DO
   were performed in an anaerobic chamber and in vessels open to the
   atmosphere, respectively. Specific initial pH values were obtained by
   adjusting the pH of Cr(VI) and Fe(II) stock solutions prior to their
   mixing or by spiking Cr(VI)-Fe(II) systems with strong base to rapidly
   increase the pH in situ. Consistent with previous reports, Cr(VI)
   reduction rates for our systems increased with increasing pH (pH ranges
   of 3.5-6 and 3.5-7.2 for oxic and anoxic experiments, respectively).
   Because of our poorly buffered experimental systems, pH values decreased
   over the course of the reactions which, in turn, caused decreases in the
   reduction rates with time. Spiking some experimental systems with NaOH
   to rapidly raise the pH resulted in faster rates of Cr(VI) reduction
   than when the pH was adjusted prior to mixing the stock solutions
   together; this observation is likely due to the presence of
   microenvironments in the reactors for which local, short-term pH values
   greatly exceed the equilibrium value (i.e, mixing is slower than the
   reduction reaction in these high pH microenvironments). The molar ratios
   of Fe(II) oxidized to Cr(VI) reduced were close to the expected
   stoichiometric value of 3 for the majority of our experimental systems,
   which shows that DO will not cause a serious interference in most
   applications using Fe(II) to reduce Cr(VI). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Limited information is available on the ability of subsurface flow
   wetlands to remove enteric pathogens. Two multi-species wetlands, one

   County Constructed Ecosystems Research Facility in Tucson, Arizona. Each
   wetland had a retention time of approximately 4 days. The objectives of
   this study were (1) to evaluate the ability of multi-species subsurface
   wetlands to physically remove Giardia cysts; Cryptosporidium oocysts,
   total and fecal coliforms, and coliphages; and (2) to determine the
   likely impact of local wildlife on the occurrence of these indicators
   and pathogens. In the wetland receiving secondary sewage effluent, total
   coliforms were reduced by an average of 98.8\% and fecal coliforms by
   98.2\%. Coliphage were reduced by an average of 95.2\%. Both Giardia
   cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts were reduced by an average of 87.8 and
   64.2\%, respectively. In the wetland receiving disinfected groundwater,
   an average of 1.3 x 10(2) total coliforms/100 mt and 22.3 fecal

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Data from 35 studies on 49 wetland systems used to treat stormwater
   runoff or runoff-impacted surface waters were examined and compared in
   order to identify any obvious trends that may aid future stormwater
   treatment wetland design efforts. Despite the intermittent nature of
   hydrologic and pollutant inputs from stormwater runoff, our analysis
   demonstrates that steady-state first-order plug-flow models commonly
   used to analyze wastewater treatment wetlands can be adapted for use
   with stormwater wetlands. Long-term pollutant removals are analyzed as
   functions of long-term mean hydraulic loading rate and nominal detention
   time. First-order removal rate constants for total phosphorus, ammonia,
   and nitrate generated in this fashion are demonstrated to be similar to
   values reported in the literature for wastewater treatment wetlands.
   Constituent removals are also demonstrated via regression analyses to be
   functions of the ratio of wetland area to watershed area. Resulting

Abstract = {{This paper compares the operation of a traditional single-stage system
   with a two-stage, reversible flow biodenitrification system for removing
   nitrates from drinking water. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the ability of these two-stage systems to remove nitrate and
   residual organics from treated water as compared to single-stage units.
   In the reversible flow system, the second-stage (i.e. follow) reactor is
   operated in series with the first-stage (i.e. lead) reactor. After a
   given period of operation, the flow regime is reversed so that the
   follow reactor becomes the lead one and vice versa. The active solids
   remaining in the follow reactor (previously the lead one) are capable of
   removing residual soluble organics and nitrates to levels below the
   concentrations provided by single-stage units particularly at HRTs as
   low as 0.5h. Nitrate-nitrogen removal efficiency improved slightly from
   98 to 99.5\% for the single- and two-stage systems, respectively. Most
   notably, reversible flow reactors were found to reduce long-term
   effluent residual organics concentrations with an average of
   approximately 1/3 that of the single-stage system. Also the reversible
   flow system, with its design redundancy, demonstrated the ability to
   receive extreme shock loads with no sustained loss of treatment
   efficiency. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and seasonal changes in trihalomethane (THM) concentrations were
   investigated in three distribution systems of Quebec (Canada) which are
   supplied by different surface waters and which use a variety of
   physicochemical treatment strategies. The investigation was based on an
   intensive 25-week sampling programme, undertaken at a time of year when
   the temperature of southern Quebec surface waters exceeds 4 degreesC
   (April-November). THMs and other water duality and operational
   parameters were monitored at points along the distribution
   system-between the treatment plant and the system extremities-which
   represented variable residence times of water. Results showed that THM
   concentrations vary significantly (from 1.5 to 2 times, depending on the
   utility) between finished waters as they leave the plant and water at
   the system extremities. When water temperature exceeds 15 degreesC,
   spatial THM variations are particularly high (from 2 to 4 times,
   depending on the utility). The development of multivariate regression
   models showed that water temperature was a better predictor of THM
   seasonal variability than chlorine dose, surrogates of natural organic
   matter and pH. Also; initial THM formation (in finished waters leaving
   the plant) was a good predictor of THM levels at distribution system
   extremities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Common phthalate pollutants, such as dimethyl phthalate and diethyl
   phthalate found in aqueous environmental matrices react with ammonium
   hydroxide at ordinary temperatures exhibiting an overall reaction order
   in the range 1.3-1.4. While the reaction is of first order with respect

   hydroxide. The rate constants for the reactions of these two phthalates
   in alkaline waters at ambient temperatures are in the range 1.3 x 10(-4)
   and 8.5 x 10(-5) L-x/mols. Under these conditions the estimated
   half-lives for dimethyl phthalate and diethyl phthalate at a
   concentration of each at 20 mg/L is 4.5 and 14h, respectively. Other
   phthalates are expected to exhibit similar kinetics in their base
   hydrolysis with NH4OH. Thus, the presence of both the phthalate esters
   and ammonia or ammonium salts in the water under alkaline conditions may
   result in their self-removal by hydrolysis. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

   method is needed for HAA monitoring. In the present study, a
   liquid-liquid microextraction, acidic methanol derivatization, and gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) detection method was developed
   for determining HAAs and dalapon in drinking water. The newly developed
   method is capable of analyzing all nine HAAs and dalapon at mug/l
   levels. The method performance, including the method detection limit
   (MDL) and spiking recovery, was evaluated. In comparison to EPA Method
   552.2, which uses gas chromatography/electron capture detection
   (GC/ECD), this GC/MS method gave cleaner baselines and had few
   interfering peaks. For each of all nine HAAs and dalapon, the MDL was
   less than 1 mug/l and the spiking recovery ranged from 73 to 165\%.
   Using the GC/MS method, the run time could also be significantly reduced
   without compromising the analytical results. Further study is needed to
   fine-tune this GC/MS based analytical method, especially in the
   detection of brominated trihaloacetic acids and monochloroacetic acid.

Abstract = {{This paper aims to study the ecological system of the Pardo River, at
   the source and lower-order passages, which are in the Botucatu area, Sao
   Paulo State, Brazil. This study was carried out to determine water
   quality with some chemical-physical indicators, coliforms, and chemical
   species of samples taken monthly, 1995/02-1996/01, from eight sampling
   stations sited along the Pardo River. The results in the river
   monitoring are discussed based on annual averages, analysis of variance,
   and compared to Tukey's Studentized Range-HSD, and principal component
   analysis (PCA) was applied to normalize data to assess association
   between variables. We can conclude that the variables used are very
   efficient for identifying and that the dry season shows the worst water
   quality. These were caused by organic matter, nutrients (originate) from
   anthropogenic sources (spatial sources) and mainly municipal wastewater,
   affecting the quality and hydrochemistry of the river water, which have
   been differentiated and assigned to polluting sources. Meanwhile, the
   degree of degradation of the Pardo River is low (sewage treatment
   carried out by the city of Pardinho is efficient), leaving the water of
   the river suitable for use by the population of Botucatu, after
   conventional treatment (Conama, Resolucao No. 20, CONAMA, Brazilia DF,
   09-23, 1986-the water of the Pardo river is classified as level 03). (C)

Abstract = {{Workers examining the transmission route(s) and reservoir(s) of
   infection for Helicobacter, pylori have postulated several environmental
   reservoirs for the organism, including water. Such work has, to date,
   concentrated on the bulk liquid in drinking water systems rather than on
   biofilms. Previous investigations by the authors have suggested biofilms
   in water distribution systems are a possible reservoir of infection.
   This current study comprised of an analysis of a section of cast iron
   mains distribution pipe removed from an urban environment in the
   north-east of Scotland during routine maintenance work. Immediately upon
   removal of the pipe section, the interior lumen was swabbed to remove
   the biofilm layer. Subsequent analysis for the presence of Helicobacter
   DNA using a nested PCR approach produced a positive result. This data
   provides the first evidence for the existence of Helicobacter in
   biofilms found in water distribution systems anywhere in the world. (C)

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{579-597}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Public concern over odours from sewage treatment works is increasing.
   More people are being exposed to odours, due to development around
   existing works or construction of new works. Increased awareness of both
   the environment and individual rights has meant people are now more
   likely to complain. Odour abatement and control is a major issue for
   sewage works operators. To control odours, they must first be measured.
   This is no easy task as response to odours is subjective. Our
   understanding of the sense of smell is incomplete, and there is no
   single measure that will directly relate to the likelihood of complaint.
   Odour measurement has often been regarded as an art as opposed to a
   science. Odour measurement techniques fail into two classes. Sensory
   measurements employ the human nose and measure the effects of the odour
   as perceived by an observer. Analytical measurements characterise odours
   in terms of their chemical composition and attempt to quantify the
   odorants present. Both methods are less than ideal - sensory
   measurements can be overly subjective and the interpretation of results
   requires care. Analytical measurements are complicated by the large
   number of odorants present, often at concentrations close to detection

Abstract = {{Ammonia can inhibit the formation of bromate in ozonated drinking water
   by reacting with free bromine (HOBr/OBr-), an intermediate in bromate
   formation, to form bromamines. Bromamines do not participate in bromate
   formation, however, they will decay due to autonomous decomposition and
   through reaction with ozone and hydroxyl radicals. The reaction with
   ozone controls the overall decay rate. This reaction also results in a
   net loss of ammonia from the system, leading to the possibility that all
   ammonia may be oxidized before the ozone residual in the water is
   eliminated, allowing bromate formation to resume. This paper presents a
   review of our understanding of bromamine chemistry and identifies areas
   that are not adequately understood, which may prevent an accurate
   estimation of ammonias impact on bromate formation. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The adsorption of cadmium ions onto bone char has been studied using a
   batch adsorber. The experimental data was analyzed using four sorption
   kinetic models-the pseudo-first order, the Ritchie second order, the
   modified second order and the Elovich equations-to determine the best
   fit equation for the sorption of metal ions onto bone char. The best-fit
   equation was identified using the sum of the errors squared (SSE).
   Finally, equilibrium studies were used to evaluate the sorption capacity
   of bone char for cadmium ions and experimental results showed this to be
   0.57 mmol g(-1) at an equilibrium solution concentration of 3.0 mmol
   dm(-3) Since the sorption capacity is relatively high, bone char can be
   considered as a suitable sorbent for the adsorption of cadmium in
   wastewater treatment systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The rates of adsorption of three commercial reactive dyes and Cu(II)
   from water in the absence and presence of complexing agents using
   chitosan were measured at 30 degreesC. Three simplified kinetic models,
   i.e,, pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle
   diffusion, were tested to investigate the adsorption mechanisms. It was
   shown that the adsorption of reactive dyes and Cu(II) in the absence of
   complexing agents could be best described by the intraparticle diffusion
   model, whereas that of Cu(II) in the absence of complexing agents such
   as EDTA, citric acid, and tartaric acid by the pseudo-second-order
   equation. Kinetic parameters of the three models and the normalized
   standard deviations between the measured and predicted results were also

Abstract = {{Testfilter experiments are reported For river Elbe water spiked with
   aromatic amines in order to determine biodegradation rates. For river
   Elbe water the mean degradation rate of DOC (C-0 = 6.64 mgl(-1)) was
   26.7 +/- 8.8\% after 6.8 days. No significant effect on the DOC
   degradation rate was observed with the addition of aromatic amines.
   Large differences in the biodegradation behaviour of the aromatic amines
   were observed: aniline was eliminated within 3 h, whereas the
   degradation of 2-nitroaniline was only 40\% after 14h effective contact
   lime. Degradation curves were mostly of a simple logarithmic type,
   demonstrating first-order kinetics. The degradation rate of
   2,4,6-trichloraniline increased by a factor of 20 within 6 weeks due to
   the adaptation of the testfilter biofilm. A linear relationship between
   available pK(a)-values and the logarithm of the experimental degradation
   rates was found. Thus, the results of the testfilter experiments may be
   extended to the estimation of the biodegradability of nontested aromatic
   amines. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   treatment system. Survival, sodium balance, drift, and feeding responses
   by P. proteus to treated and untreated AMD were examined. P. proteus
   nymphs exhibited significant losses of whole body sodium in exposures to
   untreated AMD. Nymphs exposed to treated effluents experienced no loss
   of whole-body sodium. Nymphs exposed to untreated AMD showed elevated
   drift rates and depressed feeding rates relative to those of nymphs
   exposed to treated AMD. and to AMD-free controls. No significant
   differences in feeding or drift behavior occurred between nymphs exposed
   to treated effluents and those exposed to AMD-free controls. The
   treatment system, with and without CO2 pretreatment, provided water that
   was not toxic to the test animals, and that allowed normal behavioral

Abstract = {{We investigated the use of flue-gas-desulfurization (FGD) by-products
   from electric power plant wet scrubbers as liners in wetlands
   constructed to improve mater quality, Mesocosm experiments were
   conducted over two consecutive growing seasons with different phosphorus
   loadings. Wetland mesocosms using FGD liners retained more total and
   soluble reactive phosphorus, with lower concentrations in the leachate
   (first year) and higher concentrations in the surface water (second
   year). Leachate was higher in conductivity (second year) and pH (both
   years) in lined mesocosms. Surface outflow did not reveal any
   significant difference in physicochemical characteristics between lined
   and unlined mesocosms. There was no significant difference in total
   biomass production of wetland plants between lined and unlined mesocosms
   although lon er average stem lengths and fewer stems bearing flowers
   were observed in mesocosms with FGD liners. Potentially phylotoxic boron
   was significantly higher in the belowground biomass of plants grown in
   lined mesocosms with low phosphorus lending. A larger-scale, long-term
   wetland experiment close to full scale is recommended from this
   two-year. mesocosm study to better predict the potentially positive and
   negative effects of using FGD by-products in constructed wetlands. (C)

Abstract = {{The hydrolysis of cyanogen chloride (ClCN) was studied as a function of
   temperature and pH. Results were used to resolve discrepancies among
   previously reported kinetic constants. The pH dependence was studied
   over a range of 9.54-10.93 at a temperature of 21.0 degreesC. The effect
   of temperature was investigated over the range of 10-30 degreesC at a pH
   of approximately 10. Changes in the concentrations of ClCN and the
   reaction products cyanic acid and chloride ion were monitored with time.
   For the conditions corresponding to these experiments, the
   hydroxide-assisted hydrolysis pathway predominated. Collision Frequency
   factor and activation energies recommended to represent the hydrolysis
   of ClCN in aqueous solution are A = 2.06 x 10(11) M-1 s(-1) and E-a =
   60. 980 J mol(-1) for the hydroxide-ion-assisted reaction, and A = 9.97

Abstract = {{The rate of oxidation of As(III) to As(V) by oxygen is increased by
   several orders of magnitude by the presence of dissolved Fe(III) and
   illumination with near ultraviolet light. The oxidation reaction has
   been studied in acidic conditions in the absence and presence of
   dissolved oxygen. A reaction mechanism has been postulated in which
   Fe(III)-hydroxide and -chloride complexes first absorb photons to
   produce highly oxidising hydroxyl and dichloro radicals. A series of
   rapid competing reactions involving free radicals then occur in which
   As(III) is oxidised via the As(IV) intermediate. The observed arsenic
   oxidation rate is controlled by the rate of photon absorption and the
   fraction of As(IV) which undergoes oxidising lather than reducing
   reactions. The use of iron compounds as a photo-oxidant is advantageous
   because Fe(III) hydroxide precipitate is an excellent adsorbent for
   As(V). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of influent COD/N ratio on N(2)O emission from a biological
   nitrogen removal process with intermittent aeration: supplied with
   high-strength wastewater, were investigated with laboratory-scale
   bioreactors. Furthermore, the mechanism of N(2)O production in the
   bioreactor supplied with low COD/N ratio wastewater was studied using
   (15)N tracer method, measuring of reduction rates in denitrification
   pathway, and conducting batch experiments under denitrifying condition.
   In steady-state operation, 20-30\% of influent nitrogen was emitted as
   N(2)O in the bioreactors with influent COD/N ratio less than 3.5. A
   (15)N tracer study showed that this N(2)O originated from
   denitrification in anoxic phase. However, N(2)O reduction capacity of
   denitrifiers was always larger than NO(3)(-)-N or NO(2)(-)-N reduction
   capacity. II was suggested that a high N(2)O emission rate under low
   COD/N ratio operations was mainly due to endogenous denitrification with
   NO(2)(-)-N in the later part of anoxic phase. This NO(2)(-)-N build-up
   was attributed to the difference between NO(3)(-)-N and NO(2)(-)-N
   reduction capacities, which was the feature observed only in low COD/N
   ratio operations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sonochemical degradation of dichlorvos in a batch reactor is
   investigated. Dichlorvos was irradiated with 500 kHz ultrasound at input
   powers ranging from 86 to 161 W. Acoustic power and sparge gas an two
   factors which greatly affect sonochemical degradation efficiency.
   Increasing total acoustic power input from 86 to 161 W resulted in a
   change in the rate constant from 0.018 +/- 0.001 min(-1) to 0.037 +/-
   0.002 min(-1). The change in rate constant due to sparge gas (Argon,
   Oxygen, and Argon/Oxygen (60/40\% v/v) mixture) at a power of 161 W is
   also investigated, with the Argon/Oxygen mixture giving the highest rate
   constant (0.079 +/- 0.005 min(-1)). Total organic carbon and ion
   chromatographic analyses are employed to determine and quantify major
   degradation products, including dimethyl phosphate, formate, carbon
   dioxide, chloride, and phosphate. The extent of mineralization,
   indicated by a decrease in the total organic carbon, and the formation
   of the various intermediates and products, varies with saturating gas. A
   pathway for dichlorvos decomposition is proposed, based upon formation
   rates of the various intermediates and products and the rate of decrease
   of the total organic carbon in the system. The limiting steps in the
   mineralization pathway appear to be transformation of dimethyl phosphate
   and formate. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   drinking water distribution system (DS). A treated surface water and
   various groundwaters Feed this DS. Parameters related to bacterial
   regrowth have been measured on these samples: temperature,
   concentrations of free residual chlorine, concentration of biodegradable
   dissolved organic carbon (BDOC), abundance of suspended bacteria,
   densities of fixed bacteria and levels of bacterial activity. Results
   showed that groundwaters were less susceptible to favor bacterial
   regrowth in the DS pipes. Treated surface water and mixed waters had the
   highest potential of bacterial regrowth in the DS dead ends. Results
   also showed that the potential regrowth induced by the distribution of a
   treated surface water could be reduced if: (1) the BDOC levels were
   below 0.25 mg C/l at the outlet of the surface water treatment plant:
   (2) a significant free chlorine residual was present within the whole
   DS. Second-stage biological filtration using granular activated carbon
   is now under construction at the surface water treatment plant feeding a
   part of this DS. This treatment implementation should reduce BDOC levels
   and chlorine demand of the treated surface water and will further reduce
   the slight regrowth phenomena observed in this DS. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Soft, low alkalinity drinking waters tend to cause relatively high
   copper corrosion by-product release in plumbing systems. Long-term tests
   (6-8 months) in a synthetic, microbially stable soft tap water confirmed
   that lower pi-Is and higher temperatures increased copper release to
   water. Soluble copper release increased at lower temperature and lower
   pH. Low levels of free chlorine (0.7 mg/L) slightly increased copper
   release at pH 9.5, in marked contrast to the dramatic reductions in
   copper release that have been observed in soft waters in which Type III
   pitting corrosion is occurring. Gum xanthan and sodium alginate produced
   a microbially unstable water that reduced the pH and DO during
   stagnation in pipes - these indirect effects far outweighed their
   possible role in chelation or other modes of direct attack on copper
   surfaces. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A multifed upflow filter (MUF), working under anoxic or anaerobic
   conditions, coupled with an aerobic biofilm airlift suspension (BAS)
   reactor was operated in order to treat a wastewater with high
   formaldehyde (up to 1.5 g L-1) and urea (up to 0.46 g L-1)
   concentrations. In the MUF, formaldehyde removal, denitrification and
   urea hydrolysis took place simultaneously.
   The MUF was operated at 37 degreesC, at a hydraulic retention time (HRT)
   ranging from 1 to 0.3 d. An organic loading rate (OLR) of 0.5
   kg-formaldehyde m(-3) d(-1) was efficiently eliminated during anaerobic
   operation and transformed into methane, while a much higher OLR (up to 2
   kg-formaldehyde m(-3) d(-1)) was oxidised under anoxic conditions by the
   nitrite or nitrate From the nitrifying airlift. However, only 80\% of
   urea was hydrolysed to ammonia in an anoxic environment while complete
   conversion occurred under anaerobic conditions. Moreover, formaldehyde
   concentrations higher than 50 mg L-1 provoked a loss of efficiency of
   urea hydrolysis, decreasing to 10\% at formaldehyde concentrations above
   300 mg L-1 Methane production rate during the anaerobic stage was
   adversely affected by accumulations of formaldehyde in the reactor
   causing lower formaldehyde removal efficiency. However, denitrification
   proceeded properly even at a formaldehyde concentration of 700 mg L-1 in
   the reactor, although nitrous oxide appears in the off-gas. The COD/N
   ratios required For complete nitrite and nitrate denitrification with
   formaldehyde were estimated at 2.1 and 3.5 kg-COD/kg-N, respectively.

Abstract = {{The characteristics of degradation/conversion of bio-refractory and the
   growth of a biofilm are investigated in laboratory-scale pre-ozonation
   and lifted moving-bed biological activated carbon (BAC) advanced
   treatment processes treating phenol, benzoic acid, aminobenzoic acid and
   petrochemical industry wastewater which contains acrylonitrile butadiene
   styrene (ABS). The optimal reaction time and ozone dosage of
   pre-ozonation for bio-refractory conversion were determined to be 30 min
   and 100-200 mg O(3)/hr, respectively. After pre-ozonation of 30 min
   treatment, BOD(5)/COD ratio of influent and effluent increased
   apparently from 20 to 35\% approximately. However, the change of pH in
   pre-ozonation was inconspicuous. The optimal flow rate of influent and
   air were controlled at 1.61/h and 120-150 nl/min in lifted moving-bed
   BAC advanced treatment reactor. A COD removal efficiency of 85-95\% and
   70-90\% may be maintained by using an organic loading of 3.2-6.3 kg
   COD/m(3) day and 0.6-1.6 kg-COD/m(3) day with an HRT of 6.0 h as
   secondary and advanced treatment system, respectively. The time required
   for the BAC bed is be regenerated by a thermal regeneration is prolonged
   4-5 times more than that of GAC system. It can be estimated that the
   enhanced COD removal capability of the biofilm was not only due to the
   increase in the COD removal capability of acclimated bacteria, bur also
   due to species succession of bacteria in bio-film ecosystem. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{This work is the result of a collaboration between Spanish and
   Portuguese laboratories. The specific objective was to quantify the time
   evolution during 1994, 1995 and 1996 of the radioecological impact of
   the liquid releases of H-3 from the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant (ANPP)
   in the section of the Tagus River corresponding to Caceres province in
   Spain and the Alentejo region in Portugal. We found that the temporal
   evolution of the levels of tritium depends on the management of the
   water held in the cooling reservoir of the ANPP and the presence of the
   dams that exist along the river. This management regime has a 12-month
   period. Also the movement of the mass of tritiated water (HTO) downriver
   was much faster during 1996 than 1995 or 1994 due to the hydrological
   differences between those years and consequently to the different
   amounts of water transferred between the reservoirs of the dams. From
   the hypothesis that hydrodynamically it is impossible to differentiate
   tritiated water from non-tritiated water, a model was constructed that
   satisfactorily reproduces the temporal evolution of the 3H in the zone
   of the Tagus River in which the exchange of water takes place, with the
   cooling reservoir of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Groundwater samples from six wells of a former gas plant site were
   characterised using chemical. microbial and ecotoxicological methods.
   Degradation studies were performed in batch-culture under aerobic
   conditions with the groundwater samples containing their autochthonous
   microflora and original contaminant mixture. The highest O-2-consumption
   (3 mmol 100 ml(-1)). combined with BTEX 18.3 mg l(-1)) and naphthalene
   (171.3 mg l(-1)) degradation, as well as formation of organic acids was
   found after N- and P-supplementation with the highest contaminated
   groundwater sample. The other highly polluted groundwater sample showed
   no activity obviously because of the toxicity of some compounds. The
   major part of the PAHs and BTEX was eliminated in the assays with the
   low contaminated groundwater samples. The results indicate that the
   microbial degradation capacity and thereby the natural attenuation
   capaeitv in each groundwater differ and cannot be assessed simply by
   chemical, microbial and toxicological data. Additionally activity tests
   with authentic groundwater samples with and without nutrient
   supplementation are recommended. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Lake Balaton is a large, shallow, and calcareous lake that was subject
   to a rapid eutrophication during the 1970s. Management measures taken
   from the mid 1980s decreased the phosphorus load to the lake from 0.5 to
   0.3 g Pm-2 yr(-1). Using long-term load and water quality data, we
   analyse the response of the formerly hypertrophic Basin 1 of the lake by
   the means of simple empirical models. Several factors that are commonly
   neglected during studies of lake recovery modified the apparent settling
   velocity of total P and consequently, the biomass of the phytoplankton.
   These factors included the loads of calcium and suspended solids, the
   loading ratio of the dissolved to particulate phosphorus, and blooming
   of the dominant cyanobacterium, Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii. Due to
   the rapid immobilisation of the mobile phosphorus in the surface
   sediments, moderate reduction (45-50\%) in the external load resulted in
   a surprisingly fast and significant improvement of the water quality in
   the hypertrophic southwestern basins of the lake, (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A mathematical model of biofiltration McNevin and Barford (1998) has
   been augmented to include speciation. acid:base equilibria and pH
   dependence of adsorptive equilibria. It accurately predicts qualitative
   aspects of dynamic transients observed in an experimental perfusion
   column and supported a mechanism of adsorption by cation exchange with
   acidic functional groups on the surface of pear. It mirrored the
   buffering capacity of Feat when solutions of high and low pH flow over
   the Feat surface. This is a direct result of cation exchange where
   adsorption of cations increases with pH. This buffering capacity makes
   Feat an attractive medium for engineered biological systems which must
   often operate within narrow pH bands to optimise biological activity.

Abstract = {{Delayed petroleum coke, a waste by-product from the oil sand industry,
   was utilized in the production of activated carbon. The activated carbon
   was then evaluated for color and chlorinated organics reduction from
   pulp mill wastewater. The activation of the petroleum coke was evaluated
   using a fixed bed reactor involving carbonization and activation steps
   at temperature of 850 degreesC and using steam as the activation medium.
   The activation results showed that the maximum surface area of the
   activated coke was achieved at an activation period of 4h. The maximum
   surface area occurred at burnoff and water efficiency of 48.5 and
   54.3\%, respectively. Increasing the activation period to 6 h resulted
   in a decrease in the surface area. Methylene blue adsorption results
   indicated that the activation process was successful. Methylene blue
   adsorbed per 100 g of applied activated coke was 10 times higher than
   that adsorbed by raw petroleum coke. Adsorption equilibrium results of
   the bleached wastewater and the activated coke showed that significant
   color, COD, DOC and AOX removal (> 90\%) was achieved when the activated
   coke dose exceeded 15.000 mg/L. Adsorption isotherms, in terms of GOD.
   DOG, UV and color were developed based on the batch equilibrium data.
   Based on these isotherms, the amount of activated coke required to
   achieve certain removal of color and AOX can be predicted. The
   utilization of the petroleum coke for the production of activated carbon
   can provide an excellent disposal option for the oil sand industry at
   the same time would provide a cheap and valuable activated carbon. (C)

Abstract = {{Experimental results from the adsorption and subsequent catalytic
   combustion of the reactive dye Uniblue A on hematite indicate that this
   iron oxide can he used as an affordable catalyst for environmental
   purposes. Uniblue A was adsorbed on hematite and the products of the
   catalytic oxidation in O-2 atmosphere were analyzed by thermal
   programmed gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (STDS-GC-MS) analysis.
   The catalytic combustion of Uniblue A in the presence of hematite led to
   about 40\% conversion of the dye C-content into CO2 at T = 275 degreesC.
   The activation energy (E-a) for the desorption of CO, and other
   polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from the hematite surface was
   determined to be 23.4 kcal mol(-1). Identification of the species of
   Uniblue A in solution and those existing on the hematite surface was
   earned out in the framework of the generalized two-layer diffuse model.
   The modeling of the amount of dye absorbed on hematite is in good
   agreement with the experimental data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides new insights into modelling the distribution of
   hydrophobic compounds between soil and water phases in the presence of
   nonionic surfactant micelles. Experimental measurements were made of
   various systems comprising a non-ionic surfactant, five soils of
   different fractional organic carbon contents, and a hydrophobic
   (disperse) dye. Soil-washing performance was quantified using reciprocal
   surfactant-soil solubilization coefficients (1/K-d). Two stages of
   partitioning were identified. In stage 1, the dye concentration
   increased slightly with increasing surfactant dose until surfactant
   monomers saturated the bulk solution at the critical micelle
   concentration (cmc). The washing performance was 1:1 proportional to the
   surfactant monomer concentration, Most of the surfactant in this stage
   is sorbed. In stage 2, above the cmc, soil-washing performance increased
   linearly with increasing available surfactant micelles in the bulk
   solution. Reciprocal surfactant-soil solubilization coefficients (1/Kd),
   octanol-water partition coefficients (K-ow), fractional organic carbon
   content of the soil (f(oc)) and surfactant concentration were correlated
   for each stage in the soil-washing process using two simple equations.

Abstract = {{A novel multi-electrode system is proposed for electrolytic and
   biological water treatments. The multi-electrode system is comprised of
   multiple working electrodes and their counter electrode, where electric
   current or potential applied to each electrode is controlled
   independently. Experimental result for different electrolyte solutions
   showed that electric charge in the system was efficiently carried by
   dissociative electrolytes such as carbonate ions. This transfer
   mechanism is regarded as being effective both in keeping FH Lever around
   neutrality and in passing certain amounts of electric current especially
   in dilute solutions such as groundwater and surface water. A long-term
   (over 500 days) experiment also showed the enhanced and stable
   denitrification performance of biofilm-electrode reactor (BER) equipped
   with the multi-electrode system, comparing to former BERs. This superior
   performance was thought to be attributable to large effective surface
   area of electrode, the charge transfer mechanism by dissociative
   electrolyte, and the formation of highly reducing (or oxidizing) zones.
   From these results, we conclude that the multi-electrode system is
   useful for electrolytic and biological treatments of groundwater and
   surface water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   aluminum, zinc, mercury, lead, copper. and cadmium onto living
   microalgae were measured. The freshwater green microalga Scenedesmus
   subspicatus. the brackish water diatom Cyclotella cryptica the seawater
   diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and the seawater red alga Porphyridium
   purpureum were the subject of investigation. In most cases the
   adsorption rate of the metals could be well described by using the
   equation of the Langmuir adsorption rate expression. Inverse parameter
   estimation allowed the determination of the rate constants of the
   adsorption process and the maximum metal content of the algae. The
   highest values for the rate constant were obtained for Porphyridium
   purpureum followed by Phaeodactylum tricormutum. High values for the
   maximum content were obtained for Cyclotella cryptica and Scenedesmus
   subspicatus. The maximum rate constant was 24.21 h(-1) for the
   adsorption of Hg to Porphyridium purpureum whereas the maximum metal
   content (0.243 g g(-1)) was obtained for Zn on Cyclotella cryptica. A
   comparison of these values with those obtained for the mineral siliceous
   earth exhibiting low maximum content and high adsorption rates reveals
   that the mechanism of adsorption onto the algae is a mixture of
   adsorption and accumulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The conditioning and dewatering behaviors of chemical and waste
   activated sludges from a tannery were studied. Capillary suction time
   (CST), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), and bound water. content
   were used to evaluate the sludge dewatering behaviors. Zeta potentials
   were also measured. Experiments were conducted on each sludge
   conditioned and dewatered separately, and on the sludge mixed at various
   ratios. Results indicate that the chemical sludge was relatively
   difficult to be dewatered, even in the presence of polyelectrolyte. When
   the waste activated sludge was mixed with the chemical sludge at ratios
   of 1 : 1 and 2 : 1, respectively, the dewaterability of chemical sludge
   improved remarkably while the relatively better dewaterability of the
   waste activated sludge deteriorated only to a limited extent. As the
   mixing ratios became 4 : 1 and 8 : 1, the dewaterability of the mixed
   sludge was equal to that of the waste activated sludge. The optimal
   polyelectrolyte dosage for the mixed sludge was equal to or less than
   that of the waste activated sludge. It is proposed that the chemical
   sludges act as skeleton builders that reduce the compressibility of the
   mixed sludge whose dewaterability is enhanced. Bound water contents of
   sludge decreased at low polyelectrolyte dosage and were not
   significantly affected as polyelectrolyte dosage increased. Advantages
   and disadvantages of co-conditioning and dewatering chemical sludge and
   waste activated sludge were discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Fluvial suspended particulates collected from the Rhine River were

   Elemental analysis and Diffuse Reflectance infrared Spectroscopy reveal

   resin-embedded samples and structural characterization from break-up
   experiments. show that fluvial particulate matter should be viewed as
   fractal aggregates organized by bacterial exopolymeric substances. The
   shape of particulate size distribution suggests that the formation and

Abstract = {{The roles of substrate complexity (molecular size of the substrate) and
   process configuration in anaerobic wastewater treatment were
   investigated to determine optimal methanogenic technology parameters.
   Five substrates (glucose, propionate, butyrate, ethanol, and lactate)
   plus a mixed waste (60\% carbohydrate, 34\% protein, and 6\% lipids)
   were studied under five reactor configurations: batch-fed single-stage
   continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), continuously fed single-stage
   CSTR, two-phase CSTR, two-stage CSTR, and single-stage upflow anaerobic
   sludge blanket (UASB). The substrate feed concentration was 20,000 mg/L
   as COD. The solids retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention lime
   (HRT) in the CSTR reactors were 20 d, while HRT in the UASB was 2d. All
   reactors were operated for at least 60 d (equal to 3SRT).
   Substrate complexity was observed to be less significant under
   two-phase, two-stage and UASB reactor configurations. Two-phase CSTR,
   two-stage CSTR, and single-stage UASB configurations yielded the lowest
   effluent chemical oxygen demands (130-550, 60-700, and 50-250 mg/L,
   respectively). The highest effluent chemical oxygen demands were
   detected when feeding glucose, propionate, and lactate to continuously
   fed single-stage CSTRs (10, 400, 9900, and 4700 mg/L GOD, respectively)
   and to batch-fed single-stage CSTRs (11, 200, 2500, and 2700 mg/L GOD,
   respectively). Ironically, the one stage CSTR most commonly utilized in
   the field - was the worst possible reactor configuration. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the coagulation mechanism by the purified
   coagulant solution (MOC-SC-PC) with the coagulation active component
   extracted from M. oleifera seeds using salt solution. The addition of
   MOC-SC-PC tap water formed insoluble matters. This formation was
   responsible for kaolin coagulation On the other hand, insoluble matters
   were not formed when the MOC-SC-PC was added into distilled water. The
   formation was affected by Ca2+ or other bivalent cations which may
   connect each molecule of the active coagulation component in MOC-SC-PC
   and form a net-like structure. The coagulation mechanism of MOC-SC-PC
   seemed to bt an enmeshment of Kaolin by the insoluble matters with the
   net-like structure. In case of Ca2+ ion (bivalent cations), at least
   0.2mM was necessary for coagulation at 0.3 mgC l(-1) dose of MOC-SC-PC,
   Other coagulation mechanisms like compression of double layer,
   interparticle bridging or charge neutralization were not responsible for
   the coagulation by MOC-SC-PC. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The extracellular polymer produced by a bacterium isolated from soil was
   employed in laboratory studies of desorption of a model polynuclear
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), phenanthrene. The experimental results show
   that the selected extracellular polymer enhances the extent of release
   of soil-bound phenanthrene. A kinetic model was developed as an aid in
   interpreting the alterations in phenanthrene desorption resulting from
   polymer addition. The model employs a statistical gamma (gamma)
   distribution to describe spectrum of rate constants for transfer of
   phenanthrene from soil to water, and assumes instantaneous binding of
   phenanthrene to polymer and of polymer to the test soil. The relevant
   distribution coefficients and statistical parameters of the gamma
   distribution needed for the model were evaluated in independent
   experiments. Using these measured parameters, the model provides a
   satisfactory independent prediction of phenanthrene release from soil to
   aqueous phase at two test polymer concentrations, 50 mg TOC/L and 100 mg
   TOC/L. The success of the independent model predictions suggests a
   mechanism for the influence of extracellular polymer on phenanthrene
   desorption. The intrinsic, soil-specific, rate constants for solid to
   solution transfer of phenanthrene do not appear to be changed by
   bacterial polymer. Instead, polymer binding of phenanthrene in solution
   results in an increase in driving force for desorption by decreasing the
   solution concentration of the free, unbound, PAH molecule. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{We present results of one year observations in highly heterotrophic and
   oxygen-depleted rivers of the polluted Scheldt basin. Monthly
   measurements revealed a high variability for dissolved inorganic carbon
   and nitrogen, with the following strong parallelism: highest alkalinity
   and NH4+ were associated with lowest NO3- and oxygen and vice-versa. In
   river water incubations, nitritication lowered the alkalinity whereas
   denitrification raised it; in an anoxic, NO3- -free incubation an
   increase of alkalinity was observed, partially due to ammonification. A
   stoichiometric analysis, taking into account the amount of protons
   produced or consumed by each process involving nitrogen, revealed that
   monthly variations of NO3- and NH4+ with ammonification, nitrification
   and denitrification could explain the 28 and 62\% alkalinity variations
   at all stations, except one. The remaining part of the alkalinity
   variations was attributed to other anaerobic processes (Mn-, Fe- and
   SO4-reductions). This trend seems to be the result of the whole
   catchment metabolism (riverine waters and sediments, sewage networks and
   agricultural soils). The observed HCO concentrations in the Scheldt
   basin were 2-10 times higher than the representative concentrations
   reported in pristine basins and used in chemical weathering models. This
   suggests the existence of an anthropogenic source, originating From
   organic matter decomposition. We conclude that in highly polluted
   basins, nitrogen transformations strongly influence the acid-base
   properties of water. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This is a state-of-science review of interrelationships between the
   sorption/desorption behaviors and chemical structures of natural organic
   matter MOM) matrices associated with soils, sediments and aquifer
   materials. It identifies similarities between these behavior-property
   interrelationships for natural geosorbents and those for synthetic
   organic polymers. It then invokes, with appropriate restrictions and
   modifications. several structure-function relationships that have been
   developed for synthetic polymers to explain the behavior of NOM matrices
   with respect to the sorption and desorption of hydrophobic organic
   contaminants (HOCs). Previous research regarding HOC sorption and
   desorption by different types of NOM and by synthetic polymers is
   summarized, and research requirements for further refinement of the
   NOM-polymer analogy are examined. The discussion focuses on structural
   and compositional heterogeneities that exist at the particle and
   aggregate scale, a scale at which homogeneity is commonly, and often
   improperly, assumed in the development of contaminant fate and transport
   models. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for the
   specific, sensitive detection of virulent Shigella spp. in spiked
   environmental water samples was developed. A set of primers specific for
   the invasion plasmid antigen gene (ipaH) of virulent Shigella spp, and
   enteroinvasive Escherichia coli produced a 620-bp fragment that was used
   as template for the seminested primer pair delineating a 401-bp
   fragment. By using agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the
   seminested PCR-amplified products, a detection limit of 1.6 x 10(3) cfu
   S. flexneri was Obtained with amplification reactions from crude
   bacterial lysates. The PCR procedure coupled with an enrichment culture
   incubated for 6 h detected as few as 1.6 S. flexneri organisms in pure
   culture. Treated sewage, ground, surface and drinking water samples
   collected from various sources were seeded with S. flexneri and
   incubated in GN broth for 6 h before detection by seminested PCR. A
   detection limit lower than I 14 cfu/ml was achieved in some water
   samples. The results indicate that the described seminested PCR has the
   advantage of a rapid turnaround time and it fulfills the requirements of
   sensitivity and specificity for use in an environmental laboratory. (C)

Abstract = {{In this research, the influence of two natural organic polymers
   (polysaccharide and humic acid) on the stability of colloidal aggregates
   was examined. The primary objective of this research was to determine
   whether addition of organic matter to flee suspensions results in the
   fragmentation or stabilization of aggregates. A second objective was to
   determine how the size of aggregates and the composition of organic
   matter influence the floc breakup or stabilization process. It was found
   that the stability of aggregates depended on the type of organic
   material present as well as hoc size. For example, humic acid increased
   the stability of aggregates more effectively than polysaccharides of
   larger size. It was also found that the addition of humic acid or
   polysaccharide generally decreased the rate of coagulation of small
   aggregates but had less influence on large aggregates. In no case did
   the addition of polysaccharide or humic acid result in the fragmentation
   of particle aggregates. The existence of strong interparticle forces
   within flocs prevented aggregate breakup upon adsorption of natural
   organic polymers. The results presented here provide important new
   information regarding the influence of NOM on the behavior of particles
   in aquatic systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Resin acids are the major toxicants in pulp and paper mill effluents
   (PPMEs), and they form pitch interfering with papermaking. Efficient and
   reliable resin acid removal is critically important to prevent toxicity
   discharge and ensure proper functioning of paper machines. Two
   resin-acid-degrading bacteria, Pseudomonas abietaniphila BKME-9 and
   Zoogloea resiniphila DhA-35, were tested in laboratory sequencing batch
   reactors (SBRs) for their ability to enhance resin acid removal by
   biomass from a full-scale biotreatment system treating PPMEs. Both
   bacteria enhanced resin acid removal but not removal of total organic
   carbon (TOC) by either pH-shocked or starved activated sludge. These two
   bacteria also increased resin acid removal when the sludge was given
   high concentration (200 muM) of resin acid. A most-probable-number
   polymerase chain reaction (MPN-PCR) assay showed that these two bacteria
   were initially not detectable (detection limit: 10(2) bacterial
   cells/ml) in the sludge community and were persistent after inoculation.
   Both bacteria did not substantially change the indigenous microbial
   community composition, as assayed by ribosomal intergenic spacer
   analysis (RISA). Our results suggest that it is feasible and potentially
   useful to enhance resin acid removal by bioaugmentation using
   resin-acid-degrading bacteria such as BKME-9 and DhA-35. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Biological removal of the ozonation by-product, bromate, was
   demonstrated in biologically active carbon (BAC) filters. For example,
   with a 20-min EBCT, pH 7.5, and influent dissolved oxygen (DO) and
   nitrate concentrations 2.1 and 5.1 mg/l, respectively, 40\% bromate
   removal was obtained with a 20 mug/l influent bromate concentration. In
   this study, DO, nitrate and sulfate concentrations, pH, and type of
   source water were evaluated for their effect on bromate removal in a BAC
   filter. Bromate removal decreased as the influent concentrations of DO
   and nitrate increased, but bromate removal was observed in the presence
   of measurable effluent concentrations of DO and nitrate. In contrast,
   bromate removal was not sensitive to the influent sulfate concentration,
   with only a slight reduction in bromate removal as the influent sulfate
   concentration was increased from 11.1 to 102.7 mg/l. Bromate reduction
   was better at lower pH values (6.8 and 7.2) than at higher pH values
   (7.5 and 8.2), suggesting that it may be possible to reduce bromate
   formation during ozonation and increase biological bromate reduction
   through pH control. Biological bromate removal in Lake Michigan water
   was very poor as compared to that in tapwater from a groundwater source.
   Bromate removal improved when sufficient organic electron donor was
   added to remove the nitrate and DO present in the Lake Michigan water,
   indicating that the poor biodegradability of the natural organic matter
   may have been limiting bromate removal in that water. Biological bromate
   removal was demonstrated to be a sustainable process under a variety of
   water quality conditions, and bromate removal can be improved by
   controlling key water quality parameters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{POTAMON is a unidimensional, non-stationary model, designed for
   simulating potamo-plankton from source to mouth. The forcing variables
   are discharge, river morphology, water temperature, available light and
   nutrient inputs. Given the description of several algal categories,
   POTAMON allows to simulate algal ``successions{''} at a particular site,
   as well as longitudinal changes of potamoplankton composition and
   biomass. The algal categories differ by their physiology, their loss
   rates, and their sensitivity to grazing by zooplankton. Two zooplankton
   categories were considered, Brachionus-like and Keratella-like. which
   differ by their clearance rate, their incipient limiting level, their
   selectivity towards phytoplankton, and their growth yield. The model
   simulates satisfactorily the onset and the magnitude of the
   phytoplankton spring bloom in the Belgian part of R. Meuse, the biomass
   decrease in early summer, and the autumn bloom. It also renders the
   major variations of algal assemblages along the river. The model allows
   to confirm that the main driving variables of potamoplankton dynamics in
   a eutrophic river are physical factors: discharge and related variables
   (e.g. retention time), light and temperature. In addition, the
   simulations confirm that the zooplankton-phytoplankton interaction may
   result in phytoplankton biomass fluctuations and compositional changes.
   POTAMON can be useful to explore plankton dynamics in a large river, and
   it may become a tool to test various management measures. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Composting is commonly used as an effective means of stabilizing
   wastewater biosolids and reducing pathogens to very low concentrations.
   However, it has been shown that under certain conditions Salmonella can
   regrow in previously composted biosolids. Growth of seeded Salmonella
   typhimurium in composted biosolids ranging from two weeks to two years
   maturity was monitored. Results from sterile and non-sterile composted
   biosolids were compared. Seeded S. typhimurium colonized rapidly in
   sterilized biosolids reaching a maximum population density of more than
   10(8) g(-1). Growth of seeded S. typhimurium was suppressed in
   non-sterilized compost with a maximum population density of less than
   10(3) g(-1). There was a significant decline in the growth rate of
   seeded Salmonella in sterilized compost when the compost was stored,
   suggesting that bio-available nutrients declined with storage. However,
   in non-sterilized compost this was not the case. This suggests that the
   indigenous microflora play a significant role in suppression of
   Salmonella regrowth in composted biosolids. There was a strong negative
   correlation (-0.85) between the Salmonella inactivation rate and the
   maturity of compost in non-sterilized compost. The Salmonella
   inactivation rate was seven times higher in biosolids composting for two
   weeks as compared to compost stored for two years. This suggests that
   the antagonistic effect of indigenous microorganisms towards Salmonella
   declined with compost storage. It was concluded that all composted
   biosolids had a Salmonella regrowth potential. However, the indigenous
   microflora significantly reduced this regrowth potential, Long-term
   storage of compost is not recommended as this map increase the pathogen
   regrowth potential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spent bleaching liquors from pulp bleached with chlorine dioxide were
   assessed for their potency to induce hepatic mixed function oxygenase
   enzymes (MFO) in rainbow trout, as indicated by activity of
   ethoxyresorufin-o-deethyase (EROD). Filtrates were collected from two
   kraft mills in Central Canada to assess the potency of filtrates from
   hardwood and softwood bleaching. All mill-scale bleaching filtrates
   induced MFO activity, and filtrates from softwood pulp bleaching
   appeared more potent than filtrates from hardwood bleaching. Filtrates
   from the final bleaching stage were most potent, and filtrates from the
   first stage were the least potent. In laboratory bench-scale bleaching
   experiments, pulp from softwood and hardwood kraft mills in Eastern
   Canada was bleached via an industry-standard 5-stage chlorine dioxide
   bleaching sequence. The filtrates were collected and used in fish
   bioassays to assess EROD-inducing potency. Potency of bench-scale
   filtrates varied depending on wood furnish (i.e. softwood vs. hardwood)
   and the bleaching stage, with all bench-scale filtrates being much
   weaker EROD inducers than mill-scale filtrates. Recycled paper mill
   washwater is a possible source of compounds causing increased potency of
   the mill-scale filtrates. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Domestic and wine-distillery wastewaters were treated by semi-batch and
   continuous pH sequential ozonations. The process involves a succession
   of acidic and alkaline wastewater pH conditions. The alkaline periods
   allow oxidation of organic matter by hydroxyl radical and produce
   carbonates that eventually would inhibit the oxidation. On the other
   hand, the acidic periods favour the development of direct ozone
   reactions and strip off carbonates as carbon dioxide from the
   wastewater. Experimental results of pH sequential ozonation showed
   degradation and removal rates of wastewater pollutants higher than those
   achieved at constant either acidic or basic pH. The most significant
   improvement of ozone efficiency and pollutants removal were obtained by
   controlling the number of cycles, pH and time of acidic and alkaline
   phases. Also, ozonated wastewaters showed high biodegradability as
   deduced from their BOD/COD ratios. The feasibility of treating domestic
   and wine-distillery wastewater by an integrated activated sludge
   (ASP)-pH sequential ozonation system was evaluated. Integrated
   ASP-ozonation at constant pH processes were also carried out for
   comparative purposes. In these combined experiments, pH sequential
   ozonation showed advantages compared to ozonation at constant pH in
   reducing global parameters such as COD, TOC and TKN, but ozonation at
   constant pH led to higher removal of polyphenols and UV254 absorbing
   compounds. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The removal of Cu(II) by a mesoporous material, FSM-16, was studied
   using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and surface
   complexation modeling (SCM). Free copper ions, adsorbed and precipitated
   Cu(II) species were qualitatively identified by in situ EPR spectroscopy
   of Cu-FSM-16 suspensions at room temperature and at 77 K. In addition,
   the adsorbed species was identified as a Cu(II) species with an axial
   symmetry from an analysis of the EPR spectra of ``dry{''} Cu-FSM-16 at
   77 K. On the basis of the EPR results, the removal of Cu(II) as a
   function of pH under various experimental conditions was successfully
   simulated by assuming two removal mechanisms such as surface
   complexation and surface precipitation. In the acidic pH range (<pH 6),
   free copper ions were predominant, and surface complexed then surface
   precipitated species became dominant as the pH increased. (C) 2001

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved concentrations were determined for Fe, Mn, Al, Cu, Zn, La, U,
   Th, Cd and As in a wetland and its recipient stream to reveal the effect
   of seasonal changes in environmental conditions on the cycling and
   transfer of trace elements at the transition between terrestrial and
   aquatic ecosystems. These preliminary results from the wetland show
   marked seasonal changes in dissolved concentration for all elements
   except Zn and Cu. Concentrations are found to be low until about
   mid-February and then increase abruptly. The onset of trace element
   release appears to coincide with a marked decline in redox potential and
   increase of organic carbon content. Because this decline is itself
   correlated with a pronounced increase in temperature and dissolved Fe,
   Mn and organic carbon content, we suggest that the microorganisms which
   use soil iron and manganese oxy-hydroxides as electron accepters
   catalyzed the change in redox conditions and induced an increase of DOC.
   Temporal changes were also observed in the recipient stream which showed
   marked positive concentration peaks during stormflow events (except Zn).
   The seasonal processes occurring in the wetland appear to play a major
   role in determining the amount of trace elements which are transferred
   from the wetland to the river. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Four three-dimensional lysimeters were established in a pilot laboratory
   with the same medium sand and either an aggregate-laden (AL) or
   aggregate-free (AF) infiltration surface and a 60- or 90-cm soil vadose
   zone depth to ground water. During 48 weeks of operation, each lysimeter
   was dosed 4 rimes daily with septic tank effluent (STE) at 5 cm/d (AL)
   or 8.4 cm/d (AF). Weekly monitoring was done to characterize the STE,
   percolate flow and composition, and water content distributions within
   the lysimeters. Bromide tracer tests were completed at weeks 0, 8, and
   45 and during the latter two times, ice nucleating active (INA) bacteria
   and MS-2 and PRD-1 bacteriophages were used as bacterial and viral
   surrogates. After 48 weeks, soil cores were collected and analyzed for
   chemical and microbial properties. The observations made during this
   study revealed a dynamic, interactive behavior for hydraulic and
   purification processes that were similar for all four lysimeters. Media
   utilization and bromide retention times increased during the first two
   months of operation with the median bromide breakthrough exceeding one
   day at start-up and increasing to two days or more. Purification
   processes were gradually established over four months or longer, after
   which there were high removal efficiencies (>90\%) for organic
   constituents, microorganisms, and virus, but only limited removal of
   nutrients. Soil core analyses revealed high biogeochemical activity
   within the infiltrative zone from 0 to 15 cm depth. All four lysimeters
   exhibited comparable behavior and there were no significant differences
   in performance attributable to infiltrative surface character or soil
   depth. It is speculated that the comparable performance is due to a
   similar and sufficient degree of soil clogging genesis coupled with
   bioprocesses that effectively purified the wastewater effluent given the
   adequate retention times and high volumetric utilization's of the sand
   media. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to define operating conditions which
   would conciliate a high removal of the five metallic cations (Cu2+,
   Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+) and a low desorption of these metal ions from
   the contaminated sorbents. To achieve this goal the strategy relied on
   the use of experimental design methodology. The influence of four
   parameters (fly ash/lime mass ratio, type of fly ash/lime sorbent
   solution temperature, and sorbent concentration) on the removal at pH =
   5 and the stabilization of the five metallic ions was studied. In the
   first step, the influence of three parameters on the removal of Cu2+
   ions was studied (R-2 = fly ash/lime mass ratio, type of sorbent,
   temperature). It was found that the same set of parameter values would
   produce both the highest removal and the lowest desorption for this
   cation: R-2 = 9g g(-1), sorbent B (made by mixing fly ash and lime in
   water, then drying this paste at 105 degreesC for 24 h), temperature of
   suspension equal to 60 degreesC. The formation of calcium silicate
   hydrate (CSH), resulting from the pozzolanic activity of fly ash, is
   assumed to be partially responsible for these mechanisms. In the second
   step, simplex methodology and Doehlert matrix were used to find the
   conditions in a 2D space (sorbent concentration, temperature of
   solution) that would give the highest removal from a solution containing
   five metallic cations and the lowest desorption of these five cations
   adsorbed on the contaminated sorbents. Then, the system response that
   had to be optimized was the total metallic ions concentration (TMIC, mol
   L-1). A TMIC was measured both for adsorption and leaching experiments.
   These responses were modelized using a second-order polynomial and the
   surface responses were plotted for adsorption and desorption results. A
   difference was observed between operating conditions reaching the
   highest adsorption from those that gave the lowest desorption. However,
   an adsorbent concentration around 122 g L-1 and a solution temperature
   of 66 degreesC would lead simultaneously to a high adsorption and a low
   desorption. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminant degradation, stoichiometry, and role of hydroxyl radicals
   (OH) in four Fenton's systems were investigated using trichloroethylene
   (TCE as a model contaminant. A standard Fenton's system, a modified
   soluble iron system with a pulse input of hydrogen peroxide, and two
   modified mineral-catalyzed systems (pH 3 and 7) were studied. In the
   standard Fenton's system, which had the most efficient reaction
   stoichiometry, 78\% of the TCE was degraded; however, chloride analysis
   indicated that no more than two of the three chlorines were displaced
   per TCE molecule degraded. Although the modified soluble iron system was
   characterized by 91\% TCE degradation, chloride analysis also indicated
   that no more than two of the chlorines were lost from the TCE. In the
   goethite system of pH 3. > 99\% of the TCE was degraded. Near-complete
   release of chloride suggested that the TCE may have been mineralized.
   Only 22\% degradation of TCE was achieved in the pH 7 goethite system,
   and there was minimal release of chloride. The mineral-catalyzed
   reactions exhibited the least efficient reaction stoichiometry of the
   four systems. Experiments using hydroxyl radical scavengers showed that
   the standard Fenton's system degraded TCE entirely by hydroxyl radical
   mechanisms, while approximately 10-15\% of the degradation achieved in
   the modified soluble iron and goethite-catalyzed systems at pH 3 was
   mediated by non-hydroxyl radical mechanisms. In the goethite system at
   pH 7, only non-hydroxyl radical mechanisms were found. The
   goethite-catalyzed system at pH 3 effectively degraded the parent
   compound and may have the potential to mineralize contaminants when used
   for in situ soil and groundwater remediation and ex situ waste stream
   treatment in packed-bed reactors. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) was concentrated from natural waters and
   the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant using a portable reverse
   osmosis (RO) system. The humic acid (HA), fulvic acid (FA) and
   hydrophilic (HyI) fractions were isolated and purified by the XAD-8
   resin combined with the cation exchange resin method. The FA fractions
   predominated in natural waters and accounted for 54-68\% of the total
   amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), whereas the HA and HyI
   fractions constituted, respectively, 13-29 and 9-30\% of the total DOG.
   The effluent of wastewater was almost devoid of HA and the HyI fraction
   exceeded FA. The elemental compositions of HA and FA were in the ranges
   typical for natural humic materials, but the HyI fractions did nor
   exhibit humic character. (1)H NMR spectra revealed that the HyI
   fractions were almost devoid of aromatic protons and the aliphatic
   region featured more sharp signals than HA and FA fractions, indicating
   that HyI fractions were consisted of more simple compounds and less
   complex mixtures. The aliphatic functional groups in these fractions of
   DOM samples followed the order HA < FA < HyI. Proton titrations
   indicated that HA, FA and HyI fractions of DOM samples from different
   sources had similar total acidity whose range was 9.0-11.6 meq/g C. This
   similarity may be due to the sample fractionation method. The copper
   titration results showed that the number of total Cu binding sites for
   the three fractions of different DOM samples were guile similar
   (1.46-1.60 mmol/gC), which was consistent with the similarity in total
   acidity from proton titrations. The affinity of copper with each
   isolated fraction followed the order HA approximate to FA > HyI. The
   rate of Cu complexation with the HyI fraction was faster than the rate
   with the HA or FA fraction of the Suwannee River DOM, implying that
   copper reacted with relatively weak ligands faster than with strong
   ligands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A distributed water quality model for nonpoint source pollution modeling
   in agricultural watersheds is described in this paper. A water quality
   component was developed for WATFLOOD (a flood forecast hydrological
   model) to deal with sediment and nutrient transport. The model uses a
   distributed group response unit approach for water quantity and quality
   modeling. Runoff, sediment yield and soluble nutrient concentrations are
   calculated separately for each land cover class, weighted by area and
   then routed downstream. With data extracted using Geographical
   Information Systems (GIS) technology for a local watershed, the model is
   calibrated for the hydrologic response and validated for the water
   quality component. The transferability of model parameters to other
   watersheds, especially those in remote areas without enough data for
   calibration, is a major problem in diffuse modeling. With the connection
   to GIS and the group response unit approach used in this paper, model
   portability increases substantially, which will improve nonpoint source
   modeling at the watershed-scale level. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{Excessive algal growth in drinking water sources like lakes and
   reservoirs is responsible for filter-clogging, undesirable taste and
   odor, disinfection-by-product formation and toxin generation. Although
   various methods are currently being used to control algal bloom, their
   successes are limited. Some water utilities routinely use copper sulfate
   to control excessive algal growth. But there is a growing concern
   against its use mainly because it is non-specific to target algae and
   kills many non-target species. In this study. the scope of using
   UV-radiation to control algal growth was assessed using Microcystis
   aeruginosa as test species. A UV-dose of 75 mW scm(-2) was found to be
   lethal to M. aeruginosa. A smaller dose of 37 mW scm(-2) prevented
   growth for about 7 days. It was found that UV-radiation may increase the
   specific gravity of the cells and thus may adversely affect the ability
   of the cells to remain in suspension. Three days after a UV-dose of 75
   mW scm(-2). almost an the cells settled to the bottom of the incubation
   tubes, whereas all the unirradiated cells remained in suspension. It was
   also observed that UV-radiation on algal extracellular products has a
   significant residual effect and can contribute to alga growth control.
   The extent of residual effect depends on the UV-dose and can continue
   even for 7 days. UV-radiation was found to produce H2O2 in the muM level
   concentration. But at such level, H2O2 itself is not likely to cause the
   residual effect that was found in this study. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{Aromatic organic compounds are degraded by different enzyme systems
   under aerobic and anoxic conditions. This raises the question of how
   bacteria in biological nitrogen removal processes, which cycle bacteria
   between aerobic and anoxic environments, regulate their enzyme systems
   for degrading aromatic compounds. As a first step in answering that
   question, mixed microbial communities were grown on benzoate as sole
   carbon source in chemostats under fully aerobic and fully anoxic
   (nitrate as the electron acceptor) conditions and tested for their
   ability to degrade benzoate in batch reactors after exposure to aerobic
   or anoxic conditions in the absence of substrate. Aerobically grown
   biomass retained its ability to degrade benzoate without loss of
   activity after endogenous exposure to aerobic conditions for up to 8 h.
   However, when exposed to anoxic conditions, the biomass rapidly lost its
   aerobic benzoate degrading activity, retaining less than 20\% of the
   initial activity after 8 h. Similarly, anoxically grown biomass retained
   its ability to degrade benzoate without loss of activity after
   endogenous exposure to anoxic conditions for up to 8h. However, when
   anoxically grown biomass was exposed to aerobic conditions. only 20\% of
   its initial activity was lost in the first 2 h: after which the
   remaining activity was retained for up to 8 h. Similar experiments with
   pyruvate showed that the 20\% loss of activity was not due to loss of
   denitrifying enzymes, suggesting that it was due to loss of catabolic
   enzymes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A recirculating system of aqueous trichloroethylene (TCE) solutions
   through the packed bed reactor with TiO(2) pellets has been developed in
   order to mineralize TCE without difficulties for filtration and recovery
   of catalyst. The TiO(2) pellets prepared by sol-gel method have
   photocatalytic activity similar to commercially available PC-101 and
   PC-102 in the powder form and to ST-B11 pellets. in batch experiments
   with TiO(2) powders, Degussa P-25 is the most active photocatalyst,
   which indicates that specific surface area is not an important factor
   controlling the photocatalytic activity in aqueous solutions. The
   degradation rates of TCE in the recirculating system with TiO(2) pellets
   decreased in the presence of H(2)O(2), while were remarkably accelerated
   by adding S(2)O(8)(2-). The presence of S(2)O(8)(2-) ions more than 0.01
   mod dm (-3) completely suppressed hole-electron recombination and
   mineralized 50 ppm TCE with the 2h irradiation. In a reactor without
   TiO(2) photocatalysts, TCE was photodegraded by SO; radicals which
   produced by photodissociation of S(2)O(8)(2-). The degradation rates
   increased with increase of the initial S(2)O(8)(2-) concentration.
   However, ICE was not mineralized but converted to intermediates which
   were slowly degraded to Cl(-) by continuing the irradiation. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Reduction of excess sludge in an oxic-settling-anoxic (OSA) activated
   sludge process might be attributed to a ``sludge fasting (insufficient
   food under an anoxic condition)/feasting (sufficient food under an oxic
   condition){''} treatment. This paper was to examine this explanation by
   investigating both the sludge fasting/feasting phenomenon and the effect
   of a fasting/feasting treatment on sludge growth. In this study, five
   different activated sludge cultures cultivated using synthetic
   wastewater composed of mainly glucose and other necessary nutrients:
   (1)an aerobic batch culture, (2) an intermittently aerated batch
   culture, (3) an anoxic batch culture, (4) a continuous aerobic culture,
   and (5) an OSA culture, were employed. It was found that only the
   aerobic batch culture and the aerobic continuous culture are fastable
   when the oxidation reduction potential (ORP) level is below 100 mV under
   no-food condition during a 2-h fasting treatment. showing that both the
   biomass and carbohydrate storage of these two cultures were reduced
   after the treatment.
   When the fasted cultures were treated in a feasting environment, an
   accumulation of carbohydrate storage did not occur, while specific
   oxygen uptake rates (SOUR) showed a sharp increase. Both the substrate
   utilization and biomass growth rates were also accelerated. It was
   therefore confirmed that a sludge feasting did occur after a fasting
   treatment for the fastable cultures. However, an increase in sludge ATP
   content was not brought about by the feasting treatment. The sludge
   fasting/feasting treatment in this paper could not induce a reduction of
   the observed growth yield (Yobs) in all the cultures cultivated with
   glucose-based synthetic wastewater. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Six upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors were concurrently
   operated for 146d to examine the effects of calcium on the sludge
   granulation process during start-up. introduction of Ca2+ at
   concentrations from 150 to 300 mg/l enhanced the biomass accumulation
   and granulation process. The calcium concentration in the granules was
   nearly proportional to the calcium concentration in the feed, and
   calcium carbonate was the main calcium precipitate in the granules. The
   specific activity of granules decreased with increasing influent calcium
   concentration. The optimum calcium concentration for the granulation was
   from 150 to 300 mg/l. The addition of low-concentration calcium to the
   UASB reactors appeared to enhance the three steps of sludge granulation:
   adsorption, adhesion and multiplication, but it did not lead to a
   different proliferation of of predominant microorganisms in the
   granules. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We report the results of experiments designed to improve the efficacy of

   effects of periodic agitation. covering the rear surface of the
   container with aluminium foil, container volume and turbidity on the
   solar inactivation kinetics of Escherichia coli (starting population=
   10(6) CFU ml(-1)) were investigated. It was shown that agitation
   promoted the release of dissolved oxygen from water with subsequent
   decrease in the inactivation rates of E. coli. In contrast, covering the
   rear surface of the solar disinfection container with aluminium foil
   improved the inactivation efficiency of the system. The mean decay
   constant for bacterial populations in foil-backed bottles was found to
   be a factor of 1.85 (std. dev. =0.43) higher than that of
   non-foil-backed bottles. Inactivation rates decrease as turbidity
   increases. However, total inactivation was achievable in 300 NTU samples
   within 8 h exposure to strong sunshine. Inactivation kinetics was not
   dependent on the volume of the water container for volumes in the range
   500-1500 ml. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an
   engineered shallow water cover in reducing the oxidation of sulfidic
   mine tailings and thus preventing the development of acid rock drainage.
   Fresh tailings were submerged under a 0.3-m water cover in experimental
   field cells. From 1996 to 1998, we followed the chemistry of the
   interstitial water near the tailings-overlying water interface using dr
   situ dialysis, and determined pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles
   across the tailing-water interface using micro-electrodes. Penetration
   of DO into the tailings was limited to <7 mm, even in the presence of DO
   produced by benthic periphyton. Anoxia in the tailings was further
   demonstrated by the appearance of dissolved <Sigma>H2S, Fe and Mn in
   pore water at depths - 1.5cm below the interface. However, there was
   clear evidence of surface oxidation of the mine tailings at the mm scale
   (i.e., DO depletion, coupled with localized increases in {[}H+] and
   {[}SO42-]). Mobilization of Cd and Zn from this surface layer was
   indicated hv the presence of sub-surface peaks in the concentrations of
   these two metals in the tailings interstitial water and by a change in
   their solid phase partitioning from refractory to more labile fractions.
   In contrast. mobilization of Cu from tailings was less evident. Unlike
   previous reports, which suggested that submerged tailings were
   effectively inert, our results show alteration of the superficial layer
   over time. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of the ozonation of three phenolic acids is investigated
   from ozone absorption experiments in a semi-continuous reactor. After
   the evaluation of stoichiometric ratios for the individual reactions
   between ozone and each phenolic acid, the oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic
   acid by ozone is performed in a first stage. The influence of the
   operating variables on the degradation process is established, and the
   application of a mass transfer with chemical reaction model based on the
   film theory leads to the determination of the reaction orders and
   kinetic rate constants. The experimental absorption rates obtained agree
   well with those calculated theoretically. In the second stage, a mixture
   of ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid), beta -resorcylic
   acid (2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid) and p-hydroxybenzoic acid is ozonated
   under different experimental conditions. The kinetic study is performed
   by means of a competitive method that takes p-hydroxybenzoic acid as
   reference compound. The application of this model allows to determine
   the kinetic rate constants for each compound, which are correlated as a
   function of pH and temperature. The results obtained support that the
   kinetic regime of absorption is fast and pseudo-first order with respect
   to ozone, a condition required by the competitive method used. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Current soil-waste-vent (SWV) system design guides aim to produce
   ventilated drainage networks for buildings which protect attached water
   trap seals from unwanted air pressure effects. Such effects may cause
   trap seal failure that are caused by airflow induction during discharge.
   The ventilation design guides are based on steady-state experiments
   utilising cold clean water as a test media. However, most `grey' and
   `black' water sources are dosed with detergent, and are often warm,
   which significantly alters the behaviour when compared to clean water.
   Thus, current design standards provide only approximations of SWV system
   response. Results indicate that induced airflows in warm detergent-dosed
   water can be significantly higher than those measured in clean water
   systems, by a factor of more than 2. This paper quantifies the effect of
   detergents in SWV systems in terms of observed air entrainment rates and
   previously published research on the factors that contribute to air
   entrainment. Results of previous work are cast into dimensionless
   groupings suitable for inclusion into a mathematical simulation model
   based on a finite difference scheme. It utilises the method of
   characteristics as a solution technique to simulate drainage system
   operation via the equations that define unsteady partially filled or
   full bore pipe flows and the boundary conditions represented by water
   traps and other common system components. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{The ozonation of wastewater containing azo dye in a semi-batch reactor
   has been studied. Results revealed that the rate of ozone transfer
   increased with increases in the initial dye concentration, the applied
   ozone dose and temperature. A model was developed to predict the
   enhancement factor of ozone mass transfer. This model enables the
   prediction of mass transfer coefficient of ozone from the following
   parameters: initial dye concentration, applied ozone dose, temperature
   and concentration of dissolved ozone in the organic-free water. This
   model was also valid for reactors of larger sizes. Result of kinetic
   studies showed that ozonation of the azo dye was a pseudo-first-order
   reaction with respect to dye. The apparent rate constant increased with
   the applied ozone dose and temperature. However, the apparent rate
   constant declined logarithmically with increasing initial dye
   concentration. In addition, ozonation reduced chemical oxygen demand and
   enhanced the biodegradability of the wastewater. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effect of phosphate addition in drinking water was tested under

   to 2 mgP-PO4 L-1 did not show any relationship between bacterial growth
   and phosphate concentration. Dynamic tests in slightly corroded reactor
   (stainless steel) treated at 1 mg P-PO4L-1 showed only a moderate
   improvement in the growth of microorganisms. On the contrary, phosphate
   treatment applied to the highly corroded reactor (unlined cast iron) led
   to an immediate, drastic drop in iron oxide release and bacterial
   production. Phosphate uptake by the reactor wall was less than 14\% with
   the stainless-steel reactor and 70-90\% with the corroded cast iron
   reactor. Moreover, about 5\% of the phosphate associated to corroded
   iron pipe wens was released for 20 days after the end of treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Assimilable organic carbon (AOC) in natural organic matter (NOM) has
   been measured in three Norwegian waters. The AOC measurement has been
   done on unfiltered and membrane-filtered (molecular weight (MW) cut-off
   of 1000 and 10,000) samples. While the colour in the waters is mainly
   related to the NOM with MW > 10,000, the AOC was mainly related to the
   NOM with MW < 1000. The fraction of the NOM with MW < 1000 corresponds
   to 16-38\% of the total organic carbon (TOC), and 4-9\% of the colour.
   This shows that a water treatment process removing the colour and a
   large part of the TOC in the water will not necessarily result in a
   reduction in the biofilm formation potential. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A granular activated carbon (GAC) anaerobic fluidised-bed reactor
   treating vinasse from an ethanol distillery of sugar beet molasses was
   operated for 90 days, the first 40 days of start-up followed by 50 days
   of operation at constant organic loading rate of 1.7g COD/Ld. The
   reactor showed good performance in terms of organic matter removal but
   an anomalous behaviour in terms of unusual high concentrations of
   molecular nitrogen in the biogas. The analysis of the different
   nitrogenous and sulphur compounds and the mass balances of these
   compounds in the liquid and gas phases clearly indicated an uncommon
   evolution of nitrogen and sulphur in the reactor. About 50\% of the
   nitrogen entering the reactor as total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) was
   removed from the liquid phase appearing as N-2 in the gas phase.
   Simultaneously, only 20\% of the S-SO42- initially present in the
   influent appears as S-S2- in the effluent or S-I-IS in the biogas,
   indicating that 80\% of the sulphur is removed. This behaviour has not
   been reported previously in the literature. These observations may
   suggest a new anaerobic removal process of ammonia and sulphate
   according to an uncommon mechanism involving simultaneous anaerobic
   ammonium oxidation and sulphate reduction. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The influence of sludge retention time (SRT) on the extracellular
   polymeric substances (EPS) and physicochemical properties
   (hydrophobicity and surface charge) of sludge was studied using
   laboratory-scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) fed a synthetic
   wastewater containing glucose and inorganic salts. Sludge surfaces were
   more hydrophobic (larger contact angle) and less negatively charged at
   higher SRTs (16 and 20 d) than at lower SRTs (4 and 9 d). The ratio of
   proteins to carbohydrates within the EPS of the sludges increased as the
   SRT increased from 4 to 12 d corresponding to the changes in the
   physicochemical properties of the sludge. The protein: carbohydrate
   ratio remained constant at SRTs of 16 and 20 d. A transition in sludge
   properties appeared to occur between the upper range of low- (9 d) and
   lower range of high- SRTs. The total EPS content, however, was
   independent of the SRT. A higher sludge volume index (SVI), an
   indication of poorer settleability or compression, was associated with a
   larger amount of total EPS but no significant correlation between SVI
   and the surface properties of sludge was observed. A more hydrophobic
   and less negatively charged surface corresponded to lower levels of ESS.
   These results indicate that it is the surface properties,
   hydrophobicity, surface charge and composition of EPS , of sludge,
   rather than the quantity of EPS, that govern biodocculation. In
   contrast, the EPS content is more important in controlling the
   settleability of sludge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The concept of immobilization technology has been incorporated in this
   research study for biomethanation of high strength herbal based
   pharmaceutical wastewater. Accordingly, an investigation has been made
   on laboratory scale to assess the feasibility of an anaerobic fixed film
   fixed bed reactor system to pre-treat herbal-based pharmaceutical
   wastewater with recourse to energy recovery, including influence of
   operating conditions. The work was carried out with laboratory-scale
   upflow reactor, equipped with nylon scrubber as random support. The
   reactor was operated at 35 degreesC. COD removal efficiencies ranging
   from 76 to 98\% were achieved for organic loading rates upto 10
   kgCOD/m(3) d, while the highest organic loading rate (around 48 kg
   COD/m(3) d) led to efficiencies of 46-50\%. The influences of hydraulic
   retention time and substrate concentration were also studied. The
   reactors did now show destabilization under impulse hydraulic and
   organic overloadings. Reactor stability was easily achieved under
   intermittent operation, with breaks, after which the reactors rapidly
   returned to their optimal performance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   method measures iron(II) in the presence of excess iron(III) with less
   than 1\% interference. When used with pre-acidified samples, the total

   spectrometry for a variety of natural waters with a range of dissolved
   organic carbon (3-36mg C/L) and iron (1-28 <mu>M) concentrations. When

Abstract = {{This paper describes the interactions of Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cr(VI)
   competing for ion-exchange sites in naturally occurring clinoptilolite.
   Dissolved Pb and Cd were effectively removed within Ish in batch
   reactors, with higher removal efficiencies (> 95\%) in the acidic pH
   range. The presence of Cr(VI); which can interact with these metals to
   form anionic complexes, significantly diminished the Pb and Cd removal
   efficiencies. A decrease in the efficiency of clinoptilolite to remove
   Pb was also observed in the high (greater than or equal to 10) pH range.
   This was attributed to the formation of anionic hydroxo-complexes with
   little affinity for cationic ion exchange sites. Pb outcompeted Cd for
   ion exchange sites in a flow-through column packed with clinoptilolite
   (contact time = 10 s). The preferential removal of Pb in column, but not
   in batch reactors, reflects that competitive retention can be affected
   by contact time because diffusion kinetics may influence the removal
   efficiency to a greater extent than equilibrium partitioning. Phenol,
   which was tested as a representative organic co-contaminant, slightly
   hindered heavy metal removal in batch reactors. This was attributed to
   the formation of organometallic complexes that cannot penetrate the
   zeolite exchange channels. Altogether, these results show that natural
   zeolites hold great potential to remove cationic heavy metal species
   from industrial wastewater. Nevertheless, process efficiency can be
   hindered by the presence of ligands that form complexes with reduced
   accessibility and/or affinity for ion exchange. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Estuarine waters receive fecal pollution from a variety of sources,
   including humans and wildlife. Escherichia coli is one of several fecal
   coliform bacteria that inhabit the intestines of many warm-blooded

   differentiate contamination sources to accurately assess health risks.
   E. coli were isolated from human sources (HS) and nonhuman sources (NHS)
   in the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve and analyzed for
   fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), O-serogroup, and pulsed-field gel
   electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles. For FAME and PFGE analyses, there was
   no relationship between profile and isolate source. Human source PFGE
   profiles were less diverse than NHS isolates, and conversely for FAME.
   In contrast, O-serogrouping showed less diversity for HS vs. NHS
   isolates, and the predominant HS O-serogroups differed significantly
   (P<0.01) from those of NHS isolates. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Fenton's reagent has been shown to be a feasible technique to treat
   phenolic-type compounds present in a variety of food processing industry
   wastewaters. A model compound, p-hydroxybenzoic acid was oxidised by
   continuously pumping two solutions of ferrous iron and hydrogen
   peroxide. Typical operating variables like reagent feeding
   concentrations and flowrate, temperature and pH were studied.
   A mechanism of reactions based on the classical Fenton's chemistry was
   assumed, and computed concentration profiles of the parent compound,
   ferrous ion and dihydroxybenzene were compared to experimental results.
   The model qualitatively predicted the influence of several operating
   variables, however, calculated results suggested the presence of
   parallel routes of substrate elimination and/or a initiating rate
   constant with a higher value. The low efficiency of a well-known
   hydroxyl radical scavenger (tert-butyl alcohol) also supports the
   contribution of oxidising species different from the hydroxyl radical to
   substrate removal.
   Further evidence of the presence of reactions different from the
   hydroxyl radical oxidation was observed from comparison of the
   simultaneous Fenton's or UV/H2O2 oxidations of p-hydroxybenzoic acid,
   tyrosol and p-coumaric acid. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A novel vertical bed process for the removal of ammonium from secondary
   effluents, using a ``passive air pump{''}, has been developed. The
   process is based on convective aeration caused by a fill and draw
   operational sequence, and combines the advantages of the vertical
   wetlands concept with the high loading rates typically associated with
   trickling filters. Experiments were carried out in a 500-l reactor using
   simulative effluents and actual municipal secondary effluents. A maximal
   ammonium removal rate of 1100 g N/m(2) reactor/d was achieved using
   simulative effluents and an effective gravel size of 0.96 mm. At all
   hydraulic loads applied, the nitrification rate was found to be limited
   by the oxygen transfer rate. The small-size medium used with simulative
   effluents clogged when using actual municipal secondary effluents. Two
   other media (2.46mm and 4.31mm) did not clog during the entire
   experimental period and a maximum removal load of 300 g N/m(2) reactor/d
   was achieved. This value is still much higher than typical rates
   reported for conventional vertical beds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Abstract = {{It is known that M. oleifera contains a natural coagulant in the seeds.
   In our previous research, the method using salt water to extract the
   active coagulation component from M. oleifera seeds was developed and
   compared with the conventional method using water. In this research, the
   active coagulation component was purified from a NaCl solution crude
   extract of Moringa oleifera seeds. The active component was isolated and
   purified from the crude extract through a sequence of steps that
   included salting-out by dialysis, removal of lipids and carbohydrates by
   homogenization with acetone, and anion exchange. Specific coagulation
   activity of the active material increased up to 34 times more than the
   crude extract after the ion exchange. The active component was not the
   same as that of water extract. The molecular weight was about 3000 Da.
   The Lowry method and the phenol-sulfuric acid method indicated that the
   active component was neither protein nor polysaccharide. The optimum pH
   of the purified active component for coagulation of turbidity was pH 8
   and above. Different from the conventional water extracts, the active
   component can be used for waters with low turbidity without increase in
   the dissolved organic carbon concentration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A lab-scale hybrid upflow sludge bed-filter (USBF) reactor was employed
   to carry out methanogenesis and denitrification of the effluent from an
   anaerobic industrial reactor (EAIR) in a fish canning industry. The
   reactor was initially inoculated with methanogenic sludge and there were
   two different operational steps. During the first step (Step I: days
   1-61), the methanogenic process was carried out at organic loading rates
   (OLR) of 1.0-1.25g COD l (- 1) d (- 1) reaching COD removal percentages
   of 80\%. During the second step (Step II: days 62-109) nitrate was added
   as KNO3 to the industrial effluent and the OLR was Varied between 1.0
   and 1.25 g COD l (- 1) d (- 1). Two different nitrogen loads of 0.10 and
   0.22 g NO3--N l (- 1) d (- 1) were applied and these led to nitrogen
   removal percentages of around 100\% in both cases and COD removal
   percentages of around 80\%. Carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) in the
   influent was maintained at 2.0 and eventually it was increased to 3.0,
   by means of glucose addition, to control the denitrification process.
   From these results it is possible to establish that wastewater produced
   in a fish canning industry can be used as a carbon source for
   denitrification and that denitrifying microorganisms were present in the
   initially methanogenic sludge. Biomass productions of 0.23 and 0.61 g
   VSS: g TOC fed for Steps I and II, respectively, were calculated from
   carbon global balances, showing an increase in biomass growth due to
   denitrification. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, rapid technological advances in the textile and dyeing
   industry have yielded benefits to society but have also generated new
   and significant environmental problems. The treatment alternatives
   applicable for the removal of colour vary, depending upon the type of
   dye wastewater. A synthetic, simulated mixed dye waste (Basic Yellow 28,
   Basic Yellow 21, Basic Red 18.1, Basic Violet Red 16, Basic Red 46,
   Basic Blue 16, Basic Blue 41) representing a known waste from a fibre
   production factory, was investigated. The biological process of
   anaerobic digestion has been recognised as a simple and energy-efficient
   means of treating and stabilising a wide range of organic industrial
   wastewaters. This study sets out to demonstrate the effect of different
   loading rates, dye concentrations and hydraulic retention times (HRTs)
   on colour removal efficiency under mesophilic anaerobic conditions. The
   reactor was operated under mesophilic conditions at different organic
   loading rates (OLRs) and HRTs for nine months. The results of this study
   show that a 2-stage mesophilic anaerobic up-flow packed bed reactor can
   remove up to 90\% of the colour from a mixed cationic dye containing
   1000 mg/l of dye. Colour removal efficiency falls as the influent dye
   concentration increases, but rises with increased hydraulic retention
   time and increased organic loading. The primary colour removal mechanism
   was one of biosorption with subsequent biodegradation. Acetoclastic
   methanogens were moderately inhibited at low organic loading rates of
   0.25 kg COD/m(3)d, at which level, acidogenesis and acetogenesis
   appeared to be unaffected. Inhibition of acidogenesis became marked at
   higher OLRs (1 kg COD/m(3) d) and when the HRT was reduced from 5 to 3
   days. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Restricted requirements for nitrogen reduction at wastewater treatment
   plants have increased the need for assays determining the inhibition of
   nitrification. In this paper, two new essays studying ammonia oxidation
   and nitrite oxidation, respectively, are presented. As test organisms,
   pure cultures of Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter isolated from activated
   sludge are used. The assays are performed in test tubes where the
   bacteria are incubated with the compound or wastewater to be tested. The
   nitrification rate is measured during 4h and compared with reference
   samples. The test organisms were characterised with respect to
   temperature, pH and cell activity. Optimum temperature was 35 degreesC
   for Nitrosomonas and 38 degreesC for Nitrobacter; optimum pH was 8.1 for
   Nitrosomonas and 7.9 for Nitrobacter. There was a linear relationship
   between the nitrification rate and the cell concentration in the studied
   interval. The cell activity decreased slightly with storage time. A
   significant level of inhibition was calculated to 11\% for the
   Nitrosomonas assay, and to 9\% for the Nitrobacter assay. The assays are
   applicable to determination of nitrification inhibition in samples of
   industrial waste waters or influents of treatment plants, or chemical
   substances likely to be found in wastewater. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{There is a growing acknowledgement of the need to recognise
   uncertainties in the estimation of waterborne risks. In this paper, the
   strength of the science available to characterise Cryptosporidium risks

   recently developed scientific quality audit framework is used as a tool
   to guide this investigation. The framework systematically reveals the
   relatively greater strength of the science for the ``upstream{''}
   elements (estimation of concentrations in environmental reservoirs) than
   for the ``downstream{''} elements (concentrations in distribution). It
   is the downstream elements that have greater bearing on human health and
   public policy issues. It is noted that the adoption of new monitoring
   Regulations is likely to prompt action to strengthen knowledge of these
   downstream elements in the future. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The concentrations of detergent phosphates in raw sewage entering a

   low and high phosphorus loads. The calculated loads of detergent
   phosphorus entering the plant on low and high load days were 260 gP/day
   and 350 gP/day, respectively. The half-life of detergent phosphates
   (triphosphate) in waste waters was measured to be 7.3 hours at 15
   degreesC and 3.0 h at 20 degreesC. The major factor contributing to

Abstract = {{Based on the age distributions of powdered activated carbon (PAC) in
   reactors, the competitive bi-solute isotherm and the pore-surface
   diffusion mechanism, a model was developed to predict the removal of a
   trace synthetic organic chemical (SOC) when PAC was applied to an
   ultrafiltration (UF) membrane system. Independent experiments evaluated
   the input parameters for the model. The pore diffusion in liquid-filled
   pore was the dominant internal mass transfer mechanism in a PAC particle
   and the surface diffusion mechanism was neglected in the model. Model
   prediction was compared with data from pilot plant experiments treating
   simazine in natural water. Due to the blending and the increasing PAC in
   the UF loop, a transient behavior of effluent simazine concentration was
   observed in the UF effluent. The model predicted successfully this
   periodical Variation of the simazine concentration in the UF loop
   effluent, as well as the simazine concentration in the effluent from the
   PAC slurry contactor. The faithful model prediction required the
   modeling of the phenomenon of adsorption/desorption of an SOC on

Abstract = {{This paper describes several application potentials with a recently
   developed model for predicting the synthetic organic chemical (SOC)
   removal by powdered activated carbon (PAC) adsorption during
   ultrafiltration (UF) and discusses the removal mechanism. The model was
   successfully applied, without any modification, to dead-end mode
   operation as well as to cross-Row mode operation, validating the
   assumption of the internal diffusion control mechanism and the
   continuously-stirred-tank-reactor (CSTR) concept. Even when UF was
   operated in a cross-how mode, PAC added was re-circulating in suspension
   for only a short time. Then, solute uptake look place mostly by PAC
   immobilized in membrane tubes not only for dead-end operation but also
   for cross-flow operation. Therefore, cross-flow operation did not have
   any advantage regarding the SOC mass transfer on PAC in UF loop over
   dead-end operation. The model simulation implied that pulse PAC addition
   at the beginning of filtration cycle resulted better SOC removal than
   continuous PAC addition. However, for the pulse PAC addition mode, the
   model predicted somewhat lower effluent SOC concentration than the
   observed values, and the benefit of pulse PAC application in terms of
   reducing SOC over its continuous dosage was not confirmed. Longer
   detention time of PAC dosed in a pulse than continuously dosed PAC could
   possibly further decrease internal diffusivity. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A two-phase anaerobic reactor system with a submerged membrane in the
   acidogenic reactor was designed for the enhancement of organic acid
   conversion and methane recovery. A submerged membrane system in a
   two-phase anaerobic reactor was tested to increase the sludge retention
   time (SRT) of acidogen and to enhance the solid separation. The pilot
   plant experiment was performed for piggery wastewater treatment for a
   year. The membrane material used was mixed esters of cellulose of 0.5
   mum pore size. COD removal efficiency was 80\% and the methane
   production showed 0.32 m(3)/kg COD removed for the submerged membrane
   system in the anaerobic digester. As the cake resistance of the membrane
   caused a serious problem, a stainless-steel prefilter and air
   backwashing methods were applied to minimize the cake resistance
   effectively. Among the tested prefilters, the 63 mum pore prefilter
   showed the best performance for reducing cake resistance and a
   successful long-term operation. By cleaning with alkali first and acidic
   solutions later, the permeate flux decreased by long-term operation was
   recovered to 89\% of that with a new membrane. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science
