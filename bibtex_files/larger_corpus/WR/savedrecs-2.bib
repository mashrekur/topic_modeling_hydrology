Abstract = {{The effect of the additive, polyethylene glycol (PEG), on the
   horseradish peroxidase (HRP) catalysed removal of phenol from wastewater
   has been studied over the phenol concentration range of 1-10 mM (0.1-1.0
   g/l). The optimum pH, HRP concentration, PEG concentration and the molar
   ratio of hydrogen peroxide and phenol have been investigated in the
   presence of PEG at room temperature in order to achieve the maximum
   phenol removal efficiency with the minimum cost. The effect of
   concentrations of HRP and PEG on reaction time was also investigated.
   Experimental results showed that the addition of PEG had significant
   protective effect on the activity of HRP. The amount of peroxidase
   required was reduced 40- and 75-fold less than that required without PEG
   for 1 and 10 mM phenol solutions, respectively. The higher the phenol
   concentration, the more effective was the addition of PEG. In the
   presence of PEG, the optimum pH is 8.0 and the optimum molar ratio of
   hydrogen peroxide and phenol is around 1.0. The minimum doses of HRP and
   PEG required for at least 95\% removal were determined for several
   phenol concentrations and two empirical models are proposed to predict
   the minimum HRP and PEG doses required for 95\% removal over the entire
   phenol concentration range of 1-10 mM. Under the optimum reaction
   conditions described above, the reaction times for at least 95\% removal
   from 1 and 10 mM phenol solutions were 5 and 3h, respectively. An
   increase in HRP concentration significantly reduced the reaction time;
   however, an increase in PEG concentration showed negligible influence.}},

Abstract = {{Physical and chemical characteristics of activated sludge such as floc
   size, density, specific surface, carbohydrate content, dehydrogenase
   activity and settleability were investigated by seven parallel bench
   scale activated sludge units operated under different sludge ages
   (1.1-17.4 days). The analytical methods used included a dye adsorption
   technique for specific surface area determinations, the Coulter Counter
   method for floc size measurements and interference microscopy for floc
   density determinations. The typical floc sizes were found to be in the
   range 10-70 mum with floc densities in the range 1.015-1.034 g cm-3. A
   strong correlation between floc density and size was obtained. The
   specific surface areas measured (typically 100-200 m2 g-1 dry sludge)
   were found to be one to two orders of magnitude higher than the
   corresponding geometric floc surface areas, indicating a porous floc
   structure. Sludge settleability, for non-filamentous sludges, was well
   correlated to both floc size, density and specific surface area, but not
   to the sludge carbohydrate content, which was found to vary between 6
   and 18\%.}},

Abstract = {{A model that accounts for transport in the axial direction by convection
   and in the radial direction by diffusion and that incorporates first
   order decay kinetics has been developed to predict the chlorine
   concentration in a pipe in a distribution system. A generalized
   expression for chlorine consumption at the pipe wall is used to solve
   the governing equation and to determine the average chlorine
   concentration at any location in the pipe. Three non-dimensional
   parameters are used to determine the concentration and a methodology to
   determine them in pipe networks is proposed. The range of values of
   these dimensionless parameters where wall consumption is significant are
   determined. The methodology is applied to field measurements of chlorine
   concentration in a distribution network.}},

Abstract = {{Trihalomethanes (THMs) form when chlorine reacts with certain
   naturally-occurring organic molecules (THM precursors) during the
   disinfection of drinking water. THMs are believed to have significant

   sources is important because source management may lower costs and
   increase effectiveness of in-plant treatments. This study investigated
   the importance of lake and reservoir sediments as a THM precursor
   source.
   Sediments collected from littoral and profundal areas of Lake Rockwell
   Reservoir (Portage County, Ohio) and from a nearby natural take (East
   Twin Lake) were kept in the dark for 21 days at 20-degrees-C to estimate
   release rates of THM precursors. All sediments had significant THM
   precursor releases relative to non-sediment controls. Anaerobic
   conditions produced significantly less precursors than during an aerobic
   incubation. Littoral sediment precursor release rate (mug THMs/m2/day)
   was significantly greater than precursor release rates for lake and
   reservoir profundal sediments. The importance of sediment THM precursor
   release relative to other sources is discussed.}},

   herbicide 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid after treatment by
   photoassisted Fe3+-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide oxidation, which is being
   investigated for waste treatment. Toluene-extraction of aqueous reagent
   grade 2,4,5-T gave 30 quantifiable PCDD/F isomer peaks, some of which
   represented more than one congener. They included 13 tetra- through
   heptachloro PCDDs totalling 18.4 ng/g, and 17 tetra- through octachloro
   PCDFs totalling 12.9 ng/g. Treatment with Fe3+/H2O2/hv (mole ratio
   2,4,5-T: Fe3+: H2O2 = 1: 10: 200; visible fluorescent light, 300 nm
   cutoff) in aerated solution at pH 2.8 resulted in 89-100\% removal of
   all PCDD/F peaks except that for OCDF, which was 66\% removed. The
   2,4,5-T was shown previously to be completely mineralised to HCl and
   CO2. Direct photolysis of the PCDD/Fs was negligible. The
   2,3,7,8-tetra-CDD referenced `'toxic equivalent'' used in risk
   assessment was reduced by 99.9\% (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   `method) or 99.6\% (international method). Reaction mixtures
   supplemented with 2,3,7,8-(UL-C-14)-tetra-CDD and
   2,3,4,7,8-(dichlorophenyl-C-14)-penta-CDF evolved up to 45 and 64\%,
   respectively, theoretical yield of (CO2)-C-14. Most of the remaining
   C-14 was converted to hydrophilic forms not extractable by toluene. Dark
   (Fe3+/H2O2) treatment was somewhat less effective overall.}},

Abstract = {{The microbiological quality of various fresh waters in the Araraquara
   region, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil was investigated. Ninety-nine water
   samples were taken from rivers, reservoirs, artesian and non-artesian
   wells, springs and tap waters, and these waters were analysed using:
   plate counts of heterotrophic microorganisms (per 1 ml); Most Probable
   Number (MPN) of fecal coliforms and E. coli (per 100 ml); tests for
   presence of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, the E. coli pathogens of
   classes EPEC, ETEC and EIEC and Mycobacterium, Shigella, Yersinia and
   enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) were not isolated. The other types of
   microorganisms were isolated in varying proportions. We conclude that
   the waters investigated represent a potential microbiological health
   risk.}},

   investigate the efficiency of this process in reducing the color and

   coagulation, the chemical oxygen demand of those waste effluents can be
   consistently reduced by up to 70\% or more. Ozonation is capable of
   decomposing the highly structured dye molecules into smaller ones which
   can be easily biodegraded in an activated sludge process. Hence
   combination of ozonation, chemical coagulation and the activated sludge
   processes can provide a very effective means for dealing with this

Abstract = {{The interaction between denitrification and methanogenesis, with
   methanol functioning as an electron donor, has been examined through
   usage of a mixed culture system of denitrifying sludge and methanogenic
   sludge in an anaerobic bioreactor. Competition for methanol between
   these two kinds of biocommunity could not be observed, whereas
   methanogenesis was suppressed as long as nitrate and nitrite were made
   available in the mixed system. The inhibition of methanogenesis in the
   methanogenic sludge caused by nitrogen oxides was studied. The redox
   potential (E(h)) of the culture was monitored and/or controlled for the
   sake of characterizing the behavior of the biocommunities. An addition
   of nitrite elevated the E(h) of the culture less than nitrate did.
   Nitrite addition, however, exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on
   methanogenesis as compared to nitrate at the same concentration. The
   influence of redox potential on the methanation of methanol was examined
   by using a methanogenic sludge in the E(h)-stat batch culture. The
   hypothesis that the inhibitory effect being expressed by the nitrogen
   oxides is not simply attributed to an elevation of the redox potential
   of the culture is supported by the experimental results. The toxic
   effect of the nitrogen oxides themselves could also have possibly
   contributed significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater from integrated petroleum refineries normally contains 20-80
   mg/l ammonia-nitrogen which is harmful to the fishes in the receiving

   methods of nitrifying bacteria were tried.
   Results indicated that by supplementing glucose nutrient, over 90\%
   ammonia-nitrogen in the refinery wastewater could be converted into
   nitrite within 7-14 days in either an activated sludge or rotating
   biological contactor system. Trace nitrate was detected. Further
   addition of yeast powder to the treatment systems stimulated the growth
   of Nitrobacter which accelerated the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate.
   Complete oxidation of the influent ammonia-nitrogen was observed 7 days
   later after adding 5 mg/l yeast powder to the influent wastewater. It
   also showed that neither glucose nor yeast powder were required for
   sustaining ammonia nitrification after the augmentation of Nitrobacter
   was achieved.}},

   The possible events (nutrients, N/P ratio, particular climatic
   conditions) that cause the formation of the mucilage masses were
   examined and are discussed here. Furthermore, the oxygenation state of
   the water on the surface and on the bottom as well as the possible
   effects on molluscs were also examined. The field results indicated that
   no anoxia phenomena were found in bottom waters caused by mucilages, and
   that mollusc death was probably due to mechanical reasons. Finally the
   places where the mucilages formed and their subsequent movements are
   described.}},

Abstract = {{The present work examines the possible use of fly ash, a by-product of
   coal power stations, as a means of removing arsenic (V) from water, or
   equivalently, of restricting its movement in the solid wastes or the
   soil. Kinetic and equilibrium experiments were performed in order to
   evaluate the removal efficiency of lignite-based fly ash. Both
   adsorption and desorption experiments were done at three pH levels,
   namely 4,7 and 10. The results indicated that arsenic can be removed
   from water by fly ash, yet the degree of removal depended markedly on
   the pH. Removal at pH 4, as demonstrated by the adsorption isotherms,
   was significantly higher than that at the other two pH values. For 80\%
   removal of arsenic, the solid phase concentration at pH 4 was up to 4
   times greater than that at the other two pH levels. During the
   desorption studies only a small amount of the pre-adsorbed arsenic was
   released into the water. This amount was practically independent of the
   initial fly ash loading. This indicates that adsorption of arsenic on
   fly ash is almost irreversible and, therefore, there are good prospects
   for arsenic fixation on fly ash in practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Primary productivity and production measurements and their relationship
   to observed variations in the concentrations of nutrients (N and P),
   CO2, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and solar radiation were studied
   in an 8 m deep sewage stabilization pond from October 1986 to December
   1987. Two types of tests were carried out: short-term and long-term. The
   latter permitted the transformation of short-term measurements into
   daily measurements and the obtention of the relationship between the
   time of day and primary production. The measurement of primary
   production was performed using the C-14 technique.
   The highest primary productivity values were detected during the
   spring-summer period, which was characterized by high temperatures and
   an increased degree of solar radiation. The maximum value was obtained
   during June (14.38 mg C mg Chl-1 day-1) and was accompanied by: (a) a
   decrease in the concentration of nutrients (N and P) and CO2, (b) an
   increase in pH levels and dissolved oxygen concentrations and (c) a
   significant proliferation of cyanobacteria (which indicated a low
   organic loading).}},

Abstract = {{N2O concentrations in the groundwaters collected in the Kanto District
   and Nagano Prefecture in Japan and five counties in New York State were
   determined. These N2O data were obtained from the water samples from
   wells, springs and seepages from soils in forests and cropping fields.
   The N2O concentrations in all samples greatly exceeded those of
   atmospheric equilibration. The average concentration of 690 nM N2O is
   one order of magnitude larger than that in deep ocean. All groundwaters
   of the present study were aerobic with a high level of NO3-, but with
   the absence of NO2- and NH4+, and with a very low level of dissolved
   organic carbon. These characteristics suggest that the nitrate
   respiration in the aquifers is of little significance for the production
   of N2O.
   DELTAN2O/NO3- molar ratios in the groundwaters were between 10(-4) and
   10(-2) (DELTA indicates the excess gas over that which would be in
   equilibrium). This supports the above view since the observed N2O yield
   agrees with that reported for the production during an ammonia
   oxidation. If nitrification was indeed a major mechanism for the
   production of groundwater N2O, subsequent release of N2O from the
   aquifers that are polluted with nitrogen may deserve more close
   attention as a potential source of atmospheric N2O via diffusion and
   discharge.}},

Abstract = {{To measure the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)) and the half

   used, where differing volumes of concentrated wastewater were contacted
   with biomass in a respirometer and the response measured as a change in
   oxygen uptake rate (DELTAOUR). The DELTAOUR was then related to the
   growth rate, and a series of substrate concentration/growth rate
   relationships determined from which mu(max) and K(s) were calculated. A
   freeze concentration technique was developed to concentrate the
   wastewater. The concentration technique did not alter the response of
   the microorganisms to the wastewater. Maximum specific growth rates
   (mu(max)) and half saturation coefficients (K(s)) were found to vary
   between 1.3 and 1.9 d-1 and 1.5 and 3.2 mg l-1, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure is given for the minimal treatment of wastewater in a 1-day

   faecal coliforms in the fishpond is then determined; this should be not
   greater than 1000 per 100 ml to ensure that the fish are
   microbiologically safe for human consumption. Fish (carp and tilapia)
   yields are of the order of 13 t ha-1 a-1, assuming that the pond is

Abstract = {{Sediment sample extracts initially analyzed by gas chromatography/mass

   were re-evaluated using a broad spectrum approach. Mass spectra for most

   organic compounds were organized into a spreadsheet database.
   The non-regulated organic compounds in the database were prioritized and
   fifteeen of the most frequently occurring compounds or compound groups
   were chosen for further study and potential identification. Four
   compounds, calamenene, dehydroabietine, retene and
   benzo(b)naphtho(2,1-d)thiophene were positively identified.
   Tetrahydroretene was tentatively identified while three compounds remain
   unidentified. Seven compound groups, including alkylbenzenes,
   alkylphenols and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contained many

Abstract = {{Low (ca 0.01 ppb) concentrations of the naturally occurring terpene
   derivatives geosmin (1alpha,10beta-dimethyl-9alpha-decalol) and
   2-methylisoborneol
   {[}(1-R-exo)-1,2,7,7-tetramethyl-bicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptan-2-ol] (MIB),
   impart earthy/muddy `'off-flavors'' to many water and food resources.
   The presence of these `'off-flavors'' often elicits public concern over
   the safety of the affected resources. The `'Ames test'', assesses the
   induction of reverse mutation at the histidine locus in specially
   constructed Salmonella typhimurium tester strains, and is a widely used
   index of mutagenicity. This investigation indicated that neither MIB nor
   geosmin, when tested up to cytotoxic levels in both the presence and
   absence of exogenous metabolic activation, induced a mutagenic response
   in either strain TA98 or TA100 compared to controls. Doses of MIB and
   geosmin above 45.2 and 18.1 ppm, respectively, inhibited tester strain
   growth, indicating that high concentrations of these metabolites may
   exhibit an antimicrobial activity, possibly by a mechanism similar to
   that reported for certain other terpene derived alcohols. Food or water
   resources containing similar concentrations of geosmin or MIB would be
   extremely unpalatable and would probably not be consumed.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic model was developed for sequencing batch anaerobic reactors
   (SBARs) to describe substrate degradation under non-steady-state
   conditions. Assuming unionized volatile fatty acids were inhibitory,
   simulation results showed that product inhibition of methanogenesis and
   substrate degradation in the SBAR process can be expressed by modified
   Haldane or non-competitive inhibition functions. The proposed modified
   functions also reflect quite accurately the effect of large variations
   in reactor biomass concentration as a result of dilution during the fill
   stage. The determination of kinetic parameters and the verification of
   the model were made with different sets of experimental data. Simulated
   results from the model were in good agreement with experimental data
   under different operating strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Horseradish peroxidase enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of toxic aromatic
   compounds, especially phenols and aromatic amines, in the presence of
   hydrogen peroxide. The reaction products polymerize to form high
   molecular weight materials which readily precipitate from solution;
   hence, providing a means for the treatment of wastewaters which contain
   aromatic compounds. The catalytic lifetime of horseradish peroxidase
   enzyme can be extended by optimizing treatment conditions such as pH and
   temperature and by maintaining a low instantaneous enzyme concentration
   in the reaction mixture. The enzyme catalyzed polymerization process was
   implemented in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) configuration
   because reactant and enzyme concentrations are lowered immediately upon
   entering the reactor causing a reduction in inactivation of HRP through
   free radical bonding and compound III formation. Catalytic turnovers
   achieved in single and multiple CSTRs in series were significantly
   higher than those observed in batch reactors when sufficient retention
   time was provided.}},

Abstract = {{The bioleaching of heavy metals from sewage sludges can be accomplished
   by indigenous sulfur-oxidizing bacteria present in the sludge. The
   performance of the bioleaching process is influenced by various
   parameters such as sludge solids concentration, pH, acid concentration
   etc. Effects of such parameters on system performance were
   experimentally evaluated. It was found that the sludge suspended solids
   concentration plays a major role in regulating the acid production
   indirectly, by influencing the nature of the pH drop in the system; the
   sludge solids concentration does not directly affect the metal
   solubilization process. An initial sludge pH of 4.0 produced the maximum
   sulfate production rate, but the initial sludge pH had little effect on
   the final metal solubilization levels achieved. Growth rates of the two
   bacterial species present in the system were found to have a linear
   relationship with the natural logarithm of the system pH. To take this
   dependence into account, a new system parameter called the buffering
   capacity index of the sludge was defined. BCI was found to bear a linear
   relationship with sludge solids concentration, for a given type of
   sludge (non-digested, aerobically digested or anaerobically digested).}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model of the overall process of metal bioleaching from
   sewage sludge has been developed on the basis of experimental
   observations. Sludge pH was identified as the parameter which controls
   bacterial growth and thus the overall process. Quantitative
   relationships among the various process parameters were incorporated in
   the conceptual model, giving a mathematical model for the process.
   Bacterial growth, sulfate concentration and pH profiles simulated using
   the model were found to match experimental observations. The degree of
   solubilization of each metal was found to depend on the sludge pH and
   the type of the sludge and is given as a set of solubilization curves.}},

Abstract = {{Activated carbon prepared from bicarbonate-treated peanut hulls (BPHC)
   has been used for the adsorption of Hg(II) over a range of initial metal
   ion concentrations (10-20 mg dm-3), agitation time (5-180 min),
   adsorbent dosage (5-120 mg 100 ml-1) and pH (1.5-10.0). Adsorption of
   Hg(II) increased with increase in its initial concentration from 10 to
   20 mg dm-3 and the equilibrium time of adsorption increased from 75 to
   90 min for a BPHC dose of 100 mg 100 ml-1. The process of uptake obeys
   both the Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms. The applicability of the
   Lagergren kinetic model has also been investigated. Quantitative removal
   of 20 mg dm-3 Hg(II) in 100 ml by 70 mg adsorbent was observed over a pH
   range of 3.5-10.0. A comparative study with a commercial granular
   activated carbon (CAC) showed that BPHC is 7 times more effective

Abstract = {{Hepatic metallothionein (MT) levels and mixed function oxidase (MFO)
   activity (7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase or EROD) were measured in
   fingerling rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to sublethal
   concentrations of 12 pulp and paper effluents, after completion of 96 h
   static acute lethality assays. Barring one primary-treated effluent
   where MFO levels were significantly depressed and two secondary-treated
   effluents where no significant MFO induction were observed, all other
   effluents triggered significant induction of MT and EROD, regardless of
   mill process/treatment or of effluent lethality and chemical
   characteristics. MT and EROD inductions were significant, however, at
   higher concentrations for secondary-treated effluents than for
   primary-treated ones. Lethal (96 h LC50s) to sublethal (MT and EROD
   lowest observable effect concentrations) ratios were variable and
   indicated that significant biochemical effects were present at effluent
   concentrations that were roughly 4-33 (MT) and 3-59 (EROD) times lower
   than the LC50. Enzyme induction ranged from 1.3 to 2.5-fold for MT and
   from 1.3 to 9.4-fold for EROD compared to controls. Limited chemical
   data available suggest that there were indeed classes of compounds
   present capable of inducing MT or EROD. Observed patterns of MT/MFO
   responses also suggest that contaminant interactions may have interfered
   with induction for some of the effluents studied. Refinements of this
   combined (sub)lethal bioassay procedure are envisaged to determine
   whether it can provide an efficient means of detecting hazardous
   chemicals in industrial wastewaters.}},

   A first-order kinetic model, modified for naturally occurring trace

Abstract = {{Pyrolysis has been used for the last ten years to study the chemical
   nature of humic substances. However, obtaining data is hampered by
   analytical limitations. One of these is that carboxylic acids other than
   fatty acids are not usually present amongst pyrolysis products. To
   overcome this problem, a novel method - pyrolysis/methylation - is
   applied. Simultaneous pyrolysis/derivatization with tetramethylammonium
   hydroxide protects the carboxyl groups by formation of methyl esters. At
   the same time, partial methylation of hydroxyl groups occurs. This
   method permits the identification of a suite of carboxyl-containing
   aromatic and aliphatic compounds, not previously observed in
   conventional pyrolysis, providing useful information on the
   biodegradation processes of plant materials leading to macromolecular
   humic substances.}},

Abstract = {{The sorption to activated sludge biomass of four model chemical
   pollutants, 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol
   (2,4,6-TCP), pentachlorophenol (PCP) and lindane, was studied in
   laboratory experiments. Sorption isotherms were determined for three
   biomass samples: a sludge sample from a municipal waste/water treatment
   plant and two resulting laboratory cultures grown on synthetic peptone
   sewage at solids retention times (SRT) of 2.7 and > 100 days,
   respectively. The sorption experiments were performed in test tubes with
   various concentrations of model compounds added.
   Based on linear sorption coefficients, the removal by sorption was
   calculated for activated sludge reactors operated at various conditions.
   This made it possible to quantify that part of the observed removal of
   the model compounds, which was due to biodegradation, and that part
   which was due to sorption. Removal by sorption was only important for
   PCP and was up to 50\% of the total removal at short SRTs (< 3 days),
   decreasing to 5-10\% at higher SRTs (> 14 days). There are two reasons
   to expect that sorption in bioreactors with low SRTs will play a more
   important role than for bioreactors with high SRTs: (i) at low SRT the
   slow growing specific degraders will be washed out from the reactor
   system. Consequently, biodegradation is stopped and the concentration
   level in the bioreactor increases, which leads to an increased sorption
   and (ii) a higher mass-flow of wasted biomass will contribute to an
   increased removal of pollutants in the sorbed phase.
   The linear sorption coefficients for 2,4-DCP and 2,4,6-TCP were a little
   higher than expected from log K(ow) correlations, for PCP much higher
   than expected and for the non-polar compound lindane within the expected
   range. For the chlorinated phenols, this was probably due to some
   sorption of the ionized phenolate fractions.}},

Abstract = {{The process of neutralization with NaOH, in the presence of Fe(III)
   salt, of sulphuric acid battery industry wastewater seems to be more
   suitable than any other process for Pb removal because at the same time,
   it allows the exploitation of the scavenger action of Fe(III), which is
   often present in the same wastewater and precipitates as hydroxides. In
   order to optimize sludge production, a laboratory research study has
   been carried out to minimize the quantity of Fe(III) to be added. All
   aspects concerning the chemistry of wastewater have been taken into
   consideration step by step and discussed. As a result, a process which
   requires the addition of Fe(III) so that an Fe/Pb ratio, both expressed
   as ppm, of the order of 0.5 is achieved. The process has been applied to
   two artificial solutions, characterized by a content of H2SO4 of 1000
   and 5000 ppm, respectively, and by 10 ppm of Pb, as well as to five
   samples of wastewater. The proposed process takes about 1 h to perform:
   30 min for neutralization up to pH 8.5-9.5 and Fe(III) addition and 30
   min for correction in the 9-9.5 pH range and for flocculation with the
   help of a polyelectrolyte. The Pb concentration of the treated effluent
   is below 0.2 ppm. Conditions for Pb removal using only NaOH or Na2CO3
   have also been considered.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of protocatechuic acid with ozone in aqueous solution has
   been studied varying the temperature, pH, ozone partial pressure and
   initial acid concentration. A stoichiometric ratio of 2 mol of ozone
   consumed per mol of protocatechuic acid reacted is deduced from
   homogeneous experiments in a discontinuous tank reactor.
   In the ozonation experiments, the influence of the operating variables
   was established and the kinetic regime of ozone absorption was shown to
   be fast and pseudo m-order with respect to ozone, except at pH 2, when
   the reaction develops in the moderate kinetic regime. After applying a
   mass transfer with chemical reaction model, the reaction orders are
   deduced and the kinetic rate constants are determined as a function of
   pH and temperature. A modified Arrhenius expression is proposed to
   correlate them.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method developed for the analysis of
   chlorophenols in liquid sewage sludges. After a comparison of different
   extraction procedures, wet sludge extraction with a solvent mixture of
   hexane and isopropyl alcohol was selected. Twelve sewage sludges from
   rural, urban and industrial sewage treatment works in north-west England
   were analysed by capillary GC-ECD, using a derivatization procedure. The
   total chlorophenol content ranged between 9.8 and 60.5 mg/kg (38.7-99.2
   mu g/l), with a mean of 34.6 mg/kg (70.4 mu g/l). The most abundant
   chlorophenol was 2,4-dichlorophenol, which had a mean concentration of
   26 +/- 15.7 mg/kg (51.6 +/- 19.6 mug/l); pentachlorophenol
   concentrations ranged between 0.1 and 2.04 mg/kg (0.21-3.76 mu g/l).
   Chlorophenols with known sources and/or those which are known
   degradation products were found in the greatest abundance. The data are
   discussed in relation to literature reported figures and the inputs of
   chlorophenols to sludge amended agricultural soils is assessed.}},

Abstract = {{A non-consumptive probe was used to measure DO concentrations in mobile
   sand dunes of the Tarawera River, New Zealand, which receives pulp-mill
   effluent. Net oxygen depletion rates were low in the top 5-10 cm
   (occasionally 10-20 cm) of the sediments which indicates that turbulent
   dispersion transports oxygen to these depths. Below 10-20 cm the net
   depletion rate was independent of depth which implies that the oxygen
   resupply rate was negligible. Minimum DO concentrations were invariably
   found at the upstream (scouring) face of the dunes indicating that
   advection through the sediments was negligible. A simple analytical
   model showed that dune turnover explained 30\% of the observed river
   deoxygenation rate. Benthic uptake arising from dune turnover was
   uniform down the river because an increase in dune height along the
   river was offset by a decrease in river DO. This helps explain why the
   river deoxygenation rate is uniform. A fragile layer of fluidized
   sediment covered the crests of each dune. It was inferred that oxygen
   uptake in this layer explained 60\% of the river deoxygenation rate but
   an improved understanding of oxygen dynamics within the fluidized layer
   is required. In other mobile-bed rivers it is likely that dune turnover
   will be important in determining the benthic mass transfer rate.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach for the evaluation of activated carbon adsorption
   capacity in the treatment of wastewater or water contaminated by toxic
   organic compounds is presented. It is based on direct determination of
   the toxicity in the treated water, as opposed to actual chemical
   analysis of its constituents. A toxicity bioassay, based upon
   measurement of bacterial bioluminescence, was utilized for this purpose.
   The suitability of this approach was judged by applying values of
   residual toxicities, obtained during batch adsorption experiments with
   mixtures of pure chemicals and industrial wastes, to traditional
   mathematical models. The Freundlich model equation could be applied
   successfully using toxicity values, to yield toxicity-based isotherms
   and adsorption constants. This approach allows a fast, convenient
   assessment of selective toxicants adsorption, with a simultaneous
   evaluation of the effect of the treated water on biota in receiving
   streams. It may alleviate the need for costly and impractical analytical
   methods, when complex wastes of unknown or variable composition are to
   be tested.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between the loading factor (L(i)) and BOD5, COD, TSS,
   total coliform, fecal coliform and coliphage removals were explored
   using three laboratory SBRs receiving a medium-to-low strength domestic
   sewage. The SBRs were operated with different FILL/REACT ratios in a 6-h
   cycle. Not unexpectedly results showed that increases in L(i) led to
   decreases in the removals of BOD5, COD, TSS and potential pathogen
   indicators. However, low SVIs (Sludge Volume Index) in the SBR need not
   necessarily mean good solids settleability. Good settleability is,
   however, necessary for good TSS removal as it led to better removals of
   total BOD5, total COD and indicators of potential pathogens. During
   FILL, fermentation reactions probably occurred and this resulted in up
   to 86\% reduction of the initial dissolved BOD5 concentration.
   Degradation of waste then continued into the REACT period. This
   preliminary assessment showed that the SBR is, potentially, a viable
   option for domestic wastewater treatment, especially since the aeration
   time required for treatment to achieve comparable effluent quality is
   shorter than the conventional continuous activated sludge systems which
   are usually operated with about 3-8 h of aeration time.}},

Abstract = {{A sediment testing intermittent renewal (STIR) system (stationary or
   portable) for invertebrate toxicity testing with contaminated sediments
   has been successfully developed and thoroughly tested at ERL-Duluth.
   Both the stationary and portable systems enable the maintenance of
   acceptable water quality (e.g. DO) through the capability of
   automatically renewing overlying water in sediment tests at rates
   ranging from 1 to 21 volume renewals/day. The STIR system not only
   significantly reduces the labor associated with renewal of overlying
   water but also affords a gentle exchange of water that results in
   virtually no sediment resuspension. Both systems can also be installed
   in a compact vented enclosure to permit safe testing of hazardous
   contaminated sediments. To date the STIR system has been used
   extensively for conducting 10-day bulk sediment tests with Chironomus
   tentans, Hyalella azteca and Lumbriculus variegatus.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence that a substantial proportion of the
   suspended sediment load transported by many rivers is composed of
   composite rather than primary particles. In consequence, improved
   techniques for determining the in situ or effective particle size
   characteristics of the suspended sediment and the grain size of the
   primary particles making up the composite particles are required in
   order to obtain a better understanding of both the transport and fate of
   such material in fluvial systems and the geochemistry of suspended
   particulate material. This paper describes a field-based water
   elutriation apparatus which has been successfully employed to
   investigate the in situ particle size characteristics of suspended
   sediment transported by the River Exe in Devon, U.K. The reported
   procedure allows suspended sediment to be drawn directly from the river
   channel and hydraulically sorted, without disturbance, into five
   effective size classes. In addition to providing information on the
   effective grain size distribution, the approach also enables the
   absolute grain size composition of each effective size class to be
   determined.}},

Abstract = {{The results of experiments into the kinetics of the treatment of a high
   strength vegetable pickling waste in an experimental RBC are described.
   A high correlation was found between TOC and BOD which justified the use
   of TOC in the investigation. The substrate loading rate removal was
   compared with predictions from the Stover-Kincannon model. The
   Stover-Kincannon relationship was found to satisfactorily predict the
   TOC loading removal rate and to be particularly useful in predicting the
   load removal rate at high applied loading rates. A linear regression
   analysis was used to determine the relationship between the output TOC
   in terms of the input TOC and the hydraulic loading rate. This enabled
   the prediction of an apparent half-order of reaction to be confirmed.
   Special features of this work are the use of TOC as the major analytical
   parameter and the very high input concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of methylmercury species in aqueous solutions as well
   as their gas/liquid partitioning, has been studied as a function of pH
   and halide concentrations using Head Space analysis with Gas
   Chromatography-Microwave Induced Plasma detection. The methylmercury
   concentration in the vapour phase, being directly related to its
   concentration in the liquid phase, gives, as a result of differences in
   volatility, information on the nature of the methylmercury species in
   solution. In methylmercury solutions at high pH, MeHgX (X denotes Cl,
   Br, I) is transformed into MeHgOH: for MeHgCl, this process occurs at
   lower pH than for MeHgBr and MeHgI, respectively, according to their
   stability constants. Gas/liquid distribution coefficients of
   MeHg-compounds have been determined in a temperature-range of
   25-80-degrees-C; the volatility of the compounds decreases in the
   following order: MeHgI > MeHgBr > MeHgCl > MeHgOH. Addition of potassium
   halides to MeHgCl-solutions results in a salting-out effect; for iodide
   this effect could not be observed experimentally since it was obscured
   by side-reactions, In the presence of excess iodide, MeHgI is partially
   transformed into the ionic MeHgI2-, and in acidic regions, an additional
   decomposition reaction of methylmercury takes place. Both side-reactions
   were also observed when an excess bromide was added, but to a lesser
   extent; in a chloride matrix, none of these side-effects seemed to take
   place. In methylmercury solutions at very high pH, besides MeHgOH, also
   MeHg(OH)2- is formed.}},

   4.5-degree-C and with a mean total retention time of 21.2 days. The
   results of the operation of these ponds over a 12-month period were
   analysed to verify the value of the first-order, complete-mix approach
   to design. Some appreciable support for the use of this approach was
   elucidated for the design of faculative ponds, particularly for the
   removal of faecal coliforms. First-order reaction coefficients of 0.357
   d-1 at 30-degrees-C for BOD5 removal (filtered effluent samples) and of
   15.7 d-1 for faecal coliform removal were established for facultative
   ponds. Some attention was also given to various design approaches
   relating areal loading to temperature but with the limited temperature
   range available few conclusions could be drawn.}},

Abstract = {{An optimization model of the activated sludge wastewater treatment
   systems was presented. Such a system was relatively complex, containing
   a series of unit processes, each designed to achieve a specific goal.
   The design basis of each unit in the system, which consists of primary
   settling, aeration and secondary settling tanks was given. The model was
   run at the varying dissolved oxygen concentration. A relationship was
   developed between sludge volume index and sludge age using data from
   literature. The relationships between sludge volume index and
   coefficients of solids flux model, V0 and n, were also found separately.
   An optimum design model was developed for the system. In the
   optimization model, relationships mentioned above were considered. The
   model was solved by using the Box-Complex Algorithm. The results
   obtained from the model were discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrification does not occur in conventional fish ponds or in oxidation
   ponds. Yet, intensive nitrification occurs in continually aerated and
   mixed fish ponds and in activated sludge systems. In a combined fish
   pond system, water from a conventional pond is pumped through a
   continually aerated and mixed pond, with a 5 h average hydraulic
   residence time. Unlike other aerated ponds, nitrification did not occur
   in this case.
   The masons for nitrification inhibition were studied in laboratory and
   field experiments. Inhibited nitrification was not due to any factor
   associated with water composition and persisted even when the water was
   replaced. In addition, it was not limited by a lack of inoculum.
   Nitrification in a laboratory assay started immediately in samples taken
   from a continually aerated pond, while it started only following a 24-48
   h lag period in water sampled from a conventional pond or from the
   combined pond system.
   Nitrifying bacteria have to adapt to the partial anoxic conditions in
   the conventional pond. It is assumed that the lag period is needed by
   the reverse process, adaptation to oxic conditions. The ecological and
   practical implications of this phenomenon are discussed. The lag period
   is needed when nitrifiers are transferred from anoxic to oxic conditions
   as a protective mechanism to ensure that nitrification will take place
   only if continuous or long-term oxic conditions prevail.}},

Abstract = {{The successful development of a laboratory-scale sequencing batch
   reactor (SBR) denitrification process to treat and reuse nitrate
   ion-exchange brine is described. Whereas previous research has focused
   on the use of a continuous upflow sludge blanket reactor (USBR) to
   denitrify 0.36 N NaHCO3 or 0.17 N NaCl brine containing up to 700 mg
   NO3-N l-1, this work examines the feasibility of using an SBR to
   denitrify 0.5 N NaCl brine containing up to 835 mg NO3-N l-1. The
   influence of salt concentration on denitrification rate was investigated
   with artificial brine at concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 N when methanol
   was the sole exogenous carbon source. After acclimation, the
   denitrification rate in 0.5 N NaCl was only 10\% lower than in the
   no-salt control reactor. The effect of mass ratio (R) of methanol to
   nitrate-nitrogen on denitrification rate and residual TOC in the
   denitrified SBR effluent was studied in the range of 2.2-3.2. At the
   optimum methanol-to-nitrate-nitrogen ratio of 2.7, the time for >95\%
   denitrification was 8 h. In one set of runs, actual spent regenerant was
   reused 15 times; each time it was denitrified in the SBR, filtered and
   compensated with NaCl before reuse. The research indicates that a
   denitrifying batch reactor provides simple operation, reliable effluent
   quality and compatibility with the inherent batch operation of the
   ion-exchange process.}},

Abstract = {{A quantitative survey of the protozoan microfauna at 17 activated sludge
   plants, has been carried out during a period of 1 year. The occurrence
   and abundance of the most important protozoans were compared with the
   operational parameters of the plant using multivariate statistical
   procedures. Principal component analysis (PCA) with Varimax rotation,
   performed on 19 species of protozoa and 7 physico-chemical parameters,
   revealed a clear relationship between the presence and abundance of some
   species and the prevailing environmental factors and plant operating
   conditions. In particular the shelled amoebae Arcella and Euglypha, and
   the sessile ciliate Vaginicola crystallina were directly associated to
   nitrifying conditions. Conversely, the sessile ciliates Vorticella
   microstoma and Opercularia spp showed an inverse relationship with the
   aforenamed operational condition and were directly associated with other
   plant conditions such as sludge loading, low dissolved oxygen in the
   aeration tank, and high BOD values in the final effluent.}},

Abstract = {{The disturbances in uniform creeping flow in the presence of an isolated
   porous floc are investigated theoretically. Using the Carman-Kozeny
   equation, the floc permeability is related to its fractal dimension, D.
   Fluid streamlines, drag coefficient and the fluid collection efficiency
   of porous aggregates are expressed in terms of D. As D increases, for a
   fixed packing factor and ratio of primary particle radius to floc
   radius, the permeability is found to decrease and the fluid mechanics
   resembles more closely that of an isolated impermeable sphere. As a
   simplification, it is suggested that a rectilinear model for flow up to
   an impervious sphere may be a reasonable approximation for
   aggregate-aggregate and particle-aggregate interactions if D less than
   or similar 2. Curvilinear models for flow up to an impervious sphere may
   be accurate approximations for interactions involving aggregates with
   higher fractal dimensions (D greater than or similar to 2.3).}},

Abstract = {{Metribuzin is a commonly used pesticide in Wisconsin and elsewhere,
   although contamination of groundwater by metribuzin has received little
   attention. A technique using solid phase extraction and high performance
   liquid chromatography was optimized to allow measurement of metribuzin
   and its major metabolites-deaminated metribuzin (DA), diketometribuzin
   (DK) and deaminated diketometribuzin (DADK). Percent recoveries and
   precision of metribuzin and DA analyses were good. Recoveries and
   reproducibility of DADK were acceptable (about 65\%). However, the
   recoveries for DK were low (about 35\%; the precision of the analysis
   was good, however). Overall, accuracy and precision were as good as, or
   better than, reported in the literature. Metribuzin and metribuzin
   metabolites were found in most of the groundwater samples analyzed from
   a number of wells located in sandy soil areas of Wisconsin. The parent
   metribuzin compound was found at concentrations ranging from not
   detected to 10.2 mug/l, while metabolite concentrations ranged from not
   detected to nearly 2 mug/l. Metabolites, which have been rarely reported
   to occur in water, were found in most of the samples even when the
   parent compound was absent.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of nucleophilic substitution of biologically mediated sulfide
   as a potential mechanism for dechlorination during anaerobic treatment
   of kraft mill bleach plant effluents was investigated. Batch anaerobic
   biodegradative studies employing a prepared solution of chlorinated
   organic matter with a low concentration of anions revealed that sulfate
   supplementation, with subsequent production of sulfide by anaerobic
   fermentation, did not significantly increase the extent of
   dechlorination. Competition with other degradative mechanisms, such as
   reductive dechlorination was concluded to be responsible for the reduced
   impact of sulfide on AOX removal in biological studies. Substantially
   more inorganic chloride was produced than could be accounted for by AOX
   reduction during the batch tests. Subsequent analyses revealed that the
   total chlorine concentration in the original effluent was greater than
   the sum of the AOX and chloride concentrations. It was concluded that
   the excess chloride produced in the batch tests resulted from the
   degradation of chlorinated organic matter which was not detected by the
   AOX technique.}},

Abstract = {{Two strains of Alcaligenes eutrophus AEO106 were used to inoculate
   expanded bed biofilm reactors which were exposed to a range of
   concentrations and loading rates of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
   (2,4-D herbicide). Two bench-scale reactors were inoculated with
   bacterial strains containing different plasmids. Plasmid pRO101
   expressed the 2,4-D degradative pathway in the presence of inducer
   (2,4-D or 3-chlorobenzoate), whereas plasmid pRO103 was engineered to
   allow constitutive expression of the pathway due to the deletion of a
   regulatory gene. Biofilm growth characteristics, loading rate and 2,4-D
   conversion efficiency relationships were compared in the two reactors.
   Actual loading rates tested ranged from 3.6 to 52.3 g 2,4-D per liter
   expanded bed volume per day (g/ld). The range of influent concentrations
   tested was between 166 and 728 mg/l (0.017 and 0.078\%). Mineral
   nutrients were supplied in the feed solutions. At loadings up to 15
   g/ld, reactors were aerated with filtered air. Pure oxygen was found to
   be necessary at higher loadings to sustain maximum bacterial activity.
   Removal of 2,4-D to below detectable concentrations (<3 mg/l) was
   demonstrated at all but the highest loadings tested (at least up to 10
   g/ld with air and >25 g/ld with pure oxygen). However, minimum effluent
   chemical oxygen demand (COD) values were 25 mg/l even at lower loading
   conditions. Advantages noted with the AEO106 pRO103 (constitutive)
   biofilm included greater biomass development (up to 3 times higher
   volatile solids), 50-100\% higher specific substrate conversion rates,
   quicker response to step increases in feed rate and concentration and
   more consistent effluent quality. Approximately one-third lower effluent
   COD concentrations, with one-half the standard deviation among
   individual analyses, were noted with pRO103 compared to pRO101. The
   genetically engineered biofilm reactor was shown to be a viable
   experimental treatment technology for one xenobiotic compound in these
   studies. However, pure culture conditions were not maintained throughout
   the experiments because of the low-level persistence of a sporadic
   contaminant bacterial species (identified as Xanthomonas maltophilia),
   which apparently incorporated plasmids from Alcaligenes eutrophus
   AEO106.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-exposure photographic method and an image analysis system were
   used to measure the terminal settling velocities and some geometric
   characteristics of digested sludge particle aggregates larger than 35
   mum (>90\% of the sludge mass). It was found that the aggregates larger
   than 150 mum showed low settling shape factor values, indicating their
   irregular structure. The density of the aggregates decreased with the
   increase in their size and was calculated by neglecting or accepting the
   irregularity of their structure. The terminal settling velocities of the
   aggregates, in a settling medium of filtered supernatant diluted 1:2
   with tap water, were proportional to their diameter rising to the power
   of 0.67. A correction factor, incorporating the settling shape factor,
   was formulated for the determination of the hydrodynamic properties of
   the aggregates studied. Their solid volume fraction was expressed by a
   three-parameter empirical model.}},

Abstract = {{Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis transport was studied in
   water flowing through laboratory columns packed with 0.5-mm silica
   beads. The rate of bacterial attachment to the silica was shown to reach
   steady state after about one pore volume of bacteria-containing solution
   had passed through the column. Column-outlet concentrations were 6-80\%
   of inlet concentrations. There was less P. fluorescens retardation at pH
   5.5 versus 7.0; since the pH(iep)s (isoelectric point) for both bacteria
   are at lower pHs, this difference indicates that the change in
   electrostatic repulsion over this pH range was relatively unimportant in
   determining bacteria retention in the porous medium. Transport of both
   species was highly retarded, suggesting that neither could be quickly
   transported over long distances in sandy soils. Results were adequately
   described using a steady-state transport model with bacterial attachment
   to soil as a pseudo-first-order process. Sticking efficiency (alpha),
   calculated using the steady-state colloid-filtration model, was near
   one. The continued appearance of bacteria in the column effluent for
   several pore volumes after switching to a bacteria-free inlet solution
   shows attachment to be reversible, though slowly reversible.}},

Abstract = {{Batch-tests were used to determine the potentials of digested sludge to
   reduce nitrate and nitrite in the presence of five different carbon
   sources: glucose, glycerol, acetic acid, lactic acid and methanol.
   Ammonium accumulation was found in glucose and glycerol media.
   Dissimilatory reduction to ammonium accounted for up to 50\% of reduced
   nitrate and nitrite. The rest were denitrified. In the media containing
   these carbon substrates volatile fatty acids, particularly acetic acid,
   were produced and ammonification was higher than denitrification
   activities only when glucose and glycerol were still present in the
   media. Ammonium production was higher in nitrite cultures than in
   nitrate cultures. In the culture media with acetic and lactic acids and
   methanol, ammonium was not detected. Nitrate/nitrite reduction in acetic
   and lactic acids media was essentially denitrification activity. Up to
   100\% of reduced nitrate and nitrite in the culture media with these
   acids were denitrified at average rates between 27 and 23 mg N-NO(x)/g
   MLVSSh, nitrite reduction rate being about 14\% lower than total nitrate
   reduction rate. COD requirements for nitrate and nitrite reductions were
   generally lower in cultures with acetic and lactic acids than in glucose
   and glycerol cultures. Methanol culture media showed a very small
   reduction rate for the N-NO(x) indicating the absence (or presence in
   very small quantity) of the bacteria capable of denitrifying with this
   substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Lake Kinneret (Lake Galilee) water has a high bromide content that
   affects the chlorination process. Disinfection by products (DBP) of
   highly chlorinated lake water were studied. By combination of GC-MS and
   HPLC, six haloacetic acids, in which four of them containing bromine,
   were identified. Tribromo, dibromochloro, and bromochloro acetic acids
   were found for the first time in high concentrations in chlorinated
   surface water. Total haloorganic (TOX) formation per unit carbon was low
   compared with other water sources. THM and dihaloacetic acids formation
   per unit carbon were in the common, reported ranges, trihaloacetic acids
   and unidentified TOX had low yields of formation. The TOX was
   characterized by a high fraction, over 50\%, of THM. The identified THMs
   and haloacetic acids accounted for about 75\% of TOX. Brominated species
   constituted over 85\% of the THMs and haloacetic acids. Tribromoacetic
   acid was found to undergo decomposition to form bromoform. This
   distribution of the TOX was the result of the following factors: (1)
   efficiency of bromination process compared with chlorination, (2) high
   content of aliphatic precursors and (3) decomposition of tribromoacetic
   acid to bromoform.}},

Abstract = {{The possibility of using ground, dried and classified Pinus sylvestris
   bark for trivalent chromium removal in tannery wastewater `'polishing''
   was studied. Tests were carried out with synthesized solutions whose
   chromium concentrations (5 and 20 mg/l) were similar to those found in
   some effluents of Portuguese tannery industries after physico-chemical
   treatment. Bark concentrations of 1 and 2 g/l were used (higher
   concentrations would have no practical value) and chromium removals
   greater-than-or-equal-to 90\% were achieved in a 4.5-5.0 pH range.
   Agitation was accomplished by means of both air bubbling and vibrating
   plate. Slight differences occurred. Bark wetting was achieved either by
   simple bark/solution contact or vacuum application. No marked
   differences were observed. From an industrial point of view air bubbling
   agitation and simple bark/solution contact certainly look more
   interesting. The presence of other ions decreased the chromium removal
   though this decrease was never greater than about 20\%. Pretreatments of
   bark were carried out and, in some cases, an increase of about 6-11\% in
   the chromium sorption capacity of bark was observed.}},

   was operated as an anoxic selector. Although filamentous microorganisms
   regularly occurred, the sludge settled properly. Deterioration of SVIs
   was observed after increasing the oleic acid concentration in synthetic
   wastewater. The bulking period was related to the abundant growth of
   viscous zoogloeal colonies. The intensive foam production resulted from
   the excessive appearance of exocellular polymers. A structure of short
   intertwined fingered projections formed the zoogloeal flocs. After
   decreasing the oleic acid proportion in the synthetic wastewater to the
   original level the zoogloeal flocs gradually changed to the
   well-settling sludge in 3 weeks.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoride forms a common aqueous effluent in many chemical industries.
   Excess of fluoride in the effluent can cause a health hazard. So,
   effluent containing fluoride needs treatment to reduce its concentration
   to a disposable value before discharge into public sewage. By
   conventional methods, the fluoride concentration in the industrial
   effluent can not be reduced to less than 10-15 mg l-1 without the help
   of dilution with fresh water. A method of chemical treatment is
   discussed here which has been very effective to remove the fluoride ion
   from effluent to a concentration of 1.5 mg l-1 or less (which is
   disposable) by precipitation technique followed by complexation. In this
   method, precipitation reduces the fluoride ion to a concentration of
   about 15 mg l-1 and the balance (1.5 mg l-1) is complexed to a stable
   form which being already totally dissociated at that low concentration
   does not break on further dilution. This improved method has made it
   possible to save a huge quantity of fresh water which otherwise is
   needed to dilute the fluoride effluent after conventional treatment in
   order to meet the statutory requirement.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical basis of the methods allowing to determine and calculate
   methanogenic and non-methanogenic sludge activities in anaerobic
   digesters are examined and, accordingly, proper experimental conditions
   are established. Some operational parameters of batch experiments like
   initial substrate concentration and inoculum size can be estimated from
   the expected kinetic constants. Methods based on the theoretical
   considerations are proposed and employed in order to evaluate: (a) the
   maximum methanogenic activity of anaerobic digester sludges, (b) the
   maximum hydrolytic and acidogenic activities and (c) the kinetic
   parameters corresponding to methanogenic, acidogenic and hydrolytic
   steps. Results show that maximum methanogenic activity of sludges from
   anaerobic reactors may be determined accurately by using small vials
   connected to Mariotte flasks with an alkaline fluid. A different
   procedure based on head space gas chromatographic analysis was also
   evaluated. This method is suitable to determine very low methane
   productions and may be applied to the methanogenic activities
   determination at substrate concentrations lower than the half-saturation
   constant. The activity tests were advisable to determine either the
   specific microbial activity, expressed by a sole parameter (i.e. maximum
   specific activity); or the kinetic of substrate consumption, that

Abstract = {{An electrochemical reactor for softening water has been perfected. The
   best results, without excessive scaling of the electrodes or the
   membrane, have been obtained with a cationic membrane as a diaphragm. In
   the cathodic compartment, an increase of the concentrations of Ca2+ and
   CO32- can be noted. The cations are transferred through the membrane
   under the effect of an electrical field. Anions are produced by
   electrolysis or by chemical reactions. These favour the acceleration of
   calcite crystalline growth by reducing the time necessary for the first
   germ to form. The softening of the anolyte depends on the current
   strength, the flow rate and the number of Ca2+ transport ions in the
   membrane.}},

Abstract = {{Acridine orange direct count (AODC) is a popular method for determining
   microbial numbers in environmental samples via epifluorescence
   microscopy. We have found that the color of the fluorescing cells (green
   vs orange-red cells) depends on the level of moisture on the filter and
   that the percentage of green-fluorescing cells decreases when the filter
   is dry. Since the level of moisture can vary across the filter and is
   difficult to control in any case, the use of color as a basis for
   inferring cell activity is not justified. The proportion of cells
   fluorescing green on a previously dried filter can be greatly increased
   by remoistening the filter prior to microscopic examination. This is
   advantageous since cells which fluoresce green are more easily
   visualized than orange red fluorescing cells. We therefore propose
   modification of the Standard Methods protocol for AODC to include the
   remoistening step.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleic acid hybridization has been used to detect viral nucleic acid in
   water. This type of assay, in contrast with tissue culture assays, may
   not distinguish between viable and non-viable viruses. We evaluated, by
   comparison with tissue culture infectivity assay (plaque forming
   method), the ability of the gene probe assay to detect viable poliovirus
   1 (LSc) in well water, autoclaved well water, filter-sterilized well
   water and autoclaved phosphate buffered saline kept at 37 and
   15-degrees-C for 75 days, and in dechlorinated tap water held at room
   temperature. A gradual decline in numbers of poliovirus was observed in
   all of the samples by cell culture assay. With the exception of
   autoclaved well water and phosphate buffer, a parallel decline in virus
   detectable by gene probe occurred in all other water samples. These
   results suggest that detection of poliovirus 1, by gene probe, is
   influenced by the presence of microorganisms or their products and to a
   lesser extent by temperature. This suggests that in some natural waters,
   the detection of poliovirus 1, by gene probe, may be expected to
   correlate to detection by tissue culture.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescently labelled latex microbeads were used to study the
   interaction of particles with Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms in a
   continuous flow annular reactor. Beads were readily distinguished and
   enumerated in both intact and disaggregated biofilm samples. The
   fraction of beads that attached to biofilm during a 24 h period ranged
   from 0.001 to 0.01 and was proportional to biofilm cell carbon and to
   the standard deviation of biofilm thickness. Microbeads added to biofilm
   of steady state thickness (30 mum) were observed to be located
   throughout the entire biofilm depth in 24 h. Many of the microbeads that
   attached to biofilm shortly after bacterial inoculation (thickness of 2
   mum) remained near the substratum as cells grew past and covered them.
   Microbeads were observed near the biofilm substratum interface for up to
   5 days after bead addition. Beads formed aggregates on biofilms, but not
   in bulk water. Beads captured by biofilm remained in the reactor system
   longer than beads that never attached to biofilm.}},

Abstract = {{Soil cores and surface soil samples were taken from two hazardous waste
   land treatment (HWLT) units and analyzed for organics and metals. One
   HWLT site was in operation at the time the samples were taken and had
   been used for this purpose since 1958. The other site had been used for
   research purposes for 3 years and had been closed since 1979. Refinery
   process wastes had been applied at both sites. The soil samples were
   analyzed to understand the accumulation of waste residues that could
   occur at HWLT sites and the pattern of residue spatial variability that
   resulted from waste application. Such information is relevant to: (a)
   potential leachability of accumulated organics and metals and possible
   contamination of groundwater and (b) site closure decisions and
   subsequent site use. Volatiles and acid extractables were not found in
   the soils. Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds and freon
   extractables were the major organics found. In surface soils of these
   sites. the concentrations of the organics and metals were greater than
   in background soils. At depths below 60 cm, the concentrations of PAH
   compounds were below detection limits. For the sites at which metal
   concentrations could be compared to that in background soils, the
   concentrations of chromium and nickel in site soils at depths below 60
   cm appeared greater than background soil concentrations whereas the
   concentrations of copper, lead and zinc in site soils at such depths
   appeared comparable to those in background soils.}},

Abstract = {{The cascade crossflow air stripper provides the capability at the design
   stage of independently varying the cross-sectional areas for air and
   water flow. This flexibility results in a greatly reduced gas-phase
   pressure drop and permits stable operation at air and water flow rates
   which would cause flooding in a countercurrent column. Experimental
   results from a laboratory-scale cascade crossflow packed column have
   been coupled with design calculations to show the feasibility of
   stripping compounds such as 1,2-dichloroethane and methyl ethyl ketone
   which are not easily amenable to countercurrent air stripping. For
   1,2-dichloroethane, comparable experimental stripping efficiency in
   countercurrent and cascade crossflow modes was achieved with a pressure
   drop reduction in the cascade crossflow mode of approximately two orders
   of magnitude. High efficiency stripping of less volatile methyl ethyl
   ketone requires large G/L ratios which would flood a countercurrent
   column. In contrast, the large G/L ratios can be achieved in the cascade
   crossflow mode, and design calculations based upon the experimental
   results suggest that 95\% efficiency can be achieved using a column of
   reasonable size.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Evaluation of the potential hazard of treated water can be performed in
   two basic ways: chemical identification followed by chemical-by-chemical
   hazard summation or by means of biotesting the water as if the
   contaminants were a single compound. Current practice is somewhere in
   between. For the most part, the use of bioassays is limited to a single
   test system, and the results are usually interpreted as either positive
   or negative. That is, binary information is the usual result of a
   bioassay evaluation. Our work over the past decade has facilitated the
   development of an alternative approach to interpreting bioassay results.
   The key element in our approach is the use of relative comparisons.
   Relative comparisons between responses of a given test system using
   wastewater and a well-known agent allow a graded response for each
   different bioassay. By using a battery of different bioassay systems,
   each with different mechanisms of toxicity. we are able to characterize
   the composite toxicological response to a wastewater sample with respect
   to a well-studied `'reference'' chemical. The value of this approach is
   that, if the use of the reference chemical has acceptable fisk to the
   majority of the population or at least a known human risk, the
   wastewater can be evaluated with respect to that factor. We use water
   chlorination as a `'reference'' material in this report to illustrate
   the concept.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effectiveness of granular activated carbon
   (GAC) for removing off-flavor compounds of water-geosmin and
   2-methylisoborneol (MIB). More specifically, it focuses on the
   development of an appropriate modeling approach and experimental
   protocol for the design of fixed-bed GAC adsorbers. Adsorption
   equilibrium, rate and long-term mini-column studies were conducted on a
   bench-scale for geosmin and MIB to estimate the equilibrium and
   mass-transfer parameters required for adsorber modeling. The dispersed
   flow homogeneous surface diffusion model (DFHSDM) was used for the
   prediction/simulation of the adsorber dynamics. Scale-up procedures
   based on dimensional analysis and similitude were employed for the
   design of full-scale adsorbers from bench-scale adsorbers, and for
   performance forecasting of full-scale adsorbers under different
   operating conditions. More importantly, operation and maintenance (O \&
   M) costs were estimated for full-scale adsorbers directed at the removal
   of off-flavor compounds, based on carbon utilization rates and disposal
   costs. These estimates were obtained for different plant capacities and
   empty bed contact times (EBCTs).}},

Abstract = {{By means of an experiment a concentration technique of organic
   micropollutants in raw water has been developed. This technique is based
   on the continuous pump, from the river bed, of an unchanging flow of
   21/h on various solid supports (activated carbon, XAD-2 resins). By
   means of solvent extraction from the supports, using CH2Cl2 and diethyl
   ether respectively, followed by concentration of the eluate using a
   rotary evaporator, a concentration factor-related to the raw water-of
   approx. 10(6) is obtained. This method provides us with an integrated
   sample corresponding to the 30 day period of the test. In this paper we
   present the results obtained in the study of micropollutants in the
   Ardisa Dam (Gallego River). The chemical analysis of acid and base +
   neutral fractions by gas chromatography connected to a mass spectrometer
   (GC/MS) has allowed us to identify more than 220 different chemical
   substances: aromatic hydrocarbons, chloride compounds, aromatic
   heterocycles, terpenes, steroids, plasticizers, aldehydes, ketones,
   quinones and esters. Of these, 22 are included in the list of the 130
   substances liable to appear on the 76/464/EEC Directive and 21 have been
   quantified.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous measurements of the upwelling and downwelling irradiances,
   along with phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, suspended matter and dissolved
   organic matter concentration at over 20 water bodies throughout the CIS,
   Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria, are reported in this paper. The
   measurements cover different trophic states of water bodies. from
   oligotrophic to hypertrophic, and different climatic conditions. The
   range of chlorophyll-a is 0. 1 350 mg m-3, suspended matter is 0.1-66 mg
   l-1 and dissolved organic matter absorption, al a wavelength of 380 nm,
   is 0.1 12 m-1. All radiometric measurements were performed with a single
   radiometer in the 400 750 nm range with spectral resolution better than
   1 nm. Factor and signature analysis, as well as multispectral
   statistical modeling of water quality parameters versus simulated
   spectral band ratios, made possible the determination of appropriate
   functions of reflectance for estimating phytoplankton chlorophyll-a,
   suspended matter and dissolved organic matter concentrations, One set of
   measurements was used to develop empirical relationships between the
   spectral reflectance and the above-mentioned water quality parameters.
   The other sets of measurements were used to test these relationships.
   The maximum errors of estimation are: 3 mg m-3 for chlorophyll-a, 4 mg
   l-1 for suspended matter and 0.065 mgC m-3 for dissolved organic matter.
   The results are used to develop an appropriate methodology for
   monitoring of eutrophication processes in inland waters.}},

Abstract = {{A model describing the objective evaluation of colour from the
   transmission properties of natural waters was developed and applied to a
   wide range of Australian waters. These calculated colours show that
   measurement of filtered water absorbance at 456 nm calibrated against Pt
   Co colour standards agrees with the visually perceived colour intensity
   by comparator methods and the Pt -Co or Hazen scale of measurement
   within a maximum error range of +/- 20\%. The error is significantly
   larger when analytical wavelengths below 440 nm are used. The
   interference to colour measurement caused by scattering of suspended
   matter was accounted for at the analytical wavelength. The light scatter
   component was found to be significant when the ratio of turbidity (in
   nephelometric turbidity units) to colour (in Hazen units) is greater
   than 0.02. The use of the 456 nm wavelength is proposed for the
   standardization of colour measurement in natural waters.}},

Abstract = {{The solubilization of metals from aerobically digested sewage sludge was
   performed biologically using Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, in a
   continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). Experiments involved the
   preacidification of the sludge to pH 4.0 and the addition of 4 g
   FeSO4-7H2O per liter of sludge. Reactors were operated with 20 g/l total
   solids (2\% TS), 0.5 volume of air per reactor volume per minute,
   agitation at 300 rpm and a 20\% recirculation rate. A minimal mean
   hydraulic residence time (t) of 0.75 day, one half the time required in
   a batch system, resulted in solubilization of 52\% of the Cu, 62\% of
   the Zn and 78\% of the Mn. The leached sludge was more easily dewatered
   than untreated sludge, and would not likely require the addition of
   polymer if a plate filter press were used. Metals did not reprecipitate
   during filtration. A small quantity of added lime was sufficient to
   precipitate the metals; selective precipitation could permit the
   separation of ferric hydroxide from valuable metals (Cu, Zn, Ni, Cd),
   which may then be recovered. No significant changes in the total
   nitrogen and phosphorus content occurred during solubilization.
   Biological solubilization produced a better quality sludge for
   agriculture, as well as avoiding the dispersal of metals into the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of an appropriate settling velocity model is
   indispensable to calculate secondary settlers of an activated sludge
   system by using the solid flux theory. Starting from the Carman-Kozeny
   equation, new settling models were developed by adding the slurry
   viscosity term. To correlate the settling velocities with the
   corresponding solid concentrations, Talmage and Fitch's method was
   utilized. The initial settling period was corrected by Hultman and
   Hultgren's method. Sedimentation experiments were carried out with a
   glass column (1 m height, 0.1 m diameter). To observe the variability of
   the settling characteristics of a flocculated slurry such as activated
   sludge caused by repetitions of sedimentation and homogenization, clay
   slurries flocculated with polyacrylamide were used. To verify the
   settling models, activated sludge slurries from a wastewater treatment
   plant were used. Six models with two parameters were compared. A newly
   deduced model v = k exp(-nx)/x fitted the experimental data best, and
   another new model v = k (1 - n.x)4/x gave a better fit than v = k (1 -
   nx)3/x.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the effects of oxidation on heavy metal behavior
   in sediments, the changes in chemical phase distributions of heavy
   metals with oxidation of sediments from Lake Teganuma were investigated
   using a sequential chemical extraction procedure for heavy metals.
   The exposure of sediments from the lake bottom to atmosphere caused the
   increase of Eh and the decrease of acid volatile-S in sediments. Most of
   the cadmium is expected to exist as relatively stable forms such as
   sulfides in original reduced sediments prior to exposure to the
   atmosphere. With the oxidation of sediments, Cd in the sulfidic/organic
   fraction were transformed to forms in the exchangeable and the reducible
   fractions which are easily dissolved. The chemical phase changes of Cu,
   Pb and Zn in sediments were less drastic than the case of Cd. Cadmium
   distinctly affected by the change in redox potential in sediments, and
   its behavior in the oxidized state is most mobile. Compared to Cd, the
   behavior of Cu and Pb are not so remarkably affected by the change in
   redox condition of sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of wastewater formed during production of citric acid and
   fodder yeast was carried out under dynamic conditions on a laboratory
   scale in an anaerobic upflow biofilter. The bioreactor was run at a
   temperature of 36-degrees-C. Methane fermentation of wastewater from
   citric acid production proceeded with a high yield. Removal of 73\% COD
   and 73\% BOD, was achieved at a biofilter loading rate of 3.16 kg
   COD/m3d and a 48-h hydraulic retention time of the wastewater. In
   addition, 65 and 70\% reductions of COD and BOD5, respectively, were
   attained with respect to wastewater from fodder yeast production at a
   biofilter loading rate of 3.00 kg COD/m3d and a 60-h hydraulic retention
   time. The methanogenesis process yielded 0.32  m3  CH4/kg of removed COD
   for citric acid wastewater and 0.34 m3 CH4/kg of removed COD for
   wastewater from the fodder yeast production plant. Microbiological
   reduction amounting to 50\% of sulphates was found to occur in
   wastewater from the fodder yeast production plant at an initial sulphate
   concentration of about 4500 mg SO42-/dm3.
   As determined by Oleszkiewicz's formula, the specific coefficients of
   the reaction rates, k, were 2.90 and 2.02 kg COD/m3 d depending on the
   type of wastewater. Consequently, it has been shown that the anaerobic
   upflow biofilter is suitable for treating wastewater produced during
   molasses processing. Attention should also be drawn to its unique and
   simple construction and the relatively low power demand required to
   operate this unit. Wastewater recirculation was not required in the
   unit.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the plasmids in wastewater bacteria was carried out. From
   the results of comparative studies on plasmid screening methods, the
   method of Kado and Liu was considered to be most suitable for detecting
   plasmids in wastewater bacteria among the five methods tested. Forty
   five antibiotic resistant bacteria and 10 dominant bacteria were
   isolated from wastewater samples, and their plasmid contents were
   examined by using Kado and Liu's method with minor modifications. In
   total, 31 plasmids were detected in 14 of 45 antibiotic resistant
   strains, with 10 strains carrying multiple (2-4) plasmids. Their sizes
   were in the range of 1.8-168 kb, and plasmids with sizes 20-30 kb and
   less than 10 kb were dominant (29 and 26\%, respectively). Several large
   plasmids detected in antibiotic resistant strains seem to be
   conjugative. On the other hand, 4 of 10 dominant strains had multiple
   (4-9) plasmids, and 63\% of them were less than 10 kb. So it appeared
   that plasmids were ubiquitous in wastewater bacterial populations.}},

Abstract = {{Five filtration models were used to predict the effect of particle size
   on removal in several types of laboratory filters (nylon, cellulose and
   glass fiber). All, models predicted similar trends in removal with
   particle size, although the capillary-pore model predicted substantially
   lower removals than the other four fibrous filtration models. These
   models indicated that bacterium-size (approximately 1 mum) particles are
   removed in filters primarily through the filtration mechanism of
   particle interception. Based on advertised pore sizes, removal of
   bacterium-size particles was a function of filter material in the order
   cellulose > nylon > glass fiber. The percent of bacteria removed in a
   nylon filter (5 mum pore diameter) was similar to removal in GF/C
   filters (1.2 mum pore diameter) as a result of a higher sticking
   coefficient of bacteria with nylon than with glass. The average sticking
   coefficients of three bacteria, Pseudomonas sp. JS6, Pseudomonas
   fluorescens P17 and Bacillus pumilus, in glass fiber (GF/C) filters,
   were 0.01, 0.24 and 0.20, respectively. These results indicate that
   filtration models can be used to describe particle removal during
   laboratory filtration of water and wastewater samples, and that bacteria
   have relatively high sticking coefficients for filter materials.}},

Abstract = {{Description of the unsteady-state behaviour of the activated sludge
   process of wastewater treatment has attracted much attention, yet there
   have been few exhaustive assessments of the resulting models against
   field data from full-scale plants.  This paper presents results for the
   evaluation of a model for carbonaceous and nitrogenous substrate removal
   with reference to a comprehensive set of data obtained from a 10-day
   monitoring exercise at the Norwich Sewage Works in eastern England. The
   model of the aerator is a simplified version of the IAWPRC model of the
   activated sludge process. The model of the secondary clarifier employs a
   conventional empirical expression for clarification and a conventional
   flux theory for thickening. Solute transport through both the aerator
   and clarifier is characterized by appropriate arrangements of fixed and
   variable-volume CSTR elements. Substrate removal and the production,
   thickening and recycle of biomass (suspended solids) are well replicated
   by the model. However, fundamental weaknesses are apparent in the
   currently available representations of the clarification function.
   Impacts of recycled flows from a sludge consolidation tank are also
   examined; sensitivity tests with the model suggest that these flows are
   a significant factor in the longer-term maintenance of aerator biomass
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{Flotation and sedimentation behaviour of single Microcystis colonies
   taken from a dense surface bloom in Lake Kasumigaura were analyzed on
   the basis of a geometrical model. In the analysis, a Microcystis floc is
   assumed to have a self-similar structure composed of identical spheres,
   each of which represents a domain occupied by a single cell which is
   surrounded by a slime layer. Invoking Stoke's law, an applicability of
   this model to the vertical movement was examined by three different
   experiments: (1) measurement of the flotation velocity of single algal
   flocs as a function of floc diameter; (2) measurement of the settling
   velocity of single algal flocs whose gas vacuole was collapsed due to
   the application of high pressure; (3) enumeration of cells which
   constitute a single floc. The results of these experiments consistently
   indicated that the Microcystis floc has the fractal dimension of 2.5,
   implying the validity of the applied model and Stokes' law. On the basis
   of this result, further discussion to treat the size of the domain
   occupied by a cell surrounded by a slime layer and the density of a cell
   was conducted by using transmission electron micrographs which visualize
   the amount of gas vacuole in a cell.}},

Abstract = {{The stoichiometry and kinetics of Co2+ reduction with NaBH4 in aqueous
   solution have been studied.  A substantial excess of borohydride is
   needed to achieve complete Co2+ removal from water, mainly due to
   borohydride consumption in the BH4-/H2O reaction unless the pH is
   sufficiently alkaline. In this case, cobalt precipitation occurs mainly
   as Co(OH)2. Absence of dissolved oxygen in the reactor is required to
   avoid rapid reoxidation.of reduced cobalt. The elemental analysis of the
   reduced species is consistent with Co2B.  The ease of sludge reoxidation
   and the final boron concentration in the effluent resulting from the
   needed excess of borohydride are serious disadvantages of this technique
   for Co2+ removal. A kinetic model has been proposed to describe the
   behaviour of the system. The model reproduces reasonably well the
   experimental results, although some discrepancies were observed in the
   early stages of the process. These can be mainly attributed to
   mass-transfer limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Field investigations into the mixing and decay of discharge plumes
   containing total residual chlorine (TRC) concentrations of 2.0 mg/l were
   conducted in the North Saskatchewan River downstream from two water
   treatment plants in the City of Edmonton, Canada. Environmental
   concentrations of TRC within the receiving body were found to be a
   function of the hydraulic mixing characteristics of the receiving stream
   and of the chemical decay of residual chlorine. In-stream TRC
   concentration profiles resulting from steady-state discharges were
   monitored at downstream locations. Dilution of the plume by the
   receiving stream was quantified by calibrating a two-dimensional mixing
   model to the mixing characteristics of the North Saskatchewan River
   using results obtained from steady-state dye-tracer studies using
   Rhodamine WT. First-order decay coefficients for TRC within the North
   Saskatchewan River were obtained by modelling the chlorinated plume
   mixing and fitting a first-order decay coefficient to the observed field
   data. Gross first-order decay coefficients attributed to all chlorine
   sinks except dilution and adjusted to a standard temperature of
   20-degrees-C were found to be, at two different locations, 20 and 28

Abstract = {{Underwater sediments of two Dutch moorland pools, Gerritsfles and
   Kliplo, have been compared statistically with respect to total S and
   S-related sediment contents. Horizontal and vertical distribution of S
   in the two pools are significantly different from each other.
   Statistical analyses indicate that spatial variation of S in Gerritsfles
   is probably due to variation in inorganic S contents and in Kliplo due
   to variations in organically bound S.
   As evidenced by this study, a choice for a measurement unit like mass
   fraction (g g-1) or volumetric Mass (mg cm-3) is crucial for the
   interpretation of spatial variability. In spatial studies of sediment
   constituents, it is essential to express contents of these constituents
   in volumetric mass fractions, since spatial sediment patterns are often
   obscured by spatial variations in bulk density. Taking spatial
   variability into account may highly affect the quantification of
   S-budgets of pools or lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The oxidation of atrazine in water by means of direct photolysis at 254
   nm and with hydrogen Peroxide combined with a u.v. radiation has been
   studied. The influence of bicarbonate/carbonate ions and a commercial
   humic substance on the oxidation rate has been observed. Depending on
   the initial atrazine concentration conversions higher than 99\% can be
   achieved from both types of oxidation in less than 15 min. The oxidation
   rate is especially fast with the combination of hydrogen peroxide and
   u.v. radiation. The humic substance applied slows down the rates of both
   types of processes because it absorbs radiation and scavenges hydroxyl
   radicals. There is an optimum initial concentration of hydrogen
   peroxide, about 0.01 M, above which the oxidation rate of atrazine
   decreases. The quantum yield and hydroxyl radical reaction rate constant
   of atrazine were found to be 0.05 mol photon-1 and 1.8 x 10(10) M-1 s-1,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Ozone and chlorine dioxide have been used as oxidants to eliminate
   gallic acid and epicatechin, two pollutants of distillery wastewaters.
   In the ozonation, the kinetic regime of absorption has been investigated
   being slow and moderate to fast for gallic acid and epicatechin
   ozonations, respectively. Rate constants of ozonation were obtained from
   competitive oxidation of phenol and the organics studied, being 13,300
   and 102,700 M-1 s-1 for ozone-gallic acid and ozone-epicatechin
   reactions, respectively. Chlorine dioxide was also found to be an
   effective oxidant. With this oxidant, gallic acid and epicatechin
   disappear in less than 5 min when the ratio between initial
   concentrations of chlorine dioxide and the organic is higher than 1.
   Comparing with ozonation, it was observed that both oxidants have a
   similar capacity to eliminate both organics, that is, the same amounts
   of oxidant are needed to oxidize the same amounts of gallic acid and
   epicatechin. Chlorine dioxide oxidation, however, requires much less
   time than ozonation to reach that situation because ozone mass transfer
   slows down the oxidation rate.}},

Abstract = {{A new method of solving the homogeneous surface diffusion model for
   activated carbon absorption makes use of Laplace transforms on the
   equations developed by applying orthogonal collocation. The simultaneous
   equations which are developed are non-linear so an iterative method is
   introduced to make them solvable when one wishes to calculate the
   surface diffusion coefficient, D(s), and the film transfer coefficient,
   K(f), from batch adsorption data. The proposed model has the advantage
   of being continuous in time in contrast to earlier models which relied
   on finite difference numerical methods to solve the system of equations
   comprising the homogeneous surface diffusion model. The model is applied
   to one data set from the literature. The proposed method gave values of
   K(f) and D(s) nearly identical to values found by other investigators.
   The model was applied to three new data sets obtained in our
   laboratories: an agricultural waste, a dye waste and an aqueous waste
   stream containing a herbicide. The industrial wastes were composed of a
   mixture of species, whereas the herbicide waste contained a single
   organic compound. The model produced a good match between experiment and
   prediction for all waste streams. The final form of the equations is
   presented in a form readily useable by the person interested in
   applications to carbon adsorption bed practice.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of Hg and its distribution within nymphs of the
   burrowing mayfly Hexagenia rigida (Ephemeroptera) were investigated
   experimentally by exposure of nymphs to radiolabelled Hg in laboratory
   microcosms containing water and sediment. Mercury was introduced into
   the experimental units either in the overlying water (twice-daily
   additions) or in the sediment (single addition prior to introduction of
   the nymphs). At the whole animal level, Hg accumulation varied according
   to the chemical form of the Hg added and the contamination source. When
   added in an organic form (CH3HgCl), Hg was accumulated to a greater
   extent than when added in an inorganic form (HgCl2); the ratio of
   accumulation between the two compounds exceeded 60 (organic/inorganic
   exposure) when Hg was introduced via the sediment but was only about 2
   when Hg was added to the overlying water. The distribution of Hg among
   the various body parts of the nymphs indicated that the Hg burdens in
   two major target organs-the gills and the gut-depended strongly on the
   initial contamination source. When Hg was added via the sediment, the
   contribution of the gut to the total body burden (43\% for inorganic Hg,
   18\% for methyl-Hg) was much greater than that of the gills (3 and 5\%,
   respectively). In contrast, when Hg was added to the overlying water,
   the contribution of the gills to the total body burden (49\% for
   inorganic Hg, 20\% for methyl-Hg) exceeded that of the gut (8 and 17\%,
   for the two forms, respectively).}},

Abstract = {{An advanced monitoring system for controlling the treatment process of
   wastewater containing chromium(VI) was developed using a flow method as
   a chemical sensing probe. In this, system, the acquisition of monitoring
   information and the control of the treatment process is
   computer-controllable. By application of the system to control the
   end-point of redox-treatment, an accuracy and precision better than +/-
   0.9\% (n = 5) and a relative standard deviation smaller than 0.5\% (n =
   5) were found; furthermore, safe discharge of wastewater can be ensured
   without the addition of any coprecipitation reagents.}},

Abstract = {{Toxicity, in terms of growth inhibition of the green alga Selenastrum
   capricornutum, was measured on a series of 26 river water samples taken
   over a period of 19 months. The aim was to verify if the measured effect
   was influenced by nutrient enrichment, and by the subsequent biomass
   increase. For each sample, the three values of percent inhibition
   measured on the untreated sample, on the enriched sample and on the
   additional yield due to enrichment were calculated. Significant
   differences were observed between these three sets of data. The
   relationship between the measured values was expressed mathematically by
   means of an equation correlating their differences. The biological
   explanation of the difference between the responses of the enriched
   samples and the unenriched ones lies in the fact that a drop in toxicity
   seems to correspond to the increase in biomass which occurs in the
   enriched sample.}},

Abstract = {{Using experimental microecosystems the kinetics of phenol disappearance
   in river and reservoir water were investigated. In river water the
   disappearance kinetics could be described by A first-order equation, the
   same kinetics took place in reservoir water before and after the period
   of `'bloom'' of blue-green algae. During the `'bloom'', the phenol
   seemed to be mineralized by bacteria which grew at the expense of
   another compound, and the model of best fit was the model of exponential
   growth and low concentration of the test substrate. In the river, two
   sections differed according to the difference between the mean values of
   the specific disappearance rates. In the reservoir these rates were
   lower than those in the river. In general the specific disappearance
   rate values did not correlate with the values of initial
   bacterioplankton density, the concentrations of inorganic nutrients nor
   the chemical oxygen demand. Conclusions about the integral influence of
   ecosystems on the disappearance rates and dependence of
   self-purification kinetics on the type of aquatic ecosystem were made.}},

Abstract = {{The modelling of ozone transfer in water must take into account
   classical ozonization parameters as well as the type of the fluid flow
   in the reactor. Even if the disinfection norm proposed in 1987 by the
   American Agency for the Environmental Protection favours the plug flow
   reactor, many industrial reactors differ from that ideal reactor. Some
   of them are even closer to the perfect mixed tank. In order to compare
   the efficiency of different reactors and to determine the influence of
   the ozonation conditions on the dissolved ozone profiles all along each
   reactor, four programs are designed: the two types of ideal reactors,
   the plug flow and the perfect mixed reactor, the reactor with an axial
   dispersion in the liquid phase, the reactor with three different axial
   dispersion zones; this model is in agreement with the study of the
   residence time distribution made in a pilot unit.
   These programs are discussed and compared with experiments performed in
   an ozonation pilot tower. They are very useful to define the type of
   reactor which must be used depending on the ozonation aim and to
   determine the treatment conditions depending on the water composition.}},

Abstract = {{The speciation of inorganic tin and organotin compounds is studied in
   raw water samples and in filtered water samples collected along the main
   steps of the wastewater treatment plant of Bordeaux City (France).
   Analyses are performed by hydride generation, cryogenic trapping,
   chromatographic separation and detection by atomic absorption
   spectrometry. Results show that dissolved inorganic, methylated tin
   (mono-, di-, trialkylated forms) and butyltin compounds (mono- and
   dialkylated forms) occur at all stages of the water treatment process.
   Butyltins were found at low concentration levels which tends to show
   that the weathering of PVC is a minor phenomenon. High methyltin
   contents were however found which illustrate the high methylation rate
   in sewage water; a general removal trend from the water is observed for
   inorganic and methyl-tin species both in raw water and filtered water
   samples. Volatilization of tin compounds is observed in the anaerobic
   fermentation steps of the activated sludge. Possible pathways for
   transformation of tin (methylation, volatilization) during the
   wastewater treatment are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition of volatile chlorohydrocarbons in the gas and aqueous
   phases is tested in a thin, rectangular-channel reactor. In the absence
   of u.v. irradiation, destruction of pollutants in the gas phase hardly
   occurs, while there is a little in the aqueous phase. Ultraviolet
   irradiation accelerates the destruction of pollutants in both the gas
   and aqueous phases, and the destruction rate is proportional to the
   concentration of reactants and the u.v. intensity. To evaluate the
   effect of reactor configuration and operational conditions on the
   performance of the actual water treatment process, a bubble column
   equipped with a diffuse lamp along the central axis is adopted as a
   model reactor. The conversion of volatile chlorohydrocarbons and the
   ozone utilization efficiency are calculated by considering the mass
   transfer of ozone and pollutants between the gas and aqueous phases, and
   the self-decomposition of ozone and destruction rate of pollutants in
   each phase under u.v. irradiation. A simulation on the basis of the
   experimental data obtained predicts that excessive u.v. radiation
   decomposes ozone in the gas phase before it is transferred into the
   aqueous phase, causing a decrease in the utilization efficiency of
   ozone.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Co, Fe, Zn, Mn, Pb and Ni were determined
   in water, suspended solids and surficial sediments of the River Tigris
   at the Samarra impoundment during high (April) and low (July) river
   discharge months in 1988. The recorded concentrations in water were
   either significantly lower or within the Iraqi river water standards and
   the average clean river water of the world. Variations in the
   concentrations of heavy metals in suspended solids were interpreted to
   be due to local differences in current velocity and distance from the
   shore line (from sewage source of the residential sector). The
   concentrations of most of the examined elements in the surficial
   sediments (except for Mn and Fe during April) were lower than those in
   the suspended solids. Results stress the importance of the suspended
   solids in transportation of heavy metals in the River Tigris. Higher
   concentrations of Co, Mn and Fe are discussed in relation to
   sedimentation process and the nature of the river basin.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic energy-budget model (DEB model) was extended to describe the
   growth of Nais elinguis, a common oligochaete species frequently
   occurring in sewage treatment plants. Nais elinguis reproduces asexually
   by dividing into an anterior and a posterior naidid. The daughter
   naidids initially have different growth rates due to differences in
   energy reserves. The fit of the model showed a good description of the
   length measurements. The parameters of the model, such as maintenance
   rate coefficient and energy conductance, which represent physiological
   features of the organisms, facilitate insight into the processes
   underlying naidid growth. A numerical method was developed to predict
   asexual reproduction. The presented model is a first step towards a more
   comprehensive knowledge and modelling of organisms in an activated
   sludge plant and is therefore interesting from a wastewater management
   point of view.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the effect of phosphate limitation on reactor performance
   and on methanogenic activity was examined. Laboratory scale UASB
   reactors were fed with gelatin or volatile fatty acids as COD substrate
   while the phosphorus content of the substrate was varied. Phosphate
   uptake was investigated using the granular sludge which was developed in
   the phosphorus-deficient reactors.
   Phosphorus deficiency reduces methanogenic activity in UASB reactors to
   50\% of the control. This reduction was found to be reversible by dosage
   of phosphate. In batch experiments a complete recovery of the maximal
   methanogenic activity was observed by a dosage of 5 mg PO4-P l-1. At low
   concentrations (0.1 g PO4-Pl-1) phosphate dosage is also profitable.
   When the applied sludge loading rate was below the methanogenic activity
   of the sludge under phosphorus-limiting conditions, the treatment
   efficiency was not affected. The sludge growth however was slightly
   reduced. Overdosage of phosphate, which in practice is related to high
   effluent phosphate concentrations, was found to be unprofitable.}},

Abstract = {{To study the possibility of removing nitrogen and organic halogens from
   bleached kraft pulp mill effluent, we investigated nitrification and
   dechlorination in a laboratory scale fluidized-bed reactor. The
   nitrifying reactor was fed with ammonia and exposed to
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol as a model substrate. The reactor responded with a
   decrease in the production of nitrate and acid. Nitrification recovered
   after six days of continuous 2,4,6-trichlorophenol feed and inorganic
   chloride began to accumulate into the effluent. When the application of
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol was repeated, no inhibition of nitrification was
   observed and dechlorination began with no lag phase. Inorganic chloride
   release and total organic carbon removal pointed out that
   2,4,6-trichlorophenol was dechlorinated and mineralized in the reactor.
   Batch experiments showed that enzyme synthesis was necessary for the
   adaptation of the nitrifying biofilm to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol
   dechlorination. 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone formed as an intermediate
   product from 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. The electron micrographs of the
   biomass revealed bacteria morphologically similar to known ammonia
   oxidizing species: mainly Nitrosomonas and Nitrosospira.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid granular activated carbon (GAC) expanded-bed reactor designed
   to decouple biological removal from physical removal and a GAC
   expanded-bed reactor were studied under similar operating conditions.
   The hybrid GAC reactor consisted of a GAC expanded-bed reactor which was
   retrofitted with a GAC adsorber containing 11.1\% of the total GAC mass
   in the system. A synthetic wastewater composed of acetate and
   3-ethylphenol (3-EP) at influent concentrations of 5 g acetate/l and
   1.5-2.5 g 3-EP/l was used at COD loadings of 18.7 23.8 kg COD/m3.
   Partial replacement of GAC in both reactors facilitated the physical
   removal of 3-EP. GAC was replaced from only the side adsorber in the
   hybrid GAC reactor while GAC was replaced directly from the GAC reactor.
   Previous studies indicated that increasing GAC replacement rates washed
   biomass out of the GAC reactor while the hybrid reactor was resilient to
   changes in operating conditions. This study compared the reactors while
   maintaining a constant GAC replacement rate with an increasing influent
   loading of the inhibitory/refractory compound, 3-EP. The performance of
   the GAC reactor deteriorated with increasing 3-EP loading rates until
   reactor failure occurred due to inhibition. The hybrid reactor responded
   to increases in the influent 3-EP loading rate with greater than 60\%
   biological removal of 3-EP and only minor changes in effluent quality.
   Termination of GAC replacement in the hybrid reactor allowed for almost
   complete biological removal of 3-EP in the hybrid reactor. The
   resilience of the hybrid GAC reactor was attributed to the accumulation
   and maintenance of a stable microbial population capable of degrading an
   inhibitory substrate.}},

Abstract = {{The biofilter system proposed and tested here, for upgrading irrigation
   water, is based upon the use of a carbonaceous material, such as wheat
   straw, as a substrate for microbial activity. Microorganisms degrading a
   carbon-rich and nitrogen-poor substrate are expected to take up nitrogen
   from the water. When wastewater flows along a column of the carbonaceous
   substrate, a sequence of nitrification and denitrification is also
   possible. Moreover, the biofilter may `'trap'' phosphorus, suspended
   matter and possibly soluble organic matter. Each biofilter (a l m3 PVC
   tank containing 50 kg of wheat straw) was fed by water from an oxidation
   pond at a rate of 60-65 l h-1. The biofilter system performed with no
   clogging or other hydraulic problems for a period of 63 days. The
   capacity of the filter was at least 2 m3 water for each kg of straw.
   The biofilter removed 50\% of the ammonium from the input water, 65\% of
   the suspended matter and 75\% of the algal biomass. In addition, the
   leachates from the biofilter were more uniform than the raw pond water,
   the composition of which fluctuated within a wide range.
   Besides its smooth operation, the raw straw was enriched with protein
   during the operation of the filter. The initial protein content of the
   straw (about 3\%) rising to 12-15\% by the end of the experiment. It is
   anticipated that the spent straw may be used as a manure, or, probably
   following silage, as a valuable feed material.}},

Abstract = {{The actual practicability of biological treatment of effluents heavily
   polluted by phosphoric compounds is evaluated in this paper. Preliminary
   batch tests have shown that high COD levels inhibit phosphorus release
   during anaerobic conditions but allow, at the same time, a more
   efficacious removal during the subsequent aerobic stage. Removal yields
   exceeding 60\% have been calculated for an influent COD level of about
   840 mg/l. The A/O process, suitably modified so as to alternate aerobic
   and anaerobic phases in the same reactor, has been tested for the
   biological removal of phosphorus in synthetic wastewaters with high
   phosphate concentrations. The start-up phase, carried out with a
   synthetic solution having a starting phosphorus concentration of 10
   mg/l, showed average phosphate and COD removals of 78 and 90\%,
   respectively. The results obtained after reaching steady-state
   conditions, by feeding P concentrations up to 100 mg/l, seem to indicate
   this process as an excellent means of reducing phosphorus emissions into
   the environment and therefore may contribute to the solution of
   eutrophication-related problems. Removals higher than 90\% have been
   assured for wastewaters containing phosphate levels up to 70 mg/l; at
   higher concentrations, the system proved capable of tolerating phosphate
   overloading for no more than 10 days; yield then rapidly fell to zero.}},

Abstract = {{The dilution method is used to obtain an indirect count of
   microorganisms, e.g. fecal bacteria commonly used as human contamination
   indicators, in a suspension. The Most Probable Number estimate provides
   a quantification of dilution method results. This estimate is commonly
   obtained by using Poisson distribution. Although the use of binomial
   distribution leads to lower estimates, only a 5\% maximum difference was
   noted, which is negligible in terms of MPN precision. Relative MPN bias
   is considerable (35\% on average) and apparently varies with true
   bacterial density; however the binomial model reduces its magnitude by
   5-8\%. A new method for determining Bayesian intervals based on an
   equilikelihood criterion is presented. This method provides narrower
   intervals which include more likely bacterial densities. A simple
   application is given to indicate the inaccuracy of MPN estimates within

Abstract = {{A survey of air and water loading rates in counter-current packed towers
   used in air-stripping applications revealed that they are designed to
   operate at low loading rates relative to incipient flooding limits. This
   paper presents a theoretical analysis of some advantages and
   disadvantages of operating counter-current packed towers at high loading
   rates. A simple modification of the conventional counter-current system
   proposed previously as a cascade air-stripping system is shown here to
   be capable of accomodating high loading rates. Results of previous
   prototype tests are presented to demonstrate the possible benefits of
   operating counter-current packed towers at higher loading rates.}},

Abstract = {{Trihalomethane (THM) in drinking water is formed by chlorination of

   precursors in the water of the Tormes river (Salamanca, Spain) using

   kinetics were examined under conditions such that the formation of
   trihalomethane would be favoured, with a view to discovering the effect
   of different physico-chemical parameters on them such as pH, oxidant and
   humic acid (HA) concentration.
   A mechanistic model, based on the fact that on the macromolecule (HA)
   there are several sites that are highly reactive to sodium hypochlorite,
   is used to derive kinetic equations for the rate of THM formation as a
   function of humic acid and oxidant concentration under controlled pH and

Abstract = {{Waste sludge from laboratory units at four different steady-state
   conditions (5- 20 days sludge ages) was employed for studying heavy
   metal shock load by the jar test system. Metal uptake (Hg, Cd, Ni) and
   oxygen depletion rates were simultaneously followed. The potential
   adsorption constants (k(am)) measured reveal a metal affinity sequence
   Hg > Cd > Ni, in partial contrast to the metal toxicity (MT) one, Hg >
   Ni > Cd. This suggests different sludge adsorption sites. Hg is
   preferentially adsorbed on the cell, while Cd is adsorbed on
   extracellular polymer slimes and Ni on capsular polymers and the
   cellular wall. Therefore sludge age influences Cd and Ni toxicity, while
   no effect is observed for Hg.}},

Abstract = {{A study on the physico-chemical structure of activated sludge flocs was
   carried out to get a better insight in its relationship with sludge
   settleability. For this purpose, 16 sludge samples from different
   origins were analyzed in order to provide information with regard to
   their settleability, biomass and exocellular composition, surface
   characteristics and internal hydrophobicity. The presence of filamentous
   microorganisms was observed in all samples but was not always associated
   with poor settleability, supporting to some extent the idea of their
   role as a backbone in the flocs. Relationships between the measured
   variables were studied through their linear correlations. A high amount
   of exocellular polymers (ECP) was associated with poor settling
   conditions. The DNA fraction and the C/N ratio of the ECP, had also a
   negative influence on the adsorption of a cationic molecule in the
   sludge samples. Finally, sludge settleability was described with a
   mathematical model which shows the opposition between ECP and the
   internal hydrophobicity of the flocs. From the model, the positive role
   of hydrophobic interactions should provide a new approach in the
   understanding of flocculation mechanisms in activated sludge.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of amines and/or potential nitrosating agents (nitrite and
   nitrate) present in water was studied in the amphibian Pleurodeles waltl
   (urodele). The genotoxic effects of secondary amines, atrazine (AT) and
   diethanolamine (DElA), alone or in combination with sodium nitrite or
   sodium nitrate, were evaluated on peripheral erythrocytes using the newt
   micronucleus test.
   At the maximum concentration (MC) which could be tested, neither AT (0.3
   ppm) nor DElA (75 ppm) were found to be clastogenic. Likewise, even at
   their respective MC, neither sodium nitrite (140 ppm) nor sodium nitrate
   (8000 ppm) induced the formation of micronuclei. Negative results were
   systematically obtained under all conditions examined (pH 8, 6 or 5;
   alternation or indirect natural daylight and darkness or continuous
   darkness; prior incubation of both precursors in the dark for 48 h).
   The genotoxic effects of N-nitrosamines suspected to be formed from such
   precursors were also evaluated. Larvae were reared in water containing
   non-toxic concentrations of N-nitrosoatrazine (NAT) (3.75, 7.5 and 15
   ppm) or N-nitrosodiethanolamine (NDElA) (6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 ppm). We
   found a significant difference in level of micronucleated erythrocytes
   between the lowest (3.75 ppm) and highest (15 ppm) concentrations of
   NAT. With NDElA, a dose-response relationship was observed at
   concentrations from 12.5 to 50 ppm.
   We suggest that at the concentrations used (close to those which may be
   encountered in a polluted natural aquatic environment), if NAT or NDElA
   are formed, the amounts produced are probably too low to yield a
   positive response in the newt micronucleus test.}},

Abstract = {{A speciation study of some metals (Al, Fe, Cu, Zn and Cd) was performed
   in the surface water downstream from a deposit with sulphidic mine waste
   where acidic leachates were neutralized by mixing with well buffered
   groundwater and surface run-off. The water was rich in humic and fulvic
   acids (HFA). The chemical forms of the metals were characterized with
   respect to their cationic and anionic exchange properties.
   In the present pH range (5-8) Al and Fe precipitated as solids that were
   partly retained by both cation and anion exchangers. Zinc and cadmium
   were dominated by cationic forms but for cadmium anionic forms were
   always present in minor amounts under the conditions of the study.
   Copper was predominantly anionic (as HFA-complex) except at low pH and
   high concentrations of Al and Fe, which evidently occupied all available
   complexing sites on the HFA.
   Conditional stability constants were estimated for the corresponding
   metal-HFA complex entirely from field data. The values obtained with
   this empirical method (logbeta{*} at pH 7; 4.7 Cu; 3.2 Zn; 4.0 Cd) are
   in reasonable agreement with measurements in controlled model systems.}},

Abstract = {{Changes occurring in the pH-stable fraction of high molecular weight
   (HMW) (> 1 kD) fraction of combined C- and E-stage bleachery effluents
   from hardwood and softwood kraft mills were followed over 16 weeks.
   Incubated in water at 20-23-degrees-C and neutral pH, this HMW material,
   generally considered to be the most refractory part of kraft mill
   effluent, showed substantial and continuing mineralization of its HMW
   adsorbable organic halogen (AOX) to chloride ions, via both
   daylight-dependent and daylight-independent mechanisms. Significant
   decreases were also seen in HMW color and apparent molecular size.
   Comparison of filter-sterile HMW material and the same material
   inoculated with settling pond sludge organisms indicated that, over 16
   weeks, microbial processes were not important in the observed HMW AOX
   mineralization or chromophore bleaching, and that the HMW carbon was
   largely unavailable, at least to the microbial consortium employed. The
   microflora did, however, reduce toxicity, as measured with the Microtox
   assay. Thus the results suggest that HMW kraft bleachery AOX degrades
   abiotically to release chloride over a relatively short time span (in
   ecosystem terms) under conditions similar to those typical of many
   receiving waters.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of horseradish peroxidase enzyme attached on three different
   reactor matrices: cellulose filter paper, nylon balls and nylon tubing,
   to remove 4-chlorophenol from aqueous solution is evaluated. The
   enzymatic reaction is extremely fast and the reaction products remained
   on the reactor matrix. Detachment or release of the reaction products
   from the reactor matrix is not observed. Results indicate that, over
   80\% removal efficiency can be obtained as long as enzyme activity is
   not limiting in the reactor. Systematic recycle batch reactor studies
   reveal that, initial reaction rates exhibit saturation with substrate
   concentration under conditions of excess peroxide. Inactivation of
   enzyme active sites by reaction intermediates is observed in the reactor
   studies. Immobilized peroxidase also catalyzes the oxidation of other
   chlorophenols and cresols.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in the structure of the protozoan community living in
   activated sludge were studied in relation with the organic loading rate.
   84 samples were taken over a 14 month period. Sludge and wastewaters
   were subjected to microscopic and physico-chemical analyses. The organic
   loading rate corresponding to each microscopic count was determined as
   the average of the values calculated for the 2 days previous to the
   count. Ciliate species abundance and specific diversity of ciliates were
   strongly related to the organic loading rate. Data were compared to
   three other facilities. Ciliate diversity decreased as the organic
   loading rate increased. This relationship could be modified if solids in
   suspension surpassed 4000 MLVSS mg/l or if volumetric loading rates were
   higher than 800 g BOD5/m3 day. An easy, fast diagnostic test to estimate
   the organic loading rate in less than 5 days and to obtain information
   on plant performance is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Regeneration of biomass cultivated by synthetic soluble organic
   substrate under oxic and anoxic conditions was studied by following the
   maximum substrate removal rates r(X,m) during the endogenous phase. Two
   semicontinuously operated units simulating contact stabilization process
   were operated. In one of the units endogenous anoxic period was
   established after nitrification was completed. The regeneration process
   was connected with an increase in r(X,m) values. The increase was very
   similar under both oxic and anoxic conditions. The comparison of the
   contact stabilization process with oxic and combined oxic-anoxic
   endogenous phase has shown the following: rates of exogenous substrate
   removal and nitrification were the same, in ox-anox system nitrogen was
   completely eliminated and oxygen consumption was reduced, the rate of
   regeneration was the same in both systems. Combined oxic-anoxic
   regeneration phase can be used as a modification of the contact
   stabilization process for soluble organic substrate. In addition, during
   the endogenous phase kinetic constants r(X,m), saturation coefficient
   K(s) and biomass yield coefficient Y have significantly increased. The
   problem of actual Y value determination is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Five groups of Daphnia magna were cultured up to the 11th brood on five
   graded food levels comprised between 0.6 x 10(5) and 5 x 10(5)
   cells/ml/day of both Selenastrum capricornutum and Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae and fed with equal amounts. Reproduction, adult body length,
   weight and age at first brood production were markedly affected by food
   rations. Minor or no effects were observed on neonate length and weight,
   though a negative relationship between neonate length and parental food
   ration was verified. In addition, it was observed that brood to brood
   oscillations of neonate weight and length are inversely related to the
   oscillations of mean brood size. Neonates from the last five broods were
   acutely tested for their sensitivity to two organic compounds of
   increasing lipophilicity, i.e. ethylbenzene (K(ow) = 3.15) and n
   -butylbenzene (K(ow) = 4.05). Toxicity test results at 48 h of exposure
   revealed only minor effects of feeding levels which could not be
   explained either by neonate weights or lengths which were measured for
   the broods tested. Present results show that reproductive strategy, i.e.
   the inverse relationship between brood size and neonate parameters,
   should be regarded as generic potential which can be activated to a
   variable extent and is also effective at constant food condition in the
   sequence of brood to brood variations.}},

Abstract = {{This research investigated loss of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAH) while attempting to bioremediate soils from a manufactured gas
   plant (MGP) site. Laboratory microcosms using site soils were used to
   evaluate how environmental factors, such as temperature, pH and
   nutrients affected PAH loss. Results indicated that: (a) PAH in the MGP
   site soil resisted mineralization by microorganisms; (b) test soils were
   non-toxic before and after testing; (c) significant populations of
   bacteria were present in the microcosms during the degradation studies;
   (d) addition of free naphthalene and phenanthrene to the soils resulted
   in rapid loss of the added chemicals while the concentrations of
   indigenous chemicals were unchanged; (e) PAH were not soluble in a water
   extract of these soils; and (f) the PAH in these soils were unavailable
   for microbial degradation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent legislation in the U.S. has forced the water treatment plants to
   use particle size measurements in conjunction with turbidity
   measurements to ensure the removal of pathogenic entities from drinking
   water. There is a general lack of information among the water treatment
   professionals about the intricacies and pitfalls of particle size
   measurements, particularly for samples with low particulate
   concentrations. This work focuses on how the sequence of sample analysis
   can affect the results obtained, if an improper analysis protocol is
   used. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate this point, the
   conclusion being that care should be taken in sequencing of samples for
   batch particle counts as well as in one-line particle size measurements.
   A protocol is presented that avoids such problems.}},

Abstract = {{A study was carried out to assess the effect of short-term temperature
   increases on the performance of a mesophilic (30-degrees-C) UASB reactor
   treating sulfate containing wastewater, with respect to process
   stability, process recovery and particularly the competition between
   sulfate-reducing and methanogenic and acetogenic bacteria. The reactor
   was fed with a synthetic medium consisting of acetate, propionate,
   butyrate and sulfate. Three temperature shocks in the range from 45 to
   65-degrees-C during an 8-9 h period were applied. A temperature shock of
   45-degrees-C did not show any detrimental effect. However, temperature
   shocks to 55 and 65-degrees-C gave a serious drop in the treatment
   efficiency. The exposure to 55-degrees-C is more detrimental for
   propionate and butyrate oxidation than for acetate oxidation. The
   exposure to 65-degrees-C is similarly detrimental for acetate,
   propionate and butyrate degradation. Recovery after both the 55 and
   65-degrees-C temperature shock is relatively fast for propionate
   oxidation, butyrate oxidation and sulfate reduction, but slow for
   acetate oxidation and methanogenesis. Prior to imposing the temperature
   shocks all hydrogen was oxidized by sulfate-reducing bacteria whereas
   acetate was mainly oxidized by methanogens. After exposure to
   65-degrees-C a shift was found with respect to acetate utilization by
   methanogens and sulfate reducers, leading to an apparent steady state
   situation in which 40 and 60\% of the removed acetate was oxidized by
   respectively sulfate-reducing and methanogenic bacteria. In additional
   batch experiments conducted at 55-degrees-C, a decay rate of 2.22, 1.93,
   1.75 and 1.33 h-1 for respectively propionate oxidizers, butyrate
   oxidizers, methanogenic and sulfate-reducing bacteria was found. At
   65-degrees-C the decay rate exceeds 10 h-1 for all bacteria involved in
   the conversion reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the addition of powdered
   activated carbon (PAC) to upflow floc-blanket reactors for the
   adsorption of natural and synthetic organic chemicals. A 15.5-1.
   bench-scale floc-blanket reactor was operated with PAC addition for the
   adsorption of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP) and natural organic matter
   from one groundwater and two surface waters under laboratory and field
   conditions, respectively. Influent TCP concentrations ranged from 21 to
   415 mug/l. The PAC doses ranged from 2 to 12 mg/l. While the hydraulic
   residence time in the floc-blanket reactor varied from 15 to 30 min, the
   carbon residence time ranged from 9 to 34 h. This is due to the high
   solids concentration in the floc blanket, which ranged from 1200 to 8700
   mg/l. Comparison between the extent of TCP adsorption through the
   floc-blanket reactor and the equilibrium adsorption isotherms of TCP on
   PAC showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of PAC for TCP was
   utilized in the reactor. However, this study showed that the maximum
   adsorptive capacity of the carbon in a continuous process is dependent
   on the influent adsorbate concentration. This was in agreement with
   isotherm studies conducted with varying initial TCP concentration. The
   maximum PAC adsorption capacity for natural organic matter was also
   achieved in the floc-blanket reactor.}},

Abstract = {{The WW-TREAT model was developed to predict the fate of consumer product
   chemicals in primary and activated sludge wastewater treatment plants
   using independently determined values for the distribution coefficient
   between sludge solids and liquid, Henry's law constant and
   biodegradation rate constants. The major difference between this model
   and previous models is that it assumes the total chemical, not just the
   dissolved chemical, is available for biodegradation and that sorption to
   sludge solids increases the time that a chemical is available for
   biodegradation. The model was validated with monitoring data for four
   chemicals which possess sorption and biodegradation characteristics that
   span the range typical of the broader class of consumer product
   chemicals. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the most important
   parameters were the plant operating parameter, sludge/solids retention
   time and the chemical specific parameters, distribution coefficient and
   biodegradation rate constants. The sludge/solids retention time had its
   greatest effect when it was less than 9 days and the distribution
   coefficient had its greatest effect when it was between 100 and 3000
   l/kg. The model predicted removal in primary and activated sludge
   wastewater treatment plants within 5\%. Thus, the model can be used as a
   valuable tool for predicting the fate of consumer product chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies using chlorine, hydrogen peroxide and ozone showed
   two responses by zebra mussel veligers. First, veligers readily
   perceived the presence of oxidants (> 0.1 mg/l for chlorine and ozone)
   and responded by retracting the velum and ceasing swimming and feeding
   activities. Under these conditions, veligers are prevented from
   attaching to solid surfaces. Second, continuous exposure to these
   oxidants caused death. Complete mortality by chlorine or ozone (0.5-1
   mg/l) at 18-22-degrees-C required continuous exposure of about 18 and 5
   h, respectively. Either chlorine or ozone should be effective in
   controlling zebra mussel veligers. Hydrogen peroxide was observed to be
   effective in preventing attachment but only at high doses relative to

Abstract = {{To assess soil-aquifer treatment of sewage effluent for removal of
   viruses, studies were conducted at a recharge/recovery site near Tucson,
   Ariz. Two 13 m2 basins were constructed in coarse sand alluvium, one for
   secondary- and one for tertiary-treated effluent. Bacterial viruses, MS2
   and PRD1, and a chemical tracer, potassium bromide (KBr), were added to
   effluent applied to these basins. Infiltration rates ranged from 0.2 to
   16.8 m/d. Samples of unsaturated flow from depths of 0.30-6.08 m below
   the basin were taken through porous stainless steel suction-samplers.
   Bromide and virus results indicated the presence of preferential flow
   conditions that produced irregular concentration profiles with depth.
   Virus transport was retarded (R = 1.9) at the beginning of a flooding
   cycle, but viruses were transported faster than the average water
   velocity (R = 0.47) when applied after the infiltration rate had
   declined following 4 days of flooding. Virus specific removal rates (b)
   during percolation through soil were 2.3-120 times greater than in
   bottles of effluent or ground water. PRD1 was removed more rapidly
   during percolation (b = 0.65 h-1) than MS2 (b = 0.23 h-1). Effluent type
   did not significantly affect b for MS2, but the PRD1 rate was nearly 3
   times greater with secondary effluent (1.0 h-1) compared to tertiary
   effluent (0.35 h-1). Virus removals at the 4.3 m depth ranged from 37 to
   99.7\%.}},

Abstract = {{The white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and its extracellular
   enzyme lignin peroxidase are both known to catalyze the transformation
   and, in many cases, the degradation of several hazardous compounds and
   are, therefore, promising candidates for application in hazardous waste
   treatment. The application of P. chrysosporium in large-scale waste
   treatment and commercial production of lignin peroxidase has been
   impeded by the lack of bioreactor systems yielding consistent production
   of high levels of lignin peroxidase under long-term steady state
   conditions and controlled growth of the fungus. The use of innovative
   biofilm systems, which minimize intensive shear and provide for fungal
   growth as a biofilm, was investigated. The viability of the use of a
   hollow fiber reactor and a stirred tank reactor modified into a unique
   silicone membrane reactor for the cultivation of P. chrysosporium and
   production of high levels of lignin peroxidase was demonstrated. The
   membrane reactor utilizes silicone tubing as a growth support and for
   oxygenation. The silicone membrane reactor was operated using a repeated
   batch technique, consisting of alternating growth and production phases,
   to yield production of lignin peroxidase over a period of 5 weeks and
   appears promising for application as a hazardous waste treatment
   process.}},

Abstract = {{A fluorogenic medium was developed by incorporating the fluorogenic
   substrate, 4-methylum-belliferyl-beta-D-glucoside (MUD), in a selective
   thallous carbonate nalidixic acid broth, in order to reveal the
   beta-glucosidase activity and appraise the growth of enterococci.
   The results obtained with pure cultures showed that 100\% of the strains
   of the major faecal enterococci (E. faecium E. faecalis, E. durans and
   E. hirae) produced beta-glucosidase and were recovered with a good
   efficiency at 44-degrees-C in the fluorogenic medium. Other genera in
   the Streptococcaceae and Micrococcaceae families, which have been
   reported to be easily mistaken for enterococci in routine analysis, were
   inhibited in this medium at an elevated temperature.
   The results obtained with raw surface water (24 samples), sewage (18
   samples) and animal faeces (35 samples), confirmed that the major
   contribution of our work, therefore, was the development of a
   direct-enumerating medium with 97.1\% confirmed positives and 2.2\% of
   false-negatives upon which the major faecal Enterococcus species would
   initiate growth and fluoresce.
   This fluorogenic medium was used to enumerate enterococci using a
   miniaturized multi-tube MPN procedure and compare this with the membrane
   filtration technique and the classical three-tube MPN test.
   The analysis of 13 freshwater and 23 English Channel and North Sea
   samples indicated that the fluorogenic assay and the standard methods
   had the same performance. In contrast, the miniaturized procedure showed
   by far the best specificity on 13 Mediterranean samples. A 100\%
   confirmation rate was observed with the fluorogenic assay while 44 and
   93\% false-positive rates were observed with three-tube MPN and membrane
   filtration, respectively.}},

   operated at hydraulic retention times of 1.8-4 h and influent PCE
   concentrations of 8-12 mg/l. Small samples (50 ml) of attached film
   media were used for batch testing 3-7 mg/l of PCE in a separate 300 ml
   AAFEB reactor. The attached films were a mixed anaerobic consortium
   grown on diatomaceous earth support particles under methanogenic
   conditions. Sucrose was used as an external electron donor and growth
   substrate. Reductive dechlorination of PCE to trichloroethylene (TCE),
   cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE), vinyl chloride (VC) and ethylene (ETH)
   was observed. The conversion efficiency of PCE and TCE to lesser
   chlorinated compounds and ETH was above 98\% during continuous-flow
   testing. VC accumulated as the major dechlorination product and ETH was
   produced at very low rates. The maximum PCE dechlorination rate, q(max),
   was 5.33 mg PCE/g volatile solids-day (32.1 mumol/g VS-d) and the
   one-half velocity coefficient, K(s), was 0.009 mg PCE/l (0.054 muM)
   under continuous-flow conditions. Since the AAFEB carried more than 20 g
   volatile solids per liter of bed, low temperature conversion rates would
   be expected to exceed 60 mg PCE/l(bed)-day. This indicates removal
   efficiencies greater than 99\% could be obtained at hydraulic retention
   times of less than 1 h at ambient groundwater temperatures with this
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Biological phosphorus removal was investigated under anoxic and aerobic
   conditions. Tests were made to establish whether phosphorus accumulating
   bacteria can take up phosphate under anoxic conditions and thus utilise
   nitrate as oxidant. Furthermore, it was tested how the amount of organic
   matter taken up by the phosphorus accumulating bacteria during the
   anaerobic phase affects the total denitrification rate, as well as the
   rate at which the phosphorus accumulating bacteria take up phosphate
   under anoxic conditions. The tests were conducted as batch experiments
   in 21. reactors with activated sludge from two different pilot plants
   incorporating phosphorus removal.
   The results showed that the phosphorus accumulating bacteria can be
   divided into two groups in respect of process: one group capable of
   utilising only oxygen as oxidant and another group capable of utilising
   both oxygen and nitrate as oxidant. The phosphorus uptake was more rapid
   under aerobic conditions than under anoxic conditions. The explanation
   of this is that all phosphorus accumulating bacteria take up phosphate
   under aerobic conditions, whereas only part of the phosphorus
   accumulating bacteria take up phosphate under anoxic conditions. There
   was a linear relationship between the amount of acetate taken up in the
   anaerobic phase, the denitrification rate and the phosphorus uptake
   rate.}},

Abstract = {{Biological treatability of an integrated dairy plant wastewater
   containing a small fraction of whey washwaters mixture has been

   of the initially inert fraction, S(I) and soluble residual microbial

   determine the kinetic and stoichiometric coefficients of the degradable
   COD. The results have shown that the wastewater tested had practically
   no initially inert fraction, but generated residual microbial products
   amounting to 6-7\% of the initial degradable COD. The results obtained
   have been fed into a set of equations describing the steady state
   operation of an activated sludge system with sludge recycle and a
   relationship indicating the variation of the total effluent COD with the
   sludge age has been defined for the wastewater tested. It is noted that
   effluent COD cannot be biologically reduced below 85 mg l-1, regardless
   of the sludge age, due to generation of residual fractions.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of a reservoir water release on water quality of the upper
   Seine river (France) was studied at the end of the summer of 1990. The
   flow from a storage reservoir was increased from 6 to 26 m3 s-1 within 8
   h for the purpose of the experiment, the river flow upstream from the
   reservoir being 4 m3 s-1. During the passage of the wave front and until
   the dilution by the reservoir water, water samples were taken at a high
   frequency for physico-chemical (temperature, dissolved oxygen,
   nutrients) and organic matter parameters (dissolved and particulate
   organic matter, phytoplankton and bacterioplankton). Due to the
   resuspension of sediments, the wave front caused a strong deoxygenation
   and an increase in nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic matter
   concentrations, as well as in the abundance and biomass of the
   organisms. Whereas all dissolved elements rapidly decreased after the
   passage of the wave front, particulate organic matter still increased. A
   trend towards a restoration of the oxygen diurnal cycle of the river was
   also observed, due to the photosynthetic activity; however, the initial
   oxygen level was not found because of high turbidity. Algal populations
   were dominated by periphytic organisms at the wave front passage and
   then replaced by phytoplanktonic ones before the arrival of the
   reservoir water; this suggests that particulate organic matter was kept
   at a high level by the contribution of the river hydraulic annexes (dead
   arms, gravel pits, etc.), flooded by the increase of the water level.
   Finally, a dilution by reservoir waters of better quality occurred. The
   impact of the water release is discussed in terms of ecological
   functioning of a river system.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution and movement of the sewage plume from McMurdo
   Station, Antarctica, was investigated in the ocean under the early
   summer sea ice. Ocean currents were also examined to determine their
   effect on the movement of the plume. Samples of sea water were obtained
   via holes drilled through the ice and analyzed for coliform bacteria.
   Coliform densities in ice cores were also determined. Densities of
   coliform bacteria as high as 10(5)/100 ml were found along the c. 1 km
   shoreline of McMurdo Station and the plume extended 200-300 m seaward.
   The relocation of the outfall from a surface configuration to the
   subsurface (11 m deep) had little influence on the distribution of the
   plume that sometimes reached the seawater intake station, 400 m to the
   south. Ocean current measurements in the study area confirmed that,
   while the prevailing advection was to the north and away from the intake
   area, episodic reversals of flow at some current meter stations
   coincided with pulses of sewage that moved to the intake. These findings
   support the use of bacterial indicators as one means to map the
   distribution and movement of recent sewage contamination in cold
   (-1.8-degrees-C) sea water and provide evidence that the disposal and
   movement of domestic wastes deserves attention in costal polar
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Solubilities and dissolution rates of colloidal gamma-FeOOH
   (lepidocrocite), one of the typical iron oxyhydroxides, in seawater over
   a pH range 5.5-8.2 at 20-degrees-C were experimentally determined by
   dialysis techniques involving gamma-activity measurements of Fe-59. The
   Fe(III) dissolution rate was closely in proportion to the concentration
   of particulate Fe(III) in seawater and was defined as a first-order
   reaction. The solubilities and dissolution rate constants within the pH
   range 7.0-8.2 were independent of pH with values of approx. 1 x 10(-9)
   mol l-1 and 0.005 day-1, respectively. This result probably indicates
   the existence of Fe(OH)3-degrees as well as Fe(OH)2+ in the normal pH
   range of seawater. The solubility and dissolution rate constants were
   one order of magnitude and one-third, respectively, lower than those of
   amorphous hydrous ferric oxide determined in a previous study. The
   Fe(III) dissolution rate of colloidal gamma-FeOOH at the normal pH of
   seawater can be estimated from 0.005 x {[}Fe(III)particulate] (conc.
   day-1) by the concentration of particulate Fe(III) as gamma-FeOOH in
   seawater. At lower pHs of 5.5-7.0, the logarithmic solubilities and
   dissolution rate constants increased linearly with decreasing pH with a
   slope of -1.0 and -0.95, respectively, indicating that Fe(OH)2+ is the
   dominant dissolved ferric species.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus retention (TP(acc)) was determined in 7 lakes in Ontario,
   Canada from mass balances and from the direct measurement of phosphorus
   accumulation in the sediments. Phosphorus retentions determined using
   the mass balance technique ranged between 20 +/- 4.0 and 95 +/- 23
   mg/m2/yr and were slightly lower than those calculated by multiplying
   sediment total phosphorus (TP) concentrations by sediment accumulation
   rates (49 +/- 14 to 148 +/- 37 mg/m2/yr). The lower TP(acc) values
   measured using the mass balance approach may result from the
   underestimation of external TP inputs. Alternatively, it is suggested
   that in the more acidic lakes, a decrease in TP concentrations in the
   lakewaters and/or a decrease in TP export from the catchment may have
   resulted in a decrease in TP(acc) through time. Thus, relatively higher
   TP(acc) values would be calculated using the sediment approach (since
   TP(acc) values calculated from the sediment data are averaged over a
   greater number of years than those calculated from the mass balance
   data).
   Provided several cores are collected from the lake, the direct
   measurement of sediment TP and sediment accumulation rates for
   estimating TP(acc) may be a suitable alternative to mass balances,
   especially in situations where it is not possible to measure all inputs
   of TP to the lake.}},

Abstract = {{Asellus aquaticus (L.) was exposed in microcosms to littoral sediments
   from Lake Ketelmeer (River Rhine estuary) and from a control site in
   order to study effects of substrate characteristics, temperature and pH
   on the kinetics of trace metal accumulation. Elimination patterns were
   studied in parallel experiments with preloaded animals kept on control
   sediment or in test water. In a 50 day semistatic bioassay at three
   different temperatures (5, 10 and 20-degrees-C) and two pH levels (7.3
   vs 8.1) a highly significant accumulation of Cd, Pb. Cu and Zn by the
   isopods was observed. No net uptake was recorded in animals kept on
   control substrates. The most marked accumulation by Asellus was noted
   for the non-essential trace metals Cd and Pb. Element-specific effects
   of sediment characteristics and temperature were encountered on
   sediment-water partitioning (Cd, Cu and Zn) and on accumulation and
   elimination kinetics (Cd, Cu and Pb). No significant effects were
   observed for the different pH levels. Accumulation of Cd and Cu
   increased significantly with temperature. Pb concentrations in animals
   exposed at 20-degrees-C were found to be significantly lower compared to
   other temperatures. The accumulation of Zn appeared to be unaffected by
   temperature. Two distinct elimination patterns were observed.
   Elimination of Cd and Cu was absent at the higher temperatures. A slight
   elimination of these metals was recorded only in some of the treatment
   groups at 5-degrees-C. Both elements seemed to be stored in stable body
   compartments. A relatively rapid elimination, not affected by
   temperature, was observed for Pb (biological half-life: 8-15 days) and
   Zn (half-life: 21-44 days): above the control sediments Asellus
   maintained a Zn concentration of c. 100-150 mug g-1 (dry wt). Several
   explanations for the observed accumulation patterns and temperature
   effects are presented. The results indicated that freshwater isopods
   could be suitable organisms for bioassays and biological monitoring
   studies on the bioavailability of sediment-bound trace metals.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of indigenous microorganisms to degrade benzene, toluene,
   ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) in laboratory scale flow-through aquifer
   columns was tested separately with hydrogen peroxide (110 mg/l) and
   nitrate (330 mg/l as NO3-) amendments to air-saturated influent nutrient
   solution. The continuous removal of individual components from all
   columns relative to the sterile controls provided evidence for
   biodegradation. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, the indigeneous
   microorganisms degraded benzene and toluene (>95\%), meta- plus
   para-xylene (80\%) and ortho-xylene (70\%). Nitrate addition resulted in
   90\% removal of toluene and 25\% removal of ortho-xylene. However,
   benzene ethylbenzene, meta- and para-xylene concentrations were not
   significantly reduced after 42 days of operation. Following this
   experiment, low dissolved oxygen (<1 mg/l) conditions were initiated
   with the nitrate-amended column influent in order to mimic contaminated
   groundwater conditions distal from a nutrient injection well. Toluene
   continued to be effectively degraded (>90\%), and more than 25\% of the
   benzene, 40\% of the ethylbenzene, 50\% of the meta- plus para-xylenes
   and 60\% of the ortho-xylene were removed after several months of
   operation.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of surface waters through the discharge of fecal material
   in surface run-off, combined sewer overflows and point source discharges
   is an important water quality problem in many urban environments. Field
   and laboratory studies were conducted to develop and verify the kinetic
   expressions and attendant coefficients required to simulate the loss of
   fecal coliform bacteria in lakes due to death {[}as mediated by
   irradiance (light) and temperature] and sedimentation. The dark death
   rate coefficient at 20-degrees-C (k(d) = 0.73 d-1) was established in
   laboratory experiments utilizing raw sewage diluted with filtered lake
   water. No consistent relationship was observed between the dark death
   rate coefficient and temperature (theta = 1). The irradiance-mediated
   death rate (k(i)) was shown to be proportional to irradiance (I) in
   water column incubations of raw sewage using a dialysis tube technique:
   k(i) = alphaI; alpha = 0.00824 cm2 cal-1. The settling loss rate (1.38 m
   d-1) was quantified by determining the association of fecal coliform
   bacteria with particles of various size classes and measuring the
   sedimentation rate for those particle classes using sediment traps.
   Individual loss terms are combined into a single predictive expression
   which may be used to simulate fecal coliform bacteria dynamics in lakes.}},

Abstract = {{The episodic nature of their origin and the transience of the receiving
   water response make the modeling of fecal coliform bacteria
   contamination events particularly challenging. A two-layer mass balance
   model was developed to simulate spatial and temporal variability in
   fecal coliform bacteria concentrations in a polluted, urban lake.
   Independently validated submodels were used to estimate bacteria loads
   from tributary and point source discharges, to quantify mass transport
   and to determine losses due to sedimentation and death. The overall
   model was validated by successfully simulating spatial and temporal
   dynamics for dry weather conditions and two wet weather events.
   Sensitivity analyses indicate that the likelihood of violating public
   health standards is influenced by environmental conditions, e.g. light
   intensity and wind mixing. Model simulations are used to illustrate the
   impact of water quality management actions on bacteria levels at various
   locations in the lake. The general approach presented here and the
   techniques used to quantify model inputs may be of value in application
   to other systems.}},

   To describe the GAC performance using mass transfer models, the DOC was
   broken down into fictitious components, and individual fictive component

   1990) with actual loading rates of 4.1, 7.7 and 16.7 l. d-1 m-2,
   respectively, and focused on the fate and transport of the biological
   tracers below each subsystem. The North Carolina design failed within 6
   months of installation because the effluent loading rate was too high to
   permit infiltration through the fine-textured soil at the site. The
   lower Virginia loading rate functioned better in terms of hydraulic
   performance and retention of bacterial and coliphage tracers, retaining
   > 99.9\% of the tracers, while the higher Virginia loading rate retained
   > 99\% of the tracers over all samplings.}},

Abstract = {{In wastewater treatment plants with enhanced biological phosphorus
   removal, the rate of aerobic phosphate uptake by activated sludge
   depends on previous phosphate release by polyphosphate-accumulating
   bacteria under anaerobic conditions. However, there has been
   disagreement as to whether the PO4 release is caused either directly by
   low concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) or by the lowered redox
   potential (ORP) at zero DO. The results from experiments in a
   laboratory-scale treatment plant with activated sludge from different
   full-scale plants indicated a direct DO dependence of phosphate uptake
   and release. In contrast, the ORP modified the rate of phosphate release
   only under certain conditions.
   Phosphate release began at values between 0.1 and 0.5 mg O2/l, depending
   on sludge conditions. At limiting DO concentrations, nitrate reduced the
   phosphate release in sludge from lowly loaded plants (with nitrification
   and denitrification zones) but not in sludge from highly loaded plants
   (without nitrification). In a pure culture of a
   polyphosphate-accumulating Acinetobacter strain (Br-2) phosphate release
   started only in completely anaerobic conditions. In sludge from sewage
   plants and in a pure culture of Acinetobacter, enhanced phosphate uptake
   began as soon as O2 was available for respiration.}},

Abstract = {{In aquatic systems with large specific areas (bottom surface area/volume
   of water), such as shallow streams or rivers, the growth of biofilms
   often determines the rate at which environmental contaminants are
   removed and degraded. Thus, understanding biofilm growth is critical in
   predicting the ultimate fate of chemicals in the aquatic environment.
   Through sequential acid hydrolysis and HPLC analysis of biofilms,
   bacteria and algae, our study provided the first direct biochemical
   evidence that the origin and mass of a biofilm was mainly derived from
   bacterial activity, thus justifying the approach of using the major
   carbohydrate component of microorganisms to approximate the mass of a
   biofilm. Our data also demonstrated the potential applicability of the
   carbohydrate method for biofilm mass estimation in various aquatic
   environments, as biofilm mass can be readily determined in the presence
   of seawater and hard water.}},

Abstract = {{Different types of poor quality water of three different turbidity
   ranges (5-7, 50-54 and 93-97 NTU) were prepared by adding stream
   sediments, digested sludge and raw sludge to stream water. Different
   concentrations of iodine (from 1.0 to 10 mg/l) were employed to
   inactivate E. coli in these samples at three pHs (6.0, 7.5 and 9.0) and
   three temperatures (5, 20 and 35-degrees-C). The results obtained were
   compared with those of an arbitrarily selected standard of 1.0 mg/l
   chlorine. Under all the conditions, for which dosages of 3.0 mg/l iodine
   were used in the samples containing stream sediments, a water with
   virtually no E. coli was obtained within a 30 min contact time. For the
   samples containing digested sludge, a dosage of 8.0 mg/l iodine was
   required to achieve the same quality water, whereas for the samples
   containing raw sludge, a dosage of 10 mg/l was only sufficient at the
   lowest investigated turbidities (5-7 NTU). Disinfectant capabilities of
   both iodine and chlorine declined with increasing temperature, pH and
   turbidity. The efficiency of 1.0 mg/l chlorine was slightly better than
   that of iodine in the samples containing stream sediments, but in the
   samples containing digested sludge and mw sludge the efficiency of
   iodine was to be found better than that of the chlorine especially at
   the higher temperature and pH values. Correlations were obtained between
   percentage removal of E. coli, the amount of disinfectant employed, the
   temperature and the quality of the water represented by pH and total
   oxidized carbon level.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{377-387}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The evaluation of bulk specific deposit values forms an integral part of
   deep bed filtration modelling. As the observations in filtration
   experiments are generally restricted to the monitoring of headloss and
   filtrate concentration (in mass units), estimates of only absolute
   specific deposit values (m/v) are possible. In many previous studies, a
   term known as the `'bulk factor'' is incorporated into the modelling of
   the filtration process such that the product of the bulk factor with the
   absolute specific deposit (m/v), gives an estimate of the bulk specific
   deposit (v/v). In these investigations the bulk factor is treated as
   constant. Alternatively, other authors have obtained the variation of
   the bulk factor with the absolute specific deposit by using Kozeny's
   headloss model. Thus, it can be seen that so far the process of
   obtaining a particular variation of the bulk factor and its subsequent
   use in the modelling of a filtration process has not been adequately
   considered. The present study presents a novel approach based on the
   development of sequential decision-making algorithms. It is concluded
   that this approach has the advantages of being computationally more
   efficient and avoids the need to assume a headloss model.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of chemical phosphate precipitants on heavy metal

Abstract = {{The inactivation of bacteria and coliphages by u.v. radiation was tested
   in a full-scale pilot plant with a flow rate of 180 m3/h. The
   investigated water contained about 70\% secondary effluent from sewage
   treatment plants and 30\% surface water. The minimal rated radiation
   density was 13.3 mW/cm2 (60\% of u.v. transmission in water), and the
   radiation exposure lasted for 3.54 s resulting in a u.v. radiation dose
   of 47 mWs/cm2.
   This type of u.v. radiation chamber decreased the concentration of total
   coliform organisms, E. coli, fecal streptococci, Salmonella sp. and
   coliphages in the influent by 1-2 logs. Strains of bacteria,
   Streptococcus faecalis and Salmonella enteritidis, seeded artificially
   into the influent showed a reduction of about 2-4 lop after u.v.
   radiation. The coliphage f2 was more resistant than the tested bacteria
   and reduced by less than 2 lop through u.v. radiation. The inactivating
   effect of u.v. radiation was counteracted by the binding of the
   coliphage f2 to suspended turbid particles.
   It can be recommended to use u.v. treatment of effluents of wastewater
   plants after a flocculation and filtration step to improve the
   efficiency of the u.v. radiation.}},

   technology for the treatment of wastewater are reported. This technology
   is based on a pressurized aerobic activated sludge bioreactor with a

   In respect to epidemic hygiene, the effluent quality corresponded to the
   quality of drinking water with almost no bacteria to be found in the
   effluent.
   During process development, tests were carried out with wastewater of
   different origins, different pressures and different solid
   concentrations within the activated sludge reactor. Using the membrane
   unit, tests were carried out with different types of membranes under
   variation of the velocity in the membrane tubes. In the paper presented,
   the results of tests with wastewater from the canning of sour vegetables
   are reported.}},

Abstract = {{Following commissioning of a small water treatment plant, the pH of its
   finished water dropped by 0.5 units during the fourth year. Concrete
   surfaces of storage tanks were degrading and submerged steel surfaces
   became colonized with large rust-coloured nodules. Changes in chemical
   additions along with engineering changes did not improve the symptoms.
   Raw water was taken from a eutrophic lake and contained high levels of
   hydrogen sulphide. Microbiological analyses of various plant sites
   yielded the presence of Thiobacillus neopolitanus and apparent
   autotrophic Pseudomonas spp. After evaluating the results a number of
   modifications were recommended and the major one was that a low hydrogen
   sulphide containing source water should be used. To address this
   recommendation the water treatment plant now uses water from a
   moderately sized river resulting in lower in-plant acid production and a
   better finished water.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure to measure dissolved organic halide formation potential
   (DOXFP) using monochloramine as the oxidant was developed. Dissolved
   organic halide (DOX), DOXFP, DOC and COD were measured before and after
   unit processes within municipal wastewater treatment plants. DOXFP
   reductions within the plants generally paralleled reductions in COD and
   DOC. DOX was removed less in biological processes in comparison to other
   organic surrogates, and DOX concentrations varied more than other
   surrogates within the plants. Neither DOC nor COD were satisfactory as
   surrogate parameters for DOX. Removal of all organic surrogates was
   small across settling basins. The reactivity of the organic matter as
   measured by the DOXFP/DOC ratio increased following biological
   treatment. A survey of ten facilities showed that effluent DOX values
   ranged from 56 to 1530 mug Cl/l. High DOX values were associated with
   high levels of industrial activity. The average raw wastewater DOX was
   150 mug Cl/l and the DOXFP was 669 mug Cl/l. Monochloramine oxidation of
   wastewater resulted in an average production of 10 mug DOX per mg of
   DOC.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of amperometric environmental sensor incorporating eukaryotic
   algae were investigated for use in monitoring pollution of aquatic
   systems. Both sensors allowed the monitoring of photosynthetic events,
   one by measuring the rate of reduction of a redox mediator by the
   illuminated biocatalyst, the other by monitoring its photosynthetic
   oxygen production using a semi-protected oxygen electrode. Comparison of
   sensor response obtained prior to challenge with pollutants with that
   following challenge allows rapid detection of disturbance in
   photosynthetic activity. The oxygen electrode-based biosensor gave good
   sensitivity with long operational life, and proved to be a better
   approach than mediator system to monitor algal biocatalysts for
   detection of aquatic pollutants displaying toxicity on photosynthetic

Abstract = {{Some studies on the role and behaviour of organic matter during
   coagulation of raw waters or solutions have been reported in the
   literature. As far as coagulation of dissolved humic substances is
   concerned, some general conclusions could be made from the studies. The
   best removal of these substances was obtained at pH 4-5 with ferric iron
   and between pH 5 and 6 with alum (Hall and Packham, 1965; Van Breemen et
   al., 1979; Jekel, 1985; Lefebvre and Legube, 1990). Fulvic acids were
   found to be less easy to remove than humic acids (Babcock and Singer,
   1979; Jekel, 1985). A relationship between initial concentration of
   humics and optimal coagulant dosage was often shown (Narkis and Rebhun,
   1977; Edzwald et al., 1977, 1979; Kim et al., 1989; Lefebvre and Legube,
   1990). The aim of our study was to optimize the removal of organic
   matter by iron(III) coagulation. A first set of experiments on aquatic
   humic substances allowed some results to be obtained (Lefebvre and
   Legube, 1990) such as an optimum of pH between 4.5 and 5.5 and the
   presence of the stoichiometric relationship of 2 mg Fe per mg of DOC, to
   obtain the best removal at pH 5.5.
   The objective of this paper was to try to define the role of the acidic
   function of organic matter on its removal by iron(III). Some simple
   aromatics and aliphatic acids were studied in weakly mineralized
   solution.. Experiments were carried out with laboratory apparatus
   including coagulation-flocculation sedimentation and flocculation
   treatment steps (Lefebvre and Legube, 1990). The removal of organic
   compounds was followed by TOC and u.v.-absorbance analysis. Residual
   iron was determined by atomic adsorption spectrometry.
   The optimal pH of coagulation was found to be about 5.8 for the
   salicylic acid and 5.5 for gallic acid. Figure 1 shows data obtained
   with gallic acid. Hence, the following studies were performed at pH 5.5.
   Furthermore, choice of this pH allowed comparison with results obtained
   from coagulation of fulvic acids in similar conditions (Lefebvre and
   Legube, 1990).
   Table 2 collects average values of results obtained with 17 aromatic
   compounds (2.5-15 mg l-1 TOC) coagulated at pH = 5.5 and 20-degrees-C,
   with 15, 30 or 40 mg l-1 Fe. Examination of Table 2 allows us to define
   four classes of aromatic compounds regarding their behaviour during iron
   coagulation. Aromatics bringing only one acidic group (COOH and OH) or
   more (two or three) non-adjacent acidic groups, were not removed under
   our experimental conditions (benzoic acid, p -hydroxybenzoic acid,
   m-hydroxybenzoic acid, 3-methoxybenzoic acid, o-aminobenzoic acid,
   phenol, resorcinol, phoroglucinol, o-cresol). Aromatics bringing at
   least two adjacent acidic groups were more or less removed. The type of
   acid group seemed to play a significant role on the removal yield. Two
   different groups in the ortho position led to a small removal not
   depending on the coagulant/influent TOC ratio, as shown by Fig. 2 for
   salicylic acid. Two identical groups in the ortho position induced an
   increasing removal when the coagulant/TOC(i) ratio increased. Figure 3
   illustrates this in the case of phthalic acid. Finally, two adjacent
   acidic groups on an aromatic compound led to a similar behaviour for
   humic substances (Lefebvre and Legube, 1990), that is the presence of
   optimum removal when the coagulant/TOC(i) ratio varied (gallic acid,
   pyromellitic acid and pyrogallol). Figure 4 shows an example of gallic
   acid. Figure 5 summarizes general shapes of curves in terms of remaining
   compound (TOC effluent/TOC influent) versus coagulant dose (mole/mole).
   Table 3 gives the values of the results obtained for some aliphatic
   diacids, coagulated under similar conditions (pH = 5.5, 20-degrees-C,
   TOC(i) = 2-16 mg l-1, Fe = 30 mg l-1). Figure 6 presents the synthesis.
   In the case of the saturated aliphatic, removal depended on the number
   (n) of CH2 groups between the two acidic functions. The smaller n was,
   the better the removal of diacid.
   Discussion about the possible mechanisms concludes on two main pathways.
   The first is an exchange of ligand to the surface of amorphous FeOOH.
   The second is a complexation or ligand exchange between soluble
   monomers, dimers or oligomers of iron hydroxide and organic matter to
   lead (directly or after hydrolysis) to a precipitate.}},

Abstract = {{To explore the effects of initial suspended solids concentrations and
   the nature of the suspended material on the settling behaviour (in the
   initial uniform settling region, transition zone and compression zone),
   batch settling tests were conducted for the different kinds of suspended
   materials (chemically flocculated and clay slurry types) present in
   different initial suspended solids concentrations. Using the
   experimental data, models for predicting the first-order rate constants
   for both the transition zone and compression zone were developed in
   relation to the initial suspended solids concentration and sludge volume
   index (indicating in some form, the characteristics of the suspended
   material present in the waters). The ratio of the two rate constants
   also correlated with the initial suspended solids concentration and
   sludge volume index the parameters of which also affect the minimum
   concentration for zone settling to occur. The use of the developed
   models will avoid the need of conducting enormous and time consuming
   settling tests.}},

Abstract = {{In developing countries, particularly in power-scarce locations and
   where water treatment Plants are less mechanized and have a reduced
   staff level, the baffled channels type of flocculating device continues
   to be a preferred device. The existing method of flocculating baffled
   channel design involves several trials to evaluate the flocculating
   channel dimensions to satisfy mean velocity gradient, flow velocities,
   detention time, channel configuration geometry and several other
   requirements. An integrated approach through models and nomographs has
   been presented in this paper to instantly evolve the design elements for
   such flocculating channels. The presented models and nomographs also
   provide design options for various values of the velocity in the
   channels (to suit the different floc characteristics) and for the
   different channel width to flow depth ratios. The presented methodology,
   models and nomographs add to the existing literature.}},

Abstract = {{Basic reactions, including adsorption/desorption and photodegradation,
   which influence the behaviour and fate of chelating agents in sewage
   treatment processes and in aquatic ecosystems, were evaluated for HEDP
   (1-hydroxyethane-1,1-diphosphonic acid). Freundlich constants for the
   HEDP-sorption onto clay minerals, river sediments and sewage sludges are
   mostly in the range between 500 and 3000. A remarkable desorption occurs
   only in strong acidic or higher concentrated salt solutions.
   Photodegradation is initialized in the presence of heavy metal ions
   and/or by maintaining acid pH conditions. The possibility of HEDP
   photodegradation in river waters could be verified with a special
   equipment for the simulation of terrestric solar radiation. This
   investigation supports the assumption that discharged HEDP will be able
   to accumulate and persist in the aquatic environment, if adsorption
   processes restrict the efficiency of the phosphonate photolysis.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of neuro- and hepatotoxins produced by cyanobacteria
   (blue-green algae) was assessed in eight lakes and six farm dugouts,
   located in Alberta. Anatoxin-a, an alkaloid neurotoxin produced by
   Anabaena flos-aquae, was not detected in the lake blooms with gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Algal blooms which contained
   Microcystis aeruginosa almost always had detectable concentrations of
   microcystin-LR, a peptide hepatotoxin, based on high performance liquid
   chromatography (HPLC) analyses. Bloom samples from the six farm dugouts
   contained no detectable quantity of either anatoxin-a or microcystin-LR.
   However, anatoxin-a and microcystin-LR were detected in algae isolated
   and subsequently cultured from two separate dugouts. Microcystin-RR was
   not detected in any bloom sample collected.
   Among three lakes studied in greater detail, the concentration of
   microcystin-LR present in the blooms was highly variable between lakes
   and temporally within each lake over the limited sampling period. Fast
   atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) performed on a composite of
   several bloom samples from one lake confirmed the identity of
   microcystin-LR. Bioassays were performed with a subset of the bloom
   samples to determine acute toxicity to mice. Intraperitoneal injection
   of bloom extracts containing microcystin-LR resulted in a massive
   dose-dependent pooling of blood in the liver, shock and very rapid (as
   quickly as 50 min post-injection) death of injected mice.}},

Abstract = {{An approach is presented for the least cost design of a flocculator with
   respect to flocculation time and velocity gradient, in order to obtain a
   desired effluent condition, which is measured using the negative slope
   of power law distribution function (beta). The model proposed is a
   non-linear programming problem involving a non-linear constraint, which
   in tum comprises a verified simulation model. The case study
   demonstrates the existence of a relationship between design criterion
   and design parameters. It also shows that the optimal solution is
   sensitive to influent particle size distribution (PSD) and particle
   contact efficiency (alpha).}},

Abstract = {{Two chemical accidents with insecticides in the River Rhine, i.e. the
   endosulfan accident in 1969 and the Sandoz accident in 1986, played an
   important role in public and political awareness regarding water
   pollution. The endosulfan accident gave cause for the development of a
   chemical monitoring and sanitation programme, whereas the Sandoz
   accident accelerated this sanitation programme and triggered a number of
   eco(toxico)logical studies and their implementation in water quality
   control.
   The gradual decrease in concentrations of organophosphorus insecticides
   since 1977 coincided with the recolonization of a number of insect
   species in the Lower Rhine. First some species of chironomids appeared
   and later the caddisflies Hydropsyche contubernalis followed by Ecnomus
   tenellus. Ecological research before, during and after the Sandoz
   accident showed that chironomids and caddisflies occurring in large
   numbers in the IJssel, a branch of the River Rhine, were affected by the
   Sandoz accident. After the Sandoz accident, the pattern of
   recolonization showed the same sequence. Again, various chironomid
   species were among the first to recolonize, whereas recovery of
   caddisfly populations lasted longer. It appeared that for all species no
   more than one generation was needed for recovery, whereas the second
   generation showed complete recovery.
   In general terms it means that species requiring stable conditions, e.g.
   because of their long life-cycle, will not be able to maintain
   self-sustaining populations in the Rhine where different stress factors
   are operating.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of eight mixed cultures of methane-oxidizing bacteria to
   degrade trichloroethylene (TCE) was examined in laboratory batch
   experiments. This is one of the first reported works studying TCE
   degradation by mixed cultures of methane-oxidizing bacteria at
   10-degrees-C, a common temperature for soils and groundwaters. Only
   three of the eight mixed cultures were able to degrade TCE, or to
   degrade TCE fast enough to result in a significant removal of TCE within
   the experimental time, when the cultures used methane as growth
   substrate. The same three mixed cultures were able to degrade TCE when
   they oxidized methanol, but only for a limited time period of about 5
   days. Several explanations for the discontinued degradation of TCE are
   given. An experiment carried out to re-activate the methane-oxidizing
   bacteria after 8 days of growth on methanol by adding methane did not
   immediately result in degradation of methane and TCE. During the first
   10-15 days after the addition of methane a significant degradation of
   methane and a minor degradation of TCE were observed.
   This experiment revealed that the ability of mixed cultures of
   methane-oxidizing bacteria to degrade TCE varied significantly even
   though the cultures were grown under the same conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In some cases stimulating effects-if not duly taken into
   consideration-lead to wrong toxicity assessments. In swarming inhibition
   assays, cells of Serratia marcescens showed a stimulation at low imugan
   concentrations. The fungicide cyclafuramid enhanced the swarming
   activity of Serratia marcescens Sm6 up to 10\% at a concentration of
   about 0.05 mg/l and to 20\% at 5 mg/l-thus exhibiting variations in
   swarming activity depending on the fungicide concentration. These
   phenomena were observed with different test substances and test
   organisms and seem to be caused by specific regulation processes of the
   respective microorganism.
   By using the herbicide aretit the toxic effect versus various
   physiological reactions of Serratia marcescens was comparatively
   studied. In prodigiosin synthesis and heat production stimulating
   effects could be found; swarming activity and ATP production showed a
   plateau in the activity-concentration graph. indicating stimulating
   effects as well. In contrast, growth inhibition of Serratia marcescens
   showed a normal dose-response relationship. Different reasons for the
   explanation of the stimulating phenomena are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{High suspended solids concentrations in settler effluents can be caused
   by rising sludge, which is the effect of flotation of solids by nitrogen
   gas resulting from biological denitrification. Many factors influence
   the nitrogen gas bubble evolution. The most important factor is the rate
   of biological denitrification. Factors like nitrogen gas solubility and
   oxygen concentration in settler influent only play a minor role. The
   hydraulic retention time in the bottom part of the settler is, for all
   practical purposes, so high that sufficient nitrogen gas will be
   generated at temperatures above 20-degrees-C, if the nitrate content in
   the influent to the settler is above the critical one. For temperatures
   around 20-degrees-C the critical nitrate-nitrogen concentration is 6-8 g
   NO3--N/m3. The best measure in order to avoid rising sludge is to
   denitrify the wastewater in the treatment process ahead of the settler.}},

Abstract = {{Several experiments were carried out in order to investigate the
   interactions of mercury(II) and methylmercury with microbial biofilms.
   The biofilms, mainly consisting of polysaccharides, were produced on
   glass slides in bacterial cultures spiked with different mercury
   compounds. The formation of the biofilm was determined as carbohydrate
   by the phenol-sulfuric acid method. Total mercury was measured after
   BrCl oxidation by CVAAS and methylmercury was extracted by a modified
   procedure and quantified by HPLC-u.v. Mercury(II) as well as
   methylmercury were accumulated by microbial biofilms, but no significant
   differences could be detected regarding the uptake of these compounds
   during the observation period of 2 weeks. The methylmercury content in
   the bacterial cultures declined after spiking. The reason for the
   decrease can be explained either by adsorption processes or by
   demethylation/reduction reactions followed by volatilization of produced
   Hg(O). Bioconcentration factors (BCF) for methylmercury were determined
   and are in the range 20,000-50,000. The BCF is calculated as the ratio
   of the methylmercury content in the biofilm expressed as carbohydrate
   and the actual concentration of methylmercury in the bacterial culture.}},

   little or no further dissolution, even after 1 week. The extent of Zn
   (74 +/- 8\%) dissolution was invariably greater than that of Pb (41 +/-

Abstract = {{In an experiment extending over approx. 3 months, brown trout (Salmo
   trutta) were exposed to dilutions of biologically-treated wastewater
   (13, 24 and 42\%) from a large sewage plant. The two higher
   concentrations caused a sequence of histological changes in the kidney
   and, after some delay, in the liver as well. No effects were detectable
   in the gills however. In all dilutions of the biologically-treated
   sewage, external injury of the fish was rapidly followed by fungal
   infection. Furthermore, kidney changes similar to those seen in the
   experiment were also observed in brown trout and rainbow trout
   (Oncorhynchus mykiss) caught downstream of the point at which the
   treated effluents from the sewage plant entered the River Inn. The
   pathogenic effects of ammonia and nitrite in the treated sewage are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of phosphate in soils is both concentration and time
   dependent. An expression for the mobility of phosphate in a soil should
   follow from substitution of an equation for the adsorption of phosphate
   into a mass balance equation for movement of phosphate. Substitution is
   only allowed if the time frames of the (static) adsorption equation and
   the (dynamic) mass balance equation are compatible. This is not the
   case, however.
   Incompatibility of time frames is avoided in this paper by basing
   adsorption and mass flow processes in a soil on the minimum time for
   dispersive mixing. This time is determined by the dispersion length,
   which is the change in longitudinal dispersive spread (variance) of a
   solute per unit depth of soil. The average adsorption, as seen by the
   moving front of a step increase in the concentration of phosphate in a
   soil, is found by substituting the time for longitudinal dispersive
   mixing into the adsorption equation for phosphate. Mobilities and travel
   times in soils are then calculated from this average adsorption.
   Applying this method to soils at a disposal site for wastewater from a
   sewage treatment plant in Albany, Western Australia, travel times of
   phosphate to deep groundwater are calculated to be at least 500 years
   and very likely to be of the order of 1000 years or more.
   Disposal of wastewater in soil makes conditions favourable for
   precipitation of phosphate in calcium phosphates. Theoretically >95\% of
   phosphate from wastewater can be stored in the soil as hydroxyapatite
   and fluoroapatite.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted in a greenhouse to determine the phytotoxic
   effect and uptake capacity of Zn, Cr and Cd by the water hyacinth
   Eichhornia crassipes. Results show that among the three elements tested,
   Cd was the most phytotoxic, showing up some necrosis in the plant when
   the concentration was greater than 2.5 ppm. In the case of Cr and Zn,
   the phytotoxicity produced the appearance of chlorosis in the aerial
   part of the plant. For the tested rates of Cr (maximum 9 ppm) no
   reduction of productivity was found, whereas in the case of Zn the
   concentration of 9 ppm in solution caused a 30\% reduction in the
   weight. As for the heavy metal absorption, it was proved that after 24
   days of growth, the heavy metals were totally depleted from the
   nutritive solution suggesting complete absorption of these metals by the
   plants.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{277-291}},

Abstract = {{A model is developed to describe the leaching of major soluble
   inorganics (the sulphate and chloride salts of calcium, magnesium,
   sodium and potassium) from processed oil shale sourced from the Rundle
   resource, Queensland, Australia. The model accounts for rapid
   dissolution of readily soluble salts, the formation of non-charged ion
   pairs in solution, cation exchange and slow dissolution/precipitation of
   calcium sulphate (anhydrite/gypsum).
   Leachate results from an experiment involving irrigation of an initially
   dry column of processed shale are used to validate the model. A piston
   model is used to account for unsaturated water flow, and this is
   expressed in the water quality model by a moving bottom boundary
   condition. Tracer experiments show that a good basis for the leaching
   model is the classic convection-dispersion model. A moving node finite
   element method is used to obtain a numerical solution to this leaching
   model. The model provides a good description of the leaching of each
   inorganic species. Deviations between model predictions and experimental
   results are greatest at slower flowrates and for monovalent cations. It
   is concluded that the main chemical mechanisms controlling leaching of
   major inorganics from processed shale have been identified.}},

Abstract = {{Rainjars are popular in northeast Thailand because of the time and
   effort saved in water collection resulting from their use.
   Bacteriological analysis showed rainjar water to be much purer than
   drinking water from alternative sources (P < 0.001). In rainwater
   samples from one village, Escherichia coli was absent in 60\% of
   rainjars compared with 46\% of other vessels used for storing drinking
   water in the home (P < 0.01). The use of a tap and the physical height
   of the jar served to protect the water by limiting water handling.
   Moreover, mosquito netting fitted to the top of the rainjar
   significantly improved its water quality (P < 0.05), probably by
   preventing the access of small lizards. It is suggested that any
   systematic attempt to improve the quality of rainjar water further, in
   order to achieve the WHO guidelines, would be both problematic and
   expensive whilst the expected health benefits remain negligible. The
   problems of using drinking water quality guidelines for discrete
   supplies and the role of water analysis are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{There is a need for developing low cost, easily and abundantly
   available, yet efficient, adsorbents for the removal of phosphates
   during the tertiary treatment of wastewaters. The tamarind nut shell
   activated carbon (TNSAC) prepared on a laboratory scale has been used to
   evaluate its performance for phosphate adsorption. This paper describes
   the laboratory production of this adsorbent material in its various
   forms, and discusses the effects of the TNSAC process variables (the
   unrinsed and rinsed forms of the TNSAC and the impregnation ratio) on
   its performance in adsorbing phosphate. The material has been shown to
   be a good alternative adsorbent. As much as 95\% phosphate removal by
   the unrinsed TNSAC is possible in about 30 min under the test
   conditions. The phosphate adsorbing capacity is about two times higher
   for the unrinsed TNSAC in comparison to the rinsed TNSAC. The adsorption
   rates, however, transit to extremely low rates towards the end when
   equilibrium conditions could be attained in about 2 h contact time. The
   phosphate removal mechanics are adsorption and precipitation/ion
   exchange when unrinsed TNSAC is used, and adsorption alone for the
   rinsed TNSAC. The maximum phosphate removal is found to take place at an
   impregnation ratio of 10 for both forms of the TNSAC.}},

Abstract = {{The phosphate removal potential of a low cost and abundantly available
   material, tamarind nut shell activated carbon (TNSAC) was investigated.
   A previous paper of ours has described the laboratory scale production
   of this material and the effects of the process variables (unrinsed and
   rinsed forms of the TNSAC and the impregnation ratio) on its performance
   in adsorbing phosphates. This paper discusses the effects of operating
   variables (adsorbent particles size, initial adsorbate concentration,
   adsorbent dose and contact time duration) on the phosphate adsorption by
   the TNSAC. Phosphate removal is seen to increase with increasing
   adsorbent doses, decreasing adsorbent particle size and increasing
   ratios of initial phosphate concentration to adsorbent dose. The
   unrinsed TNSAC provides higher phosphate removal in comparison to the
   rinsed TNSAC. The maximum difference in the effectiveness of the
   unrinsed and rinsed TNSAC is seen to occur at an adsorbent dose of 2 g
   l-1 under the test conditions. The lowest equilibrium phosphate
   concentration is attained at an impregnation ratio of 1.0. Models for
   predicting phosphate removal have been evolved. These models also
   incorporate operational variables such as the adsorbent particle size,
   initial adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose, contact time etc., and
   manifest high values of the correlation coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{The studies related to the phosphate removal potential of a laboratory
   scale produced adsorbent, the tamarind nut shell activated carbon
   (TNSAC), have been partly reported in two papers by us which described
   the production of the various TNSAC forms, and the effects of the
   process variables (unrinsed and rinsed TNSAC forms and the impregnation
   ratio) and of the operational variables (adsorbent particle size,
   initial adsorbate concentration, adsorbent dose and contact time
   duration) on the performance evaluation of the TNSAC in adsorbing
   phosphates. The performance predictive models were also presented. This
   paper discusses the adsorption isotherm relationships and models. The
   applicability of the system to real field situations, and the reuse
   possibility and removal of the phosphate loaded adsorbent particles,
   have also been brought out in this paper. The isotherm plots show higher
   phosphate adsorptive capacity for greater equilibrium concentration
   values. The highest adsorptive capacity results at an impregnation ratio
   of 1.0 for both forms of the TNSAC and at all adsorbent doses. The
   adsorptive capacity is higher for the unrinsed TNSAC in comparison to
   the rinsed TNSAC, corresponding to the same equilibrium concentration.
   The rinsed TNSAC yields an isotherm model similar to the Freudlich
   isotherm. The unrinsed TNSAC does not yield any conventional isotherm
   forms, yet they have been modelled. Generalized models for predicting
   the adsorptive capacity have been evolved, and such models also
   incorporate the impregnation ratio, and the term for the adsorbent
   particle size. The models have indicated high correlation coefficients.
   When present in wastewaters, the adsorption of phosphates on the TNSAC
   is seen to reduce due to the preferential adsorption of other pollutants
   present in the wastewaters. The spent and phosphate loaded TNSAC
   particles are seen to be removable. Physical adsorption is seen to be
   the predominantly likely mechanism of phosphate adsorption on the TNSAC,
   which suggests the reuse possibility of the TNSAC.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic pathway of the phenol degradation in Pseudomonas putida BH
   was amplified by introducing the recombinant plasmid pBH500 containing
   catechol-2,3-oxygenase gene isolated from the chromosome of P. putida
   BH. This genetically engineered microorganism (GEM) was designated P.
   putida BH (pBH500). The experimental results showed that it could
   degrade phenol and grow much faster than the wild strain at the phenol
   concentration of 100 mg/l. However, at the phenol concentration of
   200-400 mg/l, the effective phenol degradation by the amplification of
   gene expression was not shown clearly. The concentration of xenobiotic
   compounds which are contained in actual wastewater is relatively low.
   Therefore, the results manifested that the GEM could accelerate the
   phenol removal rate if it was applied to the treatment of wastewater
   containing phenol.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of chloroform and trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation by
   the methanotroph, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, were measured in
   batch kinetic experiments. The experiments focused on initial
   concentrations of around 100 mug/l for chloroform and around 1 mg/l for
   TCE. The pseudo first-order rate constants ranged from 0.2 to 0.4 l/mg
   TSS-day for chloroform and from 0.5 to 3.3 l/mg TSS-day for TCE in the
   absence of methane. Comparison of the TCE rate constants to other work
   indicates that the organisms were producing the soluble form of their
   methane monooxygenase. The presence of methane caused significant enzyme
   competition at methane concentrations as low as 0.35 mg/l, resulting in
   smaller chloroform rate constants. The decreases in the rate constant
   were consistent with the predictions of an enzyme competitive inhibition
   model, which indicated a half saturation coefficient for methane in the
   order of 0.3 mg/l. The predominant degradation products from chloroform
   was carbon dioxide.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of anaerobic granules and their EPS was investigated
   when the granules were exposed to long term depletion of selected heavy
   metals (Ni, Co and Fe) in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB)
   reactors.
   Experiments were performed in five reactors (R1-R5). Granules in
   reactors were operated at the following conditions: (1) fed with
   volatile fatty acids supplemented with yeast extract for over 200 days,
   (2) the same feed, but without yeast extract, for 60 days and (3) no
   feeding but upflow liquid recirculation for 30 days. Feed for each
   reactor was supplemented with different concentrations of Ni, Co and Fe.
   Supplements of Ni, Co and Fe in the feed did not influence the COD
   conversion in the reactors for 200 days. However, when yeast extract was
   eliminated from the feed, COD conversion decreased significantly after
   60 days in these reactors which were not supplemented with iron. Amount
   of carbohydrates extracted from granules was affected by iron and yeast
   extract. A good relationship was found between the extracted
   carbohydrates and specific activity of bacteria. Most of the iron and
   cobalt in extracted EPS were found in bound form, which may be important
   in bacterial aggregation. The polysaccharides in EPS contained mainly
   pentoses and hexoses.}},

Abstract = {{Batch, pilot and full-scale dissolved air flotation (DAF) tests were
   performed on a eutrophic water source to determine suitable physical and
   chemical (coagulation) conditions for the removal of trihalomethane
   precursors (THMP). The key parameters were identified as inorganic
   coagulant dose, pH control and possibly polymer addition. Factorial
   experiments on the pilot plant showed that 150 mg/l ferric chloride
   addition and a pH of 5 would be appropriate; the need for polymer
   addition was dubious. Under these conditions, it was possible to reduce
   total (unfiltered) trihalomethane concentrations by over 80\% to below
   0.1 mg/l. When a full-scale DAF plant was operated under the conditions
   suggested by the pilot plant, THM reductions were not as dramatic,
   probably due to poorer chemical mixing conditions. An analysis of
   various raw water quality parameters suggested that algae were
   responsible for a significant proportion of the precursor concentration.
   Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was found to be a poor indicator of THMP
   concentration; furthermore, these THMPs were selectively removed from
   the overall DOC pool during the coagulation/DAF treatment process.}},

Abstract = {{A method is developed to correlate activated sludge response variables,
   such as SVI, effluent volatile suspended solids or effluent BOD, with
   state variables such as F/M ratio, influent BOD, dynamic sludge age,
   etc. The method is based on multiple linear regression with
   autocorrelated errors. The method was applied to three data sets from
   two full-scale activated sludge plants; one a regional municipal
   utility, the other an industrial facility. Highly statistically
   significant models were found which could explain 65-82\% of the
   variability in effluent total oxygen demand, 22-60\% in effluent
   volatile suspended solids and 48-88\% in sludge volume index. It was
   only necessary to model up to second order lags. The models were tested
   for bias using different data sets and produced correlation coefficients
   between predicted and observed values as high as 0.96. These results
   show that useful predictive relationships can be developed for
   full-scale activated sludge processes. The methods could be used to
   develop a range of automatic process control schemes.}},

Abstract = {{During a study of the dynamics of sediment nitrogen, phosphorus (P) and
   organic matter in rivers, a common method for analysis of soil P
   differentiating between total phosphorus (TP), inorganic phosphorus
   (P(i)) and organic phosphorus (P(o) = TP - P(i)) revealed serious
   errors. Negative values of P(o) were calculated in approx. 40\% of 420
   river sediment samples and the reproducibility was low. The method
   involved a mild extraction from 2 mm wet-sieved samples, respectively
   ignited (550-degrees-C for 2h) and unignited, by shaking for 2 h at room
   temperature with 0.1 M H2SO4.
   The poor reproducibility of the initial method was greatly improved by
   grinding the dried sediment to < 250 mum. Even better results were
   obtained by also changing to stronger extractants (1 M HCl and 7.7 M
   HCl) and by boiling for 20 min. The combined effect of grinding and
   changing extractant yielded approx. 30\% more P(i) and up to 44\% more
   TP, and good reproducibility was achieved. Further, the number of
   negative P(o) values has reduced to 8\%. Analysing sediment P in 1094
   sub-samples. in 282 iron-poor samples only 5\% of the P(o) values were
   negative, and in 812 iron-rich samples 10\% of the P(o) values became
   negative. About 75\% of the negative P(o)-values were associated with
   very low organic contents (< 0.6\% loss on ignition).
   We conclude, that extraction involving 1 M HCl can be recommended for
   routine determinations of TP and P(i) in river sediments, and to
   determine P(o) when TP-P(i) > 10 mg P kg-1 dw For very iron-rich
   sediment, however, some reservation still must be made due to some
   interference, possibly arising during the ignition phase.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of Legionella in water of 30 cooling tower systems was
   studied, as well as the relationship of its occurrence with the
   physical, chemical and microbiological characteristics of the waters.
   The samples were concentrated by membrane filtration and one part of the
   concentrate was acid washed. Three types of culture media, MWY, CCVC and
   BCYEalpha were used. Fourteen (47\%) of the cooling systems were
   Legionella-positive. Numbers of Legionella in the positive systems
   varied between 50 and 490,000 cfu/l. Legionella pneumophila was the
   dominant isolate, and the serogroups 6 and 1 were the commonest ones.
   There was no statistically significant difference in mean water
   temperature between the Legionella-positive (27-degrees-C) and -negative
   (24-degrees-C) systems. The total number of bacteria (AODC) was lower in
   the Legionella-positive than in the negative systems. Also the nutrient
   concentrations were generally lower in the Legionella-positive cooling
   systems. The results suggest that different factors regulate the
   occurrence of Legionella than that of overall bacterial populations in
   the cooling tower systems.}},

Abstract = {{A laboratory scale study was conducted to assess the feasibility of a
   modified rotating biological contactor (RBC) with polyurethane foam
   (PUF) attached to the disks as porous support media to biodegrade a
   petroleum refinery wastewater. PUF of 1 cm thickness was attached to
   both sides of each disk. Two parallel RBC-PUF units (each having 24.8 l.
   working volume) were operated simultaneously at different hydraulic
   loading rates 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04 m3/(m.d) and at a rotational
   speed of 10 rpm. For all hydraulic loadings studied, the removal
   efficiency of the total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) and oil were above
   87 and 80\%, respectively. Ammonia nitrogen and phenol removal were
   above 99 and 85\%, respectively. The biomass concentration within the
   RBC-PUF system was also investigated. The efficiency of the RBC-PUF
   system for the treatment (removal of organics, ammonia nitrogen, phenol,
   oil and grease and suspended solids) of the petroleum refinery
   wastewater at various hydraulic loadings was investigated. The results
   obtained in terms of biodegradation of COD, NH3-N, phenol, hydrocarbons
   and suspended solids in the modified RBC were generally better than a
   conventional RBC.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial leaching is one of the advantageous methods of removing heavy
   metals from sewage sludge, however, the microbiological aspects of this
   technology have not been studied. This study presents the
   characterization of the naturally occurring microorganisms, responsible
   for the metal leaching activity, in 21 different sewage sludges. The
   results obtained indicate that the bioleaching of metals is carried out
   by successive growth of less-acidophilic and acidophilic thiobacilli.
   Several species of less-acidophilic thiobacilli participate in the
   sludge acidification, but Thiobacillus thioparus is the most important
   species. In contrast, Thiobacillus thiooxidans seems to be the only
   species involved in the acidophilic group of thiobacilli. The growth
   kinetics of the two groups of thiobaciili was followed in five different
   sewage sludges. After 5 days of incubation in shake flasks, the pH of
   the sludge was decreased to about 2.0 and this pH decrease solubilized
   the toxic metals (Cd: 83-90\%; Cr: 19-41\%; Cu: 69-92\%; Mn: 88-99\%;
   Ni: 77-88\%; Pb: 10-54\%; Zn: 88-97\%). The maximum specific growth rate
   (mu(max)) for the less-acidophilic thiobacilli varied between 0.079 and
   0.104 h-1 and that for the acidophilic thiobacilli varied between 0.067
   and 0.079 h-1.}},

Abstract = {{The biological leaching of heavy metals from sewage sludge with ferrous
   iron and elemental sulfur as substrate was investigated in shake flask
   experiments. The tests were performed at six different temperatures in
   the range of 7-42-degrees-C. The temperature effects on the kinetics of
   metal solubilization with the two bioleaching processes (ferrous iron
   and sulfur) followed first-order kinetics for cadmium, copper, nickel
   and zinc. The activation energies calculated from the rate constants
   varied between 30 and 64 kJ/mol, whereas the temperature coefficients
   (Q10) in the 7-28-degrees-C range, were evaluated as 1.6 and 2.5. The
   temperature effects on bacterial growth (less-acidophilic and
   acidophilic thiobacilli) were measured in the bioleaching process with
   sulfur. The growth rate constants of the two types of thiobacilli
   yielded a linear Arrhenius plot, an activation energy of 42 kJ/mol and a
   temperature coefficient (Q10) of 1.8 for the 7-28-degrees-C temperature
   interval. These results suggested that the growth of leaching bacteria
   was the rate-limiting step for metal solubilization from the sludge, and
   that the metal removal from sludge by biological methods was strongly
   influenced by the temperature of the bioreaction. However, the metal
   leaching tests carried out in this study, showed that the two biological
   processes can be used for sludge decontamination at very low
   temperatures (7-degrees-C)}},

Abstract = {{Plastic materials are often used in experimental and sampling equipment.
   Plastics are not gas tight, since gases are able to diffuse through the
   walls of tubing and containers made of plastic. Methods for calculating
   the significance of gas diffusion through the walls of containers and
   the walls of tubings for both turbulent and laminar flow conditions is
   presented. A more complex model for diffusion under laminar flow
   conditions is developed. A comprehensive review on gas diffusion
   coefficients for the main gases (O2, N2, CO2, CH4 etc.) and for a long
   range of plastic materials is also presented. Calculations show that
   diffusion of oxygen through plastic tubing and reactors into anoxic
   water can be a serious problem for a series of plastic materials.
   Comparison of the method for turbulent and laminar flow in tubings shows
   that the difference is insignificant for most cases. Calculations show
   also that the use of silicone rubber in experimental and sampling
   equipment to be used for anoxic water is, for most cases, prohibited by
   oxygen diffusion.}},

   acidification. Most chemical variance was related to the nature of the
   bedrock. Lakes on Devonian, Cambro-Ordovician, Silurian or granodioritic
   batholites were easily distinguished. Even between different batholites,
   there were significant differences. There was no clear distinction
   either in the chemistry or in trophic status between disturbed and

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out on secondary effluents under different
   conditions of light and temperature with the aim of evaluating the
   potential and limits of the epilithic filamentous cyanobacterium
   Phormidium bohneri (Schmidle) for biotreatment of domestic wastewaters.
   Aerated cultures were incubated at 10 and 30-degrees-C in a chamber
   fitted with a photic gradient plate receiving 120 and 720 muE/m2 s.
   Results indicate that the strain used prefers elevated temperatures, and
   can withstand considerable variation in light intensity. Response at
   30-degrees-C with regard to NH3 and PO4-3 removal agrees with that
   reported for unicellular chlorophytes. A complete exhaustion of these
   nutrients was obtained after 3 and 5 days, respectively. It appears that
   NH3 stripping contributed substantially (38-100\%) to the overall NH3
   removal efficiency observed in the system. In addition, the protein and
   carbohydrate content of the biomass produced suggests potential
   feedstock use.}},

Abstract = {{Alkalinity or buffering in anaerobic digesters may be chiefly attributed
   to bicarbonate and should be at least 1000 mg CaCO3/l for successful
   operation. A simple on-line instrument for the direct determination of
   bicarbonate concentration, especially for automatic control of anaerobic
   digesters, is described. The proposed method is based on a continuous
   measurement of the carbon dioxide flow rate evolved from a stream of
   sampled solution after saturation with gaseous CO2 and subsequent
   acidification with excess acid. This eliminates the need for a pH probe
   which is subject to fouling.
   The device was calibrated using sodium bicarbonate solutions (0.01-0.065
   M) and the calibration showed an accuracy of +/-5\%. The device was
   tested on effluent from anaerobic digesters operating on ice-cream waste
   supplemented with sodium bicarbonate within a range of 0.02-0.04 mol/l.
   The results compared favourably with titrimetric measurements,
   extensively used to determine bicarbonate alkalinity with an accuracy of
   +/-5\%. The response of the instrument to variation in alkalinity
   concentration is sufficiently rapid for most industrial applications.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid physical-chemical method has been developed for the
   determination of the readily biodegradable portion of influent soluble
   COD. The method involves removal by flocculation and precipitation of
   colloidal matter that normally passes through 0.45 mum membrane filters.
   Results from four domestic wastewaters demonstrated that the
   physical-chemical method and the biological method (Ekama et al., 1984)
   gave virtually identical results. The physical-chemical method was used
   successfully to measure the quantity of truly soluble organic matter
   removed in the anaerobic zone of bench-scale enhanced biological
   phosphorus removal activated sludge systems.}},
