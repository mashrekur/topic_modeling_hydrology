Abstract = {{Due to the large and often competing demands for water and increasing
   importance of sustainability criteria, water resource managers have
   begun to examine closely ways in which the operation of existing and
   planned reservoirs could be optimised. Guidelines have been devised on
   the operation of multi-purpose, multiple reservoir water systems, but
   there remains no methodology generally accepted by water resource
   managers for deriving multiple-reservoir operating policies. This
   article proposes a new approach to the optimisation of the operation of
   multiple reservoir systems. The revised methodology develops the concept
   of an extended drought period to evaluate additional emergency storage
   reserve extending the reliability of the system. The operation of the
   Roadford Reservoir System, SouthWest England, consisting of nine
   reservoirs was studied. Through simulation analysis, the control rules
   for each reservoir were revised based on the concept of minimising
   demand deficit. This article highlights the superior results compared
   with the current operating control rules.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, attention is initially focussed on modelling finely
   sampled ( 1 min) residential water demand time series. Subsequently, the
   possibility of simulating the water demand time series relevant to
   different time intervals and many users is analysed by using an
   aggregation approach. A cluster Neyman-Scott stochastic process (NSRP)
   is proposed to represent the residential water demand and a
   parameterisation procedure is implemented to respect the cyclical
   behaviour usually observed in any working day. A validation is performed
   on the basis of the one-minute data collected on the water distribution
   system of Castelfranco Emilia located in the province of Modena ( I).
   The elaborations performed show the validity both of the NSRP model and
   the parameterisation procedure proposed to represent the residential
   demand with fine time intervals ( up to 5 - 10 min). On the other hand,
   when a procedure of aggregation is applied to represent the water demand
   of a high number of users, the results are no longer satisfactory since
   only the mean is preserved while the other statistics, and in particular
   the variance, are underestimated.}},

Abstract = {{Kastoria Lake is located in northwestern Greece. The whole basin of the
   lake is about 253 km(2). For the computation of the surface water volume
   inflowing into the lake from the main streams of the sub-basins located
   around Kastoria Lake, a rainfall-runoff sub-model is used. A
   quasi-three-dimensional simulation model of the Kastoria basin aquifer
   is also realized, in order to estimate the groundwater contribution to
   the volumetric budget of the lake and the whole basin as well. For the
   computation of sediment load inflowing into the lake from the main
   streams of the sub-basins, the rainfall-runoff sub-model is combined
   with a soil erosion sub-model and a sediment transport sub-model for
   streams. A GIS was developed in the hydrologic basin with all data
   needed for parameter identification and model application. The data base
   was enriched by a series of on site measurements of water discharge made
   in all main streams for one whole hydrologic year. By means of the
   resulting mathematical sediment model, those sub-basins, which deliver
   most sediment load to the lake, are identified. On the basis of this
   identification, a series of control measures, for the reduction of
   sediment inflowing into the lake, at certain places of the above
   mentioned sub-basins is proposed.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{89-111}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Metering water consumption has been long advocated by economists in
   developing countries as a way to curb waste and prevent resource
   depletion. However, very few of these economists have studied the
   inefficiencies brought about by universal metering or the conditions
   under which decentralized water metering decisions are optimal. If the
   decision where to install water meters rests on either the consumer or
   the Company providing the service this article shows that if left
   unregulated, both the consumer's and the Company's decentralized water
   metering decisions are sub-optimal. This is because the firm when
   installing meters, does not take into account the fall in consumer
   surplus and the consumer, when voluntarily installing a meter in his
   dwelling, does not take into account the effect of his decision on the
   Company's profits. To solve this externality problem and make the
   decentralized decision optimal, an incentive mechanism is proposed. The
   mechanism works through a series of Pigouvian taxes imposed by the
   regulator on the party creating the externality. By means of these
   taxes, externalities are internalized and both the consumer and the
   Company reach the socially optimal solution in a decentralized way. The
   implementation of this mechanism in practice is materialized through a
   Coasian property rights approach where the parties involved reach the
   efficient solution by bargaining over welfare gains. The party
   installing the meter has to buy the `right to meter' from the metered
   party by fairly compensating him thus internalizing the externality and
   reaching the efficient outcome. To illustrate the incentives involved in
   metering water consumption, the rate structure and metering policies of
   two water concessions in Argentina are studied: Buenos Aires and
   Cordoba. Conclusions and policy recommendations are drawn from the
   theory and the two practical cases.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Alluvial channels undergo continuous morphological changes caused by
   relationships between entrained sediment, variable flows and movable
   boundaries. Excess changes that occur through sediment degradation and
   deposition, however, tend to threaten the stability of bridges,
   hydraulic control structures and underground utilities. These changes
   also reduce conveyance capacity of a channel and diminish reservoir
   benefits associated with hydropower generation, flood control, and water
   supply. This article outlines the development of an optimal control
   methodology for minimizing sediment aggradation and degradation, thus
   controlling channel bed morphology, in large-scale multi-reservoir river
   systems. The sedimentation control problem is solved by coupling the U.
   S. Army Corps of Engineer's HEC-6 sediment transport simulation model
   with an immune genetic algorithm. The simulation model is used to
   implicitly solve governing hydraulic and sediment constraints, while the
   genetic algorithm is used to solve the overall control problem. The
   method is demonstrated first through application to a hypothetical river
   network from the literature, for which a comparison between the genetic
   algorithm and alternative optimization technique is made. A second
   application to an existing hydraulic network illustrates the practical
   utility of the methodology as a decision-making tool for sedimentation
   control.}},

Abstract = {{A simplification for the variable sorptivity infiltration equation of
   Poulovassilis et al. (1989) is proposed. The resulting equation has
   three parameters S-x, c and K-0. From these, S-x and c are considered as
   fitting parameters and K0 as a physical one. The new empirical
   infiltration equation is tested for precision, parameter time-dependence
   and applicability for soil surveys. The test was carried out by
   comparison with reference solutions i.e. infiltration data obtained
   experimentally, analytically or numerically for two different head
   conditions at the infiltration surface. A good agreement is observed for
   all examined cases. The dependence of the fitting parameters Sx and c on
   the initial and boundary conditions, as well as the error that arises by
   taking into account different values of them, are examined. In fine
   textured soils parameter c seems to be very small, so that one can
   easily suppose that the proposed equation reduces to the well-known
   Philip's infiltration equation ( Philip, 1957).}},

Abstract = {{An approach is presented to satisfy the demand for simple criteria,
   guidelines and models for the preliminary sizing of horizontal
   subsurface flow ( SF) constructed wetland systems. This approach
   eliminates time-consuming calculations and iterations by providing
   graphical solutions for wetland system sizing. Therefore, it can be used
   for the preliminary assessment of new or performance evaluation of
   existing subsurface flow constructed wetland systems. The validity of
   this methodology is checked with data from existing systems and is found
   to be quite satisfactory. This methodology is combined with simple
   equations predicting the maximum wetland capacity in summer, so as to
   assist designers in sizing installations in tourist areas with increased
   summer populations. Furthermore, based on this methodology, a
   sensitivity analysis is performed of the area requirements for
   wastewaters of various strengths and various design conditions and
   performance criteria. The results provide a useful overview to engineers
   and further simplify the design methodology of new subsurface flow
   constructed wetland systems.}},

Abstract = {{A team of specialists normally carries out the task of locating
   reservoir sites based on general guidelines, technical knowledge and
   experience. Consequently, the procedures used are not based on a defined
   criteria in addition to being time consuming and expensive. Furthermore,
   the failure of a number of dams and the increase in environmental
   awareness will require the inclusion of environmental and social factors
   in the processes besides economy. In this study, a criteria was
   developed and implemented to locate potential sites for reservoirs in
   the Langkawi Island, Malaysia based on all relevant factors including:
   topography, geology, hydrology, land use/cover types and settlements. A
   satellite imagery and digitized geological and elevation maps were
   utilized to generate the necessary data layers for the developed
   criteria. Then IDRISI, a raster based GIS was employed to implement the
   criteria using the Boolean and the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC)
   methods. The Boolean method produced five reservoir sites with the 70
   Mld water capacity, two of which corresponded well with a field-based
   study. Whilst the proposed site with the 90 Mld water capacity did not
   correspond with the field based study. The WLC method produced five
   sites with the 70 Mld water capacity, three of which matched those of
   the field study. Whilst for the 90 Mld water requirement, two potential
   sites were produced and both have matched those of the field study. The
   outcomes indicated that the developed criteria were sensitive to
   physical, environmental and economical settings on the Langkawi Island.
   Furthermore, GIS and remote sensing can be useful tools for generating,
   manipulating and handling relevant data layers and ultimately providing
   management options for decision makers.}},

Abstract = {{Kotychi lagoon, located at the northwestern coast of Peloponnese,
   Greece, is a biotope of great ecological and financial importance,
   protected by the Ramsar International Convention. Kotychi lagoon has
   been severely degraded and transformed during the past 50 years, due to
   agricultural activities in the surrounding areas and watercourse
   alterations after the construction of Pinios river dam in the late 60's.
   Restoration works (dredging of a hibernation basin and five radial
   submerged channels) in the period 1989-1992, resulted in the improvement
   of the lagoon conditions and provided better conditions for the
   protection of the ecosystem. In this article, a Geographical Information
   System has been developed to quantify and spatially characterize the
   temporal changes on lagoon morphology and surface area for the period
   from 1945 to 1993. The vector database model of the ARC/INFO has
   enhanced for the handling the temporal changes of the spatial data.
   Spatial and thematic information concerning the surface area,
   topography, and the major cover types of the lagoon for years 1945,
   1960, 1987 and 1993 was obtained from aerial photographs and land
   surveys of the area, and was stored in the GIS database. From the
   spatio-temporal analysis of the stored data, using as a reference
   surface the lagoon surface at the year 1945, the following conclusions
   can be drawn. A permanent decrease of the water surface of the lagoon
   has been observed between the years 1945 and 1987 (from 97.8 to 40.3\%
   of the lagoon reference surface). In 1987 the surface of the lagoon
   covered by land or swampy areas reached its maximum (59.7\% of the
   reference surface), while in 1993, after the restoration works, the
   water surface reached the 48.4\% while the land and swampy areas
   decreased to 51.6\% of the reference surface.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the effects of tidal fluctuations on groundwater
   in the Konan groundwater basin of Japan and the methodology for
   estimating aquifer parameters by the tidal response technique. The field
   investigation revealed that the two wells (H-5 and I-2) near the
   coastline are significantly affected by seawater intrusion, and the
   water quality is not suitable for most beneficial uses. The tidal cycle
   further aggravates the groundwater contamination by seawater intrusion
   into the basin. Using the tidal response model, the aquifer hydraulic
   conductivity (K) at these two sites is estimated to be 4.5 x 10(-3) and
   5.1 x 10(-3) m s(-1), respectively. It was also indicated by the inverse
   modeling that the tidal fluctuations affect the study area up to about 1
   km from the coastline. Further, the tidal efficiency was determined in
   the range of 20 to 21\% at Site I-2 and 38 to 41\% at Site H-5. The
   estimates of the storage coefficient (S) based on the time lag equation
   were not found reliable for the phreatic aquifer. However, the tidal
   efficiency-factor equation yielded reliable S estimates in this study.
   Finally, it is concluded that the tidal response technique is effective
   and reliable for estimating aquifer parameters in the coastal region,
   and that the Konan basin must be managed judiciously to ensure
   sustainable utilization of its vital groundwater resources.}},

Abstract = {{A modern real time flood forecasting system requires its mathematical
   model(s) to handle highly complex rainfall runoff processes. Uncertainty
   in real time flood forecasting will involve a variety of components such
   as measurement noise from telemetry systems, inadequacy of the models,
   insufficiency of catchment conditions, etc. Probabilistic forecasting is
   becoming more and more important in this field. This article describes a
   novel attempt to use a Fuzzy Logic approach for river flow modelling
   based on fuzzy decision trees. These trees are learnt from data using
   the MA-ID3 algorithm. This is an extension of Quinlan's ID3 and is based
   on mass assignments. MA-ID3 allows for the incorporation of fuzzy
   attribute and class values into decision trees aiding generalisation and
   providing a framework for representing linguistic rules. The article
   showed that with only five fuzzy labels, the FDT model performed
   reasonably well and a comparison with a Neural Network model (Back
   Propagation) was carried out. Furthermore, the FDT model indicated that
   the rainfall values of four or five days before the prediction time are
   regarded as more informative to the prediction than the more recent
   ones. Although its performance is not as good as the neural network
   model in the test case, its glass box nature could provide some useful
   insight about the hydrological processes.}},

   ranging from those that use a simple model such as USLE to others of a

   different methods can be combined in order to design a knowledge

   space-time variability of both composition and structure of a pattern.
   Case studies, tools and prototype implementations are described for
   illustrating how both KDD and GeoVis methods can be applied to
   uncovering spatio-temporal patterns. Finally, the specific underlying

Abstract = {{Natural or induced floods are of increasing concern to water managers
   and civil protection services for three main reasons. Firstly, a
   continuous and `unconscious' increase of social pressure in the flooding
   valleys amplifies flood vulnerabilities and consequently natural or
   induced flood risk. Secondly, the alarming forecasts of the impact of
   potential climate changes on water resources, in spite of the high
   uncertainty associated to these forecasts, points out to larger flood
   hazards. Thirdly, dam-break induced accidents may occur more frequently
   due to infrastructure aging. Emergency Planning is a non-structural
   measure to minimise flood impacts playing an important role in crisis
   management. In fact, if a disaster cannot be avoided, individual and
   social structure preparedness may be of great help in risk reduction. An
   Internet-based system that supports flood emergency management is
   presented in this article. This application is part of a more complete
   system, developed with the goal of endowing the Portuguese water
   authorities, dam owners and the civil protection system, with adequate
   tools to store and easily retrieve information on dams and their
   downstream valleys, to model the flood wave induced by a dam break and,
   eventually, to manage the response to flood-induced catastrophes.}},

   proposed in order to establish the HRZ in karstic aquifers: including
   several general strategies for the protection of the ground waters
   within them, as well as the zoning of the land use and the development
   of a code of practice. A general procedure is proposed for the
   development of code of practice for ground water protection in karst

Abstract = {{Groundwater modelling is hindered by the lack of adequate information
   about the groundwater system and hence the need for an interactive and
   efficient system for data preparation and results analysis. Such a lack
   of information usually necessitates the use of tedious iterative
   methodology within a sensitivity analysis scheme. The heterogeneous
   aquifer systems complicate the issue since more data is required to
   simulate the system. This study demonstrates the integrated approach to
   bridge the gap between data handling and modelling. The karst cretaceous
   aquifer system (complex aquifer system) of the Eastern Basin in the West
   Bank is used to illustrate this approach. The groundwater modelling
   approach integrates the outputs from different programs for data
   preparation and analysis. These include (1) Groundwater Database (GWW)
   (2) Geographic Information System (GIS) (3) Groundwater Modelling System
   (GMS). In addition, the paper will summarize the data collection
   efforts, problems faced and experience gained working with heterogeneous
   media. This involves linking the results from various field
   investigations for groundwater development programs in the West Bank.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{A stochastic search technique, simulated annealing (SA), is used to
   optimize the operation of multiple reservoirs. Seminal application of
   annealing technique in general to multi-period, multiple-reservoir
   systems, along with problem representation and selection of different
   parameter values used in the annealing algorithm for specific cases is
   discussed. The search technique is improved with the help of heuristic
   rules, problem-specific information and concepts from the field of
   evolutionary algorithms. The technique is tested for application to a
   benchmark problem of four-reservoir system previously solved using a
   linear programming formulation and its ability to replicate the global
   optimum solution is examined. The technique is also applied to a system
   of four hydropower generating reservoirs in Manitoba, Canada, to derive
   optimal operating rules. A limited version of this problem is solved
   using a mixed integer non-linear programming and results are compared
   with those obtained using SA. A better objective function value is
   obtained using simulated annealing than the value from a mixed integer
   non-linear programming model developed for the same problem. Results
   obtained from these applications suggest that simulated annealing can be
   used for obtaining near-optimal solutions for multi-period reservoir
   operation problems that are computationally intractable.}},

   regionalization of unit hydrograph; wherein, the historical
   rainfall-runoff data of a number of gauged catchments are required to be
   analyzed. In this study, the GIUH derived from geomorphological
   characteristics of a catchment has been related to the parameters of
   Clark IUH model for deriving its complete shape. The DSRO hydrographs
   estimated by the GIUH based Clark model have been compared with the DSRO
   hydrographs computed by the Clark IUH model option of the HEC-1 package
   and the Nash IUH model by employing some of the commonly used error
   functions. Sensitivity analysis of the GIUH based Clark model has been
   conducted with the objective to identify the geomorphological and other
   model parameters which are more sensitive in estimation of peak of unit
   hydrographs computed by the GIUH based Clark model. So that these
   parameters may be evaluated with more precision for accurate estimation
   of flood hydrographs for the ungauged catchments.}},

Abstract = {{In the last 50 years, the broader Split area underwent an intensive
   development and urbanisation. Unfortunately, intensive development has
   not been followed by equally intensive infrastructure construction,
   especially wastewater infrastructure. In less than four decades, this
   attractive and beautiful, valuable tourist area, is turned into
   extremely degraded environment with very polluted coastal sea. In order
   to solve the problem and avoid further unwanted consequences, it has
   been planned to introduce integrated management of the environment. The
   priority was given to collection, treatment and disposal of industrial
   and urban wastewater. As a result, an integrated project of wastewater
   system development was proposed that had been in realisation since 1996.
   The problem solving requires an adequate organisation and support i.e.
   application of the decision support system (DSS) presented in this
   article. The DSS ensures horizontal integration, with a view to provide
   for co-operation between different sectors and local communities, and
   vertical integration among several authorised administrative and
   management levels, all aiming at co-ordination and harmonisation in
   implementation of the adopted problem solution policy.}},

Abstract = {{Water bodies are impacted by watershed loads in terms of nutrients and
   xenobiotics. This impact impairs the designated uses of the water body.
   Often preventive actions and end-of-pipe treatments do not reach the
   acceptable load to ensure the water quality standard in the water body.
   Wetlands are suitable tools for improving the self-purification capacity
   of a water system and can be used as a tool to reduce pollutant loads in
   a river network. This paper presents a methodology for the Siting and
   Sizing of created or restored wetlands at the watershed level, based on
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS) technique and estimations of
   wetland required area. The final outputs of the methodology are a Land
   Score System for Siting and a first rough estimation for the Sizing. The
   combination of these two elements is expected to be useful as a planning
   tool for watershed management and wetland planning. In order to assess
   the reliability of the procedure two very different case-studies are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a preliminary report of a research activity focusing on
   the effects of the crop potential evapotranspiration (ETp) generation
   methods on both the performance of a distributed catchment model as well
   as on the magnitude of its main effective parameters. The referred
   effects were assessed on the basis of the independent Multi-Calibration
   (MC) of the distributed model for which three different ETp scenarios
   were generated as follows: (A) FAO-24 standard approach; (B) FAO-24
   approach but used with coefficients of the wind function and of the
   Stefan-Boltzmann equation selected according to local conditions; and
   (C) FAO-56 standard approach. ETp was estimated as a function of the
   reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) by means of the k(c)-ET0
   approach. For assessing the performance of the estimation approach, the
   ET0 outputs of the three scenarios were compared to local ET0
   constraints derived from a previous research. The outputs of scenario B
   and scenario C showed a close agreement with the local ET0 constraints.
   Their effect on the performance of the hydrological model also seemed to
   be comparable. The output of scenario A produced higher estimates than
   the outputs of the other two scenarios, in the order of 200 mm per year.
   The best model performance was obtained by using the estimates of
   scenario A. The research also revealed the weak dependency of the model
   effective parameters inspected in this preliminary research on the ETp
   estimating methods.}},

Abstract = {{The lagoons of N.E. Greece, located on the western side of Nestos River,
   and of N.W. Greece, located at the lower reaches of Kalamas River, are
   among the most important shallow, semi-enclosed ecosystems in Northern
   Greece. The temporal variability of nutrients at both lagoonal systems
   shows the strong influence of fresh water discharge on water quality.
   Nutrient enrichment factors showed that nitrites and ammonium were six
   times higher at the lagoons of N.W. Greece than those observed at N.E.
   Greece, while phosphates were forty times higher at Nestos River
   lagoons. The flushing half-life was calculated based on a combination of
   hydrological and tidal processes, for each lagoon of these two systems,
   allowing for the assessment of water quality changes. Proper management
   measures for both systems should focus on the control of fresh water
   quality entering the lagoons, the reduction of phosphoric fertilizers
   used by agriculture and the better oxygenation of the water column. One
   way to eliminate massive fish deaths during the winter in N.E. Greece is
   also the transfer of fresh, warm groundwater, while bathymetric
   modifications and channel widening are needed at the lagoons of N.W.

Abstract = {{Earlier studies (Singh and Xu, 1997; Xu and Singh, 2000, 2001) have
   evaluated and compared various popular empirical evapotranspiration
   equations that belonged to three categories: (1) mass-transfer based
   methods, (2) radiation based methods, and (3) temperature-based methods;
   and the best and worst equations of each category were determined for
   the study regions. In this study a cross comparison of the best or
   representative equation forms selected from each category was made. Five
   representative empirical potential evapotranspiration equations selected
   from the three categories, namely: Hargreaves and Blaney-Criddle
   (temperature-based), Makkink and Priestley-Taylor (radiation-based) and
   Rohwer (mass-transfer-based) were evaluated and compared with the
   Penman-Monteith equation using daily meteorological data from the
   Changins station in Switzerland. The calculations of the Penman-Monteith
   equation followed the procedure recommended by FAO (Allen et al., 1998).
   The comparison was first made using the original constant values
   involved in each empirical equation and then made using the recalibrated
   constant values. The study showed that: (1) the original constant values
   involved in each empirical equation worked quite well for the study
   region, except that the value of alpha = 1.26 in Priestley-Taylor was
   found to be too high and the recalibration gave a value of alpha = 0.90
   for the region. (2) Improvement was achieved for the Blaney-Criddle
   method by adding a transition period in determining the parameter k. (3)
   The differences of performance between the best equation forms selected
   from each category are smaller than the differences between different
   equations within each category as reported in earlier studies (Xu and
   Singh, 2000, 2001). Further examination of the performance resulted in
   the following rank of accuracy as compared with the Penman-Monteith
   estimates: Priestley-Taylor and Makkink (Radiation-based), Hargreaves
   and Blaney-Criddle (temperature-based) and Rohwer (Mass-transfer).}},

Abstract = {{This study is aimed to use the available limited meteorological and
   hydrological data for two catchments located in the western Iraqi
   desert, to develop and apply a simple single event watershed model to
   simulate and predict the surface runoff hydrograph. The single event
   watershed model is based on the water balance equation. The inputs to
   the model are rainfall, evaporation, and soil properties data. The
   Resonbrock optimization technique is employed to determine the optimum
   parameters of the model. Also a simple and a modified version of this
   model is suggested and tested for the study area. The available rainfall
   and runoff data in these catchments have been used in calibrating and
   testing the model. In model testing, the optimized parameters for a
   particular storm are used to test the model performance on other
   available storms and so on. Sensitivity analysis has been used to
   determine the most sensitive parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The water resource issue is one of the most significant problems that
   the Yellow River basin will face this century, and one which has
   received much attention by public and government for several years.
   Water authorities will face great challenges in meeting the in-stream
   flow requirements and providing more water for growing populations,
   industry and agriculture. In order to evaluate the sustainability of the
   water resource system in the study area, an object-oriented system
   dynamics approach has been used to develop a model for the water
   resources system in the Yellow River basin, which is referred to as the
   Water Resources System Dynamics (WRSD) model. It has been developed for
   simulating a water resource system and capturing the dynamic character
   of the main elements affecting water demand and supply in the study
   area. For the business-as-usual (BaU) scenario, the water demands in the
   Yellow River basin are estimated 50.9, 56.5, and 59.5 billion m(3) for
   2010, 2020, and 2030. The existing and potential water supplies from
   surface water, aquifers and treated waste-water are estimated, and
   potential water demands for domestic, industrial and agricultural uses
   are projected. Various water supply and demand scenarios have then been
   explored by changing variables and parameters, and the sustainability
   index of the water supply system is estimated for different sub-regions
   over various periods.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the evaluation of indicators computed with a
   numerical simulation model of soil water and solute flow against field
   measurements of the amount of adsorbed and dissolved salts. In the
   Mediterranean environment, characterised by hot, dry summers, a field
   experiment on irrigation of vegetable crops with saline and tubewell
   water was carried out between 1988 and 1996 at a site near Naples,
   Italy. The investigation was carried out on a clay-loam soil classified
   as Argiustolls. Irrigation treatments were: tubewell water (no addition
   of NaCl), addition of 1.25, 2.5, 5 and 10 g(NaCl) L-1. Three irrigation
   intervals were applied until 1995: 2, 5 and 10 days. In 1995 all plots
   were irrigated on pre-selected days of the year, but the amount of water
   was equal to 100\%, respectively 75 and 50\% for the three irrigation
   treatments. Except 1996, all plots received consistently the same
   irrigation and salinity treatment, although different crops were grown
   on the same plot during the 8 yr experiment. In 1996, the indicator of
   soil salinity was used to evaluate the salt accumulation in the soil
   after a long time of saline irrigation. The indicator applied was the
   total amount of dissolved and adsorbed salts measured and simulated, in
   this way observation and model calculations are truly comparable. The
   aims were to evaluate the accuracy and relevance of salinity indicator
   computed by means of a numerical deterministic model describing water
   and solute transport SWAP. Total amount of salts were determined on soil
   samples, collected through the irrigation season on the treatments 0 and
   5 g(NaCl) L-1. The samples were taken at three depths. The CEC and
   soluble salt were measured, beside the initial (prior to saturation in
   the laboratory) composition of the soil samples. Total dissolved and
   adsorbed salts were calculated throughout the irrigation season with the
   model SWAP. Calculated salt concentration was compared with observed
   soil composition to assess the accuracy of model calculations.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure, based on the distribution of the largest streamflow drought
   deficit and on the composite hydrograph recession curve, is proposed for
   the derivation of the n-year streamflow drought, for the cases for which
   the assumption of identical deficit and duration frequencies is not
   valid, for a given river at a given location. The present article is a
   continuation of the previous work of Zelenhasic on the extremes of low
   flows. The previous streamflow drought stochastic model dealt with the
   situation where their exists the equality of probability of occurrence
   of extreme drought deficit and extreme drought duration, i.e. the
   assumption of identical deficit and duration frequencies. In practice,
   the condition of identical frequencies is often mitigated by the less
   stringent condition of approximate frequencies. The present article
   analyzes the situation in which there is no equality of probability of
   occurrence of extreme drought deficit and extreme drought duration. Or,
   to be more specific, this method has no constraints such as the
   assumption of identical deficit and duration frequencies. The earlier
   theoretical explanations of the individual streamflow drought components
   of the method of streamflow drought stochastic process are completely
   valid in this paper, as well. The method has been applied in this paper
   to data from gaging stations on the Sava River at Srem. Mitrovica, the
   Drava River at D. Miholjac and the Danube River at Bezdan. The
   application of the procedure has shown that the method is simple,
   reliable and efficient.}},

Abstract = {{Animal feeding operations are being targeted as sources of point and

   governments and agencies are enacting new regulations proscribing
   activities to reduce pollutants entering waters. Pursuant to the Clean
   Water Act, the United States federal government regulates concentrated
   animal feeding operations (CAFOs) as point sources of pollution. In
   2001, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency advanced more stringent
   regulations for CAFOs despite the fact that approximately 80\% of the
   CAFOs have not secured permits as required by federal law. An analysis
   of enforcement mechanisms and opportunities for greater enforcement
   suggests that reductions in pollution could come from more effective
   enforcement. Rather than adopting more regulations for animal feeding
   operations, governments might direct their resources towards detecting
   and enforcing existing provisions.}},

Abstract = {{Due to increasing trend of intensive rice cultivation in a coastal river
   basin, crop planning and groundwater management are imperative for the
   sustainable agriculture. For effective management, two models have been
   developed viz. groundwater balance model and optimum cropping and
   groundwater management model to determine optimum cropping pattern and
   groundwater allocation from private and government tubewells according
   to different soil types (saline and non-saline), type of agriculture
   (rainfed and irrigated) and seasons (monsoon and winter). A groundwater
   balance model has been developed considering mass balance approach. The
   components of the groundwater balance considered are recharge from
   rainfall, irrigated rice and non-rice fields, base flow from rivers and
   seepage flow from surface drains. In the second phase, a linear
   programming optimization model is developed for optimal cropping and
   groundwater management for maximizing the economic returns. The models
   developed were applied to a portion of coastal river basin in Orissa
   State, India and optimal cropping pattern for various scenarios of river
   flow and groundwater availability was obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Fuzzy multiobjective decision making models generally rely on the
   aggregation of the objectives to form a decision function. The
   generalized averaging operator is usually adopted for aggregating
   multiple and unequal objectives because it allows trade-off amongst the
   objectives, and has been shown to be suitable to model human decision
   making behavior. In the field of water resource management, most of the
   decision-making problems involving the generalized averaging operator
   implicitly assume the decision maker (DM) is rather optimistic. The
   analysis of the DM's behavior during the aggregation process and its
   impact on the performance of the system, has therefore never been
   addressed by many researchers and decision makers. The aim of this paper
   is to investigate the relationship between decision makers' index of
   optimism and the long-term performance of a reservoir resource. More
   specifically, the generalized averaging operator, whose parameter can be
   interpreted as the DM's index of optimism, is imbedded into a fuzzy
   stochastic dynamic program (FSDP). This approach is developed and
   implemented to derive optimal operating policies for the hydroelectric
   complex of the Uruguay River basin in Southern Brazil. FSDP-derived
   policies with different indices of optimism are then compared with
   simulation. We show that system performance may be influenced by the
   decision maker's behavior during the aggregation, and that the
   optimistic assumption may not yield to satisfactory results, especially
   during critical time periods.}},

   test the significance of the lag-k sample serial correlation coefficient
   (r(k)) of a time series. The bootstrap approach is free of sample

   understand and implement. Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the
   bootstrap test has the same power as the conventional parametric test
   for assessing the significance of a lag-one serial correlation
   coefficient (r(1)). The usefulness of the bootstrap test is demonstrated
   by applying it to assess the significance of r(k) of the annual mean

Abstract = {{This article investigates the influence of conceptual flow simulation
   model parameters (i.e coefficients and constants that need to be
   estimated in calibration) on model solution (surface runoff) to
   understand the characteristics of the model. A new conceptual watershed
   yield model (WYM) was employed. There are four physical parameters, two
   fitting coefficients and two initial estimates of the surface water and
   groundwater storages that control the functioning of the model. The
   conceptual model was applied on Ling River near Kahuta and detailed
   sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the most sensitive model
   parameters. The most sensitive model parameters worked out were C-g (a
   fitting coefficient, which reflects the rate at which groundwater runoff
   occurs), w(r) (watershed retention is the initial rainfall losses before
   runoff begins), p(gr) (input parameter that reflects the discharge
   capacity of the groundwater aquifer). The model parameters like i(c)
   (infiltration coefficient), g(wsm) (input parameter that depends on the
   subsurface storage available in the watershed) and e(p) (input
   parameter) have negligible effect on model solution. It was observed
   that w(r) (watershed retention) is the only surface runoff controlling
   parameter and p(gr) and C-g are the groundwater runoff controlling
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{A neural networks approach is applied to the derivation of the operating
   rules of an irrigation supply reservoir. Operating rules are determined
   as a two step process: first, a dynamic programming technique, which
   determines the optimal releases by minimizing the sum of squared
   deficits, assumed as objective function, subject to various constraints
   is applied. Then, the resulting releases from the reservoir are
   expressed as a function of significant variables by neural networks.
   Neural networks are trained on a long period, including severe drought
   events, and the operation rules so determined are validated on a
   different shorter period. The behaviour of different operating rules is
   assessed by simulating reservoir operation and by computing several
   performance indices of the reservoir and crop yield through a soil water
   balance model. Results show that operating rules based on an
   optimization with constraints resembling real system operation criteria
   lead to a good performance both in normal and in drought periods,
   reducing maximum deficits and water spills.}},

Abstract = {{A decision support system (DFMS) for forecasting domestic water demand
   including demand management was developed as part of a highly integrated
   decision-support system for river-basin management. The system provides
   water resources planners with the facilities for estimating future water

   regard, to the possibility of introducing demand management measures.
   The system has the capability of predicting domestic-water demand by
   various methods according to data availability. It can compute
   conservation effectiveness due to the implementation of various
   demand-management measures, forecasting the number of customers for
   different consumption units (person, household and water connection) and
   facilitating the development of demand-scenarios for evaluating various
   options. In general, the system comprises of the following components:
   (1) geographic information system, (2) database management system, (3)
   expert system, (4) multi-decision component, (5) prediction models, (6)

Abstract = {{Multi-criteria or multi-objective decision-making is becoming
   increasingly popular as a decision support tool for natural resource
   management. Stakeholders as well as the planners can be involved in the
   decision making process, using this approach. This article deals with
   the use of multi-criteria (multi-objective) technique in solving some
   complex problems related to water resource management. Five objectives
   were considered in the study. The benefit of combining these objective
   functions with the decision support tool is that the management of land
   and water resources can be made more effectively. Based on this concept,
   a methodology was developed through this study, for the water managers
   and decision-makers, to obtain a compromising solution in terms of area
   allocated under different crops and the magnitude of farming system
   variables in a canal command area. This study was under taken in the
   Mahanadi Delta of India. Multi-objective techniques such as Sequential
   Linear Fuzzy Programming and Goal Programming were used for their
   simplicity in computation and flexibility in application. Using Fuzzy
   programming technique, the objective function values under benefit
   maximization, production maximization, investment minimization, labour
   maximization and labour minimization were found to be 44.26 M INR, 8795
   tonnes, 42.00 M INR and 548 150 man-days, respectively. These results
   were found to be quite compromising in nature. Goal programming
   technique was also used to arrive at a consensus in allocation of the
   resources. It was used to decide the best out of the eight alternative
   priorities. Results indicated that only five alternative goals (Goal1,
   Goal2, Goal3, Goal6 and Goal8) had distinct allocations while the other
   three alternatives (Goal4, Goal5 and Goal7) had allocations similar to
   either of the above five alternatives irrespective of their priority
   levels. Cropping intensity was found to be the maximum (238\%) for two
   of the goals (Goal6 and Goal7). Though the results of the study were for
   the specific site, the multi-criteria techniques used and the
   recommendations evolved are of objective nature and are applicable at
   any location for decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Water management steers a middle course between control and chaos. The
   concept of control in water management is the topic of this paper.
   Conditions for control in water management are: a consistent policy,
   gaining support and an adequate information supply. It is demonstrated
   that the balance between these three conditions of control depends on
   the type of water management considered. In this paper four different
   types of water management are distinguished based on the conditions for
   control. The concept presented in this paper is validated on basis of
   three case studies. The paper concludes with a presentation of an
   approach which is interactive and aims at an integral and sustainable

Abstract = {{Selection of a storage capacity for the design of a river reservoir is
   made traditionally by the Rippl mass curve method or the sequent-peak
   algorithm. Both methods offer a single value of storage capacity to a
   water resources engineer. Synthetic hydrology approach by which long
   synthetic flow data are generated is also commonly used. In the present
   study a hybrid technique combining these two approaches is developed.
   The technique is based on wavelets, which are functions of zero-mean and
   finite variance, and it generates synthetic sequent-peak algorithms.
   Haar wavelet is used in the generation scheme. The generation scheme is
   applicable to non-skewed sequences. The application of the technique to
   a 64-year long annual flow data suggests that the technique can be a
   useful tool in the selection of a storage capacity for the design of a
   river reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of surface water and groundwater resources in south
   Taiwan was simulated based on the forecasted demand and water supply
   system in 2011. Three strategies allocating water resources, which are
   the priority of benefit of water usage, the priority of right of water
   usage and the priority of purpose of water usage, were tested under
   different hydrological conditions and constraints of groundwater
   abstraction. The results indicate that the key factor of water shortages
   in south Taiwan is the lack of storage infrastructures. Moreover, the
   irrigation water must be transferred to the industrial sectors for
   improving the overall benefits of water usage during a water shortage
   period. In order to meet the future water requirements in south Taiwan,
   the preferable resolution for government is to construct reservoirs and
   weirs, so that the strategic storing water can be utilized in wet season
   and support the shortage of the dry season. Furthermore, it is necessary
   to set a fair and reasonable compensation standard of water transfer in
   order to avoid the conflict between traders.}},

Abstract = {{The efficient operation and management of an existing water supply
   system require short-term water demand forecasts as inputs.
   Conventionally, regression and time series analysis have been employed
   in modelling short-term water demand forecasts. The relatively new
   technique of artificial neural networks has been proposed as an
   efficient tool for modelling and forecasting in recent years. The
   primary objective of this study is to investigate the relatively new
   technique of artificial neural networks for use in forecasting
   short-term water demand at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.
   Other techniques investigated in this study include regression and time
   series analysis for comparison purposes. The secondary objective of this
   study is to investigate the validity of the following two hypotheses: 1)
   the short-term water demand process at the Indian Institute of
   Technology, Kanpur campus is a dynamic process mainly driven by the
   maximum air temperature and interrupted by rainfall occurrences, and 2)
   occurrence of rainfall is a more significant variable than the rainfall
   amount itself in modelling the short-term water demand forecasts. The
   data employed in this study consist of weekly water demand at the Indian
   Institute of Technology, Kanpur campus, and total weekly rainfall and
   weekly average maximum air temperature from the City of Kanpur, India.
   Six different artificial neural network models, five regression models,
   and two time series models have been developed and compared. The
   artificial neural network models consistently outperformed the
   regression and time series models developed in this study. An average
   absolute error in forecasting of 2.41\% was achieved from the best
   artificial neural network model, which also showed the best correlation
   between the modelled and targeted water demands. It has been found that
   the water demand at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur campus is
   better correlated with the rainfall occurrence rather than the amount of
   rainfall itself.}},

   satisfactorily. An optimization model was developed to solve the water
   resources of a large project in a computationally satisfactory manner.
   The optimal reservoir storage, optimal irrigation demand, and optimal
   reservoir release were computed. The optimal mean (1987-1997) model
   total water requirements for the dry and wet seasons were also computed
   and the optimal contributions by rainfall, reservoir, uncontrolled river
   flow, and recycled water were determined. The mean annual optimal water

Abstract = {{Flooding is a natural disaster that may cause tremendous tangible and
   intangible damage to the national economy. The tangible damage
   assessment, i.e. the monetary value of all direct and indirect physical
   damages, has already been studied, while intangible damages have not yet
   been taken into account. This article, therefore, is the first
   systematic attempt to assess both tangible and intangible damages. The
   new proposed `Anxiety-Productivity and Income Interrelationgship
   Approach (API)' has been developed to quantify the intangible damage in
   monetary terms. The Bangkok area has been selected as the research area
   because several severe flood events have occurred there over the last
   two decades. The 1983 Bangkok flood caused 6600 million baht in damage,
   according to estimates by the National Statistical Office (NSO). This
   article examines the total flood damage (including the intangible
   damage) at different flood magnitudes. Case studies `with' and `without'
   flood mitigation projects are studied and compared. Furthermore, this
   article also discusses the improvements over the conventional approach
   offered by the new API methodology.}},

Abstract = {{No phytoplankton should be present in treated drinking water because of
   its potential for bad odor and toxins that may pose hazards to animals
   and humans upon consumption. This study describes the efficiency of alum
   and lime-alum treatments for removing phytoplankton from the Nile river
   water used as a source of drinking water in Egypt. The results showed
   that alum could not precipitate all phosphate nor coagulate bloom
   forming cyanobacteria present in the water sample. On the other hand,
   lime-alum treatment precipitated much more phosphate than alum, and
   coagulated all phytoplankton present in the water samples including
   those that could not be coagulated by alum. Furthermore, lime-alum
   treatment did not change the pH of the water during all the experiment
   period. Hence, it is suggested that lime-alum be used instead of alum
   during water treatment processes in Egypt.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a prototype, user-interactive computing system for
   the operational management of the Kirazdere reservoir in Turkey. The aim
   is to make best use of the full storage capacity of the reservoir for
   meeting the contractual water-supply obligations as consistently as
   possible, having regard to the possible risk of downstream flooding. In
   determining the amount to be released for supply purposes in any one
   month, the system takes account of the current storage level and
   predicted inflow. In doing so, the system incorporates the prevailing
   situation with water-release rules previously derived using a
   combination of optimisation and simulation-based scenarios analyses,
   thereby providing a comprehensive analytical capability which is easy to
   manipulate. For each month, the system provides the operator with a
   proposed release schedule as well as the opportunity to explore the
   consequences of alternatives, in terms of the reservoir performance
   criteria. An important feature of the system is the ability to quickly
   evaluate a priori, the impacts of different release decisions over an
   extended period of time for a variety of possible inflow scenarios,
   including extreme drought and flood periods, helping the operator to
   establish the robustness of a particular operating policy. Whilst the
   system has been specifically designed to support the operation of the
   Kirazdere reservoir, its extension to include a more general class of
   reservoir management problems would be comparatively simple.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the present paper the authors analyse the drought occurrence over the
   European region by using the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis precipitation rates
   covering the period from 1948 to 2000. The drought assessment is based
   on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), which has been proposed
   as an indicator of drought condition. At variance with other fields
   derived from precipitation, the SPI is, by construction, a Gaussian
   field. Thus, the understanding of its covariance structure exhausts the
   study of the associated density distribution. A method allowing a
   factorisation of a multivariate Gaussian distribution is the one known
   as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Kauman-Loeve decomposition.
   Therefore, a PCA is used to study the main spatial patterns and the time
   variability of drought first over Europe and then over the Northern
   Hemisphere. The analysis reveals a downward trend for the index over
   most of central Europe and the Mediterranean basin, implying an overall
   decrease of precipitation in the above mentioned regions. Moreover, the
   scores associated with the PCA covariance decomposition, besides the
   aforementioned trend, show few long-term periodicities. Similar drought
   analyses have been performed by considering the Palmer Drought Severity
   Index (PDSI). A preliminary comparison between the SPI and PDSI obtained
   by using the previously discussed data set is presented. It is shown
   that the indices compare favourably in assessing drought variability.
   Finally, when the SPI analysis is extended to the Northern Hemisphere
   some interesting spatially remote teleconnnections linking the Tropical
   Pacific with the European area are shown.}},

Abstract = {{Many agrarian countries have heavily invested in large-scale water
   projects to promote their agricultural development. There have been,
   however, few attempts to devise strategic water resources planning
   accounting for the macroeconomic linkages of agriculture. This article
   presents such a strategic water resources planning framework for
   Bangladesh. First, a dynamic cost minimization model is solved to
   compute the optimal investment needed in various water projects such
   that an agricultural growth target can be met. Next, the minimum cost
   solution is again derived accounting for the macroeconomic linkages of
   agriculture, which, under different macroeconomic scenarios, results in
   noticeably different policy implications for optimal water planning.
   These results suggest that the traditional sectoral approaches of
   planning water investment projects are generally inconsistent with the
   broader macroeconomic reality of Bangladesh.}},

Abstract = {{The Sinai Peninsula has an area of 61000 km(2) and its population is
   about 325000. It is located in an arid area. Extensive development in
   the socio-economic, industrial and agricultural is in process. Although
   Lower Cretaceous aquifer is the most prospective aquifer in Sinai, it is
   not yet precisely evaluated. Spatially distributed areas of good
   groundwater quality suitable for various types of development are not
   identified. The current article presents a comprehensive assessment of
   the hydrogeological information and hydrological data. Accordingly,
   three aquifer zones have been identified. Groundwater reserve was
   estimated and groundwater balance has been developed. Development
   potential was evaluated. Development criteria were proposed and applied.
   Suitable areas for domestic and irrigation purposes were delineated.
   Results indicated that the aquifer contains 308 billion m(3) of
   groundwater of which a considerable volume is of good quality. By
   lowering the present water level some 200 meters, the aquifer yielded
   3643 million m(3), which is sufficient to supply the present rate of
   withdrawal for 445 years. The results are considered to be useful for
   preparing groundwater master plans in Sinai. Under the proper water
   management, Sinai could be self sufficient in satisfying its domestic
   water demand.}},

   productivity in seriously affected farms was to increase the household
   income by provision of compensation or input subsidy or finance for
   starting of allied activities. In moderately affected farms, abandoning
   tannery waste application and increasingly employing irrigation water
   averting expenditure could enhance the value productivity. In low

Pages = {{17-30}},
Abstract = {{Though the minimum area section is generally adopted for canals, it is
   not the least earthwork cost section as it does not involve the cost of
   earthwork which varies with the excavation depth. On account of
   complexities of analysis, explicit design equations for minimum
   earthwork cost canal sections has not available yet. In this
   investigation explicit equations and section shape coefficients for the
   design variables of minimum earthwork cost canal sections for
   triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal, and circular shapes have been

Abstract = {{The recent global experience of the 1998 El Nino has caused a long
   drought in Malaysia. The lack of rainfall in the catchment areas
   especially in the state of Selangor has resulted the two dams that
   supply water to Kuala Lumpur and surrounding regions to almost critical
   levels. The water crisis lasted from March to September 1998 and
   affected 1.8 million residents. This study was undertaken to investigate
   the consumers' level of satisfaction towards the strategy of the water
   crisis management undertaken by the state water authority. The effect of
   the crisis and the coping behaviour of the affected residents were also
   assessed. Data were collected by using interview survey on 140 residents
   living in one of the affected regions. It was found that on the whole
   the residents were only moderately satisfied with the strategy of water
   crisis management carried out by the state water authority. They were
   very unsatisfied with the quantity and quality of water provided and the
   distance to fetch the water from the static tanks. Majority of the
   respondents adopted a coping strategy by prioritizing their daily
   activities. The crisis had affected their work and daily activities. The
   positive effect of the crisis was the changing attitude of the residents
   in appreciation of the value of water and an increase in neighbourly
   spirit and relationships. Underlying causes were analyzed, ways to
   overcome any future water crisis were discussed and recommendations were
   proposed.}},

Title = {{Estimation of soil erosion for a Himalayan watershed using GIS technique}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-54}},
Abstract = {{The fragile ecosystem of the Himalayas has been an increasing cause of
   concern to environmentalists and water resources planners. The steep
   slopes in the Himalayas along with depleted forest cover, as well as
   high seismicity have been major factors in soil erosion and
   sedimentation in river reaches. Prediction of soil erosion is a
   necessity if adequate provision is to be made in the design of
   conservation structures to offset the ill effects of sedimentation
   during their lifetime. In the present study, two different soil erosion
   models, i.e. the Morgan model and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)
   model, have been used to estimate soil erosion from a Himalayan
   watershed. Parameters required for both models were generated using
   remote sensing and ancillary data in GIS mode. The soil erosion
   estimated by Morgan model is in the order of 2200 t km(-2) yr(-1) and is
   within the limits reported for this region. The soil erosion estimated
   by USLE gives a higher rate. Therefore, for the present study the Morgan
   model gives, for area located in hilly terrain, fairly good results.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to determine the optimal nonlinear
   pricing rules for water services. The model presents a standard water
   distribution system and a separate wastewater collection and treatment
   system. Technical and financial constraints are considered. The
   optimization process of a welfare utility function subject to different
   kind of constraints provides the optimal pricing rules for drinking
   water and sewerage services. These prices reflect efficiently the costs
   of systems constraints, the cyclicity of demands, the time-of-use,
   heterogeneity types of consumers and the real value of water resources
   scarcity. They provide important guidance in the design of efficient
   water rates and in the development of different water utilities planning
   strategies. New technologies in water metering (telemetry) should permit
   applying this model.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical analysis of parameters and residuals of conceptual
   hydrological models has received little effort in the hydrological
   research, certainly by orders of magnitude less than on many other
   problems like development and comparison of automatic calibration
   methods, optimisation algorithms, etc. Much more work is required than
   is presently undertaken to investigate the properties of model
   residuals. There is a need of an easily understandable and applicable
   statistical analysis scheme. In this article, a procedure is presented
   through which two basic issues of model evaluation are accounted for.
   First, different techniques used for parameter analysis are discussed.
   Second, methodology of residual analysis is discussed and the general
   behaviours of residuals are examined. To illustrate the procedure, a
   simple water balance model was applied to the Stabbybacken River Basin
   in central Sweden.}},

Abstract = {{Part of the northern Carpathian Mountains, the flysch-built Carpathian
   Foothills form a low-mountain area (300-500 m) with dense population and
   intensive farming. Here, in 1981-1995, a water circulation research
   project was conducted in the Wierzbanowka catchment basin (11.7 km(2)),
   a typical catchment basin of this land. The Carpathian Foothills are
   characterised with a relatively high fluctuation in the activity of the
   underground water effluents (outflow), ground water level and
   watercourse discharge. This is a result of the area's irregular
   precipitation patterns, low water penetrability of the ground, low
   underground and surface water retention and of the terrain gradients and
   the complex relief. The high rate of the water circulation is also a
   result of the dominance of the agricultural use of land (60-80\% of the
   total area), low forest coverage (10-30\%) and the inadequate water
   resource management. Possible actions aiming to reduce the dynamics of
   the water circulation in this area should include the following: turning
   of a portion of the existing farmland into forestland, boosting the area
   of pastures and meadows, restoration of the natural character of river
   channels and valley bottoms, reinstating certain small water management
   facilities (ponds, dykes, etc.).}},

Abstract = {{A physically based two-dimensional model is applied to the case-study
   site of Abbeystead Reservoir, U.K. The model, developed for density
   currents, solves the Navier-Stokes equation coupled to a general
   sediment transport equation. Water flow and sediment motion are
   determined by reference to dimensionless Reynolds and Richardson
   numbers. An additional dimensionless parameter, pia, determines
   suspended and/or bedload sediment transport rates. The performance of
   the model is considered in relation to data obtained from repeated
   bathymetric surveys (1876-1991) for Abbeystead Reservoir, which provides
   an exceptionally detailed long-term record of sedimentation rates and
   deposition patterns. The suitability of the adopted two-dimensional
   scheme is related to the local morphology of the reservoir and the
   time-scale of the delta propagation process. First results show good
   agreement between the numerical simulations and the field data. The
   model is able to reproduce both the dynamics of delta growth and the
   quasi-equilibrium delta form reached as the infilling process nears
   completion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology for determining optimal operation
   of soil aquifer treatment (SAT) systems considering parameter
   uncertainty. The problem of optimal operation of SAT systems is
   formulated and solved in a discrete-time optimal control framework by
   interfacing the SALQR (Successive Approximation Linear Quadratic
   Regulator) optimizer with the MSTS (Multiphase Subsurface Transport
   Simulator) model. Both deterministic and stochastic programming
   formulations have been solved. Through the use of first-order analysis
   of uncertainties, the uncertainty of the water content due to the
   uncertainties of the simulation parameters are evaluated. A chance
   constrained formulation of the optimization is utilized to account for
   the uncertainties of water content in the SAT operation. This approach
   enables one to quantify the uncertainty of the parameter estimates, and
   automatically account for the parameter uncertainty in the
   decision-making process through the SAT management model.}},

Abstract = {{Feldspar, among many natural substances such as termite mount-clay,
   saw-dust, kaolinite and dolomite, offers a significant removal ability
   for sulfate, phosphate, and colored substances. Optimization of
   experimental parameters such as solution pH and flow rate reveals, that
   the maximum efficiency for removal of phosphate, sulfate, and colored
   substances is about 42, 52, and 73\% respectively. X-ray diffraction,
   adsorption isotherm and recovery studies suggest, that the removal
   process of anions occurs via ion exchange in conjunction with surface
   adsorption. Furthermore, reaction rate studies indicate that the removal
   of the selected pollutants by feldspar follows first-order kinetics.
   Although the percent removal, under the optimized conditions, is higher
   for laboratory prepared solutions, efficiency is a little less for
   industrial effluents due to interferent effects.}},

Abstract = {{The present article demonstrates the implementation of Multicriterion
   Decision Making (MCDM) analysis for a case study of Flumen Monegros
   irrigation area in the Huesca province of Spain. The criteria used to
   rank alternatives consist of (1) economic factors including initial cost

   of European subsidies; (2) environmental factors which comprise water
   volume, water quality after irrigation, efficiency of the use of water,
   resistance to floods or droughts; (3) Social factors including
   employment of rural labour, area non-cultivated. Alternative policies
   are formulated by mixing factors such as irrigation system, water
   pricing, water allocation, crop distribution, fertiliser use, subsidies
   received. Multicriterion Sorting Technique (MCST) ELECTRE-TRI is
   employed to reduce the large size payoff matrix to predefined categories
   for further usage of MCDM techniques. Five MCDM techniques, namely,
   PROMETHEE-2, EXPROM-2, ELECTRE-3, ELECTRE-4, and Compromise Programming
   (CP) are employed to rank the alternatives. Spearman rank correlation
   coefficient is employed to assess the correlation coefficient between
   the ranking patterns obtained by the above MCDM techniques. Additive
   ranking principle is used for group decision making analysis. Results
   indicate that five MCDM techniques choose the same alternative strategy

Pages = {{457-472}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{For a multireservoir system, where the number of reservoirs is large,
   the conventional modelling by classical stochastic dynamic programming
   (SDP) presents difficulty, due to the curse of dimensionality inherent
   in the model solution. It takes a long time to obtain a steady state
   policy and also it requires large amount of computer storage space,
   which form drawbacks in application. An attempt is made to explore the
   concept of fuzzy sets to provide a viable alternative in this context.
   The application of fuzzy set theory to water resources systems is
   illustrated through the formulation of a fuzzy mathematical programming
   model to a multireservoir system with a number of upstream parallel
   reservoirs, and one downstream reservoir. The study is aimed to minimize
   the sum of deviations of the irrigation withdrawals from their target
   demands, on a monthly basis, over a year. Uncertainty in reservoir
   inflows is considered by treating them as fuzzy sets. The model
   considers deterministic irrigation demands. The model is applied to a
   three reservoir system in the Upper Cauvery River basin, South India.
   The model clearly demonstrates that, use of fuzzy linear programming in
   multireservoir system optimization presents a potential alternative to
   get the steady state solution with a lot less effort than classical
   stochastic dynamic programming.}},

Abstract = {{Water management projects are complex and contain many dimensions,
   including the nature of the problem, technological challenges, and
   political relevance. Experts and consultants in water management usually
   work with a limited set of analysis and project planning methods. This
   implies that experts and consultants have a restricted spectrum for
   bidding on water management projects and that the engagement of a
   specific expert or consultant introduces a biased approach to water
   management. To alleviate these limitations, experts and consultants
   should have a readily accessible collection of analysis and project
   management methods at their disposal, coupled with guidelines for
   combining these methods to best approach a water management project. In
   this paper we propose a taxonomy for classifying methods used in water
   management. Using this taxonomy, we derive a Project Management
   Specification Model (PMSM) to help experts select, combine, and
   operationalize methods to match best the requirements posed by a
   project. The taxonomy and PMSM were derived and validated by analyzing
   more than 90 methods together with experts in the field of water
   management, and by using them within two new project proposals made by
   an engineering company. We could conclude that PMSM's broad view on
   water management helps experts and consultants choose flexible analysis
   and project management approaches, and that it increases the involvement
   of, and acceptance by, all parties involved in water management.}},

Abstract = {{Water shortage is a serious problem in most countries in the Middle
   East. Irrigation water consumes about three-fourths of the available
   fresh water resources in Jordam and many other countries in the region.
   This article presents a practical approach to manage and optimize the
   irrigation water use in the region. The ultimate objective is to
   minimize the outside water and to manage the irrigation water use under
   geographic, socio-economic, and demographic constraints. This approach
   uses the added value (net revenue) of one cubic meter of water concept
   in evaluating different irrigation water use management. This concept
   has been demonstrated, based on a case study in the Jordan Valley. This
   case study shows that water scarcity can be incorporated in irrigation
   water management by proper choice of crops and farming patters. The
   objective function is to maximize the net revenue from the agricultural
   production process subjected to limitation on water and other production
   and marketing factors. Results of analysis showed that a net water
   saving of about 9\% occurred if the objective function is to minimize
   water use under the same level of profitability. This example shall be
   useful for water and agricultural planners. Sometimes virtual water is
   widely exported in form of crops that consumes large amounts of water
   without full economic consideration to the added value of water. In some
   cases, food imports may be a feasible option in water-poor countries
   instead of water import.}},

Abstract = {{In large metropolitan areas of the world the operation and management
   programs for water supply reservoirs play a dominant role in economic,
   social and cultural growth and development. An unprecedented population
   increase in addition to intensive migration from rural areas add extra
   pressure on the available limited natural resources such as land, air
   and water. Although there are many optimization techniques including
   simple linear or dynamic programming which might also include chance
   constraints, they are rather sophisticated for layman operators who deal
   with the real time joint operation of various reservoirs. Furthermore,
   these operation programs require data on daily basis on hydrologic
   variable such as rainfall, runoff, evaporation and others which might
   not be available in sufficient amounts. It is, therefore, necessary to
   develop simple, dynamic and adaptive operation rules according to the
   special set up of the reservoirs for each city water resources. This
   article provides the fundamentals of Istanbul city
   water-supply-reservoir operation rules suitable for the combination of
   already existing Supervised Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) unit of
   the city. The operation rules are developed on daily basis under the
   worst possible constraints to appear. The suggested model is named
   Simple Adaptive Daily Dynamic Program (SADP which runs on the concept of
   critical duration with unpredictable rainfall-runoff, evaporation and
   infiltration properties.}},

Pages = {{369-376}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative understanding and prediction of the processes of runoff
   generation and its transmission to the outlet represent one of the most
   basic and challenging areas of hydrology. Traditional techniques for
   design flood estimation use historical rainfall-runoff data for unit
   hydrograph derivation. Such techniques have been widely applied for the
   estimation of design flood hydrograph at the sites of gauged catchment.
   For ungauged catchments, unit hydrograph may be derived using either
   regional unit hydrograph approach or alternatively Geomorhological
   Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (GIUH) approach. The unit hydrograph thus
   derived may be used for the simulation of flood events for the ungauged
   catchments. In this study Gambhiri dam catchment located in Rajasthan,
   India is selected for applying this approach. Gambhiri river is a small
   tributary of the Berach/Banas river of the Chambal basin in Rajasthan,
   India. The objective of the present study is to apply Geographical
   Information System (GIS) supported GIUH approach for the estimation of
   design flood. A mathematical model has been developed at the National
   Institute of Hydrology, which enables the evaluation of the Clark Model
   parameters using geomorphological characteristics of the basin. This
   model has been applied for the present study. From this study it is
   observed that the peak characteristics of the design flood are more
   sensitive to the various storm pattern as well as method of critical
   sequencing followed for the computation of design storm patterns.
   Earlier estimates for the peak and time to peak hydrograph was 9143.74
   cumec and 18 hrs. respectively. However, the estimates for the peak
   characteristics of design flood hydrograph obtained from the GIUH based
   approach are 11870.6 cumec and 19 hrs. respectively considering the same
   design storm pattern.}},

Abstract = {{High groundwater temperatures at shallow levels have been recorded in
   the Great Artesian Basin, Australia. In the most part of the Basin
   geothermal gradients are above the global average. It is suggested that
   geothermal gradients determine the groundwater flow patterns in the
   Basin aquifers. Six extensive regions where Rayleigh numbers exceed the
   critical value for the onset of thermal convection are identified.
   Further numerical experiments with parameters derived from field
   observations show that thermal convection can actually occur in these
   regions. The identified convective regions are large in size (of the
   order of 100 km horizontally) and coincide with important groundwater
   management zones. Within the convective regions the groundwater flow is
   not horizontal but has a significant vertical component.
   Thermally-induced vertical flows result in intensive mass transfer
   within and between aquifer layers. In the groundwater management
   context, the latter means a higher degree of vulnerability of the Basin
   aquifers. Numerical models with incorporated coupling between heat and
   mass transfer processes are shown to be appropriate for the impact
   assessment of management strategies in the Basin.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystem Management (EM) is a new holistic approach to the management
   of natural resources. It integrates the scientific knowledge on
   ecological interrelationships and the complex socioeconomic and
   political frame of values, aiming at the long-term sustainability of a
   region, i.e., the ecosystem. It includes the human, biological and
   natural dimensions, and can regulate the internal structures and
   functions of the ecosystem, and the inputs and outputs from it, so that
   solutions to development and protection problems can be achieved and be
   socially well-accepted. It has been given attention since 1991, mainly
   in the U.S.A., where the existing legal framework formed a basis for EM.
   The former experience of programs based on the traditional methods of
   management, the goal of sustainable development stated by many
   governmental, public or private agencies, and the advent of scientific
   knowledge, permitted the development of a theoretical basis for EM.
   Today, a significant number of EM programs have been established and are
   in progress in the U.S.A. Here the concept, general principles and
   methodology of EM are reviewed, and the EM program in the State of
   Florida in the U.S.A. is presented, which is considered a successful
   case study. In addition, the examples of management of two very
   important ecosystems in Northern Greece are critically presented for
   comparison, in order to evaluate if they have EM characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of degraded and creation of constructed wetlands require
   proper hydraulic design. Of particular importance is the accurate
   determination of flow resistance factors and the proper use of
   resistance equations, something essential for computing basic hydraulic
   parameters, such as depth and velocity, and for modeling the
   hydrodynamics of the system. In this study, selected previous
   theoretical, laboratory and field studies on wetlands and
   vegetated-channel hydraulics are reviewed, and existing data from these
   studies are extracted and compiled in a common database. Resistance
   determining parameters are discussed, and results are summarized and
   presented, aiming at obtaining laws governing the flow, and deriving
   values for frictional factors under various flow scenarios. Graphs of
   Darcy-Weisbach f or Manning's n versus appropriate hydraulic parameters
   are presented. A modified n-VR graph is also presented, appropriate for
   marsh preliminary hydraulic analyses and design. These graphs also
   indicate missing information and can guide in future research.}},

Abstract = {{Depiction of precipitation change by elevation in an area indicates the
   possibilities of orographic rainfall occurrences in the mountainous
   regions. In general, precipitation increases with elevation but
   sometimes inverse cases occur locally due to orographic and
   meteorological features of the area. In practice, prior to any
   quantitative modeling, qualitative assessments and interpretations help
   to have sound foundations in search for a suitable model. In this
   article, standardized point cumulative semivariogram (SPCSV) methodology
   is employed for identification of the precipitation-elevation
   relationship. According to relative positions of the precipitation and
   elevation SPCSVs four different precipitation categories are suggested.
   The application of the methodology proposed is presented for the
   precipitation records from Yucca Mountain, Nevada, U.S.A.}},

Abstract = {{A successive approximation linear quadratic regulator (SALQR) method is
   applied to solve estuarine management problems to determine the optimal
   amount of freshwater inflows into bays and estuaries to maximize fishery
   harvests. Fishery harvests are expressed in regression equations as
   functions of freshwater inflows. The optimization problem is posed as a
   discrete-time optimal control problem in which salinity represents the
   state variable and freshwater inflow represents the control variable. A
   two-dimensional hydrodynamic-salinity transport model, HYD-SAL, is used
   as the transition to simulate the flow circulation and temporal and
   spatial salinity pattern in an estuary system. The bound constraints for
   the control and state variables are incorporated into the objective
   function using a penalty function method to convert the problem into an
   unconstrained formulation. The SALQR method is applied to the
   Lavaca-Tres Palacios Estuary in Texas and the results are compared with
   those of using regression equations as the transition equations.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes investigations into the effects of climate change
   on flow regimes of twenty-five catchments (from 6 to 1293 km(2)) in
   central Sweden. Hydrological responses of fifteen hypothetical climate
   change scenarios (e.g. combinations of DeltaT = +1, +2 and +4 degreesC
   and DeltaP = 0, +/- 10\%, +/- 20\%) were simulated by a conceptual
   monthly water balance model. The results suggest that all the
   hypothetical climate change scenarios would cause major decreases in
   winter snow accumulation. Significant increase of winter flow and
   decrease of spring and summer runoff were resulted from most scenarios.
   Attendant changes in actual evapotranspiration were also examined for
   all climate change scenarios. Despite the changes in seasonal
   distribution of evapotranspiration, the change in annual total
   evapotranspiration was relatively small with the maximum change of 23\%
   compared with the 76\% for mean annual snow water equivalent changes and
   52\% for mean annual runoff changes. Such hydrologic results would have
   significant implications on future water resources design and
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The useful life of Tarbela reservoir, on the River Indus, is threatened
   by a sediment delta which is approaching the dam's intake tunnels; these
   lead to a hydroelectric power station and are used for irrigation
   releases. This article describes the simulated system, involving Tarbela
   Dam, with Ghazi Barotha hydropower scheme downstream, and the planned
   construction of Basha Dam upstream. This study formed an innovative
   approach which enabled the relationship between demands and supply in
   the basin to be studied, under a range of development and operating
   scenarios, and to different time horizons. A computer software package,
   `Hydro', was used to perform system simulation modelling of Tarbela Dam
   and the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan. The results enabled estimation of
   the economic benefits of several potential future operating strategies
   for Tarbela to be tested and compared. Employing the results of
   associated sediment modelling, projected storage/elevation curves were
   used to predict the irrigation and power benefits available to Pakistan
   over the coming sixty years. It was subsequently demonstrated that the
   most beneficial remedial measures are an underwater dike or dam to
   protect the intakes, and low-level flushing facilities.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology using a nonlinear optimization model is presented for
   estimating unknown magnitude, location and duration of groundwater
   pollution sources under transient flow and transport conditions. The
   proposed optimization model incorporates the governing equations of flow
   and solute transport as binding equality constraints, and thus
   essentially simulates the physical processes of transient flow and
   transient transport in the groundwater systems. The proposed inverse
   model identifies unknown sources of pollution by using measured values
   of pollutant concentration at selected locations. Performance of the
   proposed model for the identification of unknown groundwater pollution
   sources is evaluated for an illustrative study area in a hypothetical
   confined aquifer under different cases of data availability. The effect
   of observation well location vis-a-vis pollution source location on
   identification accuracy is also investigated. Performance of the
   developed identification model is also evaluated for a condition when
   concentration measurements are missing during few initial time periods
   after the pollution sources become active. The effect of specified
   initial guesses of the variable values on the optimal solutions are also
   investigated. These performance evaluation results demonstrate the
   limitations and potential applicability of the proposed optimization
   model for identifying the sources of pollution in transient groundwater
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{A national Irrigation Improvement Project (IIP) in Egypt was initiated
   in 1984 after the USAID allocated the required funds to implement the
   project in eleven command areas. Since then, the project has been
   extended to other areas, among which is El-Mahmoudia area of 280,000
   Feddans (117,600 ha). This study aims at investigating the major
   expected impacts of the project and to highlight any recommendations
   and/or measures to be taken before, during, and after its
   implementation. A key element to implement such study was the
   development of a numerical approach, capable of quantifying the
   unrecorded re-circulated irrigation water, so that the water balance can
   be adjusted accordingly. The calculations have shown that the project
   has minimal effect on two major drains and consequently on their
   intercepting lakes. The developed approach has represented a simple and
   practical tool to implement a reasonable evaluation of different
   scenarios for the project future impacts.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, a fuzzy rule based model is developed for the operation
   of a single purpose reservoir. The model operates on an `if - then'
   principle, where the `if' is a vector of fuzzy premises and the `then'
   is a vector of fuzzy consequences. The steps involved in the development
   of the model include, construction of membership functions for the
   inflow, storage, demand and the release, formulation of fuzzy rules,
   implication and defuzzification. The methodology is illustrated through
   the case study of the Malaprabha irrigation reservoir in Karnataka,
   India. Reservoir storage, inflow, and demands are used as premises and
   the release as the consequence. Simulated reservoir operation with a
   steady state policy provides the knowledge base necessary for the
   formulation of the Fuzzy rules.}},

Abstract = {{Past and the present studies show that the Canadian Prairies have become
   warmer and may have been drier in the last four to five decades but the
   drying trends are scattered and inconclusive. Statistical analysis shows
   that only the Winter and Fall (in some instances) precipitation is
   marginally related to ENSO and the PNA (Pacific North Americ) Index, and
   streamflow is highly variable. With uncertainties on the potential
   impact of climatic change and other uncertainties, several strategies
   are proposed to reduce the vulnerability of the Prairies to future
   droughts, where surface water is the primary water supply and
   agriculture is the major water user: (1) Continue implementing
   small-scale water resources projects and increase water storage through
   snow management, (2) increase integration between existing water
   resources systems, and (3) promote water conservation measures in
   agriculture practice, water pricing and water metering.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the relationship between U.K. water companies'
   perceptions of past climatic extremes and their effect on resilience to
   future climatic change is explored. Perceptions and activities related
   to past and future dry periods was investigated through interviews with
   managers at the ten major English and Welsh water supply/sewerage
   companies, and several smaller, water-only companies. Several of the
   companies report that they have observed a trend towards drier summers
   in their regions, and a number of companies say that they have observed
   a change towards more intensive rainfall of shorter duration. Recent
   supply measures in a number of regions have been aimed at improving
   storage and distribution related to the perceived change in rainfall
   intensity. A new requirement to incorporate regional climate change
   scenarios in future supply assumptions appears to have had little impact
   on planning in the region to date. Many water resource planners believe
   that the scenarios generated are too aggregated and do not encourage a
   precautionary approach to planning. Some managers believe that records
   of historical drought conditions, such as experienced in 1933/1934 or
   1995/1996, as worst-case scenarios provide a better basis for planning.}},

Abstract = {{Though the minimum area section is generally adopted for lined canals,
   it is not the best section as it does not involve lining cost, and the
   cost of earthwork which varies with the excavation depth. On account of
   complexities of analysis, the minimum cost design of lined canal
   sections has not been attempted as yet. In this investigation, explicit
   equations and section shape coefficients for the design variables of
   minimum cost lined canal sections for triangular, rectangular,
   trapezoidal, and circular shapes have been obtained by applying the
   nonlinear optimization technique. Application of the proposed design
   equations along with the tabulated section shape coefficients results
   directly in the optimal dimensions of a lined canal without going
   through the conventional trial and error method of canal design. The
   optimal cost equation along with the corresponding section shape
   coefficients is useful during the planning of a canal project.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology is presented in this article for computing the optimal
   operation of soil aquifer treatment systems. The mathematical problem is
   stated as a discrete-time optimal control problem to maximize
   infiltration subject to various physical and operation constraints. The
   methodology is based upon solving the discrete-time optimal control
   problem using a successive approximation linear quadratic regulator
   interfaced with a simulator. The unsaturated flow model HYDRUS is
   modified to simulate the water content distribution, the infiltration
   process, and the draining process. A penalty function method is used to
   treat the bound constraints on the water content and the cycle time.
   Sample problems are given to illustrate the capability of the model to
   solve the optimal operation of soil aquifer treatment systems.}},

Abstract = {{The advantage of using insurance to help a farmer adopt a best nitrogen
   management plan (BNMP) that reduces the impact of agricultural
   production on the environment is analytically and empirically
   demonstrated. Using an expected value analysis, it is shown that an
   insurance program can be structured so as to reduce a farmer's cost of
   bearing the adoption risk associated with changing production practices
   and, thus, to improve the farmer's certainty equivalent net return
   thereby promoting the adoption of a BNMP. Using the adoption of
   growing-season only N fertilizer application in Iowa as a case study, it
   is illustrated how insurance may be used to promote the adoption of this
   practice to reduce N fertilizer use. It is shown that it is possible for
   a farmer and an insurance company both to have an incentive to develop
   an insurance adoption program that will benefit both the farmer and the
   insurance company, increasing net social welfare and improving

Abstract = {{One of the critical problems that hinders the sustainable development in
   the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries is the lack of renewable
   water resources. Rainfall in the Arabian Peninsula is scarce and
   infrequent. Over-exploitation of fossil groundwater resources, mostly to
   meet the irrigation demands and create greenery lands, has already
   affected the aquifer's productivity both quantitatively and
   qualitatively. A great portion of the freshwater demands in the GCC
   countries is covered by desalinated water. Recently, after the Gulf war
   and uncertainty of oil prices, the expansion in the construction of
   desalination plants may not be economically feasible. This article
   investigates the water availability and assesses the water demands in
   the GCC countries. It emphasizes the need for the adaptation of an
   efficient and integrated policy for water utilization and application of
   relevant conservation techniques in various water consumption sectors.
   Water of higher quality should be preserved for drinking purposes and
   should not be utilized for other purposes that may tolerate water of
   lower quality. Recycling of water and artificial recharge of groundwater
   by surface water and treated wastewater should be adapted at a larger
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{Surface water reservoirs can be classified as either within-year or
   over-year based on the duration of their critical period (CP). In
   general, within-year systems are those which will refill and spill
   several times in a year, whereas over-year systems have much longer
   critical periods, usually of the order of years. If the duration of the
   critical period, and hence the precise mode of behaviour, of a reservoir
   were to be known a priori, then advantage could be taken of this to
   select the level of detail required for reservoir analysis. For example,
   if the reservoir system is purely over-year, i.e. the CP is much longer
   than 12 months, then only annual streamflow data are required for
   analysis. On the contrary, systems which exhibit dual within-year and
   over-year behaviours will require time series data of a finer resolution
   to capture both the seasonal and annual discrepancies between the demand
   and inflow. Such a consideration often results in a phenomenal increase
   in the analysis time over that required for annual data. Finally, if the
   system is purely within-year, then the analysis effort can be
   significantly reduced by concentrating on the critical or driest year of
   the record. In this paper, we examine the properties of the test in
   current use for distinguishing between within-year and over-year
   behaviours. In particular we investigate how the parameter of the test
   is related to the CP, and we argue that knowing the CP is a more
   complete test. We then develop predictive equations for the CP and we
   offer suggestions for extending the study.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a methodology for planning a model for the
   operation of a drinking water reservoir. The hedging rule distributes
   deficits over a longer period of time by rationing the supply of water
   and it makes the system sustainable with a marginal reduction in supply.
   A methodology is developed and demonstrated through a case study with
   the Chennai city (India) water supply system which is a water shortage
   system requiring an efficient use of water. It is aimed at improving the
   reservoir operation performance through the simulation-optimisation
   procedure with the application of the hedging rule, which is a more
   appropriate rule for reservoir operation under deficit conditions. To
   speed up the optimisation process, a neural network model is developed
   for the simulation of the reservoir system operation and is used instead
   of a conventional simulation model. The combined neural network
   simulation-optimisation model is used for screening the operation
   policies.}},

Abstract = {{Reliability programming formulations offer a family of explicit
   stochastic models for planning the operation of complex water resources
   systems. These models use cumulative probability distributions of the
   sum of inflows to characterize their variability in the planning period.
   Applicability of these models for a variety of problems has been
   limited, mainly due to the assumption of independence between inflows in
   different time periods that leads to the derivation of conservative
   operating policies. This paper presents three new approaches to overcome
   this limitation. The performance of the proposed approaches is
   demonstrated through comparison of the operating policies derived from
   these approaches and the Independent Approach. Operational planning of
   the Manitoba Hydro energy generation system, a predominantly hydro-based
   utility company in Manitoba (Canada), is used as the case study.}},

Abstract = {{The Konan groundwater basin of Kochi Prefecture, Japan, is experiencing
   freshwater shortages for the past few years, particularly during the
   winter season. The present study aimed at analyzing the problem and
   exploring increased groundwater withdrawals to meet burgeoning
   freshwater demands in various sectors. The trend analysis of water
   consumption indicates that the groundwater demand would increase by 43
   and 52\% by the years 2010 and 2025, respectively, compared to 32 100
   m(3) d(-1) at present. The streamflow of the Monobe River reduces to a
   minimum in winter and it shows a decreasing trend in recent years. The
   geologic investigation results indicate that unconfined (phreatic)
   aquifers comprising alluvial sand and gravel and/or diluvial silty sand
   and gravel are dominant, and that the northwestern and western portions
   of the basin have greater potential for groundwater. Groundwater flows
   essentially from north to south into the ocean. Groundwater level
   fluctuations over the basin vary appreciably in space and time,
   indicating a wide variation of natural recharge. Field observations
   confirm the hypothesis that stream-aquifer interaction also
   significantly contributes to groundwater recharge, besides the rainfall
   infiltration. Further, the pumping tests results demonstrate that though
   the aquifers are low-yielding, enhanced groundwater withdrawals could be
   possible. The aquifer hydraulic conductivity is characterized as high
   and ranges from 65 to 804 m d(-1) (mean = 229 m d(-1)), thereby
   suggesting great aquifer heterogeneity. Finally, it is concluded that
   the long-term sustainability of the scarce groundwater resource of the
   Konan basin is doubtful, and that a comprehensive analysis of the
   groundwater system is essential prior to formulating plans for the
   future groundwater development and management.}},

Abstract = {{A feedback method of control has been used to develop a model for
   optimal determination of freshwater inflow to bays and estuaries. A
   modification of the feedback method of control was implemented which
   makes the technique applicable to certain constrained optimal control
   problems. The modified feedback model for estuary management consists of
   a hydrodynamic-transport salinity model, HYD-SAL, coupled to a dynamic
   programming optimization model. The constraints of the model are the
   monthly freshwater inflows and the salinities. A quadratic criterion
   representing a weighted sum of squared deviations from target salinity
   and freshwater level is chosen as the objective function. The
   constrained optimal control algorithm employs a penalty function that
   uses a similar quadratic criterion as the objective function. This
   algorithm has performed efficiently for computing the optimal freshwater
   inflows into the Lavaca-Tres Palacios Estuary in Texas while satisfying
   the freshwater requirements for other components in the system.}},

Abstract = {{A stochastic optimization approach is presented for the remediation
   design of a contaminated aquifer with limited hydrogeologic information.
   Stochastic simulation using the Monte Carlo technique, produces a series
   of equally probable realisations of the spatially varying random
   hydraulic conductivity field. The stochastic flow and transport
   simulation model is coupled, using the response matrix approach, with a
   nonlinear optimization algorithm. The whole process is integrated into
   an algorithm which is effectively applied in the case study of the
   Kalamaria aquifer, Chalkidiki, Greece. The stochastic optimization
   procedure is followed by a reliability analysis, giving useful
   information to the decision makers concerning the effectiveness of the
   optimal results.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of parameter estimation constitutes the largest obstacle to
   successful application of conceptual catchment models in ungauged
   catchments. This paper investigates the usefulness of a conceptual water
   balance model for simulating river flow from catchments covering a wide
   variety of climatic and physiographic areas. The model is a 6-parameter
   water balance model which was applied to 26 seasonally snow covered
   catchments in central Sweden. The model was calibrated on a group of
   catchments and the calibrated parameter values related to physical
   catchment indices. The relationships were tested by comparing observed
   and simulated runoff records from 4 catchments that were not contained
   in the regression analysis. The results show that the model can be
   satisfactorily applied to ungauged basins in the study region. In order
   to test the physical relevance of the model to a wider set of
   conditions, the model was modified by excluding the snow routine part.
   The resulting model and the same technique were tested on 24 catchments
   taken from northern Belgium. The verification results were found to be
   satisfactory.}},

Abstract = {{This case study describes the application of the Freeze et al. (1991)
   decision analysis approach to design an artificial recharge program for
   a basin, known in Jordan as Yarmouk Basin. This approach of design was
   selected because it suits projects in which the hydrogeological
   environment plays an important role; and because the approach to design
   involves quantifying benefits, costs, and risks for recharge
   alternatives under consideration. Risk, which is added here, is defined
   as the expected costs of failure. It reflects both performance
   uncertainties and failure costs. Probability of failure to attain a
   prescribed drawdown at each of the compliance points was estimated by
   coupling a parameter uncertainty model with a groundwater flow
   simulation model and a reliability model. The simulations were based on
   an ensemble of thirty realizations of hydraulic conductivity field which
   were generated by a parameter uncertainty model after assuming the
   hydraulic conductivity field log-normally distributed spatially.
   Finally, the decision between alternatives was made by a decision making
   model which considers both the costs and risks. Decision variables
   consist of the number, location, and recharge rate of the injection
   wells. The results showed how the preferred design alternative depends
   upon the hydrogeological, and economic considerations. Moreover, the
   preferred alternative under the adopted criteria for recharge was found
   less sensitive to the cost of failure, but highly dependent upon the
   total cost of the system.}},

Abstract = {{It is increasingly clear that there is a need to assist National
   Hydrological Agencies in Africa to improve their hydrometric data
   collection capabilities and at the same time to halt the decline in
   hydrometric standards. This has to be achieved in a cost-effective and
   sustainable way and, at the same time reinforce existing systems with
   new technology and equipment and strengthen the institution capacity of
   these agencies. The Southern African Development Community-Hydrological
   Cycle Observation System (SADC-HYCOS) will provide the framework,
   methodologies and tools to achieve this goal. This paper provides the
   first opportunity to inform the global hydrological community of the
   aims and activities of the SADC-HYCOS project. Significant advances will
   be made in the installation of real time data collection platforms and
   transmission system, the development and implementation of a regional
   database, the improvement and/or development of data exchange and
   dissemination systems using a regional electronic network and Internet
   links, the development of hydrometeorological products from the database
   and establishing a large scale training programme relating to activities
   during the life-time of the project.
   SADC-HYCOS will promote the collection, processing and exchange of
   hydrological data and information within the region and raise the
   profile of the regional hydrological issues, hydrological research,
   operational hydrology, availability of data and information to a global

Abstract = {{A new approach is developed for the automatic (computer based)
   exploration and analysis of hydrological data, particularly focused on
   the identification of shifting relationships among hydrological
   variables. The methodology developed is applicable to many hydrological
   problems, such as identification of multiple stage-discharge
   relationships in a river section, data homogeneity analysis, analysis of
   temporal consistency of hydrological data, detection of outliers, and
   determination of shifts and trends in hydrological time series. Such
   problems are examined here as particular applications of the single
   methodology developed. A general mathematical representation of the data
   exploration problem is initially proposed, based on set theory
   considerations. Several statistical tests, as well as auxiliary
   information of physical conditions, are systematically combined to form
   an objective function to be optimised. This objective function
   represents the performance of a solution, (where a solution is a
   specific partitioning of a data set into subperiods), in a manner, that
   holds in each subperiod a single relationship among data values. It is
   shown that an exhaustive search of all candidate solutions is
   intractable. Therefore, a heuristic algorithm is proposed, which
   emulates the exploratory data analysis of the human expert. This
   algorithm encodes a number of search strategies in a pattern directed
   computer program and results in an automatic determination of a
   satisfactory solution.}},

Abstract = {{Aquifer systems play an essential role in meeting the ever increasing
   use of water for different purposes. Proper design and management of
   such systems should therefore be a very important matter of concern, not
   only to ensure that water will be available in adequate quantity (and
   quality) to satisfy demands but also to guarantee that this would be
   done in an optimal manner.
   This paper presents a model serving to define which water supply
   structures (especially pumping equipment and pipes) should be installed
   in order to minimize the sum of set-up costs and operation costs while
   satisfying demands, using a heuristic approach based on simulated
   annealing. Annealing algorithms are random local search optimization
   algorithms that allow, at least in theory and in probability, the

Abstract = {{Watershed runoff modelling techniques were developed and applied for

   possible changes in temperature and precipitation caused by increases in
   atmospheric trace-gas concentrations could have major impacts on both
   the timing and magnitude of runoff and soil moisture in important
   natural resources areas. Of particular importance are predicted patterns
   of summer soil-moisture drying that are consistent across the entire
   range of tested scenarios. The decreases in summer soil moisture range
   from 10 to 50\% for different scenarios. In addition, consistent changes
   were observed in the timing of runoff - specifically dramatic increases
   in winter runoff and decreases in summer runoff. These hydrologic
   results raise the possibility of major environmental and socio-economic
   difficulties and they will have significant implications for future

Abstract = {{A competitive irrigated agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley of
   California, under semiarid to arid climate and repetitive drought
   conditions, relies on groundwater resources to a great extent. As a
   result of rapid agricultural development and intense operation of ground
   water resources over the years, the Valley has been exposed to severe
   land subsidence and pesticide and fertilizer induced ground water
   contamination problems. In this paper, based on historical drought
   recurrences in the region, a model of aridity quantification and
   climatic scenario for the period 2000-2030 is described. Moreover, a
   schematic economics model is set up to analyze the potential benefits
   from artificially recharging the underlying aquifer nearby the San
   Joaquin River, as compared to the ongoing management plans in the
   Valley. The approach presented in this paper is based on cost assessment
   simulation and employs weighting coefficients instead of marketing
   prices. For the climatic scenario considered in this paper, the
   comparative benefit-cost analysis reveals significant benefits from
   artificially recharging the aquifer adjacent to the San Joaquin River.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{The Chalk aquifer of the English South Downs is very heavily utilised.
   The groundwater resources have enjoyed a formal programme of management
   which started in the 1950s, although a number of actions had been taken
   earlier in order to deal with saline intrusion and potential risk to
   groundwater quality from urbanisation. In the late 1950s the policy of
   `leakage/storage' boreholes was first adopted, whereby the `leakage'
   boreholes along the coast were pumped in winter to intercept fresh water
   discharge to the sea and to maximise the recharge potential inland, and
   inland `storage' boreholes were used, as much as possible, in the summer
   months only. A comprehensive monitoring programme supported by aquifer
   modelling has enabled a gradual increase in overall abstraction to take
   place without increasing groundwater degradation due to saline
   intrusion. There have been various pollution prevention strategies over
   the years, and these have been effective in protecting the groundwater
   despite the high population density and widespread agricultural activity
   within the South Downs. The management of the aquifer has clearly been
   successful; there are many lessons from this experience that can be
   applied to other regions and other aquifers.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Planning for sustainable development of water resources relies crucially
   on the data available. Continuous hydrologic simulation based on
   conceptual models has proved to be the appropriate tool for studying
   rainfall-runoff processes and for providing necessary data. In recent
   years, artificial neural networks have emerged as a novel identification
   technique for the modelling of hydrological processes. However, they
   represent their knowledge in terms of a weight matrix that is not
   accessible to human understanding at present. This paper introduces
   genetic programming, which is an evolutionary computing method that
   provides a `transparent' and structured system identification, to
   rainfall-runoff modelling. The genetic-programming approach is applied
   to flow prediction for the Kirkton catchment in Scotland (U.K.). The
   results obtained are compared to those attained using two optimally
   calibrated conceptual models and an artificial neural network.
   Correlations identified using data-driven approaches (genetic
   programming and neural network) are surprising in their consistency
   considering the relative size of the models and the number of variables
   included. These results also compare favourably with the conceptual
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Relations among spectral reflectance, chlorophyll `a', and growth of
   rice plants grown on irrigated light textured soil in a semi arid region
   are presented here. There was a linear relation between spectral
   reflectance and rice plant height (r = 0.97), for band 1 (0.45-0.52 mu
   m) reflectance values. On the other hand, in bands 2 (0.52-0.60 mu m)
   and 3 (0.63-0.69 mu m), reflectance values decreased until 70 days after
   planting (DAP) and then increased during the reproductive phase of the
   crop. The near infrared band 4 (0.76-0.90 mu m) showed a maximum
   reflectance at 59 DAP (panicle initiation stage) and a decline in
   reflectance thereafter through maturity.
   The peak value of IR/R ratio was 16.39 at 62 DAP during the early
   reproductive phase; thereafter, it declines gradually with the maturity
   of the crop. Chlorophyll `a' concentration was high during early growth
   (vegetative and early reproductive stages) and decreased during the
   flowering and maturity stages. The rice plant canopy show a high
   chlorophyll `a' concentration at 64 and 59 DAP for sites A and B,
   respectively. Chlorophyll `a' concentration is higher in site A plant
   canopies than it is in site B during the entire crop cycle. A good
   inverse correlation (r = 0.91) has been found between chlorophyll `a'
   and band 1, while the IR/R ratio and the normalised difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) showed a relationship (r = 0.78) with the
   chlorophyll `a' concentration during the crop cycle. Band 2, 3 and 4
   radiance values show a biphasic linear relationship with chlorophyll `a'
   concentrations, negative for early growth and positive for flowering and
   maturity stages.
   Results indicate that the period between 66 to 70 DAP is most suitable
   for the assessment of rice crop yield, based on chlorophyll `a'
   concentration.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach is taken to the problem of estimating global water
   scarcity, using a realistic and consistent procedure applied across many
   countries. Water demands, surface flows and groundwater availability are
   estimated on a gridded basis, and various water availability indices are
   derived comparing the resource with the projected demand. Surface flows
   are estimated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model linking climate
   to runoff and, in the major river basins, the runoff estimates for
   individual grid cells are accumulated to give estimates for the total
   flows at all points of interest. Groundwater availability is derived
   from hydrogeological maps based on estimates of the potential yield that
   can be expected from a borehole and the likely maximum borehole density.
   Estimates of potential groundwater recharge derived from the surface
   water model are also taken into account. Water demands are based on
   current and projected population and livestock numbers, and information
   on irrigation schemes and industrial water use. Results are presented
   for the application of the model to a region covering the whole of
   eastern and southern Africa. The main scenario considered includes the
   combined impact of climate change, population growth and improved living
   standards to the year 2050. The results for this scenario show that
   water scarcity is likely to increase in many countries in the region,
   with particular problems in the countries around Lake Victoria and in
   the southernmost parts of the pilot region.}},

Abstract = {{Some of the most critical flood problems occur in urban areas where
   values at risk are higher and damages tend to be heavier. Fast urban
   developing regions raise very specific problems because of the unsteady
   situation of these regions in terms of catchment land-use and urban
   encroachment. A realistic approach to flood management in these
   situations requires the consideration of urban growth scenarios and the
   simulation of the corresponding flood conditions. Coastal towns are
   frequently located in floodplains and are subject to flood hazard. This
   is the case for many coastal areas in Southern Europe that are still
   developing fast due to migration of the population to these areas. In
   such cases, flood management cannot be dissociated from land-use
   management, and non-structural measures for flood control can play a
   crucial role. It is important to make an ex-post evaluation of these
   types of measures in areas where they have been adopted. These issues
   are addressed in two Portuguese catchments, representative of urban
   growth and related to flood problems in Portugal and other Southern
   European regions. The Laje catchment is used for the ex-post evaluation
   of nonstructural measures, and the Livramento catchment is used for the
   modelling of urban growth scenarios. Quantitative results and policy
   recommendations are presented based on these two case-studies.
   Floodplain management is better done with GIS, especially if it is
   linked to hydrologic and hydraulic modelling capabilities. The use of
   GIS for conducting these studies is presented in Part II of this
   article.}},

Abstract = {{In Part I of this article the very dynamic nature of floodplain
   management was discussed and the need for modelling the urban growth
   processes and formulating scenarios of urban development was emphasised.
   In this second part, the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for
   addressing those problems is presented. GIS have been recognised as a
   powerful means to integrate and analyse data from various sources in the
   context of comprehensive floodplain management. Adequate information and
   prediction capability is vital to evaluate alternative scenarios for
   flood mitigation policies and to improve decision making processes
   associated with flood management. A framework for the comprehensive
   evaluation of flood hazard management policies is also addressed in this
   article. This comprehensive approach to flood problems is more than an
   attitude or a philosophical starting point. It makes use of specific
   technological tools conceived to be used by different actors, some of
   them being nonexperts in flood analysis. These tools, based on GIS, are
   very appropriate for a participatory approach to flood policy
   formulation and floodplain management because they help communicating
   with the public in a scientifically correct and yet rather simple
   manner.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aiming towards rational irrigation water management in a seasonally dry
   climate, sorghum water losses via evapotranspiration were studied during
   a two-year experiment in relation to irrigation treatments in Central
   Greece. Relative to high irrigation (I-H), that provided the root depth
   with 458 mm of water in 1994 and 512 mm in 1995, 56 and 64\% of the
   water was supplied by the medium (I-M) and 34 and 46\% by the low (I-L)
   treatments, respectively, during the two years. A fourth treatment
   (I-HA) was performed like (I-H) until the end of anthesis, when
   irrigation stopped. Gravimetric soil moisture was measured, biometric
   measurements were taken and all meteorological parameters required to
   estimate evapotranspiration by the Penman-Monteith equation were logged.
   A model estimating sorghum actual water loss was first run with the 1994
   data. During the model-establishment year, it was found that (a) surface
   resistance r(s), consisting of a canopy r(sc) and a soil r(ss)
   resistance acting in parallel, was almost exclusively dependent on soil
   water shortage, (b) under the I-M and I-L irrigation treatments, the
   lowest possible (immediately after water application) canopy resistance
   r(sc)', higher than the (I-H) minimum canopy resistance r(sc) (min) = 40
   sm(-1), was irrigation-deficit dependent and (c) the r(ss) (min) was as
   high as 1200 sm(-1), common to all treatments.
   The model established was then verified with the 1995 data and used to
   calculate the crop coefficient k(c) values for sorghum. The model,
   although tending to underestimate actual evapotranspiration by 4-10\%,
   depending on the treatment, may be considered as reliable. The k(c)
   values calculated are considerably higher than the k(c) values suggested
   for sorghum by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Therefore,
   taking also into account that any additional mm of water supplied
   results in an increase of 0.052 t of dry biomass per hectare, higher
   irrigation water applications could be recommended, although the low
   irrigation treatment made slightly better use of water.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of limited predictability is reviewed followed by simple
   examples illustrating the sensitivity to small changes in the initial
   state and/or the forcing of a nonlinear system. Limited predictability
   applies to almost all nonlinear systems, and the concept is therefore
   important to geophysical systems governed by nonlinear model equations.
   The limited predictability determines the upper limit to operational
   weather forecasts, but it will also be demonstrated that it has an
   impact on the determination of the effect of changes in the forcing of
   the system.
   The general strategy applied by researchers to estimate the atmospheric
   greenhouse effect is reviewed. It will be demonstrated that the adopted
   strategy, due to prescribed changes in the forcing of the climate
   system, is also influenced by limited predictability in the sense that
   predicted changes are much larger than observed changes in the
   temperatures at the surface of the Earth. It is therefore very unlikely
   that the predictions are reliable.
   The inclusion of the sulphuraerosol effect is also discussed with the
   conclusion that although these cooling agents reduce greenhouse warming,
   they do not behave as expected in the sulphurrich and sulphurpoor
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion and transport of mass in a fracture network is a percolation
   process. Macroscale dispersion is related to travel time, distance, mass
   distribution and fracture geometry. This article presents a stochastic,
   discrete fracture model in conjunction with percolation theory to
   investigate the dispersion phenomenon and the power law relationship
   between mean square travel paths displacement < r(2)> and particle
   travel time t. For imposed boundary conditions, particle dispersion is
   simulated to observe percolation thresholds and dispersion trends in
   different network structures. Simulation results demonstrate that the
   critical exponent values of t in the percolated networks are extremely
   close to the theoretical value of 1.27 and occur at certain percolation
   factors. Below these percolation factors, the exponents of t increase
   with decreasing percolation factors, above these percolation factors,
   exponents decrease with increasing percolation factors. In our simulated
   cases, the proportionality between < r(2)> and time t is given by t
   raised to a power between 1.27 and 1.66, depending on the fracture
   pattern. The coefficient of anisotropic dispersion tensor increases with
   increasing distance. The percolation process is related to travel time
   and distance, and cannot be interpreted as a Fickian diffusive process.}},

Abstract = {{A unique integrated modelling system has been developed and applied for
   environmental assessment studies in connection with the Gabcikovo
   hydropower scheme along the Danube. The modelling system integrates
   model codes for describing the reservoir (2D flow, eutrophication,
   sediment transport), the river and river branches (1D flow including
   effects of hydraulic control structures, water quality, sediment
   transport), the ground water (3D flow, solute transport, geochemistry),
   agricultural aspects (crop yield, irrigation, nitrogen leaching) and
   flood plain conditions (dynamics of inundation pattern, ground water and
   soil moisture conditions, and water quality). The uniqueness of the
   established modelling system is the integration between the individual
   model codes, each of which provides complex descriptions of the various
   processes. The validation tests have generally been carried out for the
   individual models, whereas only a few tests on the integrated model were
   possible. Based on discussion and examples, it is concluded that the
   results from the integrated model can be assumed less uncertain than
   outputs from the individual model components. In an example, the impacts
   of the Gabcikovo scheme on the ecologically unique wetlands created by
   the river branch system downstream of the new reservoir have been
   simulated. In this case, the impacts of alternative water management
   scenarios on ecologically important factors such as flood frequency and
   duration, depth of flooding, depth to ground water table, capillary
   rise, flow velocities, sedimentation and water quality in the river
   system have been explicitly calculated.}},

   the spatio-temporal variation of the water table in an aquifer system in
   response to time-varying recharge applied through a rectangular basin.
   The recharge function is approximated by introducing a number of line

   by using finite Fourier sine transform and its application is

Abstract = {{Waterlogging is becoming a serious problem in irrigated command areas of
   India. The study area is the Sriram Sagar command, which is about 120 km
   north of Hyderabad. An attempt has been made to make an assessment of
   the waterlogged area and those areas sensitive to waterlogging during
   the pre and post monsoon periods in the Sriram Sagar command using
   remorely sensed and field data.
   Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-1A-LISS-II) digital data (Computer
   Compatible Tapes) of 12 April and 6 October 1989, were analysed to
   assess the areas affected by waterlogging and those areas sensitive to
   waterlogging. The validation of the IRS-derived waterlogged areas, was
   done using available water table depth data and other field information.
   The results obtained from this study indicate that in April and October
   1989, areas of some 388 and 540 km(2) were waterlogged and about 698 and
   802 km(2), respectively, were sensitive to waterlogging (where the water
   table lies between 1 to 2 m, respectively, below the ground surface. It
   is suggested that periodic assessment of waterlogging, using remotely
   sensed data, should be carried out in the Sriram Sagar command.
   The IRS data have been proved to be very succesful for the assessment of
   waterlogging. Density slicing and principal component analysis are
   useful techniques in making an assessment of waterlogged areas in
   irrigated command areas.}},

Abstract = {{We have evaluated the extent of public concerns about water management
   in the Palestinian Territory (PT) through a survey of the main
   Palestinian newspaper over the last thirteen years divided in three
   periods: pre (1984-1987), during (1988-1991), and post national uprising
   period (1992-1996). The public concern in the PT about various water
   management aspects was clear and influenced by the prevailing political
   conditions indicating (1) poor concerns in the first and second period
   where full Israeli military control of the PT and harsh practices
   prevailed with relatively more emphasis on regional water issues and (2)
   extensive-strong concerns in the third period when the peace process
   started and a partial lift of some of the Israeli water practices took
   place, along with an increased freedom in expressing public concerns
   which was granted with more emphasis on local issues and problems. Lack
   and limitation of water available to Palestinians, alternative
   solutions, and water quality and pollution control constituted the
   overwhelming majority of the topics of concern to the public for the
   three periods studied. Palestinian concerns were always greater than
   regional ones for the three periods and all of the topics considered.
   Public concern in the PT about all other water management aspects was
   poor and negligible especially in the first two periods. A massive
   increase in public concern has been observed in the third period in
   which the public expressed their concern over most water management
   aspects, indicating a possible change in public attitude toward water
   and water management and reflecting the change of the political status
   by the start of the peace process and the signing of the peace
   agreements.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic algorithm (GA) is a nonconventional search technique which
   is patterned after the biological processes of natural selection and
   evolution. It has the ability to search large and complex decision
   spaces and handle nonconvexities. In this paper, the genetic algorithm
   is investigated and applied to solve the optimal operation problem of
   soil aquifer treatment (SAT) systems. This problem involves finding
   optimal water application time and drying time which maximize
   infiltration for a predetermined starting influent rate of waste water
   and subject to various physical and operational constraints. A new
   scaling method is developed and some improvements on the evolution
   procedure are presented. A comprehensive GA-SAT computer model was
   developed and applied to an example SAT problem. The results are
   encouraging, when compared with using the successive approximation
   linear quadratic regulator algorithm. It was found that genetic
   algorithms are easy to program and interface with large complicated
   simulators.}},

Abstract = {{The application of a link-node model in modeling hydrodynamics of
   wetland areas related to flood detention design is presented through the
   description of modeling and design efforts of an actual project, the
   first privately-owned wetland mitigation bank in Florida. The 142-ha
   project is located in the Chapel Trail Preserve of the City of Pembroke
   Pines, South Florida, where a degraded site is transformed into a
   healthy, self-sustaining wetland ecosystem. Creation of the wetlands,
   located adjacent to an existing development, required careful evaluation
   of drainage conditions. To properly design the wetland site, a
   hydrodynamic model was developed which allowed sizing of hydraulic
   structures and computation of maximum water surface elevations. The
   paper presents model description and calibration using field data,
   parameter sensitivity, general application in the project and use as a
   design tool. The model was found to be a valuable tool that can be
   applied in similar projects.}},

Abstract = {{Two methods widely used in agrometeorogical simulation models for
   describing field soil water regimes are compared and evaluated based on
   their ability to predict experimental data from a single field study.
   The first method is based on a numerical solution to the Richards'
   equation for describing water movement in the soil profile, while the
   second method is based on soil-water capacity terms. The evaluation of
   the performance of the two methods is based on goodness-of-fit
   statistics and graphical analysis. Results indicate that the first
   method is more accurate for both the upper and the lower soil zones; the
   second method, despite its low performance in the upper soil zone can
   adequately describe soil moisture conditions in the lower soil zones.
   Recommendations are made for model use based on comparison results, the
   intended model use, and the difficulty in the acquisition of required
   model inputs.}},

Abstract = {{The Piracicaba river basin is a subtropical watershed located in the
   southeastern region of Brazil. With an area of 12 400 km(2), the basin
   is a typical example of new landscape resulting from development in
   tropical and sub-tropical regions: establishment of intensive industrial
   and agricultural processes were followed by significant population
   growth and water management. This scenario has led to significant
   increase in water demand and decrease in water quality. The main
   objective of this study is the detection of changes in the patterns of
   flow and precipitation in the basin, and its possible relation to
   man-induced changes. Statistical analyses were performed on records of
   precipitation, evapotranspiration and streamflow, from 1947 to 1991.
   Precipitation and evapotranspiration totals showed significant
   increasing trends for the entire basin. From eight streamflow gauge
   stations, half showed significant decreasing trend. The most probable
   cause of such trends is the export of water from the basin to the
   metropolitan region of Sao Paulo city.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the pattern of occurrence of peak runoff events is valuable
   for managing activities in watercourses and their environs. Current
   approaches consider the inter-arrival intervals between events as being
   exponentially distributed with a fixed seasonal parameter. In a new
   approach (Ben-Zvi and Meirovich, Stochastic Hydrology and Hydraulics,
   1997) the occurrence day is considered as a random variable to whose
   series a gradually-varied distribution, such as the normal or Pearson
   III function, can be fitted. The statistical moments of occurrence days
   facilitate such fits. The present work extends the consideration, via a
   case study of partial duration series, to the occurrence times of
   high-discharge events. The first three statistical moments of occurrence
   days in series of runoff peaks have been determined for a sample of nine
   hydrometric stations in Israel. The mean occurrence day of high peaks at
   eight stations falls earlier than that of respective low peaks, whilst
   for one station the opposite trend is observed. The shifts at five
   stations are found statistically significant. The standard deviations of
   occurrence days in partial duration series for the sample stations are
   mostly shorter than those in the respective complete series of events.
   The occurrence days of runoff events in the complete series at seven
   stations are about evenly distributed around their respective mean,
   whereas most of the other occurrence series are skewed.}},

Abstract = {{With growing concerns for sustainable development world over, planners
   of natural resources are focussing their attention on vulnerability
   arising from availability and use of water resources. Past studies of
   water resource vulnerability have either been too aggregate, or have
   focussed on one single dimension of these issues. This study presents a
   comprehensive analysis of global (using national scope) water
   resource-based vulnerability (WRV) using a joint criteria of water
   availability and its relative use. Vulnerability status for each country
   was assessed for the present (1990) situation, as well as for the year
   2025. Four factors were taken into account to determine the nature of
   the WRV for a country: population growth, food self-sufficiency,
   industrial development, and climate change. World population growth,
   which is projected to increase to 8.45 billion people by the year 2025,
   by itself would trigger 40\% of the population residing in countries
   facing some degree of WRV. Combined with food self-sufficiency,
   industrial growth, and climate change, by the year 2025, some 5.1
   billion (60\% of the total world population) would live in regions
   potentially experiencing moderate to extreme WRV. The study suggests
   that the regions that are at great risk are those already facing some
   degree of WRV; the climate change would most likely accentuate the
   already worsening situation in many regions, while improve it in regions
   that are not projected to be vulnerable.}},

Abstract = {{The understanding of how people evaluate and respond to natural hazards
   in an urban area, and how this knowledge can be integrated in the
   planning and management process, are becoming very important elements of
   a comprehensive and participatory approach to flood hazard management.
   Such an approach demands a clear comprehension of the processes of the
   risks perception, causal attribution, possible solutions for the problem
   and patterns of behaviour developed during hazard situations. The
   willingness of the public to participate in flood management, and the
   attitudes to previous initiatives also need to be addressed. The
   provision of structural flood defences can have a major impact on the
   environment and there has been an expression of concern by many members
   of the public for the degradation of river corridors. In this context,
   it is becoming a commonly accepted practice by central or local
   governments to submit flood management plans to public discussion.
   Appropriate techniques for interfacing with the public are necessary to
   support this upsurge of public involvement. This paper presents results
   from research on public perception of floods, flood management and
   participatory initiatives in Setubal, Portugal. An extensive interview
   programme was undertaken with residents and shopkeepers - with and
   without flood experience, professionals responsible for dealing with
   flood control problems and local authorities responsible for
   decision-making on flood management. The paper concludes with a number
   of recommendations for flood hazard management policy making and
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been recognised as a powerful
   means to integrate and analyse data from various sources in the context
   of comprehensive floodplain management. As part of this comprehensive
   approach to floodplain management, it is very important to be able to
   predict the consequences of different scenarios in terms of flooded
   areas and associated risk. Hydrologic and hydraulic modelling plays a
   crucial role and there is much to gain in incorporating these modelling
   capabilities in GIS. This is still a rather complex task and research is
   being done on the full integration of these models. Interfacing between
   these models and GIS may be a very efficient way of overcoming the
   difficulties and getting very good results in terms of engineering
   practice. This paper presents results based on the use of Intergraph GIS
   coupled with Idrisi GIS. Using these two systems substantially increased
   the flexibility of using GIS as a tool for flood studies. A lumped
   (XSRAIN) and a distributed (OMEGA) hydrologic models were used to
   simulate flood hydrographs. The well known HEC-2 Hydraulic model was
   used to compute flooded areas. These models were applied in the
   Livramento catchment with very good results. The computation of flooded
   areas for different flood scenarios, and its representation in GIS, can
   be used in the assessment of affected property and associated damages.
   This is a very useful GIS-based approach to floodplain management.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{81-93}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The influence of initial water saturation on residual organic saturation
   was studied by determining pressure-saturation relationships with a
   pressure cell apparatus. Initial water saturations varying from 0.02 to
   0.40 were investigated by allowing gasoline to imbibe into the water wet
   soil, displacing the mobile air. Subsequently, air was forced back into
   the soil in a series of incremental steps that resulted in gasoline
   drainage and a measurement of residual gasoline saturation. The data
   indicate that water saturation must be considered in order to understand
   retention and movement of liquid organics in the vadose zone. It is
   concluded that residual organic saturation decreases by the amount that
   initial water saturation increases, as Leverett's assumption implies,
   for initial water saturations less than a critical value. For initial
   water saturations greater than the critical values the residual oil
   saturation remained constant, the total liquid saturation increased and
   Leverett's assumption was no longer valid.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been a marked decline in the amount of
   hydrological data being collected in many parts of the developing world.
   This paper reviews some of the arguments in favour of the continued
   collection of hydrological data. The technical case is based on the need
   for long record lengths in order to obtain a reasonable estimate for the
   mean and variability of river flows. Estimates are presented for the
   dependence of the standard error on record length for the case of the
   main sample statistics, for reservoir design and for flood estimation.
   Typical values are presented both in general terms and for some specific
   historical time series. The current status of hydrological data
   collection in Africa is then contrasted with the situation in Europe
   before concluding with the results of several case studies of schemes in
   Africa and Asia whose operational performance has been affected due to
   insufficient hydrological data.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the
   municipal water system in Fukuoka city. In combination with daily
   simulation model, a kind of risk model incorporating water demand
   prediction is presented. This model applies five risk indices:
   reliability, resiliency, vulnerability, drought risk index (DRI) and
   drought damage index (DDI). They aid in the identification of operation
   policies for the municipal water system, and the planning and
   operational policies obtained are aimed at achieving minimum risk for a
   given scenario of operation. In this paper, the performance risk of the
   municipal water system is investigated under three alternatives: (1) the
   existing system operation when available supply from the Chikugo river
   is decreased; (2) water restrictions for different percentages of
   reduction are implemented; and (3) available water supply increases when
   desalination of sea water is implemented. The results obtained show that
   savings of between 5 and 12\% of water consumption from May 1, or
   increasing of daily desalination of sea water about 30 000 m(3) or more,
   may efficiently decrease the performance risk of the Fukuoka water
   supply system. Potentials also exist for further increase of reservoir
   storage by more rational operation. The measure that more attention
   should be paid to increasing the water supply from stable sources is
   recommended as well.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the development and application of monthly water balance
   models has been carried out since the 1940s. A good body of experience
   has been gained for many models, and a review of these models is needed.
   Beginning with the development of monthly water balance models from the
   earliest times, this paper discusses the relevance of various aspects of
   the practical application of such models. Monthly water balance models
   were introduced originally to evaluate the importance of different
   hydrologic parameters under a variety of hydrologic conditions. Present
   applications of water balance models are directed along three main
   lines: reconstruction of the hydrology of catchments, assessment of
   climatic impact changes, and evaluation of the seasonal and geographical
   patterns of water supply and irrigation demand.}},

Abstract = {{Computers have become the main tool used in Ground Water Quality
   Management (GWQM). Computer software has been developed to encapsulate,
   process and present information on groundwater pollution problems.
   Continuing demands for more efficient handling of information have
   resulted in increasing integration of the software into Decision Support
   Systems (DSSs). Encapsulation and integration of both quantitative
   (numerical) and qualitative (knowledge) information are required to
   support decision-making processes. A review of current achievements in
   the software integration and especially in knowledge encapsulation
   reveals no clear developing directions (research lines) in these fields.
   Attention must be therefore directed to: (1) the main GWQM tasks, seen
   in the light of knowledge encapsulation, and (2) postulates and
   techniques of Artificial Intelligence (AI) related to knowledge
   encapsulation and DSS development. The case-specific nature of
   groundwater pollution problems and a lack of formalised expertise in
   GWQM are the main difficulties in development of knowledge-containing
   systems. Work on the taxonomy of GWQM tasks and related knowledge is
   recommended to enable broader application of AI in knowledge
   encapsulation, as well as in development of DSSs for GWQM as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{Global climate change related to natural and anthropogenic processes has
   been the topic of concern and interest world wide. Despite ongoing
   research efforts, the climate predictions cannot be rated any better
   than speculative or possible scenarios whose probability of occurrence
   is, at the present stage, impossible to assess. One of the most
   significant impacts of the `greenhouse effect' is anticipated to be on
   water resources, including different elements of the hydrologic cycle,
   water supply and demand, regional vulnerability, and water quality.
   Thus, the impact of climate change appears to be an additional component
   on top of the large number of existing water-related problems.
   The existence of the greenhouse effect, the increase of greenhouse gas
   emissions, and the rise of corresponding concentrations are things that
   are certain. However, their impacts on hydrology and water management
   are highly uncertain. In the latter area, one needs information on much
   smaller spatial and temporal scales than those used in climate studies.
   The objective of the present paper is to analyze the climate change
   impact on water resources in a system's perspective, to discuss
   scientific gaps, and challenge scientific issues. The role of different
   scales and uncertainties, as well as the hydrological view of global
   circulation models are also discussed. Our preparedness for probable
   global (climate) change is reviewed in terms of assessment, planning,
   design and adaptation.}},

   curves Psi(theta) of the layers were obtained and approximated by van
   Genuchten's analytical equation. The relationship K(theta) between
   hydraulic conductivity and moisture was estimated by van Genuchten's
   prediction model. Psi(theta) and K(theta) equations were used as inputs
   in the numerical model. The drainage of water was simulated by Richard's
   partial differential equation, which was solved with the finite
   differences computational scheme type Laasonen. The upper and lower
   boundary conditions were zero flux and a periodically changing head
   respectively. Numerical results show a good agreement with experimental
   data, with small deviations for certain hours.}},

Abstract = {{A new set of irrigation performance indicators based on remote-sensing
   estimates of evapotranspiration is introduced. These `evapotranspiration
   indicators' are the relative evapotranspiration or crop stress and the
   water efficiency as well as their uniformity. With a remote-sensing
   evapotranspiration algorithm (SEBAL) maps of actual crop water
   consumption are derived. These maps are one of the inputs in the
   evapotranspiration indicators, together with GIS data (digitized
   irrigation unit boundaries) and field data (irrigation delivery schedule
   and water flow). This approach is applied on the Rio Tunuyan irrigation
   scheme, Mendoza, Argentina, which is served by surface water and
   privately owned ground water pumps. A homogeneous pattern of actual crop
   water consumption is detected from the highest irrigation level till the
   lowest (farm) level (coefficient of variance from 8.6\% to 6.1\% and
   14.0\% of secondary, tertiary and pixel level, respectively).
   Considering that a rotational irrigation schedule at tertiary and farm
   level is present, the results indicate that ground water supply through
   extraction and capillary rise equalize the spatial patterns in crop
   water consumption. The latter is proved by a comparison between (i) the
   areal water consumption from remote-sensing measurements, (ii) the areal
   water supply and (iii) additional field information on ground water
   extraction and capillary rise.}},

   analyzes municipal Best Management Practices for municipalities in five

   the severe economic recessionary times, the BMPs implemented with the
   greatest frequency (by cities in the five counties studied) are the most
   cost-beneficial for cities to implement. Each city located in the five
   counties studied is identified as a coastal, valley, or mountain city.
   The number of cities that have implemented each BMP are categorized to
   determine which BMPs are most frequently implemented on a regional
   basis, and are therefore the most cost-beneficial.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{The problem of vertical one-dimensional infiltration for both ponded and
   constant flux boundary conditions was studied through the use of
   existing analytic solutions. Main objective was to compare the soil
   moisture profile developed under constant flux boundary condition at the
   time of ponding theta(R)(z, T), with that moisture profile developed
   under ponded conditions at an earlier time theta(F) (z, t(C)). Time t(C)
   denotes the time when the decreasing infiltration rate for the ponded
   conditions becomes equal to the constant flux q, applied for the
   constant flux case.
   One might state that the analytical solutions, for both cases do not
   give identical profiles. An approximate coincidence might be brought
   about through a modification in the diffusivity which, in many respects,
   seems justified. Practical outcome of the above analysis is the
   determination of the time of ponding T, after which surface runoff
   starts, for the constant flux case. This is of practical significance
   either under natural conditions of rainfall or under conditions of
   sprinkle-irrigation, since surface runoff is directly related with soil
   erosion and waste of irrigation water. Therefore any attempt to
   determine the time of ponding T is well merited.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive stochastic management methodology is developed for a
   distributed-parameter estuary system (DPES) which is described by
   partial differential equations (PDEs). The proposed stochastic
   management methodology consists of uncertainty-based calibration (i.e.
   parameter estimation under uncertainty) and uncertainty-based control
   (i.e. determination of optimal freshwater inflows into the estuary under
   uncertainty). The technique for uncertainty-based calibration is based
   on Gauss-Newton minimization method and uncertainty analysis method such
   as Rosenblueth's point estimate method or Harr's point estimate method.
   The uncertainty-based calibration technique is used to estimate the
   optimal parameters such as Manning's roughness coefficient and
   dispersion coefficient in the PDEs while considering the uncertainties
   in the boundary conditions or initial conditions for the PDEs. The
   technique for uncertainty-based control is based on a real-time control
   method which is discrete-time stochastic linear quadratic feedback
   control. Real-time control is achieved by feedback control which uses
   salinities at test stations in the estuary as the state vector and
   controlled freshwater inflows as the control vector. The feedback
   control law determines the real-time control vector using observed
   states in a manner that best approximates desired states and controls
   (freshwater inflows). This new methodology for real-time control has
   been applied to the Lavaca-Tres Palacios Estuary in Texas for purposes
   of testing and illustration.}},

Abstract = {{The optimal flow allocation in the Zambezi system, the largest
   multi-reservoir water resources system in southern Africa, is analysed.
   The problem is formulated in network terms and solved with a network
   flow algorithm. The present configuration of the system is taken as the
   reference to evaluate the benefits of the proposed modifications to the
   existing hydropower schemes. The introduction of additional operational
   constraints is also considered in order to analyse the costs of
   environmental protection of paludal ecosystems and to account for
   secondary objectives (e.g. irrigation, fishery, navigation). The results
   show that the upgrade of Kafue Gorge scheme through the addition of a
   new generator stage is the most advantageous from the hydropower
   production view point. In addition, the protection of paludal ecosystems
   through periodic controlled flooding and an increase of withdrawals for
   irrigation purposes may be achieved without dramatically changing the
   hydroelectric energy production.}},

Abstract = {{A two-phase stochastic dynamic programming model is developed for
   optimal operation of irrigation reservoirs under a multicrop
   environment. Under a multicrop environment, the crops compete for the
   available water whenever the water available is less than the irrigation
   demands. The performance of the reservoir depends on how the deficit is
   allocated among the competing crops. The proposed model integrates
   reservoir release decisions with water allocation decisions. The water
   requirements of crops vary from period to period and are determined from
   the soil moisture balance equation taking into consideration the
   contribution of soil moisture and rainfall for the water requirements of
   the crops. The model is demonstrated over an existing reservoir and the
   performance of the reservoir under the operating policy derived using
   the model is evaluated through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The application of a decision analysis methodology to a small-scale
   water-supply/aquifer-contamination problem is presented. The main
   characteristic of the study is the development of a series of
   alternative strategies to ensure a continuous water supply to a village
   under variable risk conditions. It is assumed that the risks involved in
   the analysis reflect the uncertainty as to the hydraulic conductivity.
   Thus, a stochastic simulation model for groundwater flow and contaminant
   transport is employed in order to evaluate the implications of
   uncertainty in the system's behaviour upon the overall design decisions.
   Alternative decision strategies are formulated by considering both
   actual and probabilistic costs, and they are finally compared using a
   risk-cost-benefit objective function.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the estimation of the economic costs of hydrologic
   data collection using the concept of opportunity cost. The opportunity
   cost of operating a hydrologic data collection network is equal to the
   maximum value the resources used in its operation would have if they
   were free to be used in another area. A method for estimating the
   opportunity cost of operating individual stations is developed in this
   paper. This method is then demonstrated using representative opportunity
   cost estimates for individual stations in a hypothetical network based
   on the Victorian hydrologic data collection network, Australia. An
   important distinction is made between financial costs and economic
   costs, particularly with respect to their relative suitabilities for use

   available. To obtain better environment and, at the same time, better
   and comparable data on this environment, the European Union issued a
   number of legal instruments (directives and council and commission
   decisions). After some generic considerations on information
   requirements, this paper presents a brief review of the water resources
   information policy in five European countries. The European information
   policy is also addressed, a special mention being made to the European

Abstract = {{A methodology is presented for planning the operation of the
   Fuerte-Carrizo irrigation system in northwest Mexico. The system has two
   storage dams, two irrigation districts, and water transfer capabilities
   between both dams. The methodology uses a combination of linear
   programming (LP) and simulation. The LP model maximizes the net return
   of the farmers, subject to restrictions of the system, availability of
   water and land, and water transfer relationships. The simulation model
   is programmed as a microcomputer interactive package simulating the
   performance of the system. The methodology has proven to be a useful
   tool to assist those responsible for the operation of the irrigation
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Seepage from open channels is one of the major problems involved in the
   design of irrigation networks. However the advantage of conserving water
   is necessary as water is becoming a scarce commodity. As the suspended
   solid materials in water became less than 100 ppm after the construction
   of the High Aswan Dam (HAD) in Egypt, unfortunately few previous
   practical formulas for estimating seepage losses along earthen Egyptian
   canals are applicable and new design equations are needed. Through the
   present paper, extensive field data measurements have been carried out
   on carrier irrigation canals for seepage analysis. Regression equations
   were developed for relating seepage losses to the flow and geometrical
   canal parameters. These deduced equations are based on the
   inflow-outflow procedure and the boundary materials, and are valid for
   earthen canals having discharges ranging between 2 and 20 m(3)/sec.}},

Abstract = {{An application of GIS-aided modeling is done at an area in South

   through which the database is queried to derive model input parameters,
   and to visually present results in maps. Results for current conditions
   and practices show that sediments, nutrients and pesticides are present
   in surface runoff and ground water. Two alternatives to minimize
   pollution levels are evaluated, i.e., reduction of fertilizer
   application to the minimum required for effective agricultural growth
   and replacement of fertilizers with sewage sludge. In addition, the
   impact of urbanization of the agricultural area to the pollutant levels
   is tested. Both alternatives and the urbanization result in overall

Abstract = {{Calibration and validation of the MIKE-SHE model was performed using the
   Neuenkirchen research catchment hydrologic characteristics and a
   two-year time series of stream flows at the outlet of the catchment. A
   reasonable match was obtained between the observed and simulated
   hydrograph at the catchment outlet with minor calibration effort. For
   the validation runs, the base flows were overestimated in the period of
   high rainfall intensity while the peak flows were reasonably matched.
   Sensitivity of the model to structural parameters such as grid size and
   time step, and to the functional parameters, including hydraulic
   resistance coefficient, surface and subsurface hydraulic properties, was
   investigated. The results indicated that the peak overland flow and the
   total overland flow were very sensitive to the flow resistance
   parameters and to the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the surface
   soil, while the peak aquifer discharge and the total aquifer discharge
   were sensitive to the horizontal hydraulic conductivity in the saturated
   zone. The model output variables considered were neither affected, to a
   significant extent, by the vegetation parameters nor by the specific
   storage coefficient.}},

   grid-based mesh was used to abstract the geometry of the catchment. The
   hydrological processes and geographic information were modeled on this
   scale. Both linear and nonlinear models were calibrated by global
   optimization technique. The models to simulate spatial hydrological
   processes over a catchment were verified using the observed hydrographs
   at two stream gauged stations within the catchment. The nonlinear model
   has better performance than the linear model for two verification storm
   events.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops and applies a mathematical model for determining the
   economically optimal scheduling of fertilization and irrigation
   (fertigation) that maximizes the farmer's profits. The analysis assumes
   a single crop (corn) and a single growing season. For a given total
   seasonal fertigation level, the optimal scheduling solution to the
   optimization problem identifies not only the maximum profits but also
   the minimum total nitrogen leached below the root zone and, therefore,
   the minimum groundwater contamination. The conceptual framework, coupled
   with the experimental data for corn, are used to investigate the impacts
   of taxing the total nitrogen leaching and an action equivalent taxation
   of nitrogen fertilizer. It is demonstrated that the increase in the
   fertilizer tax required to achieve a given level of reduction of total
   nitrogen leaching is much smaller in relation to the change in the tax
   on leached nitrogen required to achieve the same reduction.}},

   second part of the study deals with an analysis of the consistency of
   results obtained by using different time series, in order to select two

Abstract = {{Nonpoint source (NPS) pollution from urban runoff has been established
   as a major cause of receiving water degradation. In an effort to control
   this problem, new regulations have been passed in the U.S.A. and

   programs. This paper reviews recent regulations and studies related to
   urban stormwater runoff control and planning in the U.S.A.; discusses
   fundamentals of urban NPS pollution including transport processes and
   types and sources of pollutants; reviews current hydrologic and water
   quality mathematical models used in the U.S.A.; presents case studies in
   both modeling and management; and describes fundamentals of Best
   Management Practices (BMPs) in urban runoff control. Finally, it
   summarizes future research needs.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of estimation of the velocity parameter in the exponential
   distribution geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (ED-GIUH) is
   investigated in this study. The main difficulty in applying the ED-GIUH
   model is the estimation of this parameter. In the present study, the
   ED-GIUH model is applied to six watersheds in Indiana, U. S. A. The
   relationships between the velocity parameter and climatic as well as
   basin geomorphologic parameters are investigated. The results of the
   study indicate that the velocity parameter is related to effective
   rainfall depth, total basin area and cumulative slope; it does not
   depend on runoff characteristics. Therefore, the ED-GIUH model can be
   used for estimating discharge hydrographs from ungauged watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Data from three stations Agra, Dehradun and Dehli, were analyzed for
   evaluation of changes in rainfall and temperature regimes in the upper
   and middle parts of the Ganga basin in northern India. Long-term data on
   monsoon rainfall, the number of rainy days during the monsoon season,
   and the annual maximum temperature at these stations were included in
   the analysis. Nonparametric methods were employed to identify trends, if
   any, in these data. The analysis shows that the total monsoon rainfall
   and the number of rainy days during the monsoon season are on the
   decline, whereas the annual maximum temperature is on the rise. These
   changes are observed to have begun around the second half of the 1960's.
   The results point towards a possible change in the climatic regime of
   the Ganga basin that has far-reaching implications for the Indian

Abstract = {{The drought severity is the most important parameter for the design of
   water storage systems in order to alleviate the water shortages during

   can be estimated using the truncated normal distribution of the deficits
   in individual drought years, Poisson distribution of the number of
   drought spells over a period of T years and geometric distribution of
   drought duration. The analysis can be done for random or Markovian
   structure of drought variable (annual rainfall or runoff sequences)
   distributed normally or lognormally. The study indicated that the
   severity at a high truncation level is larger than that at a low
   truncation level over any desired return period T. Severity is also
   larger in the case of autocorrelated drought variable. A frequency
   formula for the largest drought severity can be formulated analogous to
   the flood frequency formula commonly found in the hydrologic texts.}},

   lack of knowledge about existing water resources, have caused water
   shortage problems for water supply to large cities and irrigation in
   many regions of China. There is an urgent need for the efficient use and
   regional planning of water resources. For these purposes, the monthly
   variation of discharges should be made available. In this paper, a
   simple water balance modelling approach was applied to seven catchments
   (385-2000 km(2)) for water resources assessment. Six catchments were
   chosen from the humid region in southern China and one catchment from
   the semi-arid and semi-humid region in northern China. The results are
   satisfactory. It is suggested that the proposed modelling approach
   provides a valuable tool in the hands of planners and designers of water

Abstract = {{A numerical solution of the nonlinear two-dimensional unsteady
   groundwater flow over sloping beds, using the Galerkin finite element
   method, is presented. The applied differential equation is based on the
   assumption that the streamlines are parallel to the sloping bed while
   the conventional differential equation is based on theDupuit-Forchheimer
   assumption of horizontal flow. Furthermore, the gradient of the
   piezometric head is evaluated as a function of the unknown slope of the
   groundwater free surface and not simply as the absolute slope of the
   water table. Water table profiles and seepage rates obtained from the
   model are compared with those obtained by analytical solutions and
   experimental results for steady one-dimensional flow and for different
   values of bed slope. Results of the present model compares reasonably
   well with experimental results and with the results of Childs'
   analytical solution. The unsteady-state solution for different values of
   bed slope are compared to the results of a model based on the assumption
   that the water table slope is equal to the bed slope. The differences in
   the predicted water table by these two models are insignificant for
   small slopes but increase with increasing slope.}},

Abstract = {{A procedure based on the method of derived distributions is proposed for
   the estimation of flood frequency from ungauged watersheds. The results
   of previous research on rainfall characteristics and watershed response
   are incorporated into the proposed procedure. These rainfall
   characteristics are storm depth, storm duration, space and time
   distribution. A simplified watershed model is used which has previously
   given good simulation of the watershed response. Some of the rainfall
   and watershed model parameters are stochastic in nature and are assumed
   to follow various probability distributions. Monte Carlo simulation is
   used for the generation of the various parameter values and simulation
   of the peak flow hydrographs. After 5000 realizations, the frequency of
   the hourly and daily peak flow and the flood volume is estimated. The
   proposed procedure is applied to eight coastal British Columbia
   watersheds and the results compare well with the observed data and with
   fitted probability distributions. The method is easy to apply, requires
   limited data and is shown to be reliable. Sensitivity analysis shows
   that the procedure is not very sensitive to uncertainty of the parameter
   values and is not dependent on the parameter probability distributions

Abstract = {{An important question in the systematic and objective design of
   general-purpose groundwater quality monitoring networks is how to
   evaluate quantitatively the information they provide. However, many
   applications require the design of a groundwater monitoring network in
   conjunction with remedial action at a subsurface contamination site. In
   such a case, it is conceptually clear what is a successful network: One
   that reduces the net cost of meeting the objectives of cleanup.
   Uncertainty entails a cost because the natural management response to
   uncertainty is overdesign for the sake of conservatism ('safety
   factor'). The additional information that the network provides must lead
   to cost reductions that outweigh its cost. This paper presents a method
   to determine the installation time and location of an additional
   monitoring well while the aquifer is being cleaned up. While rates of
   pumping and treatment are determined by the dual control method (a
   method for optimization with incomplete information) candidate well
   locations are ranked according to a `cost-to-go' index that measures the
   costs expected until the goals of remediation are met. This index
   accounts for the cost associated with uncertainty about the system and
   thus is useful in appraising the value of information from new
   measurements in the context of the specific cleanup effort. The
   usefulness of the method is illustrated through application to a
   hypothetical two-dimensional aquifer with uncertain initial estimates of
   the system parameters and variables. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate
   the cost effectiveness of solution obtained through this method.}},

Abstract = {{The potential impacts of changing climatic conditions on the operational
   performance of water resource systems was investigated in this paper. A
   multi-site streamflow generation model was used to synthesize potential
   monthly flow sequences reflecting two different sets of climatic
   conditions. The generated data were subsequently employed as input to a
   reservoir operation model that was used to determine the reservoir
   response to the inflow resulting from the implementation of the
   reservoir operating policy. The performance of an example reservoir
   system, the Shellmouth Reservoir located in the Canadian province of
   Manitoba, was evaluated and compared for the two sets of conditions. The
   operational performance was evaluated in terms of the reliability of the
   system for meeting the three purposes of the actual reservoir. The
   reservoir performance was determined to be sensitive to the inflow data.
   The results indicate that climatic change has potentially important
   implications for the operation of the example reservoir system.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of mechanical cutting for weed control along vegetated

   was measured in channels completely infested by submerged macrophytes.
   Next, a path was cut along one or both canal banks by mechanical means
   and the measurement of flow resistance was repeated. The experiments and
   measurements carried out during only one seasson are described. A series
   of relationships between the flow resistance and a cross-section of
   areas both free from vegetation and with vegetation density,
   respectively, were found. Clearly, the elucidation of such relationships
   will be useful in assessing the frictional effects of submerged
   macrophyte growths in relation to the design and management of

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{333-354}},

Abstract = {{Most of the rivers in Taiwan are short and run on a steep slope due to
   the island's topography. Because of the weak correlations of streamflow
   in time and the occurrence of extreme events such as typhoons, classical
   autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models have difficulties in
   forecasting and synthesizing the average 10-day streamflow in Taiwan. In
   this study, the synthesis of the average 10-day streamflow of the
   Tanshui River in Taiwan is accomplished by a section model. The model
   divides the year-round streamflow records into several sections
   according to their distinguishable patterns, and each section is modeled
   by a separate ARMA model. For parameter control, a heuristic grouping
   procedure, based on statistical inference of the random noise part, is
   used to separate a year into a minimum number of sections. The section
   separation procedure follows the general precipitation pattern in a
   year. The case study results indicate high statistical agreement between
   synthesized series and historical records. Additionally, a new
   procedure, extended autocorrelation function (EACH), is introduced and
   applied in this study to assist in model identification.}},

Abstract = {{The paper concerns the optimization of pumping and artificial recharge
   rates under hydraulic head constraints. This optimization is
   accomplished by means of an inverse three-dimensional (3D) model which
   is a combination of a numerical model, sensitivity analyses and
   nonlinear regression. The optimization criterion used is the
   minimization of the sum of the squares between the calculated and the
   desired water table maps. These maps were established for the end of
   each month of the period from December to August so that the annual
   average flux is outward from the modeling area. This outward flux will
   push back the salt water intrusion. The assumed natural recharge rates
   of the different months equal the mean values of the period 1958-1977.
   The aquifer parameters describing the water conducting and storing
   properties are also required as input data as well as the initial
   hydraulic heads. The optimized parameters are the artificial recharge
   rates of the months December, January, February and March and the
   pumping rates of the months April, May, June, July and August. For the
   first-mentioned months, the pumping rates are considered as known.
   During the last-mentioned period, no artificial recharge is possible. A
   unique solution is obtained. To check the optimized rates, a water
   balance is made. With this balance, it is shown that the treated
   phreatic aquifer can be used as a subterranean reservoir to store water
   that is abundantly present in the winter until the summer when water
   demand is large. It is also proved that the salt-water intrusion can be
   stopped by the temporal storage of the artificial recharged water.}},

Abstract = {{Planned utilization of groundwater from a contaminated aquifer requires
   development of management strategies that determine the spatial
   distribution of withdrawal for allocation, as well as for control of
   water quality. Minimization of groundwater allocation for different
   purposes, and the control of contamination in the aquifer by a specified
   pumping strategy constitute a management problem with two conflicting
   objectives. In order to demonstrate possible tradeoffs between water
   quality control objective and minimum groundwater withdrawal objective,
   a multiobjective optimization model is formulated. The solution of the
   model specifies a strategy to control pollution distribution in the
   aquifer as per agricultural needs, and also evolve an optimal allocation
   policy to statisfy agricultural demands. Pareto-optimal solutions
   representing the tradeoff between the two noncommensurate objectives are
   established. The formulated model uses the embedding technique for
   simulating the flow and the transport processes in the aquifer. The
   constraint method is used to transform the multiobjective optimization
   model into a single objective optimization model. The resulting model is
   solved using the exterior penalty function method in conjunction with
   the Hooke-Jeeves method. The proposed model is easily adoptable for
   various agroclimatic regions and cropping patterns. For illustrative
   purposes, the model is applied to a specified study area. Although
   solutions of the model are presented and discussed as per agricultural
   requirements in terms of both quality and quantity, solutions for other
   kinds of water demands can be obtained using the same model with minor
   modifications. Results show that an optimal pumping strategy can be
   effectively utilized for controlling contamination in the aquifer.}},

   series expansion of the effective saturation (Theta) power and given in
   a simple algebraic relation. For checking the new model, twelve soils
   were selected from the available literature and a comparison was made
   between the new model, the experimental curve and the van Genuchten
   model as well. The suggested model is very close to the van Genuchten
   model in all cases except one and it exhibits hysteresis, due to the
   different values of the parameter b of Brutsaert equation for the
   wetting and drainage curves. Also a second model is presented, based on
   the Burdine integral relation.}},

   water resources is constantly on the rise. In order to stress the
   importance of GIS in water resources management, applications related to
   this area are addressed and evaluated for efficient future research and
   development. Fundamentals of GIS are summarized and the history of the
   GIS evolution in water resources is discussed. Current GIS applications
   are presented including surface hydrologic and groundwater modeling,
   water supply and sewer system modeling, stormwater and nonpoint source
   pollution modeling for urban and agricultural areas, and other related
   applications. Future research and development needs are presented, based

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from the EUROflood research project
   sponsored by the European Commission under the EPOCH programme. The
   paper evaluates levels of development of flood forecasting, warning and
   response systems (FFWRS) in the European Union with reference to
   riverine and tidal floods in The Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
   Germany, France and Portugal. An experimental evaluation methodology,
   comprising fourteen criteria and five development stages, is used to
   evaluate FFWRS. Flood forecasting is the starting point, but the
   research addresses entire FFWRS. Despite advances in flood forecasting,
   FFWRS often under-perform because warning dissemination and response are
   unsatisfactory.
   FFWRS have developed in response to different water resource management
   problems, varying flood characteristics and different historic, cultural
   and institutional factors. FFWRS for flood defence and flood emergency
   response are the main focus, but they are also important for navigation,
   bridge clearance, fishing, recreation and industry. France, parts of
   Germany, The Netherlands and England and Wales have relatively mature
   FFWRS. FFWRS are much less well developed in Scotland, Northern Ireland
   and Portugal, and important areas for enhancement are identified in all
   countries. Cross-country and within-country comparisons reveal the
   potential for knowledge transfer, although ultimately the unique
   circumstances of each country places limits upon this process.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{303-320}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Hydrograph recession constants are required in rainfall-runoff models,
   baseflow augmentation studies, geohydrologic investigations and in
   regional low-flow studies. The recession portion of a streamflow
   hydrograph is shown to be either an autoregressive processor an
   integrated moving average process, depending upon the structure of the
   assumed model errors. Six different estimators of the baseflow recession
   constant are derived and tested using thousands of hydrograph recessions
   available at twenty-three sites in Massachusetts, U. S. When hydrograph
   recessions are treated as an autoregressive process, unconditional least
   squares or maximum likelihood estimators of the baseflow recession
   constant are shown to exhibit significant downward bias due to the short
   lengths of hydrograph recessions. The precision of estimates of
   hydrograph recession constants is shown to depend heavily upon
   assumptions regarding the structure of the model errors. In general,
   regression procedures for estimating hydrograph recession parameters are
   generally preferred to the time-series alternatives. An evaluation of
   the physical significance of estimates of the baseflow recession
   constant is provided by comparing regional regression models which
   relate low-flow statistics to three independent variables: drainage
   area, basin slope and the baseflow recession constant. As anticipated,
   approximately unbiased estimators of the baseflow recession constant
   provide significant information regarding the geohydrologic response of
   watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{A hedging policy is characterized by three parameters, namely, starting
   water availability (SWA), ending water availability (EWA) and hedging
   factor (HF). The effects of these three parameters on the reservoir
   performance indicators have been evaluated and discussed for a southwest
   monsoon-dependent within-year reservoir system in southern India. For
   the performance evaluation, synthetically generated periodic inflow
   sequences from a periodic autoregressive model have been used. Quite a
   number of the 1800 hedging policies considered for the reservoir system,
   yield a better overall performance compared to the standard operating
   policy (SOP). Reliability, Resilience and vulnerability are found to
   increase with SWA for a specified EWA. On the other hand, all these
   performance indicators are found to decrease with EWA for a specified
   SWA. Hence, it is desirable to start the hedging at reasonably high SWA.
   All performance indicators remain practically constant at higher ranges
   of EWA for a given SWA. If hedging is started when there is enough water
   in storage, reliability, resilience and average deficit increase with
   degree of hedging, whereas vulnerability decreases significantly up to a
   hedging factor of 0.3. An interactive computer program has been
   developed for the selection of compromising hedging policies, and its
   usefulness has been discussed.}},

   essential. In this paper, a problem of groundwater mound formation in
   response to a transient recharge from a rectangular area is
   investigated. An approximate analytical solution has been developed to
   predict the transient evolution of the water table. Application of the
   solution and its sensitivity to the variation of the recharge rate have
   been illustrated with the help of a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{To achieve effective environmental control, it is important to develop
   methodologies for dealing with uncertainties in model simulation of
   pollution behaviour and effects. Several procedures have been proposed
   to quantify uncertainties in modelling studies. This paper utilizes the
   two methods that are widely applied, i.e. functional analysis and Monte
   Carlo Simulation.
   The first-order part of the functional analysis method provides a
   measure of uncertainties in dependent variables in terms of
   uncertainties in independent variables. The procedure is based on
   first-order terms in the Taylor series expansion of the dependent
   variable about its mean value with respect to one or more independent
   variables. The major assumption in this procedure is that all
   independent and dependent variables are the second moment variables
   (SMV), which means that the behaviour of any SMV is completely described
   by its mean and standard deviation. The mathematical simplicity of the
   procedure allows application by simple input-output models.
   Consequently, it has been applied to many environmental simulators, e.
   g. hydrological models, stream water quality models, lake water quality
   models and ground water pollution models.
   The Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method uses a large number of repeated
   trials or simulations with the values for stochastic inputs or uncertain
   variables selected at random from their assumed parent probability
   distributions to establish an expected range of model uncertainty.}},

   exponentially decaying function with its decay constant as a Gaussian

   water-table height, i.e. mean and standard deviation, are presented. By
   using these expressions, the effect of uncertainty in the recharge rate

Abstract = {{This paper determines the aquifer transmissivity and storage coefficient
   from time-drawdown data of pumping tests using a siphon well including a
   main pumped well along with ten brach pumped wells (deaired wells). The
   pumping data was analyzed by the Cooper-Jacob graphical method. The
   computed transmissivity and storage coefficient are 435.8 m(2)/day and
   6.54 x 10(-4) with pumping rates of 432 m(3)/day. Distances from the
   pumped wells to the observation well ranges from 225 to 268 m. The
   pumping tests from this siphon well (No. 38), one of the siphon wells in
   the Nansalun Pump Field, Tainan, Taiwan, were started at 1040 a. m. on
   19 March, 1992 and continued for 1534 min and then were shut
   simultaneously for water recovery. Groundwater withdrawals were pumped
   from the uppermost confined aquifer in the pump field.
   The siphon well is used to continuously provide a sufficient yield for
   pumping tests and irrigation, and is used when the pumped level and
   aquifer coefficients for more distant observation wells are to be
   measured and computed. These may not be achieved in less transmissive
   aquifers when a single pumped well is used. The siphon well can become a
   single pumped well in case the ten branch pumped wells (or deaired
   wells) are not used.}},

Abstract = {{Kriging is a geostatistical estimation technique for regionalized
   variables that exhibit an autocorrelation structure. Such a structure
   can be described by a semivariogram of the observed data. The
   punctual-Aging estimate at any point is a weighted average of the data,
   where the weights are determined by using the semivariogram and an
   assumed drift, or lack of drift, in the data. The kriging algorithm,
   based on unbiased and minimum-variance estimates, involves a linear
   system of equations to calculate the weights. Kriging is applied in an
   attempt to describe the spatial variability of rainfall data over a
   geographical region in northern Greece. Monthly rainfall data of January
   and June 1987 have been taken from 20 measurement stations throughout
   the above area. The rainfall data are used to compute semivariograms for
   each month. The resulting semivariograms are anisotropic and fitted by
   linear and spherical models. Kriging estimates of rainfall and standard
   deviation were made at 90 locations covering the study area in a
   rectangular grid and the results used to plot contour maps of rainfall
   and contour maps of kriging standard deviation. Verification of the
   kriging estimates of rainfall are made by removing known data points and
   kriging an estimate at the same location. This verification is known as
   the jacknifing technique. Kriging errors, a by-product of the
   calculations, can then be used to give confidence intervals of the
   resulting estimates. The acceptable results of the verification
   procedure demonstrated that geostatistics can be used to describe the
   spatial variability of rainfall. Finally, it is shown how the property
   of kriging variance depends on the structure and the geometric
   configuration of the data points and the point to be estimated can also
   be used for the optimal design of the rain gauge network in an area.}},

Abstract = {{In the wake of increased environmental and sustainability concerns
   associated with agricultural development, developing countries are faced
   with the dilemma of choice between the short-run technological gains and
   the long-run environmental conservation. A dynamic investment decision
   model is developed to optimize the use of scarce public investment funds
   in the management of irrigation water supply, depth to water table and
   soil salinity. Four major classes of investments with different impacts
   on the hydrological balance within the Indus basin are considered: (a)
   expansion of the surface irrigation network, (b) public drainage
   projects, (c) tax and subsidy policies designed to influence the rate of
   private groundwater exploitation and (d) investment in improving the
   efficiency of the existing canal system by reducing conveyance losses.
   The crop area lost due to water logging and salt accumulation is treated
   as a damage cost of increasing the application of surface irrigation
   water. The resulting optimality conditions from the model are used to
   assess the development and operation of public drainage projects. The
   model results are compared for areas underlain by fresh and saline
   groundwater. The model is also used to analyze recent policy debate
   which has focused on the use of incentives such as subsidized credit,
   energy subsidies, and electrical grid expansion to accomplish the
   transfer of tubewell operation from the public to the private sector.
   Optimal switching conditions for such transfers are derived. The results
   show that a private farmer's optimal decision will diverge more from the
   societal optimal decision as more externalities from surface irrigation
   are accounted for.}},

Abstract = {{Rain-sum, defined as the sum of the total rain over a wet spell during a
   rainy season, forms a sequence which has the potential to provide the
   statistics for designing a rainwater catchment system. The probability
   density function (pdf) of the rain-sum coupled with the Poisson law of
   occurrence of wet spells are used as building blocks to generate the
   cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the largest rain-sum. This cdf
   can form the basis for estimating system design parameters. This study
   revealed that the rain-sum for Kenyan environments (semi-arid and
   semi-humid) tends to obey Weibull distribution, while successive
   occurrences of wet days obey the Markov law of persistence. The process
   of estimating the cdf of the largest rain-sum not only provides
   statistics for the design of rainwater catchment systems, but also
   provides an alternative for identifying the pdf of the rain-sum and
   dependence structure in the occurrence of wet days.}},

   Factor Analysis Approach}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{10}},

Pages = {{1-20}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration is the most important variable next to rainfall in
   the context of irrigation to crops and it is a multivariate phenomenon
   as it is influenced by many hydrological variables. In this paper, the
   relative importance of different variables involved in
   evapotranspiration has been investigated through a multivariate
   tehnique, namely factor analysis. Monthly data pertaining to eight
   meteorological stations located in two tropical states of India are used
   in this analysis. Factor analysis was applied to determine the relative
   effect of rainfall, temperature (maximum and minimum), wind speed,
   relative humidity, and sunshine duration on evapotranspiration. The
   analysis was performed in two stages: in the first stage, the principal
   components were obtained and in the second stage, a set of factors was
   derived using Varimax factor rotation. Three factors were extracted
   which explained more than 85\% of the total variation in the original
   data set. The identified factors were related to physical processes
   influencing the evapotranspiration. T he results of the study reveal
   that the variables, relative humidity, temperature, and wind speed, are
   those with the most influence in the evapotranspiration process, in that
   order. The variables rainfall and sunshine duration have been found to
   have less influence on the ET process.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a small runoff-basin water-harvesting system
   (negarim) was evaluated under a typical Mediterranean arid environment
   in Jordan. Rainfall, runoff, catchment area, soil water storage, and
   crop evapotranspiration were analyzed as elements of one system. Three
   micro-catchment areas (25,50, and 75 m(2)) and three surface treatment
   methods (natural, plastic cover, and compaction) were used. Runoff
   efficiency was evaluated for 16 storms. Storage efficiency was evaluated
   for eight periods by monitoring soil water balance in the crop root
   zone. The overall efficiency of the water-harvesting system was
   determined as the ratio of the amount of water stored and used by the
   crop to the amount of rainfall received in the catchment area. The
   overall efficiency of the system varied from over 85\% to as low as 7\%
   depending on the size of the catchment and the root zone capacity. Gains
   in runoff improvement were lost when the soil moisture in the cultivated
   area was near field capacity. The required ratio of the catchment area
   to the cultivated area was found to be strongly related to the root zone
   storage capacity and the rate of consumptive use as well as
   rainfall-runoff characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Dastane (1974) recommended four different methods, namely
   evapotranspiration-rainfall ratio method, Indian-1 and Indian-2 methods
   and Vietnam method for estimating effective rainfall for rice crop.
   These methods together with the USDA-SCS method were compared against
   the physically-based water balance method. The analysis was carried out
   using daily data of evapotranspiration (ET) and rainfall pertaining to
   thirteen seasons with special reference to lowland paddy rice in South
   India. Among the different methods, the ET-rainfall ratio and Indian-2
   methods estimate the effective rainfall values nearly closer to those by
   the water balance method. The USDA-SCS method underpredicts values of
   effective rainfall compared to other methods. The ET-rainfall ratio and
   Indian-2 methods can be used as alternatives to the water balance method
   for determining effective rainfall which in turn be used in estimating
   irrigation requirements for lowland rice.}},

Abstract = {{Streamflow data have economic value because they are used for making
   decisions in water resources. By quantifying this value, hydrologists
   should find it much easier to overcome traditional obstacles to
   investment in streamflow data collection programmes. In this paper, an
   opportunity loss model is described which enables this to be done. The
   study has focused on evaluating typical benefits which may arise from
   more abundant data records for a specific purpose and, through this,
   provide further evidence which justifies investment in streamflow data
   collection activities. The specific purpose investigated is the
   development of reservoir capacity-reliability-yield relationship.
   Finally, it is argued that, while it is not uncommon for a streamgauging
   station to be project-specific, the data would invariably be used for
   other purposes and through these generate additional values.
   Considerations of such secondary values should make the whole idea of
   investment in streamflow data collection even more attractive
   economically.}},
