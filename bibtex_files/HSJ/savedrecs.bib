Abstract = {{An analytical study of major cations and anions of the glacier fed
   Alaknanda River and its tributaries has been carried out to assess the
   weathering and geochemical processes in the high altitude river basin.
   The Alaknanda and its tributaries were sampled during pre-monsoon (June
   1992) and post-monsoon (October 1992) season for the present
   hydrogeochemical study. Calcium and magnesium are the major cations,
   accounting for 85\% of the total cations. Among the anions, bicarbonate
   is the most dominant (78\%) with minor contribution from sulphate (19\%)
   and chloride (3\%). The average (Ca+Mg)/HCO3 equivalent ratio of 1.2, a
   relatively high contribution of (Ca+Mg) to the total cations (TZ(+)) and
   high (Ca+Mg)/(Na+K) ratio indicate that the carbonate weathering could
   be the primary source of the major ions to these waters. Wide seasonal
   and spatial variations are observed in the total dissolved solids (TDS)
   and total suspended matter (TSM) concentration in the Alaknanda river
   basin. The chemical denudation rate of Alaknanda is 133 t km(-2)
   year(-1), nearly double that of the Ganga river basin and three times
   the world average. The sediment erosion rate of the basin is 356 t
   km(-2) year(-1), double that of the world physical denudation rate. The
   high rates of denudation are attributed to high relief, intense monsoon
   rainfall, landslides and glacial erosion in the Himalaya.}},

Abstract = {{The Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM) river basins occupy about 1.75
   x 10(6) km(2) of the Himalayan region. More than half a billion people
   in Nepal, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh are directly or indirectly
   dependent on the water resources of the GEM rivers. These river basins
   are characterized by diversified climatic patterns. Analyses of trends
   and persistence in precipitation over these river basins are necessary
   for sound water resources planning. Time series of annual precipitation
   for each of the 16 meteorological subdivisions covering the three river
   basins were examined for trends using the Mann-Kendall rank statistic,
   Student's t-test and regression analysis, and for persistence using
   first order autocorrelation analysis. Results indicate that
   precipitation in the Ganges basin is by-and-large stable. Precipitation
   in one subdivision in the Brahmaputra basin shows a decreasing trend and
   another shows an increasing trend. One of the three subdivisions in the
   Meghna basin shows a decreasing trend while another shows an increasing
   trend. Markovian persistence is not present in the precipitation series
   in the Ganges basin but it is present in two common subdivisions in the
   Brahmaputra and Meghna basins.}},

Abstract = {{Simple analytical calculations of groundwater flow around wells usually
   employ the Thiem well formula for steady calculations and the Theis
   formula for transient calculations. The superposition principle can be
   used with both formulas and even for combinations of both formulas. It
   is generally assumed that flow converges to a steady state when the
   boundary conditions remain constant for a long time. However, the heads
   in Theis's formula do not converge to steady heads for large times,
   although the (specific) discharges do converge to those of the steady
   Thiem well. This undesirable behaviour of the Theis solution can be
   compensated by means of a new function: the ring well. The ring well is
   a combination of Theis's well and Glover's well (solution for a
   transient well in a circular island). A second function, uniform
   recharge during a time interval, is needed to assure that the heads
   converge at a specific level. The functions also allow an analytical
   transition with Theis wells between any two steady states consisting of
   Thiem wells. The functions do not have a wide range of practical
   applications but they increase insight into the relationship between the
   two main functions in groundwater flow.}},

Abstract = {{The snow and rain in the Himalayas are the main sources of supply for
   the rivers in the Indo-Gangetic plains. Irrigation, hydropower
   generation, and water supply are very much dependent on the availability
   of water in the Himalaya rivers. Mathematical models serve as important
   aids for the estimation of water availability in rivers. In the present
   study the SLURP watershed model is applied to a rainfed area of the
   Satluj catchment located in the western Himalayas, India. The SLURP
   model developed at NHRI, Canada, is a distributed conceptual model which
   simulates the behaviour of a watershed by carrying out vertical water
   balances for each element of a matrix of landcovers and subareas of a
   watershed and then routing the resulting runoff between subareas. The
   ILWIS geographic information system was used to prepare the input data
   required for SLURP and land use data were obtained from the IRS
   satellite LISS II visible and near infrared sensors. The simulated flows
   at the Bhakhra Dam outlet of the Satluj catchment were computed and
   found to compare well with the observed flows.}},

Abstract = {{Control of summer river temperature is needed for maintaining water
   temperature standards to protect aquatic biota and wildlife habitats.
   Given the fact that instream discharge, among meteorological and
   hydrological factors, may be the only one that can be practically
   managed, is it feasible to moderate summer river temperature through
   reservoir and streamflow regulations? An analysis is conducted to
   quantify the effects of the magnitude of instream flow on summer river
   temperature with weather as a reference. Relationships between water
   temperature and river discharge or flow depth are developed using a
   simplified model and adopting the concept of equilibrium temperature and
   bulk surface heat exchange coefficient. The relationships are validated
   against continuous 5-year field measurements at the central Platte
   River, Nebraska, USA. It was found that the variation of daily maximum
   water temperature with now was stronger than that of daily mean. A
   critical discharge was obtained, which divides dramatic drop and slow
   variation in river temperature values. The existence of the critical
   discharge makes it possible to reduce or minimize the occurrence of
   daily maximum water temperature exceeding a standard at a river reach by
   increasing discharge to an achievable level. This study advances
   understanding of impacts of instream flow on summer river temperature
   and provides information useful in proper planning and design of
   reservoir operations and streamflow management.}},

   Then, the spatial rainfall for a gauge is estimated from point
   measurements at neighbouring stations and the station in question,
   following some criteria relevant to climatic conditions of the region.
   The results of applying this method to the Massili drainage basin,
   Burkina Faso, are presented here.}},

Abstract = {{In the countries around the Guinea Gulf, the rainfall regime has varied
   since the end of the 1960s. To specify some characteristics of this
   variability, time series of annual amount of precipitation, rainy season
   duration, amount of precipitation in dry seasons, and number of rainy
   days have been generated with a one-year time step from 1950 to 1989.
   Statistical procedures have been used to test the presence of a shift in
   the mean. To characterize the change in space and in time, the results
   of the tests have been synthesized using multiple correspondence
   analyses. This study reveals that the rainfall regime began to change
   around 1966 in Senegal and Guinea Bissau, and then in Guinea, Mall,
   Burkina Faso and the northern part of Benin. The Ivory Coast, Togo and
   the south of Benin have been affected to various degrees. In Cameroon
   and the Central African Republic, the change is not uniform or has been
   slight.}},

Abstract = {{In the arid and semiarid areas of West and Central Africa, the scarcity
   of the water resources is an old and well-known notion. However, the
   drought, which has been observed in the tropical regions of Africa for
   the last two decades, shows notable harshness, persistence and
   extension. Annual rainfall time series registered over long duration for
   a set of stations all over non-Sahelian West and Central Africa have
   allowed the study of spatial and temporal rainfall evolution in this
   region. Results confirm the existence of an alternation of dry and wet
   periods since the beginning of the twentieth century. However, the
   current drought has no equivalent, neither regarding duration nor
   intensity, throughout the studied period. Nevertheless the strong
   spatial heterogeneity of the phenomenon is underlined by both a
   statistical study and some mapping.}},

Abstract = {{The use of remote sensing information in operational hydrology is
   relatively limited, but specific examples can be cited for determining
   precipitation, soil moisture, groundwater, snow, surface water and basin
   characteristics. The application of remote sensing in hydrology can be
   termed operational if at least one of two conditions are met: (a) the
   application produces an output on a regular basis, or (b) the remote
   sensing data are used regularly on a continuing basis as part of a
   procedure to solve a problem or make decisions. When surveying the
   various operational applications, simple approaches and simple remote
   sensing data sets are the most successful. In the data-sparse developing
   countries, many operational remote sensing approaches exist (out of
   necessity) that may not be needed in developed countries because of
   existing data networks. To increase the use of remote sensing in
   operational hydrology in developed countries, pilot projects need to be
   increased and information services must be improved. Increased
   utilization of GIS to combine remote sensing with other information will
   promote new products and applications. End user training must be
   improved by focusing on satellite data processing and manipulation. In
   developing countries the same improvements are needed plus some more
   basic ones. There is a need for international monetary assistance to
   establish long-term remote sensing data, improved database systems and
   image processing capabilities. There is also the need to set up
   innovative regional training centres throughout the developing world.}},

Abstract = {{On the basis of the degree of mineralization, the groundwater of
   Apan-Tochac sub-basin may be considered as fresh (TDS < 500 ppm).
   However, chlorination is necessary to make it fit for human consumption.
   Major ion analyses of over 235 water samples reveal a striking
   relationship between hydrochemical evolution and the groundwater flow
   system. A high content of total dissolved solids, and low values of the
   Ca:Mg ratio are present in wells located on the plain (discharge zone),
   whereas opposite conditions are associated with wells located in higher
   regions (recharge zone). Statistical data analysis using the method of
   principal components allowed to differentiation of two hydrochemical
   families: (a) low mineralization corresponding to the recharge zone, and
   (b) high mineralization corresponding to the discharge zone. Waters of
   the Ca + Mg + HCO3, and Na + Mg + HCO3 hydrochemical facies are present
   and the former is dominant, The water is slightly alkaline, having
   slight problems of salinity during the year owing mainly to Ca2+HCO3-
   and Na+Cl- salts. The hydrochemistry of the groundwater reflects the
   pattern of local groundwater flow for this sub-basin.}},

Abstract = {{Two types of monthly water balance models at basin scale are used: PE
   models use precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) as their
   observed input data, whereas P models need only precipitation.
   Calibration proceeds by comparing model runoff and observed runoff.
   Calibration is entirely automatic with the exclusion of subjective
   elements. All models differ only by their actual evapotranspiration
   equations. PE models from previous papers are generalized essentially by
   replacing the constant evapotranspiration parameter by a periodic one,
   thus increasing the number of parameters by two (a ``parameter{''} is an
   unknown constant to be estimated, and which is a characteristic of the
   river basin to be described). P models use a periodic ``driving
   force{''}, which is intended to represent periodicity of hydrological
   phenomena, normally originating in the (unavailable) PET time series.
   These eight PE models and three P models are then applied to 55 river
   basins in 10 countries with widely diverging climates and soil
   conditions. A marked improvement of model performance in about one third
   of the basins is due to the introduction of the above mentioned periodic
   functions. Even when PET data are available it is sometimes useful to
   consider P models. P models scarcely perform less well than PE models.
   An engineer, wanting to try out as few models as possible on a given
   river basin, can restrict his attention to the optimization of two or
   three models. The paper is an extension of a long effort towards monthly
   water balance models, and is believed to give a solution in most
   circumstances}},

Abstract = {{The main contributors of high nitrate concentrations in the groundwater
   of the Vamsadhara River basin are the point sources associated with
   livestock barns while the seasonal variations in nitrate (NO3)

   conditions. The observed increase in nitrate under rising water level
   conditions, contradicting an expected decrease due to dilution by
   rainwater, is believed to be caused by the contribution of NO3 from the
   clayey soil. The processes of sorption, retention and slow
   denitrification in clay are probably responsible for the contribution of
   nitrate to the groundwater in the post-monsoon season. The positive
   linear relationship between chloride and nitrate is in agreement with
   the similarities in behaviour of these ions in the clayey formations.}},

   Although a general exponential decrease in deposition rate and grain
   size with distance from the channel occurs, significant deviations from
   these trends are associated with the microtopography of the flood plain
   and secondary flow routes and, in particular, with ditches. The coarsest
   material and the greatest variability in deposition rates occur within a
   few metres of the channel. Similar trends are evident for mean particle
   size, percentage silt and clay, arithmetic sorting and skewness. These
   parameters also display substantial variation at the distal margins of
   the flood plain due to the presence of drainage ditches.}},

   the daily and monthly mean flows in four hydrometric stations in the
   River Miliane watershed as well as the daily mean levels in the Bir

   daily mean flows are reconstituted with a Nash coefficient varying
   between 0.88 and 0.97. The relative bias obtained ranged between -2.3
   and -4.7\%. For the extreme flows, however, the bias values are greater.
   The analysis of residual series shows that the residuals are
   homogeneous. Residuals are not serially independent, but they are
   spatially independent. During the validation period
   (1975/1976-1976/1977), correlation and Nash coefficients were degraded

Abstract = {{In semiarid regions, periods of one to several consecutive months of
   scarcity of precipitation or low flow rates in rivers and streams
   frequently occur. In these regions, scarce precipitation considerably
   affects grazing activities od rangelands, irrigation agriculture, and
   flora and fauna of surface stream environments. This paper is concerned
   with estimating probabilities of occurrence for such events and
   associated risks by using statistical information provided by monthly
   precipitation and streamflow series. Conventional return period and risk
   concepts as customarily used in hydrology are applied, and events of
   interest such as meteorological droughts are considered by using monthly
   precipitation as a time-related series of supply, thereafter addressing
   hydrological droughts in terms of streamflow supply. For these two kinds
   of events, periodic situations of time-independent phenomena are
   considered for the case of precipitation, with time-dependent phenomena
   considered for streamflows. The method is applied to the semiarid
   portion of Chile to calculate probabilities of occurrence of specific
   numbers of consecutive months with no significant precipitation, or now
   rates insufficient to meet stream ecological needs.}},

   Nature Reserve and sites close by in the northern Pennines are analysed
   in order to place observations made since 1991 as part of the UK
   Environmental Change Network (ECN) in context. Rainfall records for the
   Durham Observatory since 1880 and streamflow for the River Wear at
   Durham since 1958 provide a regional setting within which the upland
   records can be assessed. Since 1991, the most notable event has been the
   drought of the 1995 summer which followed one of the wettest winters on
   record. A strong tendency is noted for increased hydrological
   variability recently, with the contrast between winter and summer
   becoming more extreme, both for rainfall and runoff.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents new calculations of Lake Victoria's water balance.
   Evaporation is estimated using both the Penman formula and die energy
   balance approach, and sensitivity studies are performed to determine the
   influence of input data on the estimates. Rainfall over the lake is
   estimated from catchment rainfall using a relationship between the two
   that was derived using satellite data. The results, using the reference
   period 1956-1978, indicate that mean annual rainfall over the lake is
   1791 mm, compared to mean annual evaporation of 1551 mm. When compared
   with lake level changes, tributary inflow, and discharge during this
   period, there is a resultant imbalance of 19 mm. Adding this amount to
   the calculated evaporation, we are able to reproduce with great accuracy
   the lake level changes during the period 1956-1978 utilizing
   precipitation estimates of this study plus measured inflow and
   discharge. Sensitivity studies show that the discrepancy in the balance
   of 19 mm is considerably smaller than the error in evaporation
   calculations that can be introduced by uncertainties in the input data.
   Of particular concern is cloudiness. The diurnal cycle of cloudiness is
   quite different over the lake than at shoreline stations and the total
   cloud cover over the lake is probably lower than at these stations. A
   change from 50\% cloudiness to 30\% can increase evaporation by about
   30\%. Thus, this study underscores the need for adequate cloud data,
   sufficient to resolve the diurnal cycle, as well as direct estimates of
   lake rainfall in assessing the lake's water balance.}},

Abstract = {{Surface soil moisture, defined here as the volumetric soil water content
   in the top 10 cm of the soil, shows a great deal of variability. The
   variance observed within a square metre can be as large as for a whole
   field. For that reason alone, point measurements in low quantities
   cannot be representative for the average soil moisture of a whole field.
   Soil moisture estimated by remote sensing techniques, especially by
   microwave sensors, might give adequate information on areally averaged
   soil moisture. If these techniques are to be worthwhile in hydrological
   modelling, it will be necessary to link the various spatial resolutions
   of the different instruments to each other and to point-scale
   measurements. Despite differences in instrument configuration it is
   shown that it is possible, under certain circumstances, to downscale
   high resolution areal soil moisture estimates to low resolution soil
   moisture estimates using data from HAPEX-Sahel'92 and Washita'94.}},

   emissivity at 1.4 GHz (e(app)) and the average water content of the
   upper 2 cm of the profile (theta(0-2)) are differences in the dielectric
   properties. A simple semi-empirical model is proposed, based on the
   effect of soil particle size distribution on bound/free water
   partitioning, which provides a calibration between e(app) and
   theta(0-2). Although, in principle, the detailed shape of the water
   content distribution close to the surface will influence the
   e(app)/theta(0-2) relationship, such effects are only significant during
   short periods (<1 h) following the onset of rainfall which produces
   steep wetting fronts close to the soil surface.}},

Abstract = {{Knowing the root distribution in soil is essential for estimating water
   uptake by plant roots. It is difficult, however, to characterize and
   model undisturbed root systems. Root development in a two-dimensional
   potential field is simulated with the dielectric breakdown model (DBM),
   which implies a similarity between electric discharge and root
   distribution. A weighted potential gradient with an exponent II was used
   to create probability distributions of root growth. Each root was
   generated step-by-step by selecting random numbers from probability
   distributions. Simulations were performed for point sources and
   horizontal line sources. In both cases, as eta increased, the root
   system changed from a cluster and dense type to a slender and sparse
   type and the fractal dimension decreased. For a point source of water,
   there was a definite pattern of root development toward the source. It
   is concluded that the DBM effectively describes root development under
   various water conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration experiments with intensities varying from 4.1 x 10(-6) to
   2.8 x 10(-5) m s(-1) were conducted on a column of undisturbed soil.
   Flow was investigated using kinematic wave theory. The approach was
   first applied to the drainage curve of outflow. In this case,
   preferential flow occurred during intermediate infiltration rates. The
   approach was further applied to soil moisture variations at three depths
   of the column. The wetting front dispersion increased with depth
   according to the analysis of mobile soil moisture contributing to total
   now, whereas the analysis of mobile soil moisture contributing to rapid
   flow indicated flow through macropores. The kinematic wave model
   simulates reasonably well both measured drainage of outflow and of soil
   moisture. A simple method was used to separate mobile soil moisture
   contributing to rapid flow and that contributing to diffusive flow. The
   validity of the model was evaluated by water balance comparison, with
   particular attention given to the distinction between the two types of
   soil moisture.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal movement of soil water through a deep vadose zone of a
   sandy hill was studied in the central part of The Netherlands. The
   behaviour of soil water was tracked by monitoring soil water
   fluctuations and changes in the environmental tracer O-18 in vertical
   profiles at test sites with grassland, heathland and forest. In the
   temperate climate of the study area a soil moisture deficit develops
   during summer and a precipitation surplus prevails during winter. The
   O-18 content in precipitation exhibits a distinct seasonal cycle with
   the highest (relatively enriched) values of c. -6 parts per thousand vs
   V-SMOW occurring in summer and the lowest (relatively depleted) values
   of c. -9 parts per thousand vs V-SMOW in winter. The influence of this
   cycle can be traced back in the subsurface to a depth of sometimes more
   than 6 m. This seasonal fluctuation moves around the average annual O-18
   content in rainfall, tending closer to the average as depth increases.
   In the saturated zone the same average value is observed. This suggests
   that, although the precipitation surplus is limited to the winter
   period, part of the summer precipitation also infiltrates to below the
   root zone and contributes to the groundwater recharge. The results of
   this study indicate that preferential flow dominates in the root zone.
   Below the root zone of low homogeneous vegetation covers, the soil water
   movement is dominated by diffuse flow. In forests, a more heterogeneous
   root pattern causes a more preferential type of flow, also at greater
   depths below the root zone.}},

Abstract = {{Catchments with a small elevation range and relatively long dry periods
   in high radiation conditions may be described as an array of vertical
   one-dimensional pathways for water and energy. Such a representation
   makes it possible for Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models
   to simulate mass exchange across the catchment. This note reports on a
   comparison of a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer model and a
   stochastic hydrological model. We have used a stochastically distributed
   one-dimensional SVAT model (SiSPAT), which transfers any runoff
   generated at a particular location instantaneously to the catchment
   outlet. The hydrological model used here is the quasi-distributed
   Variable Infiltration Capacity model of Wood et al. (1992). Our results
   indicate that the uncalibrated SiSPAT model does not yield better
   results than the uncalibrated VIC model. However, even the uncalibrated
   VIC model requires knowledge of the maximum and minimum observed storage
   capacity to derive soil water status. The results also show that a
   calibrated VIC model performs better than the uncalibrated SiSPAT, but
   that minimum storage calibrated against the observed runoff does not
   retain its physical significance, since it is larger than the mean
   storage capacity.}},

Abstract = {{In order to account for subgrid-scale spatial variability
   (heterogeneity) of land surface characteristics in regional-scale
   hydrological-atmospheric models, a land surface parameterization of
   areally-averaged sensible heat and evapotranspiration fluxes which is
   based upon areally-averaged hydrological soil water flow and soil heat
   flow equations, was developed. This land surface parameterization is
   fully coupled in a two-way interaction with the atmospheric boundary
   layer and the regional atmospheric model's first layer. The
   Monin-Obukhov similarity theory which is utilized in modelling the
   atmospheric boundary layer, and the areally-averaged hydrological
   conservation equations are strictly valid only over
   stationary-heterogeneous areas where the fluctuations of the
   hydrological and boundary layer state variable values, parameter values,
   and of boundary conditions have spatially invariant means, spatially
   invariant higher moments and spatially invariant probability
   distributions. Therefore, the coupled two-way interactive model was run
   first for the computation of land surface fluxes over
   stationary-heterogeneous land patches, each corresponding to a single
   soil texture-vegetation class. Then, utilizing a mosaic scheme, the land
   surface fluxes over a regional model grid cell were obtained by
   numerical probabilistic averaging. The application of the regional model
   with this land surface parameterization to California during April 1989
   has produced promising results.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of soil moisture and temperature states are forced by land
   surface fluxes that form the coupling between the soil and the
   atmosphere. This two-way interaction between the soil and the atmosphere
   results in feedback mechanisms that affect the temporal patterns of
   variability of the system. To understand these characteristics of soil
   moisture and temperature variability, a one-dimensional coupled
   mixed-layer model of the land surface and the planetary boundary layer
   energy and humidity budgets is constructed. To allow integrations on the
   order of days, the model includes both the growth phase and the collapse
   phase of mixed layer evolution. The model includes the radiative effects
   due to the presence of clouds. Given the incoming shortwave radiation,
   lapse rates of temperature and humidity above the mixed layer and
   lateral windspeed, the model predicts all longwave radiative and
   turbulent surface heat fluxes. The model is shown to capture accurately
   observations taken during the FIFE field experiment. With this model,
   the impact of soil heterogeneity on the evolution of the surface and
   mixed-layer energy and humidity budgets is examined, using hydraulic
   properties from sand, loam and clay soils. It is assumed that the small
   correlation length scale of soil hydraulic properties and surface
   inhomogeneities are averaged out in the mixed layer. Relative to a
   uniform soil, heterogeneity increases the spatial mean latent heat flux
   for conductive soils and decreases it for unconductive soils, due to
   decreased and increased percolation respectively. Locally decreasing
   latent heat fluxes cause a warmer and drier mixed layer and through that
   an increase of the latent heat flux over other areas. This mixed-layer
   feedback reduces the impact of heterogeneous surface fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{A package of simulation models has been developed to study the
   hydrological processes controlling runoff and to predict flow
   hydrographs in the Indian arid zone. The models describe rainfall-runoff
   in the upland phase and the interaction between runoff and transmission
   losses in the channel phase, so as to derive the drainage basin outflow
   hydrograph. In the upland phase the rising limb of the hydrograph is
   predicted through a regression model and the recession through a
   conceptual analogue of discharge from a single leaky reservoir. The
   leaky reservoir is described by a continuity equation and by
   discharge-stage and storage-stage relationships at the outlet. In the
   channel phase the governing equations for movement of a flood wave
   subjected to the transmission losses are simplified through a time
   averaging process to develop an ordinary differential equation
   describing transmission losses as a function of distance, inflow,
   channel width, time parameters of flow and effective hydraulic
   conductivity. These models are simplified acid developed to require a
   minimum of observed data for calibration. The package of models can be
   applied to ungauged drainage basins through parameterization.}},

   including a random input term is proposed to describe and estimate the

   expression of risk for flood release is given and the probability
   density functions of the reservoir level hydrograph, which are related
   to the risk of overtopping failure, are computed using a Fokker-Planck
   equation. Analysed and calculated results indicate that, by using the
   stochastic differential equations, the uncertainty influence of various
   random factors on the reservoir level hydrograph can be taken into
   account in the flood routing process. Therefore, the procedure of
   evaluating the risk of dam overtopping failure developed in this paper

Abstract = {{Microscale-averaged inter-rill area sheet flow and rill now equations
   (Tayfur \& Kavvas, 1994) are averaged along the inter-rill area length
   and rill length to obtain local areally-averaged inter-rill area sheet
   flow and rill flow equations (local-scale areal averaging). In this
   averaging, the local areally-averaged flow depths are related to the
   microscale-averaged flow depths at the outlet sections (downstream ends)
   of a rill and an inter-rill area by the assumption that the flow in
   these sections has the profile of a sine function. The resulting local
   areally-averaged now equations become time dependent only. To minimize
   computational efforts and economize on the number of model parameters,
   local areally-averaged flow equations are then averaged over a whole
   hillslope section (hillslope-scale areal averaging). The expectations of
   the terms containing more than one variable are obtained by the method
   of regular perturbation. Comparison of model results with observed data
   is satisfactory. The comparison of the model results with those of
   previously developed models which use point-scale and large-scale

Abstract = {{A survey of the River Kali in western Uttar Pradesh (India) has been
   carried out to assess the contribution of point and non-point sources of
   pollution to the river. The river shows strong seasonal dependence for
   various constituents and the water quality deteriorates sharply as it
   flows through Muzaffarnagar city. The important characteristic
   associated with the pollution of the river is the depletion of oxygen
   over a stretch of about 25 km. High values of BOD and COD indicate a
   high degree of organic pollution in the river. A chemical mass balance
   approach has been used for measuring changes in the concentration and/or
   load to the river, which develops an interesting concept to discriminate
   between point and non-point sources of pollution to the river. The
   resulting differential loadings, if adjusted for uncharacterized
   non-point contribution to the load, may represent the total point source
   load to the river minus any losses due to volatilization, settling,
   and/or degradation. Mass balance calculations conducted for certain
   water quality constituents indicated that additional inputs are needed
   to account for the observed differences in load along the river. The
   sources may include non-point sources of pollution due to agricultural
   activities, sediment remobilization or entrainment, groundwater
   intrusion or a combination of these sources. The difference may also be
   attributed to some point sources of pollution which could not be
   identified in the course of these investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Studies using data from a general circulation model (GCM) and from
   numerical weather prediction models (NWP) as inputs to a hydrological
   model have produced useful results but were limited by the coarse
   resolution of the GCM data on the one hand and, on the other hand, by
   the relatively short period of high-resolution NWP data available. This
   paper describes an alternative approach using long-term (96 years) daily
   data from a high resolution atmospheric boundary layer model. The data
   from the atmospheric model were used as inputs to a daily distributed
   hydrological model of the Upper Columbia Basin in western Canada. The
   hydrological model was calibrated for five years and verified using
   streamflow and other data for a further 18 years. It was found that the
   hydrological model was able to simulate snowpack and streamflow data for
   the total period of 96 years of available atmospheric model output with
   good success. This method provides the opportunity for analysis of water
   resources systems under alternative climate and land-use scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{This study illustrates the association between annual and seasonal
   streamflow characteristics on six Costa Rican rivers and the Southern
   Oscillation Index (SOI). Annual discharge from rivers within the Pacific
   watershed are clearly positively associated with contemporary values of
   the SOI and experience significant reductions in both mean and variance
   in El Nino years. The considerable practical implications of this
   finding to a country in which over 60\% of national electrical power
   comes from hydroelectric schemes is illustrated using quantile estimates
   from various models. Rivers draining towards the Caribbean show less
   clear and coherent patterns of associations. The observed associations
   with seasonal flows on some rivers appear to be the opposite of those on
   the Pacific, and may even vary during the course of a year at a site.
   The exact nature of the response seems to be closely related to the
   elevation of the gauge site. The larger the proportion of the basin at
   elevations above about 500-1000 m the greater the similarity to the
   Pacific pattern, suggesting that the marked topographic divide between
   the two coastal watersheds does not correspond to the divide in
   associations between streamflow and the SOI.}},

Abstract = {{Both the theoretical basis of a distributed approach to sediment
   delivery and its agreement with basin sediment yield measurements are
   tested. At first, by using morphological data of five Apulian and four
   Calabrian basins, the applicability of a theoretically-based
   relationship for evaluating the sediment delivery ratio of each
   morphological unit SDRi, into which a basin is divided, is verified.
   Using the morphological data of the nine investigated basins, the
   sediment delivery relationship, i.e. the relationship of the basin
   sediment delivery ratio SDRW, and SDRi, is tested. The analysis showed
   that the relationships, proposed by Ferro (1997), establishing the
   dependence of the a coefficient of the sediment delivery relationship on
   the median travel time and on a drainage density index are yet
   applicable. The influence of the scale of the basin topographic map on
   the sediment delivery distributed approach is also studied. The analysis
   showed that the ratio between the a coefficient and the median travel
   time is scale-invariable while the link between the coefficient a and
   the drainage density index has to be re-calibrated because the drainage
   density index is dependent on the map scale used. Finally, the
   predictive capability of the sediment delivery distributed model is
   validated using the sediment yield measurements carried out in three
   small Calabrian basins and in the Apulian Triolo basin. The analysis
   showed that the model accuracy is dependent on the temporal scale used
   and the model reliability increases from the event to the annual scale.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we present the results of the comparison of three
   different algorithms: the Genetic Algorithm coupled with Sequential
   Quadratic Programming (GA-SQP), the Pattern Search also coupled with SQP
   (PS-SQP) and the Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA), The analyses were
   conducted using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model applied both to a
   single basin and to a complex basin, For both types of basin, a
   theoretical case without model and data errors was considered, in which
   the true values of the parameters are known a priori, and several
   real-world cases where model and data errors exist. With reference to
   the single basin, the SCE-UA algorithm was the most reliable while the
   other two algorithms gave solutions equivalent to those of the SCE-UA in
   the theoretical case, but in the real-world cases they showed an
   increasing tendency (particularly the PS-SQP) to be trapped in local
   minima. With reference to the complex basin, none of the three
   algorithms identified the exact solution in the theoretical case.
   However, the SCE-UA was the one which systematically approximated it
   better than the others, In the real-world case its solutions were stable
   but characterized by many parameter values set at the boundary of their
   own range. The other two algorithms produced a very unstable set of
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of various water management alternatives, resulting from the
   construction of the La Vinuela reservoir system (Malaga, Spain), on the
   hydrological regime of the coastal aquifer of the Velez River has been
   analysed. In particular, steady-state simulations of the freshwater
   regime have been carried out under various possible management policies
   for this reservoir system. For this purpose, a finite element model was
   used, which was designed to take into account the relationship between
   the groundwater and surface water, the different hypotheses for the
   mixture of freshwater and saltwater, and the special treatment of the
   open boundaries of the aquifer at the coastline. The simulations
   consider average freshwater inputs as well as different water management
   and exploitation alternatives for surplus and deficit of freshwater. The
   accomplished simulations provide the phreatic levels, the active
   drainage network and the thicknesses of freshwater and saltwater as a
   result of the advance of the saltwater interface. The results of the
   simulations appear to be reliable according to the existing experimental
   data on the region. The simulation alternatives illustrate the main
   limitations of the aquifer for storing and transmitting freshwater, and
   preventing the advance of saltwater intrusion resulting from the
   exploitation by pumping in wells and water management policies in the La
   Vinuela reservoir system.}},

Abstract = {{An integrated model is developed for short-term yearly reservoir
   operation for irrigation of multiple crops. The model optimizes a
   measure of annual crop production, starting from the current period in

   already achieved up to the beginning of the period are used as inputs to
   the model. The solution specifies the reservoir release and optimal
   irrigation allocations to individual crops during an intra-seasonal
   period, The model overcomes some of the limitations of an earlier model
   developed by Mujumdar \& Ramesh (1997) by replacing the two dynamic
   programming (DP) formulations with a single linear programming (LP)
   formulation. Application of the model is studied through a case study in

Abstract = {{The disconnection of sewered impervious areas is a measure to reduce the
   overflow frequency and hydraulic load of both combined and improved
   separate sewer systems. In this article the sizing of disconnection
   facilities is elaborated. The usual procedures for determining the
   required dimensions of the facilities contain some spurious assumptions.
   These assumptions have been removed, resulting in a more realistic
   design procedure for disconnection facilities to make sure that the
   discharge of stormwater is guaranteed. With the use of simulations
   various design graphs have been constructed. In the graphs the
   permeability of the soil (K value) is plotted against the required
   construction length of the facility (L value) scaled to the amount of
   connected impervious area. For a known K value, a known amount of
   impervious area and a chosen cross-section of the facility, the required
   construction length can be assessed directly from the graphs. The effect
   of a discharge drain at the bottom of a percolation trench has also been
   investigated. It appeared that, compared to a facility without a drain,
   the required dimensions of a facility with a drain decrease
   significantly. Consequently, soils with low permeability allow the
   application of percolation facilities, provided that a discharge drain
   is installed at the bottom of the facility. As the drain prevents
   groundwater filling the facility, the facility with a drain can be
   applied in areas with relatively high groundwater levels, as occur in
   many cities in the delta and polder areas of The Netherlands.}},

Abstract = {{The Bayesian Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE)
   methodology, previously used in rainfall-runoff modelling, is applied to

   estimates are based on conditioning predictions of Monte Carlo
   realizations of a distributed quasi-two-dimensional flood routing model
   using known levels at sites along the reach. The methodology can be
   applied in the flood forecasting context for which the N-step ahead
   inundation probability estimates can be updated in real time using
   telemetered information on water levels. It is also shown that it is
   possible to condition the N-step ahead forecasts in real time using the

Abstract = {{An important aspect of flood management is the estimation of catchment
   response to storm events by simulation of flood wave propagation through
   the catchment storage. A derivation of the wave speed (c) is presented
   in terms of discharge (Q) and the exponent (m) in the storage
   (S)-discharge relationship S = kQ(m). The wave speed-discharge
   relationship has the form c = (alpha(c)(m)/m)Q(1-m), where alpha(c) is a
   parameter in the kinematic wave model. The parameters in this
   relationship, however, change with flow conditions in the cross section,
   especially as flow leaves the main channel to inundate the floodplain.
   This finding confirms that the parameters in the single
   storage-discharge relationship do not have discrete values as used in
   many runoff-routing models, and hence the use of single parameter values
   is not suitable for estimating floods in many situations. It is shown
   that a more reasonable relationship is S = S-c + k(1)LQ(1/b), where S-c
   is a threshold storage, and the other parameters are functions of the
   flow conditions. The parameters k(1), L, b and also the parameters in
   the wave speed-discharge relationship change between inbank, overbank,
   and fully developed floodplain flow situations. This paper investigates
   the relationship between the kinematic wave exponent (1/beta(c)) and
   discharge that gives an estimate of (lib) which is not provided by the
   wave speed-discharge relationship. This estimate is shown to be
   approximately equal to m, the exponent conventionally used in the
   storage-discharge relationship S = kQ(m). Further, the kinematic wave
   exponent (1/beta(c)) can be approximated by the ratio between the water
   velocity and the flood wave speed. This analysis is used to explain the
   complicated behaviour of wave speed and water velocity in channel,
   overbank, and fully developed floodplain flows.}},

Abstract = {{A confined finite fractured aquifer bounded by a stream on one side and
   by an impervious boundary on the other is considered. Unsteady flow in
   the aquifer resulting from a sudden rise (or drop) of water level in the
   river stage is analysed. The governing differential equations are based
   on the double porosity conceptual model with the assumption of
   pseudo-steady state fracture-to-block flow. By applying finite Fourier
   sine and Laplace transform techniques to the governing equations,
   analytical solutions for the piezometric head distribution are obtained.
   By applying Darcy's law the time-dependent flow rate to (or from) the
   aquifer per unit length of the stream is evaluated. For negligible
   storage coefficient or hydraulic conductivity of the blocks, the new
   solutions reduce to known forms. The proposed analytical solutions may
   be useful in predicting the variations in the water levels in the
   aquifer as well as evaluating the time-dependent flow rates especially
   in the analysis of recession hydrographs in the streams. The solutions
   may also be used for the identification of the aquifer properties and
   for numerical model validation.}},

Abstract = {{Observations with tensiometers and piezometers near the Maurets River in
   the Real Collobrier basin supply interesting information about
   hydrological mechanisms during floods. Series of weekly time-step
   measurements show a good correlation between river flow and piezometric
   levels near the river. These levels can rise only when the soil
   capillary pressure before the storm event is approximately zero. More
   detailed observations of the suction values were recorded with a
   half-hour time step. They show that only high intensity rainfall can
   provoke a quick increase of positive pressures in the soil profiles
   (saturation), as long as these pressures are very close to zero before
   the rain. Associated with these positive pressures a quasi-null vertical
   hydraulic head gradient and a strong flow in the river are observed. In
   such a case, the soil saturation can be of a very short duration.
   Therefore, in Mediterranean conditions, saturated contributing areas can
   appear and develop causing big floods, but they seem to be very limited
   in time.}},

Abstract = {{Three monthly rainfall-runoff models have been applied to semiarid
   catchments within Namibia under the Southern African FRIEND (Flow
   Regimes from International Experimental and Network Data) programme.
   These are the Namrom model, developed specifically for Namibia, and two
   versions of the Pitman model, developed in South Africa and applied
   throughout the southern African region. The models were all calibrated
   on about 20 years of observed flow data and the calibrated parameters
   used to generate 68 years of simulated inflows to reservoirs located at
   the catchment outlets. A reservoir water balance simulation model was
   used with the three inflow series to assess the differences resulting
   from the application of the three models, with respect to estimates of
   the reliable yield. The calibration results for the three models were
   not very different and suggested that the yield estimates would be
   similar. However, the results based on the 68-year inflow records
   produced greater differences in yield which could have serious
   implications for the planning and management of water supply schemes.}},

Abstract = {{A multicomponent reactive transport model, MIN3KIN, has been developed.
   M1N3KIN handles both multiple chemical equilibrium and multiple
   component chemical kinetic reactions. A two-dimensional transport code
   has been coupled with a chemical equilibrium code and a chemical kinetic
   subroutine. A finite element method is used to solve the transport
   equations. Different coupling methods between transport and equilibrium
   calculations are evaluated and chemical equilibrium may be solved
   sequentially or iteratively. MIN3KIN has been evaluated against an
   analytical solution and applications for different coupling schemes and
   temporal discretization. It is shown that the chemical kinetic flux
   should not exceed 10\% of the mass depletion for a given time step.
   Systems with both chemical equilibrium and irreversible chemical
   kinetics reach a condition, where the concentration quotient does not
   correspond with the equilibrium constant. The model is finally applied
   to a two-dimensional case study to illustrate the presence of an
   intermediate aqueous state governed by transport and irreversible
   chemical kinetics.}},

Abstract = {{The International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) is one of
   the seven international associations comprising the International Union
   of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). Each Association has its own domain,
   but the boundaries between them are artificial. The Earth is
   undisciplined, and it does not recognize our academic subjects. In the
   US Academy Report ``Solid-Earth Sciences and Society{''}, published in
   1993, a number of broad objectives and major research areas were set up
   in a matrix which provided a research framework. A remarkable number of
   high-priority research opportunities in the ``solid-Earth Sciences{''}
   are concerned with water, the subject of IAHS. Water is a critical
   material for society and indeed in nearly every topic in Earth science

Abstract = {{The decade of the 1990s has seen an awakening understanding by the
   global community of the importance of freshwater for societal and
   environmental vitality. In 1994, the Scientific Committee on Water
   Research (SCOWAR) was established by the International Council for
   Scientific Unions (ICSU) to address frontier freshwater-related science
   issues. This paper is SCOWAR's review of current trends and burning
   needs in selected areas of water resources research. The key future
   concerns to be served by the results of the research brought under
   review by SCOWAR are identified as equitable sharing of water resources
   and demand management, soil moisture for agriculture, water and health,
   ecological consequences of hydrological change, and improving data
   collection and assessment. SCOWAR also perceives immediate intellectual
   challenges in a number of other areas, such as, inter alia,
   multiple-scale problems, sustainability of reservoirs, dynamics of
   freshwater ecosystems. There is a general recognition that
   unavailability of water in sufficient quality and quantity has been and
   will continue to be an increasingly important constraint on
   socio-economic development. But the situation is not the same all over
   the world. SCOWAR is concerned that much of the increased pressure
   occurs and will occur in particular in Sub-Saharan Africa where high
   population growth and the desire to improve living standards expand
   water requirements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a discussion of the development and application of
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to flow forecasting in mio flood-prone
   UK catchments using real hydrometric data. Given relatively brief
   calibration data sets it was possible to construct robust models of
   15-min flows with six hour lead times for the Rivers Amber and Mole.
   Comparisons were made between the performance of the ANN and those of
   conventional flood forecasting systems. The results obtained for
   validation forecasts were of comparable quality to those obtained from
   operational systems for the River Amber. The ability of the ANN to cope
   with missing data and to ``learn{''} from the event currently being
   forecast in real time makes it an appealing alternative to conventional
   lumped or semi-distributed flood forecasting models. However, further
   research is required to determine the optimum ANN training period for a
   given catchment, season and hydrological contexts.}},

Abstract = {{Despite having the same snowmelt processes, snowpacks in urban
   environments experience a range of conditions different from those of
   rural areas. Melt is intensified at some sites due to greater radiative
   energy. Shading, however, can reduce radiation and melt at other sites.
   Changes to the radiation balance and snowpack processes have been
   investigated. A physical snowpack model was developed and tested against
   data from an impervious study plot in Sweden. Estimated surface runoff
   compared favourably with that measured. An urban radiation scheme
   captured the observed net allwave radiation well. Series of sensitivity
   analyses were made by perturbing the scheme to represent three urban
   locations: open ground and the southern (sunny) and north (shaded) sides
   of a hypothetical building. Cloudiness, albedo, wall temperature and sky
   view were altered to reproduce common urban conditions. Even without
   perturbation, the shaded and sunny sides of the building had different
   radiation fluxes-the south side experienced a daily average net
   radiation enhancement of 15 W m-2 and the north a decrease of 35 W m-2.
   This pattern was reflected in melt, perturbation exaggerated the
   disparity.}},

Abstract = {{Use of output from global Circulation Models (GCMs) by regional or small
   scale rainfall-runoff models necessitates the disaggregation of the
   hydrological information available from GCMs to smaller scales. The
   hydrological processes of interest commonly occur at much smaller scales
   than those being modelled by GCMs. The present work examines the
   disaggregation of areally averaged monthly rainfall values of a basin or
   a region into point rainfall values. It uses some statistical methods
   based on a frequency analysis approach, a correlation approach and a
   disaggregation approach. A total of ten different methods have been
   tried and their relative performances compared based on some error
   criteria evaluated from observed and disaggregated point rainfall and
   mean areal rainfall values and their statistics. The results show the
   superiority of methods based on disaggregation techniques over other
   methods. The methods presented and discussed in the paper may very well
   be applied to disaggregate mean areal rainfall values into point
   rainfall values and also for infilling missing rainfall records.}},

Abstract = {{In a small heterogeneous limestone basin with mixed land use twelve flow
   components were distinguished by using chemographs of flood events and
   baseflow. Only a few of them are endmembers. The number of flow
   components depends on the tracers that are used and on the degree of
   heterogeneity. If the concept of flow components is restricted to
   endmembers only, the runoff generation process cannot be explained
   completely because runoff does not form by the mixing of chemically
   distinct water types alone. Beside water types, there are all kinds of
   temporal variations ranging from steep gradients to continuous changing,
   e.g. due to incomplete mixing, exhaustion of sources, etc. This means
   that the original concept of flow components should be extended to
   behaviour patterns in order to obtain a basic understanding of the very
   complex process of runoff generation. Furthermore it is an excellent
   approach to facilitate understanding of the temporal variation of water
   quality in flowing waters.}},

Abstract = {{By considering the urbanization process on an overland plane whereby a
   relatively rough permeable surface is replaced by a relatively smooth
   impermeable surface, the effect of urbanization on the time of
   concentration is assessed. In the assessment, two opposing urbanization
   sequences are considered: one from downstream to upstream, ant the other
   from upstream to downstream. The assessment is carried out in terms of
   the individual effect as well as the combined effect of the Manning
   resistance coefficient and the runoff coefficient. For both urbanization
   sequences and for all degrees of urbanization, the assessment shows that
   surface conversion from rough to smooth or from permeable to impermeable
   causes the time of concentration to be shorter. Urbanization at the
   upstream end causes the greatest decrease in the time of concentration,
   and the reduction in surface roughness causes a greater decrease in time
   of concentration as compared to the reduction in permeability. Depending
   on the pre- and post-urbanization land surface conditions, the
   assessment shows that the time of concentration could decrease to 4-39\%
   of its original value. Moreover, the time of concentration for a plane
   with urbanization from downstream to upstream could be more than four
   times longer than that for a plane with urbanization from upstream to
   downstream. Finally, there is a remarkable resemblance between the
   results of this study with those obtained from drainage basins in
   earlier studies, and it appears that the results from earlier studies
   are only applicable for the upstream to downstream urbanization
   sequence.}},

Abstract = {{The important elements of a drought phenomenon are the longest duration
   and the largest severity for a desired return period. These elements
   form a basis for designing water storage systems to cope with droughts.
   At times, a third element, drought intensity, is also used and is
   defined as the ratio of severity to duration. The commonly available
   statistics for the causative drought variables such as annual rainfall
   or runoff sequences are the mean, the coefficient of variation and the
   lag one serial correlation coefficient, and occasionally some indication
   of the probability distribution function (pdf) of the sequences. The
   extremal values of the duration and severity are modelled in the present
   paper using information on the aforesaid parameters at the truncation
   level equal to the mean of the drought sequence, which is generally
   taken as the truncation level in the analysis of droughts. The drought
   severity has been modelled as the product of the duration and intensity
   with the assumption of independence between them. An estimate of drought
   intensity has been realized from the concept of the truncated normal
   distribution of the standardized form of the drought sequences in the
   normalized domain. A formula in terms of the extremal severity and the
   T-year return period has been suggested similar to the flood frequency
   formulae, commonly cited in hydrological texts.}},

Abstract = {{Manantali is a multi-purpose reservoir on the upper Senegal River. Among
   its operational objectives, conventional flood management required for
   traditional flood plain farming causes, during below average water
   years, significant losses of electric power production and reduction of
   water stored for irrigation. Rules are proposed for an economical
   variable management policy which incorporates coincident flow peaks on
   uncontrolled tributaries for which 10-day forecasts are made. A daily
   numerical simulation shows that variable flood management compared with
   fixed-date management gives, during dry years, important benefits in
   electric power production and maintains flood frequency behaviour better
   than that of the natural regime.}},

Abstract = {{A method has been developed in the present study for the determination
   of the sediment yield from a catchment using a GIS. The method involves
   spatial disaggregation of the catchment into cells having uniform soil
   erosion characteristics. The surface erosion from each of the
   discretized cells is routed to the catchment outlet using the concept of
   sediment delivery ratio, which is defined as a function of the area of a
   cell covered by forest. The sediment yield of the catchment is defined
   as the sum of the sediments delivered by each of the cells. The spatial
   discretization of the catchment and the derivation of the physical
   parameters related to erosion in the cells are performed through a GIS
   technique using the Integrated Land and Water Information Systems
   (ILWIS) package.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrogeological conditions of a region strongly influence the low
   flow behaviour of river systems. The quantification of the
   hydrogeological conditions of a catchment and the application of
   hydrogeology for estimation purposes is very difficult. Up till now only
   a few solutions are found in the literature. This paper discusses a
   river network approach using hydrogeological conditions to estimate mean
   annual ten-day minima of discharge. The new method allows one to
   estimate flow parameters not only at a single site in a river stretch
   but also in space. The method has been tested on a data set in southwest
   Germany. The results showed a good agreement between the estimated
   discharges and the empirical data. The new method is therefore
   considered to be a useful tool, in particular for water management
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical modelling of overbank inundation and flows faces many
   problems and is still in its infancy. Work to date has generally been
   restricted to small reaches. Large-scale models based on longer reaches
   of river channel are likely to be of greater value for engineering and
   flood plain management purposes, but the problems associated with the
   transition from small to large scales need to be assessed. A large-scale
   finite element model, RMA-2, has been applied to the flood plain of the
   lower reaches of the River Culm in southeast Devon, UK. Patterns of
   radiocaesium accumulation by overbank accretion during flood water
   inundation were used to assess the potential of using such models for
   explaining sedimentation rates and patterns. A strong correlation was
   found between values of the (137)Cs inventory and surface concentration
   and the predicted flood water patterns derived using the RMA-2 model.
   Except where recession pondage occurs, an inverse relationship existed
   between (137)Cs deposition and water depth. However, the discretization
   model developed cannot presently cope with large-scale
   compartmentalization of flows by barriers to flow and small-scale local
   features, such as ditches crossing the flood plain and the
   microtopography of the flood plain. This study appraises the potential
   for using the RMA-2 model to predict patterns of overbank deposition and
   represents an initial stage in the development of an integrated model of
   hydraulic and sediment dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Reports on the occurrence of fluoride in natural water resources and the
   associated health hazards due to human consumption have been made from
   many parts of India during the last decade. With the objective of
   organizing a systematic scientific programme to understand the behaviour
   of fluoride in natural water resources in relation to the local
   hydrogeological and climatic conditions and agricultural use, a typical
   area constituting the lower Vamsadhara River basin was chosen for a
   detailed study. fluoride concentrations in the groundwater reaching a
   maximum of 3.4 mg l(-1) were observed to be associated with weathered
   formations of pyroxene amphibolites and pegmatites. The groundwater in
   the clayey soils contained much less fluoride as compared to the sandy
   soils. The complex depositional pattern of these sandy and clayey soils
   plays an important role in the uneven spatial distribution of fluoride
   in the groundwater. The contribution of fluoride from geological
   formations is far greater than that from agriculture: the maximum yield
   of fluoride by superphosphate fertilizer to irrigation water is observed
   to be 0.34 mg l(-1). The fluoride concentration is expected to be
   increased in the future as the groundwater is subsaturated with respect
   to fluorite. An inverse relationship between F and Ca and positive
   relationships of F with Na, HCO3, PO4 and electrical conductivity were
   observed. Best relationships were obtained in the fluoride range of
   1.0-3.4 mg l(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Following the August 1990 forest fire on the Rimbaud catchment (1.46
   km(2)), studies on hydrological, hydrochemical and erosion response led
   to the development of a decomposition method in hydrograph separation
   between the waters originating from slope runoff and those originating
   from underground flow. Sodium and chloride ions were used as tracers,
   since they are two elements whose concentrations measured in rainfall do
   not undergo any change on contact with the ground after the vegetation
   cover has been destroyed. Tests with O-18 were inconclusive. Two of the
   floods that most typified the post-fire surging characteristics of the
   Rimbaud stream were chosen for decomposition, one at the beginning of
   the hydrological year (27 September 1992 with a rainfall of 72.0 mm) and

   rainfall of 87.7 mm). These two flood events show clear differences in
   the volume of runoff originating from rainfall (total runoff
   coefficient: 18.6\% for September 1992 and 87.5\% for December 1990),
   but similarities in maximum discharge (7.7 and 7.8 m(3) s(-1)) and in
   the quantities of water yielded by slope runoff during the flood itself.

   and 47\% of the total flow during the December 1990 flood.}},

Abstract = {{This study considers the management of an aquifer with artificial
   recharge whose water resources are mainly used for irrigation and where
   the irrigation return flows and natural discharge are considerable.
   These two variables are dependent on the use and increase of water
   resources. The interaction between some inflow and outflow variables is
   taken into account in the computation of the actual volume of water
   available, there being a pre-established artificial recharge of the
   aquifer. Conversely, the artificial recharge for a given water demand
   may be calculated. The most important inflow and outflow variables are
   used in an equation system (the water balance for each period of time)
   for these interactions and the total inflow and outflow. An iterative
   procedure is developed that solves the equation and with it the
   computation of the actual availability of water and storage.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for the design and optimization of
   artificial recharge-pumping systems (ARPS). The objective of ARPS is to
   provide a maximum abstraction rate through artificial recharge, while
   meeting two operational constraints: (a) the influences of the system
   operation on groundwater levels should be no more than 25 mm in the
   vicinity of the system; and (b) the travel time of the infiltrated water
   from the recharge pond to the pumping wells should be more than 60 days.
   The combined use of a 3-dimensional generic groundwater simulation model
   with particle tracking analyses has identified the two best ARPS
   systems: the circular pond system and the island system. By coupling the
   simulation model with linear and mixed integer programming optimization,
   the optimal pumping scheme (number, locations and rates of the pumping
   wells) has been determined. An unsteady state model has been used to
   simulate the response of the operation of the two systems under natural
   seasonal variations. The implementation aspects of the two systems are
   compared.}},

Abstract = {{The basin area of the Ganges River in Bangladesh is extremely dependent
   on a regular water supply from upstream to meet requirements for
   agriculture, fisheries, navigation, salinity control, and domestic and
   industrial sectors. In 1975, India commissioned a barrage on the Ganges
   River at Farakka to divert a significant portion of the dry season flow
   in order to make the Calcutta Port navigable. Statistical analyses of
   discharge and water level data have been carried out to determine if
   significant changes have occurred in the hydrology of the Ganges system
   in Bangladesh in the post-Farakka period. Siltation of the Gorai River
   (an offtake of the Ganges River) has also been examined using the
   stage-discharge relationship and regression analysis. The analyses show
   that the diversion has caused considerable hydrological changes in the
   Ganges system in Bangladesh. The water supply in the dry season has been
   reduced substantially, while siltation of the Gorai River has increased
   significantly.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that the celerity of a discharge wave exceeds
   that of a floodwave. The discharge wave is the initial wavefront (shown
   by an increase in stage at a particular site), whereas the floodwave
   refers to the body of water moving downstream. Yet, few studies have
   investigated the varying relationship between discharge and suspended
   sediment concentration as floods propagate downstream. This paper
   examines the relative velocities of the discharge and sediment waves for
   natural flood events on the River Severn, UK. Four monitoring stations
   were established within the upper 35 km reach of the River Severn
   (drainage basin area 380 km(2)). Discharge was monitored using fixed
   structures, and suspended sediment concentrations were monitored at
   similar locations using Partech IR40C turbidity meters. Results showed
   discharge wave celerity increased with flood magnitude, but
   relationships were more complex for sediment wave celerity. Sediment
   wave celerity was greater than discharge wave celerity, and is
   attributed to the dominant source of sediment, which is most probably
   bank erosion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the assessment of climate change impacts on some
   critical water management issues such as reservoir storage and
   hydroelectric production. Two equilibrium scenarios (UK Meteorological
   Office High Resolution model, UKHI and Canadian Climate Centre model,
   CCC) referring to years 2020, 2050 and 2100 and one transient scenario
   (UK High Resolution Transient output, UKTR) referring to years 2032 and
   2080 were applied to represent both `'greenhouse'' warming and induced
   changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. By using
   these scenarios, the sensitivity of the risk associated with, the annual
   hydroelectric energy production of a large multipurpose reservoir in
   northern Greece has been evaluated under conditions of altered runoff.
   It is shown that the operational characteristics of the reservoir
   designed and operated under current climatic conditions are, in general,
   affected by the climate change scenarios examined. Increases of the
   risks associated with the annual quantities of energy production have
   been observed, particularly under the UKHI and the UKTR scenarios. For
   the UKHI scenario, increases of reservoir storage volumes of up to about
   12\% and 38\% are required in order to maintain at current risk levels
   the minimum and mean annual energy yields respectively, while for the
   UKTR scenario the corresponding increases are estimated to be about 25\%
   and 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{The western part of Albania along the Adriatic Sea is bordered by
   coastal lowlands that are underlain by gravel deposits of Quaternary
   age. These deposits comprise very permeable and laterally extensive
   aquifers that contain large quantities of good quality groundwater that
   can be exploited by means of inducing infiltration from rivers. In
   west-central Albania, the Lushnja plain is underlain by such an aquifer
   (the Lushnja aquifer), which is bounded on the north by the Shkumbin
   River, on the west and east by the Divjaka and Dushku hills, and on the
   south by the Patosi hills and the Seman River. A numerical model using
   the finite difference method with an implicit solution technique was
   used for the first time in Albania to simulate groundwater flow in the
   northern part of the Lushnja aquifer. During the calibration process,
   for existing conditions, the recharge from the Shkumbin River was
   determined to be 0.090 m(3) s(-1). Other inflows to the aquifer in the
   model totalled 0.066 m(3) s(-1). The flow rate of exploitation wells in
   the town of Dushku was determined to be 0.125 m(3) s(-1) as a
   calibration parameter, and the pumping rate of other wells totalled
   0.031 m(3) s(-1). In the calibrated model, the transmissivity of the
   aquifer ranged from 0.0029 to 0.041 m(2) s(-1), and the leakance of the
   riverbed (i.e. the Vertical hydraulic conductivity/thickness of the
   riverbed) of the Shkumbin River ranged from 1.1 x 10(-6) to 3.5 x 10(-6)
   s(-1). After the model was calibrated, it was used to simulate the
   potentiometric surface that would result due to pumping 0.565 m(3) s(-1)
   from exploitation wells proposed for the city of Lushnja and for local
   needs.}},

Abstract = {{A river flow regime, describing the average seasonal pattern of flow,
   reflects climatic and physiographic conditions in a basin. This average
   pattern can be stable, demonstrating the same seasonality in river flow
   from year to year, or unstable, when the flow regime alternates between
   a number of different seasonal patterns. Flow regime types have
   traditionally been used mainly for regionalization purposes. Being
   dependent on climate and physiography, seasonal now regime patterns
   respond to changes in these two factors. In the context of a possible
   climate change, river flow regimes (both type and stability) can be used
   to test the sensitivity of this important river flow characteristic to a
   temperature rise. Such a sensitivity study is reported here on Norwegian
   runoff series modelled for three possible scenarios of a mean annual
   temperature rise in Scandinavia of +1 degrees, +2 degrees and +3 degrees
   C and for different altitudes. The concept of entropy is applied to
   quantify the stability of the seasonal patterns. The study shows that
   the majority of seasonal now regimes are very sensitive to the
   temperature rises studied. Regimes with a snowmelt source of flow
   formation become more unstable, while regime types with a rain source
   become more stable.}},

   fractions. The parameters controlling metal uptake, viz., solution pH,
   sediment dose, contact time, and particle size have been evaluated. The
   optimum contact time needed to reach equilibrium is of the order of 45
   min for both the metal ions. The extent of adsorption increases with an
   increase of pH. Furthermore, the adsorption of the metal ions increases
   with increasing adsorbent doses and decreases with adsorbent particle
   size. The two geochemical phases of iron and manganese oxide act as the
   active support material for the adsorption of the metal ions.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of stable isotope ratios (H-2/H-1 and O-18/O-16) of water
   as a modern tool for palaeoclimatic reconstructions on continents is
   reviewed. Examples of stable isotope records of palaeo-precipitation
   preserved in various continental archives (polar ice sheets, mid-and low
   latitude glaciers, lacustrine deposits, groundwater) are presented, and
   the methodology of their interpretation in terms of climatic changes is
   briefly discussed. To interpret quantitatively the isotope records
   preserved in continental archives, the response of the isotopic
   composition of precipitation to long-term fluctuations of key climatic
   parameters (temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity) over
   the given area should be known. Further, the transfer functions relating
   the climate-induced changes of the isotopic composition of precipitation
   to the isotope record preserved in the given archive should be
   established. Since the isotopic composition of precipitation has been
   monitored only for the past three decades, alternatives ways of
   assessing the long-term climatic sensitivity of the isotopic signature
   of precipitation are being investigated. The isotope composition of
   precipitation should be viewed not only as a powerful proxy climatic
   indicator but also as an additional hydrometeorological parameter which
   should be explored as a diagnostic tool for the modelling of
   climate-induced changes in the water cycle, both on a regional and a
   global scale.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme flood events have been and continue to be one of the most
   important natural hazards responsible for deaths and economic losses.
   Extreme floods result in direct destructive effects during the time of
   the event, and they also may be followed by a related chain of indirect
   calamities such as famines and epidemics that produce additional damages
   and suffering. Extreme hydrological events that have occurred in the
   historical past may also occur in the future. Knowledge about magnitudes
   and recurrence frequencies of past extreme hydrological events in most
   regions are too short to adequately evaluate potential magnitudes and
   recurrence frequencies of extreme hydrological events. Stationary
   climate in which the mean and variance do not change over time is a
   basic underlying assumption of standard methodological procedures for
   estimating recurrence probabilities of extreme hydrological events.
   Palaeo-archives contained in river and lake sediments, fossil plant and
   animal matter, ice layers, and other natural archives show that the
   assumption of stationary climate is not valid when the time scale is
   extended beyond centuries and millennia. Records of past extreme floods
   that occurred long before the period of instrumentation can be
   reconstructed from the distribution of slackwater flood deposits or from
   derivation of water depths competent to transport the largest rocks
   found in flood deposited sediment. Palaeoflood records reconstructed
   from the Upper Mississippi and Lower Colorado River systems in the
   United States confirm nonstationary behaviour of the mean and variance
   in hydrological time series. These stratigraphic records have shown that
   even very modest climatic changes have resulted in very important
   changes in the magnitudes and recurrence frequencies of extreme floods.
   A close relationship was found between the palaeo-flood record of
   extreme floods in the Upper Mississippi River system and a palaeo-record
   of stable isotopes of oxygen and carbon preserved in speleothem calcite
   from a local cave. The relationship suggests that isotopic records
   elsewhere might be calibrated to provide insight about how future
   potential climate changes might impact extreme flood magnitudes and
   recurrence frequencies there. Atmospheric global circulation models
   (GCMs) mainly simulate average climatic conditions and are presently
   inadequate sources of information about how future climate changes might
   be represented at the extreme event scale. Palaeo-flood archives,
   however, provide basic information about how magnitudes and recurrence
   frequencies of extreme hydrological events responded to past climate
   changes and they also provide a reference base against which GCM
   simulations can be calibrated regionally and be better interpreted to
   decipher hydrological information at the extreme event scale.}},

Abstract = {{This paper takes as its starting point today's paradoxical situation
   where a global water crisis is threatening a world in which water
   illiteracy is widespread among those expected to cope with that crisis.
   This creates a huge communication challenge for hydrologists, having to
   brief decision makers, diplomats and politicians in a manner that is
   simplistic without being water-reductionistic. The paper proposes some
   simple explanatory models, to be used for explaining and visualizing
   fundamental man/water interactions, It also discusses environmental
   sustainability criteria and their consequences in terms of the capacity
   to support water dependent populations. Large stress is put on
   land/water interactions. The paper ends with a conceptual framework
   based on the water cycle, distinguishing between rural and urban water
   use, water structures for mobilizing water for such uses, side effects,
   and key points for societal control mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The significance of water availability for sustainable development is
   discussed. A review of water-related areas of concern in Agenda 21, the
   blueprint for sustainability, is offered, with particular reference to
   its Chapter 18 devoted to freshwater resources. The problems of water
   resources of vulnerable areas are tackled for the examples of arid and
   semiarid lands, mountains and small islands. The importance of water
   resources assessment and its building block, hydrological observations,
   for sustainable development is demonstrated and the adverse tendencies
   of declining hydrological observation networks are reported.
   Hydrological network density is seen as one of the indicators of
   sustainable development. Hydrological and water resources systems are
   perceived only as a component of the complex global system. Therefore a
   holistic perspective is advocated, looking at the existing
   interrelationships and interfaces with other sub-systems, including
   social, economic, institutional, etc.}},

Abstract = {{Sustainable development is the new water resources paradigm of the
   1990s. Yet its practical implications seem to be elusive. Metrics for
   measuring the level of sustainability are eagerly sought. It is very
   difficult to capture the important features, and maintain many of the
   valued details, of environmental and social systems when complete or
   appropriate economic accounting is attempted. A much more transcendent
   and flexible metric may be consensus. Consensus as a sustainability
   metric describes the level in which stakeholders are satisfied with a
   solution to a question. Consensus assumes that an appropriate group of
   stakeholders is able to collaborate in assessing proposed solutions to
   environmental problems or development initiatives. It also assumes that
   the collective best which a group of stakeholders has to offer
   implicitly provides insight to the needs of future generations. This
   paper describes an approach for assessing a level of consensus. The
   benefits are: estimation of areas of common understanding; and
   clarification of conflicting values.}},

Abstract = {{Neoclassical economics has only recently considered the problem of
   sustainability-how to provide for the well-being of future generations
   given ecological constraints. In general, the neoclassical economist
   perceives physical and ecological constraints on economy-environment
   interactions as inconveniences that will inevitably be overcome by
   substitution-the discovery of new economic resources or technologies
   allowing the conversion of noneconomic materials to economic goods.
   Ecologists and ecological economists, however, argue that the
   constraints will bind. The debate centres on the relevance of entropy to
   the economics of resource use: irrelevant in the neoclassical view,
   relevant in the ecological. This paper places entropy, within the
   context of neoclassical economic thought, as a limit to economic growth.
   The paper rigorously argues the existence of limits to knowledge and
   consequently to technology and substitution, undermining a basic
   assumption of neoclassical economics and establishing the relevance of
   entropy to economic theories of resource use.}},

Abstract = {{This work develops general fairness measures that may be used as
   criteria for sustainable project selection. Sustainable development,
   fair allocation objectives and empirical distance-based measures of
   fairness, and their evaluation are discussed. Generalized fairness
   measures are developed and extended for both intratemporal and
   intertemporal fairness comparisons. A preliminary application of the
   extended distance based fairness measures is then performed for a case
   study of the selection of an electricity supply project. The case study
   involves selecting between a dispersed diesel energy supply and
   centralized energy supply with land line energy distribution. Due to
   data limitations, the perceived fairness is measured in terms of the
   annual energy costs per megawatt-hour that result from implementing each
   alternative. The applied fairness measures indicate that intratemporal
   fairness, in terms of the distribution of user unit costs, may be
   increased by choosing the land line alternative and that there is no
   significant difference among alternatives with respect to intertemporal
   fairness. These results provide limited insight into the energy supply
   problem, however, and it is suggested that further analyses should be
   conducted when information regarding the environmental impacts and
   reliability of power supply for each of the alternatives becomes
   available.}},

Abstract = {{The need for efficient pipe networks for urban water supply and drainage
   is introduced and discussed in the context of global sustainable
   development. The role of computer based analysis and design tools in the
   planning and operation of such systems is described, with the way in
   which these tools can help to minimize use of resources, energy and
   water losses being explained. In particular, numerical techniques such
   as Genetic Algorithms, which are based on the principles of natural
   evolution, are found to be particularly effective in dealing with the
   large, complex systems that typify urban water distribution networks.
   These evolutionary techniques are introduced and discussed, and several
   applications of the techniques to the development of efficient water
   systems are described. A case study on the use of these techniques in
   the calibration of an accurate mathematical model of an urban water
   distribution system is included.}},

Abstract = {{The needs of reservoirs grow with population, standard of living,
   urbanization in the form of water supply, flood control, hydroelectric
   generation, navigation, recreation etc. Their development inevitably
   involves a substantial degree of environmental impact. The impact of
   reservoirs, on an average, increases in an exponential way with their
   size. If the marginal net benefit were assessed at the margin of the
   capacity, many giant reservoirs for primarily hydroelectric purpose
   would not be justified when the negative environmental impacts are
   counted. The reservoir size should not exceed the size whose marginal
   negative environmental impact becomes more than that of any alternative
   means elsewhere that can provide the same level of incremental gain in
   the global objectives. This is called the least marginal environmental
   impact rule. In order to make such a rule operational, many alternative
   means should be made available that can be sought along a holistic
   approach to water problems, that is, integrated water resources
   management, where a reservoir is only one of many options to be chosen.}},

   50-100 years, up to 1984, are investigated for mean cold season values
   (November to April) for 110 locations in the Former Soviet Union (FSU).
   Following quality checking, statistical analyses are performed on the
   data. There is cold season warming after 1953 or after 1966 over almost
   all the FSU apart from eastern Siberia, but temperature variations
   significantly affect the mean snow depths only in some sensitive areas
   of the Caucasus, central Asia, and the western European territory. Mean
   snow depth time series reveal contrasting local trends. Higher
   precipitation and snow depths are measured in eastern European Russia
   from 50 degrees to 65 degrees N and in some areas of western Siberia at
   the beginning of the twentieth century. Otherwise, precipitation
   variations have little influence on the mean cold season snow depths
   over much of the FSU after 1930. Some predominant periodicities are
   detected for mean cold season temperature, but not for precipitation and
   snow depths.}},

Abstract = {{In August 1975, an extraordinary storm hit the Hongru River basin in
   Henan Province, China. Two dams were overtopped, breached and totally
   destroyed and the river basin experienced a severe flood. Various
   methods for assessing the return period of the peak discharges and
   changes in hydrological response due to the dambreak have been
   investigated: Annual Maximum Series (AMS), Partial Duration Series (PDS)
   and regional analysis. The three approaches gave different estimates of
   the T-year discharge event and of the observed 1975 event, which leads
   to the question whether probability-based methods are applicable for
   very extreme events. Although not capable of giving consistent
   estimates, extreme value analysis shows that the catchment response has
   changed because of the dambreak in 1975, which change in turn can be
   used for future designs. The uncertainty in the estimated design peak
   flows suggests that probability-based estimation methods for
   extrapolation should be complemented with research into historical
   events and simulations based on rainfall-runoff models.}},

Abstract = {{The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is often associated with local search
   optimisation techniques in the calibration process of Conceptual
   Rainfall-Runoff Models (CRRMs) (Wang, 1991; Franchini, 1996), i.e. the
   GA is used for approaching the region encompassing the global solution
   and then its results are used as a starting point for the local
   optimizer in the subsequent `'fine-tuning'' process. However, the GA can
   be formulated in very many ways. This study analyses various GA
   structures and their robustness and efficiency. In addition, a
   sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to their own parameters is
   performed. The analysis is conducted using an Ii-parameter CRRM, called
   A Distributed Model (ADM), applied to both a theoretical case without
   model and data errors and two cases of the real world in which there are
   both model and data errors. Finally, assuming the same role as the GA
   for the `'Pattern Search'' (PS) method in a two-step optimisation
   technique (Hendrickson et al., 1988), the results of the two algorithms
   are compared, showing that, in the calibration of the ADM, the PS may
   give a slightly superior performance.}},

Abstract = {{The linear mathematical model for springflow suggested by Bear (1979)
   can simulate springflow for an initial instantaneous recharge. A
   springflow model has been developed, using the Bear model and Duhamel's
   approach, which can simulate springflow for time variant recharge. The
   suggested model can also be used to compute the time variant recharge to
   the springflow domain from a given springflow time series. The inverse
   problem, which contains linear recharge terms and nonlinear depletion
   terms, has been solved using the Newton-Raphson method for solving a set
   of nonlinear equations. The model has been tested to compute recharge
   for Kirkgoz spring, a first magnitude karst spring in the Mediterranean
   region of Turkey. The estimated annual recharge computed by the model on
   a monthly basis compared well with the annual recharge which had been
   estimated (Korkmaz, 1990) using the Bear model.}},

Abstract = {{Israel is a small country which experiences wide variations in
   magnitudes of extreme discharges. A consistent model has been
   constructed for prediction of such discharges throughout the country.
   Extreme flow characteristics, geographical proximity, lithology, soils,
   and rainfall properties are the major factors in the delineation of
   relatively homogeneous regions within the country. For each region,
   discharge-area relationships are formulated in association with low
   exceedance probabilities. These relationships follow at-site predictions
   which have been prepared by fitting the log Pearson type III
   distribution to annual maxima series of peak discharges. For catchments
   larger than 100 km(2) in area, the differences between the regional and
   the at-site predictions are small. Relatively high extreme discharges
   are found for the arid area where rainfall depth is low, for an area of
   steep slopes, for areas of low permeable lithology and soils, and for
   areas where the fraction of intense rainfall in the total depth of
   precipitation is high. For large arid catchments, the discharge- area
   relationships exhibit a negative trend. The model is simply applicable
   and appears suitable for other semiarid and arid areas.}},

Abstract = {{Caesium-137 (Cs-137) measurements have been used to investigate the
   delivery of sediment from the hillslopes to a lake which marks the
   downstream limit of the small agricultural Start basin in Devon, UK.
   Total Cs-137 inventories and Cs-137 depth distributions in sediment
   cores were used to estimate that the eroded sediment stored within the
   fields and on the flood plain of the main river was equivalent to
   sediment yields of ca. 21 and 30 t km(-2) year(-1), respectively. Based
   on published information on sediment accumulation in the lake, the
   minerogenic sediment yield from the basin was estimated to be ca. 29 t
   km(-2) year. The erosion rate on the hillslopes in the basin, calculated
   as the sum of the sediment yield to the lake and the two storage
   components, is ca. 80 t km(2) year(-1). Of the soil eroded from the
   slopes more than 60\% is stored at intermediate locations and the
   sediment delivery to the lake is less than 40\%. The calculated soil
   erosion rare for the Start basin is consistent with an estimate of the
   erosion rate for the basin of the nearby Old Mill Reservoir of ca. 63 t
   km(-2) year(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Pressure measurements and records of drill-stem tests (DST) from deep
   petroleum exploration wells in the Anambra basin have been analysed
   together with fluid potential data obtained from over 500 water wells
   drilled in the basin. The analyses indicate the existence of three
   distinct hydraulic systems in the basin, viz.: an upper system with
   hydrostatic formation pressures; a middle system in which pressures are
   just moderately higher than hydrostatic; and a relatively deep system of
   abnormally high formation pressures. The three hydraulic systems
   correspond approximately to three hydrostratigraphic units that are
   clearly discernible from the lithologic logs of boreholes and oil wells
   drilled in the basin. The main fluid in the uppermost hydraulic system
   is circulating meteoric water, and the fluid potential distribution is
   largely governed by the local topography at the surface. Within the
   middle hydrostratigraphic unit, hydraulic heads and fluid energies are
   highest at the basin edge to the east where the major aquifer of the
   unit is exposed, and much lower in the basin centre to the southwest
   where the aquifer is confined. The magnitude and distribution of fluid
   potentials in the two top hydraulic systems suggest that the general
   hydrodynamics of the basin are, to a large extent, responsible for the
   generation of the fluid pressures. In the third and deepest hydraulic
   system, however, the situation is different. The hydraulic heads and
   formation pressures are very high indeed, and cannot be explained purely
   in terms of circulating meteoric waters. Some other fluid energy sources
   must also be active in this part of the basin. The fluid potentials and
   pressures fluctuate very rapidly both laterally and vertically,
   suggesting the existence of distinct flow units within the entire
   system. Each flow unit appears to be hydraulically closed, sealed both
   vertically and horizontally, and characterized by a unique fluid energy
   distribution. The existence of both vertical and horizontal potential
   gradients at depth, especially at the basin centre, indicates that the
   fluids are not static, but mobile, and that the complex movement of
   fluids could be through deep-seated drains. Such fluid movements
   obviously affect the temperatures of the sedimentary layers and could
   also be significant in the migration and accumulation of hydrocarbons in
   the basin.}},

Abstract = {{In hydrological practice, flood routing is rarely achieved using the
   complete Saint-Venant equations. Instead, hydrological methods have been
   developed to provide users with simple methods that are robust yet
   efficient. The lag-and-route method has been widely used but its
   parameters have never been related to the physical parameters of
   channels. Moreover, the linear reservoir in this method is not well
   suited to reproduce effectively actual channel routing. A quadratic
   reservoir coupled with a lag component results in a far more accurate
   method while remaining numerically workable. This latter method depends
   on only two parameters which have been successfully related to physical
   channel features. This simple and efficient method enables one to gain
   insight into the main features of flood propagation in river channels.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the results of a pilot study using data at 12 min
   intervals from 20 miniature temperature dataloggers to establish
   vertical and longitudinal temperature patterns within a river bed. Data
   are presented from two adjacent riffles immediately below the Blithfield
   Reservoir on the River Blithe, Staffordshire, UK, for a five day period
   in July 1994. Hyporheic temperatures were warmer than those of
   groundwater, colder than those of surface water and decreased with depth
   into the river bed. At the heads of the riffles shallow sites (20 cm
   depth) mirrored surface temperature patterns but were on average 1.53
   degrees C cooler while deeper sites (40 cm depth) were 2.60 degrees C
   cooler on average. Hyporheic temperatures lagged behind the surface
   water pattern and lag times increased with depth. Sites at the riffle
   tails generally displayed temperature patterns similar to those of the
   groundwater system: on average, temperatures were 4.32 degrees C cooler
   than surface water temperatures and showed no significant variation.
   Hyporheic temperature patterns at the heads of the riffles suggested
   downwelling surface water, while the tails appeared to be influenced by
   upwelling groundwater. Both riffles displayed similar hyporheic
   temperature patterns but riffle 1 was on average 1.22 degrees C warmer
   per site than riffle 2. Temperature differences between the riffles are
   attributed to bed form and substratum composition. These factors may
   have significant ecological implications including rates of organic
   matter decomposition, invertebrate life cycles and salmonid egg hatching
   times.}},

Abstract = {{Most research on hydrology in developed countries does not emphasize
   problems that are often encountered by hydrologists in developing
   countries, problems such as the scarcity and poor quality of data. In
   developing countries the available data base is often a major constraint
   and a limiting factor in any hydrological study. This paper analyses the
   consistency of a network of nonrecording raingauges based on the annual
   rainfall recorded by six representative stations in the Tacuarembo River
   basin in Uruguay. The identification of possible errors not revealed in
   the printed records was accomplished by application of the factor
   correspondence analysis method and verified with success by the
   classical double-mass analysis. This ability to identify suspicious data
   with very modest requirements for data management implies that the
   methodology based on factor correspondence analysis could find wide
   application.}},

Abstract = {{A summary of the results of regional flood frequency analyses that have
   been carried out in many tropical and sub-tropical countries is
   presented. The results provide a set of flood estimation methods which
   should be of immediate usefulness in practical applications, bearing in
   mind the errors of generalization. By defining the representative values
   of the mean annual flood and of the flood frequency curves for each
   region, an attempt has been made to develop relationships between the
   methods and climatic characteristics. These show that adequate
   relationships can be obtained based solely on the median annual average
   rainfall and the median catchment area for the regions. In particular,
   the steepness of the regional flood frequency curve can be estimated
   reasonably well from these two parameters. The relationships confirm
   that, broadly speaking, for humid regions the `'average'' flood - the
   flood that occurs regularly every one or two years - is relatively
   large, but the flood frequency curve is not very steep; rare floods
   (occurring once in every 100 to 1000 years) are not very much larger
   than the average flood. Conversely, in arid regions, the average flood
   is small, but rare floods can be extremely large multiples of the
   average. These relationships provide a useful initial indication of the
   type of regional flood frequency estimation method likely to be found in
   tropical and sub-tropical regions throughout the world.}},

Abstract = {{Aquifer remediation operations are often behind schedule. Usually, a
   rather sharp concentration decrease shortly after the start of an
   operation is followed by a situation in which hardly any concentration
   decrease is observed. Furthermore, the concentration increases after
   stopping the groundwater recovery. These phenomena are caused by
   so-called tailing. An important cause of tailing is the phenomenon that
   equilibrium is not reached for some of the transport and sorption
   processes involved. To predict these effects of tailing, IWACO has
   developed a program SORWACO, which describes the behaviour of solutes
   along a path line. Processes for which equilibrium is reached quickly as
   well as processes for which equilibrium is reached only slowly are taken
   into account. The program has been verified against breakthrough curves
   observed in column experiments reported in the literature. The program
   parameters were calibrated using the data of several experiments. The
   resulting set of parameter values accurately described the transport for
   different flow velocities. The fact that quite good results can be
   obtained without a lot of data from a specific site makes the program a
   valuable tool for the design of remediation operations. The program is
   especially useful when extensive input data are not available so that
   detailed three-dimensional or stochastic models cannot be applied. The
   use of the program is illustrated by means of a case study. The progress
   was monitored and the data show good correspondence with the predictions
   of the program.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and validation of a water balance
   model of the Upper Blue Nile in Ethiopia. A major requirement of any
   modelling attempt is the availability of climatic and hydrological data.
   However, for the Upper Blue Nile, only a limited number of observation
   sites are available over a very large area. As a result, the model
   described here is a grid-based water balance model which requires
   limited data inputs, few parameters and runs on a monthly time-step.
   Climate is dominated by the influence of elevation in the river basin.
   Estimates of potential evapotranspiration (PE) and rainfall are
   predicted for 10-minute resolution grid cells for input to the model.
   These estimates are based on multiple regression models using latitude,
   longitude and elevation. In the basin, annual mean PE and rainfall
   range, with increasing elevation, from 1800 mm to 1200 mm and 924 mm to
   1845 mm, respectively. In the model, vegetation cover is not explicitly
   treated and soil characteristics are spatially invariant. The model is
   calibrated to reproduce mean monthly runoff over a 37-year period
   (1953-1987), and validated by its ability to simulate sub-catchment
   runoff and historical variations in Blue Nile runoff. The key factor
   that determines model performance is the quality of the rainfall inputs,
   with the best results obtained with a time series comprised of long,
   good quality station data. Over a 76-year period the correlation between
   observed and simulated annual flows was 0.74 and the mean error was
   14\%, although fairly large errors occurred in individual years.
   Considering the paucity of data for the basin, these results are
   encouraging. The model is used to investigate spatial variability in the
   sensitivity of runoff to changes in rainfall and PE. The sensitivity is
   greatly affected by the runoff ratio of the model grid cells and it
   increases as grid cell runoff ratio decreases. The sensitivity is also
   affected by the seasonal distribution of rainfall. The paper ends with a
   discussion of the model's performance and its potential for future
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The threshold level approach is used to define drought characteristics,
   i.e. drought duration and deficit volume from time series of daily
   streamflow. Three different procedures for pooling dependent droughts
   are compared: a method based on an inter-event time and volume criterion
   (IC), a moving average procedure (MA), and a method based on the sequent
   peak algorithm (SPA). The extreme values of drought duration and deficit
   volume are analysed using both an annual maximum series (AMS) and a
   partial duration series (PDS) approach. Two Danish catchments with very
   different flow regimes were used in the study. The IC and MA methods
   provided virtually the same sample statistics of the AMS of drought
   duration and deficit volume for all thresholds considered. The results
   of the SPA method differed significantly from the other two methods for
   high thresholds due to the presence of multi-year droughts. For analysis
   of seasonal droughts the SPA method is restricted to low thresholds. The
   occurrence of a large number of zero-drought years for low thresholds
   may significantly reduce the information content of the AMS, and in this
   case the PDS model is superior. The problem of minor droughts in the PDS
   was implicitly reduced by using the MA and SPA methods, and in this
   respect these methods have an important advantage as compared to the IC
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Following the results of a study carried out for the neighbouring
   Sicilian region, this paper reports a study of the applicability of the
   annual value, F-aj, of the Arnouldus index to represent the erosion risk
   in Calabrian region. Firstly, by using 214 values of the mean annual
   value of the erosivity index, F-F, and a Kriging interpolation method,
   an isoerosivity map is plotted. Then, in order to predict the erosion
   risk for an event of any return period, the probability distribution of
   the F-aj index is studied. An in situ statistical analysis, carried out
   by using candidate distributions with two parameters (Gauss, LN2, EV1
   and Weibull distribution), showed that the EV1 and LN2 laws were
   characterized by the best fit to the empirical Cumulative Distribution
   Function (CDF) In order to establish the theoretical CDF to use as a
   regional parent distribution, the descriptive ability of the LN2 and EV1
   distributions was also studied by a hierarchical regional procedure.
   Finally, the analysis showed that for each Calabrian sub-region,
   characterized by a constant value of the coefficient of variation, the
   erosion risk index was constant.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model developed to simulate stable and unstable flows in
   unsaturated porous media is described. Results of numerical studies
   carried out to simulate laboratory experiments with the assumption of
   stable flow demonstrate the occurrence of unstable flow for the initial
   conditions of both air dry and field capacity for unsaturated
   infiltration in sands. This indicates that the Richards flow equation
   based on moisture content and potential variables averaged over total
   cross-sectional area may not be applicable for flow under
   instability-prone boundary conditions. The unstable flow due to wetting
   front instability is modelled using the steady-state theory proposed by
   Hillel \& Baker (1988). Simulation results for fingered flux calculated
   with the theory represent the experimental data reasonably well. The
   pore water velocity remains constant irrespective of the incident flux
   as long as the flux is smaller than the hydraulic conductivity value at
   the water entry suction of the porous media. The effect of antecedent
   wetness on the unstable flow behaviour is to reduce the pore water
   velocity drastically from air dry to field capacity conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Alluvial aquifers can often supply large quantities of water but if they
   are overlain by a low permeability zone, the recharge may be restricted
   with the result that the long term safe yield of the aquifer is greatly
   reduced. This paper describes a study of an alluvial aquifer in
   Bangladesh where there is a low permeability layer overlying the main
   aquifer. Pumping tests carried out in this aquifer were analysed using a
   numerical model which represents both the main aquifer and the overlying
   low permeability zone, Using the aquifer parameters deduced from the
   pumping test analysis, the numerical model was then used to represent
   five years of pumping. This long term simulation indicated that there
   would be a serious decline in the pumped levels and that a water table
   would develop in the main aquifer and would fall at a rate of almost
   five metres per year.}},

Abstract = {{Brackish karst springs are common along every karstic sea shore
   consisting of limestone and dolomite. On the Croatian sea coast there
   are more than 300 permanent or temporary brackish karst springs. From
   the standpoint of water supply, the problem of karst spring water
   salinization is quite significant because large quantities of high
   quality fresh water are not available to be used either as drinking
   water or for industrial and agricultural purposes. The salinity of
   brackish karst springs situated along the Adriatic coast varies from 10
   to more than 18 000 mg Cl 1(-1) with an unfavourable distribution during
   the year. In the wet winter period, when water quantities in the region
   are abundant, the salinity is exceedingly low. In the warm and dry
   summer period the chloride concentration is high. At that season, when a
   shortage of flesh water in the region occurs, especially due to tourism,
   karst spring water is so salty that it cannot be used at all. The
   mechanism of sea water intrusion is relatively well known but the
   problem of karst springs desalinization has not been solved in practice.
   The Ghyben-Herzberg relationship is formulated exclusively on the basis
   of hydrostatic equilibrium, and its use under dynamic conditions is
   limited. The dynamics of fresh water circulation towards karst spring
   exits are very specific for each individual spring. Using numerous
   hydrological, hydrometric, hydrogeological and speleological
   investigations of the brackish Blaz (Croatia) karst spring, this paper
   gives the plausible position and dimensions of the main karst conduits
   through which sea water penetrates into the spring exit.}},

   well during a dry season. Satisfactory agreement could only be obtained
   when account was taken of the withdrawal of water from below the water

Abstract = {{A study on the suspended sediment transportation downstream from the
   Danjiangkou Reservoir in China has shown that the dynamics of suspended
   sediment grain size are complicated. During the period when the
   reservoir was used for flood retention, the suspended sediment median
   size decreased gradually; after entering the period when the reservoir
   was used for water storage, the median size started to increase,
   reaching a maximum, and then decreased again. These variations
   correspond to different stages of channel adjustment. At the stage with
   dominant downcutting, most of the downstream reservoir sediment comes
   from bed downcutting, and thus the suspended sediment median size
   becomes coarser and coarser; at the succeeding stage with dominant
   channel widening, a majority of the suspended sediment comes from bank
   erosion, and so its median size becomes finer. This phenomenon can be
   regarded as a reflection of the complex response of channel adjustment
   in the characteristics of suspended sediment transportation downstream
   from a reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{An algorithm is described that was initially developed as a simple
   method for patching and extending observed time series of daily
   streamflow. It is based on the use of I-day flow duration curves for
   each month of the year and on the assumption that flows occurring
   simultaneously at sites in reasonably close proximity to each other
   correspond to similar percentage points on their respective duration
   curves. The algorithm has been incorporated into a model that allows
   flows at a destination site to be estimated from flows occurring at
   several source sites. The model has been applied to six groups of
   catchments within southern Africa and the resulting streamflow
   simulations compare favourably with those obtained using a
   semi-distributed, physically-based, daily time step rainfall-runoff
   model. The current limitations of the approach and its future potential
   value are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Winter mean 700-hectoPascal (hPa) height anomalies, representing the
   average atmospheric circulation during the snow season, are compared
   with annual streamflow measured at 140 streamgauges in the western
   United States. Correlation and anomaly pattern analyses are used to
   identify relationships between winter mean atmospheric circulation and
   temporal and spatial variability in annual streamflow. Results indicate
   that variability in winter mean 700-Hpa height anomalies accounts for a
   statistically significant portion of the temporal variability in annual
   streamflow in the western United States. In general, above-average
   annual streamflow is associated with negative winter mean 700-Hpa height
   anomalies over the eastern North Pacific Ocean and/or the western United
   States. The anomalies produce an anomalous flow of moist air from the
   eastern North Pacific Ocean into the western United States that
   increases winter precipitation and snowpack accumulations, and
   subsequently streamflow. Winter mean 700-hPa height anomalies also
   account for statistically significant differences in spatial
   distributions of annual streamflow. As part of this study, winter mean
   atmospheric circulation patterns for the 40 years analysed were
   classified into five winter mean 700-hPa height anomaly patterns. These
   patterns are related to statistically significant and physically
   meaningful differences in spatial distributions of annual streamflow.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the inclusion of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere

   simulates the daily evolution of soil moisture in two layers: the
   surface layer representing the first ten centimetres of the soil and the
   bulk layer representing the root zone. The results of the model
   calibration on a test site, and the results of the model validation on
   36 watersheds, show its good capability to simulate streamflows and soil
   moisture in the surface layer and in the hulk soil layer. These first
   results are very encouraging and open the possibility of using these

Abstract = {{Global climate change can be reproduced in detail by using
   three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs). However, such
   complex models require super-computers and extensive hours of
   computational time for a single attempt at reproducing long term climate
   change. An alternative approach is to make simplifying assumptions that
   retain the essential physics for the desired simulation. Energy balance
   and radiative-convective models are examples of such models. The model
   in this study follows the simplified approach using physics-based
   climate processes as well as interactions between atmospheric and
   hydrological processes. The vertically and latitudinally averaged mean
   temperature and mean water vapour content between 30 degrees N-50
   degrees N latitudes are considered as atmospheric state variables while
   soil and sea temperatures and water storage amount are considered for
   describing the behaviour of the hydrological system. Temperatures in
   both the atmosphere and ground are calculated by a thermal energy
   equation that considers the physically-based processes of shortwave
   radiation, longwave radiation, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux.
   precipitation and evaporation processes transport moisture between the
   atmosphere and ground. In this study, the radiation parameterization of
   the simplified climate model is tested in the investigation of the
   various effects of global warming due to doubling and quadrupling of
   CO2. Changes of temperature, soil water content, evaporation rate and
   precipitation rate are investigated by numerical experiments. The
   simplified climate model provides acceptable simulation of climate
   change and holds promise for practical investigations such as the
   interactions of physical processes in the evolution of drought
   phenomena.}},

Abstract = {{Both the conventional and the Carlson trophic state index (TSI)
   classification methods were employed to assess the eutrophication state
   of 26 lakes in the Norfolk Broads, UK. The parameters employed were:
   Secchi depth, chlorophyll a and total phosphorous which had been
   obtained previously by using Landsat TM imagery, ground reference data
   and empirical algorithms for the Norfolk Broads (Baban, 1993). The
   conventional method did not provide sufficient differentiation between
   the Broads. The Carlson TSI provided sufficient information to
   differentiate between all 26 Broads. Consequently, using the Carlson TSI
   information, these Broads were classified into three groups. The
   classification was based on the relationship between the calculated
   Carlson TSI of the external phosphorous loading and its influence on the
   eutrophication process as deduced from the calculated TSI values for the
   other two parameters. The results were consistent with all the available
   knowledge and experience concerning these Broads and demonstrated the
   potential of combining remote sensing techniques and Carlson TSI in
   eutrophication assessment, ecosystem checking and watershed analysis.}},

   set of statistical methods for the detection of breaks in the time

   characteristic discharges. From a quantitative standpoint, the existence
   of a clear break in the series of annual mean discharges at the
   beginning of the decade from 1970, the date from which the runoffs
   decrease significantly, was noted. A more qualitative study of the
   results showed that low flows were more affected than high flows by this
   variability of the regime. This fluctuation appears to be in accord with
   the drought phenomena observed during the same period in the Sahel, to
   the north of Ivory Coast.}},

Abstract = {{The Chezy friction formula for steady flow in a uniform symmetrical
   channel with constant slope-friction factor is examined mathematically.
   Firstly, a wide rectangular channel and a semi-circular channel are
   compared in respect of the mean flow velocity using the Chezy formula
   with the Manning, Chezy and logarithmic laws for velocity. Then the
   inverse Chezy problem, i.e. the determination of the channel shape above
   the reference level for a given depth/discharge rating curve, is posed
   and the differential-integral equation for its solution is derived. The
   rating curves used for computation are the results of multiplying the
   discharge for a trapezoidal shape above the reference level by an
   exponential function. To facilitate interpretation of the numerical
   results, the relationship between side slope and discharge is analysed.
   It is shown by the inverse problem solution that an exponential
   reduction of channel flow capacity changes linear channel sides into
   convex sides (making the cross section shape wider) while an exponential
   increase of capacity causes changes into concave sides (reducing a
   section width) which is against common sense.}},

   of slope to mean velocity above a reference level is posed and then

   widening with depth, while the other has an upper bound and yields a

Abstract = {{The Sag aquifer is a Cambro-Ordovician Sandstone Formation that extends
   over 1200 km in Saudi Arabia and northwards in Jordan. It is an enormous

   the Sag aquifer groundwater. This includes a description of the chemical
   composition of the groundwater, the spatial variation of its salinity
   and the processes that control this variability. A total of 384 wells
   drilled in the Sag aquifer were sampled and water analyses performed for
   the major ionic composition. The data were analysed using software
   computer programs. Saturation indices were calculated, ionic
   relationships were studied, hydrochemical facies were determined and
   water types were identified. The principal processes that control the
   groundwater quality variations are also discussed. The results of this
   study provide information needed for groundwater quality management in

Abstract = {{This paper examines methodologies for the simulation of storms for the
   purpose of design flood generation in the Thames region. Existing
   methods are reviewed and two new approaches are proposed. One combines
   point profiles of storms extracted from long rainfall records with
   depth-duration-frequency statistics. The other uses a stochastic
   rainfall model based upon the Poisson point process to generate data.
   Rainfall events simulated by these two methods are compared and the
   flood statistics obtained by inputting these events into a
   rainfall-runoff model are examined for a small catchment in Surrey,
   England. The Poisson based model is recommended as the more reliable.}},

Abstract = {{Saturated excess overland flow has been recognized to be the major
   process responsible for rapid flow in temperate areas with good
   vegetation cover. However, the problem of the location of the saturated
   surfaces remains a field of research. Actual topography is assumed to be
   the main factor yet in some conditions, paleotopography seems to be more
   determining. This situation is observed near Sao Paulo (Brazil) in
   relation to the erosive crisis preceding the actual sedimentation phase.
   On the other hand, studies show that saturated areas are not always
   contributing areas when they are not directly connected with the main
   stream. In order to make progress with hydrological models, it is
   suggested that, prior to modelling, hydrological watershed patterns need
   to be known.}},

   results of the recharge, the dependencies between it and the rainfall

Abstract = {{The sensitivities of groundwater-streamflow interaction to global
   climate change over the medium-sized mountainous Mesochora catchment in
   central Greece have been analysed. The global climate change was
   simulated through a set of hypothetical and monthly GISS (Goddard
   Institute for Space Studies) scenarios of temperature increases coupled
   with precipitation changes. The catchment hydrological regime, which is
   dominated by spring snowmelt runoff, was simulated by the coupling of
   the snowmelt and soil moisture accounting models of the US National
   Weather Service River Forecast System (US NWSRFS). The groundwater was
   represented through a lower zone one-tension water storage and two free
   water storages parameterized by the soil moisture model, while the
   streamflow was the sum of direct runoff, surface runoff and interflow
   from the upper zone free water, plus the primary and secondary baseflows
   yielded by the model. The interaction between groundwater and streamflow
   was expressed by the ratio of the two variables on a seasonal and
   monthly basis. Both representations of global climate change resulted in
   a moderate influence on the groundwater-streamflow interaction during
   the winter months and in a very high one in the spring and summer
   months. In particular, the major seasonal shift in the snow accumulation
   pattern related to climate change, as well as the large runoff reduction
   and evapotranspiration increase occurring in spring and summer months,
   boosted considerably the groundwater to streamflow ratio. This latter
   would probably have negative impacts on various problems of water
   resources management (e.g. droughts, water supply, irrigation, water
   pollution).}},

Abstract = {{The availability of satellite-derived rainfall products to hydrologists
   and other natural scientists has increased enormously in the last five
   years. The purpose of this paper is to review concisely the current
   state-of-the-art of satellite precipitation estimation over land and the
   availability of standard products, and to highlight some of the
   strengths and limitations of satellite-derived rainfall data for
   hydrological applications. Methods based on infrared, visible and
   passive microwave radiation measurements are discussed. Results of
   several international activities aimed at evaluating the performance of
   the estimation algorithms are briefly summarized.}},

Abstract = {{Since no remote sensing (RS) devices have been developed allowing the
   measurement of river runoff directly, information from RS sources is
   used to compute runoff values indirectly. This is done with the aid of
   hydrological models, where RS data are used in two different ways: (1)
   in the form of model input data; and (2) for model parameter estimation.
   Three types of models are discussed, the parameters of which are
   estimated - at least partially - with the aid of RS information. A
   mathematical model is demonstrated, which reconstructs monthly river
   runoff volumes on the basis of IR data obtained by the Meteosat
   geostationary satellite. The second model computes flood hydrographs
   with the aid of a distributed system rainfall/runoff model. A major
   model parameter, viz. the soil water storage capacity, which varies in
   space, is determined on the basis of Landsat imagery and digital soil
   maps. The third model discussed is a water balance model which computes
   all relevant variables of the water balance equation including runoff on
   a daily basis. Parameters used in the model components for interception,
   evapotranspiration and soil storage are estimated with the aid of RS
   information originating from Landsat and NOAA data. Examples of the
   performance of all three models are presented. Input to hydrological
   models computing runoff is usually either rainfall or snowmelt or both.
   An example for model input estimation on the basis of satellite data is
   presented as well as the use of ground-based weather radar rainfall
   measurements for real time flood forecasting. An example of snowmelt
   runoff modelling is mentioned, followed by a brief discussion of future
   perspectives of runoff computations with the aid of RS data.}},

Abstract = {{Certain satellite-based remote sensing for snow hydrology applications
   has been very positive, namely, snow areal extent mapping using visible
   and near-infrared sensors and snow water equivalent using passive
   microwave techniques. Although certain problems are yet to be solved,
   very specific applications have become operational. Data from the
   NOAA-AVHRR sensor are used to produce snow extent maps for about 4000
   basins in North America and the data are distributed electronically by
   the NWS National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center. At the
   Canadian Climate Centre, a method has been developed for real time
   estimation of areal snow water equivalent over the Canadian prairies
   using microwave brightness temperatures, and the snow water equivalent
   maps are distributed to operational hydrological forecasters. Current
   research may also prove fruitful for estimates of snow wetness or active
   melting, snow albedo and snow grain size. It appears that forthcoming
   improvements in passive microwave spatial resolution should increase the
   applicability of the data for snow hydrology. The spectral and spatial
   resolution of the visible/near-infrared data will also be improved with
   the launch of EOS/MODIS. Combinations of sensors and integration with
   other types of data will further improve the suitability of spaceborne
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring evapotranspiration (ET) at large scales is important for
   assessing climate and anthropogenic effects on natural and agricultural
   ecosystems. This paper describes techniques used in evaluating ET with
   remote sensing, which is the only technology that can efficiently and
   economically provide regional and global coverage. Some of the
   empirical/statistical techniques have been used operationally with
   satellite data for computing daily ET at regional scales. The more
   complex numerical simulation models require detailed input parameters
   that may limit their application to regions containing a large database
   of soils and vegetation properties. Current efforts are being directed
   towards simplifying the parameter requirements of these models.
   Essentially all energy balance models rely on an estimate of the
   available energy (net radiation less soil heat flux). Net radiation is
   not easily determined from space, although progress is being made.
   Simplified approaches for estimating soil heat flux appear promising for
   operational applications. In addition, most ET models utilize remote
   sensing data in the shortwave and thermal wavelengths to measure key
   boundary conditions. Differences between the radiometric surface
   temperature and aerodynamic temperature can be significant and progress
   in incorporating this effect is evident. Atmospheric effects on optical
   data are significant, and optical sensors cannot see through clouds.
   This has led some to use microwave observations as a surrogate for
   optical data to provide estimates of surface moisture and surface
   temperature; preliminary results are encouraging. The approaches that
   appear most promising use surface temperature and vegetation indices or
   a time rate of change in surface temperature coupled to an atmospheric
   boundary layer model. For many of these models, differences with ET
   observations can be as low as 20\% from hourly to daily time scales,
   approaching the level of uncertainty in the measurement of ET and
   contradicting some recent pessimistic conclusions concerning the utility
   of remotely sensed radiometric surface temperature for determining the
   surface energy balance.}},

Abstract = {{Passive and active microwave remote sensing instruments are capable of
   measuring the surface soil moisture (0-5 cm) and can be implemented on
   high altitude platforms, e.g. spacecraft, for repetitive large area
   observations. The amount of water present in a soil affects its
   dielectric properties. The dielectric properties, along with several
   other physical characteristics, determine the microwave measurement. In
   addition, the significance of the dielectric properties depends upon the
   sensor design, especially the wavelength. Instruments operating at
   longer wavelengths (>5 cm) have fewer problems with the atmosphere and
   vegetation, sense a deeper soil layer and maximize soil moisture
   sensitivity. Another instrument concern is whether to use an active or
   passive microwave approach. Active approaches, especially synthetic
   aperture radar, can provide extremely good ground resolution from space
   (<100 m). Passive methods currently provide much coarser resolution data
   (>10 km). The existing data interpretation algorithms for passive data
   are well tested for bare soil and vegetation and can be applied to a
   wide range of conditions. At the present time, the active microwave
   algorithms have not been widely verified. There has been a significant
   amount of recent research using both active and passive methods as a
   result of the availability of new sensor systems. With these new
   instruments have also come greater efforts to integrate the observations
   in large scale multidisciplinary investigations. A greater emphasis on
   the spatial distribution and temporal behaviour of soil moisture has
   produced some very interesting and valuable data sets that demonstrate
   the potential of a dedicated observing system for scientific and
   operational studies.}},

Abstract = {{The application of high spectral and spatial resolution airborne remote
   sensing has developed to an almost operational level. This paper
   investigates the role of remote sensing especially coupled to the two
   other available water quality assessment tools: in situ measurements and
   eco logical water quality modelling data. A case study is presented for
   three shallow lakes varying in trophic level. Based upon a similarity
   index it is demonstrated that remote sensing provides valuable
   additional information for chlorophyll-a, seston dry weight and Secchi
   depth measurements, as compared to the two other water quality
   assessment tools.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional use of remotely sensed image interpretation lies in the
   qualitative characterization of hydrogeological mapping units and the
   detection of specific features. Most applications pertain to crystalline
   basements, limestones and Quaternary volcanic terrain. More recent
   developments pertain to groundwater emergence in the discharge areas of
   groundwater flow systems, using thermal and multispectral imagery, and
   to the management of groundwater. For the latter, spatial recharge
   patterns and contamination assessment will focus attention on defining
   the parameters of vegetation and terrain mapping units and on monitoring
   hydrogeologically relevant surface features embedded in spatial
   groundwater models.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that remotely sensed data should provide
   major benefits to hydrology and water resources and yet there are few
   case studies that show practical benefits. One of the reasons for this
   is the lack of tools to convert remotely sensed data to the type of
   information useful to water resource systems operators. Hydrological
   models can play an important role in this translation of data to
   information. This paper reviews some of the techniques presently used in
   hydrological models to make use of remotely sensed data and provides a
   comprehensive reference list.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are very useful for hydrological
   studies because the dielectric properties of materials are generally
   dependent on the amount of liquid water in the material, and this
   affects the strength of the radar backscatter, sigma degrees.
   Additionally, the ability of microwaves to penetrate the surface of many
   materials often permits analysis of subsurface properties. Further, SAR
   sensors can image the Earth through both clouds and darkness which
   enables dynamic hydrological events, e.g. floods, to be captured. Both
   radar system parameters and surface characteristics affect sigma
   degrees. In the case of snow, sigma degrees is the sum of the surface
   scattering at the air/snow interface, volume scattering within the
   snowpack, scattering at the snow/soil interface and volumetric
   scattering from the underlying surface (if applicable). For glaciers,
   sigma degrees is dominated by scattering from the surface and is
   dependent upon the roughness of the glacier surface in relationship to
   the radar wavelength. Imaging radar is proving to be an important tool
   for measuring flooding beneath a variety of herbaceous and woody
   vegetation. Use of multi-frequency and multi-polarization sensors is
   necessary to improve the accuracy of mapping flooded vs non-flooded land
   in floodplains. SAR data have been shown to have potential for measuring
   stream discharge in braided rivers and for studying key characteristics
   of frozen lakes. Work with polarimetric SAR data is becoming
   increasingly significant in hydrological studies.}},

Abstract = {{Shortly after the development of the first laser instrument in 1960,
   studies began on using laser distancing technology from airborne
   platforms to measure surface features on the landscape. Airborne laser
   altimeter studies in the 1960s and 1970s were used to measure terrain
   features and sea ice roughness. Research in the 1980s and 1990s has
   shown that airborne laser measurements can be used to measure directly
   topography, stream channel cross sections, gully cross sections, soil
   surface roughness, and vegetation canopy height, cover and distribution.
   These laser measurements can be used to estimate forest biomass and
   volume, aerodynamic roughness and leaf area indices. Airborne laser
   altimeters provide quick and accurate measurements for evaluating
   changes in land surface features and can be an additional tool in the
   arsenal of remote sensing equipment used to understand watershed
   properties and to develop plans to manage water resources.}},

Abstract = {{A few aspects of spatial variability, connected with climate
   variability, in the Rio de la Plata basin are analysed through changes
   in the basin runoff considered as indicative of the annual integrated
   precipitation. Those changes contain better information on climate
   variability than the sparse records of precipitation and temperature in
   view of the high spatial and temporal variability of those parameters.
   The precipitation data are applied in the most active zones of the
   basin, however, in order to assess aspects of hydrological variability
   that the lack of data causes in the studied region. The hydrological
   series employed correspond to average monthly and yearly flows at
   stations selected along the main rivers, both due to stability in their
   gauging stations and to the availability and quality of data for the
   1931-1992 period. This period includes the longest series of
   simultaneous observations for the stations selected. Similar approaches
   were applied to the series of precipitation. Through basic statistical
   analysis, and from the annual evolution of flows and precipitation, the
   study of the relationship between rainfalls in the area and flows at
   separate hydrological stations (taking also the annual cycle of
   precipitation and flows into account), nine hydrological areas were
   detected. From those areas, well separated from each other, the spatial
   variability for the Rio de la Plata basin was characterized.}},

Abstract = {{Information on the snowmelt factor (SMF) is required for the estimation
   of snow and glacier melt runoff. In the present study, SMF is computed
   for a normal snowpack over a glacier at an altitude of about 4000 m in
   the Garhwal Himalayas. The effect of natural dusting on SMF is also
   examined. For this purpose, natural dust available at the site of the
   experiment was uniformly spread over the snow surface to form a 2 mm
   thick layer. The melt runoff from the snow blocks and air temperature at
   2 m above the snow surface were observed. Mean daily SMF values for
   normal and dusted snow blocks were computed to be 5.94 and 6.62 mm
   degrees C-1 day(-1), respectively. Mean daily SMF for the dusted snow
   block was found to be always higher than that of the dust free snow
   block. Maximum hourly values of SMF for the normal and dusted snow
   blocks were obtained in the range of 0.583-0.632 and 0.785-0.824 mm
   degrees C-1 h(-1), respectively, while the minimum value was zero for
   all cases. Maximum hourly value of SMF occurred at about 1400 h for both
   blocks. A comparison of the daily SMF with information already available
   in the literature is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Incorporating the variance in forecast flow at various lead times was
   attempted in this study taking into account the uncertainty in models.
   The probability of exceeding a specific discharge was therefore
   estimated to provide further information for flood warning. The model
   for forecasting flow was composed of an autoregressive model for
   upstream flow forecasting and a Muskingum-type model for channel
   routing. The uncertainties in both models were represented by the
   variance of input parameters and previous forecast values. Both Mean
   Value First-Order Second Moment and Monte Carlo methods were adopted to
   estimate a reliability index and the probability of exceedence of a
   specific discharge at various lead times. Both methods yielded similar
   results. From the stochastic viewpoint, the model for flow forecasting
   had reasonable forecasting ability around the peak flow based on the
   verification from five historical storm events.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variability of both long and short term rainfall in an urban
   environment in Malaysia was studied using historical monthly and yearly
   rainfall data and, unique for the humid tropics region, recently
   collected, short term rainfall data measured with very small time and
   space resolution. The results for the yearly data indicated some
   elongation of the spatial structures of rainfall in the area. The
   monthly rainfall data showed that the geographical orientation of these
   structures for the months of December to March was different from that
   during April to November. These differences were due to the effects
   caused by monsoon seasonality and by the influence of the sea. The
   spatial structure and depth-area relationship for short term
   thunderstorms have been derived. The basic statistics of point
   observations were also studied. The results showed that the spatial
   variability of short term rainfall was more significant for short term
   rainfall than for the long term behaviour. Thus, the spatial structure
   of short term rainfall should be considered as important in urban runoff
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall simulation experiments on road batters in a forest catchment in
   New South Wales, Australia, demonstrated the limits of small scale
   erosion studies. Comparable erodibility studies were carried out on road
   surfaces, road batters constructed of soil, bedrock and unconsolidated
   materials and the forest surfaces. There was no significant difference
   in sediment loss between any type of site, nor was there any significant
   relationship between sediment loss and either slope, materials or
   vegetation cover. The difficulties in obtaining any relationships
   between sediment loss, slope, cover and material type have implications
   for the usefulness of models which attempt to predict soil losses, as
   well as for future experimental work of this type.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical analysis of mean monthly rainfall measured by 31 gauges in
   the Freetown Peninsula shows clear differences between those facing the
   south-westerly monsoon and those in the peninsular rain-shadow. Whilst
   catches between ocean-facing and rain-shadow gauges were very similar in
   the drier months of December to May, catches by ocean-facing gauges were
   considerably greater in the wetter months of June to October, and their
   catches varied less spatially. Rainfall in the monsoon months increased
   with altitude, but the relationships between monthly rainfall and
   altitude were more marked for rain-shadow gauges than for ocean-facing
   gauges. Rainfall in the monsoon months also tended to decrease with
   distance from the sea, and whilst the decreases were similar in
   magnitude for both rain-shadow and ocean-facing gauges, the decreases
   per km distance were less variable in the rain-shadow than where gauges
   faced the ocean. Two gauges, one in rain-shadow and one ocean-facing,
   were found to catch less than expected; and two gauges in the
   ocean-facing group were found to be particularly influential in
   determining the regression fit.}},

Abstract = {{On the northern slopes of the Urbion and Neila Ridges there is a karstic
   system of Jurassic limestones and dolomites in a monoclinal arrangement,
   bounded above and below, respectively, by the impermeable series of the
   Keuper and Weald. Recharge is by infiltration of rain and melting snow
   as well as from the outflow of numerous streams. Discharge flows towards
   the springs of the young Rivers Najerilla (198 1 s(-1)) and Arlanza (500
   1 s(-1)). An interesting point is an underground transfer at Urbion of
   14 hm(3) year(-1) from the basin of the Ebro to that of the Duero.
   According to water-tracing tests, the average steady-state flow speed in
   the aquifers is between 27 and 38 m h(-1), and 160 m h(-1) near the
   outlet. A simulation in 1990-1991 of the hydrographs of the springs
   using a rainfall-runoff model provided a detailed hydrological balance
   in which the importance of upstream turbulent flow was evident. The net
   recharge of precipitation was 42-43\%, though this varied considerably
   with the seasons.}},

   factors to both training and verification sequences has underlined the
   importance of such factors to network performance. Trials with both one

   performances are achieved with the extra hidden layer, the additional

Abstract = {{Remote sensing (RS) applications have become an important tool for the
   rapid evaluation of water resources. This paper deals with the
   utilization of RS data as the main input in an integrated approach for
   groundwater targeting. The Mulug Taluk, with an areal extent of 3200
   km(2), is one of the poor taluks in the Warangal District, Andhra
   Pradesh, India. A hydrogeomorphological study based on remote sensing
   (Landsat 5, TM) helped in establishing: (i) a broad demarcation of
   different lithological units viz., old Pakhals, Vindhyans, Gondwanas and
   recent alluvium; (ii) erosional landforms (96\%) viz., denudational
   hills, structural hills, mesa/buttes, linear ridges, a pediment
   inselberg complex, a shallow weathered pediplain, a moderately weathered
   pediplain and depositional landforms (4\%) such as flood plain areas;
   and (iii) delineation of minor and major lineaments. The investigations
   revealed that the potential for groundwater development is in the
   preferential order of alluvium, Gondwanas and Puranas. A statistical
   treatment of the data also confirmed that wells on lineaments yield more
   than wells away from lineaments. NE-SW structural trends cutting across
   the regional trend appeared to be more favourable for the exploitation
   of baseflow for shallow groundwater development.}},

Abstract = {{The hysteresis (eta) of the non-dimensional site-specific rating curve
   is used to describe the occurrence of a kinematic wave (KW), a diffusion
   wave (DW) or a dynamic wave (DYW) in the downstream valleys of the Teton
   dam, USA, and the Machhu dam II, India. Criteria are developed for the
   occurrence of these waves. The study reveals that the hysteresis is the
   energy loss occurring at a particular site and is related to the speed
   of travel, wave number, phase difference and attenuation characteristics
   of the flood wave. The role of eta is shown to be of vital importance
   in: (i) choosing a suitable downstream boundary for improving the
   results; and (ii) identifying the wave zones where approximate models
   can substitute the complete DYW model.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial properties of field soils vary in a complex manner. Especially
   in arid and semiarid areas, this variability affects plant quality and
   crop production. An experimental field plot was extensively sampled
   regarding soil water (378 gravimetrical samples), soil chemical content
   (314 samples), and crop yield and chemical content (26 samples) at the
   Cherfech agricultural field research station in Tunisia. Geostatistical
   analyses were made to gain a better understanding of the in situ
   variability of soil water, soil chemical and crop properties. Ranges of
   correlation were found to vary over distances between 5 and over 40 m.
   Nugget and sill values for semivariograms were almost an order of
   magnitude larger for crop samples compared to soil samples, The crop
   yield components appeared to have larger variability as compared to crop
   chemical components}},

Abstract = {{River flow results from the interplay of numerous variables for which
   quantitative information is not easily available. The aim of this paper
   was to develop a river-flow forecasting model based only on rainfall and
   runoff information. The proposed model has been implemented with the
   combined utilization of two methods: a neural network method, which
   takes into account the non-linearity of the rainfall-runoff relationship
   and an adaptative technique, the Kalman filter, allowing real time
   correction of estimates. The rainfall-runoff relationship has been
   modelled on two rivers in northern France. The weekly and daily time
   step models gave satisfying forecasts, even for different lead times.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the kinematic wave equations, formulae for the wave celerity
   along an overland plane subject to uniform rainfall excess and with a
   constant upstream inflow together with the corresponding average wave
   celerity and time to equilibrium for the entire plane are derived. The
   formulae are further developed in terms of both the Darcy-Weisbach
   resistance coefficient and the Manning resistance coefficient. By
   comparing the wave celerities, the average wave celerities and the time
   to equilibrium for planes with and without upstream inflow show that the
   upstream inflow causes the wave celerity and the average wave celerity
   to be faster and the times to equilibrium to be shorter. The effect of
   upstream inflow is greater with increasing inflow, but the marginal
   effect decreases with increasing inflow. The effect is greatest for
   laminar flow and least for turbulent flow. For the wave celerity, the
   effect is also greatest at the upstream end of the plane and least at
   the downstream end of the plane.}},

Abstract = {{Land cover classification in Kitami, which covers an area of 12 km x 9.6

   zone percentages for urban and residential areas were estimated using
   the normalized vegetation index obtained with Landsat TM data. The
   monthly mean areal evapotranspiration for Kitami was obtained by
   Kojima's (1979) equation in winter and by Morton's (1978) equation in
   other seasons. The annual variation in estimated monthly mean
   evapotranspiration, which reaches its maximum value in July, correlated
   reasonably well with the evapotranspiration in an observation field. The

Abstract = {{Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe
   metamorphosed snow crystals and grains obtained in the field.
   Metamorphosed snow was obtained from seasonal snowpacks in the Colorado
   Rocky Mountains and in Alaska. The snow samples obtained in snowpits
   were mounted on modified SEM stubs, frozen in liquid nitrogen,
   transported in Dewar flasks to the SEM facility, sputter coated with
   platinum, and imaged with an electron beam. Analysis of a representative
   set of snow samples revealed examples of metamorphosed stellar crystals,
   fine snow grains with sintering, rounded and faceted crystals, several
   types of depth hear, rounded grains of melt metamorphism, and an ice
   lens. Some of the crystals exhibiting both rounding and facets indicated
   that both equitemperature and temperature gradient metamorphism
   influenced the snowpack. The SEM methods developed are operable in the
   field and can be used to quantify three-dimensionally size, shape and
   bonding characteristics of crystals. SEM appears to have direct
   application for better understanding of snow crystal metamorphism and
   snowpack processes, increasing knowledge of conditions leading to
   avalanche formation, and improving modelling of the transfer of
   microwave energy from the ground surface through the snowpack for
   eventual estimation of snow water equivalent.}},

Abstract = {{A river regime describes the average seasonal behaviour of flow. This
   seasonal pattern reflects climatic and physiographic conditions in the
   basin. An inherent characteristic of a flow regime is its stability,
   i.e. regularity or irregularity of the seasonal pattern. A temperature
   rise, as predicted by climatic models, might cause changes in the
   patterns and stability of river flow regimes. Sensitivity of the
   stability of flow regimes to small fluctuations in temperature
   (approximate to +/- 1 degrees C) is investigated with the help of
   historical temperature and flow series for Scandinavia. The concept of
   entropy is utilized for quantification of the stability of the flow
   regimes conditioned on temperature which also allows forecasting of
   possible changes in this stability due to changes in temperature. The
   study shows that the stability of now regime types with rain or mixed
   rain and snowmelt sources of flow formation is already sensitive to
   small changes in temperature, especially concerning flow minima.}},

Abstract = {{This study proposes a method for the estimation of lag time of forested
   mountainous watersheds. Hydrological flood-flow design methods require a
   time parameter, such as lag time or time of concentration, to estimate
   peak discharge and the flood hydrograph shape. Most existing methods
   used to compute the time parameter of a watershed are empirical and have
   been developed for urban or rural watersheds. Use of these methods for
   forested mountainous watersheds may result in severe underestimation of
   watershed response time and consequently, in overestimation of peak
   flood discharge. The water flow in a watershed is separated and analysed
   in two phases, viz. the land or hillslope phase and the stream channel
   phase. Most of the flow in a forested steep watershed is generated
   through subsurface pathways, and this knowledge, acquired from field
   experiments, is combined with kinematic wave equations to describe the
   generation of flow from steep forested hillslopes. This hillslope runoff
   is then used as input to the stream channels. Kinematic wave equations
   are developed for the runoff movement in the channels by assuming that
   both the roughness coefficient and the stream channel slope vary with
   the distance from the outlet of the watershed. These assumptions are
   validated and confirmed with data from the USA and Coastal British
   Columbia, Canada. The resulting equations are integrated to obtain an
   equation for the lag time. Comparison of the results of the proposed
   equation with data from two experimental watersheds in Coastal British
   Columbia and empirical equations used for the calculation of the lag
   time indicates that the proposed method is reliable and gives a good
   approximation of the observed lag time. These results are compared with
   other empirical equation, and it is shown that these earlier methods can
   result in severe underestimation of lag time.}},

Abstract = {{Wang (1991) reported that a genetic algorithm (GA), combined with a
   local search method, is an efficient and robust means for the
   calibration of conceptual rainfall-runoff models. In this article Wang's
   genetic algorithm has been slightly modified in order to improve its
   efficiency. The `'optimal parameter set'' produced by the GA has then
   been used as the starting point for a local optimization procedure based
   on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). The purpose of this paper is
   to investigate the ability of the resulting algorithm, GA-SQP, to find
   the optimal parameter values during calibration of a conceptual
   rainfall-runoff (CRR) model. Two types of analysis were performed. The
   first refers to a theoretical case free of model and data errors, while
   the second refers to a real case in which the rainfall and runoff data
   were affected by evaluation errors. Specifically, in the synthetic data
   study, where the real set of parameters was known a priori, a 100\%
   success rate was observed, and in all cases the number of objective
   function evaluations remained relatively limited.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of the dimensionless cumulant coefficient (gamma,),
   developed in the companion paper (Strupczewski \& Dooge, 1995), is used
   to demonstrate that a linear interpolation between the two limiting
   cases of the Froude number F-o O and F-o 1 provides a good approximation
   to the higher cumulants of the channel response in the intermediate
   range of O < F-o < 1. It is shown that the moments of any order R,
   either about the origin or about the centre follow the same linear
   interpolation rule as that applied to the impulse responses of the
   limiting cases. The first three cumulants are consequently the same in
   model and prototype. The fourth cumulants are made equal through the
   weighting factor of the linear interpolation. A study of the higher
   cumulants for R > 4 shows that the same basic linear interpolation holds
   for R = 5, R = 6, and R = 7 but not for values of R greater than or
   equal to 8. The analysis of the errors involved for R greater than or
   equal to 5 shows that there is zero error for R = 5 and a small relative
   error in the middle of the range for R > 5. For R = 5, R = 6 and R = 7,
   the error function is independent of the length of the channel as well
   as of the Froude number and the channel shape parameter (m).}},

Abstract = {{Approximate storage-reliability-resilience-yield (S-R-R-Y) relationships
   are derived for over-year water supply systems fed by autoregressive lag
   one Gamma and normal inflows. It is shown that a two-state Markov model
   may be exploited along with S-R-R-Y relationships to describe the
   general behaviour of over-year water supply systems. The two-state
   Markov model is also used to relate the probability of n-year no-failure
   operations (the concept of reliability used in the USA) to the
   steady-state probability of a system failure (the concept of reliability
   used in Australia and elsewhere) yielding a unified view of system
   reliability. Resiliency criteria are introduced which indicate whether
   or not a reservoir system is likely to return to normal operations once
   a failure has set in. These criteria indicate that the resilience of an
   over-year water supply system is generally independent of its
   steady-state reliability. The conditions under which finite reservoir
   systems behave like semi-infinite reservoir systems are also documented,
   and a factor is derived which describes the impact of the serial
   correlation of the inflows on the derived S-R-R-Y relationship.}},

Abstract = {{The stage-discharge relationship or rating curve at a river
   cross-section is a fundamental technique in hydrology employed for
   determining discharge from catchments. While river cross-sections are
   inherently variable, it generally takes quite some time for a change in
   cross-section to occur. Thus, where good quality data on stage and
   discharge are available, a stable and representative rating curve may be
   established. However, all too often, the natural variability is
   aggravated by data errors of human origin. These measurement errors
   occur because the routine of periodic flow measurement may be undertaken
   by ill-trained personnel. Such errors resulting from this practice may
   lead to erroneous estimates of available water resources. This study
   discusses the derivation of a single rating curve for the Okavango River
   at Mohembo from measurements containing errors and outliers. It uses
   data transformation procedures, regression techniques and removal of
   outliers to derive a useful rating curve from suspect data. Finally, it
   investigates the possibility of fitting a stochastic model to the
   discharge series. The results suggest that it may be possible to
   estimate missing data with an ARIMA model.}},

   February and June and at some stations in July where the T42 model
   suggested greater warming. Both GCMs resulted in a slight decrease in

   In this paper, two techniques, namely a seasonal ARIMA model and
   Winter's exponential smoothing model, have been investigated for their
   applicability for forecasting weekly reference crop ET. A seasonal ARIMA
   model with one autoregressive and one moving average process and with a
   seasonality of 52 weeks was found to be an appropriate stochastic model.
   The ARIMA and Winter's models were compared with a simple ET model to
   assess their performance in forecasting. The forecast errors produced by
   these models were very small and the models would be promisingly of
   great use in real-time irrigation management.}},

Abstract = {{An approach for better understanding of the physical implication of
   estimated aquifer parameters is demonstrated by analysing the pumping
   test data at Cottam in the Nottingham aquifer, UK. A sensitivity
   analysis showed that the area represented by the estimated parameters
   was much smaller than the area covered by the depression cone. After
   parameters are estimated, further research should be carried out to
   understand what portions of the aquifer the parameters represent. The
   parameters estimated at Cottam represented mainly aquifer features
   between roughly 100 and 2000 m. The sensitivity analysis also showed
   that the observed drawdown being satisfactorily matched by a model with
   uniform parameters does not prove that the aquifer is homogeneous.
   Slightly anomalous data may imply the existence of large anomalous
   zones. Although the drawdowns at Cottam could be `satisfactorily' fitted
   by a model with uniform parameters, the fit could be improved by a model
   using a more permeable aquifer but with a zone about 700 m wide and with
   42\% less transmissivity.}},

Abstract = {{Using a combination of laboratory and field experiments, the performance
   of a Partech Instruments Ltd IR40-C active head suspended solids sensor
   has been tested with respect to changing particle size distribution and
   rapid variation in suspended sediment transport rate. The sensor, which
   utilizes light attenuation in the infrared waveband, has several
   advantages both over visible light optical designs and over nuclear or
   optical back-scatter (OBS) devices. Three sets of laboratory tests are
   reported: calibration experiments using estuarine, pro-glacial and
   control media; flume simulations of pulsed sediment supply at a variety
   of frequencies, concentrations and ambient flow velocities; and simple
   tests for the effect of air bubbles within the sensor light path. The
   sensor was also deployed in the field, together with an electromagnetic
   current meter, to monitor flow and suspended sediment transport
   fluctuations in the turbulent frequency range. Although the sensor
   performed well with respect to drift, noise and stability of
   calibration, significant variation occurred with respect to suspensions
   of differing particle sizes. A simple correction procedure involving the
   weighting of sensor output by specific particle surface area may enable
   comparison of turbidity data from different locations and times, and
   with standard calibration solutions. At high frequencies, the sensor is
   capable of resolving fluctuations in the transport rate to c. 0.5 s,
   which appears to correspond well to field observations of significant
   velocity fluctuation and transport `events' and is comparable with
   results obtained using OBS devices. However, the resolution of transport
   fluctuations is again dependent upon particle characteristics, and the
   presence of air bubbles in the flow whose size approximates the path
   width of the sensor may mimic a fluctuating transport process. Further
   interpretation of high frequency measurement awaits research into the
   fundamentals of rapidly varying flow and sediment transport
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{The natural variability of precipitation in agricultural regions both in

   is placed on the three stages of the model building procedure, namely
   identification, parameter estimation and diagnostic checking. In the
   parameter estimation stage the polytope (or simplex) method and three
   further classical nonlinear optimization algorithms are used, namely two
   conjugate gradient methods and a quasi-Newton method. The polytope
   method has been adopted and the developed model performed well in

Abstract = {{The spatio-temporal variability of daily precipitation series was

   examined by drawing composite correlation diagrams for the cool
   (October-March) season and the warm (April-September) season, and the
   results confirmed the regional homogeneity of the data sets.
   Furthermore, the temporal analysis indicated that the non-rainy days
   constituted the major portion of days throughout the year at all the
   stations. Similarly, light rainfall represented the majority of rainy
   days. Moreover, the annual rainfall variation showed high values in
   March, April and November with low values occurring in the summer and
   autumn. A sharp increase of rainfall between the 185th and the 195th day
   of the year must be taken into account when the harvest is scheduled.
   Harmonic and Power Spectrum analyses applied to the annual variation of
   rain depths using 5-day intervals revealed significant periodicities of

Abstract = {{An important characteristic of a river flow regime type is the time of
   year when high and low flows are likely to occur. How likely is it,
   however, to observe an identified seasonal pattern each individual year?
   Stability is an often neglected property of a flow regime, though shifts
   in the seasonal behaviour of flows affect both environmental and
   economic activities. An approach to characterize objectively the
   stability of a flow regime type, based on the concept of entropy, is
   presented. The stabilities of river flow maxima and minima are studied
   separately to investigate their respective contributions to the
   stability character of a particular regime type. A quantitative
   `'instability index'' permits a study of the development of a flow
   regime's stability in time, especially important in the context of a
   possible climate change. The method is presented using the example of a
   quantitative flow regime classification developed for Scandinavia and

Abstract = {{A composite model for real time forecasting of flash floods in the
   Ayalon stream in central Israel has been constructed. The model is
   composed of four kinds of sub-models: an autoregressive model for

   travel-time model for the flow from these stations to the downstream
   station located on the main stem of the stream; a time-area
   concentration curve for sub-watershed drainage between the upstream and
   downstream stations; and a recession curve for the downstream station.
   The model incorporates an adaptive mechanism for continuous correction
   of forecast errors. This mechanism is calibrated during an initial
   period of operation, and is subsequently operated throughout a flow
   event. The model issues simultaneous forecasts for seven lead times
   ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 h. This provides a proper input for a flood

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a field-scale model that
   simulates the nitrogen (N) cycle in grazed grassland within a
   catchment-scale management model which can predict the loading and
   concentration of nitrate in rivers. The development is comprised of the
   addition of two sub-models of nitrate transport: one relating the amount
   of soil nitrate to its concentration in drainage water for different
   types of soil, and the second accounting for the proportion of permeable
   rock underlying the catchment. The sub-model that calculates the supply
   and transport of soil nitrate has been made sensitive to annual patterns
   of weather according to a classification based on the maximum soil water
   deficit. The model predictions were tested against best estimates of
   annual load and peak concentration of nitrate in rivers draining 11
   small, predominantly grassland, catchments in the UK during the period
   1974-1987.}},

Abstract = {{The potential impacts of a hypothetical climate change induced by a rise
   of the concentration of greenhouse gases on the water cycle of the
   Sagana River basin (Central Kenya) have been assessed. For this purpose,
   by fitting the IRMB daily conceptual hydrological model to this basin, a
   water balance assessment for the period 1978-1988 was performed. The
   model parameters having been optimized, climate change scenarios were
   adopted, mainly from General Circulation Models. Three scenarios
   differing only by rainfall modification were considered (i.e. rises of
   0\%, 5\% and 10\%). New water balances under those assumptions were
   compiled and a sensitivity study performed. Conditional to the adopted
   climate change scenario, the results showed a general tendency towards
   improved water resources for this equatorial basin during the dry
   seasons in the 10\% rainfall rise scenario. On the other hand, a
   reduction of the water resources was simulated if no rainfall increase
   was adopted in the climate scenario. Negative impacts could be feared in
   this case. The scenario with an intermediate 5\% rainfall increase led
   to a position of status quo.}},

   residual PAH concentrations were monitored during 45 weeks in the
   presence of 10, 100 and 500 mg kg(-1) SDS. The SDS was effective in

   the biodegradation of fluorene, phenanthrene and all of the four-ring
   PAHs. PAHs with more than four rings were not biodegraded. The

Abstract = {{A model has been developed to estimate runoff volumes from generally
   available geophysical data. Most of the hydrological processes are
   modelled in a realistic manner and the model needs only one fitting
   parameter. Input to the model consists of monthly rainfall, evaporation
   and parameters. In the model, rainfall is partitioned, depending on soil
   water status, into soil water storage, groundwater recharge and surface
   runoff. Surface runoff and baseflow are separate outputs of the model
   and equal emphasis has been placed on estimating each of these flow
   components. To do this a technique has been developed for estimating
   recharge. The model has been shown to reproduce observed monthly flows
   in eastern Australian streams very well, both on catchments used to
   calibrate the model and in independent tests where it was used without
   any local calibration data. This ability to provide good estimates of
   volumes of flow on ungauged catchments with very modest requirements for
   input data means the model could find wide application. The evidence of
   accurate estimation of runoff volumes in an independent test in a wide
   range of climatic and geophysical environments is suggested to result

Abstract = {{In 1988, the US Geological Survey began a study of the effects of
   potential climate change on the water resources of the Gunnison River
   basin. The Gunnison River, in southwestern Colorado, is an important
   tributary of the Colorado River, contributing approximately 40\% of the
   flow of the Colorado River at the Colorado/Utah stateline. As part of
   the study, the sensitivity of annual and seasonal runoff in the East
   River basin, a sub-basin of the Gunnison River basin, to changes in
   temperature and precipitation was examined. To perform the sensitivity
   analyses, hypothetical climate changes were used to alter current time
   series of temperature and precipitation. The altered time series were
   then used as inputs to a hydrological model that translated these inputs
   into estimates of runoff. Mean annual and seasonal runoff resulting from
   a range-of-hypothetical climate changes were compared and evaluated.
   Results indicated that in general, changes in precipitation had a larger
   effect on changes in runoff than did changes in temperature. Changes in
   precipitation had significant effects on runoff during all seasons.
   Changes in temperature primarily affected the temporal distribution of
   runoff through the year. Changes in temperature affected the timing of
   snowmelt and the ratio of rain to snow, and therefore the effects of
   temperature were particularly significant during the spring and summer
   seasons. On an annual basis, increases in temperature led only to slight
   decreases in runoff. Results also indicated that the effects of an
   increase in mean annual temperature of 4 degrees C on annual runoff
   could be offset by an increase in annual precipitation of between 4 and
   5\%, and that the magnitude of natural climatic variability was large
   and might mask the effects of long term climate changes.}},

   retention of Fe. Organically-bound Fe and Fe oxides were the major
   species in all the soils. Moreover, soil water analyses suggested that
   sulphate reduction occurs, with the formation of Fe-sulphides during
   seasons with high microbiological activity. Comparable sulphate
   concentrations in groundwater and runoff waters, but much lower

Abstract = {{A fracture map is an essential aid in the study of fissured aquifers
   even though it often includes covered areas where the fractures are not
   visible. Is it possible to predict fracturing or permeable zones under
   the cover? This problem is dealt with using a stochastic approach based
   on fracture density. Classical methods of fracture density assessment
   involve several biases and are not adapted to hydrogeology. A proposed
   `'fracture density index'' (FDI) eliminates these biases and gives
   weight to two important parameters influencing the hydraulic
   conductivity of a zone: length and proximity of long fractures. The FDI
   is a regionalized variable and allows one to make predictions by kriging
   over covered zones. The proposed method has been applied to the
   Campoussy site (Pyrenees Orientales, France). In contrast to previous
   methods, the FDI predictions were in good agreement with the apparent
   hydraulic transmissivity and electrical anisotropy. The results were
   promising but the method needs to be tested on other sites before being

Abstract = {{Estimation of direct runoff volume and peak runoff rates for small rural
   catchments in Kenya, East Africa, poses a problem in view of the limited
   gauged data available. The problem can be circumvented by adopting a
   modelling approach. This, however, does require some base data for model
   calibration and validation. A highly reliable data base for two small
   catchments, Sambret (7.02 km(2)) and Lagan (5.44 km(2)), for nearly 22
   years (1958-1980) is used in the present study. These catchments lie in
   the headwaters of the Lake Victoria drainage basin in Kenya and were
   intensively instrumented by the former East African Agricultural and
   Forestry Research Organisation (EAAFRO). In the Sambret catchment, 41
   rainfall-runoff events were available, out of which 25 were used for
   model calibration while the other 16 were used for validation. To
   further verify the applicability of the models to different catchments,
   18 events from the neighbouring Lagan catchment were also used. The SCS
   curve number procedure proposed by the United States Soil Conservation
   Service was used to estimate the direct runoff volumes. The curve
   numbers were derived from storm rainfall-runoff relationships and the
   results obtained were satisfactory. Peak runoff rates were derived by
   both Nash and kinematic wave models for the estimated runoff volumes.
   The Nash model gave acceptable results in both Sambret and Lagan. The
   kinematic wave model performed well in Sambret only; in Lagan, it
   under-predicted the peak runoff rates.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different land uses, viz agriculture, grassland and
   afforestation, were evaluated in comparison with untreated ravine waste
   land in ustifluvent soil susceptible to gully erosion under a semiarid
   climate. The infiltration was measured with constant head double ring
   infiltrometers. Saturated hydraulic conductivities for the study sites
   were computed with a clay based equation and a texture based equation.
   The difference between the final infiltration rate (after 180 min) and
   the saturated hydraulic conductivity was taken to be the effect of
   different land uses on the infiltration characteristics of the sites.
   The saturated hydraulic conductivities (K-s) calculated by the two
   methods were comparable for loamy sand soil. The two K-s values were
   different for sandy loam soil. The ravine proper and farming up and down
   cultivation practice under grazing and trampling etc. were found to have
   suppressed the infiltration rate. Agricultural land use on terraces
   showed a marginal increase. Thus, the study demonstrated a way of
   isolating the effect of different land uses using a simple method for
   the estimation of saturated hydraulic conductivity for ustifluvent
   soils. For structure-dominated soils a more precise determination of
   saturated hydraulic conductivity will be necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The artificial neural network (ANN) approach described in this paper for
   the synthesis of reservoir inflow series differs from the traditional
   approaches in synthetic hydrology in the sense that it belongs to a
   class of data-driven approaches as opposed to traditional model driven
   approaches. Most of the time series modelling procedures fall within the
   framework of multivariate autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models.
   Formal statistical modelling procedures suggest a four-stage iterative
   process, namely, model selection, model order identification, parameter
   estimation and diagnostic checks. Although a number of statistical tools
   are already available to follow such a modelling process, it is not an
   easy task, especially if higher order vector ARMA models are used. This
   paper investigates the use of artificial neural networks in the field of
   synthetic inflow generation. The various steps involved in the
   development of a neural network and a multivariate autoregressive model
   for synthesis are presented. The application of both types of model for
   synthesizing monthly inflow records for two reservoir sites is
   explained. The performance of the neural network is compared with the
   statistical method of synthetic inflow generation.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of discharge, temperature and suspended sediment made at a
   gauging site established near the snout of the Dokriani glacier in the
   western Himalayan region are presented. These observations were made
   during a scientific expedition to this glacier over 21 days
   (23.8.1992-12.9.1992). Because of harsh weather conditions, observations
   could not be made for a longer period. The minimum streamflow in the
   glacier melt stream was observed at 0700 h whereas the maximum was
   observed at 1800 h. The ratio of maximum to minimum flow was computed to
   be 1.81 from the continuous hourly observations. Based on an analysis of
   the recession of the hydrograph, it was found that the meltwater time
   lag from the accumulation zone of the glacier was more than seven times
   higher than that from the ablation zone. No specific relationship was
   observed between suspended sediment and discharge. The average values of
   the suspended sediment concentration and load were found to be 350 ppm
   and 180 t day(-1) respectively, for the study period. Weathering
   processes in different zones of the glacier were also studied to find
   out the source of the sediment transported by the meltwater into the
   melt stream. A high correlation coefficient (r = 0.89) was found between
   the glacier specific runoff and the air temperature at the gauging site.
   It showed that temperature alone can represent the melting of the
   glacier and may be considered for the hydrological modelling of glacier
   melt runoff. Based on observations over three days under clear weather
   conditions for isolated snow blocks, the average snowmelt factor was
   computed to be 5.4 mm/(degrees C. 6 h).}},

Abstract = {{Monthly mean data collected for a 90 year period (1901-1990) have been
   used to study long term water temperature trends at 10 river sites in
   Austria. Significant increases in monthly mean values were evident over
   the study period for seven river stations, but the magnitude of the rise
   Varied from 0.47 to 1.26 degrees C and its pattern was not uniform
   between catchments. River temperature trends for individual months also
   ranged from increases of >2.5 degrees C, through no significant change,
   to decreases of > 1.0 degrees C. Rises in water temperature during the
   twentieth century appear to reflect, at least in part, the increasing
   impact of human activity on Austrian rivers. Progressive regulation of
   main rivers, such as the Danube and Inn, has resulted in strong
   increases in mean water temperatures during the low flow period of
   autumn but not in the summer months when high flows generally occur.
   Different trends were evident for sites closer to glacial runoff
   sources, for catchments containing a large proportion of lakes, and for
   stations influenced by point source discharges and other local factors.
   Rising mean water temperatures at the end of the study period were
   related more to the occurrence of mild winters than to the incidence of

Abstract = {{The Hadejia-Nguru Wetlands produce agricultural, fishing and fuelwood
   benefits of upto 1277 Naira ha(-1) (N1 = US\$22, October 1994), over
   five times the productivity of formal irrigation schemes. The wetlands
   play a vital role in aquifer recharge. The key is the annual wet season
   flooding of over 2000 km(2) in the 1960s and around 1500 km(2) in the
   1970s. A water balance model, utilizing monthly hydrological and
   meteorological data simulates flood extent and groundwater storage
   within the wetlands. The model was operated between 1964 and 1987 and
   was calibrated using observed flood extents ranging from 50 to 3265
   km(2). Subsequently elements were added for dams and irrigation schemes.
   Results indicate that full implementation of all the schemes constructed
   or planned would cause flooding to be less than 375 km(2) for 60\% of
   the time and groundwater storage to fall by over 5500 10(6) m(3) It is
   possible to define an operating regime for the basin's hydraulic
   structures which could provide artificial floods and enable a
   distribution of water between formal irrigation, small scale irrigators,
   the wetlands and downstream users. This regime would provide assured
   flooding, of around 1000 km(2) each year, and a reduced loss of
   groundwater storage. Such a sustainable development scheme could offset
   decades of piecemeal development and bring a philosophy which emphasizes
   water use throughout the basin not just in irrigation in the upper
   reaches.}},

Abstract = {{After the forest fire that swept across the Massif des Maures (Southern
   France) in August 1990, a drastic change in the hydrological cycle was
   observed on the small burnt catchment of Rimbaud (Real Collobrier ERB).
   Along with the usual hydrological and hydrochemical measurements, stable
   isotopes were measured for rainfall and runoff. Vegetation disappearance
   and, consequently, the influence on throughfall encouraged a comparison
   of oxygen IX content with chloride content. During the flood of 9
   December 1990, these two elements showed a very similar behaviour, and
   it was interesting to notice that the hydrograph separations obtained by
   isotopic methods were comparable. When the usual factors of chloride and
   oxygen 18 evolution were examined, 45\% usual factors of chloride and
   oxygen 18 evolution were examined, 45\% of runoff came from `'ancient''
   water and, in this case, the unsaturated area did not play a significant

Abstract = {{Design and operation of water resources management systems in many
   countries, particularly in the developing world, very often suffer from
   inadequate hydrological data. Consequently, many water resources
   management projects in the Third World do not function as optimally as
   they are supposed to since long uninterrupted time series of data are
   often not available for the assessment of the performance and
   reliability of the projects. Besides data inaccuracy, inadequate data
   may comprise the total absence or incompleteness (in terms of length of
   records) of data or irregular observation periods, leading to a number
   of gaps or discontinuities in the series. Infilling of missing sections
   of data is often necessary prior to the practical use of hydrological
   time series. It was the aim of this research study to find the most
   effective ways of infilling the numerous missing runoff data most
   commonly associated with Third World data based on a simple Decision
   Support System (DSS) valid in West Africa.}},

Abstract = {{Forest drainage networks are open ditches excavated for lowering the
   groundwater level in wetland areas to improve growing conditions for the
   trees. This procedure creates longer discharge surfaces for input to
   groundwater and shorter pathways for groundwater and overland flow to
   the channel system, which in turn, changes the basic runoff processes in
   the catchment. The hydrological effects of forest drainage have been the
   subject of studies for many years but the conclusions reached are
   conflicting because of the diversity of conditions as well as the
   constraints of data availability and the limited accuracy of the methods
   applied. This study applied three techniques (the control basin method,
   as well as conceptual and distributed models) for examining whether or
   not forest drainage increased peak flows. Small basins were
   investigated, and estimated parameters were transferred to a larger
   basin. This paper briefly presents the case study areas, the research
   concept and the methods applied. The computations showed that the peak
   flows decreased in general after drainage works. According to all three
   methods, the effect on the peak flows was larger after dry periods.
   Event simulations made by the Systeme Hydrologique Europeen (SHE) model
   suggested that the highest peak flows could be increased by drainage in
   cases of intensive rainstorms in catchments with already high (close to
   the soil surface) groundwater level. The general tendency of the
   drainage effects was that a lowered groundwater level had greater
   influence on peak flow formation than the increased channel conveyance
   capacity in the drained catchments.}},

Abstract = {{Forest harvesting practices have been shown to have a hydrological
   impact that is akin to bushfire regeneration. Fine resolution fossil
   pollen studies in the upper Delegate River basin, East Gippsland,
   Australia, have revealed large changes in the reproductive activity of
   aquatic plants synchronous with the onset of harvesting activities. This
   paper seeks to establish an explanation for these changes by applying a
   2-parameter regional bushfire yield trend model to the wet eucalypt
   forests above the pollen core site. Using histories of piecemeal coupe
   (harvesting plot) development, the model was used to reconstruct annual
   runoff yields between 1970 and 1991 assuming zero harvesting. The
   results indicated a progressive reduction in simulated annual yields
   (relative to the zero disturbance scenario) attaining between 20 and 55
   \% loss by 1987/1988. Given the historic rate of harvesting, over a 50
   \% reduction of water yield is expected to occur by 2005 due to factors
   including enhanced forest transpiration. Such hydrological changes would
   have significant implications for downstream fauna and flora and for

   indicated that the heterogeneous hillslope aquifer provides

   depending on the extent of snowmelt recharge. The spatial and temporal
   distribution and amount of snowmelt recharge play important roles in
   determining when flow is governed by confined and unconfined flow.
   Results showed that the VAM2D model was able to simulate piezometric

Abstract = {{Estimation of soil loss from single storm events is essential for basin
   planning and nonpoint source pollution control. Rainfall-runoff
   erosivity factors for single storm events in northern Iraq were derived
   from the basic theory of soil detachment and transport. The factors
   derived are a single parameter which includes runoff depth only and a
   factor which combines runoff depth and peak rate. These two erosivity
   factors gave satisfactory results when tested using data from natural
   runoff plots collected at different sites in the region. The same data
   were then used to test the applicability of various established
   erosivity factors. The two derived erosivity factors were superior to
   any known erosivity factor tested in the region. These include factors
   currently in use in Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) applications in
   different parts of the world.}},

   \% and 15 \% of rainfall respectively. Evapotranspiration was 63 \% of

   level occurred in the suburban catchment, and garden watering probably
   balanced the high evaporation. Piped water supply was 16 \% of the

Abstract = {{In the absence of long-term records of sediment transport by UK rivers,
   sediment deposits in lakes and reservoirs offer considerable potential
   for estimating sediment yields and reconstructing changing patterns of
   sediment yield and sediment sources during the past century in response
   to environmental change. An investigation of the sediment deposits
   within the Old Mill Reservoir, located in the East Hams region of South
   Devon, UK, has shown that suspended sediment yields from the 1.58 km2
   catchment have averaged ca. 54 t km-2 year-1 over the period 1942 to
   1991. Bedload transport from the catchment during the same period
   averaged 15 t km-2 year-1. The sediment record also provided evidence of
   increasing productivity in the reservoir during recent years and of the
   impact of a single extreme event. The availability of several dateable
   horizons within the sediment cores made it possible to subdivide further
   the reconstructed record of sediment yield into four periods. This
   subdivision indicated that suspended sediment yields have increased more
   than fourfold since the Second World War from about 20 t km-2 year-1 to
   ca. 90 t km-2 year-1. A variety of sediment properties, including
   mineral magnetic characteristics and caesium-137 activity, was used to
   fingerprint the dominant source of the deposited sediment. This
   fingerprint analysis indicated that, with the exception of the extreme
   event, the sediment sources have remained essentially constant
   throughout the period of record and that surface material from pasture
   areas represented the dominant source. The increase of suspended
   sediment yields during the postwar period was attributed to increased
   livestock numbers and grazing intensity in the catchment of the
   reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{The object of this paper is to discuss, using the example of the upper
   basin of the Garonne river, the conditions of use of radar for the
   measurement of precipitation in order to forecast floods in areas with
   substantial relief and a cold season, which is the case for most French
   basins. The principle of radar measurement of precipitation fields is
   summarily expounded and the factors influencing the quality of these
   measurements are presented, notably those in relation to the relief and
   climatology of precipitation and to the 0-degrees-C isotherm
   (precipitation melting level). The main difficulty is that, at
   mid-latitudes, the precipitation melting layer (i.e. the 0-degrees-C
   isotherm) is located at low altitude, which implies that, except in
   summer, radar does not observe a homogeneous scattering environment viz.
   rain or snow. Most of the time, the radar beam reaches, at a short
   distance, the altitude of the upper limit of the rain. This problem is
   made worse in mountainous areas because, for the azimuthal sweeping of
   the radar beam, significant elevation angles need to be used in order to
   avoid ground echoes.}},

   (RAB). Monte Carlo simulation was conducted for four selected LP3
   populations. As compared with the method of moments, larger reductions
   in standard root mean square error (SRMSE) and standard bias (SBIAS) for
   quantile prediction can be achieved by the new method for small sample
   sizes and large return periods of quantiles. In addition, the new method

   snowfall showed a generally significant correlation with annual
   discharge. Elevation did not appear to play a strong role in determining
   the usefulness of these measurements, whereas location within the basin

Abstract = {{For a long time now, the hydrologist has been faced with the problem of

   has been mainly due to the insufficiency of the conventional

   probability distributions. In this study, the Akaike Information
   Criterion (AIC) goodness-of-fit test is used to identify more
   objectively the optimum model for flood frequency analysis in Kenya from
   a class of competing models. The class is comprised of (a) seven
   three-parameter density functions, namely, log-normal, Pearson,
   log-Pearson, Fisher-Tippet, log-Fisher-Tippet, Walter Boughton and
   log-Walter Boughton; and (b) two five-parameter density functions,

   method of testing for the existence of outlier peak-flow values in the

Abstract = {{The neutron probe method for in situ measurement of field capacity was
   applied to ferrallitic soils on the Kossou Lakeside slope (Ivory coast).
   For better utilisation of the natural resources, a study was conducted
   to determine the influence of the lake on the availability of soil water
   to plants along the lakeside slope. Two methods, one gravimetric and the
   other neutronic, were used to evaluate soil water content and its
   variation with time. Five access tubes were placed along the slope and
   were monitored during the study. The infiltration rate determined at
   three of the measuring sites was higher in the top soil layers than in
   the deeper soil layers. Drainage and redistribution data show a
   juxtaposition of two infiltration kinetics, the first being exponential
   and the second linear. The, extrapolation of the second kinetic (slow)
   to the start of drainage gave, for the first 600 mm of soil, field
   capacities of 154, 184 and 163 mm for sites T1, T3 and T5 respectively.
   These differences were specifically related to the porosity of the sites
   under study. An analysis of the soil water profiles showed that the soil
   moisture near the lake was always higher than the permanent wilting
   point. The influence of the lake was not apparent during the long rainy
   season because of the steady decline of the water table. The water
   availability then depended upon the rainfall distribution and the
   specific characteristics of each of the sites, especially soil texture
   and structure. A linear relationship was found between soil moisture
   estimated by the neutronic and the gravimetric methods with correlation
   coefficients ranging from 0. 80 to 0. 96. The data also showed that the
   neutron probe method did not systematically underestimate the soil
   moisture of the top layers. This response seemed to be associated with
   the fraction of coarse sand. As soil moisture increased, data from the
   neutron probe method converged toward the gravimetric data regardless of
   the site.}},

Abstract = {{Helium has several characteristics which make it attractive for use as a
   tracer in hydrological studies. These include its inert nature,
   relatively high solubility in water (approximately 1\%), low molecular
   diffusion in water, ready availability in commercial quantities,
   nontoxic nature, and low background atmospheric concentration. The use
   of helium as a tracer of water movement has become possible through the
   development of an instrument which takes advantage of the fact that at
   room temperature helium diffuses through a quartz glass membrane at a
   rate of three to four orders of magnitude greater than any other gas.
   This paper describes: (i) a set of experiments undertaken to compare
   breakthrough of helium with common salt (NaCl) tracer through laboratory
   sand columns; (ii) a set of groundwater tracing experiments conducted in
   a basaltic aquifer in Central O'ahur, Hawaii and (iii) two laboratory
   experiments undertaken to evaluate the applicability of helium
   instrumentation for the tracing of submerged plumes in open water
   conditions. The test results demonstrate that helium behaves as a
   conservative tracer during saturated flow through porous media. During
   unsaturated flow, exchange of helium with air entrained in the porous
   media reduces its usefulness. During submerged flow of a labelled plume,
   helium behaves like fluorescein in a relatively tranquil laboratory tank
   environment for hours but is grudually lost through the air-water
   interface, thus limiting the usefulness of helium in shallow plume
   tracing studies to short duration experiments.}},

Abstract = {{For about two decades remote sensing (RS) data in the form of
   multi-spectral air photography, ground based weather radar as well as
   geostationary and polar orbiting satellite data have been available for
   use in hydrology. It is the intention of this paper to advocate the use
   of RS data in the field of hydrological modelling. It is shown that the
   main field of application of RS data in hydrological modelling lies in
   the meso-scale. The potential of RS in the framework of GIS is shown
   along with three examples. The first example shows the use of RS data
   for rainfall/runoff modelling in the lower meso-scale. A model was
   developed which used the high spatial resolution of Landsat polar
   orbiting satellites (30m X 30m) for model parameter estimation. The
   second example shows the use of geostationary satellite data for the
   computation of long time series of monthly runoff values in the upper
   meso-scale. It was applied in West Africa for the purpose of water
   resources planning. In the third example, a water balance model in the
   upper meso-scale is presented which computes daily values for all the
   variables in the water balance equation along with an example of the
   model's application in the international Mosel River basin. Here also
   the detection of land use changes by multi-temporal satellite imagery
   and their impact on hydrological parameters is discussed. In this
   example, emphasis is put on the combination of RS data with other
   information, such as digital elevation models or digitized maps, all
   within the framework of GIS. In conclusion, not only the potential but
   also the limitations of the use of RS in hydrological modelling are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A study was conducted to develop a computer model to simulate the
   spatial variability of field-measured saturated hydraulic conductivity

   and in the laboratory, were made at 150 and 300 mm depths at regular
   intervals of 4.6 m on two perpendicular transects crossing each other at
   the centre of a no-till field. Three Fourier series models, with a
   finite number of harmonics, were developed to simulate the variability
   in K(s) values. These models included the regular Fourier series model,
   the half-range Fourier series model with only cosine terms, and the
   half-range Fourier series model with only sine terms. Also, a test of
   significance was conducted with the first five and eight terms of the
   Fourier series models. This test indicated that with only five or eight
   terms model performances were not significantly different from each
   other at the 0.05 level. The overall results of this study indicated
   that spatial variability in the K measurements made with both
   techniques, field and laboratory, can be represented successfully with
   half-range Fourier series with only cosine terms. Statistical analysis
   of predicted and observed K(s) values indicated that the two sets were

   while the durations of long droughts are normally distributed. As
   drought duration and deficit are highly correlated, similar probability
   distributions apply to the deficits. The starting date of droughts can

Abstract = {{Water balance models have been used to examine trends in the level of
   Lake Victoria over this century. A monthly model developed in a previous
   study for the period 1925 to 1978 has been improved and the simulation
   period extended to 1990. Also, an annual model has been used to extend
   the water balance back to the start of the century. The simulations
   confirm the results from previous studies which showed that the observed
   variations in lake level can be explained primarily in terms of natural
   variations in rainfall over the lake and surrounding basin. An idealized
   interpretation of these variations is presented which illustrates the
   long response time of this large lake and which is used to speculate on
   the likely future behaviour of the lake.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparison between an L2 estimator and an L1
   estimator for solving parameter identification problems in groundwater
   flow and solute transport simulation. The L1 estimator is formulated
   using a weighted L1-norm as the error measure between the vector of the

   simulated heads and concentrations. The simulation model is comprised of
   a finite element formulation for steady-state groundwater flow and
   solute transport in a two-dimensional vertically averaged aquifer
   system. The gradients of the state variables with respect to the
   parameters are computed using a state sensitivity method. Posterior
   statistical inferences are conducted. The solutions to two sets of
   hypothetical groundwater parameter estimation problems illustrate that
   the L1 estimator is more robust than the L2 estimator in handling

Abstract = {{Rainfall and runoff depths were examined for 763 storms on 26 urban
   basins located in 12 countries. For 17 of the basins, impervious
   surfaces were the major contributors to storm runoff. These basins were
   generally smaller than 25 ha and had small to medium storms in the data
   set. Nine basins had significant amounts of runoff from pervious as well
   as impervious surfaces. Eight of these basins are located in Australia.
   For all 26 basins, plots of rainfall and runoff depths were used to
   estimate the effective impervious area and the impervious area initial
   loss. The data plotted close to a single straight line on all basins,
   indicating that the effective impervious area remained constant for all
   storm sizes. The effective impervious fraction was related to total
   impervious area and the directly connected impervious fraction estimated
   from maps. For the basins with pervious runoff, the depth of rain in the
   storm was the most important factor in determining pervious runoff for
   rainfalls less than 50 mm, while for larger storms other factors
   including rainfall intensity and antecedent wetness were also found to
   be significant.}},

Abstract = {{The Algerian northeast region is characterized by a transitional
   Mediterranean climate marked by seasonal oscillations (in summer, the
   climate is rather subtropical, making the hot season one of the longest,
   while in winter, it has much more in common with a temperate zone
   climate). In the area of Skikda, this difference, combined with
   prominent relief, leads to very large spatio-temporal variations in
   rainfall. The precipitation type is somewhat torrential. To solve water
   problems in rural areas, one must use efficient techniques and practical
   methods. Deficiency of rainfall data is one of the problems that
   projects may encounter, especially while studying land remediation or
   improvement. Two parameters are presented in this article. The first
   relates to the average yearly rainfall amount, a quantity which occurs
   in many aspects in hydrology, where its evaluation depends on a dense
   network of properly set up raingauges or interpolation from pluviometric
   maps which, in the geographical context of the region, leads to less
   precise and sometimes wrong results. The study of interfactorial
   correlations is the appropriate solution. The second parameter concerns
   the average maximal intensity, the main element in the study of floods,
   whose estimation presents problems as far as the lack of appropriate
   data is concerned. The proposed method is rather classical and simple
   using the average and commonly available data in all rainfall stations.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of acidic precipitation on stream chemistry were measured on
   an east-central Pennsylvania basin. When combined with flow and chemical
   mass balances, the data can help quantify hydrological source areas and
   their contributions to acidic storm hydrographs. For small storms on the
   well-buffered agricultural basin, small volumes of acidic precipitation
   falling directly on the stream surface react with more alkaline inflows
   from subsurface flow and surface runoff components to reduce streamflow
   pH temporarily by approximately one-half unit. During larger storms, the
   pH of surface runoff approaches that of precipitation, causing a
   relatively large acidic loading to the stream. However, this large input
   is buffered by a correspondingly larger subsurface flow component which
   results in stream pH reductions similar to those observed during the
   smaller events. Hydrological interpretations derived from a pH based
   mass balance are reinforced by a mass balance based on electrical
   conductivity and are consistent with the variable source area concept of
   basin hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{Conceptual semi-distributed hydrological models are developed for a
   limited consideration of spatial heterogeneity of hydrological
   characteristics within a river basin. This heterogeneity can be
   described by area distribution functions of hydrological characteristics
   which can be estimated in a most effective way by a Geographical
   Information System (GIS). It is shown how the application of a GIS can
   support the development and the calibration of a conceptual hydrological
   model. GIS information is used to establish the criteria for
   sub-division of the river basin and for estimation of model structures
   (especially for further:horizontal divisions of each basin into more
   homogeneous parts). That information is also used for estimation of
   basin characteristics and their differences between sub-basins as a
   support for parameter calibration by optimization. The methodology
   presented can be used for the development of a model structure on an
   objective basis and for model calibration which considers the physical
   explanation of model parameters. The proposed method was successfully
   applied to a river basin within the Mosel basin (Germany).}},

Abstract = {{A methodology has been developed and applied to an eastern Nebraska,

   500 hPa) CP types and daily precipitation events. Historical data and
   General Circulation Model (GCM) output of daily CPs corresponding to 1 X
   CO2 and 2 x CO2 are considered. Time series of both local and regional
   precipitation corresponding to each of those cases were simulated and
   their statistical properties were compared. Under the dry continental
   climate of eastern Nebraska, a highly variable spatial response to
   climate change was obtained. Most of the local and the regional average
   precipitation values reflect, under 2 x C0(2), a somewhat wetter and a
   more variable precipitation regime in eastern Nebraska. The sensitivity
   of the results to the GCM utilized should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{There are considerable difficulties in assembling global hydrological
   data sets in near real time, data that might be used for deciding
   investment for sustainable water resources development and management,
   for environmental protection and for studying global change. Several
   reasons exist for these difficulties, a new one is that many countries
   have recently been cutting back on hydrological networks and the
   services that operate them. This means that knowledge of the World's
   water resources is getting worse when the global demand for water is
   accelerating. By way of contrast, meteorologists have ready access to
   large volumes of global data, much of it in real time, principally
   through WMO's World Weather Watch (WWW). A World Hydrological Cycle
   Observing System (WHYCOS) is proposed to facilitate access to global
   data and support hydrological services in need. A world-wide network of
   about 1000 stations is planned for the largest rivers, together with
   associated data bases and products to meet the needs of users.  WHYCOS
   would start in Africa with a 100-station network and be expanded to
   other regions. It is a necessary tool for averting the coming water
   crisis and essential to the drive towards sustainable development.}},

Abstract = {{A two-stage formal approach to hydrological model conceptualization is
   described. The approach requires the definition of hydrological
   variables in terms of states and rates, the construction of state-rate
   diagrams and the definition of equations for the rates based on an
   in-depth understanding of the related hydrological processes. It is
   inferred that the approach can help modellers arrive at models which are
   conceptually more feasible for operational use and for theoretical
   studies. STELLA, a programme specifically designed to facilitate model
   conceptualization using this approach, is also briefly described. The
   use of the two stage formal approach with STELLA will be an excellent
   teaching tool for hydrological modelling.}},

Abstract = {{Vertical surface properties of the landscape were measured using a laser
   altimeter mounted in a small twin-engine aeroplane. The laser altimeter
   makes 4000 measurements per second with a vertical recording precision
   of 0.05 m for a single measurement. These airborne laser measurements
   were analysed to provide information on topography, vegetation canopy
   and stream and gully cross-sections. Laser altimeter data were used to
   measure small (less than 0.20 m deep) and large gullies and stream
   cross-sections. Vegetation canopy heights, cover, structure and
   distribution were determined in studies in Texas and Arizona. Laser
   measurements of vegetation cover and height were significantly
   correlated with ground measurements made with line-intercept methods. 
   While conventional ground-based techniques may be used to make all these
   measurements, airborne laser altimeter techniques allow the data to be
   collected in a quick and efficient way over large and inaccessible
   areas. The airborne laser altimeter data can also help quantify various
   land surface parameters needed for natural resource and landscape
   management or required by hydrological simulation models. Measurements
   of landscape properties over large areas provide a better understanding
   of landscape functions and can lead to the development of better
   management plans to conserve and improve the productivity of natural
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{A modified two-level estimator is proposed and implemented for real time
   flood forecasting for a hydrological system plagued by a high order of

   proposed two-level estimator. The results of this coarse estimator are
   combined on the basis of a posterior probability distribution; the
   weighted model thus obtained is fine tuned by a Restricted Exponential
   Forgetting (REF) algorithm based on a fine estimator. In addition to the
   usual link between the coarse estimator and the fine estimator, a
   backward fine-to-coarse estimator link is also suggested. This not only
   helps in the crucial task of compilation of the finite model set of the
   coarse estimator but also materially affects the performance of the

Abstract = {{Most organic materials that contaminate soil and the subsurface
   environment are readily degraded by natural biological processes. To
   this degree, in situ bioremediation can be thought of as a highly
   successful purification process. However, some organic molecules are
   naturally refractory to biodegradation, or other environmental factors
   induce molecular recalcitrance such as the absence of a proper microbial
   population or the presence of unsuitable environmental conditions.
   Examples of recalcitrant groundwater contaminants are soluble components
   of petroleum hydrocarbons (BTEX) and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons
   (CAHs). Organic recalcitrance may be changed through introduction of
   degrading populations of microorganisms or by changing the environmental
   conditions through introduction of nutrients or other chemicals. The
   most significant engineering deficiency in in situ bioremediation is the
   absence of proven methods to introduce such materials into the
   subsurface environment for efficient mixing with microorganisms and the

   using bioventing technology to remediate JP-4 jet fuel contamination in
   a sub-arctic environment and to determine to what degree the
   biodegradation rate of JP-4 soil contaminants could be enhanced by
   increasing soil temperature, both actively by circulating heated

   rates at the bioventing site remained relatively high during the winter
   months in the active-warming test plot and were consistently higher than

Abstract = {{An in situ microbial filter technology is being tested and developed for
   remediating migrating subsurface plumes contaminated with low
   concentrations of trichloroethylene (TCE). The current focus is the
   establishment of a replenishable bioactive zone (catalytic filter) along
   expanding plume boundaries by the injection of a representative
   methanotrophic bacterium, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. This
   microbial filter strategy has been successfully demonstrated using
   emplaced, attached resting cells (no methane additions) in a 1.1 m
   flow-through test bed loaded with water-saturated sand. Two separate 24
   h pulses of TCE (109 ppb and 85 ppb), one week apart, were pumped
   through the system at a flow velocity of 15 mm h-1; no TCE (< 0.5 ppb)
   was detected on the downstream side of the microbial filter. Subsequent
   excavation of the wet sand confirmed the existence of a TCE-bioactive
   zone 21 days after it had been created. An enhanced longevity of the
   cellular, soluble-form methane monooxygenase produced by this
   methanotroph is a result of the laboratory bioreactor culturing
   conditions. Additional experiments with cells in sealed vials and
   emplaced in the 1.1 m test bed yielded a high resting-cell finite TCE
   biotransformation capacity of about 0.25 mg per mg of bacteria; this is
   suitable for a planned sand-filled trench field demonstration at a
   Lawrence Livermore National Laborato site.}},

Abstract = {{Porphyrins are the molecules which are at the heart of most biochemical
   reactions involved in bioremediation. This review paper discusses the
   chemical structures, the biosynthetic pathways and the occurrence of
   porphyrins in the environment. The parallel between the mammalian and
   bacterial cytochrome P-450 enzyme systems and the similarity of the
   reactions at the molecular level is brought to the attention of the
   reader. Experiments where porphyrins and corrinoids are used as
   catalysts in the absence of the enzymes or the bacterial cells are
   opening the field of biochemical remediation, somewhere midway between
   biological and abiotic reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater recharge in arid regions is intermittent and usually occurs
   as a result of flood flow transmission losses in dry wadi channels.
   Hydrograph characteristics play a dominant role in determining the
   amount of channel abstraction in relation to the width of the wetted
   perimeter and the time of inundation, and the subsequent groundwater
   recharge. Large variations in the magnitude of channel losses result
   mainly from the diversity in inflow volumes. The magnitude of
   groundwater recharge in relation to bed transmission losses is dependent
   on flood volume and duration, soil moisture content and physical soil
   profile characteristics. Runoff volume and duration are the dominant
   factors influencing the cumulative infiltrated volume and recharge to
   shallow water tables. Taking into consideration the influence of various
   hydrological and channel characteristics, several regression equations
   are suggested to estimate the transmission losses from a wadi bed and
   the groundwater recharge.}},

Abstract = {{A field study of erosion processes and local responses was carried out
   at representative sites of major soil groups in the Niger delta. The
   soils at these sites varied widely from plastic silty clays to silty
   sands of varying relative densities. Information on soil type,
   stratification and state of compaction together with tidal velocity
   distribution and pool level variation in river channels was used to
   establish predominant mechanics of erosion. The influence of vegetation
   on bank stability is dependent on the stage of growth of the vegetation,
   the relative location of the vegetation in the bank area, the bank
   steepness and its height. Although bamboo trees and raphia palms on
   lower parts of channel banks impede flow, thus aiding sedimentation,
   they may not be effective in checking bank recession. The difficulty of
   achieving an effective bank protection with raphia palms can be overcome
   by an improvement in bank protection design layout along the line of a
   filter which preferentially allows water to escape from the mesh. An
   upper bank protection may not be effective if low bank areas are scoured
   as this results in overhangs which readily fail. Consequently, bank
   protection measures must cover the entire bank profile.}},

Abstract = {{A new system known as `'Pless'' and based on the moving boat method has
   been designed and manufactured at the State Hydrological Institute, St

   fully automatic and the boat is free to move in any trajectory. The
   paper describes the principle of the system, the methodological
   peculiarities of its use, the equipment and the results of field
   measurements in the Neva River. In conclusion, the `'Pless'' system is
   compared with the acoustic discharge measurement system ADCP (Acoustic
   Doppler Current Profilers) designed in the USA. It is concluded that the
   `'Pless'' system may be recommended as a simple and inexpensive but
   effective system for hydrologists which greatly simplifies the often
   difficult procedure of discharge measurements in large rivers.}},

   evaluate how purging, required to obtain representative water quality
   samples, affected measured values of hydraulic conductivity in 15 newly
   installed and undeveloped piezometers placed to between 2 and 15 m depth
   (in oxidized and unoxidized material) in a loamy glacial till (K range
   from  10(-6) to 10(-9) m s-1). Piezometers were purged between 9 and 11
   times for sampling over a period of five months. The effect of the
   purgings on piezometer development was evaluated by changes in slope of
   the water level recovery curves which were used to calculate hydraulic
   conductivity. The first five purgings following piezometer installation
   increased K in the 15 piezometers by an average of 34 \%. The average
   increase in a value of K after 10 purgings was 44 \%. Values measured
   for hydraulic conductivity in a 75 mm diameter auger hole appeared
   stable after four purgings but piezometers installed in larger diameter
   boreholes (100 mm to 280 mm) showed increases in K with up to 10
   purgings. The hydraulic conductivity determined for piezometers

   variability than was observed in the adjacent vertically installed
   piezometers at the same depth.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment is described for continuous recording of bed load

   1990 in the Italian Alps, in a small basin equipped since 1982 with
   instruments conventionally used in hydrological surveys and bed load
   transport measurements. In July 1990, six seismometers were placed along
   the alluvial channel for up to about 150 m upstream of the flow gauging
   station. Continuous microseismic recordings of seven flood flows were
   analysed, five being associated with coarse sediment delivery. The
   mechanism of bed load transport was inferred from two or three
   microseismic impulse peaks occurring before and after the discharge peak
   shown in the hydrograph. Those microseismic peaks are thought to reflect
   the pulsed nature of bed load transport while the periods elapsing
   between them are interpreted as indicating the duration of the transport
   process and appeared independent of peak discharges.}},

Abstract = {{A statistical model comprising nine different probability distributions

   peak series with at least 30 observations for 11 unregulated streams in

   likelihood and probability-weighted moments. The distributions were
   first compared by classical goodness-of-fit tests on the observed
   series. Next, the goodness of predictions of the extreme right-tail
   events by all the models were evaluated through detailed analyses of
   long synthetically generated series. The general extreme value and
   3-parameter lognormal distributions were found to predict the rare
   floods of return periods of 100 years or more better than the other
   distributions used. The general extreme value type 2 and log-Pearson
   type 3 (when skewness is positive) would usually yield slightly
   conservative peaks. The Wakeby distribution also gave peaks mostly on
   the conservative side. The log-logistic distribution with the method of
   maximum likelihood was found to overestimate greatly high return period

Abstract = {{Methods for extrapolating runoff series are important in order to gain
   maximum information from hydrological observations. The main
   disadvantages of traditional methods are that they are subjective and
   often time consuming. In this paper, empirical orthogonal functions
   (EOF) are adapted for the extension of time series. By a linear
   transformation of a set of runoff series from a region, a new set of
   series, EOFs, describing the runoff variations in time, and a set of
   weight coefficients describing the spatial variations, are created.
   Using this information it is possible to extend a runoff series within
   the region. A study has been carried out using Norwegian runoff series
   of daily values. The method was compared both to regression and to use
   of a conceptual model. In general the EOF method gives results as good
   as the traditional methods, and the amount of work involved is minimized
   while the objectivity is maximized.}},

   general model relating the exhaust (Q(t)) proportioned by the cumulative
   extraction of mineral (S(t)) to the effective rainfall (E(t)) is
   proposed. This model can be written in the form of a convolution
   equation: Q(t)/S(t)beta = C + phi(tau)E(t-tau) + epsilon(t) (1) The
   exponent beta depends on the exploitation methods, local geological
   conditions and the thickness of the exploited layer (beta = 0 for the
   stationary and 0 < beta less-than-or-equal-to 1 for the non-stationary

   project carried out for the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry

   precipitation in complex terrain. The orographic component of
   precipitation is conceptually divided into a part directly generated by
   dynamic uplift and a part originating from convective activity. The
   model for the first type of precipitation enhancement is based on the
   theory of linear two-dimensional air flow over mountains. A dynamically
   consistent flow field and explicit simulation of the seeder-feeder
   mechanism are the main improvements compared to an earlier version of
   this model (Haiden et al., 1990). The assessment of convective
   precipitation is based on a new parameterization using results of an
   analytical model of thermally induced upslope flow. A comparison of
   model results with observations shows reasonable agreement regarding the
   structure of the precipitation fields.}},

Abstract = {{The new Swedish guidelines for the estimation of design floods for dams

   snowpack. The new guidelines are applicable to single reservoir systems
   as well as more complex hydroelectric schemes, and cover snowmelt
   floods, rain floods and combinations of the two. In order to study the

Abstract = {{The recently developed guidelines for design flood calculation in Sweden
   are based on simulation with a hydrological model. Several
   meteorological and hydrological conditions are prescribed as input to
   the model. The sensitivity of the floods according to the new guidelines
   with respect to those prescriptions is checked as well as the
   sensitivity to the modelling procedure. In this paper, the HBV
   hydrological model is used. It is shown that the most sensitive input
   factor is the design 14-day precipitation sequence. For autumn floods,
   the scaling relation between the precipitation sequence and the
   generated floods is in the order of 1:1. For spring floods on the other
   hand, snowmelt influences the flood magnitude and reduces the
   sensitivity to precipitation to about 1:0.6. Soil moisture modelling was
   important in basins with high evapotranspiration. Model calibration
   could have a large effect on the design flood magnitude. The most
   sensitive parameter was the high flow recession coefficient, K0. The
   water stage development in a multi-reservoir system is further
   influenced by the regulation strategy and spillway capacity. An
   increased spillway capacity can improve the situation considerably for a
   particular dam but could at the same time worsen the situation for
   downstream dams. After the filling of the reservoir there was a clear
   relation between inflow peak and maximum water stage. The study shows
   that it is difficult to assess the integrated effects of extreme
   precipitation, snowmelt, soil moisture status and regulation in a system
   beforehand.}},

Abstract = {{The Bundelkhand area of central India consists of weathered granitic

   respectively, from the non-irrigated area, the irrigated area and
   surface waters. Concentrations of major ions (including NO3-), PO4= and
   Fe++ were determined. A statistical comparison of the data groups was
   carried out assuming that the only difference between the two areas was
   in agricultural practice. It was discovered that, despite the better
   quality of the surface waters, the irrigated area groundwaters were
   higher in concentration than those of the non-irrigated area. The main
   causes for that appear to be evaporation/transpiration and fertilizer
   application, modified by calcite precipitation and ion exchange. The

   Muskingum solution is examined in two steps. The first step involves a
   physical interpretation bf the Muskingum weighted discharge and the

   analytical solution for the weighted discharge based on linear systems

   analytical solution using the assumption of linear variation of

Abstract = {{EPSAT-NIGER (Estimation of Precipitation by SATellite - NIGER
   experiment) has been designed to improve the understanding of the
   precipitation systems of Sudano-Sahelian Africa and to develop
   operational rainfall estimation algorithms for this region. It is based
   on the combined use of a very dense raingauge network (93 gauges over a
   study area of 16 000 km2) and a C-band weather radar system. The
   experiment is scheduled to last three years, 1990-1992. The network
   pattern, a regular grid with nodes spaced at 12.5 km and a 16 gauge
   target area where the distance between stations is decreased to 1 km,
   has allowed for some preliminary studies on the rainfall distribution at
   various space and time scales. Whereas the long term average rainfall
   gradient is uniform, rainfall increasing north to south, a single rainy
   season can be markedly different. The local variability may be extremely
   large. That variability is enhanced at smaller sampling time steps and
   the computation of reference areal rainfall for satellite imagery
   validation is extremely sensitive to the design of the ground-based
   validation system. The joint processing of gauge and radar data has led
   to the identification of a few typical features of the drop size
   distribution of the African squall lines, which could lead to deriving
   specific algorithms for radar calibration in this region. The data
   provided by EPSAT-NIGER will be used in various international projects
   for the assessment of water input from the atmosphere to the continent
   over the Sahel.}},

Abstract = {{In this analysis, a semi-distributed conceptual runoff model was applied
   in five basins varying in area between 43 and 195 km2, lying in
   different physiographic regions of Switzerland (lowland, alpine, heavily
   glaciated high alpine basins) representing various runoff regimes. An
   objective, labour-intensive optimization procedure was developed and
   found suitable for deriving optimal parameter values. A separate
   calibration procedure was employed in the heavily glaciated basin, as
   glacier mass balance data measured at different elevations were deemed
   very helpful for finding plausible parameter values. The results show
   that this conceptual runoff model can be successfully applied in various
   physiographic regions, without structural changes, to calculate daily
   discharge. However, no conclusive relationships between parameter values
   and basin characteristics could be found. One reason may be that the
   investigated sample was too small. It is also felt that the inherent
   structure of this type of conceptual model is not suited to relating
   parameter values representing lumped model characteristics with physical
   basin characteristics. The advantages of conceptual models are such that
   they can be readily applied in various physiographic regions and
   therefore constitute a valuable tool for operational hydrology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper asserts that the traditional method for reservoir routing is
   unnecessarily complicated. It requires the solution of a transcendental
   equation at each time step. Reservoir routing is actually simply the
   numerical solution of a differential equation. Any standard method can
   be used, and all are simpler than the traditional method. The paper also
   shows that the alternative form of the governing equation in terms of
   the reservoir surface elevation has some advantages over the usual form
   involving storage volume. The presentation incorporates the case where
   reservoir outflow may be varied by control of valves or spillway gates.
   Numerical methods for reservoir routing are examined and compared, and
   it is concluded that simple standard methods for solving differential
   equations are to be preferred to the traditional method for flood
   routing, and should replace it.}},

Abstract = {{An attempt has been made to provide a basis on which the amounts of

   The yield levels envisaged constitute only small proportions of the mean
   flow and the deficits arise due to seasonal fluctuations only. It is
   presumed that any deficits built up during the dry periods of the year
   are made up by the winter flows, so that there is no year to year carry
   over. The streamflow data of 26 catchments in Ireland are analysed to
   obtain the series of annual maxima storages on each catchment. Assuming
   that they are distributed according to the extreme value type 1
   distribution, the relationship between the deficit storage and its
   frequency of occurrence is calculated for various levels of yield on
   each catchment. A simple model is described which expresses this
   relationship in terms of a few parameters. For use on ungauged

   indicates that the logarithm of hydraulic conductivity is normally
   distributed. For the case considered, a simple relation between
   dispersivity and the coefficient of variation of hydraulic conductivity
   is found. One can thus determine very simply dispersivity in terms of
   the parameters of the distribution of hydraulic conductivity. This is

Abstract = {{In the southern part of the Great Hungarian Plain, chemical analyses of
   groundwater were performed during the period 1975-1989 in two water flow
   systems. Three types of temporal variations can be distinguished: a long
   term trend; a variation depending on sudden pressure decrease (both
   these types of variation can be seen in water hardness and iron
   concentration); and a regular fluctuation in COD and NH4+. The first and
   second types occurred in both flow systems and are correlated with
   pressure depletion which in turn is reflected by water level decrease in
   wells. It was supposed that water with higher hardness and higher iron
   content moves from clayey layers to sand formations because of pressure
   depletion caused by withdrawal. Regular fluctuations of COD and NH4+
   occurring only in the River Danube deposits were similar to the
   phenomenon of chemical oscillation but with different time and space
   scales between chemical and geochemical processes, the former having
   periods which are very long: 1.5 to 3.0 years.}},

Abstract = {{Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-IA Linear Imaging Self Scanning System
   (IRS-1A-LISS-I) multispectral digital data acquired over the Tawa
   reservoir region have been analysed to evaluate the turbidity in the
   surface water. Tawa reservoir water samples were collected on 20 October
   1988 concurrent with an IRS-1A overpass. The turbidity was measured at
   each sampling point in the field with a nephelometer. Reservoir water
   samples were analysed for total suspended matter, grain size and
   mineralogy. IRS-1A-LISS-I computer-compatible tapes were obtained from
   the National Remote Sensing Agency (NRSA), India. The relationship
   between the LISS-I digital data of 20 October 1988 and the measured
   values of turbidity was established. The results indicate that, in the
   turbidity range between 15-45 NTU (nephelometric turbidity units), a
   positive relationship exists between the turbidity and the visible
   wavelength band 1, 2 and 3 (0.45 to 0.68-mu-m) mean pixel values.
   Shorter wavelengths, especially in band 3 (0.62-0.68-mu-m), are more
   useful than longer wavelengths (near infrared) in quantifying turbidity.
   The concentration, mineralogy and grain size of the suspended matters
   are the main factors which influence the reflected radiance at low
   concentration levels (15-45 NTU) of turbidity. There is a positive
   correlation between reflectance, turbidity and suspended sediment
   concentration. It can be concluded that, as turbidity increases in the
   15-45 NTU range, the spectral response increases. It appears that
   IRS-1A-LISS-I data could he developed as a practical tool in water
   quality monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial variability of the factors of the universal soil loss
   equation is examined on the mediterranean basin of Conca de Tremp
   covering 43.1 km2 in Spain. The evaluation of the rainfall erosivity R
   and the soil erodibility K is relatively straightforward and
   spatially-averaged values of these parameters can be applied to the
   entire basin. Conversely, the spatial variability of annual soil erosion
   losses on large basins depends primarily on the factors L, S, and C
   describing topographic, vegetation and land use parameters. A grid size
   analysis of soil erosion losses from the Conca de Tremp basin under
   mediterranean climatic conditions in Spain shows excellent agreement
   with the earlier results on the Chaudiere basin in Canada. It is
   concluded for both basins that unbiassed estimates of soil erosion
   losses are obtained for grid sizes less than about 0.125 km2. The
   analysis of the Conca de Tremp basin validates the use of the grid size
   factor proposed by Julien \& Frenette (1987). It is also found that the
   grid size factor primarily depends on the average slope gradient which
   decreases with increasing grid size or drainage area. On the other hand,
   the grid size factor does not depend on the spatial variability of the
   factors R, K, L and C.}},

Abstract = {{Statistics of seasonal and daily rainfall in nine regions covering the
   United Kingdom are presented, together with the best currently available
   predictions of changes in rainfall and evaporation, based on various
   general circulation model (GCM) assessments of the climate 40 years
   ahead. On that basis, runoff sequences are generated for the region of
   northwest England with north Wales (NWE \& NW, humid temperate) and for
   southeast England (SEE, temperate but less humid), both for the current
   climate and for the year 2030 estimate, the latter incorporating higher
   evaporation losses. The future annual runoff is reckoned as 8\% less
   than the current average in the SEE region and 4\% less than that in the
   NWE \& NW region. Direct supply reservoir yield versus storage graphs
   are then derived in  each case for a range of duration-based probability
   of emptiness, their yields (i.e. sustained draw-off rates) and storage
   capacities being expressed as proportions of current annual runoff. The
   year 2030 graphs fall systematically below those for the current
   climate, representing 8\% to 15\% loss of yield from existing storage in
   the SEE region and 4\% to 25\% loss of yield in the NWE \& NW region.}},

Abstract = {{In many mountainous areas of the Pacific coast of North America,
   rainfall onto snowpacks causes massive floods, probably the single
   greatest cause of changes in channel morphology and lotic habitats, To
   understand and model this hydrometeorological phenomenon better,
   process-response hypotheses were developed for snowpack outflow amount,
   duration and rate and the time lags from the beginning of rainfall to
   initial and peak outflow. The hypotheses were evaluated by correlation
   and regression analyses based on measurements of 20 rain-on-snow events
   monitored between 1984 and 1990 at forested and open plots near Lake
   Tahoe, California. Outflow amount correlated significantly with
   precipitation amount, duration and rate, snow depth and melt potential.
   Many of these variables also correlated significantly with outflow
   duration and rate and lag time to peak outflow. Regression models
   explained 80-90\% of the variation in outflow amount and duration.
   Significant differences were not identified between the forest and open
   plots for any of the outflow attributes.}},

Abstract = {{A physically based model of moisture transfer in the
   soil-canopy-atmosphere system, fitted to measured data in wheat fields,
   was applied to calculate the sensitivity of evapotranspiration to the
   combined effect of possible CO2-induced climate changes and the direct
   impact of doubling CO2 content in the atmosphere. The impact of carbon
   dioxide was taken into account by changing the stomatal resistance and
   the leaf area index. Several climate change scenarios were used.
   Simulation studies showed that when the changes of a number of climatic
   and plant factors are considered, evapotranspiration responses can
   differ greatly from those that consider only temperature change. The
   temperature effect of the increase in CO2 content in the atmosphere can
   be compensated by changes in the physiological parameters of vegetation.
   Thus, under certain conditions, one can expect a decrease in
   evapotranspiration instead of an increase such as is predicted by a
   number of models which neglect the direct effects of CO2 on plant
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the use of a simple two stage rainfall-runoff model
   in which a curve number (CN) principle is used to calculate the soil
   water content and, subsequently, the rainfall contribution to direct
   runoff and groundwater flow. The maximum soil water retention, S, is
   used to express various characteristics of a catchment (infiltration
   rate, soil cover and land use, as in the CN method) relevant to flood
   formation. Using historical flood events, the model is calibrated, and
   the statistical distribution parameters of peak flows determined. With
   the same historical input data scenarios (rainfall), sets of flood
   hydrographs are simulated for various values of the parameter S, and
   corresponding distribution parameters of peak flows are determined. This
   procedure is used to demonstrate possible changes in flood regime to be
   expected due to changes of the catchment soil properties and its
   vegetation cover. A case study is presented for the River Hron
   catchment, area 582 km2, in the mountainous region of central Slovakia.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of rainfall-runoff modelling carried out on the sudanese
   savannah area in the northwest of the Ivory Coast, attempts are being
   made to reconstitute the flow at the outlets of catchments in 10 day
   time steps.  By using algorithms with automatic fitting procedures for
   the parameters, it appeared necessary to make a choice concerning the
   calibration objective functions to be used.  The paper presents the
   algorithms, data and objective functions that have been used.  The
   results obtained from the calibrations made have been analysed.  That
   analysis was done principally with the help of a comparative evaluation
   modulus which takes into account elements other than the value of the
   objective function alone and which enables the quality of the results to
   be picked out from a hydrological point of view.  At the conclusion of
   the analysis, the objective function defined by Nash seems to stand out
   quite clearly in relation to the other formulae examined.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays it is well recognized that inference about the form of the

   regional estimation of parameters of the generalized extreme value (GEV)
   distribution for 1 day annual maximum precipitation amounts in The
   Netherlands.  The adequacy of regional models can be tested in several
   ways.  Special attention is paid to the number of exceedances of

Abstract = {{The sensitivity of some critical water management issues, such as
   reservoir storage and hydroelectric production, to climatic variability
   and change on a regional basis is analysed and presented.  This is the
   second of two papers presented in this issue dealing with the regional
   hydrological effects of climatic change.  By using a set of plausible
   hypothetical climatic scenarios to represent both greenhouse warming and
   precipitation changes, the sensitivity of the guaranteed annual fresh
   water and energy supply levels has been evaluated under conditions of
   altered runoff for four connected multi-purpose reservoirs in central
   Greece.  It is shown that reservoirs designed and operated under current
   climatic conditions are, in general, affected by the climatic changes
   examined.  A dramatic increase of the risk associated with the annual
   guaranteed quantity of water supply and energy production would occur if
   greenhouse warming were accompanied by a reduction in annual
   precipitation.  Significant increases of storage volume would then be
   needed to maintain existing water and energy yields at tolerable risk
   levels.}},

Abstract = {{A new procedure, the method of lower-bound (MLB), is proposed for
   determining the design quantile Xp.  The basic concept is first to
   determine an estimate a triple-overdot 0 of the location parameter a0
   using the probability weighted moment (PWM) method, and then to
   transform the variable X from the original (X) space to a new (Y) space
   by using Y = X - a triple-overdot 0.  The variable Y is considered to
   have a two parameter gamma distribution.  In Y-space, the two parameters
   are estimated by the PWM or an autocovariance method, then transformed
   from the Y-space to the X-space.  Results from the Monte Carlo
   experiments show that the MLB estimates are less biassed than comparable
   moment estimates and maximum likelihood estimates, and more efficient
   than those of PWM for design quantiles Xp.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation and discharge have been measured for several years in two

   Actual evapotranspiration has been calculated as the difference between
   annual precipitation and discharge.  Results show that:  (a) most of the
   precipitation is evaporated rather than lost by streamflow, even in the
   most humid years; (b) there is a high inter-annual variability both in
   discharge and evapotranspiration; and (c) annual evapotranspiration
   correlates significantly with annual precipitation, in contrast to the
   constancy of annual evaporation in catchments of wet, colder climates. 
   Finally, a simple expression is proposed in order to calculate annual
   actual evaporation from the ratio of precipitation to potential
   evapotranspiration.  This expression uses a derived exponent, k, which
   takes into account the characteristics of individual catchments.}},

   model scenario, the temperature increase in Finland will be
   2-6-degrees-C, the precipitation increase 10-30 mm per month and the
   evaporation increase 5-30 mm per month.  The effects of these climatic
   changes on runoff and snow cover have been evaluated in twelve different
   watersheds by hydrological watershed models.  According to the results
   the mean discharge (MQ) increases by 20-50\%, the mean minimum
   discharges (MNQ) increase considerably in winter due to a two to three
   months shorter snow cover period and the mean maximum discharges (MHQ)
   decrease due to diminished maximum snow water equivalents.  In southern
   Finland persistent winter snow cover will vanish.}},

   knowledge base has been constructed using degrees of certainty and other
   factors. The model has been applied to a region in Southern Italy, where
   data are available. The first results are encouraging and further

Abstract = {{Water management under drought conditions is a challenging task to
   irrigation and agricultural engineers.  The parameters of interest in
   identifying drought include onset, termination and severity.  In this
   paper, a methodology to identify those parameters from the available
   historic data on streamflow and rainfall having seasonal pattern is
   proposed.  The methodology follows and modifies a procedure by Herbst et
   al. (1966) suggested for the analysis of drought.  This modified
   methodology is applied to the streamflow series of the Bhadra river and
   the mean areal rainfall series for the catchment of the Bhadra reservoir
   in Karnataka State, India.  The droughts identified by the proposed
   methodology are concurrent with the historically realized droughts, thus
   proving the viability and applicability of the methodology in the
   identification of drought conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Rainfall catches from three standard MKII Meteorological Office gauges
   are examined. These gauges differ in that one is exposed, one is
   surrounded by a turf wall and the third is mounted at ground level.
   Rainfall records between 1976 and 1988 are analysed to assess the
   variations in rainfall catch between the three types of gauge. During
   the early period of study, differences between gauges exceeded those in
   later years and this has been attributed to the settling-in of the new
   turf wall and ground level collector surfaces. After this initial period
   the annual differences in catch relative to the standard exposed gauge
   are 2\% and 5\% for the turf wall and ground level gauges respectively.
   Regression analysis has produced correction equations which can convert
   standard exposed gauge data to either turf wall or ground level
   equivalents. The equation for ground level/exposed gauges is found to be
   very similar to one developed in Nigeria and has been found to be
   applicable to water balance studies elsewhere.}},

Abstract = {{A new method of evaluation of the response of a water table to
   artificial recharge is presented.  The solution is formulated in the
   form of a simple numerical model.  The model has several advantages over
   the traditional methods of mounding prediction.  The effect of the
   unsaturated zone, which modifies the recharge rate as compared with the
   infiltration rate, is considered.  Mounding is calculated for a variable
   recharge rate induced by a variable infiltration rate.  Also, the effect
   of in-transit water in reducing the fillable pore space above a rising
   water table is considered.  The validity of the model results is
   illustrated using several sets of field data collected in the Ghazvin
   Plain (Iran).  Sample calculations proved that the model predicts
   mounding more accurately than the traditional methods and, therefore,
   more realistic recommendations for the design and operation of
   artificial recharge schemes are possible using the model.}},
