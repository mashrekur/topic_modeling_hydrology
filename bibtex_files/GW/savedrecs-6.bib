Abstract = {{The occurrence of saline waters in the Baltic Shield in Sweden is
   consistent with ongoing but incomplete Holocene flushing and depends on
   the geometry and connectivity of conductive structures at both regional
   and local scales, and on the surface topography. Numerical simulation of
   regional variable-density fluid flow during Holocene land-rise and
   coastal regression shows that the existence of any old saline water,
   whether derived from submarine recharge in regions below Sweden's
   highest postglacial coastline or geochemical processes in the
   crystalline rock, is an indication either of slow fluid movements
   through the bedrock over long times, or of long travel distances through
   fracture systems before arriving at measurement points. During the
   land-rise period, regional flow is not affected by the variable density
   of fluids in the upper few kilometers of the shield, and the topography
   of the water table is the only driving force. The spatial distribution
   of meteoric flushing water and pre-Holocene waters may be complex, with
   the possibility of relatively fresh water in fracture zones below salty
   units even at depths of a few kilometers. The domination of the
   topographic driving force implies that deep saline water is not
   necessarily stagnant, and significant flow may be expected to occur in
   well-connected horizons even at depth. Local topography variation and
   fracture zone location combine to create a complex flow field in which
   local topographic driving forces extend to considerable depth in some
   areas, whereas regional topographic forces predominate in others. Thus,
   a pattern may be difficult to discern in measurements of the regional
   salinity distribution, although it is clear that the coastal region is
   the major zone of discharge for deeper pre-Holocene fluids. During the
   land-rise period, the regional flow field equilibrates with changing
   climatic conditions and coastal positions, while the distribution of
   flushing water and older water lags and will perpetually change between
   successive glaciations. These characteristics have direct implications
   for the safety of nuclear water repositories located at depth in Baltic
   Shield rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical models of solute transport in water-saturated porous media are
   routinely used to make regulatory and design decisions. For many
   contaminants, decisions are based on concentrations of 5 parts per
   billion (ppb) or less. This `'action level' is usually a small fraction
   (<0.01) of the concentrations near a source of contamination. Two
   one-dimensional example problems are used to demonstrate that modeling
   errors using classical numerical methods are largest where
   concentrations are lowest. This implies that in regions of low
   dimensionless concentration, that is near the action level, large
   relative errors can be expected. Hence, decisions based on numerical
   model solutions at low concentrations must be taken cautiously. Modern
   numerical methods for the solution of transport equations provide better
   behavior, in this sense, than classical methods.}},

Abstract = {{A general semianalytical method for modeling the advective transport of
   a volatile organic compound (VOC) to a soil vapor extraction well has
   been developed. Assuming that the VOC is not present in the form of a
   nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL), this technique is applicable to cases in
   which the VOC is partitioned in the unsaturated zone between the gas,
   aqueous, and solid phases. The VOC may have a one-, two-, or
   three-dimensional initial distribution. The method may be applied to
   problems having a one- or two-dimensional steady-state gas flow field in
   which the gas streamfunction and gas travel time distributions are
   known. Examples are included to show the application of the method to
   radial and two-dimensional cylindrical gas flow fields with different
   VOC distributions and characteristics.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{708-718}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{The extensive lacustrine Chalco Plain in the southeastern part of Mexico
   City is underlain by an aquitard up to 300 m thick composed of a layered
   sequence of very porous (80-90\%) fine-grained, organic-rich Quaternary
   deposits, with thin horizontal interbeds of volcanic sand (''Capas
   Duras''). The aquitard overlies a thick sequence of alluvial-pyroclastic
   sediments which form a highly productive regional aquifer. The Chalco
   Plain was a shallow lake until the 1940s when it was drained for
   agricultural use and human habitation. Historic information indicates
   that the Chalco Plain was an area of ground-water discharge prior to the
   onset of heavy ground-water extraction from the semiconfined aquifer.
   Due to aquifer pumping, however, the hydraulic gradient has reversed
   throughout the full thickness of the aquitard in areas where the
   aquitard is thin (< 100 m), and recharging conditions now prevail. Where
   the aquitard is thick, the hydraulic head data show a progressive
   decline with time even though the hydraulic gradient still indicates
   upward flow in at least the upper part of the lacustrine sequence.
   Between the early 1960s, when major ground-water extraction began beyond
   the periphery of the aquitard, and the onset in 1982 of heavy pumping
   from aquifers beneath the aquitard, the land surface subsided
   approximately 3 m. An additional subsidence of 2 m occurred between 1984
   and 1989, causing a shallow lake to form and gradually expand. If the
   present rate of ground-water withdrawal from the Chalco Basin continues,
   total land subsidence in the middle of the plain will probably continue
   to a rate of about 0.4 m per year for many years, and could eventually
   reach a total subsidence of tens of meters in the thickest part of the
   Chalco Plain. Pore water in much of the aquitard is saline; however,
   release of salts and other chemical constituents to the underlying
   aquifer has not yet significantly impaired the aquifer water quality. A
   better understanding of the behavior of the aquitard under the influence
   of aquifer pumping is needed to assist in long-term management of ground
   water and land use in the Chalco Plain.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{719-724}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a volatile, nontoxic, inorganic compound,
   behaved identically to bromide in a laboratory column tracer experiment
   with saturated sandy media. A simple system was used to achieve an SF6
   injection concentration of approximately 7 mg/l, roughly 25\% of its
   solubility. While this system requires more equipment and time than that
   involved in preparing ionic tracer solutions, certain benefits are
   realized. The detection limit for SF6 Was approximately 5 mug/l using a
   simple headspace extraction technique and a gas chromatograph with an
   electron capture detector. Thus, the tracer could be followed for a
   three order of magnitude decrease in concentration. For similar
   resolution, bromide had to be injected at a concentration over 1000 mg/l
   (typical detection limit approximately 0.5 mg/l). When the required
   higher concentrations of the ionic tracers may lead to significant
   geochemical changes or density effects, SF6 may be the preferable
   tracer. Furthermore, unlike ionic tracers, the highly volatile SF6 may
   be readily removed from water. High volatility does, however, require
   that some care be taken to limit the potential loss of mass during
   injection, sampling, and analysis. Since others are developing
   procedures for analyzing SF6 in ground water with extremely low
   detection limits (on the order of 1 ng/l), it appears likely that
   measurable concentrations could range over six to seven orders of
   magnitude. This range is considerably wider than typically possible with
   ionic tracers, and may offer an important advantage in some
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty is associated with interpretation of the subsurface, and
   stochastic simulation techniques are incapable of accounting for all the
   uncertainty if only a single deterministic semivariogram model is
   utilized. Jackknifing the data bounds the limits of model semivariograms
   but typically indicates that a large number of simulations must be
   conducted to consider the full distribution of possible semivariograms.
   Latin-hypercube sampling, particularly when combined with expert
   opinion, reduces the number of simulations that must be created and
   evaluated. For small data sets, where there is significant uncertainty,
   this process provides for a more complete assessment of the potential
   variability of the subsurface and of flow paths for contaminants, given
   the available data. Such assessment can be used to guide the data
   collection program and the decision-making process.}},

Abstract = {{A diffusive sampler was developed to provide a passive in situ method
   for long-term monitoring of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the
   ground water at hazardous waste sites and waste disposal facilities. The
   sampler was constructed of a sorbent tube that fits inside a specially
   designed sampling chamber equipped with a diffusional membrane that is
   not permeable to water but has a high permeability rate for organic
   vapors. VOCs in the ground water, having relatively high Henry's Law
   constants, enter the chamber by molecular diffusion and are collected by
   the sorbent. After a predetermined exposure period, the sorbent is
   easily retrieved for laboratory analyses by gas chromatography/mass
   spectrometry (GC/MS), or qualitative concentrations can be determined in
   the field directly using specific-indicator detectors in place of the
   sorbent. The measurement approach was evaluated in the laboratory by
   exposing the device to a solution of 22.5 mug/l o-xylene before testing
   at a field site where the ground water was contaminated by
   trichlorethylene (TCE). Results of the laboratory and field studies
   indicate the sampling approach is viable for monitoring relatively low
   concentrations of VOCs over a one-day sampling period, as well as
   providing longer monitoring periods up to 51 days.}},

Abstract = {{China's first sea-water intrusion observation network is in the Laizhou
   Bay region. The data obtained for four consecutive years are presented.
   There is usually a wide transition zone in the study area, but in some
   regions, a relatively distinct and sharp interface is formed. A detailed
   analysis has shown that there are at least two types of
   salt-water/fresh-water interface. The interface in the study area had
   moved about 140 m along the main observed section in a period of three
   years and three months due to the effect of pumping wells. Salt water
   may invade via the riverbed deposits but usually changes its invading
   direction due to the united effect of the pumping wells. Sea-water
   intrusion was caused by the excessive pumping of ground water from the
   coastal aquifer. The interface was generally formed on the inland side
   not far away from the powerful discharge pumping center, and sea-water
   intrusion stops there. The monitoring data suggested that if the
   powerful discharge pumping center moves landward, salt water will start
   advancing landward until a new equilibrium is reached, and even if a new
   pumping well, whose discharge is very small, is drilled, the equilibrium
   would be upset, thus causing the interface to advance inland slowly.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term exposure assessments regarding four commonly used pesticides
   are presented in this paper. Alachlor, aldicarb, lindane, and parathion
   have been detected in ground-water monitoring wells. A multimedia
   transport model is employed to predict the long-term fate of these
   chemicals in the environment. Concentrations in each environmental
   compartment are calculated and used to determine the dominant exposure
   pathways and hence dose rate.
   Aldicarb is shown to move from the upper soil compartment, through the
   lower soil compartment, and accumulate at a rate which is several orders
   of magnitude greater than the other pesticides. Lindane moves faster to
   the biota compartment than the other pesticides. The dominant exposure
   pathway for aldicarb and alachlor is drinking water ingestion for both
   adults and children. For lindane and parathion, the dominant exposure
   pathway is biota ingestion for children and fish ingestion for adults.
   The methods presented in this paper can be used as screening tools for
   designing remediation, mitigation, or interdiction measures and can
   serve as a basis for evaluating risk management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a field experiment involving the release of 230.9
   liters of tetrachloroethylene (PCE) below the water table in a naturally
   occurring, unconfined sand aquifer. The release was executed in a 3 m X
   3 m X 3.4 m deep, sealable-joint steel sheet-pile cell anchored into an
   underlying clay aquitard. After allowing 28 days for redistribution,
   excavation of the upper approximately 0.9 m of the cell revealed PCE
   pools and residual to be present in relatively coarser grained horizons,
   with substantial degrees of lateral flow having taken place. This
   lateral flow was observed in laminations and lenses ranging in thickness
   from a few mm to a few cm, with only subtle variations in texture
   separating individual migration pathways. Detailed sampling during the
   excavation procedure and subsampling of three cores extended down to the
   clay aquitard revealed a spatially variable distribution of PCE with
   saturations ranging from 1\% to 38\% of pore space. Laboratory
   measurement of a fully hysteretic capillary pressure curve demonstrated
   that the degree of nonwetting phase residual is a function of the
   maximum saturation attained along main drainage during the initial
   infiltration process. Various models for consolidated petroleum
   reservoir materials did not fit the experimental data well. The theory
   governing pool formation in heterogeneous porous media is also
   presented, and it is demonstrated that pools can form in homogeneous
   media exhibiting a distinct entry pressure.}},

   Ivan karst spring. The underground watershed has been determined by
   geological and hydrogeological methods. The control used was the
   hydrologic water budget analysis appropriate for karst basins with
   limited data (Turc, 1954). The Sv. Ivan spring includes one main spring
   and several intermittent springs. The water in the main spring
   penetrates the flysch layers which limit the spring's discharge;
   therefore, the discharge of the main spring is fairly uniform. The ratio
   between minimum and maximum yearly discharges ranges from 1:3.3 to
   1:12.8. Only a part of the water flows through the main spring while the
   other springs in the zone are overflows. The catchment area of Sv. Ivan

Abstract = {{We examine flow in an unconfined aquifer near a recirculation well,
   which consists of a source and a sink of equal discharge, with emphasis
   on understanding the behavior of the free surface. The well is vertical
   with a pump located between an inlet above and an outlet below to induce
   recirculation of ground water and thus enhance mixing. The boundary
   element method is used to model the flow with the free-surface boundary
   condition. Numerical simulations show that for this arrangement there is
   a critical pumping rate beyond which the free surface becomes unstable
   and is drawn down to the well. The value of this critical rate as well
   as the maximum drawdown of the phreatic surface were determined for a
   range of well-screen (inlet and outlet) separations. In addition to the
   numerical model, we developed an analytical approximation that yielded
   an estimate of the critical pumping rate. The analytical estimate is
   shown to be in reasonably good agreement with the numerical results. We
   also examined the effect of approximating the free-surface boundary by a
   horizontal confining layer. The radius of influence of a single well
   source-sink pair was only slightly affected by making this
   approximation, as long as the pumping rate remained below the critical
   value.}},

Abstract = {{Model porous media made from glass beads and matched refractive index
   liquids have made it possible to visualize displacement processes in
   heterogeneous porous media and to obtain in situ concentration profiles
   to validate flow codes. However, glass beads produce porous media that
   are translucent rather than transparent. Thus, these models cannot be
   used to observe 3-D effects. Furthermore, the current necessity of using
   relatively large glass beads results in permeabilities that are several
   orders of magnitude larger than natural porous media. This paper
   describes a new approach for making transparent porous media by
   consolidating suspensions of amorphous silica in matched refractive
   index liquids. The resulting porous media can be made to have porosities
   and permeabilities comparable to a very wide range of soils and
   reservoir materials by the appropriate choice of particle size and/or
   consolidation pressure. Because these porous media are truly transparent
   and not merely translucent, relatively simple optical techniques can be
   used to map variations in porosity and to measure 3-D flow processes.}},

Abstract = {{Phase diagrams can be used to optimize the composition of surfactant
   solutions (cosurfactant/surfactant) designed for the recovery of DNAPLs
   at residual saturation in aquifer formations. The study also shows that
   the combination of cosurfactant (alcohol) and surfactant is more
   effective than the use of alcohols or surfactants separately. The
   suggested approach is based on miscible oil displacement using
   surfactant solutions at high concentrations. Most of the recent projects
   using surfactants for aquifer cleanup use low-concentration solutions
   that promote immiscible oil displacement. The goal of the present study
   is to demonstrate the potential of optimized surfactant solutions to
   restore oil and DNAPL-contaminated sites such as the one in Ville
   Mercier, Quebec (site contaminated with a mixture of petroleum and
   chlorinated solvents). The results show that alcohol/surfactant systems
   can be used to solubilize chlorinated solvents (TCE, PCE) and light oils
   (gasoline, diesel). For the dissolution of heavy and viscous oils (motor
   oil, ATF, creosote, Ville Mercier oil), an organic solvent must be added
   to the alcohol/surfactant system.}},

Abstract = {{Factors that affect the mass of chemical constituents entering a well
   include the distributions of flow rate and chemical concentrations along
   and near the screened or open section of the well. Assuming a layered
   porous medium (with each layer being characterized by a uniform
   hydraulic conductivity and chemical concentration), a knowledge of the
   flow from each layer along the screened zone and of the chemical
   concentrations in each layer enables the total mass entering the well to
   be determined. Analyses of hypothetical systems and a site at Galloway,
   NJ, provide insight into the temporal variation of water-quality data
   observed when withdrawing water from screened wells in heterogeneous
   ground-water systems.
   The analyses of hypothetical systems quantitatively indicate the
   cause-and-effect relations that cause temporal variability in water
   samples obtained from wells. Chemical constituents that have relatively
   uniform concentrations with depth may not show variations in
   concentrations in the water discharged from a well after the well is
   purged (evacuation of standing water in the well casing). However,
   chemical constituents that do not have uniform concentrations near the
   screened interval of the well may show variations in concentrations in
   the well discharge water after purging because of the physics of
   ground-water flow in the vicinity of the screen.
   Water-quality samples were obtained through time over a 30 minute period
   from a site at Galloway, NJ. The water samples were analyzed for
   aromatic hydrocarbons, and the data for benzene, toluene, and meta +
   para xylene were evaluated for temporal variations. Samples were taken
   from seven discrete zones, and the flow-weighted concentrations of
   benzene, toluene, and meta + para xylene all indicate an increase in
   concentration over time during pumping. These observed trends in time
   were reproduced numerically based on the estimated concentration
   distribution in the aquifer and the flow rates from each zone.
   The results of the hypothetical numerical experiments and the analysis
   of the field data both corroborate the impact of physical and chemical
   heterogeneity in the aquifer on water-quality samples obtained from
   wells. If temporal variations in concentrations of chemical constituents
   are observed, they may indicate variability in the ground-water system
   being sampled, which may give insight into the chemical distributions
   within the aquifer and provide guidance in the positioning of new
   sampling devices or wells.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrologic test analysis based on the derivative of pressure (i.e., rate
   of pressure change) with respect to the natural logarithm of time has
   been shown to significantly improve the diagnostic and quantitative
   analysis of slug and constant-rate pumping tests. The improvement in
   test analysis is attributed to the sensitivity of the derivative to
   small variations in the pressure change that occurs during testing,
   which would otherwise be less obvious with standard pressure change
   versus time analysis. The sensitivity of the pressure derivative to
   pressure change facilitates its use in identifying the effects of
   wellbore storage, boundaries, and establishment of radial flow
   conditions on the test.
   DERIV is a program for converting slug and pumping test data and
   associated type curves to derivative format. The program has features
   that permit the smoothing of noisy test data, accounts for pressure
   derivative end-effects, and can be used to convert slug test data to
   equivalent pumping test responses. Test examples that demonstrate the
   use of pressure derivatives also are provided.}},

Abstract = {{Evolving environmental regulations have increased the need for defining
   the protective properties of geologic layers. Of particular significance
   is the need for defining vertical times-of-travel (TOT) through
   aquitards located above municipal water supply wellfields. Surface
   geoelectrics provide an inexpensive field measurement method that can be
   used to quantitatively define protective properties. Protective layer
   longitudinal unit conductance squared (S2) can be theoretically related
   to TOT using material relationships between resistivity and hydraulic
   conductivity divided by porosity (K/n).
   In an example presented for a municipal wellfield, it was possible to
   utilize a limited number of geoelectric soundings to establish
   relationships between S of a conductive protective layer and apparent
   resistivities measured at individual electrode spacings, providing a
   method to estimate S with profiling. In this case, longitudinal unit
   conductance (S) was the geoelectrically equivalent parameter of the
   protective layer. The use of combined sounding and profiling data in the
   wellfield area resulted in an overall reduction in the kriging
   estimation error of S for the protective clay layer and a larger area of
   coverage over what was obtained with soundings alone.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model and calculation method were developed for
   steady-state flow in a confined aquifer-vertical well system without the
   usual assumption that the specific discharge in the radial direction to
   the screen is constant along its axis.
   A vertical mell is represented as a linear sink located along the well
   axis with nonuniform inflow (specific discharges) for description of a
   flow in an aquifer. Flow in the screen channels is described by taking
   into account energy losses and the momentum flux change along the well
   screen's axial (vertical) orifice. Substantial errors are avoided by the
   use of the proposed model in calculations of drawdown-well discharge
   function and maximum specific discharge to the screen which influences
   sand pumping, incrustation, and corrosion processes.}},

Abstract = {{This study describes the distribution of organic pollutants from the
   ground surface, through the unsaturated zone, to the water table at a
   citrus grove irrigated by sewage effluent for about 20 years. The citrus
   grove, located in Israel, overlies an unconfined Coastal Plain aquifer
   about 2 km inland from the Mediterranean Sea. The distribution of
   organic compounds at the citrus grove is compared with two control sites
   receiving moisture from nonpolluted water sources (one in another citrus
   grove irrigated by ground water and the other in an uncultivated area
   receiving only precipitation). Overall, 10 analyses were performed. At
   the effluent-irrigated site, organic pollutants from the sewage had
   migrated through the 20 meter thick unsaturated zone to the water table;
   included in these were several pollutants, such as toluene and
   phthalates, that are considered to be biodegradable. Pollutant
   concentrations generally increased with depth. On the other hand,
   pollutant concentrations at the two control sites decreased
   significantly with depth through the unsaturated zone. The downward
   mobility of organic pollutants may be enhanced by the sewage itself.
   Because sewage effluent is considered to be a readily available source
   of irrigation water in many parts of the world, the results of this
   study suggest that what may seem to be a relatively simple solution to
   water scarcity problems may have potentially long-term and dangerous
   effects on ground-water quality.}},

Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Dissolution of carbonate minerals in the coastal halocline is taking
   place in the karst terrain along the northeastern coast of the Yucatan
   Peninsula. The dissolution is being accelerated in cenotes (sinkholes)
   where sulfate reduction and oxidation of the produced sulfide is
   occurring.
   Hydrogen-sulfide concentrations ranged from 0.06 to 4 mmolal within the
   halocline in two sinkholes. Relative to concentrations expected by
   conservative mixing, fluids with high hydrogen-sulfide concentrations
   were correlated with low sulfate concentrations, high alkalinities, low
   pH values, and heavy sulfur isotope values for sulfate. Hydrogen-sulfide
   concentrations were less than those predicted from sulfate reduction,
   calculated from deficiencies in measured sulfate concentrations,
   indicating mobility and loss of aqueous sulfide.
   Fluids with low hydrogen-sulfide concentrations were correlated with
   very high calcium concentrations, high strontium and sulfate
   concentrations, slightly elevated alkalinities, low pH values, and
   sea-water sulfur isotope values for sulfate. Gypsum dissolution is
   supported by the sulfur isotopes as the major process producing high
   sulfate concentrations. However, oxidation of aqueous sulfide to
   sulfuric acid, resulting in carbonate-mineral dissolution is needed to
   explain the calcium concentrations, low pH values, and only slightly
   elevated alkalinities.
   The halocline may trap hydrogen sulfide that has been stripped from the
   underlying anoxic salt water. The halocline can act as a stable,
   physical boundary, holding some of the hydrogen sulfide until it is
   oxidized back to sulfuric acid through interaction with the overlying,
   oxygenated fresh water or through the activity of sulfide-oxidizing
   bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Multilevel, double-packer slug tests were performed in open core holes
   to characterize heterogeneity within a flat-lying, fractured carbonate
   aquifer. Hydraulic conductivity was measured to vary by approximately
   three orders of magnitude in the vertical direction and by as much as
   two orders of magnitude in the horizontal direction. In general,
   hydraulic conductivity decreased with distance from the bedrock
   free-surface, as the degree of fracturing decreased. The results of the
   multilevel slug tests provided the basis for hydraulic conductivity
   zonation within a two-dimensional finite-element model, which simulated
   nitrate transport in cross section. In simulation of steady-state flow,
   several shallow, local ground-water flow systems occurred with exit
   points that are consistent with springs observable in the field. Yearly
   rotating crops of corn and soybeans were simulated with nitrate source
   concentrations based on pore water measurements in the lower soil zones
   of the field site. The majority of simulated nitrate movement occurred
   within shallow, localized ground-water flow systems, where much of the
   nitrate exited the system relatively soon after entering, without
   appreciable accumulation of nitrate through the years. Based on these
   results, a monitoring program with a relatively high spatial and
   temporal resolution in the shallow, localized ground-water flow systems
   was required in order to characterize nitrate concentrations in the
   ground water. Regional water quality surveys that involve a random
   sampling of existing, widely spaced wells would likely miss detecting
   the locations and times of high nitrate concentrations in ground water.}},

Abstract = {{Recovery analysis from pumping tests with varying discharge is
   well-documented but in practice often wrongly considered to be
   impractical or even impossible. However, the Theis recovery method for
   constant rate tests is popular and widely used to determine aquifer
   transmissivity. The purpose of this paper is to review and promote
   determination of transmissivity by recovery analysis in tests in which
   the discharge is not steady but represented by a step function. The
   equations for a stepped discharge recovery method are presented in a
   simple form, highlighting the fact that it is a direct extension of the
   Theis recovery method with the same advantages and ease of application.
   It is demonstrated that the Theis recovery method cannot generally be
   used with an average discharge for varying rate tests. Recovery analysis
   should always be approached with the stepped discharge recovery method,
   which reduces to the Theis method if the discharge is constant. The
   stepped discharge recovery method is particularly useful for step tests
   and for analyzing data from the pumped well, and it should be standard
   practice to monitor the recovery in all pumping tests on single wells.
   It is also shown that a different storage coefficient during recovery
   than during pumping does not result in a shifted straight line in the
   recovery analysis but in a curve passing through the origin.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{The field screening of soil gas CO2 and O2 using portable instruments is
   shown to be useful for indirectly detecting and delineating subsurface
   gasoline contamination. Shallow ( < 50 cm) soil gas surveys performed at
   a site of subsurface gasoline contamination in Connecticut indicated a
   good correlation between elevated CO2, depleted O2, and total
   hydrocarbon vapor anomalies. CO2 and O2 anomalies were also found to be
   spatially coincident with the area of known subsurface gasoline leakage.
   Soil gas CO2 levels ranged from 0.2 to 18.7 volume percent, whereas O2
   levels ranged from 20.8 to 0.5 volume percent. The gases exhibited a
   nearly constant inverse correlation except near the source of
   contamination. In this area, CO2 generation from anaerobic degradation
   of hydrocarbons likely caused a decrease in the observed CO2 and O2
   correlation. This suggests that the ratio of soil gas CO2 to O2 may be
   useful to delineate aerobic and anaerobic degradation zones, the latter
   being in the vicinity of highly contaminated areas. Periodic sampling of
   seven permanent soil gas probes over a 17-month period indicated
   significant seasonal variations in CO2 and O2. When the soil was warmest
   during the summer, the CO2 reached a maximUM and O2 reached a minimum.
   The opposite was observed during the winter when the soil achieved its
   minimum temperature. These observations most likely reflect changes in
   microbial acitivity in response to subsurface temperature variations.
   Further, hydrocarbon vapor levels were observed to decrease by several
   orders of magnitude to nondetectable levels during the winter months.
   Although CO2 and O2 anomalies were also diminished during the winter
   months, they were still readily detectable. These observations indicate
   that soil gas surveying for subsurface gasoline leakage may be enhanced
   by monitoring CO2 and O2.}},

Abstract = {{Batch and column sorption/desorption experiments were conducted to
   quantify the retardation of tritium and cesium in brine-saturated
   mudstone, halite, and carbonate rocks from Palo Duro Basin, Texas, one
   of the three sites originally nominated by the U.S. Department of Energy
   for construction of a civilian nuclear waste repository. Retardation
   factors (R) were determined using six different methods, including batch
   sorption equilibrium, fitting of two transport models, breakthrough area
   integration, and pore volume displacement at C/C0 = 0.5, for both the
   sorption and desorption parts of the breakthrough curves. The
   breakthrough area integration method resulted in R values consistently
   lower than the other methods, which were in reasonable agreement. The
   data indicated very small retardation for cesium in all the media,
   except mudstone, which exhibited moderate retardation (R < 3.5). It was
   shown that the small extent of cesium retardation was most possibly
   caused by the strong competition for sorption sites of the components of
   the saturated brine, which were several orders of magnitude higher in
   concentration than cesium. Tritium breakthrough curves for all media
   tested were accurately simulated by the local equilibrium
   advection-dispersion model (model I). With the exception of mudstone,
   cesium breakthrough curves were also adequately simulated by model I.
   The cesium breakthrough curve for mudstone exhibited considerable
   tailing on the desorption side of the curve, which was best described by
   the two-site kinetic sorption model II. This was attributed to chemical
   nonequilibrium (two types of sorption sites). Predicted breakthrough
   curves for cesium using model I were in good to reasonable agreement
   with measured breakthrough curves.}},

   extraction pilot study was conducted in a test area containing an
   estimated 1780 kg of paint thinner. The site was instrumented with vapor
   extraction wells and numerous soil vapor and pressure monitoring wells
   to delineate the zone of reduced pressure and sample the soil gases
   within the test site. Monitoring for eight months indicated that the

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{627-633}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for quantifying the volume of porous
   medium investigated during a slug test in an unbounded porous medium, in
   the presence of a linear constant-head or no-flow boundary, and in the
   presence of a radial no-flow boundary. For the unbounded case, type
   curves are generated for different values of the wellbore storage
   coefficient, which relate the distance travelled by a given pressure
   perturbation (1, 5, and 10\% of the initial drawdown in the well), to
   dimensionless time. This distance is found to increase linearly on a
   log-log plot until it reaches a maximum which is a function of the
   wellbore storage coefficient. The appropriate choice of dimensionless
   groups allows the different curves for each level of perturbation to be
   collapsed into one curve. Functional relationships offer an alternative
   to using the type curves graphically. For bounded systems, type curves
   relate the distance to the boundary to the time of 1 and 5\% deviation
   from the unbounded response. Although these curves cannot be collapsed,
   the presented range of wellbore storage coefficients covers most
   practical situations. Developed relationships allow the estimation of
   the maximum distance travelled by the pressure perturbations in the
   unbounded case, and the maximum distance at which a linear constant-head
   or no-flow boundary, or a radial no-flow boundary, still produces a
   given deviation in the pressure response measured at the well. An
   application shows that substantial error may result if the distance to a
   boundary is evaluated while neglecting storage in the well. Finally,
   application of the methodology developed for a linear no-flow boundary
   to a real data set yields a realistic distance to the boundary and a far
   better match between simulated and measured data than if an unbounded
   system is considered. The type curves and relationships presented here
   should be applicable to slug test design and analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional numerical model is developed for the simulation of
   water flow and chemical transport through variably saturated porous
   media. The nonlinear flow equation is solved using the Galerkin
   finite-element technique with either the Picard or the Newton iteration
   scheme. A continuous velocity field is obtained by separate application
   of the Galerkin technique to the Darcy's equation. A two-site
   adsorption-desorption model with a first-order loss term is used to
   describe the chemical behavior of the reactive solute. The advective
   part of the transport equation is solved with one-step backward particle
   tracking while the dispersive part is solved by the regular Galerkin
   finite-element technique. A preconditioned conjugate gradient-like
   method is used for the iterative solution of the systems of linear
   simultaneous equations to save on computer memory and execution time.
   The model is applied to a few flow and transport problems, and the
   numerical results are compared with observed and analytic values. The
   model is found to duplicate the analytic and observed values quite well,
   even near very sharp fronts.}},

Abstract = {{Data on 13 median leachate qualities at 56 landfills show a multivariate
   character. A simulation technique is used to include this multivariate
   character of leachate quality in assessing false negative error rates
   for statistical tests of ground-water quality. Although the technique
   makes gross simplifying assumptions regarding the conservative mixing of
   leachate and ground water, the technique is more appropriate than
   traditional statistical methods for simulating false negative error
   rates that neglect correlations among water quality parameters. The
   technique is applied to the simple case of a control chart, intrawell
   statistical test of ground-water contamination. Simulation results show
   that both the false positive and false negative errors of statistical
   tests can be reduced when tests include more parameters and a higher
   confidence level; thus, the technique can provide a `'win-win''
   situation for regulators and the regulated.}},

   PLUMES OF VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS (VOCS)}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be stripped from ground water by
   sparging air into water in wells or in trenches. This well/trench
   sparging (''WTS'') can remove VOCs from plumes of contaminated ground
   water as that water passes across the sparge zone. With sparging in
   wells, cutoff walls will be needed to force the contaminated water
   through the `'gate'' wells. With in situ sparging (''ISS''), air is
   sparged directly into a contaminated aquifer. ISS may be useful in
   treating local zones of high contamination, but WTS is better suited for
   treating large plumes of contaminated ground water. Interest in sparging
   methods is growing because: (1) they do not remove water from the
   subsurface, and so difficult disposal issues are avoided and an
   increasingly valuable water resource is not depleted; and (2) the Darcy
   velocity v in many systems is low, and so only a relatively small volume
   of water must be treated per unit time.
   The theoretical fractional efficiency of WTS is given by E = S/(1 + S).
   The parameter S is named here as the `'dimensionless sparge
   number,''with S = HR(g)/(RTyzv) where H (atm-m3/mol) = Henry's Law
   constant for the compound of interest; R(g) (m3/s, at 1 atm pressure) =
   gas sparging rate; R = gas constant (= 8.2 X 10(-5) m3-atm/mol-deg); T =
   temperature (K); yz (m2) = cross-sectional area producing the water
   which is passing into the sparging zone; and v = Darcy velocity (m/s). E
   increases as S increases. E increases as H increases because the
   volatility of a compound goes up as its H increases. Plots for E in WTS
   are given vs. S as well as vs. some of the variables making up S.
   Well/trench sparging (WTS) has the potential to become a useful
   treatment method for removing VOCs from contaminated ground-water
   plumes. It is suited for use with most of the solvents and petroleum
   products which have caused extensive ground-water contamination. The
   theory of the method is simple, and the theoretical removal efficiencies
   are predictable as well as adjustable.}},

Abstract = {{A simple analytical method, adapted to hand calculations, is presented
   for evaluating the rise and fall of the leachate level in landfills due
   to possible changes of recharge caused by a landfill cap. The purpose is
   to provide an analytical tool for assessing the performance of landfill
   caps. A constant head boundary is assumed around the perimeter of the
   landfill, and the two-dimensional problem is solved using the linearized
   form of the Boussinesq equation. Percolation from rainfall or from other
   sources is assumed to be at a steady.rate and the only source for
   leachate generation and mound development. The numerical results from
   the simple model, in terms of mound rise or decline, as a function of
   time, were in accord with the solution using the MODFLOW numerical
   model.
   The results of the analysis show that the level of the leachate mound is
   sensitive to changes in the percolation rate, and based on this, it is
   concluded that the effectiveness of different cap conditions can be
   assessed by monitoring the leachate level within the leachate mound
   after cap installation. The analysis is specifically applicable for
   landfills containing a leachate mound such as landfills in a nonarid
   environment and where perimeter heads are controlled.}},

   cm/sec can be obtained by measuring the time when the temperature as
   measured by a thermistor peaks after applying a heat pulse. The
   automatic seepage meter was used to measure continuous seepage rates
   into Lake Biwa, Japan. The ground-water seepage rate measured by the
   automatic seepage meter in Lake Biwa changed by six times within 12
   hours. The automatic seepage meter is useful for surface-/ground-water
   studies, because a continuous seepage rate can be obtained without
   errors caused by the resistance of a collection bag to water flow.}},

Abstract = {{The recently completed National Pesticide Survey conducted by the United
   States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified the presence
   of various pesticides in ground water. The detection of pesticides in
   the nation's ground water has raised concerns for public health which
   has led resource managers in federal and state agencies to recognize
   that risk assessment is vital for water quality protection. This paper
   presents a methodology for risk-based evaluation of ground-water
   contamination by agricultural pesticides. The methodology utilizes the
   Risk of Unsaturated/Saturated Transport and Transformation of Chemical
   concentrations (RUSTIC) model to provide simulations that yield the
   probable risks associated with a given pesticide. Risk is expressed in
   terms of the probability of predicted pesticide mass exceeding its
   recommended health standards. Three widely used agricultural herbicides,
   simazine, atrazine, and alachlor, were evaluated using long-term
   (1960-1986) meteorological data for Ames, Iowa. Results indicate that
   for a well 8 m deep located 200 m horizontally from a pesticide
   application area in an alluvial sand and gravel setting, the probability
   of exceeding the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for simazine is about
   35\%, whereas it is nearly zero for both atrazine and alachlor. Prudent
   use of simazine in very susceptible areas is recommended.}},

   the effects of saline-water irrigation and gypsum addition in a semiarid

   deposit samples, it was shown that most of the salts added by
   agricultural activity accumulate in the unsaturated profile. Seventy to
   ninety percent Of SO4-2, Na+, and Cl- added are retained in the upper
   2-4 meters of the profile after 6 to 12 years of cultivation, regardless
   of the soil type. The most common accumulating ions are Na+ and SO4-2
   that minimize gypsum amendment thereby increasing with time the danger

Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{370-375}},

Abstract = {{A simple analytical expression is presented which predicts how solute
   concentrations evolve with time in a pumped well. The basic expression
   is for uniform recharge and uniform concentration of a conservative
   solute (e.g. nitrate) in the recharge. It shows that pumped
   concentrations are independent of pumping rates. The expression can be
   developed to allow for more complex patterns of recharge and solute
   loading, and an example is given with three zones of recharge and
   concentrations, induced river recharge, and a cross-boundary inflow.
   Predictions are made for Edgmond Bridge, a new pumping station which
   lies in a drift-filled valley in the Triassic sandstone aquifer of
   Shropshire, UK. The model predicts that concentrations of nitrate will
   stay below the drinking water limit for 78 years, although this would be
   substantially reduced if the aquifer were significantly layered or if
   nitrate loads from agriculture increased. Predictions were reevaluated
   after two years and found to be consistent with observed patterns once
   actual, rather than expected, conditions were incorporated in the model.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate derived from commercial NH4NO3 fertilizer, deltaN-15=+1.5 parts
   per thousand, applied to fertility plots was extracted from two cores to
   depths of 46 and 52 ft. In both cores the deltaN-15 of the extracted
   nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) showed that it became heavier with depth.
   Although this isotope fractionation did not cause deltaN-15 values to
   overlap with those characteristic of animal waste sources (> + 10 parts
   per thousand), deltaN-15 values were as high as + 8 parts per thousand
   at the bottom of one profile. The gradual increase in deltaN-15 with
   depth in the bottom 20 to 30 ft of the cores is consistent with
   denitrification at these depths. Clay content was much more variable
   with depth and was significantly associated with NO3-N concentrations (r
   = + 0.9) in the core with 30\% clay. Correlation of NO3-N concentrations
   to clay content was not significant in the other core with 50\% clay. In
   both cores smectite and illite were the dominant clays; chlorite, and
   aluminum and iron oxyhydroxides were not detected by XRD. Anion exchange
   capacity measurements confirmed that it was not responsible for the
   observed variability in NO3-N concentrations or deltaN-15 values.
   Potassium chloride (KCl) extracts yielded significantly higher NO3-N
   concentrations (p < 0.005) and lighter deltaN-15 values (p < 0.0001)
   than distilled deionized water (DDW) extracts. It is postulated that
   NO3- not extracted by DDW is trapped within the microstructure of the
   swelling clays. The strongly depleted deltaN-15 of - 16.3 parts per
   thousand may be attributed to pH-mediated aqueous ammonia or nitrate
   diffusion and/or ammonia volatilization into the smectite
   microstructure. Results indicated that DDW rather than KCl extractions
   of sediments high in smectite (> 40\%) provide more realistic estimates
   of ground-water loading from nonpoint sources.}},

Abstract = {{The annual regime of shallow ground-water levels across Poland is
   analyzed according to the dominance of continental and oceanic air
   masses. Mean monthly ground-water levels are transformed into relative
   values and, in order to show the spatial patterns of the annual regime
   throughout Poland, the contours of such values are derived for each
   month of the year.
   The shallow ground-water regime in Poland can be correlated with the
   degree of the climatic continentality. The main difference between the
   mildly oceanic northwestern part of Poland and the continental eastern
   part is the pattern of the winter regime which responds differentially
   to snowmelt. In the northwestern part of Poland, ground-water levels
   during late fall and winter are higher than those in the continental
   eastern part of the country. From April to September, there is no
   distinct difference between the ground-water levels in those two parts
   of Poland.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of ground-water exchange between ponds or large-radius
   conduits and surrounding aquifers is a common problem in contaminant
   migration studies. Analytic solutions are useful tools for this
   evaluation, particularly when the system is incompletely characterized. 
   Solutions are derived below for application to ponds, lakes, and natural
   or artificial conduits with a known discharge/recharge flux.  General
   features of migration in this setting are determined by the ratio of
   pond flux (source/sink) to regional flux crossing the pond boundary.
   When this ratio is large (pond dominates) the effect of the pond is
   indistinguishable from a well. At intermediate values, movement from the
   pond against the regional flow is inhibited, and discharge plumes are
   shifted downgradient relative to those for a well. At small ratios only
   a narrow plume will emerge from the downgradient side of a discharging
   pond, considerably narrower but longer than predicted for a well of the
   same strength.}},

Abstract = {{A technique based on numerical ground-water flow modeling and
   unconstrained nonlinear optimization has been developed to provide
   guidance for protecting municipal ground-water supplies from
   contamination through capture zone management. The technique involves
   conventional finite-difference ground-water flow modeling and numerical
   flowpath/travel time calculation coupled with nonlinear mathematical
   programming. The objective of the technique is to specify pumping rates
   for wells in a wellfield such that the configuration of capture zones in
   relation to existing potential sources of contamination minimizes the
   risk of contamination while maintaining the required total water output
   from the wellfield. An important feature of the technique is its ability
   to incorporate realistic boundary conditions, complicated aquifer
   configurations, and spatially varying aquifer properties to whatever
   degree site-specific data are available. Also, the technique is
   implemented on a personal computer. This approach to ground-water supply
   protection enhances conventional wellhead protection area delineation
   because a greater level of protection can be achieved if potential
   contaminant sources are not even included in capture zones, rather than
   attempting to reduce the threat of those sources. The effectiveness of
   the technique was verified through application to a hypothetical
   ground-water system. Practical aspects were demonstrated with an
   application in Pekin, Illinois. These efforts demonstrate the utility of
   an innovative modeling technique in ground-water quality protection.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{410-416}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Two water quality concerns with aquifer storage and recovery (ASR)
   operations are (1) the fate of organochlorine compounds, such as
   trihalomethanes (THMs), in the treated recharge source, and (2) the
   formation of organochlorine compounds from precursor materials following
   the chlorination of recovered water. The fate of chloroorganic compounds
   in chlorinated Colorado River water was studied during a 1989
   recharge/recovery operation conducted by the Las Vegas Valley Water
   District (LVVWD). Water samples were obtained from two dual-purpose
   wells during the pumping cycle for THMs and other indicators of
   organochlorine precursors. The percentage recovery of THMs was
   approximately the same as the percentage recovery of Colorado River
   water. This suggests that the removal of organochlorine compounds (e.g.,
   by sorption) did not appreciably occur in the aquifer materials at the
   two well sites. Recovery of source water was incomplete. Accordingly,
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC), representing precursor material,
   remained in the aquifer at the end of the pumping cycle. The Las Vegas
   experience suggests that prolonged recharge and storage of Colorado
   River water in similar hydrogeologic basins (e.g., the Tucson basin)
   could result in problems with THM compliance at the well head. This will
   be a problem if THM standards are reduced during the interval that water
   is stored.}},

Abstract = {{A regional ground-water quality survey from 28 wells in the Coventry
   area of the United Kingdom identified widespread ground-water pollution.
   Chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents (CHSs) were detected at concentrations
   exceeding 1 microgram per liter (mug/l) in all industrial and public
   water supply wells within the urban area. Of the CHSs analyzed,
   trichloroethene was most ubiquitous and was also detected at the highest
   concentrations, reaching a maximum of 547 mug/l at the industrial `'Site
   A'' during this study. By comparison with CHS pollution, inorganic and
   trace element concentrations were elevated relative to assumed baseline
   levels only in some industrial wells. The limited extent of inorganic
   contamination may be due to (1) retention of pollutants within the
   unsaturated zone, (2) ground-water mixing in wells, (3) ferric hydroxide
   precipitation resulting in heavy metal coprecipitation, and (4) sorption
   on sand grains coated with ferric hydroxide. For inorganic determinants,
   a pollution index was devised which ranked zinc and boron as primary
   indicators of inorganic contamination. Regionally, concentrations of CHS

   soil remediation in removing volatile and semivolatile organic compounds
   from the vadose zone. The rate and extent of removal of volatile organic
   compounds from the vadose zone by active or passive vapor extraction
   systems are known to be affected by a number of factors, including soil
   permeability, soil moisture content, applied suction, air flow rate,
   temperature, vapor pressure, and external boundary conditions. Some
   techniques used to describe the dynamics of gas flow are based on
   simplifying assumptions which limit their application in `'real world''
   situations. This paper describes the development and testing of a
   three-dimensional gas flow model `'GAS3D'' for the design of soil
   venting systems. The model takes into account the effect of partial
   penetration and partial screening of vapor extraction wells as well as
   the nonhomogeneity and anisotropy of the soil. The simulated pressure
   around a vapor extraction well by the developed CAS3D model was verified
   and validated by comparing the results of the finite-difference solution
   to the actual field measurements and the results of an analytical
   solution under homogeneous and isotropic conditions. The model was used
   in a case study to demonstrate the utility of the developed model under
   heterogeneous and anisotropic conditions for designing a vapor
   extraction system.}},

Abstract = {{The design of vapor-extraction remedial systems and the analysis of
   their performance can be improved by using models that can simulate the
   chemical and physical processes affecting the occurrence and movement of
   multiple-compound vapor-phase chemical mixtures. Previous models fall
   into two categories: (1) multiple-compound phase distribution models
   which are either nondimensional (no transport) or one-dimensional
   (column experiments); and (2) multidimensional, single-compound
   transport models. In this paper, a model is presented that couples the
   steady-state vapor flow equation, the advection-diffusion transport
   equation, and a multiple-compound, multiphase chemical partitioning
   model. The numerical implementation allows spatially variable fields of
   permeability, confining layer permeability, and initial contaminant
   concentrations. Based on the concentrations of each chemical compound,
   the model calculates whether a nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) is
   present, and calculates the chemical phase distribution by the
   appropriate equilibrium partitioning formulation (Henry's Law or
   Raoult's Law).
   The user can specify the location and discharge rates of any number of
   extraction or injection wells, including zero wells, in which case the
   simulation will solve transport by diffusion only. The remediation, by
   vapor extraction, of hypothetical fuel hydrocarbon spills was simulated
   to investigate the error introduced by failing to account for natural
   (nonideal) conditions. The nonideal conditions include inhomogeneous
   soil permeability, leakage of atmospheric air into the subsurface (as
   from a bare ground surface), and irregular contaminant distribution. The
   model was also run in the pure diffusion mode to simulate the transport
   of benzene to the ground surface, and to show the limitations of
   single-compound vapor flux models when a multicompound NAPL (such as
   gasoline) represents the source of benzene.}},

Abstract = {{A mesoscale model soil and ground-water system was constructed and
   instrumented to study physical, chemical, and microbial processes,
   including transport and degradation of contaminants. The model system
   was 4.6 m in height by 2.4 m in diameter and contained up to 65 tonnes
   of soil and geologic materials. The model was filled with Ap (11 cm), B
   (20 cm), Cl and C2 (369 cm) horizons; the water table was 3.3 m from the
   soil surface. A rain simulation system applied uniform coverage of rain
   and/or chloride tracer to the model. Sampling of soil, sediment, pore
   waters, and gas phase was carried out using a series of in situ
   collectors and sampling ports. Major anions, metals, pH, alkalinity,
   CO2, N2, O2, CH4. microbial numbers, microbial biomass and heterotrophic
   potential (C-14-amino-acid uptake) were monitored over time (120 days)
   and depth. The system approached steady state with respect to solution
   chemistry and gases after approximately 60-70 days. During this
   interval, carbon dioxide rose from atmospheric to 3-5\% of total gas
   volume measured at each sampling depth above the water table. Physical,
   chemical, and biological conditions in the model system after the
   initial 120 days were comparable to those reported for vadose and
   saturated zones during field studies on shallow phreatic aquifers. These
   results indicated that the mesoscale model preserved many of the
   features of natural systems while providing controlled conditions for
   studies such as evaluating the fate, and ground-water contamination
   potential, of agricultural and industrial chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{The method of characteristics (e.g., Garder et al., 1964; Konikow and
   Bredehoeft, 1978) has been widely used in the simulation of solute
   transport in ground-water systems because of its effectiveness for
   handling advection-dominated problems. However, the method requires a
   large amount of computer memory and execution time when it is necessary
   to track a large number of moving particles, especially in three
   dimensions. The method can also lead to large mass balance discrepancies
   under certain circumstances. This paper describes a number of changes
   which may be made in the traditional method of characteristics approach
   to mitigate these difficulties. These changes include a dynamic particle
   allocation procedure, which often reduces dramatically the total number
   of moving particles needed in a simulation; and a consistent velocity
   interpolation scheme and higher-order particle tracking techniques,
   which, coupled with effective handling of particle insertion and
   deletion at sources and sinks, can provide improved mass balance
   results. The accuracy of a method-of-characteristics model incorporating
   these changes is evaluated by comparison with analytical solutions for
   (1) three-dimensional advection and dispersion in a spherical flow
   field, and (2) concentration change in a well during an
   injection/pumping cycle.}},

Abstract = {{It has recently been recognized that mobile colloids may affect the
   transport of contaminants in ground water. To determine the significance
   of this process, knowledge of both the total mobile load (dissolved +
   colloid-associated) and the dissolved concentration of a ground-water
   contaminant must be obtained. Additional information regarding mobile
   colloid characteristics and concentrations are required to predict
   accurately the fate and effects of contaminants at sites where
   significant quantities of colloids are found. To obtain this
   information, a sampling scheme has been designed and refined to collect
   mobile colloids while avoiding the inclusion of normally immobile
   subsurface and well-derived solids. The effectiveness of this sampling
   protocol was evaluated at a number of contaminated and pristine sites.
   The sampling results indicated that slow, prolonged pumping of ground
   water is much more effective at obtaining ground-water samples that
   represent in situ colloid populations than bailing. Bailed samples from
   a coal tar-contaminated site contained 10-100 times greater colloid
   concentrations and up to 750 times greater polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbon concentrations as were detected in slowly pumped samples.
   The sampling results also indicated that ground-water colloid
   concentrations should be monitored in the field to determine the
   adequacy of purging if colloid and colloid-associated contaminants are
   of interest. To avoid changes in the natural ground-water colloid
   population through precipitation or coagulation, in situ ground-water
   chemistry conditions must be preserved during sampling and storage.
   Samples collected for determination of the total mobile load of colloids
   and low-solubility contaminants must not be filtered because some mobile
   colloids are removed by this process. Finally, suggestions that mobile
   colloids are present in ground water at any particular site should be
   corroborated with auxiliary data, such as colloid levels in
   `'background'' wells, colloid-size distributions, ground-water
   geochemistry, and colloid surface characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Digital tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) store,
   analyze, map, and illustrate large amounts of diverse electronic data.
   This paper develops a GIS modeling user interface for delineating
   Wellhead Protection Areas (WHPAs) around public water-supply wells. With
   this modeling interface, the user can extract the necessary information
   from the GIS database automatically. The CIS database can then store the
   delineated WHPAs for further analysis and display. The modeling
   interface allows local agencies to delineate and manage WHPAs for
   hundreds of wells more efficiently and effectively than with the
   traditional paper maps and overlay system.
   In order to demonstrate the efficiency of the user interface, this paper
   presents a wellhead delineation pilot study for the City of Houston.
   WHPAs for the 202 active public water-supply wells in the city were
   delineated using GIS and the modeling interface. Detailed sensitivity
   analyses were completed to evaluate the effect of uncertainty in model
   parameters on the delineated WHPAs. Potential sources of contamination
   within the delineated WHPAs were then identified using the GIS database.
   While GIS are perceived as an important tool that can enhance a user's
   ability for spatial data analyses, they have many problems. The system
   hardware and software require a substantial investment in financial and
   human resources. Database development is a tricky process requiring
   planning and commitment; in most cases, the anticipated outcome from GIS
   software development is not immediately realized.}},

Abstract = {{Cylindrical (axisymmetric) flow to a well is an important specialized

   Geological Survey Modular Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference
   Ground-Water Flow Model provides the opportunity to simulate
   axisymmetric flow to a well. The theory involves the conceptualization
   of a system of concentric shells that are capable of reproducing the
   large variations in gradient in the vicinity of the well by decreasing
   their area in the direction of the well. The computer program presented
   serves as a preprocessor to the U.S. Geological Survey model by creating
   the input data file needed to implement the axisymmetric
   conceptualization. Data input requirements to this preprocessor are
   described, and a comparison with a known analytical solution indicates
   that the model functions appropriately.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes, N-15 and O-18 have been used as tracers to
   differentiate a contaminant nitrate plume emanating from a single
   domestic septic system, in a ground-water system characterized by high
   and similar nitrate content outside and inside of the contaminant plume.
   A good delineation of the nitrate plume of septic origin was obtained
   using N-15 analysis in nitrate. The N-15 content of the nonplume nitrate
   is in agreement with the sources of nitrate: solid cattle manure,
   synthetic fertilizer (NH4-NO3), and soil organic nitrogen, at the study
   site. O-18 analysis in nitrate did not provide enough isotopic contrast
   to permit separation of nitrate derived from the septic system and that
   in the surrounding ground water, derived from agricultural fertilizer
   sources. O-18 data indicated that nitrification of ammonium is the main
   process responsible for formation of nitrate at the study site. O-18 in
   ground water clearly delineated the ground-water plume associated with
   the septic system and suggest that this tracer should be considered in
   studies related with contaminant plumes of different origin.}},

   between the fractal character of hydraulic conductivity distribution and
   the statistics of unsaturated flow. This was studied by means of Monte
   Carlo simulations of steady-state infiltration in soils with generated

Abstract = {{The use of steady-state models can sometimes reduce the computational
   resources and input data required for solution of transient transport
   problems. A large column experiment was performed to test whether solute
   transport parameters determined from a steady flow experiment may be
   used in transient, unsaturated flow and transport model predictions.
   Tritiated water and bromide were applied at a steady rate to the top of
   a 0.95 m diameter by 6 m deep soil column containing unsaturated soil.
   After 10 days, tracers were eliminated from the irrigation water. When
   the soil moisture content within the column ceased to change, another
   10-day pulse of tritiated water and bromide was applied, followed by
   water without tracers. Transport model parameters were determined
   through optimization, using breakthrough curves observed at various
   depths. The tritiated water and bromide pulses lagged behind the wetting
   front during infiltration into the relatively dry soil. The bromide
   pulse moved 17-20\% faster than the tritiated water pulse, because of
   anion exclusion. Breakthrough curves for the transient and steady-state
   experiments were similar. Because the solute fronts lagged significantly
   behind the moisture fronts, steady-state transport parameters, when used
   in a fully transient numerical model, fairly described the transport
   under transient conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Because a water sample collected from a well is an integration of water
   from different depths along the well screen, measured concentrations can
   be biased if analyte concentrations are not uniform along the length of
   the well screen. The resulting concentration in the sample, therefore,
   is a function of variations in well-screen inflow rate and analyte
   concentration with depth. A multiport sampler with seven short screened
   intervals was designed and used to investigate small-scale vertical
   variations in water chemistry and aquifer hydraulic conductivity in
   ground water contaminated by leaded gasoline at Galloway Township,
   Atlantic County, New Jersey. The multiport samplers were used to collect
   independent samples from seven intervals within the screened zone that
   were flow-rate weighted and integrated to simulate a 5-foot-long,
   2.375-inch-outside-diameter conventional wire-wound screen. The
   integrations of the results of analyses of samples collected from two
   multiport samplers showed that a conventional 5-foot-long well screen
   would integrate contaminant concentrations over its length and resulted
   in an apparent contaminant concentration that was as little as 28
   percent of the maximum concentration observed in the multiport sampler.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most difficult tasks in hydrogeology is to develop
   sustainable supplies of potable ground water from small atoll islands.
   Fresh ground-water systems within atolls, if they exist at all, are
   extremely fragile and sensitive to development stresses. In this study,
   the mathematical model SUTRA was used to examine development
   alternatives for a two-phase miscible ground-water system in a cross
   section through the Laura area of Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands. The
   geological framework modeled for Laura is a multilayered aquifer system
   in which the primary members are a sequence of moderately permeable
   Holocene carbonate sediments overlying highly permeable Pleistocene
   sediments and reef materials. Ground water in this system consists of a
   thin layer of fresh water separated from underlying sea water by a
   relatively thick, transitional layer of mixed saline and fresh water.
   Sensitivity analysis indicates that the modeled depth to the 50\%
   salinity contour is most sensitive to permeability, and the
   transition-zone thickness is most sensitive to transverse dispersivity.
   Results from the development analysis verify that shallow, linear
   skimming wells, or galleries, are the most efficient means of extracting
   fresh ground water.}},

Abstract = {{During the time over which the data for a regional hydrogeochemical
   survey are collected, the physical and chemical attributes of the
   ground-water flow regime may exhibit appreciable temporal variation. A
   case study is presented in which the temporal variance of many physical
   and chemical attributes of ground water at single locations was close to
   or even exceeded the spatial variance of concentrations measured over
   the region at a single point in time. Thus, the results of a
   multivariate analysis of the spatial variability could have led to
   incorrect inferences had the regional sampling not been done within a
   period of time that was short enough so that no appreciable temporal
   variation occurred. A methodology using both spectral and multivariate
   analyses was used in determining: (a) the window of time allowable in
   collecting the water samples so that the temporal variability of the
   attributes did not affect the spatial analyses, and (b) the dominant
   factors that explain the spatial variability of physical and chemical
   attributes at that particular period in time.}},

   introduced, in spite of the quantitative nature of transmissivity values

   objective comparison of transmissivity values characterizing different
   areas and hydrogeological environments. A combined classification of

Abstract = {{It is becoming widely recognized that field-scale ground-water
   contaminant plumes are irregular and difficult to predict. Factors;
   which complicate the characterization of such plumes include geological
   variability, data limitations, and uncertainties about the source of
   contamination. This paper describes a new approach to site
   characterization which accounts for variability and uncertainty in a
   systematic way. The site characterization procedure extracts more
   information from limited data by combining field measurements with
   predictions from a stochastic ground-water model. The model provides
   prior estimates of the mean and standard deviation of solute
   concentration throughout a contaminated site. These estimates are
   updated whenever new measurements of hydraulic conductivity, head,
   and/or concentration become available. The updated concentration
   standard deviation estimates may be used to guide the placement of
   sampling wells and to evaluate the accuracy of the site
   characterization. If updating and data collection are carried out
   sequentially, over a series of discrete sampling rounds, the sampling
   network can evolve in response to new information. A case study
   described in the paper illustrates how the characterization procedure
   can be applied to a typical field site.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term safe withdrawal rate for a coastal aquifer in Mannar
   Island of Sri Lanka was assessed through the simulation of interface
   movement. A range of estimates of natural recharge sequence was first
   obtained from a water balance study considering the variations of
   factors affecting the soil moisture balance. The representative recharge
   sequence was then determined through the simulation of a field observed
   interface profile along a selected section. Following this, the
   sustainability of continuous water withdrawal in the future was assessed
   by limiting the extent of salt-water upconing. An increase in the
   withdrawal rate in the future would be possible through proper
   monitoring of the system response.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate concentrations in excess of national drinking-water standards
   (10 mg/l as N) are present in certain sand-plain aquifers in central
   Minnesota. To investigate nitrate sources in the aquifers,
   nitrogen-isotope values of nitrate (delta(N(NO3))-N-15) were measured in
   shallow ground water from 51 wells in five land-use settings. The
   land-use settings and corresponding average nitrate concentrations (as
   N) and delta(N(NO3)-N-15 values are: livestock feedlots, 12.7 mg/l, 21.3
   parts per thousand cultivated-irrigated fields, 13 mg/l, 7.4 parts per
   thousand; residential areas with septic systems, 8.3 mg/l, 6.0 parts per
   thousand; cultivated-nonirrigated fields, 15.5 mg/l, 3.4 parts per
   thousand; and natural, undeveloped areas, 3.8 mg/l, 3.1 parts per
   thousand. Values of delta(N(NO3))-N-15 less than 2 parts per thousand
   suggest that nitrogen from commercial inorganic fertilizers exists in
   ground water beneath all settings except the feedlots. Values of
   delta(N(NO3))-N-15 greater than 10 parts per thousand suggest that
   nitrogen from animal waste is present in ground water beneath certain
   feedlots, cultivated-irrigated fields that are fertilized with manure,
   and residential areas with septic systems. Values of delta(N(NO3))N-15
   between 22 and 43 parts per thousand in ground water beneath the
   feedlots probably result from denitrification. Values of
   delta(N(NO3))-N-15 increase with depth in many locations in the
   sand-plain aquifers. These increases may be caused by progressive
   denitrification with depth or by changes with depth in the proportions
   of nitrate from different sources. Similarly, variations of
   delta(N(NO3))-N-15 values from 1986 to 1987 in certain locations may be
   due to temporal variations in the amounts of denitrification or to
   changes in the proportions of nitrate from different sources.
   Ambiguities in the interpretation of changes in delta(N(NO3))N-15 values
   could be eliminated by increasing the spatial and temporal frequency of
   sampling.}},

Abstract = {{One method of remediating contaminated soil and ground water through
   management of the subsurface environment so that indigenous
   microorganisms can biodegrade organic contaminants. Modeling and
   simulation offer promising means of assessing the migration and
   attenuation of such contaminants being treated in situ in the
   subsurface. In this paper, a macropore flow model has been developed to
   account for bioremediation in the interstitial spaces among soil
   aggregates. This model has been combined with another bioremediation
   model which accounts for diffusion and biodegradation in the micropores
   and soil particles in the aggregates. The combined model comprises a
   system of six coupled equations, of which three are nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations and three are nonlinear partial differential
   equations. Dimensional analysis of these equations has yielded useful
   dimensionless parameters for evaluating the relative significance of
   each mechanism in remediation. Numerical experiments have been conducted
   to evaluate the effects of initial contaminant concentration, aggregate
   size, and soil-water partition factor. The total time of remediation has
   been found to depend on the rate at which contaminants are consumed
   within the large aggregates which, in turn, depends on the
   biodegradation kinetics and the rates of diffusion of substrate and
   oxygen in the aggregates. For soil with aggregates whose radius is 1 cm
   or larger, the results of simulation indicate that the remediation time
   for the aggregates is significantly longer compared to the corresponding
   result for homogeneous soil. For contaminants with large partition
   coefficients, the estimated time for remediation achieved through
   microbial oxidation in situ is much shorter than that achieved through
   purely diffusional transport of the contaminants out of the soil bed.}},

Abstract = {{The vertical distribution of free and residual aviation gasoline, a
   light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL), through the capillary fringe of a
   uniform, medium sand is measured and used to calibrate an existing
   model. The total saturation profile is governed by a classical moisture
   retention characteristic, with the matric pressure bead scaled by
   LNAPL/air surface tension in the presence of free LNAPL and water/air
   surface tension in the absence of free LNAPL. The residual LNAPL is
   described by an empirical equation reflecting hysteretical trapping due
   to a fluctuating water table. The existing theory is calibrated with new
   and published field data at an aviation gasoline spill site in Traverse
   City, Michigan.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty analysis methods can be applied to numerical models of
   ground-water flow to estimate the relative importance of physical and
   hydrologic input variables with respect to ground-water travel time.
   Monte Carlo numerical simulations of unsaturated flow in the Calico
   Hills nonwelded zeolitic (CHnz) layer at Yucca Mountain, Nevada,
   indicate that variability in recharge, and to a lesser extent in matrix
   porosity, explains most of the variability in predictions of water
   travel time through the unsaturated zone. Variations in saturated
   hydraulic conductivity and unsaturated curve-fitting parameters were not
   statistically significant in explaining variability in water travel time
   through the unsaturated CHnz unit. The results of this study suggest
   that the large uncertainty associated with recharge rate estimates for
   the Yucca Mountain site is of concern because the performance of the
   potential repository would be more sensitive to uncertainty in recharge
   than to any other parameter evaluated. These results are not exhaustive
   because of the limited site characterization data available and because
   of the preliminary nature of this study, which is limited to a single
   stratigraphic unit, one dimension, and does not account for fracture
   flow or other potential fast pathways at Yucca Mountain.}},

Abstract = {{The Jacob straight-line method of aquifer analysis deals with the
   late-time data and small radius of the Theis type curve which plot as a
   straight line if the drawdown data are plotted on an arithmetic scale
   and the time data on a logarithmic (base 10) scale. Correct analysis
   with the Jacob method normally assumes that (1) the data lie on a
   straight line, (2) the value of the dimensionless time factor is less
   than 0.01, and (3) the site's hydrogeology conforms to the method's
   assumptions and limiting conditions. Items 1 and 2 are usually
   considered for the Jacob method, but item 3 is often ignored, which can
   lead to incorrect calculations of aquifer parameters. A BASIC computer
   program was developed to analyze aquifer test data with the Jacob method
   to test the validity of its use. Aquifer test data are entered into the
   program and manipulated so that a slope and time intercept of the
   straight line drawn through the data (excluding early-time and late-time
   data) can be used to calculate transmissivity and storage coefficient.
   Late-time data are excluded to eliminate the effects of positive and
   negative boundaries. The time-drawdown data then are converted into
   dimensionless units to determine if the Jacob methods assumptions are
   valid for the hydrogeologic conditions under which the test was
   conducted.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the water requirement for Madras is met from surface- and
   ground-water supplies piped in from outside the city limits. However, as
   is the case for many cities, a certain proportion of the population,
   usually the poorest, is forced to rely on wells within the urban area. A
   study was therefore carried out to gain an idea of the inorganic quality
   of the water in the wells penetrating the shallow (< 20 m thick)
   alluvial aquifer below the city. Two general surveys of selected wells
   across the city indicated that relative to Indian domestic water
   standards, of the 93 ground-water samples obtained, 25\% exceeded the Ca
   limit, 11\% the Mg limit, 43\% the total dissolved solids limit, 14\%
   the SO4 limit, and 70\% the NO3 limit. As an indicator of biological
   contamination, the high concentrations of NO3 (up to 1040 mg/1) are
   particularly worrying. A detailed survey of sites close to a city river
   was also undertaken. High heavy metal concentrations were detected, with
   As up to 0.42 mg/1, Hg to 0.02 mg/l, Pb to 1.82 mg/l, and Cd and 1.31
   mg/l. Microbes have been found in several of the wells. It is clear
   that, as expected, the shallow ground water is grossly polluted.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water in the plain area of China is recharged mostly with
   rainfall and to a lesser extent with surface water and nearby ground
   water. There are several methods for the calculation of recharge of
   rainfall seepage to ground water. The calculated values using different
   methods vary due to the accuracy of parameters and calculation methods
   chosen. A comparative study of methods used to calculate ground-water
   recharge by rainfall seepage is made using the water-balance method and
   the ground-water regime analysis method applied to the plain area of
   China. The accuracy of the ground-water regime analysis method is
   superior to that of the water-balance method. The influential factors
   (lithology, depth to ground water, precipitation capacity, etc.) of
   ground-water recharge by rainfall seepage and the accuracy of these
   factors are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Flow rates and concentrations from fractures intersected by a borehole
   can be estimated by matching simulated concentration profiles to the
   observed variations in water chemistry along the borehole. Experiments
   in karstic rocks prove that hydraulic short circuits between fractures
   yield a very complex flow pattern, and that flow velocities in the
   borehole may be higher than the velocity at which the piezometric level
   varies. Combined temperature and concentration studies characterize flow
   in both high permeability channels and slightly fissured blocks, as
   chemical profiles detect low velocity slows that cannot be identified on
   temperature profiles. Such studies are there fore advisable to
   characterize natural flow in fractured carbonate rocks, but also in
   other fractured media.}},

   pumping systems and we ea protection programs. Using discharge
   potentials, equations are derived that can be applied to confined,
   unconfined, or combined confined and unconfined aquifers. The transient
   equations are transcendental and cannot be solved explicitly. However,
   infinite-time (steady-state) equations are presented which can be
   solved. They define an area in which, theoretically, all the water in
   the aquifer will eventually reach the pumping well, although the
   equations do not consider the effects of hydrodynamic dispersion.
   Equations for calculating the stagnation point, upgradient divide, and
   dividing streamline within the aquifer and an example problem are

Abstract = {{Ground-water management decisions are usually taken under uncertainty,
   since they depend on unknown parameters of the aquifer such as hydraulic
   conductivity and specific discharge.  This study applies a number of
   analytical techniques to a case study in order to demonstrate the
   potential effect of vertical heterogeneity in the horizontal component
   of specific discharge on evaluating contaminant travel time in an
   aquifer. The modified point dilution technique developed by Ronen et al.
   (1986) is applied to study the vertical variability of the horizontal
   component of specific discharge in a deep unconfined sandy aquifer. This
   technique, used under natural flow conditions, employs multilayer
   sampler, a tracer, and a mathematical diffusion model. Also analyzed are
   data from a very large unplanned trac er test where the `'tracer,''
   sewage effluent with a high chloride content, was infiltrated into the
   aquifer for about 30 years, To date, based on available sedimentological
   evidence and pumping tests, the aquifer has been regarded as
   homogeneous. However, information from analysis of the tracer test data
   by two different flow models, and findings obtained by the modified
   point dilution technique, indicate the existence of zones of high
   hydraulic conductivity with specific discharges one order of magnitude
   higher than expected. As a consequence, chloride breakthrough in a
   pumping well downstream of effluent infiltration was detected after 110
   years, at least 70 years earlier than could have been estimated from
   previously available data. The results demonstrate that consideration
   must be given to vertical heterogeneity when evaluating contaminant
   transport and show that detailed site-specific field studies are needed
   in order to prevent or control aquifer contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Fournier's approximate method for relating self-potential anomalies to
   water-table elevation is satisfactory for five of the six sites where it
   has been tested in New Hampshire. At these sites water-table elevations
   were determined independently from observation of surface-water bodies
   and by seismic refraction at the times of the self-potential surveys.
   At three sites on drumlins formed of glacial till, the apparent coupling
   coefficients range from 0.95 to 4 mV/m whereas two surveys on sand and
   gravel deltas yield apparent coupling coefficients of - 16 and - 17
   mV/m. At a third delta the apparent coupling coefficient suggests that
   the water table is in an underlying till rather than in the deltaic
   deposits.
   Modeling of self-potential anomalies using Fournier's method may permit
   isolation of anomalies caused by sources other than ground-water flow as
   well as location of significant geological inhomogeneities. Because of
   nonuniqueness it is not possible to determine water-table elevations
   from self-potential surveys alone.}},

   and pesticide, when pesticide is under-sampled. The shallow, poorly
   confined, sand and gravel aquifer underlying the lower Malheur River
   basin near Ontario, Oregon is contaminated by nitrate and metabolites of
   the herbicide Dacthal (dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate) or DCPA. The
   results of extensive ground-water sampling indicate that a significant
   positive correlation exists between measured nitrate and DCPA
   concentrations in the aquifer. This suggests that future sampling should
   include a large number of the less-expensive nitrate analyses, and these
   data should be used to support the interpretation of fewer, more
   expensive DCPA analyses. Sample variograms were computed for nitrate and
   DCPA concentrations and were fit with isotropic, spherical variogram
   models with correlation ranges of 4 km. Incorporating measured nitrate
   concentrations in the DCPA estimates obtained by cokriging reduced
   estimation variances from 14 to 34\%. A simple economic analysis
   demonstrated that for this aquifer, acquiring additional nitrate samples
   is a cost-effective way to reduce estimation variances for DCPA.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to determine a well test model which
   could be used for determine the hydraulic parameters of T and S in the
   complex fractured carbonates of the Ozarks of southern Missouri.
   Municipal water well testing in the Ozarks is performed on deep wells
   completed in confined fractured carbonate aquifers where all of the flow
   to the wellbore is through the fractures but most of the storage is in
   the matrix blocks. Observation wells are not used because of cost. The
   methodology uses double porosity well test analysis including the inner
   boundary conditions of skin and wellbore storage. Using this method, S
   and T are obtained as well as the storativity ratio, omega, and the
   block to fracture flow parameter lambda. Because wellbore storage, skin,
   and storativity are interrelated, a computer simulation to find the
   final S was necessary. Derivative curve analysis provided a constraint
   in determining the correctness of the simulation results. Failure to use
   this well test method proved to result in storativities which are much
   too large. An example is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Onshore reflection seismics have been used to characterize the geometry
   and lithology of ground-water reservoirs. The study was carried out as a
   seismic sequence and facies analysis along Rabis Creek in western
   Denmark. A 1350 m long seismic section was produced on a presumed
   homogeneous outwash sand plain. High resolution data to a depth of 160 m
   (200 msec two-way time) were obtained along most of this section, and
   reflections from more than 400 m in depth were obtained locally. The
   seismic data have been correlated with electrical resistivity lop. The
   reservoir is, in contrast to the expectations, highly heterogeneous,
   composed of three distinguishable seismic sequences of unconsolidated
   sediments. Layers down to 1.5 m thick were recognized in the seismic
   data. The study shows that onshore reflection seismics provide a unique
   possibility of 2-D reservoir scale characterization of geological
   structures. Combined with seismic facies and sequence analysis, seismic
   profiling forms a strong hydrogeological tool that may supplement
   traditional boring and logging methods.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{98-106}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Established pump-and-treat ground-water remediation is criticized for
   being too expensive and time-consuming, especially when cleanup
   standards are set at very low levels, e.g., < 10 parts per billion (ppb)
   for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Although other ground-water
   remediation technologies are currently being examined and show
   intriguing promise, pump and treat remains the only dependable
   technology for cleanup of deep (i.e., > 50 ft below ground surface)
   widespread ground-water condition. The perceived shortcomings of pump
   and treat result from (1) the tendency of most contaminants to sorb to
   formatiom materials, thus retarding contaminant removal; (2) geologic
   complexity, which requires detailed characterization for the design of
   optimal extraction systems within available resources; and (3) the
   failure to apply dynamic well field management techniques.
   The alternative, `'smart pump and treat,'' consists of (1) detailed
   characterization of the geology, hydrology, and chemistry; (2) use of
   computer-aided data interpretation, data display, and decision support
   systems; (3) removal of source terms, if possible; (4) initial design
   for plume containment and source remediation; (5) phased installation of
   the well field; (6) detailed monitoring of the remediation; (7) active
   ongoing reevaluation of the operating well field, including redesign as
   appropriate (dynamic management); (8) reinjection of treated ground
   water to speed the flushing of contaminants; and (9) setting of
   appropriate cleanup levels. Use of some or all of these techniques can
   dramatically reduce the time required to achieve cleanup goals and thus
   the cost of ground-water remediation.}},

Abstract = {{A ground-water quality management model is applied to the Gloucester
   Landfill site, located near Ottawa, Canada, to examine the effectiveness
   of various single-well pumping schemes for the capture of dissolved
   contaminants. Deterministic and stochastic design analyses are conducted
   through ground-water solute transport modeling of the site. The purpose
   of the modeling analysis is to develop contaminant capture designs that
   both require minimum pumping rates and possess high probabilities of
   success.
   Optimization based upon deterministic simulation indicates that a well
   located at the front of the plume would effect plume capture and require
   the lowest pumping rate. However, a smaller total volume of water could
   be pumped and still effect plume capture if the well were located at the
   center of the plume and pumped at a higher rate for a shorter time.
   Stochastic optimization analyses are used to overdesign the pumping
   rates so that possible design error is overcome. The analyses indicate
   that design reliability may be increased from 50 to 90 percent by
   pumping an additional 18 percent at the front or 27 percent at the
   center of the plume. These pumping overdesign factors are the first such
   values calculated using the stochastic optimization approach applied to
   a field site.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of the value of longitudinal dispersivity is very
   important in the simulation of solute transport. Therefore, a method for
   the identification of longitudinal dispersivity in a solute transport
   laboratory experiment was developed. The solute was assumed to be ideal
   and the medium isotropic and homogeneous, with a one-dimensional
   geometry. The sensitivity of the inversion method to a uniform random
   noise in porosity, which accounts for possible heterogeneities of the
   medium, and to concentration measurement errors, which are always
   present in a laboratory experiment, was analyzed. This analysis is
   necessary to estimate the reliability of the method. Then, supposing the
   concentration error distributed according to a Gaussian with zero mean,
   the probability distribution of the relative identification error was
   computed as a function of the standard deviation of the Gaussian. The
   mean value of the relative identification error was found to be
   positive, due to the nonlinearity of the identification algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{To study the effect of spatial variability of sediment hydraulic
   properties on multiphase flow, oil infiltration into a hypothetical
   glacial outwash aquifer, followed by oil extraction, was simulated using
   a cross-sectional multiphase flow model. The analysis was simplified by
   neglecting capillary hysteresis. The first simulation used a uniform
   mean permeability and mean retention curve. This was followed by 50
   Monte Carlo simulations conducted using 50 spatially variable
   permeability realizations and corresponding spatially variable retention
   curves. For the type of correlation structure considered in this study,
   which is similar to that of glacial outwash deposits, use of mean
   hydraulic properties reproduces the ensemble average oil saturation
   distribution obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations. However, spatial
   variability the oil saturation distribution in an individual oil lens to
   differ significantly from that of the mean lens. Oil saturations at a
   given location may be considerably higher than would be predicted using
   uniform mean properties. During cleanup by oil extraction from a well,
   considerably more oil may remain behind in the heterogeneous case than
   in the spatially uniform case.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical analyses were used to determine the relation of
   hydrogeologic, well construction, and field measurement factors to the
   extremely variable yield of wells located in consolidated rocks in the
   Piedmont, Blue Ridge, and Valley and Ridge provinces of Pennsylvania.
   Specific capacity values (a total of 4,391) from the U.S. Geological
   Survey well record file were chosen as a measure of yield. Results
   underscore the importance in regional analysis of accounting for
   differences due to variables related to well construction and field
   measurement of specific capacity before attempting to account for
   differences due to hydrogeology. The approach taken was to organize a
   hierarchy of variables that relate to differences in specific capacity.
   Linear regression using log-transformed specific capacity as the
   response variable provided estimates of the extent to which variables
   account for variation in the specific capacity values. Among the
   variables available for consideration, casing diameter, primary water
   use, and duration of discharge during the well production test are most
   important and can explain 24 percent of the variation observed in the
   specific capacity data. Lithology alone can account for only about 12
   percent of the variation observed in the specific capacity data.
   However, a classification of rocks based on lithology and also
   accounting for differences in casing diameter, water use, duration of
   discharge, topographic setting, well depth, and casing depth can explain
   about half the variation in specific capacity values.}},

Abstract = {{A combined field and laboratory study was conducted to compare purge and
   trap gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PT-GC/MS) and purgeable
   organic chloride (POCI) analysis for measuring volatile chlorinated
   hydrocarbons (VCH) in ground water. Distilled-water spike and recovery
   experiments using 10 VCH indicate that at concentrations greater than 1
   mug/l recovery is more than 80 percent for both methods with relative
   standard deviations of about 10 percent. Ground-water samples were
   collected from a site on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, where a shallow
   unconfined aquifer has been contaminated by VCH, and were analyzed by
   both methods. Results for PT-GC/MS and POCl analysis of the ground-water
   samples were not significantly different (alpha = 0.05, paired t-test
   analysis) and indicated little bias between the two methods. Similar
   conclusions about concentrations and distributions of VCH in the
   ground-water contamination plume were drawn from the two data sets.
   However, only PT-GC/MS analysis identified the individual compounds
   present and determined their concentrations, which was necessary for
   toxicological and biogeochemical evaluation of the contaminated ground
   water. POCI analysis was a complimentary method for use with PT-GC/MS
   analysis for identifying samples with VCH concentrations below the
   detection limit or with high VCH concentrations that require dilution.
   Use of POCl as a complimentary monitoring method for PT-GC/MS can result
   in more efficient use of analytical resources.}},

Abstract = {{In 1975, the loss of approximately 83,000 gallons of JP-4 grade jet fuel
   resulted in contamination of the shallow aquifer near North Charleston,
   South Carolina. To identify those factors likely to influence microbial
   activity under denitrifying conditions, we examined the fate of amended
   NO3, the effect of pH, NO3, and PO4 on denitrification, and the
   variability of denitrification in sediments collected at the site.
   Denitrification (N2O-N production) accounted for 98\% of the depletion
   of NO3-N under anaerobic conditions. Both carbon mineralization and
   denitrification rates increased asymptotically with increasing NO3 to a
   maximum at approximately 1 mM NO3. Addition of up to 1 mM PO4 did not
   significantly increase N2O and CO2 production. Denitrification rates
   were at least 38\% lower at pH = 4 than observed at pH = 7. Comparison
   of samples with differing degrees of hydrocarbon contamination indicated
   that at least a tenfold variation in sediment denitrification occurs at
   the North Charleston site.}},

Abstract = {{Increased ground-water contamination from human activities on Long
   Island has prompted studies to define the pattern and rate of
   ground-water movement. A two-dimensional, fine-mesh, finite-element
   model consisting of 11,969 nodes and 22,880 elements was constructed to
   represent ground-water flow along a north-south section through central
   Long Island. The model represents average hydrologic conditions within a
   corridor approximately 15 miles wide. The model solves discrete
   approximations of both the potential and stream functions. The resulting
   flownet depicts flow paths and defines the vertical distribution of flow
   within the section. Ground-water flow rates decrease with depth.
   Sixty-two percent of the water flows no deeper than the upper glacial
   (water-table) aquifer, 38 percent enters the underlying Magothy aquifer,
   and only 3.1 percent enters the Lloyd aquifer. The limiting streamlines
   for flow to the Magothy and Lloyd aquifers indicate that aquifer
   recharge areas are narrow east-west bands through the center of the
   island. The recharge area of the Magothy aquifer is only 5.4 miles wide;
   that of the Lloyd aquifer is less than 0.5 miles.
   The distribution of ground-water traveltime and a flownet are calculated
   from model results; both are useful in the investigation of contaminant
   transport or the chemical evolution of ground water within the flow
   system. A major discontinuity in traveltime occurs across the streamline
   which separates the flow subsystems of the two confined aquifers. Water
   that reaches the Lloyd aquifer attains traveltimes as high as 10,000
   years, whereas water that has not penetrated deeper than the Magothy
   aquifer attains traveltimes of only 2,000 years. The finite-element
   approach used in this study is particularly suited to ground-water
   systems that have complex hydrostratigraphy and cross-sectional
   symmetry.}},

Abstract = {{Interests in the development and protection of ground water have had
   unbalanced thrusts through the years, focusing on special types of

   Of special importance are the needs for optimal use of existing
   experience and data and for strengthening the hydrogeologic experience
   at policy and regulatory levels. At hand are (1) great piles of
   hydrogeologic data, some unneeded, (2) widely varying background
   knowledge and varying experience of workers, and (3) types and ranges of
   uncertainties. To make optimal use of available data and knowledge, to
   handle uncertainties, and to properly integrate the hydrogeologic
   conditions with other factors, there should be risk-based approaches in
   a decision analysis framework. Better balanced efforts toward future
   ground-water protection and management can be realized by incorporating
   features of the suggested framework approach.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, numerical methods are used to examine the capillary
   fringe hypothesis proposed by Nwankwor et al. (1992) to explain
   variations in the storage property of an unconfined aquifer during
   pumping. Based on field observations, the hypothesis suggested that the
   response of an unconfined aquifer to the stress imposed by pumping is
   largely controlled by the magnitude of vertical hydraulic gradients
   developed above the moving water table. After validation with a 1-D
   hysteretic laboratory experiment and a 2-D axisymmetric variably
   saturated semianalytical model, the numerical solution was used to
   simulate the pumping test of Nwankwor et al. (1992). Numerical
   parameters used for the simulation were chosen from experiments
   independent of the pumping test. There was good agreement between
   numerical results and field data at different depths and different
   radial distances from the pumping well. Numerically obtained variations
   in the magnitude of vertical gradients above the water table and the
   resulting variations in values of apparent specific yield also showed
   similar trends with the field data. The good agreement between the
   numerical and field results provides convincing evidence that the field
   observations and the resulting capillary fringe hypothesis concerning
   time variations of specific yield, are indeed consistent with the
   physical principles of variably saturated flow. The high storativity
   values frequently obtained by fitting early-time data to type curves
   were shown to correspond to the period of increasing hydraulic
   gradients, and may not be related to intrinsic properties of the
   aquifer, such as compressibility. In agreement with the ``volume-balance
   method{''} of Nwankwor et al. (1984), it was also shown that the results
   confirm that the ultimate specific yield of an unconfined aquifer is
   more related to the drainable porosity than the low values often
   obtained from type-curve analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A calibrated, two-dimensional, finite-element transport model of the
   dolomite aquifer of the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin is used to ascertain
   the mass loadings of chloride and nitrate delivered to Lake Michigan and
   Green Bay by ground water. Inclusion of unsteady transport effects and
   verification of the model have not been possible due to data
   limitations. With that caveat, the model shows that only 43, 33, and
   38\% of the water, chloride, and nitrate, respectively, entering the
   aquifer's upper surface as recharge actually discharges directly to the
   lake as ground water. The remainder is discharged to wells and other
   sinks beforehand. A concentration of agricultural and urban land use
   sources along the Green Bay coast results in 58 and 50\% of the total
   chloride and nitrate, respectively, delivered by ground water going to
   the west shore, despite that side's receiving only 38\% of the water
   volume. On the Lake Michigan side, agricultural land use is the largest
   source of both chemicals, with the second largest source from background
   contributions. Point sources are relatively minor contributors of both
   chemicals.
   In an earlier paper, Cherkauer and McKereghan (1991) showed that
   ground-water discharge was focussed into embayments along the shore.
   That phenomenon repeats itself in solute loads as the greatest mass
   discharges occur in the bays. The simulated results show that discharge
   to both bays and nonbays on a given coast have similar solute
   concentrations, so the load differences are strictly the result of
   discharge focussing.
   Ground water's delivery of the solutes to these bays generally greatly
   exceeds that from precipitation. Comparison of loading to other sources
   or to mass budgets for the entire lake is not possible at this time.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical, semianalytical, and numerical models of the flow system in a
   stratified-drift buried-valley aquifer were used with
   particle-tracking/stream-function programs to delineate
   traveltime-related capture zones of a municipal wellfield and to assess
   conceptual errors imposed by requisite assumptions associated with each
   flow model. The analytical flow model uses the Theis equation describing
   two-dimensional transient drawdown surrounding a well in a fully
   confined aquifer and superposition of a nonuniform regional flow field.
   The semianalytical flow model implicitly uses the Thiem equation
   describing two-dimensional steady-state drawdown surrounding a well in a
   fully confined aquifer and superposition of a uniform regional flow
   field. The numerical flow model uses a three-dimensional steady-state
   finite-difference solution and incorporates four model layers,
   specified-flux and head-dependent flux boundary conditions, spatially
   variable recharge, and head-dependent leakage to and from streams.
   The predictive ability of the flow models is based on comparison of mean
   absolute errors and root mean squared errors between measured and
   simulated heads as well as comparison of pathline distributions defining
   the one-year capture zones. The comparisons show that the uniform flow
   field and uniform transmissivity required of the semianalytical flow
   model cause it to be less accurate than the analytical and numerical
   flow models. The inability of the analytical flow model to incorporate
   spatial variations in transmissivity causes it to be less accurate than
   the numerical flow model. These conceptual errors associated with use of
   the analytical and semianalytical flow models in this hydrogeologic
   setting cause their one-year capture zones to be less reasonable than
   those from the numerical flow model.}},

Abstract = {{Sinkhole development affects approximately 15 percent of the land area
   of the world. Development of new sinkholes is extremely site-specific,
   but general associations between new sinkhole development and
   hydrogeologic factors can be established for areas with adequate
   historical records of sinkhole development. In the Orlando area,
   east-central Florida, at least 140 sinkholes have developed between 1961
   and 1986. The Orlando area is situated on a thickly mantled karst area,
   and sinkholes form by cover collapse or, less commonly, cover
   subsidence. On the average, 11 new sinkholes collapse each year. The
   mean diameter is 30.8 feet and the mean depth is 15.5 feet. Eighty-five
   percent of the new sinkholes occur in high recharge areas (10 to 15
   inches/year) on slightly elevated, sandy ridges. Few or no sinkholes
   occur in discharge areas where net downward erosion of surficial
   sediment is very unlikely. Forty-two percent of all new sinkholes occur
   during April and May when ground-water levels are usually at seasonal
   low stands. When the potentiometric surface declines 5 feet below its
   mode, then more sinkholes than expected per unit time begin to occur.
   When the potentiometric surface declines 10 feet below its mode, then
   more than 10 times as many sinkholes as expected per unit time begin to
   occur. Management of ground-water withdrawal to avoid drawdowns in
   excess of 5 feet in sinkhole-prone areas will minimize new sinkhole
   development induced by man.}},

Abstract = {{A mathematical model and calculation method were developed in this study
   for steady-state flow in an aquifer-horizontal well system under a water
   reservoir without the usual assumption about interface conditions that
   the specific discharge in the radial direction to the screen is constant
   along its axis.
   A horizontal well (i.e. drain, gallery, or lateral) is represented as a
   linear sink with nonuniform intensity for description of a flow in an
   aquifer. Flow in the screen channels is described by taking into account
   energy losses and the momentum flux change along the well screen's axial
   orifice. Substantial errors are avoided by the use of the proposed
   model.
   The mathematical model also can be used for the analysis of vertical
   wells.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{945-957}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional (3-D), advection-based numerical model has been
   developed for simulating two-well injection withdrawal tracer tests in
   heterogeneous granular aquifers, and the model has been applied to
   perform various simulations of an actual two-well tracer test conducted
   previously in a confined aquifer at a field site near Mobile, Alabama.
   Information obtained from a series of independent field tests is used as
   input in the model to account for the 3-D spatial distribution of the
   hydraulic conductivity (K) at the test site.
   The numerical model is based on a simplified, Lagrangian approach in
   which the transport of the tracer between the injection and withdrawal
   wells is modeled taking into account advection only. Processes such as
   dispersion, sorption, and chemical or biological reactions are
   neglected. Despite field data limitations and various simplifying
   assumptions, the model predictions of the withdrawal-well concentration
   breakthrough and of the mean tracer arrival times at various levels of
   two multilevel observation wells are in good overall agreement with the
   corresponding field observations.
   The results of this study indicate that it will be possible to construct
   realistic, predictive models of contaminant transport in heterogeneous
   granular aquifers if the necessary effort is made to obtain field
   measurements of the 3-D spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity.
   The extent and feasibility of such an effort are expected to depend on
   the particular contamination problem at hand. Future research should be
   directed toward the problems of field measurement scale selection and
   the development of K distributions for models from sparse data sets.}},

Abstract = {{A two-well tracer experiment was conducted in a coastal, sandy aquifer
   in South Carolina to investigate tracer migration in ground-water
   systems. Chloride tracer was injected into the aquifer under a steady
   flow condition created by continuous injection and withdrawal of ground
   water at an injection and a withdrawal well dipole separated by a
   distance of 5 meters. Breakthrough data were collected at several depths
   from two multilevel sampling wells, 1.5 meters apart, between the
   injection well and the withdrawal well.
   A one-dimensional advection-dispersion model that considers the
   nonuniform velocity field of the two-well experiment was employed to
   estimate the hydrologic properties of the aquifer. The values of the
   porosity and dispersivity were estimated by fitting the model to the
   observed breakthrough data collected at three depths at one sampling
   well (Well A). These values were then used to predict the breakthroughs
   at the same depths in the other sampling well (Well B). A
   two-dimensional flow and transport model was also employed to simulate
   the tracer migration. Results of both one- and two-dimensional
   simulations show that these models fail to predict the tracer
   breakthrough at Well B using parameter values obtained from Well A.
   The failure of the model to predict breakthroughs at Well B suggests
   that a three-dimensional characterization of aquifer heterogeneities and
   a three-dimensional modeling effort may be needed in order to capture
   the complex flow pattern in the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{In 1989, the Four County Landfill (FCL) in Fulton County, Indiana was
   closed by a federal judge because of regulatory violations and its
   threat to the environment. As part of the litigation, a ground-water
   flow modeling study was performed on behalf of a group of concerned
   citizens. Time constraints and, even more importantly, budgetary
   constraints called for an approach which could be implemented quickly
   and would yield meaningful results without additional field data
   acquisition. The modeling was performed with the relatively new analytic
   element method.
   The new method employs superposition of closed form analytic solutions,
   rather than a grid or element network, and proved an effective tool in
   answering some unresolved hydrogeological questions. The study results
   demonstrate substantially higher regional and local hydraulic
   conductivities than suggested by the landfill consultants,
   well-connected upper and lower aquifer zones at the site, and potential
   ground-water travel times from the landfill to the nearby Tippecanoe
   River of less than 15 years.}},

Title = {{TRACER TEST EVALUATION OF A DRAINAGE DITCH CAPTURE ZONE}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{667-675}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Recent analytical and numerical modeling studies (Zheng et al., 1988a,
   1988b) suggest that drainage ditches within the central sand plain of
   Wisconsin may serve to limit the spread of agricultural chemicals. In
   this study a natural-gradient tracer test was conducted to determine
   flow paths around a sand plain drainage ditch. The flow paths define a
   capture zone for the ditch. These results were used to evaluate the
   predictive capabilities of an analytical model (Zheng et al., 1988a).
   The natural-gradient tracer test began with injections of iodide at two
   depths and bromide at an intermediate depth. Movement of these tracers
   reveals that average ground-water velocity ranged from 0.4 ft/day at a
   depth of 20 ft to greater than 1 ft/day near the water table. The
   delineated capture zone was deeper than 12 ft below the water table.
   These results are encouraging because they indicate that the capture
   depth of the ditch should allow for the effective removal of shallow
   agricultural contaminants. The observed capture depth falls within the
   range predicted by the analytical model of Zheng et al. (1988a).
   However, a sensitivity analysis of the analytical method reveals that
   the predicted range of capture depths is large. This range results from
   the variability and uncertainty of the model parameters. The analytical
   solution appears best suited for estimating the minimum capture depth,
   which is a conservative estimate of contaminant capture.}},

Abstract = {{The chemical and biochemical composition of leaf tissue from 24
   mezquites (Prosopis articulata) was correlated with the ion content of
   soils and ground waters from six separate sites supporting plant growth.
   The peroxidase responses varied at different salinities; however, this
   enzyme activity decreased as the electrical conductivity of the ground
   water increased. Chlorophyll content of the leaves increased with the
   electrical conductivity (EC) of the well water, but the response was not
   statistically significant. The ion concentration (Ca++, Mg++, Na+,
   HCO3-, and Cl-), pH, and SAR (sodium adsorption ratio) in leaf tissue
   showed no correlation with their corresponding values for soil and
   ground water, confirming earlier reports on the ion-exclusion mechanism
   of the mezquite root system. Likewise, low molecular weight metabolites
   such as glycerol, amino acids, and hexoses showed no correspondence with
   the salt content in ground waters. Of all the studied ions, chemical
   parameters, and biochemical compounds, EC in the ground water, leaves,
   and soil in the open field midway between mezquites, as well as
   peroxidase activity of foliar extracts showed the highest correlation
   with the salinity of ground water. The results of this research suggest
   that measuring EC and biochemical mezquite parameters may provide an
   alternative to drilling to evaluate ground-water quality.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-two collector wells were constructed from existing large-diameter
   wells dug in weathered hard rock (regolith) areas of the northern Dry
   Zone of Sri Lanka. A collector well is constructed by drilling 30 m long
   horizontal adits from the base of the dug well so as to exploit the
   permeable layer of the regolith, which lies just above the zone of
   slightly weathered rock. Across the North-Central Province of the
   island, the water table commonly lies within the regolith for most of
   the year enabling dug wells to yield water. The generally poor yield of
   these wells and the occasional dry well has resulted in this aquifer
   being largely neglected by developers with most recent efforts going
   into the construction of many slim boreholes.
   The objectives of this work were: (1) to enhance the yields from
   suitable dug wells, (2) to observe the variation in yield improvement
   for wells with different constructions and in varying geologic and
   hydrogeologic environments, and (3) to monitor the performance of the
   converted wells throughout the dry season.
   The project has demonstrated that, on average, the conversion of a dug
   well to a collector well more than doubles the yield of ground water and
   that these yields are sustainable throughout the dry season. Safe yields
   from these wells average an equivalent continuous yield of 60 m3/day,
   assuming a 100 day dry period.}},

Abstract = {{This paper revisits a long-standing problem in aquifer analysis. In
   particular, it provides a physically consistent explanation of the
   characteristic time-drawdown response of unconfined sand or gravel
   aquifers to pumping. It also provides a physical explanation for the low
   values of specific yield commonly obtained by type-curve matching
   procedures. Tensiometers and piezometers distributed throughout the
   saturated thickness were used to monitor, in great detail, the hydraulic
   response of an unconfined sand aquifer to pumping. A gamma moisture
   gauge and core samples were also used to obtain measurements of water
   content in the region of the declining water table. The results showed
   the early period of time-drawdown graphs to correspond with the period
   of increasing gradients. Excess storage of water was observed above the
   water table and was shown to be a necessary consequence of the vertical
   hydraulic gradients and the water-content/pressure-head relationship for
   the aquifer material. The excess storage decreased during the period of
   decreasing vertical gradients. The period of delayed drawdown was shown
   to be the result of the decline in excess storage. Contrary to most of
   the recent literature, the results show that drainage processes above
   the water table have a very significant effect on the response of
   unconfined aquifers to pumping. The results indicate further that the
   normal methods of analyzing time-drawdown curves for unconfined aquifers
   give excessively high values of storativity and values of specific yield
   that are unrealistically low.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive assessment of the environmental impact of a full-scale,
   operating overland flow (OLF) land treatment system was made at the
   Campbell Soup (Texas), Inc. facility in Paris, Texas. The system treats
   over 16,000 m3/d of waste water and has been in operation for over 25
   years. Field samples of soil, waste water, OLF runoff, and ground water
   collected during the study and detailed long-term process records
   maintained by Campbell Soup were used as part of the evaluation.
   Geochemical data indicated that sulfate-chloride facies were dominant
   for the ground water collected at the OLF site. Field data and
   calculations indicated that the evapotranspirative concentration of
   salts in the applied waste water would be insufficient to produce the
   measured concentrations in the ground water. A pattern of increasing
   ionic concentration over time (1968 to 1989) with small changes in ionic
   ratios suggested a trend toward the dissolution and concentration of
   naturally present minerals (such as gypsum and sodium chloride) in the
   slow moving ground water. Predictions made with the aid of MINTEQA2, a
   thermodynamic equilibrium model, indicated that precipitation of
   carbonates and simultaneous ion exchange on clays could represent a
   significant mechanism for the removal of calcium and magnesium from
   solution and the addition of sodium. The development of a slightly
   saline, semiconfined aquifer was strongly suggested by the ground-water
   geochemical data, soil data, the estimated rate of infiltration, field
   hydraulic conductivity, MINTEQA2 model predictions and the magnitude of
   the volume of waste water applied.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of the implementation of nutrient management practices on
   ground-water quality were studied at a 55-acre farm in Lancaster County,
   Pennsylvania, from 1985-90. After nutrient management practices were
   implemented at the site in October 1986, statistically significant
   decreases (Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test) in median nitrate concentrations
   in ground-water samples occurred at four of the five wells monitored.
   The largest decreases in nitrate concentration occurred in samples
   collected at the wells that had the largest nitrate concentrations prior
   to nutrient management. The decreases in median nitrate concentrations
   in ground-water samples ranged from 8 to 32 percent of the median
   concentrations prior to nutrient management and corresponded to nitrogen
   application decreases of 39 to 67 percent in contributing areas that
   were defined upgradient of these wells.
   Changes in nitrogen applications to the contributing areas of five water
   wells were correlated (Spearman rank-sum test) with nitrate
   concentrations of the well water. Changes in ground-water nitrate
   concentrations lagged behind the changes in applied-nitrogen fertilizers
   (primarily manure) by approximately 4 to 19 months.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{731-742}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations are performed to investigate quantitatively
   density effects of a contaminant plume on its movement in time and
   space. The numerical model used is a characteristics/finite difference
   method. The density of the solute is described by an equation of state
   similar to sea water or lead nitrate. The results of a large number of
   simulations do not allow us to establish a general empirical law for
   predicting the fate of a density-dependent plume. Whether density
   effects are important or not depends on a variety of hydraulic
   parameters of the aquifer model, such as the permeability (isotropic or
   anisotropic), flow gradient, the hydrodynamic dispersivity, and the
   time-scale considered. Following some theoretical ideas of previously
   derived analytical scaling laws for buoyant plumes, the concept of a
   near-source and a far-source region of the plume has been found very
   useful. The modeled plume centerlines compare favorably with the
   predictions of these scaling laws in the intermediate-source region, but
   deviate significantly in the far-source region where diffusion processes
   become important or necking instabilities at the plume edges occur. It
   is found that the combined influence of the various model parameters
   above can be very different, depending on whether the plume is still
   within the near-source or has already extended into the far-source
   region. In spite of the large dependency of the density effects on these
   model parameters, in some cases variable density might have an effect on
   the plume migration for already moderate density contrasts of
   approximately 0.3\% (which corresponds to a concentration of
   approximately 4000 ppm for a leachate of salt or lead nitrate).
   Hydrodynamic dispersion tends to reduce the density effects. For
   sufficiently small values of the dispersivity, convective instabilities
   and fingering phenomena occur at the horizontal plume boundaries. For a
   lighter-than-water contaminant, such as acetone or methylethylketone,
   significant buoyant movements occur only for (unrealistically) high
   concentration of approximately 20,000 ppm. In conclusion the results of
   the simulations do not provide a generally applicable guideline for the
   evaluation of density-dependence transport. Therefore, the individual
   numerical modeling of a particular site will often be indispensable.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water in the Red River Valley region of North Dakota evolves from
   HCO3 to SO4 to Cl-type water over a distance of less than 100 km.
   Pathline analysis of ground-water flow in a transect across the valley
   combined with chemical equilibrium and mass balance relationships
   explain the processes responsible for the observed geochemical
   evolution. Prior geological studies have shown that the central Red
   River Valley is a discharge zone for regional ground-water flow.
   Discharged waters are generated from different sources, processes, and
   pathlines. Closed surface drainage and small permeability provide
   Na-HCO3 Water for bedrock recharge on the western side of the transect.
   In contrast, greater recharge in shale outwash is characterized by
   Ca-Mg-HCO3 water. Both ultimately evolve to SO4 water with similar
   proportions of major cations. Upward flow through Paleozoic sediments
   into the Lower Cretaceous Inyan Kam Group consists of Na-Cl water
   modified by downward leakage Of SO4 Water from Cretaceous shale and
   HCO3-SO4 water from glacial sediments. Discharged ground water reveals
   chemical characteristics that suggest mixing of spatially varying
   proportions of local recharge and more evolved, deeper ground water.
   Mineral/ground-water equilibria and estimation of mass transfer indicate
   that ground-water composition is largely controlled by carbonate
   precipitation and dissolution, gypsum dissolution, and clay cation
   exchange.}},

Abstract = {{A computer-assisted flow net analysis technique was developed and
   evaluated using a hypothetical heterogeneous aquifer with spatially
   variable recharge. Flow nets were derived and analyzed for cases with
   differing piezometric observation density and accuracy. Using a
   criterion to determine a best approximation to the observed piezometric
   surface, the transmissivity distributions implied by fitted surfaces
   were compared with the known true transmissivities. Where an optimum
   approximation to the piezometric surface was clearly defined, the
   resulting computed transmissivities compared favorably with the known
   values. With sparse or inaccurate observations, ft became increasingly
   difficult to identify an optimum solution. ne experiments illustrate
   some of the difficulties inherent in the ground-water inverse problem
   and the flow net analysis method. Application of the method to real
   field cases has yet to be tested.}},

Abstract = {{A vertical circulation well is a well completed in two intervals with
   extraction induced in one interval and injection induced in the other,
   generating a circulating flow field near the well. A vertical
   circulation well may be used to remediate contaminated ground water by
   air stripping the extracted water and then reinjecting the clean water;
   by introducing oxygen and/or nutrients to the extracted water before
   reinjecting ft, thereby stimulating the natural bioremediation of the
   water; or by injecting appropriate chemicals or microbes, effecting
   remediation of the circulated water. This paper summarizes an analytical
   technique for predicting the steady-state hydraulic head and flow fields
   caused by the operation of multiple vertical circulation wells in a
   confined aquifer with a regional gradient. The method begins with the
   hydraulic head solution for a point sink in an infinite aquifer. The
   point sink is then integrated to derive the solution for a line sink.
   Linear superposition is applied to obtain the hydraulic head resulting
   from multiple line sinks and sources in a homogeneous confined aquifer.
   This solution is then differentiated to obtain the hydraulic head
   gradient and three-dimensional velocity field. The velocity field is
   numerically integrated by an adaptive Runge-Kutta scheme to obtain the
   pathlines of three-dimensional flow.}},

Abstract = {{The buildup of nitrates in upper ground-water zones is a potential
   cumulative effect of on-site sewage disposal practices which is not
   addressed by standard siting and design criteria Literature concerning
   the contribution and fate of nitrogen beneath septic tank disposal
   fields is reviewed. From these findings, convenient, simplified methods
   are developed for estimating long-term ground-water nitrate increases on
   an area-wide basis. The methods are presented in a manner useful to
   engineers, planners, and regulatory agencies for routine evaluation of
   existing and proposed land developments and for design of large, common
   disposal systems. Typical solutions are shown graphically to illustrate
   the relative importance of various factors, including development
   density, rainfall recharge, and soil denitrification. Predicted values
   are compared with actual monitoring data for three California
   communities to verify the reasonableness of the suggested methods.
   Several possible regulatory applications are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for aerobic biotransformation of the herbicides
   MCPP{[}(+/-)-2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionic acid] and Atrazine
   {[}2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-triazine] under natural
   aquifer conditions was investigated. A natural gradient experiment was
   carried out in an aerobic ground-water zone at the Canadian Forces Base
   Borden, Borden, Ontario, Canada. Over 90 days, a continuous plume was
   created by weekly injections of the herbicides (average concentrations
   of 400-mu-g/l each), together with a conservative tracer, chloride. The
   fate of the herbicides was monitored at multilevel piezometers located
   downgradient from the injection well. In parallel, experiments with in
   situ testers (Gillham et al., 1990) were set up in the aquifer and
   microcosms were set up in the laboratory.
   For MCPP, the natural gradient experiment showed an adaptation period of
   42-56 days followed by transformation from 400 to 30-mu-g/l. As
   predicted, MCPP was not retarded compared to the conservative tracer. No
   transformation was observed in the in situ testers over 47 days. In the
   laboratory experiments no transformation was observed over 74 days.
   Atrazine was recalcitrant within the experimental period of 96 days in
   the natural gradient experiment. A retardation factor R = 1.2, within
   the predicted range, was found for Atrazine in the Borden aquifer. No
   transformation was observed either in the in situ testers or in the
   laboratory experiments after a period of 96 and 74 days, respectively.
   These results suggest that both MCPP and Atrazine are mobile in sand
   aquifers. Atrazine appears persistent, at least for 96 days, while MCPP
   undergoes considerable transformation.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Before urban development, most ground-water recharge on Long Island, New
   York, occurred during the dormant season, when evapotranspiration is
   low. The use of recharge basins for collection and disposal of urban
   storm runoff in Nassau County has enabled ground-water recharge to occur
   also during the growing season. In contrast, the use of storm sewers to
   route storm runoff to streams and coastal waters has resulted in a
   decrease in ground-water recharge during the dormant season. The net
   result of these two forms of urban storm-runoff control has been an
   increase in annual recharge of about 12 percent in areas served by
   recharge basins and a decrease of about 10 percent in areas where storm
   runoff is routed to streams and tidewater. On a countywide basis, annual
   ground-water recharge has remained nearly the same as under
   predevelopment conditions, but its distribution pattern has changed.
   Redistribution resulted in increased recharge in the eastern and central
   parts of the county, and decreased recharge in the western and nearshore
   areas. Model simulation of recharge indicates that the water-table
   altitude has increased by as much as 5 ft above predevelopment levels in
   areas served by recharge basins and declined by as much as 3 feet in
   areas where stormwater is discharged to streams and tidewater.}},

Abstract = {{A parameter estimation procedure which determines the coefficients of
   soil hydraulic equations (soil-water characteristic and hydraulic
   conductivity curves) is developed. The parameters are determined by
   nonlinear least-squares regression of steady-state water potential

   to an equation, herein derived, which describes water potential
   continuously along the column. To estimate parameter values, total mass
   of water in the soil column at steady-state, saturated water content,
   and steady-state flow rate must also be measured.
   The parameter estimation procedure is verified using synthetic data and
   is applied in the laboratory. The coefficients appearing in the van
   Genuchten and Campbell soil hydraulic equations are estimated by the
   procedure. Alternative methodologies are proposed to augment this
   procedure and to provide user flexibility. The coefficients in the
   difficult-to-measure wet range can be determined from measurements taken

Abstract = {{A simple method for computing transmissivity and storativity from the
   analysis of observaton-well response during constant-head aquifer tests
   is presented. The proposed methodology is based on approximate solutions
   developed using the Boltzmann transformation technique, and is
   demonstrated to be valid for many practical situations. It is shown that
   familiar constant-rate solutions (e.g., the Theis equation) can be
   generalized for the constant-head case if the head change at the
   observation well is normalized by the flow rate at the test well and
   then used as the time-dependent variable. A generalized form of the
   Jacob-Lohman approximation which is valid at every point in the aquifer
   is presented. Analysis of several hypothetical constant-head test data
   using the suggested approach indicate that estimates of transmissivity
   are much more reliable than those of storativity. However, both
   hydraulic parameters appear to be reasonably estimated if the interwell
   distance is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the wellbore
   radius.}},

Abstract = {{Glacial till overlies many bedrock aquifers in Iowa, and a number of
   landfills and leaking underground storage tank sites are located in
   weathered and unweathered till. To investigate the potential for
   significant lateral ground-water flow in Wisconsin age weathered loam
   till in Iowa, two 24-hour pumping tests were performed in the shallow
   unconfined ground water present in the weathered till, a constant
   flowrate pumping test and a constant drawdown pumping test. The
   saturated thickness in the weathered till at the research site is less
   than 3 m, and choosing a constant flowrate sufficient for significant
   drawdown in the monitoring wells without dewatering the pumping well was
   difficult. In a low conductivity medium with a thin saturated thickness,
   the constant drawdown pumping test was found to be a more practical
   field technique. In the constant drawdown test, a chosen level of
   constant drawdown is maintained in the pumping well for the duration of
   pumping, and the flowrate decreases with time. The changing flowrate of
   the constant drawdown pumping test was approximated as a series of step
   decreases, and superposition of the Theis solution was used for
   simulation. Both types of pumping tests yielded similar parameter
   estimates for the weathered loam till region in Iowa, with an average
   bulk horizontal hydraulic conductivity of around 5 X 10(-4) cm/s and an
   average specific yield of about 0.032. Single well response (bail) tests
   produced comparable estimates for hydraulic conductivity, with a mean of
   3 X 10(-4) cm/s. The results imply significant lateral ground-water flow
   is possible, and the weathered till should not be considered a
   significant barrier to the lateral spread of shallow ground-water
   contamination.}},

Abstract = {{Determinations of Cl-36 (T1/2 = 301,000 a) in waters on and near the
   U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina
   reveal that nuclear fuel reprocessing activities there have released
   measurable amounts of this radionuclide to the environment. The natural
   atmospheric flux of Cl-36 at the latitude of SRS is 20-25 atoms m-2
   sec-1. Atmospheric releases of Cl-36 from SRS, within the site
   boundaries, have increased this flux by a factor of at least 10 to 20.
   Approximately 3 X 10(9) Becquerels (Bq) {[}84 millicuries (mCi)] of
   site-derived Cl-36 have been deposited within 200 km of the plant
   boundaries. By comparison, fallout of Cl-36 from nuclear weapons testing
   in the 1950s deposited twice this amount of activity in the same area.
   Surface-water Cl-36, Concentrations in on-site streams represent about
   0.01 percent of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) drinking-water
   standard and therefore pose no health concern. At SRS and similar
   facilities, this additional source of Cl-36 should prove useful for
   validating ground-water and atmospheric transport models.}},

Abstract = {{In order to determine the suitability of bromide as a surrogate for
   tritium for ground-water tracing in fractured and fissured dolomite,
   apparent relative retardation coefficients of bromide with respect to
   tritium were computed by the cumulative relative mass-time method from
   breakthrough curves of both substances, when used simultaneously as
   tracers in a two-well recirculating tracer test. Throughout the
   33.78-day test, relative retardation differences of only a few
   hundredths were detected for most of the testing time.
   Tritium was less retarded in flow through highly transmissive openings
   than in more diffuse flow. Bromide was generally retarded relative to
   tritium except at the pumping well where the concentrations of both were
   diluted an order of magnitude below those in the monitoring wells, and
   tritium was retarded slightly more than bromide.
   Apparent relative retardation was found to change with transmissivity,
   concentration, flow-path length and time, but not enough to rule out
   bromide as a suitable surrogate for, or even better than, tritium in
   dolomite if the limitations of each tracer are known.}},

Abstract = {{Sloping clay layers beneath percolation ponds can cause infiltrating
   waste water to pond and move in directions not predicted by vertical
   infiltration equations. This paper presents a method for estimating the
   potential of percolation sumps located over sloping clay layers to
   interact with nearby ground-water resources. The analytical solution
   developed is for steady-state conditions and includes a procedure to
   estimate the time needed to reach steady state. The fundamental
   assumption used in the mathematical development requires that
   elevation-head gradients be much larger than pressure-head gradients. A
   method for testing the validity of this assumption is also included. An
   example calculation was performed for percolation sumps on the Naval
   Petroleum Reserves No. 1 in Elk Hills, California. That analysis shows
   that under the assumptions used, a sump exclusion zone on the Elk Hills
   is required to protect ground-water resources within the adjacent San

Abstract = {{Volume calculations in various aspects of ground-water resources
   evaluation play a significant role. However, these calculations are made
   by different classical techniques, each of which employs the finite
   element concept. A common requirement in these techniques is the
   adaptation of a basic height-like contour interval. The accuracy of the
   estimated volume is influenced by the subjectivity on the part of the
   person doing the contouring on a specified contour interval. It is
   observed that there is a linear relationship between the contour
   interval and the estimated volume. The basic idea of this paper is to
   use a simple drawing procedure of a few points of different contour
   intervals versus the resulting volumes. A regression line is fitted
   through the scatter of these points. The best volume estimate
   corresponds to zero contour interval, i.e., the intercept of the
   straight line with the volume axis. This technique provides a common
   basis in that different researchers arrive at exactly the same
   conclusion for a given data set. The proposed method is verified by
   calculating the reservoir volume of a laboratory dam model with the
   known reservoir volume. It was found that the estimated volume was off
   by only 5\% of the measured one. Further applications of the method are
   given for some observed data from the Floridan aquifer and a Black Hills
   dam reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{In the design of new waste-management facilities, or in the remedial
   design for contaminated facilities, there are economic tradeoffs
   possible between the resources assigned to site investigation, facility
   design, and site monitoring. Hydrogeological decision analysis provides
   a framework that allows a sequential, iterative approach to design, in
   which data acquisition through site investigation alternates with
   economic analysis of alternative design options. In this framework, the
   purpose of collecting hydrogeological data is to aid in the making of
   decisions between the alternative design options. Such decisions are
   made on the basis of a risk-cost-benefit objective function. Additional
   measurements have worth only if the risk reduction they provide exceeds
   the cost of obtaining them. The location of measurement points in a
   site-investigation network should minimize economic regret with respect
   to design decisions. This paper provides an introduction to the concepts
   of data-worth analysis for two cases: (1) the reduction of uncertainty
   in aquitard continuity, and (2) the reduction of uncertainty in
   hydraulic-conductivity distribution in an aquifer. It is shown how the
   use of search theory and Bayesian updating can be applied in comparing
   prior and preposterior analyses to provide a stopping rule for the
   collection of additional data in site investigation programs at a
   hypothetical landfill site.}},

Abstract = {{A ground-water flow and contaminant transport modeling study was
   performed at a proposed waste disposal site on the Department of
   Energy's Oak Ridge Reservation to assess the accuracy of a computer
   simulation of the flow field in the shallow water-table aquifer. The
   migration of a ground-water tracer, under controlled field conditions,
   was used as a comparative benchmark of solute transport simulations
   assuming different aquifer characteristics. A conventional approach to
   aquifer analysis and modeling, which assumed the domain to be
   homogeneous with low anisotropy, resulted in an inaccurate simulation of
   tracer migration. Alternative conceptual models were formulated which
   considered the effects of geologic heterogeneities on tracer migration
   which could be verified by additional data acquisition and analysis.
   Application of the alternative concepts in numerical modeling resulted
   in more accurate simulations of tracer migration. These results
   suggested that local geology created discrete flow pathways oriented
   oblique to the maximum gradient which were unresolved in conventional
   aquifer analysis. Results of the study showed that standard approaches
   to aquifer analysis and computer modeling are crudely representative of
   the flow field and provide nonconservative estimates of contaminant
   transport at the scale of a waste disposal unit. By adopting an
   iterative approach to site characterization, conceptual model
   formulation, and numerical modeling, the level of resolution provided by
   a ground-water tracer was accurately simulated.}},

Abstract = {{The northern Negev desert has become a prime area for siting potentially
   contaminating facilities, including chemical industries and the Israeli
   national site for isolation and treatment of hazardous waste. The area
   is underlain by chalk formations having low matrix permeability.
   However, abundant fractures create preferential pathways for contaminant
   migration from the land surface to ground water in the chalk aquitard
   and, possibly, to adjacent aquifers. Geologic investigations preceding
   the construction of these industries assumed that the combination of the
   arid climate and low matrix permeability of the aquitard was sufficient
   to prevent any contaminant movement into its ground water. Solute
   transport through fractures and dissolution channels was never
   considered. However, contamination has been recently observed in the
   aquitard. Observations regarding the seasonal fluctuation of
   ground-water levels, oxygen-18 and deuterium composition, and the
   measurable tritium (0.3 to 15.9 TU) provide the basis for the following
   conclusions: (1) Ground-water recharge by winter precipitation and
   runoff water occurs rapidly despite the regions's aridity and the low
   permeability of the overlying chalk matrix, (2) recharge occurs along
   fractures in all regions and is not restricted to hydrologically
   upgradient areas, and (3) recently recharged water is being mixed with
   the base flow of older water. Older ground water may flow along smaller,
   less developed fracture systems or through the porous matrix, whereas
   recent water probably moves along wider fractures or karst channels
   formed underneath ephemeral streams.}},

Title = {{EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF GROUND-WATER FROM THE STONE FOREST KARST
   AQUIFERS OF SOUTH CHINA}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{324-330}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Stone forest aquifers are the most widely exploited sources for ground
   water in the vast south China karst belt.  These aquifers occupy a thin
   epikarst zone that has been infilled with clastic sediments.  The
   aquifers are characterized by large lateral permeabilities and small
   reservoir capacities owing to their thinness.  The carbonate rocks which
   comprise the framework for the aquifers are usually buried under the
   karst plains and large karst depressions where development is desired.
   The stone forest aquifer exploration procedure must first locate
   saturated zones.  Second, those parts of the saturated zone having the
   greatest dissolution porosity must be identified because the infilled
   dissolution voids contain the water.
   The best indicators of saturation include the combination of low
   topography and the presence of active karst features such as springs,
   karst windows (natural openings exposing the water table), and live
   surface streams.  These elements are readily observed on intermediate
   scale (1:20,000) aerial photography.
   The depth and degree of carbonate dissolution porosity is a function of
   several geologic and hydrologic factors including carbonate rock type,
   carbonate purity, fracture density, specific discharge, age of the
   circulation system, etc.  These variables cannot be measured directly
   because the carbonate rocks are usually buried under a thin mantle of
   clastic sediments.  However, if it is recognized that the ground-water
   system has already exploited the most favorable geology and that
   dissolution is an ongoing process, a simple indirect method can be used
   to identify the areas having the greatest porosity.  The presence of
   karst depressions and recent sinkholes are indicative of the most
   intensely karstified and hydraulically active parts of the epikarst
   zone.  Mapping of these surface features from stereo aerial photography
   is a simple geomorphology exercise that can be used to directly identify
   the most favorable well sites.
   Current well construction practices in the south China karst belt
   involve both dug and drilled wells.  Dug wells are preferred in many
   locations owing to both cost-effectiveness associated with cheap labor
   and lack of available drilling equipment.  The dug wells look and
   function identically to karst windows and thus conform to timeless water
   use traditions in the region.}},

Title = {{USING COOPER-JACOB APPROXIMATION TO TAKE ACCOUNT OF PUMPING WELL PIPE
   STORAGE EFFECTS IN EARLY DRAWDOWN DATA OF A CONFINED AQUIFER}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{331-337}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Most hydrogeology textbooks warn the reader that in order to avoid large
   errors the Cooper-Jacob solution should only be applied when the
   u-parameter of the Theis solution is less than 0.01 or 0.02.  This paper
   proposes a graphical representation for visualizing and quantifying the
   difference between the two solutions.  The graph of drawdown vs log
   (time) may be divided into three zones, the early one being influenced
   by storativity, pumping well pipe capacity and skin effects (among
   others), the latest by boundary effects, and the intermediate one by the
   transmissivity and storativity of the aquifer.  The differences between
   the theoretical solutions are maximal in the early data zone.  Because
   both solutions consider a pumping well of infinitesimal diameter, the
   early time data graph may be distorted by the influence of real well
   pipe storage capacity and, consequently, may yield a poor estimate of
   the parameters of the aquifer.  The method of Papadopulos and Cooper is
   already available to take pumping well pipe storage into account in
   interpreting the pumping well drawdown data, but may result in
   unreliable S values due to the difficulty in curve matching.  A more
   practical solution, which is also applicable to observation wells, is
   proposed and demonstrated with a worked example.  This solution can be
   used when the Cooper-Jacob approximation is valid and it does not
   require curve matching.  Early drawdown data in the pumping well cannot
   provide a reliable estimate of storativity for many reasons.  These
   early data can be used, however, to obtain a better estimate of
   storativity and transmissivity from the drawdown data of observation
   wells.  The effect of pumping well pipe storage in the early drawdown
   data may be significant in cases of low transmissivity aquifers and low
   pumping rates, which are quite common in ground-water remediation.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-water velocities within fractures and boreholes, hydraulic heads,
   and depth profiles of conductivity were measured along a 70 km section
   of the northeastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.  Hydraulic
   heads ranged from 40 to 60 cm above mean sea level between 2 and 4 km
   from the coast.  Fluid velocities estimated from point-dilution tests,
   in the dual-porosity rock in a borehole several kilometers from the
   coast, were 0.021 cm/sec in the fresh-water lens and 0.082 cm/sec near a
   fracture in the underlying sea-water zone.  Velocities in large
   fractures increased from 1 cm/sec 10 kilometers inland to 12 cm/sec near
   discharge points along the coast.  This increase is attributed to the
   decrease in thickness of the fresh-water lens.
   The thickness of the fresh-water lens is approximately 40\% less than
   the Ghyben-Herzberg relation predicts for a static system, providing the
   potential to drive fresh water through fractures into the sea-water zone
   below the halocline.  Overall, the halocline appears to be in a
   steady-state position due to the rapid flow of fresh water and brackish
   water towards the coast combined with rising sea water in convectional
   flow.}},

Abstract = {{Sealing characteristics of commonly used water well annular space grouts
   were investigated using a large-scale laboratory model.  The
   investigation was carried out in two phases.  In the first phase, a
   bentonite drilling mud, often used as a well sealant, was investigated
   both in the laboratory well model and in the field.  For this purpose,
   Quik-Gel(R) mud with different amounts of formation material (in this
   case sand) entrained in it was used as a sealant.  In the second phase,
   an evaluation of four grouts:  neat cement, bentonite-cement, powder
   bentonite (Volclay(R)), and granular bentonite (Benseal(R) and bentonite
   slurry mixed according to the ``Ohio{''} recipe) was undertaken with
   respect to their effectiveness in sealing the annular space.  A well
   model consisting of a sand-filled plexiglass container was constructed
   in this investigation.  Four metal well casings were installed in
   boreholes formed in the sand.  The annular space between the well
   casings and the boreholes formed in the sand were filled with various
   grouts.  The effectiveness of these materials in sealing the annular
   space was evaluated by observation of their structural stability,
   infiltration of water placed on top of the sealants, and inspection of
   the sealants dissected during disassembling of the models.  A
   finite-element computer program modeling the seepage in these well
   experiments was used to assist in the interpretation of the experimental
   results.  The results indicate that the final success of a sealant
   depends on its structural stability as much as its permeability. 
   Benseal(R)-bentonite slurry grout behaved best; neat cement and
   bentonite-cement grouts also provided good seals.  Volclay(R) and
   various Quik-Gel(R) slurries formed poorer seals compared to these. 
   Among the Quik-Gel(R) slurries, best results were obtained in the
   laboratory when a Marsh Funnel Viscosity of about 70 sec/qt was achieved
   and a mud weight of about 10 to 11 lb/gal resulted from mixing of
   formation soils.  However, field observations of drilling mud slurries
   with entrained cuttings exhibited problems of excessive settling even
   when the slurries had heavy mud weight, greater than 11 lb/gal.  The
   extent of settling appears to be positively correlated with the relative
   permeability of the native formation.  This limits the types of well
   construction where these slurries may be used as annular space seal.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the response of potentiometric levels and hydraulic
   properties to subsidence caused by a 725-ft-deep active longwall mine in
   southern Illinois.  The overburden is mainly shale but includes a
   shallow sandstone aquifer, overlain by a shale aquitard, capped by thin
   drift.  Pumping and packer tests indicate that subsidence fracturing
   increased the hydraulic conductivities of the sandstone aquifer by about
   an order of magnitude, and of certain horizons of the lower bedrock by
   several orders.  The water table in the drift aquifer was unaffected by
   mining; however, heads in the bedrock units dropped sharply in response
   to subsidence, probably because tensional dilation of fractures
   increased storativities.  The sandstone aquifer also displayed gradual
   potentiometric declines ahead of mining, and a rapid partial recovery
   afterwards.  Depression of water levels and potentially higher well
   yields represent conflicting negative and positive aspects of the
   hydrologic impact of longwall mining.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Control of ground water plays an important part in operations at many
   open pit mines.  Selection of an efficient and cost-effective
   ground-water control program is frequently complicated by the complex
   and somewhat uncertain hydrogeologic environment found at most mine
   sites.  This paper documents a case study of dewatering operations at
   Highland Valley Copper that shows how risk-cost-benefit analysis can be
   used to identify the best ground-water control strategy to improve
   stability of pit walls under such conditions.
   For each of a specified set of design alternatives, the analysis
   involves evaluation of an economic objective function, comprised of
   revenues, operating costs, and monetary risks associated with slope
   failure.  The risk calculation requires an accurate estimate of the
   probability of slope failure on the pit wall.  The calculation involves
   a coupled, steady-state, saturated-unsaturated, finite-element
   ground-water flow model and a limit equilibrium slope stability model. 
   The coupled model is invoked in a conditional Monte Carlo simulation
   that is based on a geostatistical description of the level of
   uncertainty inherent in the available hydrogeological and geotechnical
   data.
   Although the emphasis in this paper is on identifying the optimum slope
   angle and ground-water control strategy for open pit mines, the
   framework is equally well-suited to the analysis of design issues for
   any engineering projects in which the hydrogeological environment plays
   an important role.}},

Abstract = {{A typical watershed near Oak Ridge, Tennessee is underlaid by a
   stormflow zone, which approximately corresponds with the root zone of
   vegetation, and by a ground-water zone.  Analysis of the streamflow
   hydrograph and water-level hydrographs during the nongrowing season
   shows that discharge from the stormflow zone constitutes nearly all
   streamflow after the end of overland runoff but that discharge from the
   ground-water zone is dominant after about 8-10 d (days) of recession. 
   Simple equations that express the relationship between streamflow
   recession and storage depletion can be used to calculate average values
   of specific yield, transmissivity, and hydraulic conductivity in both
   the stormflow and ground-water zones.  The calculated values are
   reasonable and are nearly the same as those obtained by other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Transmissivity is often estimated from specific capacity data because of
   the expense of conducting standard aquifer tests to obtain
   transmissivity and the relative availability of specific capacity data. 
   Most often, analytic expressions relating specific capacity to
   transmissivity derived by Thomasson and others (1960), Theis (1963), or
   Brown (1963) are used in this analysis.  Razack and Huntley (1991)
   demonstrate that turbulent well loss produces poor correlation between
   measured transmissivities and those estimated from specific capacity
   from the above relations.  This study focuses on a comparison between
   transmissivity and specific capacity of wells completed as open
   boreholes in fractured-rock aquifers, where turbulent well loss may be
   less important.
   The analytic solutions typically used to predict transmissivity from
   specific capacity in alluvial aquifers do not agree well with the
   measured transmissivities in fractured-rock aquifers.  Measured
   transmissivities are less than those estimated from the theoretical
   solutions based on specific capacity.  Some of the variation may be due
   to shorter testing periods for this data set, the difference between
   storage coefficients in fractured-rock and alluvial aquifers, or aquifer
   anisotropy.  Correction for these factors alone, however, does not
   markedly improve the correlation between theoretical and observed
   specific capacity/transmissivity relations.  Transmissivities derived
   using the vertical fracture model of Gringarten and Witherspoon (1972),
   however, correlate very well with the observed specific capacities. 
   Empirical relations between the log of transmissivity and the log of
   specific capacity for the fractured-rock data set suggest they are
   linearly related (correlation coefficient of 0.89), but the width of
   90\% prediction interval is about 1.1 log cycles, indicating that the
   range of probable transmissivities corresponding to a single specific
   capacity was more than one order of magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid waste has been injected into a permeable part of the lower
   limestone of the Floridan aquifer since 1963, raising hydraulic head in
   the injection zone throughout a region of northwestern Florida.  The
   injection zone consists of a moderately permeable limestone,
   hydraulically isolated from overlying aquifers by a thick layer of clay.
   The formation fluid is saline, but becomes fresher up dip, northward
   where the limestone crops out.  Numerical simulations were performed at
   regional and local scales to assess the regional pressure increase, to
   analyze the movement of the 10,000 mg/l total dissolved solids (TDS)
   isopleth (formation fluid) in the lower limestone of the Floridan
   aquifer, and to analyze the migration  of the injection fluid, both
   historically and predictively, in the injection formation.  This work is
   based largely on previous work by Merritt (1984), but uses the SWIFT
   code.  Modifications to Merritt's work include increasing the hydraulic
   conductivity near the injection wells and using more recent injection
   rates; extensions include particle tracking and solute transport
   modeling.  The simulations indicate that regional pressure increases
   should be much less than previously predicted.  Using the new results,
   by the year 2033, the average movement of the 10,000 mg/l TDS isopleth
   due to injection is expected to be approximately 2200 ft (671 m). 
   Additionally, by the year 2033, the indiluted injection fluid (95\% of
   injection concentration) should migrate to an approximate diameter of
   2.1 mi (3.4 km) from the injection wells.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment and pore-water samples from Tertiary and Cretaceous strata in
   the New Jersey Coastal Plain were collected from cores from Freehold
   Township, Monmouth County; Howell Township, Monmouth County; and from
   Clayton Township, Gloucester County.  These strata form a multilayered
   aquifer system in which upper units are marine origin and lower units
   are predominantly nonmarine.
   Concentrations of major constituents in pore-water samples from
   confining units and aquifers were highly variable:  calcium (1.7-660
   mg/l), magnesium (0.3-140 mg/l), sulfate (1.5-2200 mg/l), and dissolved
   inorganic carbon (9-290 mg/l); with large differences between marine
   confining units and aquifers.  Where the aquifers are unconfined and
   oxic, well waters in the Potomac-Raritan-Magothy aquifer system in the
   northern Coastal Plain have higher concentrations of nitrate, chloride,
   and dissolved oxygen.  In areas where the aquifer system is confined and
   anoxic, there are higher concentrations of sulfate and bicarbonate. 
   Differences in bicarbonate concentrations between two wells (12 and 67
   mg/l) along a regional flow path can be caused by mixing of water in a
   nonmarine aquifer with leached sulfate-enriched, marine confining-unit
   water, and subsequent reduction of sulfate.
   Bacterially mediated organic carbon oxidation, iron reduction, and
   sulfate reduction, and ion-exchange reactions may explain constituent
   variations.  Bacteriological assays of core sections from the Howell and
   Clayton Township coreholes showed viable sulfate-reducing bacteria as
   deep as 558 feet below land surface.  Sediments from a depth of 210 feet
   showed populations of sulfate-reducing bacteria of 10(3)-10(6) organisms
   per gram of soil.}},

Abstract = {{The cone penetrometer with pore pressure measurements was first
   introduced in 1975.  It is generally regarded in the geotechnical
   community as one of the most efficient tools for stratigraphic logging
   of soft soils.  Recently, the conventional cone penetrometer has been
   coupled with a porous probe ground-water sampler for environmental
   applications.
   This coupled system was used to perform soil logging, collect
   ground-water samples, and evaluate hydraulic conductivity in an effort
   to determine the extent and preferential flow pathway(s) of a soluble
   hydrocarbon plume in a Texas aquifer.  Ground-water samples collected by
   a porous probe sampler were analyzed for hydrocarbon content by a
   portable gas chromatograph with a photoionization detector (GC/PID) to
   characterize the extent of the soluble organic plume and provide a field
   evaluation of ground-water quality.  Aqueous concentrations of
   hydrocarbons calculated from vapor headspace measurements by this
   technique were in good agreement with direct concentration measurements
   obtained in the laboratory using standard EPA ground-water analytical
   procedures.  This field procedure makes it possible to efficiently use
   cone penetrometry equipment in less characterized areas allowing rapid
   delineation of volatile organic plumes by the headspace analysis.
   Interpretation of the cone penetrometer test data located a buried
   channel on the site aligned in an east-west depositional direction.  To
   the north and south of the channel, the soils exhibited reduced
   hydraulic conductivity due to their respective soil type or depositional
   density.  Analyses of ground-water samples collected from the area
   confirmed that soluble hydrocarbon migration was following the more
   permeable channel.  In addition, depth selective ground-water sampling
   recorded sharp changes in the vertical concentration profiles indicating
   that macroscopic vertical dispersion may be negligible at this site.}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to determine aquifer parameter values from aquifer-test
   data has been developed that uses the pattern-matching capability of a
   neural network.  The network is trained to recognize patterns of
   normalized drawdown data as input and the corresponding aquifer
   parameters as output.  The Theis and Hantush-Jacob solutions for
   confined and leaky-confined aquifer conditions are used to derive the
   input patterns based on the parameter values selected from predetermined
   ranges.  The trained network produces output of aquifer parameter values
   when it receives the aquifer-test data as the input patterns.  The
   results obtained from this new approach are in good agreement with
   published results using other techniques.  The advantages of the present
   approach are the automated process of obtaining aquifer parameter values
   and the ability of the network to associate drawdown to the
   corresponding Theis and Hantush-Jacob solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Stone forest aquifers comprise an important class of shallow, unconfined
   karstic aquifers in the south China karst belt.  They occur under flat
   areas such as floors of karst depressions, stream valleys, and karst
   plains.  The frameworks for the aquifers are the undissolved carbonate
   spires and ribs in epikarst zones developed on carbonate strata.  The
   ground water occurs within clastic sediments which infill the
   dissolution voids.
   The aquifers are thin, generally less than 100 meters thick, and are
   characterized by large lateral permeabilities and small storage.  The
   result is that the aquifers are difficult to manage because recharge
   during the rainy season moves rapidly out of the aquifers.  Water levels
   fall sharply as the dry season progresses and the ground-water supply
   falls off accordingly.
   The magnitude and duration of the seasonal recharge pulse that
   replenishes the stone forest aquifers have been severely impacted by
   massive post-1958 deforestation in the south China karst region.  Water
   that was formerly retained beyond the wet season in the forested
   uplands, later to be released to the stone forest aquifers under the
   lowland plains, now passes quickly through the system during the wet
   season.  The loss of this seasonal upland storage has resulted in both a
   reduction in the volume of recharge to the lowland stone forest aquifers
   and a shortening of the seasonal recharge event.  The result is
   accelerated water-level declines in the stone forest aquifers as the dry
   season progresses which, in turn, causes premature dewatering of wells
   and decreased spring discharges.  This response is compounded by
   increased ground-water withdrawals as the people attempt to offset the
   declining supply.  Management of the total water-supply system requires
   not only tinkering with the aquifer, but massive reforestation efforts
   to restore dry season water retention in the upland parts of the
   watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Three functional forms relating capillary pressure to soil saturation
   (the Brooks and Corey equation, the Boltzmann distribution, and the
   Fermi distribution) were evaluated and compared by matching each form to
   soil moisture characteristic data for 12 different soil types.
   Out of 113 data sets, the Boltzmann distribution and the Brooks and
   Corey equation performed very well-and almost equally well-in matching
   the soil moisture data.  Only 10 data sets were significantly better
   matched by the Boltzmann distribution, and only nine data sets were
   significantly better matched by the Brooks and Corey equation.  The
   Fermi distribution did not achieve as high a rate of success, although
   unlike the other two functional forms, it was able to match data in all
   regions of the curve, including the capillary fringe.
   Considering that the Brooks and Corey equation and the Boltzmann
   distribution performed almost equally well, the Boltzmann distribution
   has an additional advantage:  it is amenable to an analytic solution to
   the governing differential equation for flow in unsaturated media. 
   Based on the results of this study, the authors recommend use of the
   Boltzmann distribution.}},

Abstract = {{An approach that couples flow rate measurement with mass balance
   calculations has been used to evaluate the geochemical evolution and
   kinetic behavior of Laurel Creek, West Virginia as it flows from a

   spring at the lower end of the system.  At a discharge of 1.0 m3 s-1,
   the stream was calculated to be removing calcite from the aquifer by
   dissolution at a rate of 4.1 mg 1-1 hr-1, for a total removal of 46 kg
   CaCO3/hr.  Laurel Creek remained undersaturated with respect to calcite
   throughout the entire reach studied.  Comparison of calculated
   saturation states with laboratory based kinetic mechanism information
   provided by the work of Plummer et al. (1978) suggests that the
   elementary reaction that describes attack by carbonic acid dominates
   calcite dissolution within the main conduit portion of the flow system.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{192-198}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Salt-water upconing that occurs in an aquifer overlain by a leaky
   confining bed is described in terms of an analytical model that assumes
   the existence of a sharp interface between the fresh water and salt
   water and the occurrence of a critical rise in the interface, above
   which only an unstable cone can exist.  Drawdown is calculated along the
   salt-water/fresh-water interface due to pumping from a well that
   partially penetrates the fresh-water zone, and then the Ghyben-Herzberg
   relation is used to calculate the steady-state rise in the interface,
   which is assumed to be small compared to the thickness of the aquifer. 
   The interface rise and the critical pumping rate (Q(c)) are determined
   in terms of aquifer and confining bed properties and the degree of
   penetration of the pumping well into the fresh-water zone.  The critical
   rise is assumed to occur when the interface rise is equal to 0.3 times
   the distance from the original interface location to the bottom of the
   well.  Based on the analytical model, the nondimensional critical
   pumping rate increases as the ratio of vertical to horizontal hydraulic
   conductivity (K(z)/K(r)) is decreased, and it decreases as the degree of
   well penetration (l/b) is increased.  As an example application, Q(c)
   was calculated using site-specific data from a test well in Pasco
   County, Florida.  A value of Q(c) = 4.28 x 10(5) cubic feet per day was
   determined by assuming that K(z)/K(r) = 1.0.  If K(z)/K(r) were
   subsequently determined to be less than or greater than 1.0, then the
   estimated value of Q(c) would be increased or decreased, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical, semianalytical, and numerical flow models of a
   leaky-confined fractured-carbonate aquifer were used with
   particle-tracking/stream-function programs to delineate
   traveltime-related capture zones of a municipal wellfield and to assess
   ``model{''} errors imposed by requisite assumptions associated with each
   flow model.  The analytical flow model uses the Hantush-Jacob equation
   describing two-dimensional transient drawdown surrounding a well in a
   leaky-confined aquifer with superposition of a nonuniform regional flow
   field.  The semianalytical flow model employs the Thiem equation
   describing two-dimensional steady-state drawdown surrounding a well in a
   fully confined aquifer with superposition of a uniform regional flow
   field.  The numerical flow model uses a finite-difference solution
   describing three-dimensional steady-state flow and incorporates five
   model layers, specified-flux boundary conditions, spatially variable
   recharge, and recharge from a lake.  Goodness-of-fit statistics show
   that the semianalytical flow model does not calibrate as well to
   measured heads as do the analytical and numerical flow models.  Model
   errors caused by the inability of the semianalytical flow model to
   account for vertical leakage and by the required use of a uniform
   regional flow field cause the size of the five-year capture zone to be
   overestimated and its shape to be too simplistic compared to those of
   the analytical and numerical flow models.  Polar plots of
   reverse-tracked pathline endpoints suggest that model error also
   produces significant differences in pathline trajectories.  The results
   show that in this type of hydrogeologic setting, it is necessary to use
   a flow model that accounts for vertical leakage and for the nonuniform
   character of the regional flow field.}},

Abstract = {{Inverse analytical techniques have been applied to six coincident plumes
   at Otis Air Force Base near Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  The plumes contain
   chloride, boron, trichloroethene, tetrachloroethene, and biodegradable
   and nonbiodegradable detergents.  Thus, a host of processes including
   physical, chemical, and biological, are presumed to be operative.  The
   analytical technique is structured to solve several equations
   simultaneously and provides unique values for several unknowns which
   control the behavior of the contaminant plumes.  The determined
   parameters include source strength and size, the advective position of
   the contaminant front for both retarded and unretarded constituents,
   dispersivities in x and y, and a reaction rate constant that describes
   decay, biodegradation, or chemical transformation.  The obtained values
   for the transport parameters for the different constituents were
   reasonably similar, with the transverse dispersivity ranging from 1.2 to
   2.7 m and the longitudinal dispersivity ranging from 6.1 to 7 m.  The
   unretarded advective velocity of boron, chloride, and tetrachloroethene
   were quite similar (73, 78, and 65 m/yr) whereas tetrachloroethene had a
   velocity of 48 m/yr.  Of special interest is the half-life determination
   of the reactive constituents.  The organic compounds trichloroethene and
   tetrachloroethene have half-lives of 11 and 10 years, respectively,
   whereas the biodegradable detergent with linear alkyl sulfonate had a
   half-life of 7.6 years.  In all cases, this set of parameters captures
   the essence of the various plumes with a high degree of accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past four years, we have been developing an in situ
   surfactant-washing method to decontaminate soil systems.  This study
   addresses another major step in that development:  a field test of the
   surfactant-washing method at a site contaminated with polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs) and oils.  A test plot, 10-ft diameter by 5-ft deep,
   was selected in an area of high levels of contamination.  The study
   involved applying a surfactant solution on the plot to wash the site
   material and carry the leachate down to the depressed water table, where
   it was collected by pumping a recovery well installed through the center
   of the plot.  The leachate pumped to the surface was biotreated to
   degrade the oils and surfactant, and the PCBs were removed from the
   leachate by an activated carbon system.  Soil cores from the test plot
   indicated concentrations of up to 6,223 mg/kg PCBs and 67,000 mg/kg
   oils.  The test plot initially contained about 15 kg of PCBs and 157 kg
   of oils.  The hydraulic response of the test plot to washing was
   monitored by measuring the water levels in wells around the test plot
   and the fluid pressure and saturation through the plot.  These real-time
   data were used to adjust the surfactant-application rate to minimize
   lateral spread of the surfactant and leachate and the pumping rate to
   capture all the leachate by the recovery well.  The response of
   contaminant concentrations in the test plot to washing and the
   performance of the leachate-treatment system were also monitored during
   the test by collecting and analyzing samples from the recovery well and
   from the treatment system.  An on-site laboratory was used for these
   analyses.  During the 70 days of the washing test, 5,375 gallons of a
   0.75\% aqueous surfactant solution was applied on the test plot at an
   average rate of 77 gal/day.  During the same period, 10,981 gallons of
   leachate were recovered at an average rate of 157 gal/day.  A total of
   1.6 kg of PCBs and 16.9 kg of oils (about 10\% of the initial mass) was
   washed from the test plot during the test.  Maximum concentrations of 65
   mg/l PCBs and 709 mg/l oils were measured in leachate samples.  The
   leachate was adequately treated before it was discharged.  These test
   results indicate that in situ surfactant washing is a promising
   candidate for the remediation of contaminated soil systems.}},

Abstract = {{Wastes from a wood preserving plant in Pensacola, Florida have
   contaminated the near-surface sand-and-gravel aquifer with
   creosote-derived compounds and pentachlorophenol.  Contamination
   resulted from the discharge of plant waste waters to and subsequent
   seepage from unlined surface impoundments that were in direct hydraulic
   contact with the ground water.  Two distinct phases resulted when the
   creosote and water mixed:  a denser than water hydrocarbon phase that
   moved vertically downward, and an organic-rich aqueous phase that moved
   laterally with the ground-water flow.  The aqueous phase is enriched in
   organic acids, phenolic compounds, single- and double-ring nitrogen,
   sulfur, and oxygen containing compounds, and single- and double-ring
   aromatic hydrocarbons.  The ground water is devoid of dissolved O2, is
   60-70\% saturated with CH4 and contains H2S.  Field analyses document a
   greater decrease in concentration of organic fatty acids, benzoic acid,
   phenol, 2-, 3-, 4-methylphenol, quinoline, isoquinoline,
   1(2H)-quinolinone, and 2(1H)-isoquinolinone during downgradient movement
   in the aquifer than could be explained by dilution and/or dispersion. 
   Laboratory microcosm studies have shown that within the study region,
   this effect can be attributed to microbial degradation to CH4 and CO2. 
   A small but active methanogenic population was found on sediment
   materials taken from highly contaminated parts of the aquifer.}},

   relatively inexpensive isotopic data can be used to help solve a complex
   hydrogeologic problem.
   Acidic (pH 3 to 4) and neutral (pH 6.0 to 7.7) mine drain waters have
   been identified and sampled in the mining districts in the central
   Wasatch Range of Utah.  The chemical evolution of acid and neutral mine
   waters follow fundamentally different chemical and isotopic evolutionary
   pathways which reflect fundamentally different flow histories.  Most
   neutral mine discharges are either low iron calcium-bicarbonate waters
   or iron and sulfate rich waters.  Stable isotopic values of delta-H-2
   and delta-O-18 plot near and parallel to the meteoric water line (MWL),
   suggesting a meteoric origin for all mine waters.  H-3 concentrations
   (20.9 to 40.8 TU) and C-14 activities (46.2 to 96.3 pmc) indicate mine
   waters have a major component of modern recharge water.  Shallow
   circulation of most mine discharges is suggested by low TDS, nonthermal
   discharge temperatures and the proximity of most mine workings to the
   surface.
   The delta-S-34 values of mine discharge waters tend to cluster about two
   nodes.  Neutral mine drainages with low SO42- contents cluster about
   delta-S-34 = 0 parts per thousand, whereas neutral mine drainages with
   high SO42- contents cluster about delta-S-34 = + 5.5 parts per thousand.
   An acid mine drainage also has a delta-S-34 value of about 0 parts per
   thousand. delta-S-34 values of almost-equal-to 0 parts per thousand are
   attributed to the oxidation of pyrite and other sulfide minerals,
   whereas more positive isotopic values are attributed to isotopic
   fractionation accompanying the dissolution of gypsum and anhydrite. 
   Only mine discharges with a delta-S-34 almost-equal-to 0 parts per
   thousand have the potential to produce acid drainage.  Geologic and
   delta-C-13 data suggest acid mine waters (mean delta-C-13 = -15.0 parts
   per thousand) discharge from ground-water flow systems generally devoid
   of carbonate rocks.  Neutral mine waters (mean delta-C-13 = -9.7 parts
   per thousand) discharge from aquifers containing abundant carbonate
   rocks which neutralize excess H+ ions released by the oxidization of
   sulfide minerals.}},

Abstract = {{When found dissolved in ground water, chlorinated hydrocarbon (CHC)
   solvents such as tetrachloroethylene (PCE) are nearly always encountered
   at concentrations far below their solubilities.  This is true even in
   cases when it is known or at least strongly suspected that actual liquid
   solvent is present in the aquifer.  In contrast, laboratory studies
   using columns packed with porous media containing various organic fluids
   have indicated that when water is forced to flow through a zone
   containing an immobile organic fluid, saturation concentrations can be
   achieved rapidly.  This study investigated the concentrations and mass
   removal rates obtainable when simulated ground water is free to flow at
   least partially around a zone of porous medium that contains solvent in
   a state of stable, residual saturation.  Reductions in the mass removal
   rate due to reduced permeability in the solvent zone were found to be
   minimal under the conditions of the experiment.  Thus, near the source
   the plume was essentially the same width as the source zone, and PCE
   concentrations in the center of the plume were at or near saturation,
   even at water velocities of 100 cm/day.  The fact that CHC aqueous
   concentrations in ground-water samples are typically far below
   saturation is, therefore, likely not due to limited dissolution from the
   fingers of residual solvent.  Probable explanations include the
   preferential formation of thin pools rather than fingers of CHC,
   dispersion during transport, and dilution by uncontaminated water in
   monitoring or pumping wells.}},

Abstract = {{During unsteady or transient ground-water flow, the fluid mass per unit
   volume of aquifer changes as the potentiometric head changes, and solute
   transport is affected by this change in fluid storage.  Three widely
   applied numerical models of two-dimensional transport partially account
   for the effects of transient flow by removing terms corresponding to the
   fluid continuity equation from the transport equation, resulting in a
   simpler governing equation.  However, fluid-storage terms remaining in
   the transport equation that change during transient flow are, in certain
   cases, held constant in time in these models.  For the case of
   increasing heads, this approximation, which is unacknowledged in these
   models' documentation, leads to transport velocities that are too high,
   and increased concentration at fluid and solute sources.  If heads are
   dropping in time, computed transport velocities are too low.  Using
   parameters that somewhat exaggerate the effects of this approximation,
   an example numerical simulation indicates solute travel time error of
   about 14 percent but only minor errors due to incorrect dilution volume.
   For horizontal flow and transport models that assume fluid density is
   constant, the product of porosity and aquifer thickness changes in time:
   initial porosity times initial thickness plus the change in head times
   the storage coefficient.  This formula reduces to the saturated
   thickness in unconfined aquifers if porosity is assumed to be constant
   and equal to specific yield.  The computational cost of this more
   accurate representation is insignificant and is easily incorporated in
   numerical models of solute transport.}},

Abstract = {{Any air entrapped in the completion region of a piezometer endows that
   piezometer with storage due to the compressibility of the air.  Such
   storage retards the recovery of water levels in the piezometer and leads
   to underestimation of formation hydraulic conductivity in the
   interpretation of slug tests.  These effects appear to be greatest for
   piezometers with small-diameter casings installed in low-permeability
   formations where filter pack materials are placed dry around the
   piezometer intake.  This paper presents (a) a method which accounts for
   storage due to entrapped air in slug test analysis; (b) examples
   illustrating the method; and (c) some recommendations for piezometer
   construction and slug test practice.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 10 years, several fluorinated derivatives of benzoic acid
   have proven their usefulness as nonreactive water tracers.  In this
   study, the suitability of four previously untested isomers of
   difluorobenzoate (DFBA) as saturated- and unsaturated-zone tracers was
   examined in a series of laboratory and field experiments.  Experimental
   conditions included batch shaking tests with two different soils,
   laboratory soil column tests under saturated and unsaturated conditions,
   a three-month aquifer tracer test, and a month-long tracer test in a
   field soil.  Bromide, which is considered nonreactive in most
   hydrological environments, was included as an index tracer in each
   experiment.  Under every condition, each DFBA isomer showed the same
   concentration distribution and mass recovery as Br-.  These and other
   previously tested fluorobenzoates were ranked according to their
   suitability as nonreactive soil and ground-water tracers.}},

Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The islands of Bermuda and Great Exuma are similar in that they are both
   composed of Quaternary marginal-marine, calcarenitic limestones.  These
   limestones are predominantly eolianite.  Topographic depressions between
   eolian ridges are locally lower than present sea level; consequently,
   the ground water is coupled to inland marshes and ponds.  The islands
   differ climatically.  Rainfall in Bermuda exceeds potential
   evapotranspiration by about 0.1 m/yr, while in Great Exuma, potential
   evapotranspiration exceeds rainfall by some 0.5 m/yr.  As a result, the
   inland ponds of Great Exuma are brackish to hypersaline, and fresh-water
   lenses are localized beneath the topographic highs between the ponds and
   the shoreline.  In contrast, the marshes of Bermuda are not strong
   discharge sites, and the surrounding fresh-water lenses are geologically
   rather than topographically controlled.  Dupuit-Ghyben-Herzberg modeling
   indicates that if the climates of Bermuda and Great Exuma were reversed,
   the characteristics of their fresh-water lenses would be reversed as
   well.  This comparison indicates that climate, as reflected in the water
   budget, is one of the important controlling variables in the occurrence
   and geometry of fresh-water lenses in low-lying subtropical islands.}},

Abstract = {{Aquifer-test analysis, evaluation of potentiometric data, and numerical
   simulation of ground-water flow are useful techniques for detecting
   hydraulic barriers in Pleistocene buried-valley aquifers.  Using these
   techniques, hydraulic barriers were identified in both the Spiritwood
   and Sundre-New Rockford buried-valley aquifers in North Dakota.  The
   existence of hydraulic barriers in these two aquifers was confirmed by
   geologic data obtained from test drilling.
   Two types of hydraulic barriers have been distinguished based on
   orientation with respect to the principal axes of buried valleys. 
   Longitudinal hydraulic barriers are relatively narrow, linearly
   discontinuous ridges comprised of shale bedrock or till that are aligned
   roughly parallel to the long axes of buried valleys.  Transverse
   hydraulic barriers are narrow, continuous barriers comprised of silt and
   clay aligned roughly perpendicular to the long axes of buried valleys.
   The principal directions of ground-water flow in buried-valley aquifers
   commonly are parallel to longitudinal hydraulic barriers and
   perpendicular to transverse hydraulic barriers.  As a result, under
   natural conditions, transverse hydraulic barriers generally are
   manifested by larger potentiometric surface discontinuities.
   Pleistocene drainageways explain the occurrence and formation of
   hydraulic barriers in buried-valley aquifers.  Longitudinal hydraulic
   barriers are erosional features that appear to be formed by
   stream-valley bifurcation in melt-water channels of glacial-lake
   spillways.  Transverse hydraulic barriers appear to be formed by
   catastrophic flooding along spillways from the rapid drainage of glacial
   lakes and subsequent deposition of silt and clay deposits by sluggish,
   underfit streams.}},

Abstract = {{The Middendorf aquifer of South Carolina exhibits a 40-kilometer-wide
   zone where dissolved ferrous iron concentrations commonly exceed 1 mg/l.
   Downgradient of this zone, dissolved iron concentrations decrease to
   less than 0.05 mg/l. Geochemical and microbiologic evidence indicates
   that this zonation reflects the competitive exclusion of
   sulfate-reducing activity by Fe(III)-reducing bacteria in the high-iron
   zone and the emergence of sulfate reduction as the predominant process
   in the low-iron zone. Viable Fe(III)- and sulfate-reducing bacteria
   coexist throughout the aquifer. However, the observed linear
   relationship between dissolved iron and dissolved inorganic carbon as
   well as the lack of sulfate consumption indicates that sulfate-reducing
   bacteria are much less active than Fe(III)-reducing bacteria in the
   high-iron zone. Fe(III)-reducing bacteria appear to exclude
   sulfate-reducing activity by maintaining dissolved hydrogen
   (approximately 1.0 nM), formate (approximately 2.0-mu-M), and acetate
   (approximately 1.0-mu-M) concentrations at levels lower than thresholds
   required by sulfate-reducing bacteria. Downgradient of the high-iron
   zone, Fe(III)-reducing activity becomes limited by a lack of Fe(III)
   oxyhydroxides as Middendorf sediments become progressively more marine
   in origin. Hydrogen, formate, and acetate concentrations then increase
   to levels (approximately 3.0 nM, approximately 10.9, and 2.5-mu-M,
   respectively), that allow sulfate-reducing bacteria to become active.
   Increased sulfide production strips ferrous iron from solution by
   precipitating ferrous sulfides, and dissolved iron concentrations
   decrease. The observed high-iron zonation is thus one manifestation of
   microbial competition for scarce substrates. The wide occurrence of
   similar water-chemistry patterns implies that microbial competition
   mechanisms are important to the ground-water geochemistry of many
   hydrologic systems.}},

Abstract = {{A nonsteady-state model is presented and used in simulating the results
   of field experiments where chlorinated ethenes were cometabolically
   degraded by methanotrophic bacteria.  In cometabolism, contaminants are
   degraded fortuitously by microbes growing on a primary substrate, which
   in this case is methane.  The model includes microbial processes of
   microbial growth, utilization of the electron donor (methane) and the
   electron acceptor (oxygen), and the cometabolic transformation of the
   chlorinated ethenes coupled with the transport processes of advection,
   dispersion, and sorption onto the aquifer solids.
   Model simulations of the chlorinated ethenes biotransformation resulting
   from the biostimulation of methanotrophic bacteria agreed well with the
   field observations.  A kinetic model for the cometabolic transformation
   that included the competitive inhibition by methane was required to
   match the field observations.  The simulations duplicated the cyclic
   oscillations in concentration of the chlorinated ethenes that resulted
   from the pulse feeding of methane.  Rate-limited sorption and desorption
   were also required in order to match the extended tailing in the
   concentration response that was observed along with the pulsed
   oscillations in the concentration due to competitive inhibition.
   The kinetic parameters for the cometabolic transformation, derived from
   model fits to the field observations, differed for the different
   chlorinated ethenes tested.  Vinyl chloride (VC) and
   trans-dichloroethylene (t-DCE) had the highest biotransformation rate
   coefficients (k/K(s)), which were in the range of methane itself, the
   primary substrate for methanotrophic growth.  Cis-dichloroethylene
   (c-DCE) and trichloroethylene (TCE) were degraded at rates one and two
   orders of magnitude lower than methane, respectively.  The
   transformation rate for TCE was consistent with laboratory-derived rates
   from microbes enriched and isolated from the test zone and grown under
   conditions that most represented those in the field.  The kinetic model
   also permitted the activation and the deactivation of microbial mass
   towards the cometabolic transformation, which was based on cell growth
   and decay, and first-order deactivation.}},

Abstract = {{Failure to incorporate retardation factors in solute transport
   predictions can lead to serious miscalculations of the degree of
   contamination and the time required for remediation.  This study employs
   history matching, a vital component in the effort to calibrate models to
   specific field sites, to demonstrate the difficulties in matching
   historical well concentrations to a single retardation factor or source
   function.  A 2-D hybrid finite-element/finite-difference,
   advection-dispersion code with retardation was used to match simulated
   perchloroethylene (PCE, also known as tetrachloroethylene)
   concentrations against observed concentrations in monitor wells at a
   well-characterized Superfund site.  The transport model yielded
   reasonable matches for retardation factors between 1 and 3.  This was in
   comparison to the 6 to 22 range of retardation factors based on
   laboratory batch sorption experiments and the 1 to 5 range based on
   field measurements of soil and associated well-water pore fluid. 
   Simulation results demonstrated that for this site, retardation factors
   greater than or equal to 6 would imply releases of PCE prior to dates
   compatible with historical records.  History matching can constrain the
   reasonable range of parameters necessary to model contaminants in ground
   water.}},

Abstract = {{Ground-water flow in naturally fractured rocks of low permeability
   terrain presents special problems which cannot be solved by classical
   radial flow techniques.  Existence of fractures in these rocks increases
   the conductivity of the media, but the storativity does not increase
   significantly.  Especially, a dominant vertical fracture in hydraulic
   connection with a well provides an extended surface for ground water to
   enter the well.  Such a well and fracture combination is referred to as
   an ``extended well{''}.  The analytical approach to the ground-water
   flow problem of extended wells cannot be achieved through merely radial
   or linear flow alone if the vertical fracture is of finite length.  In
   fact, in practice, the fracture lengths are almost always of finite
   length, and the flow pattern is a mixture of radial and linear flows. 
   This paper presents a simplified conceptual model for the ground-water
   flow pattern around an extended well leading to an analytical solution
   with type curves which can be used in determining the aquifer parameters
   from the field measurements of time-drawdown data.  It is observed that
   for large times, extended well type curves merge with the Theis curve,
   and consequently the Jacob straight-line method becomes applicable.  In
   addition, as the vertical fracture length becomes smaller, the resulting
   type curve approaches the Theis type curve.  The methodology has been
   applied for ground-water flow in a folded and fractured limestone
   formation in the Conasauga Group of East Tennessee.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, nonlinear least-squares analysis of pump test data is
   used as a method for estimating aquifer parameters and choosing a
   conceptual model of the aquifer.  The goal of this study is to
   investigate the potential advantages and disadvantages of using
   statistical algorithms for pump test analyses.  Four different aquifer
   models were fitted to an extensive set of pump test data to characterize
   the aquifer at a single aquifer test site.  These models were the Theis
   model, the equipotential boundary model, the confined leaky aquifer
   model, and the water-table aquitard model.  For several of the data
   sets, more than one aquifer model was found to match the pump test
   response with the same residual least-squares error, and a review of the
   local hydrogeology was required to choose the leaky aquifer model as the
   most appropriate aquifer model.  A few data sets, however, did not agree
   well with the leaky aquifer model.  Using the fitting routine, the
   water-table aquitard model was found to significantly improve the fit to
   these data sets.  Further analysis of hydrogeologic features at the site
   indicated that the duration of the pump tests which matched the leaky
   aquifer model was probably insufficient to exhibit deviation from the
   leaky aquifer model.  The water-table aquitard model is, therefore,
   chosen as the most suitable model for this site, and parameters for the
   aquifer are estimated using the results from the fitting procedure.  In
   comparison, an earlier graphical interpretation of these pump tests did
   not distinguish the improved fit which could be obtained with the
   water-table aquitard model.  However, the graphical analyses were
   valuable as they did provide preliminary estimates of the aquifer
   transmissivity, aiding in accepting or rejecting the results of the
   fitting analysis.  Thus, we found that nonlinear least-squares analysis
   can complement, but does not replace, graphical interpretation methods. 
   The nonlinear least-squares analysis can provide a means for analyzing
   pump tests which may not have been easily interpreted using traditional
   techniques, as the nonlinear least-squares analysis attempts to match
   all the test data at both large and small values of time.  However, this
   analysis also illustrates that fitting methods cannot be totally
   automated, but rather must be interpreted in light of other
   hydrogeologic data in order to arrive at a reasonable model for the
   aquifer.}},

Pages = {{78-86}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{A one-dimensional numerical model is developed with oscillating
   velocities and dispersions to simulate the migration process of a
   contaminant plume within tidally influenced aquifers.  Model simulations
   demonstrate that a major effect the tidal fluctuation has on the
   migration process of a contaminant plume is the exit concentration
   discharging to the tidal estuary.  Tidal fluctuation causes the exit
   concentration levels to be significantly diluted by the surface-water
   body of the estuary.  Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that tidal
   fluctuation hastens the rate of plume migration near the bank of the
   estuary because of the relatively high advective and dispersive fluxes
   induced by tides.  However, tides affect the migration process only over
   a short distance from the tidal-water interface (about 40 ft for the
   parameters used in this study).  If the contaminant plume is located far
   beyond the interface, tidal fluctuations will not affect the rate of
   plume migration until an existing regional ground-water flow velocity
   brings the plume to the tidally active zone.  With or without tides, the
   rate of contaminant migration increases with higher regional hydraulic
   gradient.  Furthermore, the effects of tidal fluctuations on the
   transport process become insignificant with higher regional hydraulic
   gradients.}},

Abstract = {{The U.S. Geological Survey's Amargosa Tracer Calibration Site in
   southern Nevada has been used for three different recirculating tracer
   tests using as tracers:  (1) tritium, (2) sulfur-35, and (3) tritium and
   bromide together.  Although the physical setup, well spacings, and thus
   apparent scale were the same in all tests, the recirculating rates and
   pore pressures were different.  Apparent dispersivities found in the
   three tests differed considerably, revealing an inverse relationship
   between computed dispersivity and recirculation rate.  These differences
   are believed to be caused primarily by changes in fissure-aperture
   widths and thus, hydraulic conductivities, with resulting changes in
   flow rates and directions caused by changes in pore pressure between
   different tests in the presence of high ambient pore pressure.  The
   results of this study indicate that forced-gradient tracer tests for
   determination of dispersivity should not be performed when ambient pore
   pressure and/or testing pore pressure is a significant percentage of
   overburden pressure.  In addition, apparent dispersivity calculated by
   forced-gradient tracer tests can differ considerably from that of
   unstressed natural situations, and consequent solute-transport estimates
   are likely to be in error.}},

Abstract = {{Despite convincing evidence that fracture trace mapping can be extremely
   useful in locating sites for high-yield wells, well drillers persist in
   using the ``lay of the land{''} to select well sites.  This paper
   examines:  (1) the value of topographic variables in predicting the
   productivity of wells in crystalline rocks; and (2) whether topographic
   data for well sites can increase the accuracy of well yield predictions
   based on fracture trace data alone.  Topographic and fracture trace data
   for 29 wells in the Georgia Piedmont and Blue Ridge area were studied. 
   Regression analysis revealed that the LeGrand (1967) point value (TOPO)
   explained only 0.3\% of the variation in the productivity of the 29
   wells.  More explanation was afforded by the less subjective topographic
   variables, distance from the well to the nearest valley or draw axis
   (DISTV), and the difference in elevation between the nearest valley or
   draw axis and the well site (ELEV).  Together these variables still
   explained only 15.3\% of the variation in well productivity.
   Brook (1988) showed that a single fracture trace variable, distance from
   the well to the nearest fracture trace intersection (DISTIN), explained
   59\% of the variation in the productivity of the 29 wells and that the
   two variables well depth and DISTIN explained 81\% of the variation in
   well productivity.  Addition of the topographic variables TOPO, DISTV,
   and ELEV to the models of well productivity developed by Brook (1988)
   did not greatly improve the explanation.  None of the added variables
   were significant at the 0.05 confidence level.  Results, therefore,
   indicate that well productivity is only poorly related to topographic
   characteristics, perhaps explaining why so many of the wells drilled in
   crystalline rocks using the ``lay of the land{''} have a low yield or
   are dry regardless of their topographic locations.}},

Abstract = {{Batch adsorption and desorption equilibrium experiments were used to
   evaluate lithium sorption on crushed tuff in contact with ground water.
   The laboratory studies were conducted in support of saturated zone
   characterization field tests to be performed near Yucca Mountain,
   Nevada. These studies included equilibrium experiments conducted at
   38-degrees-C (expected subsurface temperature) for a 1- to 2,000-mg/l
   range of initial lithium solution concentrations. Data from the
   equilibrium experiments were used in the evaluation of Linear, Langmuir,
   Freundtich, and Modified Freundlich isotherm expressions.
   Comparisons of adsorption and desorption isotherms showed that lithium
   adsorption was reversible for solution concentrations up to 150 mg/l.
   This conclusion was based on F-test comparisons of predicted adsorption
   and desorption data from Langmuir isotherms.
   Lithium sorption was best represented by the nonlinear isotherms where
   the Langmuir gave the best fit followed by the Modified Freundlich and
   Freundlich. When these isotherms were used in a one-dimensional, column
   adsorption transport code, differences occurred in the predicted
   breakthrough curves. The transport results showed differences of as much
   as a factor of five in the time of arrival of lithium for the various
   isotherms depending on the influent concentration chosen. The
   differences in the simulation breakthrough curves indicate the
   importance of isotherm selection. Statistical discrimination and column
   experiments are suggested as better evaluations of isotherms that are to
   be incorporated into field-scale transport simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The safety assessment of underground disposal of nuclear or toxic wastes
   requires the use of models. Such models need to be validated to ensure,
   as much as possible, that they are a good representation of the actual
   processes occurring in the real system. In this paper an attempt is made
   to take a broad view by reviewing step by step the modeling process and
   bringing out the need for validating every step of this process. Thus,
   model validation includes not only comparison of modeling results with
   data from selected experiments , but also evaluation of procedures for
   the construction of conceptual models and calculational models as well
   as methodologies for studying data and parameter correlation. The need
   for advancing basic scientific knowledge in related fields, for multiple
   assessment groups, and for presenting our modeling efforts in open
   literature for public scrutiny is also emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of the liquid pressure in a casing-tubing annulus confined by
   the wellhead at the surface and by a packer above the injection interval
   is a simple and inexpensive method of detecting the loss of mechanical
   integrity in wells used for disposal of liquid wastes. However,
   variations in annular pressure which occur in response to changes in
   injection rate and injected fluid temperature complicate the
   interpretation of annular pressure data. The variation of fluid and
   formation temperatures with depth, the expansion and contraction of
   fluids and metal tubing with pressure and temperature, and wellbore
   depth and geometry, have been combined in a model of annular pressure
   response to fluid injection. The response to changes in injected fluid
   rate and temperature have been simulated with the model and verified by
   field experiment. Although the response to a change in injection rate or
   temperature is greatest in the first two hours following the change,
   annulus pressure continues to vary with time and a true steady-state was
   not attained.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{838-848}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple yet effective approach and methodology for
   the problem of evaluating ground-water remedial alternatives at a waste
   disposal site, and discusses the application of this approach in a case
   study. The attainment areas, which represent the areas (outside the
   contaminant source itself) in which remediation is required, are first
   identified. Simulation of ground-water flow in three dimensions,
   augmented by fluid particle tracking, is utilized to evaluate the travel
   times of ground water through the attainment areas. The mixed linear
   reservoir or ``batch flush{''} model is then used to estimate the number
   of pore volumes which must be flushed through each attainment area in
   order to achieve remediation. The travel times are used in conjunction
   with this pore volume figure to estimate the time required for cleanup
   under each alternative. By comparing the cleanup time, the costs, and
   other features of each alternative, a cost-effective remedy for the
   study site can be determined. While the development of remedial
   alternatives and the choice of the most cost-effective remedy are highly
   site-specific, the approach and methodology outlined in this paper have
   general applicability. The results presented herein also provide insight
   into the difficulties and special considerations associated with
   modeling and analyzing remedial alternatives.}},

   ZONES OF WELLS USING CONVEX HULLS AS CONFIDENCE-REGIONS}},

Abstract = {{Determination of traveltime-related capture zones of wells in instances
   where there is a lack of adequate or reliable site-specific values of
   hydraulic parameters and/or the heterogeneous character of the geologic
   materials may lead to designation and management of wellhead-protection
   areas of dubious function. In these instances, Monte Carlo simulation
   can be used to determine traveltime-related capture zones that account
   for the uncertainty in values of hydraulic and geologic parameters that
   cannot be accounted for by deterministically based flow models.
   Monte Carlo simulations using 100 randomly generated values of hydraulic
   conductivity and effective porosity were used to determine one-year
   capture zones based on determination of percentile confidence regions
   from reverse-tracked flowpaths emanating from a well completed in a
   leaky-confined aquifer. The mean of the lognormal distribution used to
   generate the hydraulic-conductivity values was taken to be 3.89 ft/d,
   the log of the average value from an aquifer test, and a standard
   deviation of 1.0 ft/d was used. The normal distribution used to generate
   the effective porosity values had a mean of 25 percent and a standard
   deviation of 3.5 percent. The values of hydraulic conductivity and
   effective porosity were ordered and then paired to induce correlation.
   Other relevant hydraulic and geologic parameters were fixed at average
   or observed values from the available data.
   Simulations were made using an analytical flow model in conjunction with
   a particle-tracking program to obtain 100 sets of endpoint coordinates
   for 36 reverse-tracked, one-year flowpaths emanating from the well.
   Wellhead-protection areas based on the 90th- and 75th-percentile
   confidence regions of the distribution of 3,600 endpoints were
   determined by deleting the 10 and 25 most-extreme (distant) endpoints,
   respectively, from the 100 sets of flowpath endpoints of the 36
   flowpaths. Delineation of the wellhead-protection areas was based on
   determination of the convex hull of the remaining endpoints. The
   distribution of remaining endpoints around the well also was used to
   determine optimum locations for construction of sentinel wells to detect
   contaminants moving toward the well along the most probable flowpaths.}},

Title = {{ASSESSING TRANSMISSIVITY FROM SPECIFIC CAPACITY IN A LARGE AND

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{856-861}},

Abstract = {{Transmissivity is often estimated from specific capacity data because of
   the expense of conducting standard aquifer tests to obtain
   transmissivity and the relative availability of specific capacity data.
   Most often, analytic expressions relating specific capacity to
   transmissivity derived by Thomasson and others (1960), Theis (1963), or
   Brown (1963) are used in this analysis. This paper focuses on a test of
   these relations using a large (215 pairs) data set from a heterogeneous
   aquifer.
   The analytic solutions predicting transmissivity from specific capacity
   do not agree well with the measured transmissivities, apparently due to
   turbulent well loss within the production wells, which is not taken into
   account by any of the analytic solutions. Empirical relations are better
   than the theoretical relations. Log-log functions have greater
   correlation coefficients than linear functions. The best relation found
   for the data set chosen for this study has a correlation coefficient of
   0.63, but the prediction interval was about 1.2 log cycles, indicating
   that the range of probable transmissivities corresponding to a single
   specific capacity was more than one order of magnitude. Tests with
   smaller subsets of data suggest that correlations based on data sets of
   10 points or less are of limited value.}},

   modest set of basic information was provided together with one of four
   sets of supplementary data. The embedded knowledge in the EXPAR system
   appeared to provide valuable assistance in modeling, and the system
   itself met our expectations in terms of the user-friendliness and
   robustness. Additional work will be required to remove the weaknesses
   found in the evaluation particularly with respect to biodegradation data

Abstract = {{A method is presented to evaluate the influence of redox conditions and
   pH on mineralization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in
   subsurface environments. Microbial yields based on the free energy
   liberated from heterotrophic PAH metabolism are estimated under various
   environmental conditions using a simple bioenergetic growth model. The
   types and chemical forms of electron acceptors addressed in this paper
   include oxygen, nitrate, sulfate, carbon dioxide, iron (Fe+3 and FeOOH),
   and manganese (Mn+4 and MnO2). PAHs addressed include naphthalene
   (2-fused aromatic rings), anthracene (3-fused aromatic rings),
   phenanthrene (3-fused aromatic rings), and pyrene (4-fused aromatic
   rings).
   Calculated free energy changes demonstrated that sequential utilization
   of electron acceptors will follow the order Mn+4 O2, NO3-1, Fe+3, MnO2,
   FeOOH, SO4-2, and CO2. The behavior in microbial growth yield
   predictions were found to mimic the change in free energy liberated with
   the use of different electron acceptors. Despite release of free energy
   under all conditions evaluated, the small energy liberated during PAH
   mineralization under sulfate-reducing and methanogenic conditions
   suggests that heterotrophic degradation of PAH compounds under these
   conditions is unlikely to occur.
   The large microbial growth yields associated with reduction of free
   metal species (Mn+4 , Fe+3 ) during PAH oxidation suggest a selective
   advantage for microbes that can tolerate acid conditions and/or
   participate in metal chelation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Multilevel slug tests were conducted in a confined, granular aquifer
   near Mobile, Alabama. Tracer injection and travel time experiments, more
   direct measurements of transport in the aquifer, were also conducted at
   the same location. The objective was to compare results of the two field
   investigations to ascertain the accuracy and utility of slug testing to
   measure transport properties of the aquifer. Nondimensional hydraulic
   conductivity profiles inferred from the slug tests and the tracer
   experiments were similar. The similarity of the profiles supported the
   utility of multilevel slug testing to characterize the hydraulic
   conductivity profile in the aquifer.
   The slug test data collected in three wells were interpreted using a
   radial flow model (Cooper et al., 1967) and a finite element model which
   considered both radial and vertical flow (Widdowson et al., 1989, 1990).
   Hydraulic conductivity values inferred from the measured data
   considering both radial and vertical flow were approximately two-thirds
   of the values inferred assuming radial flow.}},

Abstract = {{Results of three independent experimental methods for determination of
   sorption coefficients were compared on sieved aquifer material samples
   from Columbus AFB, Columbus, Mississippi. These aquifer materials
   contained < 0.1\% organic carbon, and sorption coefficients for
   naphthalene ranged from 0.06 to 0.20 l/kg.  There was low correlation
   between organic carbon contents and sorption coefficients. Good
   agreement was found among sorption coefficients measured by batch,
   dynamic column, and dynamic box methods. Similarity of the coefficients
   was attributed to measured fast sorption kinetics and to linearity of
   isotherms observed for naphthalene sorption on Columbus aquifer
   material. Results indicate that channeling, wall and end effects, and
   particle loss were insignificant in the dynamic systems. Since
   laboratory sorption coefficient measurements were found impractical on
   whole sand-gravel aquifer samples, an equation is proposed to convert
   laboratory measured sorption coefficients on the separated sand (< 2 mm)
   fraction to sorption coefficients on whole sand-gravel aquifer
   materials.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{914-921}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Little field-scale research has been done to evaluate the effectiveness
   of compacted soil barriers in retarding the movement of water and
   leachates. In response to this need, the Illinois State Geological
   Survey constructed and instrumented an experimental compacted soil
   liner. Infiltration of water into the liner has been monitored for two
   years. The objectives of this investigation were to determine whether a
   soil liner could be constructed to meet the U.S. EPA's requirement for a
   saturated hydraulic conductivity of less than or equal to 1.0 X 10(-7)
   cm/s, to quantify the areal variability of the hydraulic properties of
   the liner, and to determine the transit time for water and tracers
   through the liner.
   The liner measures 8 m X 15 m X 0.9 m and was designed and constructed
   to simulate compacted soil liners built at waste disposal facilities.
   The surface of the liner was flooded to form a pond on April 12,1988.
   Since flooding, infiltration has been monitored with four large-ring
   (LR) and 32 small-ring (SR) infiltrometers, and a water-balance (WB)
   method that accounted for total infiltration and evaporation.
   Ring-infiltrometer and WB data were analyzed using
   cumulative-infiltration curves to determine infiltration fluxes. The SR
   data are lognormally distributed, and the SR and LR data form two
   statistically distinct populations. Small-ring data are nearly identical
   with WB data; because there is evidence of leakage in the LRs, the SR
   and WB data are considered more reliable.
   Geostatistical analysis of the SR infiltration data revealed that the
   infiltration-flux data were unstructured (random) at scales greater than
   0.8 m. This analysis shows that it is possible to construct a compacted
   soil liner with a uniformly low saturated hydraulic conductivity, and
   that classical statistics should adequately estimate the mean
   infiltration flux of the liner and the associated uncertainty in that
   value.
   Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the liner was estimated using
   Darcy's Law and the Green-Ampt Approximation; the average values for
   these calculations, based on the first and second years of SR data, were
   4.0 X 10(-8) and 3.4 X 10(-8) cm/s, respectively. Breakthrough of water
   at the liner's bottom is expected to occur approximately six years after
   the initial ponding of the liner.}},

Abstract = {{Computer software with embedded knowledge has the potential to improve
   the utility and usability of computer models.  We explore these
   opportunities with the software package Expert ROKEY that includes
   EXPAR, a knowledge-based system to assist in the preparation of input

   levels.  At the top level is a set of computer forms that contain groups
   of related parameters and corresponding entry fields.  Users can either
   volunteer parameter values or request help from an assistance program. 
   Elaboration programs provide supporting information for each parameter
   and brief tutorials for the mass transport processes included in the
   model.  The sets of assistance and elaboration programs represent the
   bottom level of EXPAR.  This model preprocessor contains useful features
   like tutorial and data-base information, systematic procedures for
   deriving parameter values, capabilities for checking the completeness
   and consistency of data, and a virtually transparent user interface with
   the computer, which are applicable to codes of all types.}},

Abstract = {{One method for the disposal of hazardous liquid wastes is by injection
   into deep aquifers.  Although these aquifers may be separated from
   underground sources of drinking water by thick formations of low
   permeability, their mobility due to different migration mechanisms has
   to be studied carefully, since the injected wastes remain toxic over
   periods of thousands of years.  One possible mechanism for waste
   movement is density-driven flow and transport, due to density
   differences between the waste and the surrounding water in the injection
   zone.  In the present paper the importance of this phenomenon is studied
   mathematically by means of analytical and numerical calculations for
   typical deep injection conditions.  The analytical estimates reveal that
   density-driven movement of liquid wastes in sloping aquifers can be much
   stronger than plume migration due to natural hydraulic gradients.  This
   finding is emphasized by the results of a two-dimensional vertical
   finite element model, which is applied for detailed numerical
   simulations.  Results show that during the initial stage, waste can be
   expected to spread into all directions due to density-induced
   stratification effects.  Later on, it mainly moves laterally along the
   slope of either aquifer top or aquifer bottom, depending on the waste
   density.  If regional ground-water flow is directed the same way,
   transport is accelerated.  If regional ground-water flow is in the
   opposite direction, on the other hand, transport to both sides must be
   expected to occur.  Thus, the aquifer slope and regional hydraulic
   gradient may be equally significant factors in estimating potential
   migration of disposed liquid wastes.}},

Abstract = {{Waste water injected into aquifers bounded by aquitards can potentially
   leak into the aquitards and eventually reach other layers.  Based on the
   mathematical framework of an earlier model, the current study deals with
   steady-state and transient solutions for solute transport from an
   injection well into a three-layer leaky aquifer system consisting of a
   pumped and an unpumped aquifer separated by an aquitard.  Solutes are
   assumed to be transported by horizontal advection within the pumped
   aquifer, by advection and dispersion in a vertical flow field in the
   aquitard, and by molecular diffusion under hydrostatic conditions in the
   unpumped aquifers.  Proper leaky aquifer well hydraulics are used to
   describe the ground-water flow fields in the model, and radioactive
   (biological) decay and linear isotherm adsorption are considered.  This
   model study shows that adsorption in the pumped aquifer has an overall
   retardation effect on solute movement in the whole system.  Adsorption
   in the aquitard does not significantly affect solute movement in the
   pumped aquifer.  Type curves are prepared to indicate whether the
   unpumped aquifer would be contaminated by the injection into the pumped
   aquifer.  Pumping rate is an important hydraulic factor determining the
   leakage conditions of an aquifer (in addition to some hydrogeological
   conditions of the systems).  Analytical solutions are obtained for
   steady-state conditions.  For transient conditions, however, only
   semianalytical solutions can be determined by numerically inverting the
   solutions of the model in the Laplace transform domain.}},

Abstract = {{Two liquid harzardous wastes (an alkaline brine-like solution and a
   dilute acidic waste) were mixed with finely ground rock samples of three
   injection-related lithologies (sandstone, dolomite, and siltstone) for
   155 to 230 days at 325-degrees-K-10.8 MPa. The pH and inorganic chemical
   composition of the alkaline waste were not significantly altered by any
   of the rock samples after 230 days of mixing. The acidic waste was
   neutralized as a consequence of carbonate dissolution, ion exchange, or
   clay-mineral dissolution, and hence was transformed into a nonhazardous
   waste.
   Mixing the alkaline waste with the solid phases yielded several reaction
   products: brucite, Mg(OH)2; calcite, CaCO3; and possibly a type of
   sodium metasilicate. Clay-like minerals formed in the sandstone, and
   hydrotalcite, Mg6Al2CO3(OH)16.4H2O, may have formed in the siltstone at
   trace levels. Mixing the alkaline waste with a synthetic brine yielded
   brucite, calcite, and whewellite (CaC2O4.H2O). The thermodynamic model
   PHRQPITZ predicted that brucite and calcite would precipitate from
   solution in the dolomite and siltstone mixtures and in the alkaline
   waste-brine system.
   The dilute acidic waste did not significantly alter the mineralogical
   composition of the three rock types after 155 days of contact. The model
   PHREEQE indicated that the calcite was thermodynamically stable in the
   dolomite and siltstone mixtures, and was detected in small quantities in
   aged-solid samples. The sandstone-waste system appeared to equilibrate
   with amorphous silica, whereas silica equilibria may not have been
   attained in the dolomite and siltstone systems.
   Computer models like PHRQPITZ and PHREEQE may be useful tools for
   estimating mineral equilibria in deep-well scenarios, but there is a
   need to expand the database used in these kinds of calculations. Caution
   must be applied in interpreting the predicted equilibria. Fate modeling
   based on thermodynamic principles can predict simple geochemical
   interactions, but empirical, laboratory-based investigations may be
   needed in addition to modeling for a reliable assessment of the fate of
   injected wastes.}},

Abstract = {{Equations describing the three-phase equilibrium of contaminants between
   the pore-gas, pore-water, and solid-sorbed phases in the unsaturated
   zone are presented.  These relationships are then used to derive general
   expressions for the temperature-dependence of the equilibrium in a
   three-phase system, and those relationships are applied to derive
   expressions for the temperature-dependence of the concentrations in the
   three phases when the total contaminant mass present and the gas-filled
   and water-filled porosities are constant.  The temperature-dependence of
   the three-phase equilibrium is dictated by the enthalpies of phase
   transition and the appropriate equilibrium constants.  As the
   temperature increases, contaminants move from the more-dense to the
   less-dense phases, so that the pore-gas-phase concentration increases to
   an upper limit; the pore-water-phase concentration increases, reaches a
   maximum, and then decreases; and the solid-sorbed concentration
   decreases.  Equations describing the effects of changes in the
   water-filled porosity, such as those that would be caused by
   infiltration of either clean or contaminated pore water, on the
   gas-phase and pore-water-phase concentrations of contaminants are
   presented.  For compounds with a Henry's Law constant (H, dimensionless)
   greater than one, an increase in water-filled porosity results in an
   increase in the pore-gas concentration, while for compounds with H less
   than one, such a change results in a decrease in the pore-gas
   concentration.  The applicability of the thermodynamic relationships
   developed is limited by the assumption of ideal-gas behavior, isothermal
   phase transition, and isobaric conditions.  The stoichiometric
   relationships developed are limited by the assumption of complete
   mixing.  They are used to develop equations that allow calculation of
   the equilibrium fraction of the total contaminant mass present in each
   phase on the basis of pore-gas monitoring data, site properties, and
   equilibrium constants.  Based on observed natural seasonal changes in
   subsurface temperatures and moisture contents, the effects predicted in
   the derived equations could result in significant changes in gas-phase
   concentrations without changes in the total contaminant mass present.}},

Abstract = {{To show the effect of sorption model selection, the one-dimensional
   transport of naphthalene in two saturated porous media was simulated
   using numerical models, which included the processes of dispersion,
   advection, and sorption.  Three different models describing the sorption
   process:  (1) a local equilibrium model, (2) a first-order kinetic
   sorption model, and (3) a two-site model (a combination of equilibrium
   and kinetic sorption model), were examined.  In addition, this study
   considered two types of boundary conditions:  constant concentration and
   constant flux boundary conditions.  Simulations were made for data of
   naphthalene transport through a laboratory soil column packed with
   Lincoln or Eustis soil series.  Numerical simulation results show that
   the selection of the sorption model had significant effects on the
   numerical solutions.  The numerical solution obtained using either the
   local equilibrium model or the first-order kinetic sorption model
   described the experimental data very well from the Lincoln soil column. 
   In contrast, the numerical solution obtained using the two-site model
   described the experimental data for the Eustis soil better than either
   the equilibrium or kinetic models.  Different boundary conditions had
   little influence on the numerical solutions.  Different amounts of
   organic carbon in the Eustis (0.66\%) and Lincoln (0.036\%) soils are
   thought to cause the differences in breakthrough curves and the response
   to the sorption processes.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional analysis of ground-water flow using graphical flow net
   analysis or numerical modeling is applied to many field settings. 
   However, the assumption of hydrostatic head conditions, implicit in
   two-dimensional depth-averaged planimetric analyses, is not correct for
   situations where there is vertical flow such as near a partially
   penetrating stream.  Vertical flow is particularly important when
   predicting flow paths for contaminant transport.  An analytical solution
   is presented, which calculates the flow paths in the vicinity of a
   partially penetrating stream.  The derivation assumes radial flow
   towards the stream in the vicinity of the stream, and predominantly
   horizontal Dupuit flow in the remainder of the region.  The analytical
   solution may be used as a correction to apply to flow paths generated by
   two-dimensional analysis, or as a screening tool to determine the error
   when vertical flow is neglected by two-dimensional analysis.  To verify
   the analytical solution, it is compared to numerical simulations of
   three-dimensional flow in an idealized aquifer for a number of cases
   with varying degrees of hydraulic conductivity anisotropy.  An example
   illustrates the use of the analytical solution.  For the example
   presented, two-dimensional analysis can underestimate the distance which
   a contaminant travels before discharging into the stream by almost a
   mile.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of selenium in agricultural drain water from the western
   San Joaquin Valley, California, has focused concern on the semiconfined
   ground-water flow system, which is underlain by the Corcoran Clay Member
   of the Tulare Formation.  A two-step procedure is used to calibrate a
   preliminary model of the system for the purpose of determining the
   steady-state hydraulic properties.  Horizontal and vertical hydraulic
   conductivities are modeled as functions of the percentage of coarse
   sediment, hydraulic conductivities of coarse-textured (K(coarse)) and
   fine-textured (K(fine)) end members, and averaging methods used to
   calculate equivalent hydraulic conductivities.  The vertical
   conductivity of the Corcoran (K(corc)) is an additional parameter to be
   evaluated.
   In the first step of the calibration procedure, the model is run by
   systematically varying the following variables:  (1) K(coarse)/K(fine),
   (2) K(coarse)/K(corc), and (3) choice of averaging methods in the
   horizontal and vertical directions.  Root mean square error and bias
   values calculated from the model results are functions of these
   variables.  These measures of error provide a means for evaluating model
   sensitivity and for selecting values of K(coarse), K(fine), and K(corc)
   for use in the second step of the calibration procedure.  In the second
   step, recharge rates are evaluated as functions of K(coarse), K(corc),
   and a combination of averaging methods.  The associated K(fine) values
   are selected so that the root mean square error is minimized on the
   basis of the results from the first step.
   The results of the two-step procedure indicate that the spatial
   distribution of hydraulic conductivity that best produces the measured
   hydraulic head distribution is created through the use of arithmetic
   averaging in the horizontal direction and either geometric or harmonic
   averaging in the vertical direction.  The equivalent hydraulic
   conductivities resulting from either combination of averaging methods
   compare favorably to field- and laboratory-based values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the behavior of dense, nonaqueous phase liquids
   (DNAPLs) in fractured clay and rock.  The conditions under which a DNAPL
   will enter an initially water-saturated, rough-walled fracture are
   outlined and expressed in a number of ways, including the height to
   which a DNAPL pool can accumulate above a fracture prior to initial
   entry.  To study the behavior of DNAPL in a rough-walled fracture
   following initial entry, numerical simulations are carried out both in
   the plane of a fracture using a discrete representation of fracture
   roughness, and at a larger scale of averaging using an equivalent
   homogeneous porous media approach.  The simulations illustrate that
   DNAPL will migrate through the larger aperture regions of a fracture
   plane, and that the DNAPL has the potential to enter progressively
   smaller aperture fractures with depth as it migrates.  Additional
   numerical simulations indicate that the time taken for a nonaqueous
   phase liquid to traverse a fractured aquitard is inversely proportional
   to the fracture aperture, the fracture dip from the horizontal, and the
   height of the pool collected above the aquitard.  It is also
   demonstrated that upward hydraulic gradients across a fractured aquitard
   can significantly slow the downward rate of DNAPL migration while
   downward water gradients enhance the rate of DNAPL migration across the
   aquitard.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous paper Gibbons (1990) derived nonparametric prediction
   limits that are applicable to ground-water monitoring applications.  The
   nonparametric prediction limit was defined as the maximum of n
   historical measurements (e.g., taken from upgradient wells), denoted
   X(max, n), and was designed to include one of m future measurements in
   each of k monitoring wells.  In this way, an owner/operator who failed
   an initial sample but passed any one of m - 1 resamples would be
   considered in compliance.  In this paper, these limits are modified so
   that m - 1 out of m future measurements in each of k monitoring wells

Abstract = {{A stochastic approach to steady-state time-related capture zone
   determination that is based on the conditional simulation of hydraulic
   conductivity is presented.  Conditional simulation of hydraulic
   conductivity preserves the spatial correlation structure of the real
   hydraulic conductivity field as well as the measured, or known, values
   of hydraulic conductivity at sampling locations, thereby optimizing the
   use of available data and providing the most representative results
   possible.  The stochastic analysis methodology utilizing conditional
   simulation is applied to a hypothetical ground-water system with a water
   supply well to estimate uncertainty in the 1-year and 10-year capture
   zones of the well.  The results demonstrate the influence of known
   hydraulic conductivity values on the estimates of uncertainty, as well
   as the behavior of the ``zone of uncertainty{''} of the capture zone as
   a function of travel time and orientation of regional flow.  The results
   have significant implications regarding strategies for sampling aquifer
   properties (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) for capture zone delineation
   and for interpretation of the effects of hydraulic conductivity
   uncertainty on capture zones.}},

Abstract = {{A finite-difference ground-water flow model linked to a
   particle-tracking routine was used to determine ground-water flow paths
   and residence times in the Cambrian-Ordovician sandstone aquifer of
   eastern Wisconsin.  The modeled region was a cross section along an
   approximate flow line that included the boundary between unconfirmed and
   confined conditions in the aquifer.  Modeling results indicate that
   lower conductivity units within the sandstone aquiter produce vertically
   stratified flow in the confined region.  These simulation results help
   explain chemical signatures of ground water in different parts of the
   aquifer.  Three distinct regions of the flow system are identified:  the
   unconfined zone where vertical mixing across the aquifer yields a
   homogeneous chemistry, the shallow part of the confined zone where
   sodium and sulfate charged water from the Maquoketa Shale mixes with
   water that has migrated from the unconfined area, and the deeper region
   of the confined aquifer, containing older water that entered the system
   in the unconfined area.  Radium activities in ground water increase with
   distance along flow paths predicted by the simulation, consistent with a
   low concentration source of solid phase uranium and release of decay
   products to ground water by desorption and dissolution throughout the
   sandstone aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{A multiport permeameter was developed for use in estimating hydraulic
   conductivity over intact sections of aquifer core using the core liner
   as the permeameter body.  Six cores obtained from one borehole through
   the upper 9 m of a stratified glacial-outwash aquifer were used to
   evaluate the reliability of the permeameter.  Radiographs of the cores
   were used to assess core integrity and to locate 5- to 10-cm sections of
   similar grain size for estimation of hydraulic conductivity.  After
   extensive testing of the permeameter, hydraulic conductivities were
   determined for 83 sections of the six cores.  Other measurement
   techniques included permeameter measurements on repacked sections of
   core, estimates based on grain-size analyses, and estimates based on
   borehole flowmeter measurements.  Permeameter measurements of 33
   sections of core that had been extruded, homogenized, and repacked did
   not differ significantly from the original measurements.  Hydraulic
   conductivities estimated from grain-size distributions were slightly
   higher than those calculated from permeameter measurements; the
   significance of the difference depended on the estimating equation used.
   Hydraulic conductivities calculated from field measurements, using a
   borehole flowmeter in the borehole from which the cores were extracted,
   were significantly higher than those calculated from laboratory
   measurements and more closely agreed with independent estimates of
   hydraulic conductivity based on tracer movement near the borehole.  This
   indicates that hydraulic conductivities based on laboratory measurements
   of core samples may underestimate actual field hydraulic conductivities
   in this type of stratified glacial-outwash aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Multiobjective strategies and models for optimizing the short-term
   containment of a 2-D ground-water contaminant plume are compared.  These
   are designed for cases in which an appropriate means of treating the
   contaminated water is unavailable or unauthorized, and the management
   goal is to prevent plume movement, without pumping contaminated water
   and without importing or exporting water.  Because optimal unsteady
   strategies are usually more efficient than optimal steady strategies at
   achieving goals at a prespecified time, the models optimize the needed
   time-varying rates of extracting and injecting water.  The objective
   function can use coefficients to consider, one at a time, the objectives
   of minimizing final hydraulic gradients between observation wells and
   the plume source, minimizing the cost of pumping, or minimizing the
   volume of pumping.  Alternatively, the model can simultaneously consider
   the gradient objective and one of the other two objectives in developing
   a compromise strategy.  If the plume must be contained only for the
   period of optimal unsteady pumping, either the minimizing cost or the
   minimizing pumping volume objective is most appropriate.  For short
   periods, a minimum pumping strategy, which is the easiest to use, is
   almost the same as a least-cost strategy.  If the plume must be
   contained for a longer period, the hydraulic objective becomes
   increasingly important because it causes a more horizontal
   potentiometric surface, and less additional pumping is needed to
   maintain that surface after the end of unsteady pumping.}},

Abstract = {{Two case studies are presented as examples of a decision-analysis
   approach to engineering design for projects in which the hydrogeological
   environment plays an important role.  This approach to design involves
   quantifying benefits, costs, and risks for each design alternative under
   consideration.  Risk, which is defined as the expected costs of failure,
   reflects both performance uncertainties and failure costs. 
   Probabilities of failure are estimated by coupling stochastic
   ground-water flow and solute transport models with uncertainty models
   that represent input parameters as random variables.  The case studies
   that are used to describe the approach involve (1) selecting a pumping
   rate for an extraction well to capture an existing contaminant plume,
   and (2) designing a leachate collection system for a soil remediation
   facility.  The examples illustrate that the decision-analysis approach
   can be accomplished using relatively simple analytical models to
   simulate the behaviors of hydrogeological environments and engineering
   components.  The results identify how the preferred design alternative
   depends upon the regulatory, hydrogeological, and economic environments
   in which the decision is made.  For the extraction well example, the
   preferred alternative is relatively insensitive to the costs of failure
   but is dependent upon the expected dimensions of the contaminant plume. 
   For the soil remediation example, the preferred design alternative
   depends upon the anticipated costs of failure and the regulatory
   standard for ground-water contamination.  Reducing the variance or
   uncertainty in dispersivity values by a factor of 3 had a relatively
   small effect on the overall design of the leachate collection system.}},

Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Tidal fluctations in surface-water bodies produce progressive pressure
   waves in adjacent aquifers.  As these pressure waves propagate inland,
   ground-water levels and hydraulic gradients continuously fluctuate,
   creating a situation where a single set of water-level measurements
   cannot be used to accurately characterize ground-water flow.  For
   example, a time series of water levels measured in a confined aquifer in
   Atlantic City, New Jersey, showed that the hydraulic gradient ranged
   from .01 to .001 with a 22-degree change in direction during a tidal day
   of approximately 25 hours.  At any point where ground water tidally
   fluctuates, the magnitude and direction of the hydraulic gradient
   fluctuates about the mean or regional hydraulic gradient.  The net
   effect of these fluctuations on ground-water flow can be determined
   using the mean hydraulic gradient, which can be calculated by comparing
   mean ground-and surface-water elevations.  Filtering methods
   traditionally used to determine daily mean sea level can be similarly
   applied to ground water to determine mean levels.  Method (1) uses 71
   consecutive hourly water-level observations to accurately determine the
   mean level.  Method (2) approximates the mean level using only 25
   consecutive hourly observations; however, there is a small error
   associated with this method.  The exact magnitude of this error is
   usually unknown, and therefore the accuracy of the mean level is also
   unknown.  Method (1) should be used if a higher degree of accuracy is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Tidal fluctuation is shown to affect the piezometer readings taken in a
   nearshore aquifer around a working nuclear power station.  Continuous
   monitoring of a network of 40 piezometers provided relations between the
   tidal cycle and the piezometer readings.  These relations can be
   expressed in terms of a time lag and amplitude scaling factor.  Using
   these parameters, tidal interference was filtered from the day-to-day
   piezometer readings.  The early detection of ground-water drawdown below
   the working station caused by construction of a new nuclear power
   station on an adjacent site could thus be achieved.
   In parallel with the fieldwork, the theoretical relationship between the
   tide and piezometric response was shown to be of the same form as that
   observed in the field.  Values of the aquifer characteristics could then
   be deduced and compared with those measured in conventional pumping
   tests.  The transmission of the pressure oscillation is shown to be
   faster in areas of higher permeability and in the deeper parts of the
   aquifer.  This second effect is thought to be caused by the presence of
   the phreatic surface.}},

Abstract = {{A spill of JP-4 jet fuel at the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Traverse
   City, Michigan, contaminated a water-table aquifer.  An infiltration
   gallery (30 ft x 30 ft) was installed above a section of the aquifer
   containing 700 gal JP-4.  Purge wells recirculated three million gallons
   of ground water per week through the infiltration gallery at a rate
   designed to raise the water table above the contaminated interval. 
   Ground water containing ambient concentrations of oxygen and nitrate was
   first recirculated for 40 days.  Concentrations of benzene in monitoring
   wells beneath the infiltration gallery were reduced from 760 to <
   1-mu-g/l.  Concentrations of toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and
   o-xylene were reduced from 4500 to 17, 840 to 44, 2600 to 490, and 1400
   to 260-mu-g/l, respectively.  Average core concentrations of benzene,
   toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene, and o-xylene were reduced from 0.84
   to 0.032, 33 to 0.13, 18 to 0.36, 58 to 7.4, and 26 to 3.2 mg/kg,
   respectively.  Ground water amended with nitrate (10 mg/l
   nitrate-nitrogen) and nutrients was then recirculated for 76 days. 
   Final core concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene,
   and o-xylene were 0.017, 0.036, 0.019, 0.059, and 0.27 mg/kg,
   respectively.  Final aqueous concentrations were < 1-mu-g/l for benzene
   and toluene, 6-mu-g/l for ethylbenzene, and 20 to 40-mu-g/l for the
   xylene isomers, in good agreement with predicted values based on
   residual fuel content and partitioning theory.  Although alkylbenzene
   concentrations have been substatially reduced, the test plot is still
   contaminated with the weathered fuel.  Based on stoichiometry,
   approximately 10 times more nitrate was consumed than could be accounted
   for by BTX degradation alone, indicating that other compounds were also
   degraded under denitrifying conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The protection and cleanup of aquifers is a matter of high priority for
   all states and the federal government.  One concept that is receiving
   increased attention is that of wellhead protection.  Capture zones
   showing the area influenced by a well within a certain time are useful
   for both aquifer protection and cleanup.  If hydrodynamic dispersion is
   neglected, a deterministic curve defines the capture zone.  Analytical
   expressions for the capture zones can be derived for simple aquifers. 
   However, the capture zone equations are transcendental and connot be
   explicitly solved for the coordinates of the capture zone boundary. 
   Fortunately, an iterative scheme allows the solution to proceed quickly
   and efficiently even on a modest personal computer.  Three forms of the
   analytical solution must be used in an iterative scheme to cover the
   entire region of interest, after the extreme values of the x coordinate
   are determined by an iterative solution.  The resulting solution is a
   discrete one, and usually 100-1000 intervals along the x-axis are
   necessary for a smooth definition of the capture zone.  The presented
   program is written in FORTRAN and has been in a variety of computing
   environments.  No graphics capability is included with the program; it
   is assumed the user has access to a commercial package.  The
   superposition of capture zones for multiple wells is expected to be
   satisfactory if the spacing is not too close.  Because this program
   deals with simple aquifers, the results rarely will be the final word in
   a real application.  However, the program is useful as a first phase in
   developing wellhead protection or aquifer cleanup shcemes.}},

Abstract = {{Decomposition of organic-rich bottom sediment in a tidal creek in
   Maryland results in production of gas bubbles in the bottom sediment
   during summer and fall.  In areas where volatile organic contaminants
   discharge from ground water, through the bottom sediment, and into the
   creek, part of the volatile contamination diffuses into the gas bubbles
   and is released to the atmosphere by ebullition.  Collection and
   analysis of gas bubbles for their volatile organic contaminant content
   indicate that relative concentrations of the volatile organic
   contaminants in the gas bubbles are substantially higher in areas where
   the same contaminants occur in the ground water that discharges to the
   streams.  Analyses of the bubbles located an area of previously unknown
   ground-water contamination.
   The method developed for this study consisted of disturbing the bottom
   sediment to release gas bubbles, and then capturing the bubbles in a
   polyethylene bag at the water-column surface.  The captured gas was
   transferred either into sealable polyethylene bags for immediate
   analysis with a photoionization detector or by syringe to glass tubes
   containing wires coated with an activated-carbon adsorbent.  Relative
   concentrations were determined by mass spectral analysis for chloroform

Abstract = {{Fluorescent dyes are being used as adsorbing ground-water tracers for
   conducting solute transport studies for adsorbing organic chemicals
   (e.g., pesticides).  In this research, the ability of two fluorescent
   dyes (rhodamine WT and fluorescein) to mimic the adsorptive behavior of
   two herbicides (atrazine and alachlor) with alluvial aquifer sands was
   evaluated.  Laboratory studies (batch and column) indicated the
   following order of increasing adsorption:  fluorescein, atrazine,
   alachlor, and rhodamine WT.  Thus, the use of fluorescein and rhodamine
   WT as adsorbing ground-water tracers was observed to delimit the
   appearance of the atrazine and alachlor (fluorescein appeared before and
   rhodamine WT after the herbicides).  Several adsorption characteristics
   of the fluorescent dyes differed from those commonly observed for
   pesticides.  The levels of adsorption for the dyes were several orders
   of magnitude greater than predicted from empirical relationships based
   on K(ow) and f(oc).  The presence of divalent cations was observed to
   increase the level of rhodamine WT adsorption.  The rhodamine WT
   breakthrough curves were not of the conventional sigmoidal shape but
   instead leveled off at a C/CO value of 0.5 for a number of pore volumes
   prior to increasing again towards a C/CO value of 1.0.  These
   characteristics indicate that the adsorptive mechanisms for the
   fluorescent dyes differed from the adsorptive mechanisms for most
   pesticides.  These variations in fundamental adsorptive mechanisms raise
   concerns as to the transferability of the results of this research
   (fluorescein and rhodamine WT delimiting the appearance of atrazine and
   alachlor) to other subsurface media.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water from wells in the Cambrian-Ordovician sandstone aquifer of
   eastern Wisconsin often contains elevated concentrations of dissolved
   solids, chloride, and sulfate and locally approaches or exceeds the
   current drinking-water standard for combined radium activity.  Samples
   were collected from wells located along an approximate flow line in
   order to gain an improved understanding of the chemical evolution of
   ground water in this system.  The concentrations of chloride, sulfate,
   and sodium increase where the aquifer is confined by the Maquoketa
   Shale, and the highest combined radium activity is also found in this
   area.  Charge balance calculations and geochemical modeling indicate
   that dissolution of trace evaporite minerals and cation exchange are
   important mechanisms controlling major ion distribution.  Isotopic
   equilibrium calculations and analysis of well cuttings from one well
   with alpha-sensitive film indicate that the dissolved radionuclide
   activities are consistent with a uranium source occurring in shaly
   intervals of the sandstone aquifer at maximum local concentrations of 5
   ppm.}},

Abstract = {{Both response matrix and embedding techniques are used to compute
   optimal sustained-yield ground-water extraction strategies for confined
   aquifers.  Historically, the response matrix method has been considered
   the most practical, because of numerical instability reported to occur
   when using the embedding approach for large aquifer systems.  More
   recent studies have proven the embedding approach to be stable for
   large-scale regional planning.  Also, there is increasing emphasis on
   using microcomputers for ground-water studies.  Thus, it is appropriate
   to compare response matrix and embedding approaches to steady-state
   problems in terms of computational efficiency and memory requirements.
   For the hypothetical study area, a steady-state embedding model requires
   less processing time than a comparable response matrix model.  In
   addition, the embedding model sometimes requires less memory than a
   response matrix model.  Required computer memory is frequently a
   function of the number of nonzero values in constraint equations.  For
   embedding models, the number of nonzeroes is fixed for a particular
   study area.  For response matrix models, the number of nonzeroes can
   increase dramatically in proportion to the number of pumping cells and
   cells at which heads must be constrained.  For the sample system, if
   more than 25 percent of the cells can pump, the response matrix approach
   requires more memory than does the embedding approach.  Before selecting
   an optimization model for a particular study, one should, as
   illustrated, evaluate potential memory requirements of both embedding
   and response matrix approaches.  If there is a high percentage of
   pumping cells, or if many heads must be constrained or computed within
   the optimization model, the embedding approach seems preferable.}},

Abstract = {{A nonsteady-state model is presented for the in-situ biostimulation of a
   microbial population in saturated porous media.  The model includes
   basic processes of microbial growth, utilization of electron donor and
   acceptor, advective transport, dispersion, and sorption in porous media.
   Model simulations are compared with results from a series of controlled
   field experiments at the Moffett Naval Air Station, where the growth of
   an indigenous population of methane-utilizing bacteria (methanotrophs)
   was stimulated by the controlled addition of dissolved methane and
   oxygen (DO) into a semiconfined aquifer.  Simulations provide good
   matches to the observed transient uptake of methane and DO,
   demonstrating that the observed response resulted from the growth of
   methanotrophs in the test zone.  Simulations duplicate results from
   alternate pulsed addition of methane (electron donor) and oxygen
   (electron acceptor), used as a means for distributing microbial growth
   throughout the test zone.  The model permits estimation of changes in
   microbial population distribution at various stages of the two-year
   experiment.  Temporal changes in model-fitted kinetic parameters
   indicate that the microbial population evolved to one that more
   effectively utilized the methane at lower concentrations.  These
   analyses demonstrate that a relatively simple model, which includes
   basic microbial and transport processes, can be of use in the design and
   evaluation of in-situ biotreatment processes.  The model user, however,
   must provide judgment in the selection of appropriate input parameters,
   as well as being aware of model limitations.}},

Abstract = {{A ground-penetrating-radar system was used to study selected
   stratified-drift deposits in Connecticut.  Ground-penetrating radar is a
   surface-geophysical method that depends on the emission, transmission,
   reflection, and reception of an electromagnetic pulse and can produce
   continuous high-resolution profiles of the subsurface rapidly and
   efficiently.  Traverse locations on land included a well field in the
   town of Mansfield, a sand and gravel pit and a farm overlying a
   potential aquifer in the town of Coventry, and Haddam Meadows State Park
   in the town of Haddam.  Traverse locations on water included the
   Willimantic River in Coventry and Mansfield Hollow Lake in Mansfield. 
   The penetration depth of the radar signal ranged from about 20 feet in
   fine-grained glaciolacustrine sediments to about 70 feet in coarse sand
   and gravel.  Some land records in coarse-grained sediments show a
   distinct, continuous reflection from the water table about 5 to 11 feet
   below land surface.  Parallel reflectors on the records are interpreted
   as fine-grained sediments.  Hummocky or chaotic reflectors are
   interpreted as cross-bedded or coarse-grained sediments.  Other features
   observed on some of the radar records include the till and bedrock
   surface.  Records collected on water had distinct water-bottom multiples
   (more than one reflection) and diffraction patterns from boulders.  The

Abstract = {{Traveltime-related capture areas of wells can be estimated in
   hydrogeologic settings with predominantly two-dimensional flow regimes
   using image-well theory, the principle of superposition, an appropriate
   well-hydraulics equation, and particle-tracking analysis.  These
   analytical methods can be used to simulate the response of an aquifer to
   pumping stress by incorporating site-specific values of hydraulic
   properties, the effects of geologic and hydrologic boundaries,
   nonuniform regional hydraulic gradients, and well interferences.  This
   is done by developing a conceptual model of the flow system,
   incorporating an image-well solution (if needed), computing drawdowns at
   the intersections of a rectangular grid superposed over the area of
   interest, and subtracting computed drawdowns from regional prepumping
   head values assigned to the grid intersections.  The resulting flow
   model can be calibrated by comparing predicted heads with measured
   heads.  The calibrated head distribution then is used in a
   particle-tracking analysis to determine flowpath trajectories and
   traveltime-related capture areas of wells.
   Analytical flow models based on the Theis equation and the Hantush-Jacob
   equation were constructed from conceptual flow models based on geologic,
   hydrologic, and pumpage data from wellfields completed in a
   confined/unconfined stratified-drift aquifer and in a leaky-confined
   fractured-carbonate aquifer.  Predicted head distributions from the
   calibrated flow models were used in a particle-tracking analysis to
   compute flowpath trajectories and traveltime-related capture areas.  The
   results compare favorably with known flowpaths from sources of
   contamination proximal to each wellfield.}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{In regions where ground water is generally younger than about 30 years,
   developing the tritium input history of an area for comparison with the
   current tritium content of ground water allows quantitative estimates of
   minimum ground-water age.  The tritium input history for central
   Wisconsin has been constructed using precipitation tritium measured at
   Madison, Wisconsin and elsewhere.  Weighted tritium inputs to ground
   water reached a peak of over 2,000 TU in 1964, and have declined since
   that time to about 20-30 TU at present.
   In the Buena Vista basin in central Wisconsin, most ground-water samples
   contained elevated levels of tritium, and estimated minimum ground-water
   ages in the basin ranged from less than one year to over 33 years. 
   Ground water in mapped recharge areas was generally younger than ground
   water in discharge areas, and estimated ground-water ages were
   consistent with flow system interpretations based on other data. 
   Estimated minimum ground-water ages increased with depth in areas of
   downward ground-water movement.  However, water recharging through thick
   moraine sediments was older than water in other recharge areas,
   reflecting slower infiltration through the sandy till of the moraine.}},

   PLAIN IN SOUTHWESTERN ONTARIO}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{The St. Clair Plain in southwestern Ontario is underlain by extensive
   clayey till deposits which are generally 30 m to 40 m thick.  The tills
   have vertical fractures near the ground surface, and this study
   investigates the depth of those fractures.  Observations in test pits
   show that most weathering features along fractures reach a depth of only
   2.5 m to 4 m, though isolated major fractures extend past the pit bottom
   depth of 5.6 m at two sites.  This study also investigates the depth of
   active ground-water flow, which is defined as the ground-water flow in
   the clayey deposit which occurs in fractures.  Water-level response
   tests show bulk hydraulic conductivities of the fractured till ranging
   from > 10(-7) to 10(-8) cm/s.  Seasonal variations in hydraulic head
   profiles suggest that fractures influence ground-water flow to maximum
   depths ranging from 5 m to more than 10 m at the 10 sites studied.  The
   water table is usually within 2 m of the surface, but piezometers went
   dry to depths of 2 m to 4.9 m during dry periods in 1987 and 1988. 
   Tritium levels greater than 1 T.U., indicating the presence of post-1952
   water, are found to depths of 7.5 m at all sites and to depths exceeding
   12 m in two cases.  Tritium has moved to the base of deep, open
   fractures by active ground-water flow and has travelled 1 or 2 m beyond
   that depth by molecular diffusion.  Observations of seasonal water-level
   variations and tritium sampling show the most promise for determining
   the maximum depth of hydraulically active, vertical fractures.  The
   maximum depth of active ground-water flow in fractures varies widely,
   ranging from 5 m to more than 10 m at the 12 sites studied on the St.
   Clair Plain.}},

Abstract = {{A method has been developed to install miniature multilevel ground-water
   sampling wells in shallow, unconsolidated aquifers at sites without
   truck access.  An advantage of these wells over the traditional
   bundle-type multilevels is that this type of installation causes minimal
   aquifer disturbance.  Thus, miniature multilevels can be installed while
   a tracer test is in progress.  Furthermore, only hand tools are needed
   in the field, and equipment and materials are easily obtained and
   inexpensive.  The time required for installation is comparable to other
   methods.}},

   still contains the two unknowns, velocity and porosity. If the local
   hydraulic gradient is known and if a drift and pumpback tracer test is
   conducted at a well whose hydraulic conductivity has been determined,
   two independent functional relationships between velocity and porosity
   are established. By treating these functions as nonlinear simultaneous

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{A drain function and set of type curves were defined for a simplified
   mathematical solution that represents one-dimensional flow under
   nonsteady conditions in a leaky aquifer for the constant discharge
   boundary condition.  The mathematical solution is in the form of
   exponential and complementary error functions, and it can be calculated
   using a polynomial approximation for the complementary error function. 
   The mathematical solution and drain function are computationally easier
   to use than an equivalent integral-form solution and drain function,
   which must be integrated numerically.  A match-point procedure was
   developed for determining aquifer diffusivity (T/S), transmissivity (T),
   storage coefficient (S), and leakance (K'/b') based on using the drain
   function and type curves.  Use of the procedure is illustrated by an
   example that utilizes simulated aquifer drawdown and flowrate data.  The
   match-point procedure can be used to analyze drawdown data in leaky and
   nonleaky aquifers in cases where the flow is one-dimensional and the
   discharge from the aquifer is constant.  Applications of this procedure
   would include flow to a canal or river, flow to a highly permeable
   fracture that acts as a line sink, drainage of agricultural lands, and
   dewatering associated with strip mining operations.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing population of south Florida is creating a need for
   greater waste-water disposal capacity.  The people of Florida are
   dependent on ground water for drinking, irrigation, and other uses.  The
   emphasis on preservation of surface-water quality means that many
   surface waters are not allowed to receive effluent from municipal or
   industrial sources.  Since the 1940s, the highly transmissive zones of
   the nonpotable portion of the Floridan aquifer have served as disposal
   zones for oil field brine and later for industrial and municipal
   effluent.
   The Floridan aquifer of south Florida is a carbonate Cenozoic age
   aquifer.  Transmissivities between 0.5 and 21 million gpd/ft exist in
   cavernous and fractured sequences in the aquifer.  Confining zones that
   overlie the disposal intervals have transmissivities and hydraulic
   conductivities one to three orders of magnitude less than the injection
   intervals.  These confining zones prevent low density municipal effluent
   from rising upward through the overlying saline waters.
   This paper provides an integration of previously published work with
   recent site-specific data collected from deep injection wells drilled in
   the last two decades.}},

Abstract = {{Depth profiles of organic pollutants, metals, and anions were obtained
   using a ground-water multilayer sampler (MLS) in a sandy unconfined
   aquifer contaminated by liquid fuels.  The sampler incorporates dialysis
   membranes and is capable of obtaining vertical profiles with a
   resolution on the order of few centimeters.  Of the eight solutes
   examined (metals, organics, and anions), all except sulfate exhibited
   microscale heterogeneities in their concentration over a vertical
   interval of 200 cm.  Chloride, manganese, and iron showed a long linear
   concentration gradient versus depth which is probably the result of
   vertical mixing by rainfall input.  Maximum concentrations of toluene,
   xylene, and xylidine at the water table were 17.1, 8.3, and 17.1 mg/l,
   respectively, decreasing with depth.  For toluene and xylene the maximum
   concentrations found at the water table with the MLS are 40 and 4 times
   higher, respectively, than those detected at depths greater than 200 cm

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes topics related to colloid transport in subsurface
   media.  The ultimate objective of the paper is to present a model that
   can be used to evaluate the significance of colloid facilitated
   transport on the mobility of metals.  Field and laboratory studies are
   first reviewed to evaluate evidence that colloids are transported in
   subsurface media.  Second, researchers active in the field are contacted
   to identify areas of ongoing research, and to solicit opinions
   concerning the level of understanding of mechanisms that control colloid
   migration.  Third, the literature on colloid transport mechanisms is
   reviewed, with particular emphasis on colloid (and particle) filtration
   and on colloid stability as influenced by electrical repulsion and Van
   der Waals attraction.  Fourth, a conceptual colloids-metal transport
   model (COMET) is developed and incorporated into EPA's CML model, a
   model that simulates solute migration from a landfill in the unsaturated
   zone to a receptor (i.e., drinking-water well) in the saturated zone. 
   Among the major features of the COMET model are the capability to
   simulate multiple metal species either dissolved or adsorbed to mobile
   colloids (in conjunction with results from a geochemical equilibrium
   model), the capability to simulate the influence of multiple colloid
   types, and to adjust source concentration and duration in the presence
   of colloids that migrate from a source.  These capabilities are embodied
   in equations (2) and (3) in the main text of this paper.
   As expected, results from the COMET simulations indicate that mobile
   phase metal concentrations (dissolved concentration plus concentration
   adsorbed to mobile colloids) increase as colloid concentrations
   increase, and arrival times of soluble metal species (solutes) to
   stationary receptors decrease.  When the partition coefficients for
   solute-colloid adsorption and solute-soil matrix adsorption are the
   same, neither the increase in mobile phase concentration nor decrease in
   travel time is always significant.  However, when partition coefficients
   for solute-colloid adsorption are greater than partition coefficients
   for solute-soil matrix adsorption, travel times to stationary receptors
   can dramatically decrease and total mobile phase concentrations
   dramatically increase.}},

Abstract = {{Initial test data from a fractured, shale-dominated sequence at a
   proposed landfill site in the Appalachian Plateau exhibited an apparent
   inconsistency:  the unit performed in some ways as an aquitard; yet it
   was capable of high well yields which suggested it was an aquifer.  High
   head drops (tens of feet) and dramatic ground-water quality differences
   (hundreds of ppm for sulfate) occurred across the shale indicating that
   it is an aquitard.  However, the shale sequence supported yields up to
   60 gpm in test wells and one production well.  This inconsistency
   suggested high anisotropy in vertical versus horizontal hydraulic
   conductivity.
   A second detailed stage of testing confirmed the coincidence of some
   yielding zones to more brittle interbeds and bedding fractures within
   the shale sequence.  An approach involving several different techniques,
   including analysis of hydrographs, vertical gradients, ground-water
   quality differences, borehole geophysical logs, and pumping tests, was
   found to be effective in aquifer-aquitard delineation at this site.  The
   study showed that in waste disposal investigations in the Appalachian
   Plateau, it is inappropriate to use well yield alone to identify
   aquitards as these may be complex with numerous interlayered aquifers.}},

   of nonhazardous wastes if the compliance distance was 100 feet.  With a

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine the stability of five commonly
   used herbicides fortified into freshly collected ground water.  No
   aquifer materials were present.  Ground-water samples obtained from
   three sites in eastern Arkansas were fortified with an aqueous mixture
   containing either the chloroacetamide herbicides, alachlor, metolachlor,
   and propanil, or the phenoxy herbicides, 2,4-D and dichlorprop. 
   Experiments were conducted at temperatures comparable to Arkansas'
   extreme ground-water temperatures, 15 and 22-degrees-C, and at initial
   concentrations of 1 and 5-mu-g/l.  Degradation occurring for each
   herbicide was determined at two-month intervals, for a period of 18
   months.
   Results indicated that degradation did not begin immediately, but
   generally required a lag period of several months.  Of the five
   herbicides studied, propanil degraded the fastest and to the greatest
   extent.  After eight months, 44\% to 69\% of propanil at the lower
   fortification level and 85\% to 99\% at the higher level had degraded. 
   The remaining four herbicides exhibited little or no degradation at the
   lower concentration during the first 12 months.  By 18 months, however,
   significant degradation of each herbicide had occurred.  Degradation
   generally occurred earlier for each herbicide at the higher
   fortification level.  With the exception of 2,4-D, a higher percentage
   of herbicide was broken down at the greater fortification level. 
   Degradation was more extensive at the elevated storage temperature.  In
   general, the degradation rate was faster in ground water taken from
   shallower depths.  Zero-order rate constants and half-lives are
   presented.  Half-lives, including lag periods, ranged from 196 to 1907
   days.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines hydrogeologic effects of proposed diversion of water
   from the Mediterranean Sea to the Qattara Depression for generation of
   electricity in northwestern Egypt.  The Lower Miocene Moghra aquifer
   directly underlies the Qattara Depression, extending to the east and
   dipping beneath younger formations to the north.  The Qattara Depression
   is a sink for ground-water flow from the Nile Delta aquifer in the east,
   the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Nubian artesian aquifer in
   the south.  In this study, a two-dimensional finite-difference model was
   used in conjunction with available meteorologic, geologic, and
   hydrologic data to characterize the present ground-water conditions in
   this aquifer and to make predictions about the water-table rise which
   could occur as a result of the proposed Qattara Reservoir.  Model
   predictions indicate that creation of the reservoir could cause a
   30-meter rise of the Moghra aquifer's water table in the central part of
   the Qattara Depression.  This water-table rise decreases to the north
   and east.  Transient simulations indicate that steady-state conditions
   in the modeled area of the Moghra aquifer are not likely to be reached
   during the expected 100-year lifetime of the reservoir.}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented that demonstrate the in-situ biotransformation of
   vinyl chloride (VC), trans-1,2-dichloroethylene (t-DCE),
   cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (c-DCE), and trichloroethylene (TCE) by an
   enhanced population of methane-utilizing (methanotrophic) bacteria. 
   Biostimulation was accomplished by introducing dissolved methane and
   oxygen into a shallow, confined aquifer, to encourage the growth of the
   native methanotrophic bacteria.  Biotransformation of the target
   compounds ensued immediately after the commencement of methane
   utilization, and reached steady-state values within three weeks.  The
   approximate extents of transformation achieved in the two meter
   biostimulated zone were as follows:  VC, 95\%; t-DCE, 90\%; c-DCE, 50\%;
   and TCE, 20\%.  The biotransformation of VC and t-DCE was observed to be
   competitively inhibited by methane.  Cyclic variations in methane
   concentration caused by the alternate pulse injection of dissolved
   methane into the test zone caused oscillations of the aqueous
   concentrations of VC and t-DCE.  When formate and methanol were
   substituted for methane as alternative electron donors, inhibition
   ceased (no oscillations), and concentrations were reduced to levels
   achieved during periods when no methane was present, confirming the
   inhibition by methane.  Higher transformation rates were achieved
   temporarily, i.e., for several days, through the addition of formate or
   methanol.  When electron donor addition was terminated, the
   concentration of target compounds rapidly increased, indicating that the
   transformation promptly ceased.  Although these experiments indicated
   that methane competitively inhibits transformation rates, this
   competition is a second-order effect:  methane as substrate for growth
   was also required for transformation of VC, t-DCE, c-DCE, and TCE by
   methanotrophs.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model, VIROTRANS, is developed for simulating the vertical
   movement of water and virus through soils treated with waste-water
   effluents and sewage sludges.  The expression describing transient flow
   of water is coupled with the convective-dispersive equation for
   subsurface solute transport.  The resulting methodology is a coupled set
   of partial differential equations that describe the transient flow of
   water and suspended virus particle movement through variably saturated
   media.  Solutions to the partial differential equations are accomplished
   by a Galerkin finite element method.  Several example problems are used
   to provide a quantitative verification and validation of the model.  The
   model simulations are compared to an analytical solution and to
   experimental measurements of soil moisture content and poliovirus 1
   transport.  The comparisons show reasonable agreement between model
   simulations and measured data.  Sensitivity of the model's prediction to
   variations in pertinent input parameters are also analyzed.}},

   the VOCs.  The retardation of the volatile compounds 1,4-dioxane,
   tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform,
   1,1-dichloroethene, and benzene was measured.  The centers of mass of
   both the contaminant and conservative tracer breakthrough curves were
   compared to determine R(f).  The measured R(f) values ranged from 1.1
   (1,4-dioxane) to 14.3 (benzene) compared with values of 1.6 and 8.8

Abstract = {{Forty passive vapor samplers were placed in creek-bottom sediment in an
   area where ground water contaminated with volatile organic compounds is
   discharging to surface water.  The vapor samplers were composed of
   activated carbon fused to a ferromagnetic wire in a test tube.  The
   samplers were analyzed in a laboratory using an extranuclear quadrupole
   mass spectrometer.  Data from the samplers reveal distributions of
   chloroform, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and benzene in the
   bottom sediment that closely correspond to the discribution of those
   compounds in the adjacent ground water.  Moreover, concentrations of
   tetrachloroethylene in bottom sediment estimated from the samplers are
   similar to those measured in observation wells near the shoreline. 
   Thus, the vapor samplers may be used to locate and map areas where
   contaminated ground water is being discharged to surface water and to
   determine the approximate concentrations of specific contaminants in the
   discharging ground water.}},

   possibility of calculating a resistivity response in advance offers a
   tool to optimize electrode configurations and spacings, and hence
   greatly improves the value of the measurements.  A better insight is
   also obtained into how geological structures may affect the size and

   the sensitivity of Schlumberger and Wenner arrays to the weathered layer

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-25}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Under freezing or near-freezing conditions, temperature-induced
   viscosity changes, solute immobilization, and solute exclusion can
   affect field-scale solute transport in ground water.  This can lead to
   concentration profiles significantly different from those predicted by
   models which do not account for these processes.  A model (GWFREEZE) is
   presented which incorporates these processes into a two-dimensional
   transport equation for saturated porous media subject to a hydraulic
   head field that does not vary with time.
   Ground-water temperature can be expected to vary widely in some natural
   and artificial freezing and near-freezing situations.  Spatially varying
   temperature fields cause spatial variations in the fluid viscosity
   field, especially near 0-degrees-C, where viscosity varies faster with
   temperature than at higher temperatures.  GWFREEZE models these
   phenomena with a viscosity-dependent hydraulic conductivity that is a
   function of temperature.  Solute exclusion is modeled by a variable
   exclusion coefficient (K(e)) which represents the percentage of solute
   excluded at the freezing front.  The freezing front is modeled as a
   planar no-flow boundary behind which solutes are immobilized and at
   which solutes are excluded.}},

Abstract = {{A tritium profile obtained from a core located on the Tipton Till Plain
   near West Lafayette, Indiana, showed a ``tritium reversal{''}
   (corresponding to a low-high-low activity of tritium relative to depth)
   at 7 m, indicating the present position of recharge water derived from
   1963/64 precipitation.  The average recharge rate calculated using the
   tritium data is 3.5 cm/yr for the ``mass-balance{''} method and 4.7
   cm/yr for the ``transit-time{''} method.  The average of 4.1 cm/yr is in
   reasonable agreement with Arihood's (1982) estimate of 5.1 cm/yr for
   tills, based on numerical modeling of data from a water-budget study in
   the White River basin of Indiana.  Two other cores, located on a nearby
   topographically lower slope, showed no definite reversal in tritium
   activity, probably because of lateral flow components at these
   locations.
   To be applied, the tritium technique should assess the contribution of
   summer and winter precipitation to recharge because tritium activities
   tend to peak in spring and summer precipitation.  Contrary to the usual
   assumptions that recharge to aquifers in temperate zones of the northern
   hemisphere occurs between October and April, stable isotopic data of
   well water in the study area indicate that an appreciable amount of
   annual recharge (about 34\%) actually occurs between April and October.}},

Abstract = {{Thousands of leaking underground gasoline tanks have been found
   throughout California from which a tremendous amount of gasoline has
   leaked into ground water over the last half century.  The most
   water-soluble constituent of gasoline is benzene, and it typically
   contaminates ground water below leaking underground tanks.  In a
   state-mandated program 7,167 wells serving water-supply systems
   throughout California were tested for a broad panel of organic
   contaminants.  Of the wells tested, 812 (11.3\%) had detectable
   concentrations of at least one of the contaminants tested for. 
   Detectable concentrations of benzene were reported for only 10 wells. 
   Similar findings were reported in surveys focused on San Gabriel and San
   Fernando Basins.  While many processes influence the environmental fates
   of organic contaminants in ground water, the most likely explanation for
   the nonoccurrence of benzene is that it is destroyed near its source by
   biodegradation.}},

Abstract = {{The aqueous geochemistry of the sand-and-gravel aquifer in northwest
   Florida was characterized as part of the Florida Ground- Water Quality
   Monitoring Network Program, a multiagency cooperative study delineating
   baseline and/or background water quality for the major aquifer systems
   throughout the State.  The aquifer is the principal source of water in
   northwest Florida and consists predominantly of quartz sand with smaller
   amounts of andesine, chlorite, calcite, kaolinite, and illite.  Water
   from 42 wells in the sand-and-gravel aquifer sampled during 1986 and
   1987 was characteristically low in dissolved solids (median value of 72
   milligrams per liter) and of nondistinct water type, although relative
   concentrations of magnesium and sulfate tended to be lower than those of
   other major ions.  Nonparametric statistical tests of major-ion
   concentration variations with depth and relative distance along flow
   paths indicate that the water chemistry does not change significantly
   (0.05 significance level) as the water moves vertically and laterally
   through the aquifer.  Mass-balance calculations indicate that dissolved
   solids from rainfall and saline-water sources each account for 13
   percent of the concentration of dissolved solids in ground water. 
   Incongruent dissolution of andesine, chlorite, and muscovite to form
   kaolinite accounts for 94 percent of the neutralization of the total
   hydrogen ion input from rainfall and from carbonic acid weathering in
   the subsurface.  The remaining neutralization is accounted for by the
   dissolution of calcite.}},

Abstract = {{Results from analysis of models of heterogeneous porous media indicate
   that inverse plume analysis has potential for use in delineating zones
   of differing characteristics within porous media even when the zones are
   not penetrated by a borehole.  By analyzing the concentrations at pairs
   of points in a contaminant plume, the spatial distributions of apparent
   transverse dispersivity and source size are determined.  Since
   dispersivity is an intrinsic property of a porous medium, spatial
   distributions of the apparent dispersivities obtained from inverse
   analysis of plumes are an indication of transitions in the character of
   the porous medium.
   Dispersivity values obtained by inverse plume analysis in heterogeneous
   porous media are ``apparent{''} because the equation on which the
   analysis is based was developed under the assumption that the porous
   media is isotropic and homogeneous.  In the case of heterogeneous porous
   media, the dispersivity value obtained at a given location by inverse
   plume analysis is affected by the spreading of the plume through
   different materials.  Therefore, variations in dispersivity should be
   interpreted qualitatively for delineation of heterogeneity and not
   quantitatively as for input to numerical transport models.}},

Abstract = {{Protection of ground-water resources from the effects of anthropogenic
   contamination requires definition of the source of water flowing in
   developed aquifers.  Aquifer recharge areas for the confined Magothy and
   Lloyd aquifers of Long Island, New York, are estimated by using a
   three-dimensional model of the Long Island ground-water flow system and
   a particle-tracking algorithm.
   Aquifer recharge areas under predevelopment conditions are consistent
   with an understanding of the ground-water flow system operation.  A
   budget comparison indicated that the recharge occurring in each area as
   calculated by particle tracking was within one percent of the flow
   entering that aquifer, according to the water budget computed from the
   flow model.
   Aquifer recharge areas for two stressed conditions, one at the present
   time and the other and estimate for the year 2020, are more difficult to
   define because of numerous pumped wells.  Maximum and minimum recharge
   areas for each aquifer are presented for both present conditions and the
   year 2020 to bracket the actual aquifer recharge areas.  These results
   also are consistent with the water budgets computed from the flow model.
   Results indicate that development causes large-scale changes in flow
   patterns and the size and shape of aquifer recharge areas.  The accuracy
   of defining recharge areas is limited by the model's representation of
   local-scale characteristics of the flow system and the wells.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Seepage of ground water to Green Bay and Lake Michigan from a fractured
   dolomite aquifer beneath the Door Peninsula of Wisconsin is examined to
   determine the influences of embayments on the relative amounts of
   ground-water discharge.  A digital simulation has been used to calculate
   the quantity and distribution of that discharge.  The simulated results
   are based on the net recharge which occurs on the land portion of the
   study area.  They compare favorably with discharges calculated by flow
   net using observed hydraulic gradients and conductivities, and are in
   relative agreement with direct measurements made by seepage meters.  The
   simulation has not been verified (due to lack of independent
   observations), but the similarity of the discharges from the three
   methods is argued to indicate the model's validity.
   In the study area, 66,000 m3/day of ground water is discharged directly
   to Green Bay (26,000 m3/day) and Lake Michigan (40,000 m3/day).  Almost
   60\% of this total occurs in 20 embayments along the shore, even though
   they occupy only about 33\% of the shoreline length as measured parallel
   to the long axis of the peninsula.
   Discharge is focused into embayments by distortion of equipotential
   lines caused by a bay's penetration into the ground-water system.  In
   the study area, it is shown that flow amplifications of up to 500\% vary
   directly with two measures of the shoreline shape at bays, horizontal
   penetration (defined as the ratio of a bay's axial length to the
   distance to the ground-water divide), and vertical penetration (the
   ratio of the maximum bay depth to aquifer thickness).  Both factors have
   equal influence on the amplification of discharge.  A graphical means of
   predicting the effect of coastal configuration on other bays is
   presented, but its applicability outside the study area is unknown.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1991}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{82-92}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Distinct plumes of septic system-impacted ground water at two
   single-family homes located on shallow unconfined sand aquifers in
   Ontario showed elevated levels of Cl-, NO3-, Na+, Ca2+, K+, alkalinity,
   and dissolved organic carbon and depressed levels of pH and dissolved
   oxygen.  At the Cambridge site, in use 12 years, the plume had sharp
   lateral and vertical boundaries and was more than 130 m in length with a
   uniform width of about 10 m.  As a result of low transverse disperison
   in the aquifer, mobile plume solutes such as NO3- and Na+ occurred at
   more than 50 percent of the source concentrations 130 m downgradient
   from the septic system.  At the Muskoka site, in use three years, the
   plume also had discrete boundaries reflecting low transverse dispersion.
   After 1.5 years of system operation, the Muskoka plume began discharging
   to a river located 20 m from the tile field.  Almost complete NO3-
   attenuation was observed within the last 2 m of the plume flowpath
   before discharge to the river.  This was attributed to denitrification
   occurring within organic matter-enriched reverbed sediments.
   The very weakly dispersive nature of the two aquifers was consistent
   with the results of recently reported naturalgradient tracer tests in
   sands.  Therefore, for many unconfined sand aquifers, the minimum
   distance-to-well regulations for permitting septic systems in most parts
   of North America should not be expected to be adequately protective of
   well-water quality in situations where mobile contaminants such as NO3-
   are not attenuated by chemical or microbiological processes.}},

Abstract = {{The residential areas of Kuwait City have been affected by a rise in the
   subsurface-water level in recent years, causing waterlogging and
   flooding of the basements of buildings.  To study this phenomenon, and
   to ascertain its causes, a numerical aquifer simulation model was
   developed.  The aquifer model showed that, over the period 1961-1985,
   the net yearly addition to the aquifer storage due to the contribution
   from man-made sources like sewage systems, irrigation, and water
   distribution networks, ranged from 8,300 to 10,100 m3 d-1, causing a
   subsurface-water-level rise of about 5 m locally, resulting in high
   water-table conditions.  A maximum local rise in the water table of 2.5
   m was predicted between the end of 1985 and 1990, if no remedial actions
   are undertaken.  Preventive methods to reduce or eliminate recharge from
   man-made activities would help control the water-level rise and even
   lower the water table in affected areas.  Remedial measures to lower and
   maintain the subsurface-water level at acceptable depths would entail
   the withdrawal of significant quantities of ground water.}},
