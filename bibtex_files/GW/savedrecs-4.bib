Abstract = {{One of the major problems in the lower Jordan Valley is the increasing
   salinization (i.e., chloride content) of local ground water. The high
   levels of salinity limit the utilization of ground water for both
   domestic and agriculture applications. This joint collaborative study
   evaluates the sources and mechanisms for salinization in the Jericho
   area. We employ diagnostic geochemical fingerprinting methods to trace
   the potential sources of the salinity in (1) the deep confined
   subaquifer system (K2) of Lower Cenomanian age; (2) the upper subaquifer
   system (K1) of Upper Cenomanian and Turonian ages; and (3) the shallow
   aquifer system (Q) of Plio-Pleistocene ages.
   The chemical composition of the saline ground water from the two
   Cenomanian subaquifers (K1 and K2) point to a single saline source with
   Na/Cl similar to0.5 and Br/Cl similar to7 X 10(-3), This composition is
   similar to that of thermal hypersaline springs that are found along the
   western shore of the Dead Sea (e.g., En Gedi thermal spring). We suggest
   that the increasing salinity in both K1 and K2 subaquifers is derived
   from mixing with deep-seated brines that flow through the Rift fault
   system. The salinization rate depends on the discharge volume of the
   fresh meteoric water in the Cenomanian Aquifer, In contrast, the
   chemical composition of ground water from the Plio-Pleistocene Aquifer
   shows a wide range of CT (100-2000 mg/L), Na/Cl (0.4-1.0), Br/CI (2-6 x
   10(-3)), and SO4Cl (0.01-0.4) ratios. These variations, together with
   the high SO42-, K+, and NO3- concentrations, suggest that the salinity
   in the shallow aquifer is derived from the combination of (1) upconing
   of deep brines as reflected by low Na/Cl and high Br/CI ratios; (2)
   leaching of salts from the Lisan Formation within the Plio-Pleistocene
   Aquifer, as suggested by the high SO42- concentrations; and (3)
   anthropogenic contamination of agriculture return flow and sewage
   effluents with distinctive high K+ (80 mg/L) and NO3-(80 mg/L) contents
   and low Br/Cl ratios (2 x 10-3). Our data demonstrates that the chemical
   composition of salinized ground water can be used to delineate the
   sources of salinity and hence to establish the conceptual model for
   explaining salinization processes.}},

Abstract = {{Discharges of polluted water from abandoned mines are a major cause of
   degradation of water resources worldwide, Pollution arises after
   abandoned workings flood up to surface level, by the process termed
   ground water rebound, As flow in large, open mine voids is often
   turbulent, standard techniques for modeling ground water flow (which
   assume laminar flow) are inappropriate for predicting ground water
   rebound. More physically realistic models are therefore desirable, yet
   these are often expensive to apply to all but the smallest of systems.
   An overall strategy for ground water rebound modeling is proposed, with
   models of decreasing complexity applied as the temporal and spatial
   scales of the systems under analysis increase. For relatively modest
   systems (area < 200 km(2)), a physically based modeling approach has
   been developed, in which 3-D pipe networks (representing major mine
   roadways, etc.) are routed through a variably saturated, 3-D porous
   medium (representing the country rock). For systems extending more than
   100 to 3000 km(2), a semidistributed model (GRAM) has been developed,
   which conceptualizes extensively interconnected volumes of workings as
   ponds, which are connected to other ponds only at discrete overflow
   points, such as major inter-mine roadways, through which flow can be
   efficiently modeled using the Prandtl-Nikuradse pipe-flow formulation.
   At the very largest scales, simple water-balance calculations are
   Probably as useful as any other approach, and a variety of proprietary
   codes may be used for the purpose.}},

Abstract = {{The behavior of the herbicides isoproturon (IPU) and chlortoluron (CTU)
   in ground water and shallow unsaturated zone sediments were evaluated at
   a site situated an the Chalk in southern England. Concentrations of IPU
   in ground water samples varied from <0.05 to 0.23 <mu>g/L over a
   five-year period of monitoring, and were found to correlate with
   application of the pesticide. Concentrations of pesticides in ground
   water samples collected during periods of rising water table were
   significantly higher than pumped samples and suggest that rapidly
   infiltrating recharge water contains higher herbicide concentrations
   than the native ground water. Significant variations in herbicide
   concentrations were observed over a three-month period in ground water
   samples collected by an automated system, with concentrations of IPU
   ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 mug/L, and concentrations of a recent
   application of CTU ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 mug/L, Different extraction
   methods were used to assess pore water concentrations of herbicides in
   the unsaturated zone, and samples were analyzed by standard HPLC
   analysis and immunoassay (ELISA) methods. These data indicated highly
   variable concentrations of herbicide ranging from 4 to 200 g/ha for HPLC
   and 0.01 to 0.04 g/ha for ELISA, but indicate a general pattern of
   decreasing concentrations with depth. The results of this study indicate
   that transport of IPU and CTU through the unsaturated zone to shallow
   ground water occurs and that this transport increases immediately
   following herbicide application, Measured concentrations of herbicides
   are generally lower than specified by the European Union Drinking Water
   Directive, but are observed to spike above this limit. These results
   imply that, while delivery of pesticides to ground water can occur as a
   result of normal agricultural practices, the impact on potable supplies
   is likely to be negligible due to the potential far degradation during
   the relatively long travel time through the unsaturated zone and high
   degree of dilution that occurs within the aquifer, As a result of the
   wide variation in concentrations detected by different techniques, it is
   suggested that for future site investigations more than one sampling
   strategy be employed to characterize the occurrence of pesticide
   residues and elucidate the transport mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of biodegradation in contaminated aquifers depends to a large
   extent on dispersive mixing processes that are now generally accepted to
   result from spatial variations in the velocity field. It has been shown,
   however, that transient flow fields can also contribute to dispersive
   mixing. The influence of transient flow on biodegrading contaminants is
   particularly important since it can enhance mixing with electron
   acceptors, further promoting the reactive process. Using numerical
   simulations, the effect of transient flow on the behavior of a
   biodegradable contaminant is evaluated here both with respect to the
   development of apparently large horizontal transverse dispersion and
   also,vith respect to enhanced mixing between the substrate (electron
   donor) and electron acceptor. The numerical model BIO3D, which solves
   for advective-dispersive transport coupled with Monod-type
   biodegradation of substrates in the presence of an electron acceptor,
   was used for the simulations. The model was applied in a two-dimensional
   plan view mode considering a single substrate. Transient flow fields
   were found to yield larger apparent transverse dispersion because the
   longitudinal dispersivity also acts transverse to the mean flow
   direction. In the reactive case, the transient now field increases
   substrate-oxygen mixing, which in turn enhances the overall rate of
   biodegradation. The results suggest that in the case of moderate changes
   of flow directions, a steady-state flow field can be justified, thereby
   avoiding the higher computational costs of a fully transient simulation.
   The use of a higher transverse horizontal dispersivity in a steady flow
   field can, under these conditions, adequately forecast plume
   development.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was carried out to measure drawdowns in observation
   wells and stream depletion flows that occurred when water was abstracted

   measurements with a solution obtained by Hunt (1999), The analysis uses
   early time drawdowns with a match-point method to determine T and S, and
   stream depletion measurements at later times are used to determine
   lambda. The final results are reasonably consistent for measurements
   taken in four observation wells. The advantages and disadvantages of
   this approach are discussed, and two alternative ways of estimating
   lambda, are also discussed.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics of nitrogen loading and aquifer susceptibility to
   contamination were evaluated to determine their influence on
   contamination of shallow ground water by nitrate. A set of 13
   explanatory variables was derived from these characteristics, and
   variables that have a significant influence were identified using
   logistic regression (LR), Multivariate LR models based on more than 900
   sampled wells predicted the probability of exceeding 4 mg/L of nitrate
   in ground water. The final LR model consists of the following variables:
   (1) nitrogen fertilizer loading (p-value = 0.012); (2) percent
   cropland-pasture (p < 0.001); (3) natural log of population density (p <
   0.001); (4) percent well-drained soils (p = 0.002); (5) depth to the
   seasonally high water table (p = 0.001); and (6) presence or absence of
   a fracture zone within an aquifer (p = 0.002). Variables 1-3 were
   compiled within circular, 500m radius areas surrounding sampled wells,
   and variables 4-6 were compiled within larger areas representing
   targeted land use and aquifers of interest. Fitting criteria indicate
   that the full logistic-regression model is highly significant (p <
   0.001), compared with an intercept-only model that contains none of the
   explanatory variables, A goodness-of-fit test indicates that the model
   fits the data well, and observed and predicted probabilities of
   exceeding 4 mg/L nitrate in ground water are strongly correlated (r(2) =
   0.971), Eased on the multivariate LR model, vulnerability of ground
   water to contamination by nitrate depends not on any single factor but
   on the combined, simultaneous influence of factors representing nitrogen
   loading sources and aquifer susceptibility characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Five common numerical techniques for solving the advection-dlispersion
   equation (finite difference, predictor corrector, total variation
   diminishing, method of characteristics, and modified method of
   characteristics) were tested using simulations of a controlled
   conservative tracer-test experiment through a heterogeneous,
   two-dimensional sand tank. The experimental facility was constructed
   using discrete, randomly distributed, homogeneous blocks of five sand
   types. This experimental model provides an opportunity to compare the
   solution techniques: the heterogeneous hydraulic-conductivity
   distribution of known structure can be accurately represented by a
   numerical model, and detailed measurements can be compared with
   simulated concentrations and total flow through the tank. The present
   work uses this opportunity to investigate how three common types of
   results-simulated breakthrough curves, sensitivity analysis, and
   calibrated parameter values-change in this heterogeneous situation given
   the different methods of simulating solute transport. The breakthrough
   curves show that simulated peak concentrations, even at very fine grid
   spacings, varied between the techniques because of different amounts of
   numerical dispersion. Sensitivity-analysis results revealed: (1) a high
   correlation between hydraulic conductivity and porosity given the
   concentration and flow observations used, so that both could not be
   estimated; and (2) that the breakthrough curve data did not provide
   enough information to estimate individual, values of dispersivity for
   the five sands. This study demonstrates that the choice of assigned
   dispersivity and the amount of numerical dispersion present in the
   solution technique influence estimated hydraulic conductivity values to
   a surprising degree.}},

Abstract = {{The Bouwer and Rice method of estimating the saturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K-s) from slug-test data was evaluated for geometries
   typical of hand-dug wells, A two-dimensional, radially symmetric and
   variably saturated, ground water transport model was used to simulate
   well recovery given a range of well and aquifer geometries and
   unsaturated soil properties, the latter in terms of the van Genuchten
   parameters, The standard Bouwer and Rice method, when applied to the
   modeled recharge rates, underestimated K-s by factors ranging from 1.3
   to 5.6, depending on the well geometry and the soil type. The Bouwer and
   Rice analytical solution was modified to better explain the recovery
   rates as predicted by the numerical model, which revealed a significant
   dependence on the unsaturated soil for the shallow and wide geometries
   that are typical of traditional wells. The modification introduces a new
   parameter to the Bouwer and Rice analysis that is a measure of soil
   capillarity which improves the accuracy of K-s estimates by tenfold for
   the geometries tested.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional methods of analyzing pumping test data usually assume a
   single-phase fluid condition. In coastal aquifer systems this condition
   is not valid when salt water underlies the production well screen, A set
   of type curves is developed for unsteady state flow toward a fresh water

   conditions on the interface and for different interface geometry, The
   governing partial differential equations are solved using the
   finite-element approximation for confined, homogeneous, and isotropic
   aquifer situations. The type curves were used to estimate the aquifer
   fresh water hydraulic conductivity and aquifer specific storage using
   pumping test data from a pumping well located on the coast of the Red
   Sea. The measured drawdowns are consistent with the predicted drawdown
   of the type curves.}},

Title = {{Geostatistical inversion of cross-hole pumping tests for identifying
   preferential flow channels within a shear zone}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cross-hole pumping tests within a subvertical shear zone in granite were
   interpreted using a geostatistical inverse approach. The objective was
   to identify flow channels that influence tracer experiments. The spatial
   correlation structure of transmissivity (T) was unknown. Therefore, a
   wide variety of geostatistical hypotheses were made for estimating a
   total of 40 T fields, that honor equally well the pumping tests, the
   static head measurements, and the point T data. All estimated T fields
   reveal channels with similar topology and with a preferred horizontal
   orientation, possibly due to vertical displacements within the
   subvertical shear zone. This shows that inverse geostatistical modeling
   of abundant hydraulic measurements can be useful to reveal a coarse
   heterogeneity structure, even when data are insufficient to identify the
   geostatistical structure. However, numerical simulations of a field
   tracer test were highly sensitive to the geostatistical hypotheses. In
   summary, T fields leading to successful hydraulic data fitting do not
   necessarily lead to successful transport predictions, even when they
   appear to reproduce the coarse heterogeneity structure.}},

   from dams in order to sustain a continual flow of water in the state's

   area, the ``Ilha de Limoeiro{''} (Isle of Limoeiro), is located in the
   Lower Jaguaribe Basin and comprises an area of approximately 120 km(2).
   We used environmental oxygen-18 and deuterium, together with
   hydrochemistry, in order to identify the origin of ground water which is
   heavily exploited for intensive small-scale irrigation in that part of
   the floodplain of the Jaguaribe River. This paper discusses the
   mechanisms of recharge for the different hydrogeologic systems:

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to examine potential relationships
   between land use-derived solutes and baseflow surface water quality
   using regional ground water and solute transport models linked to
   geographic information systems (GIS), We demonstrate this approach by
   estimating chloride concentrations in surface water due to road salt
   transport through ground water in a large coastal watershed in Michigan.
   The geologically parameterized model for this study provides a good fit
   to measured hydraulic heads in the watershed and offers a method to
   estimate spatially and temporally variable solute fluxes via ground
   water to streams and lakes. The results demonstrate that there is a
   considerable legacy of land use influencing surface water quality at the
   study site. The simulated chloride concentrations produced with salted
   roads as the only chloride source are similar to measured surface water
   chloride concentrations throughout most of the watershed, except in
   regions where other sources for chloride (e.g., high-density septic
   systems, locations of oil brine fields) likely exist, Impacts of other
   land use related solutes on baseflow surface water quality could also be
   explored using this approach. As a result, watershed managers could be
   provided with quantitative information about the potential impacts of
   developments and associated surface-applied solutes on future surface
   water quality.}},

Abstract = {{We outline a methodology for quantifying the risk (probability) to
   exceed environmental regulation standards for ground water quality and
   coupling this risk quantification with an analysis of abatement costs
   for attaining an acceptable risk level. The methodology accounts for the
   uncertainty that results from random spatial variability in the
   subsurface, and for sorption-desorption kinetics. Random spatial
   variability implies that, with a deterministic regulating framework, the
   risk (probability) of exceeding given water quality targets may remain
   high even after abatement measures have been taken. We show how this
   risk can be set in focus by use of a probabilistic regulating framework,
   which enables better risk management, Both the environmental risk and
   the associated abatement costs will depend on the actual combination of
   subsurface variability, the ground water sampling method, and sorption
   kinetics, through the underlying quantification of pollutant
   concentration statistics. Our results emphasize the importance of a
   relevant account of the kinetics of the sorption-desorption process, by
   illustrating that neglect, or equilibrium simplification of that
   process, may result in highly misleading risk and abatement cost
   estimates.}},

Abstract = {{Nonpoint source pollution of surface water from overland flow drainage
   tiles, and ground water discharge is a major cause of water quality
   impairment in Iowa, Nonpoint source pollution from base flow ground
   water was estimated in the Walnut Creek watershed by measuring chemical
   loads of atrazine, nitrate, chloride, and sulfate at 18 tributary creeks
   and 19 tiles, Loads were measured during a stable base flow period at
   creeks and tiles that discharged into Walnut Creek between two stream
   gauges. Chemical concentrations of atrazine (< 0.1-12 <mu>g/L), nitrate
   (0.1 to 15 mg/L), and chloride (1.5 to 26 mg/L) in water were similar
   for creek and tile samples, Water draining predominantly agricultural
   row crop areas had much higher concentrations than water draining
   restored prairie areas, Three methods were used to estimate base flow
   discharge in the watershed: (1) Darcy flux; (2) watershed discharge
   budget; and (3) discharge-drainage area; each yielded similar results
   (31.2 L/s to 62.3 L/s). Base flow loads to the main channel were
   estimated by subtracting the loads from the upstream gauge; creeks and
   tiles, from the total load measured at the downstream gauge station,
   Base flow concentration for atrazine ranged from 0.15 to 0.29 mug/L and
   sulfate concentration ranged from 32 to 64 mg/L, whereas concentrations
   for nitrate and chloride were negative (-1 to -4 mg/L), Calculated base
   flow concentrations of atrazine and sulfate appeared to be reasonable
   estimates, but negative concentrations of nitrate and chloride imply
   either loss of chemical mass in the stream from upstream to downstream
   sampling points or measurement error. Load data suggest little
   contribution from base flow pollutants to Walnut Creek water quality,
   with most of the pollutant load derived from major tributary creeks,
   Results from this study have implications for determining total maximum
   daily loads in agricultural watersheds where contributions from point
   sources (creeks and tiles) can be used to estimate loads from nonpoint
   source ground water inputs.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical fertilizer use in Egypt has increased significantly since the
   construction of the Aswan High Dam in 1968, Increased applications of
   chemical fertilizers in irrigated lands are likely to create nonpoint
   contamination sources of chemical fertilizer species. This study was
   conducted to investigate the contamination of ground water by nitrogen
   and phosphorus chemical fertilizers, as well as the availability of
   ground water for irrigation and public water supply for the next
   century. Future concentrations of NO3-, and PO43- in shallow and deep
   ground water in the Nile Valley were assessed under realizable rates of
   fertilizer application. A ground water modeling system (GMS) was used to
   simulate the three-dimensional ground water flow and contaminant
   transport in the Tahta region of the Nile Valley Aquifer, and to predict
   the future concentrations of chemical fertilizer species, Results of the
   transport simulation predict the occurrence of ground water
   contamination at shallow depths (30 m) due to the high rate and method
   of chemical fertilizer applications. Best management practices should be
   employed to control and reduce the nitrate leaching and future impact of
   phosphorus and potassium fertilizer applications. At the same time, new
   deeper wells should be constructed. In addition, the use of hand pumps,
   in zones close to croplands (15 m depth) must be avoided due to
   susceptibility to fertilizer contamination, Ground water from existing
   deep wells can be used as an alternative water supply Furthermore, a
   ground water quality monitoring system should be established for early
   detection of ground water contamination and to determine progress of the
   fertilizer contaminant plume, A properly designed system should monitor
   nitrate and phosphate composition in observation and water supply wells.}},

Abstract = {{Use of open wells to conduct aquifer tests in fractured crystalline rock
   aquifers is potentially problematic, because open Kelts can
   hydraulically connect highly permeable fracture zones at different
   depths within the rock. Because of this effect, it is questionable
   whether estimates of the hydraulic properties of the rock obtained from
   analysis of an open-well aquifer test in fractured crystalline rock are
   representative of the true rock properties. To address this issue, rock
   properties estimated from such a test are compared with rock properties
   estimated from an aquifer test at the same location in which packers
   were installed in wells to restrict vertical fluid movement along the
   wellbores, Results indicate that when the open-hole test is analyzed
   with a numerical model that accurately represents the three-dimensional
   heterogeneity structure in the wellfield, the open-hole test estimates
   of the rock hydraulic properties are similar to the packer-isolated test
   estimates. When the open-well test is analyzed using a model having an
   oversimplified representation of the rock heterogeneity, the estimates
   of rock transmissivity are similar to the transmissivity estimates from
   the packer-isolated test, but the storativity estimates are larger than
   the storativity estimates from the packer-isolated test. These results
   indicate the importance of accurately representing the rock
   heterogeneity structure when analyzing an open-hole aquifer test in
   fractured crystalline rock.}},

Abstract = {{A study was made of the rate of stream depletion produced by cyclic
   pumping of wells located in a semi-infinite phreatic aquifer bounded by
   a partially penetrating stream with semipervious bed. Analytical
   solutions were developed by applying superposition principles to the
   solutions for a continuous pumping well near a stream whose bed is
   semipervious and partially penetrates the aquifer (i.e., Hantush's 1965
   solution), A relationship developed by Spalding and Khaleel (1991) was
   incorporated into the solutions in order to include the effects of the
   effective pumping distance and stream-bed clogging layer, which
   represent the degree of stream penetration and stream-bed resistance,
   respectively. A dimensionless plot based on these equations has been
   developed for the dimensionless volume of stream depletion over a
   pumping cycle. Analysis of this figure showed that effective resistance
   of the semipermeable stream bed is the dominant parameter for the
   determination of equilibrium time. Also a dimensionless plot has been
   developed to determine the magnitudes of error in the maximum rate of
   stream depletion at the time at which a practical state of dynamic
   equilibrium is achieved, when partial penetration of the stream and
   stream-bed clogging layer is neglected. Analysis of this figure also
   showed that neglecting the effects of both the partial penetration of
   the stream and the resistance of the semipermeable layer of the stream
   bed produces a substantial amount of error in the maximum stream
   depletion rates computed by the methods developed by Wallace et al,
   (1990) and Darama (1991).}},

Abstract = {{Electrical and electromagnetic methods are well suited for coastal

   models for these aquifers typically contain four layers: a highly

   intermediate resistivity; an underlying conductive, salt water saturated
   aquifer; and resistive substratum. Additional layers may be added to
   allow for variations in lithology within the fresh water and salt water
   layers. Two methods are evaluated: direct current resistivity and time
   domain electromagnetic soundings. Use of each method alone produces
   nonunique solutions for resistivities and/or thicknesses of the
   different layers. We show that joint inversion of vertical electric and

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{The Great Plains (Dakota) aquifer system is one of the most extensive in
   North America extending from the Arctic Circle to New Mexico, and
   underlies approximately 94\% of Nebraska, In Nebraska, we do not have
   the physical ground water monitoring data at the scale that is necessary
   to manage ground water flow systems. However, first-order management
   strategies for this regional aquifer can be developed by understanding
   the geochemical evolution of the ground water. Using major-ion water
   chemistry data from 203 wells in 19 counties in eastern Nebraska,
   reconnaissance delta O-18, deltaD, and delta Sr-87 data, and two
   geochemical models, PHREEQC and SNORM, we determine that modern meteoric
   water, NaCl brines from underlying formations, and cold glacial melt
   water are the primary sources for the water in the Dakota Aquifer, Based
   on these three water sources and the geochemical evolution of the
   various water types, the following first-order management strategies are
   suggested, In areas where CaSO4 and Ca-Na SO4 type water occur,
   Pleistocene-age glacial meltwater is the source. This water supply is
   not easily renewable. It is recommended that detailed water resource
   evaluation be conducted before extensive development occurs, The source
   of Ca ( +/- Mg) HCO3 type water is from recharge by local precipitation
   and should be managed to maintain them as a renewable resource. In mixed
   ground water type areas, the ground water chemistry reflects the
   interaction of two distinct water types, one of which is meteoric water
   and the other is either CaSO4 and Ca-Na SO4-type water or NaCl-type
   water. If the relatively fresh ground water is extracted at a rate that
   changes the location of the interface between the endmembers, then
   monitoring changes in water chemistry in a well over time could be used
   as an early warning system for the onset of potential problems related
   to overpumping.}},

Abstract = {{Water collected at the Yport (eastern Normandy, France) Drinking Water
   Supply well, situated on a karst cavity, is affected by surface
   runoff-related turbidity spikes that occur mainly in winter, In order to
   forecast turbidity, precipitation was measured at the center of the
   catchment basin over two years, while water level and turbidity were
   monitored at the web site.
   Application of the approach of Box and Jenkins (1976) leads to a linear
   model that can accurately predict major floods about eight hours in
   advance, providing an estimate of turbidity variation on the basis of
   precipitation and mater level variation over the previous 24 hours.
   However, this model is intrinsically unable to deal with (1)
   nonstationary changes in the time process caused by seasonal variations
   of in ground surface characteristics or tidal influence within the
   downstream past of the aquifer, and (2) nonlinear phenomena such as the
   threshold for the onset of runoff. This results in many false-positive
   signals of turbidity in summer.
   Here we present an alternative composite model combining a conceptual
   runoff submodel with a feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), This
   composite model allows us to deal with meaningful variables, the
   actioneffect of which on turbidity is complex, nonlinear, temporally
   variable and often poorly described. Predictions are markedly improved,
   i.e,, the variance of the target variable explained by 12-hour forward
   predictions increases from 28\% to 74\% and summer inaccuracies are
   considerably lowered. The ANN can adjust itself to new hydrological
   conditions, provided that on-line learning is maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) such as perchloroethylene,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, creosote mixtures, and many solvents and
   degreasers can be released into karst aquifers through sinkholes and
   sinking streams in quantities up to tanker car volumes, Although DNAPLs
   are easily injected into karst aquifers, discharge of the contaminants
   through springs may be significantly delayed depending on transport
   mechanism, storm water recharge, and storage sites within the karst
   aquifer, Storage sites include (1) the epikarst; (2) pools and
   depressions within underground streams; (3) incorporation of DNAPL
   within elastic sediments that are present in most conduits; (4)
   adsorption onto organic materials and onto manganese oxides, iron
   oxides, and other substrates; and (5) migration to depth within the
   fracture system. Effective transport of DNAPL contaminants during storm
   now pulses requires the exceedance of thresholds best defined in terms
   of the conduit stream power, Movement of pooled DNAPL requires a
   boundary shear between the liquid and water flowing over it. DNAPL
   stored in clastic sediment bleeds out slowly or dissolves into
   surrounding pore water until storm pulses create a stream now sufficient
   to flush the pore water, or possibly move the sediment pile itself,
   Under extreme flow conditions the entire sediment pile, including the
   DNAPL, can be entrained and ejected from the conduit system.}},

Abstract = {{Subsidence data historically have been collected using costly
   extensometers. Recent advances in InSAR and GPS technology may provide
   noninvasive methods for collecting these data, which can be used in
   conjunction with hydrograph information to estimate the skeletal
   specific storage and hydraulic conductivity values of compressible
   units. Numerical analysis is used to evaluate the conditions affecting
   nonrecoverable (inelastic) and recoverable (elastic) skeletal specific
   storage and to investigate the affects of horizontal strain on the
   extensometer record. Stress-strain diagrams represented as
   subsidence-drawdown plots are one-dimensional in scope, yet are
   typically used for estimating specific storage. Simulation results
   indicate that nonrecoverable specific can be estimated from these
   diagrams even when the storage contribution from horizontal strain is
   significant, Hysteresis effects are common during recovery and
   recompression of cyclically pumped confined aquifers. Several factors
   were found to affect the shape of the hysteresis loops; these include
   (a) the hydraulic diffusivity of the confining unit, (b) the distance
   from the pumped well, (c) length of the recovery cycle, (d) the ratio of
   confined aquifer to confining unit hydraulic conductivities, and (e) the
   thickness of the confining unit. Stress-strain analyses can supplement
   classical time-drawdown data to yield valuable parameter estimation of
   the confining unit that would be otherwise difficult to quantify.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional variable density flow and transport model has been
   developed to study salt water intrusion in the Jahe River Basin,
   Shandong Province, China. A coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian method is
   applied to solve the transport equation, in which the advection part is
   calculated by a hybrid method of characteristics. In using the
   density-dependent tidal effect model, the seaward boundary in the
   confined aquifer is determined according to tidal-effect information,
   The aquifer parameters in the Jahe River Basin are estimated by
   converging long-term observational data of the hydraulic head and
   chloride concentration. Through numerical analysis and prediction, it
   can be concluded that the main reasons for salt water intrusion are
   excessive ground water exploitation and an improper arrangement of
   pumping wells in the lower reaches of the Jahe River Basin as well as
   the tidal-affected river, After predicting the effect of several
   remedial schemes, two measures are suggested to prevent salt water
   intrusion.}},

Abstract = {{Large-diameter wells are used extensively in developing countries,
   especially in unconsolidated alluvial deposits or fissured rocks of
   shallow depths. Principally, they have large storage volume ready for
   exploitation by direct pumping. A simple calculation procedure for
   drawdown in a large-diameter well has been proposed. This is a new
   method that involves the use of the independent variable transform. The
   governing equation can be used easily for the evaluation of drawdowns in
   both pumping and observation wells. Type curves obtained by the
   procedure developed in this paper are compared with those already
   available in ground water literature. The accordance of the derived type
   curves in this study with that bf Papadopulos and Cooper (1967) is
   obvious. However, in this paper, a simple transient solution is
   presented that allows one to find the drawdown at the pumping and
   observation wells in an extensive confined aquifer.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic gradient comparison method is an inverse method for
   estimation of aquifer hydraulic conductivity (or transmissivity) and
   boundary conductance for a ground water flow model under steady-state
   conditions. This method, following formal optimization techniques,
   defines its objective function to minimize differences between
   interpreted (observed) and simulated hydraulic gradients, which results
   in minimization of differences between observed and simulated hydraulic
   heads. The key features of this method are that (1) the derived
   optimality conditions have an explicit form with a clear hydrology
   concept that is consistent with Darcy's law, and (2) the derived
   optimality conditions are spatially independent as they are a function
   of only local hydraulic conductivity and local hydraulic gradient. This
   second feature allows a multidimensional optimization problem to be
   solved by many one-dimensional optimization procedures simultaneously,
   which results in a substantial reduction in computation time. The
   results of the numerical performance testing on a heterogeneous
   hypothetical case confirm that minimizing gradient residuals in the
   entire model domain leads to minimizing head residuals. Application of
   the method in real-world projects requires rigorous conceptual model
   development, use of a global calibration target, and an iterative
   calibration process. The conceptual model development includes
   interpretation of a potentiometric surface and estimation of other
   hydrologic parameters. This method has been applied to a wide range of
   real-world modeling projects, including the Rocky Mountain Arsenal and
   Rocky Flats sites in Colorado, which demonstrates that the method is
   efficient and practical.}},

Abstract = {{Three criteria for the experimental design of parameter estimation are
   compared by using the criteria to develop sampling patterns for
   determining parameter values in one-dimensional transport models. The
   models include advection, dispersion, and matrix diffusion, the latter
   being an important process for nuclear waste isolation. The
   effectiveness of various designs is assessed by studying expected errors
   of parameter estimates and correlation between parameters. The
   correlations and expected errors are computed using parameter
   sensitivities, and the results demonstrate that the choice of design
   criterion can make a significant difference in the expected estimation
   error of parameter values in sparse designs. The best overall choice is
   D-optimality, which is a measure of the volume of the joint confidence
   ellipsoid of the parameter estimates. E-optimality, which minimizes the
   longest axis of the confidence ellipsoid, gives somewhat similar results
   but is not as robust for all of the estimated parameters. It is also
   shown that approaches that consider parameter sensitivities, but not
   correlation between parameters, may result in inferior designs.}},

Abstract = {{A method of computing the vertical distributions of solute
   concentrations in aquifer strata penetrated by an existing well or
   borehole can be developed from a simple solute mass/water balance
   approach. This approach allows refinement of site characterization
   without the cost of drilling additional wells or using other site
   characterization methods. This method also allows prediction of the
   water quality impacts of different well construction and screening
   options when the vertical distribution of flows from an aquifer and the
   aquifer water concentrations are known or can be estimated. Data
   requirements and methods of data collection for use of the technique are
   reviewed. Flowmeter or spinner logging surveys indicate the flow
   contribution of each portion of the well. When depth-specific samples
   are collected under the same Dumping conditions as the spinner logging,
   a solute mass/water balance approach allows vertical concentration
   distributions in the aquifer to be estimated. Application to a well
   containing arsenic concentrations that approach the maximum contaminant
   level (MCL) of 50 mug/L indicates that water with arsenic concentrations
   of nearly 100 mug/L enters the well from a particular stratum.}},

   A homogeneous but not necessarily isotropic aquifer is assumed.
   Depending on the time since the start of discharge, the equations are
   basically the same in form as for flow to either a fully penetrating
   channel or to a vertical well, but they contain an additional term
   accounting for vertical flow. A modification is introduced to make the

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Abstract = {{Standard measurements of solute sorption to sediments are typically made
   on the <2 mm sediment fraction. This fraction is used by researchers to
   standardize the method and to ease experimental protocol so that large
   labware is not required to accommodate the gravel fraction (>2 mm
   particles). Since sorption is a phenomenon directly related to surface
   area, sorption measurements based on the <2 mm fraction would be
   expected to overestimate actual whole-sediment values for sediments
   containing gravel. This inaccuracy is a problem for ground water
   contaminant transport modelers who use laboratory-derived sorption
   values, typically expressed as a distribution coefficients (Kd), to
   calculate the retardation factor (Rf), a parameter that accounts for
   solute-sediment chemical interactions. The objectives of this laboratory
   study were to quantify the effect of gravel on strontium Kd and Rf
   values and to develop an empirical method to calculate gravel-corrected
   Kd values for the study site (Hanford Site in Richland, Washington).
   Three gravel corrections, Kd(gc) values, were evaluated: a correction
   based on the assumption that the gravel simply diluted the Kd(< 2mm) and
   had no sorption capacity (Kd(gc),(g=0)), a correction based on the
   assumption that the Kd of the intact sediment (Kd(tot)) was a composite
   of the Kd(< 2mm) and the Kd(> 2mm) (Kd(gc,g=x)), and a correction based
   on surface area (Kd(gc,surf)). On average, Kd(< 2mm) tended to
   overestimate Kd(tot) by 28\% to 47\%; Kd(gc,g=x) overestimated Kd(tot)
   by only 3\% to 5\%; and Kd(gc,g=0) and Kd(gc,surf) underestimated
   Kd(tot) by 10\% to 39\%. Kd(gc,g=x) provided the best estimate of actual
   values (Kd(tot)); however, Kd(gc,g=0) was appreciably easier to acquire.
   Although other contaminants will likely have different gravel-correction
   values, these results have important implications regarding the
   traditional approach to modeling contaminant transport which uses Kd(<
   2mm) values. Such calculations may overestimate the tendency of
   gravel-containing sediments to retard contaminant migration.}},

Abstract = {{During the first cycle of the National Water Quality Assessment
   (1992-1996), ground water in 20 of the nation's major hydrologic basins
   was analyzed for 90 pesticide compounds (pesticides and degradates). One
   or more of the pesticide compounds examined were detected at 48.4\% of
   the 2485 ground water sites sampled. However, approximately 70\% of the
   sites where pesticides were detected, two or more pesticide compounds
   analyzed were present-documenting the prevalence of pesticide mixtures
   in ground water. The pesticide concentrations encountered were generally
   low, with the median total concentration (summation of concentrations
   for the 90 pesticide compounds) being 0.046 mug/L. Pesticides were
   commonly detected in shallow ground water beneath both agricultural
   (60.4\%) and urban (48.5\%) areas. This is an important finding because,
   although agricultural activities have long been associated with
   pesticide contamination, urban areas have only recently been recognized
   as a potential source of these types of compounds. Pesticides with
   higher frequencies of detection were generally those with more extensive
   use greater environmental persistence, and greater mobility in ground
   water (lower soil-water partition coefficients).}},

Abstract = {{Unstable unsaturated zone flow (fingering) is a potentially important
   process in recharge, pollution, and surface water/ground water body
   interactions. Extending previous workers ` studies on homogeneous
   systems, sand tank experiments have been carried out on heterogeneous
   systems. The experiments on initially dry silica sands suggest that (1)
   stratification will tend to enhance rather than dissipate fingering; (2)
   in discontinuously layered systems, funneling influences the location of
   fingers; (3) in multilayered systems, lateral flow on top of
   fine-grained layers promotes greater flux (and more fingers) in the
   down-dip direction; (4) in systems where a top fine-grained layer has a
   variable thickness, finger frequency and, hence, amount of flow will be
   greatest where the fine-grained layer is thinnest; (5) surface
   depressions in an upper fine-grained layer will concentrate pow with
   fingers forming below such areas; and (6) in systems where an upper
   fine-grained layer has macropores, the latter will concentrate water
   flow and fingers will form directly below these zones. The experiments
   also confirmed that fingers can persist in the same locations from one
   recharge event to another, and that in initially moist sands, fingers
   are widened. It is clear that a complex interplay between fingering and
   funneling processes can occur and that finger behavior is sensitive to
   heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic surveys of a young, wholly sedimentary, strip barrier
   island (St. George island) on Florida's Gulf Coast reveal a
   Dupuit-Ghyben-Herzberg fresh water lens with the thickest part located
   close to the ocean side of the island at both undeveloped and developed
   sites. This result is at odds with those obtained on other barrier
   beaches, where the lens is either approximately symmetric or skewed
   toward the lagoon side due to higher sea level and greater upper beach
   storage on the ocean side. The inferred morphology of the fresh water
   lens on St. George Island can be attributed to variations in
   hydrogeologic (e.g., hydraulic conductivity, presence of semipermeable
   confining layer) and/or boundary conditions (e.g., recharge, higher sea
   level on the lagoon side), but the effects of variations in these
   factors on the shape of the lens are not separable. We therefore use
   independent constraints on hydraulic conductivity (from tidal pumping
   analyses), hydrofacies distribution, and recharge patterns to assess the
   plausibility that lateral variations in various physical parameters
   produce the observed lens shape. Dune ridge topography, which may
   constitute a significant portion of the width of a narrow island,
   perturbs recharge and shallow ground water flow patterns and may
   contribute to the development of a thick fresh water lens on an island's
   ocean side. However, topographic variations alone cannot account for the
   anomalous form of the island's fresh water lens.}},

Abstract = {{Field tests were conducted to investigate skin effects in multilevel
   ground water samplers installed with direct push methods. Tests
   consisted of determining hydraulic conductivity values using slug tests
   in five multilevel samplers before, during, and after development.
   Development was conducted using a minisurge block tool designed for this
   study. Post-development hydraulic conductivity values were found to be
   3.2 to 9.6 times greater than predevelopment values. The largest
   differences were observed in multilevel samplers positioned in low
   permeable materials that were installed in preprobed holes advanced by
   hydraulic hammering and pushing as opposed to probes situated in higher
   permeable materials that were installed in cored holes. The presence and
   magnitude of the skin effects, as well as the reduction of these effects
   by rigorous development, were confirmed through comparisons with
   steady-state pumping tests conducted in multilevel samplers and
   previously conducted slug tests in conventional monitoring wells. These
   results indicate the need for rigorous development prior to hydraulic
   conductivity testing in ground water samplers installed with direct push

Abstract = {{Techniques to obtain optimal value from existing hydrogeological
   information are neglected in many ground water contamination studies,
   resulting in great costs to the public. Data collection and routine
   interpretations should not be good enough for hydrogeologists, who
   should be inherently adept at keen early perspectives and applying
   useful generalizations. Techniques are available to obtain and explain
   expanded knowledge from piecemeal and imprecise information at the early
   stages of site studies. Scarcity of precise data should not be a
   deterrent. This needed mindset should precede the prevailing mindset of
   initial collection of extensive new data, followed by data
   interpretation and mathematical modeling. The existing mindset is often
   guided by rigid regulations.
   The procedure of interlocking the past with the present to predict the
   future through the systematic use of generalizations and retrodictive
   inferences builds a prior conceptual model explanation (PCME). This
   early PCME is an organized, mental picture or discernment of a
   hydrogeological setting displaying three-dimensional hydrogeologic
   features, the discernment being capable of explaining in narrative form
   the general fluid mechanics and contaminant behavior within imprecise
   but reasonable bounds. This characterization is logically followed by
   possible cause-and-effect relations and predictions of extended
   consequences of natural and human actions. A site PCME has sound support
   from the cross-checking of interrelated factors that leads to almost
   interlocking proofs.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel, explicit closed form solution using the Lambert W
   function to a steady-state one-dimensional contaminant transport
   equation incorporating the Monod expression for biodegradation. This new
   solution overcomes some of the limitations associated with using the
   existing implicit solution and provides a simple method of describing
   biodegradation at contaminated sites using the Monod equation. The
   field-scale applicability of this approach was tested using data on
   phenol and toluene biodegradation from previously published studies. A
   review of published Monod kinetic parameters for hydrocarbon
   biodegradation indicated that in most cases, the half saturation
   coefficient was lower than 5 mg/L, suggesting that the commonly used
   first-order approximation is valid only at low substrate concentrations.
   While the Monod equation does not have this limitation and can usually
   provide an accurate description of biodegradation at contaminated sites,
   its nonlinear nature presents computational and parameter estimation
   difficulties compared with the linear and relatively simple first- and
   zero-order approximations. The explicit closed form solution to the
   Monod equation presented in this study greatly simplifies its use and
   appears to be an attractive approach to describe contaminant
   biodegradation in the field.}},

Abstract = {{More than 270 multirate single-hole pneumatic injection tests were
   conducted by Guzman et al. (1996) within six shallow vertical and
   inclined boreholes in unsaturated fractured tuff at the Apache Leap
   Research Site (ALRS) near Superior, Arizona. The authors used
   steady-state formulae to obtain air permeability values for the rock
   based solely on late pressure data from each test. We developed pressure
   and pressure-derivative type-curves for the interpretation of transient
   data from these tests, which account for storage in the test interval
   due to air compressibility and skin effect due to damage to the
   surrounding rock. We applied our type-curves to pressure data from more
   than 40 of the tests to obtain information about air permeability, skin
   factor, phenomenology, and dimensionality of the flow regime on a
   nominal scale of 1 m in the immediate vicinity of each test interval.
   Our air permeabilities agreed well with those determined previously by
   means of steady- state formulae but correlated poorly with fracture
   density data. Nonlinear effects due to air compressibility were
   pronounced, but skin effect was generally small or nonexistent.
   Nonlinear two-phase flow and inertia were evident but did not have a
   significant impact on type-curve interpretation of the test data. Most
   of these data fit a continuum model of spherical airflow around the test
   interval, but a few fit a continuum model of radial flow or suggest the
   dominance of a single fracture. We take this to imply that fractures at
   the site are pneumatically well connected and can, for the most part, be
   treated as a porous continuum when analyzing airflow on scales of 1 m or
   more. This is supported by the finding that 1 m scale air permeability
   data from single-hole tests at the ALRS are amenable to geostatistical
   analysis (Chen et al. 2000), which views them as a sample from a random
   field defined over a continuum. That the same holds true on larger scale
   is indicated by our ability to interpret cross-hole pneumatic injection
   tests at the site by means of type-curves and inverse methods (Illman et
   al. 1998), which treat the entire rock mass as a porous continuum.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of ground water from wells and springs in the United States
   indicate a broad regional trend in preanthropogenic ((CI)-C-36/total CI)
   x 10(15) ratios in potable water. Coastal areas influenced by marine
   chloride have ratios less than 100. These ratios increase inland and
   reach a maximum of about 1400 in the central and northern Rocky
   Mountains. However, the magnitude of these regional variations is
   greatly exceeded at a local level if water samples are considered
   regardless of age or origin. Most local departures from regional trends
   can be attributed to mixing of ground water recharge with either
   (CI)-C-36 from nuclear fusion tests to produce higher ratios or mixing
   with sources of old chloride such as from evaporite minerals to produce
   lower ratios. A useful interpretation of (CI)-C-36 data is difficult
   unless the origin of the chloride is understood. The interpretation is
   an unusually difficult problem for water having low chloride
   concentrations. The assumption that low concentrations originate
   primarily from wet and dry atmospheric deposition can be questioned even
   for some dilute waters with less than 2.0 mg/L chloride.
   Chloride/bromide ratios in ground water can help decipher the origin of
   the chloride. The presence of nonatmospheric chloride can be identified
   in part by its association with chloride/bromide mass ratios greater
   than about 200 in coastal areas and 100 in inland areas. Accurate
   chloride and bromide analyses are recommended for virtually all studies
   of (CI)-C-36 in natural waters, and particularly those with low
   concentrations of chloride.}},

Abstract = {{Two detailed vertical profiles through a complex plume of phenolic
   contaminants in a Triassic sandstone aquifer show that natural
   attenuation by biodegradation and dispersion is active but very slow.
   The plume has a microbially active aerobic and NO3 reducing fringe that
   is less than 2 m thick at both 150 and 350 m downstream of the source.
   The anaerobic core has evidence of active bacterial populations and
   degradation at total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations up to at least
   1400 mg/L (1800 mg/L total phenolics), although gross half-lives are
   more than 50 years. There is evidence from the same locations of Mn, Fe,
   and SO, reduction, with the latter inhibited by the pollutant matrix and
   not significant at concentrations more than 1000 mg/L TOC. Degradation
   of these contaminants in this aquifer is influenced by a range of
   environmental factors, including the chemical toxicity and pH of the
   contaminant matrix, and inputs of electron accepters into the plume by
   dispersion. The results show that the plume is likely to grow under the
   present conditions, despite the biodegradable nature of the organic
   pollutants and availability of suitable electron accepters. Vertical
   profiles have proved a cost-effective method of understanding the
   evolution of the plume.}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of common-offset ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to
   detect free-phase hydrocarbons in bedrock fractures was evaluated using
   numerical modeling and physical experiments. The results of one- and
   two-dimensional numerical modeling at 100 megahertz indicate that GPR
   reflection amplitudes are relatively insensitive to fracture apertures
   ranging from 1 to 4 mm. The numerical modeling and physical experiments
   indicate that differences in the fluids that fill fractures
   significantly affect the amplitude and the polarity of electromagnetic
   waves reflected by subhorizontal fractures. Air-filled and
   hydrocarbon-filled fractures generate low-amplitude reflections that are
   in-phase with the transmitted pulse. Water-filled fractures create
   reflections with greater amplitude and opposite polarity than those
   reflections created by air-filled or hydrocarbon-filled fractures.
   The results from the numerical modeling and physical experiments
   demonstrate it is possible to distinguish water-filled fracture
   reflections from air- or hydrocarbon-filled fracture reflections,
   nevertheless subsurface heterogeneity, antenna coupling changes, and
   other sources of noise will likely make it difficult to observe these
   changes in GPR field data. This indicates that the routine application
   of common-offset GPR reflection methods for detection of
   hydrocarbon-filled fractures will be problematic. Ideal cases will
   require appropriately processed, high-quality GPR data, ground-truth
   information, and detailed knowledge of subsurface physical properties.
   Conversely, the sensitivity of GPR methods to changes in subsurface
   physical properties as demonstrated by the numerical and experimental
   results suggests the potential of using GPR methods as a monitoring
   tool. GPR methods may be suited for monitoring pumping and tracer tests,
   changes in site hydrologic conditions, and remediation activities.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water flow modeling in a karst aquifer presents many
   difficulties. In particular, the hydrodynamic properties and the now
   behavior can vary over time. History matching of transient-state
   conditions is required to test the accuracy of the model under varying
   hydrodynamic conditions. The objective of this study was to illustrate
   how transient-state conditions can be used to history match a ground
   water flow model of a large aquifer, the La Rochefoucauld karst
   (Charente, France). The model used a porous medium equivalent and was
   based on a steady-state calibration of hydraulic conductivities. The
   history match consisted of studying the simulated heads and spring flow
   rates to test the capacity of the model to reproduce different aspects
   of the aquifer behavior, The simulated heads and flow rates were
   analyzed as new data using correlation and spectral analyses to compare
   the temporal structures of the measured and simulated time series. The
   analyses provided information on the storage capacity of the aquifer,
   the input-output delays, the degree of correlation between input and
   output, and the length of the impulse response of the aquifer, These
   data were used to study the impact of the hypotheses underlying the
   model (hydraulic conductivities, storage coefficient, representation of
   rivers, use of a porous medium equivalent). The results show that the
   model adequately simulates the overall behavior of the studied aquifer,
   The model can be used under variable hydrodynamic conditions to simulate
   ground water flow on a regional scale. This case study illustrates how a
   complete history match of a simplified representation of reality can
   lead to an adequate mathematical tool.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing decline of water levels in the confined basalt aquifers of the
   Pullman-Moscow Basin of Washington and Idaho has prompted study of the
   timing, amount and distribution of recharge to the system. Previous
   radiocarbon ages indicate residence times on the order of 10(3) years
   and greater and suggest a low rate of recharge to the lower basalt
   aquifer since the end of Pleistocene time. By contrast, more recent
   hydrodynamic flow modeling studies invoke a larger Holocene recharge
   rate through the unconfined loess unit to the upper and lower basalt
   aquifers, which implies relatively short residence times (10(2) years).
   Stable isotopes were used to independently assess contrasting recharge
   models by comparing O-18/O-16 and D/H ratios of late-Holocene shallow
   ground water and deep ground water. Linear regression of local
   precipitation ratios yields deltaD = 6.9 delta O-18 - 18.4. There is no
   evidence of fractionation of ground water ratios by recharge processes
   or water-rock interactions. Deep basalt ground water delta O-18 values
   are depleted by 0.4 to 4.9 per mil relative to shallow, recently
   recharged ground waters and have delta O-18 values statistically
   distinct from waters sampled from other stratigraphic units. These
   findings suggest that the deep waters in the basin were not precipitated
   under current climate conditions and that aquifer recharge rates to the
   deep basalt aquifer are substantially lower than have been recently
   estimated. This in turn suggests that a sustainable ground water

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{651-656}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Sorption of two fluorescent dyes (fluorescein and sulforhodamine B) was
   evaluated with two oppositely charged, consolidated aquifer materials
   (sandstone and limestone). Fluorescein, which has an anionic carboxylic
   group, experienced negligible sorption onto negatively charged sandstone
   and sorbed much less than sulforhodamine B, with its two sulfonic
   groups, onto positively charged Limestone. The cationic charge on
   sulforhodamine B caused it to adsorb onto negatively charged sandstone.
   These results validate and extend previous research with pure mineral
   surfaces (alumina and silica), Sorption kinetic rates decreased with
   increasing particle size which is consistent with diffusion-limited
   intraparticle sorption, Tortuosity factors were determined by fitting a
   diffusion-limited intraparticle sorption model to kinetic data for one
   particle size (all other parameters being determined independently).
   This tortuosity factor, which was consistent with Archie's law-based
   estimates and other independently determined parameters, was
   subsequently used to predict kinetic adsorption results for a second
   particle size. Close agreement between experimental data and model
   predictions corroborated intraparticle diffusion-limited sorption as an
   important process. Diffusion-limited sorption can impact dye transport
   in unconsolidated grains having internal porosity or consolidated or
   fractured media having dual porosity, These results thus demonstrate the
   importance of understanding both the equilibrium and kinetics of dye
   sorption when designing and interpreting tracer studies.}},

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{657-664}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Subsurface properties such as moisture content, hydraulic head, or
   chemical composition may vary markedly over short vertical distances in
   soil and ground water systems, but conventional samplers and sensors
   placed in vertical boreholes are often unable to resolve these
   variations, To improve the resolution of subsurface monitoring, me have
   developed a method for accessing the side-wall of a vertical or angled
   borehole at many discrete intervals along the entire length of the
   borehole, The method uses an access device that embeds sensors or
   sediment samplers laterally through the borehole sidewall into the
   undisturbed formation to distances slightly less than the diameter of
   the borehole, The access device can also obtain a core sample up to 15
   cm long and 4 cm in diameter, and then insert a permeable sleeve for
   extracting fluid samples (water, gas, nonaqueous phase liquids). The
   system has been used under field conditions in the United States and
   Denmark to place electrodes capable of measuring water content (using
   time domain reflectometry {[}TDR] waveguides), Eh (using platinum
   electrodes), or electrical resistivity (using a four-conductor
   electrode). At one site, as many as 22 water samplers and 19 resistivity
   electrodes were installed in a single borehole at vertical spacings as
   close as 7 cm, This approach was used to install horizontally oriented
   TDR waveguides at depths greater than 10 m, thereby extending the TDR
   technique to the study of deep vadose zones. Other applications include
   measurement of in situ Eh at a site where strong chemical oxidants were
   injected to remediate sediments contaminated by organic chemicals.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{665-672}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulation is used to examine the utility of simple
   (homogeneous/isotropic) models for the delineation of wellhead
   protection areas (WHPAs) in heterogeneous, statistically anisotropic,
   unconfined aquifers, Capture zone geometry is investigated under two
   hydrologic conditions: regional gradient negligible compared to pumping
   and significant regional gradient compared to the local gradient due to
   pumping. Variability of capture zone geometry is quantified in terms of
   simple measurements (maximum transport distance and maximum width of the
   capture zone) and the probability of inclusion in the capture zone of a
   series of hypothetical contaminant soul ce locations. These results
   indicate that substantial uncertainty exists in the delineation of a
   wellhead capture zone. This uncertainty is related, principally, to flow
   that occurs along preferential pathways associated with zones of high
   hydraulic conductivity. It is suggested that these uncertainties can be
   accommodated in one of three fashions depending on the value of land,
   the benefit of wellhead protection, and the availability of funds to
   perform more thorough field assessment, The first option is to modify
   the estimated capture zone by a factor of safety. In the absence of
   significant regional flow, a factor of safety of approximately three
   applied to the calculated fixed radius estimate of the capture zone
   appears to be sufficient for the conditions simulated in this project,
   In the case of a capture zone within a significant regional gradient,
   uncertainty in the location of the real capture zone will require safety
   factors on the width of the estimated capture zone on the order of 30,
   with a safety factor of approximately three in the longitudinal
   direction. The second option reduces these factors of safety by
   increasing the risk that the estimated capture zone will not cover the
   entire area of the real capture zone. work available in the literature
   prow-ides insight into the trade-off between the size of the estimated
   capture zone and the risk endured. The third option is to reduce
   uncertainty in the vicinity of a wellhead through additional expenditure
   to allow the application of classic hydrologic techniques involving
   conditioning or inverse modeling.}},

Abstract = {{An assessment of a conventional soil vacuum extraction (SVE) system to
   remove perchloroethylene (PCE), a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL),
   was conducted in a dewatered 9 X 9 m block of the surficial sand aquifer
   located at the Canadian Forces Base (CFB), Borden, Ontario.
   Approximately two years prior to the installation and operation of the
   SVE system, 1250 kg of PCE were released under saturated conditions into
   this experimental cell, forming a heterogeneous DNAPL distribution.
   Using ground penetrating radar and neutron probe data in conjunction
   with detailed soil core data, it was determined that approximately 600
   kg of PCE were available for removal by the SVE system after dewatering.
   Performance assessment of this SVE system was based on soil core data
   and monitoring of in situ gas concentration and pressure, soil
   temperature, and moisture content.
   After the first 25 days of operation, the SVE system had removed 230 kg
   of PCE, during which time the off-gas concentration decreased by 70\%
   from an initial concentration of close to 3500 ppm, After 432 days of
   operation, 63\% (376 kg) of the estimated available mass was removed
   from the SVE target zone. In situ pressure measurements and sulphur
   hexafluoride tracer tests indicated that advective air movement occurred
   throughout the SVE target zone. Changes to the extraction well
   configuration and the use of short-screened extraction drive points did
   not increase the mass removal performance.
   After 250 days of operation, eight soil cores were removed from the test
   cell, and bulk soil concentration and soil moisture content
   measurements,were performed at 0.05 m increments along the length of
   each core. These data revealed zones where significant quantities of PCE
   remained, even though the cumulative mass removal profile for the SVE
   system was nonzero asymptotic. In general, these zones coincided with
   higher moisture content zones reflective of the heterogeneous nature of
   this porous medium.
   This investigation provides insight into some of the limitations of
   conventional SVE technology to clean up a sand aquifer contaminated with
   a DNAPL, given a reasonably good estimate of the before-extraction mass
   conditions. In particular, the findings clearly show that the
   heterogeneous nature of the porous medium gives rise to a nonuniform
   moisture content, a heterogeneous pure phase distribution, and the
   development of preferential gas phase flow pathways, As a consequence,
   this will in general limit this technology to remove a considerable
   fraction of the DNAPL mass present. The results also shed light on the
   use of soil gas and bulk soil concentration data to provide a
   representative picture of the in situ mass distribution. And finally, an
   analysis of the system off-gas data showed that continuous rather than
   pulsed operation of the extraction system increased mass removal.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate is now recognized as a widespread ground water contaminant,
   which has led to increased efforts to control and mitigate its impacts.
   This study reports on the long-term performance of four pilot-scale
   field trials in which reactive porous barriers were used to provide
   passive in situ treatment of nitrate in ground water. At two of the
   sites (Killarney and Borden), the reactive barriers were installed as
   horizontal layers underneath septic system infiltration beds; at a third
   site (Long Point), a barrier was installed as a vertical mall
   intercepting a horizontally migrating septic system plume; and at the
   fourth site (North Campus), a barrier was installed as a containerized
   subsurface reactor treating farm field drainage water. The reactive
   media consisted of 15\% to 100\% by volume of waste cellulose solids
   (wood mulch, sawdust, leaf compost), which provided a carbon source for
   heterotrophic denitrification, The field trials have been in
   semicontinuous operation for six to seven Sears at hydraulic loading
   rates ranging from sis to 2000 L/day, Trials have been successful in
   attenuating influent NO3- (or NO3- + NH4+ at Borden) concentrations
   averaging from 4.8 mg/L N at North Campus to 57 mg/L N at Killarney; by
   amounts averaging 80\% at Killarney: 74\% at Borden? 91\% at Long Point,
   and 58 \% at North Campus. Nitrate consumption rates mere temperature
   dependent and ranged from 0.7 to 32 mg L N/day, but did not deteriorate
   over the monitoring period. Furthermore, mass-balance calculations
   indicate that carbon consumption by heterotrophic denitrification has so
   far used only about 2\% to 3\% of the initial carbon mass in each case.
   Results suggest that such barriers should be capable of providing NO3-
   treatment for at least a decade or longer without carbon replenishment.
   Reactive barriers have now been used to treat nitrate contamination from
   a variety of sources including septic systems, agricultural runoff,
   landfill leachate, and industrial operations. This demonstration of
   successful long-term operation should allow this technology to become
   more widely considered for nitrate remediation, particularly at sites
   where passive treatment requiring a minimum of maintenance is desired.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe governing equations for fluid recovery
   processes in a monitoring well. The proposed formulation is based on
   volumetric equilibrium and multiphase Darcy flow assumptions and may be
   used in the analysis of hail-down tests. Through the numerical solution
   of the mathematical model, we demonstrate that the measurements made at
   the inflection point of the recovery curve, at which the mater/LNAPL
   interface in the monitoring well changes from a rising level to a
   falling level, may depend on several parameters. Thus, present methods
   that use only the LNAPL thickness in the monitoring well at the
   inflection point to estimate the LNAPL thickness in the aquifer may not
   yield adequate estimates. Based on our analysis, we propose a new
   approach to estimate the LNAPL thickness in the aquifer, which relies on
   information on the LNAPL recovery rate in a monitoring well. In addition
   to the measurement of the rate of fluid recovery in a monitoring well,
   the proposed approach also requires information on monitoring well
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations mere used to ex-amine the effects of heterogeneity
   in hydraulic conductivity (K) and intrinsic biodegradation rate on the
   accuracy of contaminant plume-scale biodegradation rates obtained from
   field data. The simulations were based on a steady-state BTEX
   contaminant plume undergoing biodegradation under sulfate-reducing
   conditions, with the electron acceptor in excess. Biomass was either
   uniform or correlated with K to model spatially variable intrinsic
   biodegradation rates. A hydraulic conductivity data set from an alluvial
   aquifer was used to generate three sets of 10 realizations with
   different degrees of heterogeneity and contaminant transport with
   biodegradation was simulated with BIOMOC. Biodegradation rates were
   calculated from the steady-state contaminant plumes using decrease in
   concentration with distance downgradient and a single flow velocity
   estimate, as is commonly done in site characterization to support the
   interpretation of natural attenuation. The observed rates were found to
   underestimate the actual rate specified in the heterogeneous model in
   all cases. The discrepancy between the observed rate and the ``true{''}
   rate depended on the ground water flow velocity estimate, and increased
   with increasing heterogeneity in the aquifer. aquifer, For a lognormal K
   distribution with variance of 0.46, the estimate was no more than a
   factor of 1.4 slower than the true rate. For an aquifer with 20\%
   silt/clay lenses, the rate estimate was as much as nine times slower
   than the true rate. Homogeneous-permeability uniform-degradation rate
   simulations were used to generate predictions of remediation time with
   the rates estimated from the heterogeneous models. The homogeneous
   models generally overestimated the extent of remediation or
   underestimated remediation time, due to delayed degradation of
   contaminants in the low-K areas. Results suggest that aquifer
   characterization for natural attenuation at contaminated sites should
   include assessment of the presence and extent of, and contaminant
   concentrations in, low-permeability areas of an aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Integration of lithologic logs, geophysical logs, and hydraulic tests is
   critical in characterizing heterogeneous aquifers, Typically only a
   limited number of aquifer tests can be performed, and these need to be
   designed to provide hydraulic properties for the principle aquifers in
   the system. This study describes the integration of logs and aquifer
   tests in the development of a hydrostratigraphic model for the surficial
   aquifer system in and around Big Cypress National Preserve in eastern
   Collier County, Florida. Borehole flowmeter tests provide qualitative
   permeability profiles in most of 26 boreholes drilled in the study area.
   Flow logs indicate the depth of transmissive units, which are correlated
   across the study area. Comparison to published studies in adjacent areas
   indicates that the main limestone aquifer of the Tamiami Formation in
   the study area corresponds with the gray limestone aquifer in western
   Dade County and the water table and lower Tamiami Aquifer in western
   Collier County. Four strategically located, multiwell aquifer tests are
   used to quantify the qualitative permeability profiles provided by the
   flowmeter log analysis, The hydrostratigraphic model based on these
   results defines the main aquifer in the central part of the study area
   as unconfined to semiconfined with a transmissivity as high as 30,000
   m(2)/day. The aquifer decreases in transmissivity to less than 10,000
   m2/day in some parts of western Collier County, and becomes confined to
   the east and northeast of the study area, where transmissivity decreases
   to below 5000 m(2)/day.}},

Abstract = {{Hunt (1999) derived a model for computation of stream flow depletion
   caused by pumping from a well near a stream that does not fully
   penetrate the aquifer. The model input includes the transmissivity (T)
   and the storativity (S) of the aquifer and the conductance of the stream
   bed (lambda). We study the experimental and hydrogeological conditions
   for which drawdown analysis can be expected to produce T, S, and lambda
   estimates that can be used in the model of Hunt (1999) to predict
   depletion with a specified accuracy The study is conducted by using a
   combination of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis. The
   analysis shows that it is always important to have an accurate estimate
   of lambda in order to accurately predict depletion. Recommendations for
   the design of a pumping test near a stream are given to achieve this.
   The pumping well should be located close to the stream. Accurate
   drawdown measurements should be made both near the pumping well and near
   the stream, and the measurements should be used simultaneously to
   estimate T, S, and lambda. The duration of the pumping test should be
   relatively long in order to obtain an accurate estimate of lambda. A
   methodology is proposed in which a desired accuracy of either the
   estimates of T, S, and lambda., or the stream flow predicted from these
   estimates, is used to estimate the duration of the pumping test. Some
   examples indicate that in many cases the duration of the test should be
   from an hour to one or two months. However, if S is large (similar to
   10(-1)) and lambda is small (10(-7) m/s) then the duration should be
   from several months to years. This would be expensive and not practical,
   so other methods should be used to estimate lambda in this situation.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water inflows to drifts ranging from 700 to 1615 m below ground
   surface at the Con Mine, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada,
   were used to study deep hydrogeological flow regimes in Shield terrain.
   Salinity trends are due to mixing between low-TDS ground water and deep
   Ca(Na)-Cl brines (>290 g/L) likely derived from Devonian sea water. Cl-
   - delta(18)O relationships demonstrate that all inflows are a mixture of
   three distinct components: modern meteoric ground water (delta(18)O =
   -18.9 +/- 0.17 parts per thousand), brine (delta(18)O = -10 parts per
   thousand) and an isotopically depleted water (delta(18)O approximate to
   -28 parts per thousand). The origin of this third endmember is
   attributed to glacial melt water injected into the subsurface during
   ablation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet at ca, 10 lia, ri mechanism is
   proposed where high hydrostatic pressure in the ablation zone imposes
   strong downward gradients beneath the ice sheet margin. Numerical
   simulation with the SWIFT II finite-difference code recreates the
   observed salinity gradients within a modeled 50-year interval,
   corresponding with the rate of retreat of the ice sheet across the
   landscape at this time. The persistence of this melt water in the
   subsurface for some 10,000 years following retreat of the ice and decay
   of the steep hydraulic gradients highlights the importance of gradient,
   in addition to permeability, as a major control on ground water flow and
   transport in deep crystalline settings.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the use of the renewable ground water resources of the
   Eastern Desert to develop sustainable agriculture in Upper Egypt, an
   alternative that could alleviate some of Egypt's dependence on water
   from the Nile River, Ground water from shallow aquifers in the Eastern
   Desert of Egypt, near the intersection of Wadi El-Tarfa and the Nile
   River, was analyzed for chemical compositions, stable isotope ratios,
   and tritium activities. The ground water has a range in total dissolved
   solids of 300 to 5000 mg/L, Values of delta D and delta(18)O range from
   -10 to +34 parts per thousand and -2 to +5.2 parts per thousand,
   respectively, and defines a line having a slope of 5.7 that intersects
   the meteoric water line at about delta D = -15 parts per thousand on a
   plot of delta D versus delta(18)O. These findings indicate that the
   water might have been derived by a combination of evaporation of and
   salt addition to regional precipitation. Only one sample could have been
   derived directly by evaporation and transpiration of modern Nile River
   mater. Salinization of the ground water could have occurred through
   dissolution of marine aerosol dry fallout, carbonate minerals, gypsum,
   and other trace evaporitic minerals at and near the ground surface.
   Tritium activities ranged from 0.04 to 12.9 TU (tritium units),
   indicating that all but one of the samples were derived at least partly
   from precipitation that occurred within the last 45 years. These data
   indicate that Nubian Aquifer paleowater is not a significant component
   of the shallow aquifers of this portion of the Eastern Desert. The most
   likely source of this ground water is sporadic flash flood events
   yielding locally voluminous recharge that accumulates in coarse
   sediments and fractured rock beneath alluvial channels. The magnitude of
   this renewable ground water resource and its potential for supporting
   sustainable agriculture require further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Partitioning tracer tests (PTTs) are being used in environmental systems
   for the detection and estimation of nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)
   saturations in contaminated aquifers, A series of such studies was
   recently conducted at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, in in two hydraulically
   isolated test cells of an aquifer contaminated by light nonaqueous phase
   liquids (LNAPL), These experiments were performed before and after two
   remediation efforts, a complexing sugar flush (CSF) and a recirculating
   in-well aeration (IWA) system, The breakthrough curves obtained from
   monitoring tracer concentrations in the extraction wells indicated the
   presence of an immiscible phase, and the LNAPL saturation values
   determined from the pre- and post-PTTs allowed the estimation of
   remediation efficiencies for both test cells, These remediation
   efficiencies, a removal of 43\% of the LNAPL for the CSF and an increase
   increase of 32\% for the IWA system, are consistent with data obtained
   from ores collected from within the experiment zones. The apparent
   increase in contamination for the IWA cell is likely due to a
   significant change in the LNAPL distribution caused by the flow system
   associated with the IWA technology, Several factors influenced the
   interpretation of the PTT data. Physical heterogencities at the site
   caused significant tailing of the tracer concentrations and required the
   use of a simple extrapolation technique to account for the
   concentrations below analytical quantification limits, Degradation
   affected selected nonreactive and reactive tracers, causing the
   overestimation and underestimation of LNAPL saturations, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The Eocene-Oligocene Upper Castle Hayne Aquifer (UCH),a well-indurated
   limestone with a very high percentage of secondary moldic porosity, is
   one of the most productive and extensively developed aquifers in the
   North Carolina Coastal Plain. Ground mater from western wells in the UCH
   is Ca- and HCO3-rich and ground water from easternmost wells is alkali-
   and Cl-rich, In general, from west to east across the study area, Sr
   concentrations {[}Sr] and isotopic ratios of ground water from the UCH
   and other aquifers evolve toward those of the host aquifer. ht the same
   well site, water from older aquifers usually has a lower Sr-87/Sr-86
   ratio than water from younger aquifers, due to interaction between
   ground mater and sedimentary material in the host aquifers, Comparison
   of Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and {[}Sr] suggests that most UCH water represents
   mixing of strontium-poor recharge water from the Surficial Aquifer with
   varying amounts of strontium from the aquifer rock. For samples that
   deviate from the calculated mixing line, strontium ratios can often be
   used to indicate the source of strontium that did not come from UCH
   rock. Surface waters are characterized by high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and
   variable {[}Sr] that depend on the proportion of intermixed sea water
   Water from the overlying Yorktown and Pungo River aquifers call be
   recognized by higher Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios than those of the UCH and water
   from the underlying LCH, Beaufort, and Peedee aquifers can be recognized
   by lower Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and higher {[}Sr].}},

Abstract = {{The projected growth of Hernando County, located along the coast of
   west-central Florida, has motivated the county and the Southwest Florida
   Water Management District to assess ground water resources in the
   area,;is part of the Hernando County Water Resources Assessment Project,
   a computationally efficient modeling approach was developed to simulate
   regional ground water dow and salt water intrusion in two adjoining
   ground water basins in which Hernando County is located. In this
   modeling approach, the regional ground water now simulation was divided
   into two stages: fresh water and sharp-interface simulations. The first
   stage was performed using a calibrated fresh water model. Following the
   fresh water simulation, a calibrated sharp-interface model was used to
   evaluate the potential, extent of migration of the fresh water/salt
   mater interface as a result of implementing ground water management
   scenarios, Predictive modeling results indicate that projected future
   ground water withdrawals will cause less than 0.6 m of additional
   drawdown within Hernando County: Results also suggest that by the year
   2050 the fresh water/salt water interface will migrate landward less
   than 1.6 km from its 1994 position.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the unsaturated zone properties that affect
   ground water reaeration (i.e., the diffusive flux of oxygen through the
   unsaturated zone and into an aquifer system), Laboratory column
   experiments were undertaken to quantify oxygen flux into anaerobic
   ground water as a function of soil type, soil water content, soil oxygen
   demand, and unsaturated zone thickness. Soils used in these studies
   included coarse sand, sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, silt,
   silty flay loam, bentonite, kaolin, and peat, The results showed that
   reaeration flux rates ranging from 11,000 to 12,000 mg/m(2)-day u ere
   possible under conditions;;;: typical of the natural environment. Soil
   water content provided the greatest resistance to oxygen transport in
   the unsaturated zone while the remaining factors of soil type, soil
   oxygen demand, and unsaturated zone thickness did not significantly
   inhibit reaeration flux into ground water. An unsaturated zone transport
   model based on Fick's second law and gas-liquid interfacial mass
   transport was developed and showed good agreement with the experimental
   results derived from the column studies. The results of this study
   suggest that unsaturated zone reaeration of anaerobic ground water may
   be a contributing factor in controlling the steady-state size and shape
   of hydrocarbon plumes and incorporating reaeration into ground water
   models-based on unsaturated zone properties-may allow for a more
   accurate representation of bioattenuation reactions taking place in
   subsurface environments.}},

Abstract = {{Water discharging from numerous tunnels constructed during mining in the
   Wasatch Mountains near Salt Lake City, Utah, flows into nearby creeks,
   Disputes over ownership of water feeding the creeks have resulted in
   extensive litigation. In the course of a legal dispute over ownership of
   outflow from the Kentucky-Utah (K-U) Tunnel we evaluated the patterns
   and rates of ground water flow using an integrated study of the geology,
   chemistry, isotopes, and chlorofluorohydrocarbon (CFC) composition of
   the water. A sequence of sedimentary rocks with a range of hydraulic
   conductivity values has been folded, faulted, intruded by igneous rocks,
   and then eroded to create the rough topography of the Wasatch Mountains.
   The similarity of composition among tunnel discharge, springs, and base
   flow in the creek indicates that the creek is fed by ground water
   circulating in local, shallow flow systems. Results of numerical
   simulations of ground water flow indicate that the K-U Tunnel likely
   intercepts ground water that, in the absence of the tunnel, would
   ultimately flow in the subsurface to Big Cottonwood Creek. CFC and
   tritium contents of the water indicate flow weighted average ground
   water travel times range from four to 23 years and support our
   conclusion that water discharging from the tunnel is moving within a
   shallow ground water flow system. Despite sparse data, the scientific
   understanding was deemed sufficient for the judge to rule that owners of
   the surface water also own the tunnel discharge because, in the absence
   of the tunnel, this water would supply the stream.}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{A barrier well line's capture width along its alignment is shown to
   depend only on total system flow rate Q(T) and aquifer background flow
   rate per unit width Q(o) (prepumping gradient times transmissivity)
   under idealized horizontal flow: Irrespective of number of wells, the
   capture width is Q(T)/2Q(o), as for a hypothetical single well with flow
   rate Q(T). This result applies even to barrier lines with irregular well
   spacings and flow rates-and, in fact, to the capture width through the
   center of any pumping configuration that is symmetrical respecting a
   line perpendicular to uniform background pow A flow-perpendicular line
   of regularly spaced, equal wells ({''}regular barrier line{''}) has the
   same capture width along its alignment as an identical well line
   parallel to background pow has through its center. In the general
   symmetrical case, the center capture width remains Q(T)/2Q(o) whether
   transverse well spacings are large (allowing contaminated ground water
   to escape through capture zone gaps), critical (with incipient gaps), or
   safely small, For design reference, critical spacings derived for
   regular barrier lines of N wells with N through 100 and N-->infinity
   vary from Q/pi Q(o) (N = 2, previously known) to Q/2Q(o) (N-->infinity),
   where Q is each well's flow rate. Incipient gaps at critical spacing
   occur always between the two center wells, or the center well and two
   adjacent wells. Spacings substantially smaller than critical are
   recommended for contaminant capture. Designs are illustrated that
   preclude capture zone gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Travel time estimates for contaminant fronts or plumes are often
   obtained using estimates of average pore velocities from Darcy's law
   calculations. These estimates provide information only about the travel
   time of the average concentration (or the peak, for contaminant pulses).
   Equations are developed here for other portions of the breakthrough
   curve for a nonreactive contaminant, which allow estimates of travel
   time for concentrations other than the average or the peak. These travel
   time equations provide a simple method for calculating early arrival
   times for low concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model is used to predict flow along intervals between
   producing zones in open boreholes for comparison with measurements of
   borehole flow. The model gives flow under quasi-steady conditions as a
   function of the transmissivity and hydraulic head in an arbitrary number
   of zones communicating with each other along open boreholes. The theory
   shows that the amount of inflow to or outflow from the borehole under
   any one flow condition may not indicate relative zone transmissivity. A
   unique inversion for both hydraulic-head and transmissivity values is
   possible if flow is measured under two different conditions such as
   ambient and quasi-steady pumping, and if the difference in open-borehole
   water level between the two flow conditions is measured. The technique
   is shown to give useful estimates of water levels and transmissivities
   of two or more water-producing zones intersecting a single interval of
   open borehole under typical field conditions. Although the modeling
   technique involves some approximation, the principle limit on the
   accuracy of the method under field conditions is the measurement error
   in the flow log data. Flow measurements and pumping conditions are
   usually adjusted so that transmissivity estimates are most accurate for
   the most transmissive zones, and relative measurement error is
   proportionately larger for less transmissive zones. The most effective
   general application of the borehole-flow model results when the data are
   fit to models that systematically include more production zones of
   progressively smaller transmissivity values until model results show
   that all accuracy in the data set is exhausted.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Based on the column tracer test, we developed a research method to
   determine the hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity of saturated
   clays under low hydraulic gradients or small flow rates. Derived from
   Darcy's law and the solute transport equation, this method evaluates the
   hydraulic conductivity through measuring solute concentrations rather
   than by measuring flow rates. And the effective porosity is determined
   by applying an analytical solution of the one-dimensional uniform flow
   equation.
   Two types of experimental data drawn from a review of the literature and
   four sorts of accuracy test data carried out in the laboratory are used
   to examine the proposed method. The reproducibilities of accuracy tests
   for hydraulic conductivity determination indicate a consistency within a
   5.5\% error margin. The experimental results further indicate that
   hydraulic conductivities determined using the tracer method are more
   precise than those from the conventional flowmeter method. In addition,
   with the assistance of the proposed tracer method, we argue that the
   effective porosities may be overestimated as shown in the drawn example
   cases due to mistaking total pore volumes as the effective pores. The
   results of the accuracy tests further indicate that the effective
   porosities of saturated clay specimens are significantly smaller than
   the total porosities, at least when the samples are allowed to swell
   freely.}},

Abstract = {{The use of physical and hydraulic containment systems for the isolation
   of contaminated ground water and aquifer materials associated with
   hazardous waste sites has increased during the last decade, The existing
   methodologies for monitoring and evaluating leakage from hazardous waste
   containment systems rely primarily on limited hydraulic head data. The
   number of hydraulic head monitoring points available at most sites
   employing physical containment systems may be insufficient to identify
   significant leaks from the systems. A probabilistic approach for
   evaluating the performance of containment systems, based on estimations
   of apparent leakage rates, Is used to introduce a methodology for
   determining the minimum number of monitoring points necessary to
   Identify the hydraulic signature of leakage from a containment system.
   The probabilistic method is based on the principles of geometric
   probability, The method is demonstrated using three-dimensional ground
   water flow modeling results of leakage through a vertical barrier. The
   results indicate that the monitoring point spacing used at many
   hazardous waste sites likely is inadequate to detect the hydraulic
   signatures of all but the largest leaks.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water tracer tests are routinely performed to estimate aquifer
   flow and transport properties, including the determination of well
   capture zones, hydrogeologic parameters, and contaminant travel times.
   Investigators may be unaware of tracer test reporting requirements and
   may fail to notify their regulatory agency prior to conducting tracer
   tests. The injection of tracers falls under the jurisdiction of the
   federal Underground Injection Control (UIC) program, which regulates the
   introduction of substances into underground sources of drinking water as
   part of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The UIC program is administered by
   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by states with
   EPA-approved programs. The federal UIC program requires that tracer
   tests must not endanger underground sources of drinking water, and all
   tracer tests must be reported prior to injection. We contacted the UIC
   program administrator for every state in early 1997, Some states report
   having more stringent requirements, while some states do not meet
   minimum federal requirements. Although the primary responsibility for
   ground water tracer selection and use rests on the investigator,
   national guidance is required to assure compliance with the UIC program.
   To assist investigators, we present acceptable tracers that have been
   identified by two states, Nevada and South Carolina, that require no

   techniques are impractical in the profundal zone. As a result, many
   water balance calculations in these settings omit the ground water
   component altogether owing to the difficulties encountered in making the
   necessary hydraulic observations across the deeper lake bottom
   sediments.
   In this study, a methodology is developed for determining the flux into
   large, deep lakes using a combination of existing and recently developed
   techniques. The methodology is applied to the Hamilton Harbor, a natural
   bay at the western end of Lake Ontario, to estimate the ground water
   contribution to the harbor's water budget, Hydraulic gradients were
   monitored in 37 piezometers within the harbor during 1993 and 1994,
   Calculated hydraulic gradients, along with sediment hydraulic
   conductivities measured or estimated using a number of techniques, are
   used to estimate ground water flux to the harbor through Thiessen
   polygon weighting.
   Measured hydraulic gradients ranged from -0.333 to 0.430, the majority
   being upward indicating ground water discharge conditions. Gradients
   were varied across the harbor and increased in magnitude closer to
   shore. The total ground water contribution to the harbor was estimated
   to be 2.1 x 10(7) m(3)/yr, Compared with other hydrological components,
   ground water was slightly larger than the yearly precipitation input,
   and approximately 8\% of the total surface inflows to the harbor, and
   2\% of the total surface outflow through the Burlington ship canal,
   which connects the harbor to Lake Ontario.
   The computed ground water flux suggests that despite the fact that
   ground water flux: to large lakes may typically be a smaller input than
   surface water inputs, it is still a significant component of the overall
   water budget and should not be automatically omitted from water balance
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{We have imaged the temporal and spatial response of an unconfined
   aquifer during a pumping test using ground penetrating radar (GPR)
   profiling. In particular, we have observed the transient behavior of the
   reflection generated by the water content variation occurring in the
   transition zone between the overlying residually saturated material and
   the water saturated capillary fringe below The progressive arrival time
   delay of this reflection was measured and used to infer its drawdown
   that occurred during the pumping test. We also observed several other
   phenomena on the GPR profiles that are related to drainage: (1) the
   development of a series of diffractions indicating localized
   irregularities in water saturation and (2) the velocity pull-up of
   stratigraphic reflections due to increased electromagnetic (EM) wave
   velocity in the overlying section.
   Comparing the GPR profiling data and piezometer measurements, we have
   observed that the drawdown of the transition zone reflection is smaller
   and delayed relative to the measured hydraulic head drawdown, From the
   combined GPR and piezometer data, me have inferred that a 0.20 m
   increase in the combined thickness of the transition zone and capillary
   fringe occurred before the drawdown of the GPR transition zone
   reflection commenced. Once achieved, this 0.20 m increased thickness
   remained for the duration of the pumping test. Using the
   distance-drawdown relationship obtained from GPR profiling, we have
   estimated the drained water volume due to the downward movement of the
   transition zone. The results of our analysis account for only a fraction
   of the pumping well production, approximately 45\% on the first day and
   about 25\% on the second day. Of the various reasons examined to explain
   this result, we have concluded that it is likely that the behavior of
   the GPR reflection originating from the transition zone is
   representative of the shallower, less saturated portion of the
   transition zone and undetected drainage Is occurring in the deeper, more
   saturated portion of the transition zone.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{577-588}},

Abstract = {{Various physical and chemical properties were monitored sequentially in
   the field during well purging as indicators of stabilization of the
   composition of the water in the well. Turbidity was monitored on site
   during purging of oxic water from three wells with screened intervals
   open to an unconfined aquifer system in the Coastal Plain of southern
   New Jersey to determine if stabilization of turbidity is a reliable
   indicator of the optimum purge time required to collect unbiased trace
   element samples. Concurrent split (one filtered, one unfiltered) samples
   collected during purging of the wells were analyzed for concentrations
   of trace elements so that the relationships between trace element
   concentrations and turbidity could be compared.
   Turbidity correlated with the whole water recoverable (WWR)
   concentration of trace element species, such as iron (Fe), aluminum
   (Al), and manganese (Mn) in the oxic ground water. Turbidity appeared to
   be independent of other field-measured characteristics of water such as
   conductivity, pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. The WWR
   concentrations of lead and copper, considered to be hydrophobic,
   correlated significantly with the sum of the WWR concentration of Fe,
   Al, and Mn. High values of field-measured turbidity were a key indicator
   of an overestimate of ambient hydrophobic trace element WWR
   concentrations. Stabilization of turbidity was a better indicator of
   stable, unfiltered trace element concentrations than were the other
   commonly measured field characteristics. At one well, turbidity was a
   better indicator of stable, filtered trace element concentrations than
   the other commonly measured field characteristics. As analytical methods
   for trace elements improve resulting in smaller MRLs (method reporting
   levels) and better precision, turbidity of ground water at values of
   less than 10 NTU (nepheiometric turbidity units) will become important
   in interpreting the significance of both unfiltered and filtered sample
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of naturally occurring arsenic in ground water vary
   regionally due to a combination of climate and geology. Although
   slightly less than half of 30,000 arsenic analyses of ground water in
   the United States were less than or equal to 1 mu g/L, about 10\%
   exceeded 10 mu g/L. At a broad regional scale, arsenic concentrations
   exceeding 10 mu g/L appear to be more frequently observed in the western
   United States than in the eastern half. Arsenic concentrations in ground
   water of the Appalachian Highlands and the Atlantic Plain generally are
   very low (less than or equal to 1 mu g/L), Concentrations are somewhat
   greater in the Interior Plains and the Rocky Mountain System.
   Investigations of ground water in New England, Michigan, Minnesota,
   South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin within the last decade suggest
   that arsenic concentrations exceeding 10 mu g/L are more widespread and
   common than previously recognized.
   Arsenic release from iron oxide appears to he the most common cause of
   widespread arsenic concentrations exceeding 10 mu g/L in ground water.
   This can occur in response to different geochemical conditions,
   including release of arsenic to ground water through reaction of iron
   oxide with either natural or anthropogenic (i.e., petroleum products)
   organic carbon. Iron oxide also can release arsenic to alkaline ground
   water, such as that found in some felsic volcanic rocks and alkaline
   aquifers of the western United States. Sulfide minerals are both a
   source and sink for arsenic. Geothermal water and high evaporation rates
   also are associated,vith arsenic concentrations greater than or equal to
   10g/L in ground and surface water, particularly in the west.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of disinfection byproducts during aquifer storage and recovery
   (ASR) is evaluated for aquifers in southern Nevada, Rapid declines of
   haloacetic acid (HAA) concentrations during ASR, with associated little
   change in Cl concentration, indicate that HAAs decline primarily by in
   situ microbial oxidation, Dilution is only a minor contributor to HAA
   concentration declines during ASR. Trihalomethane (THM) concentrations
   generally increased during storage of artificial recharge (AR) water and
   then declined during recovery. The decline of THM concentrations during
   recovery was primarily from dilution of current season AR water with
   residual AR water remaining in the aquifer from previous ASR seasons and
   native ground water. In more recent ASR seasons, for wells with the
   longest history of ASR, brominated THMs declined during storage and
   recovery by processes in addition to dilution. These conclusions about
   THMs are indicated by THM/Cl values and supported by a comparison of
   measured and model predicted THM concentrations, Geochemical mixing
   models were constructed using major-ion chemistry of the three
   end-member waters to calculate predicted THM concentrations. The decline
   in brominated THM concentrations in addition to that from dilution may
   result from biotransformation processes.}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{The interface between fresh and saline ground water was studied in the
   Dead Sea area, using in situ profiles of electrical conductivity (EC) of
   water. The slope of the interface was found to be 10 times shallower
   than normally expected near the ocean because of the greater density
   contrast (the density of the Dead Sea is 1.23 g/cc), Although the Dead
   Sea system is extremely dynamic, the Ghyben-Herzberg approximation was
   still found to be relevant, The shallow interface is expected to cause
   Dead Sea water to intrude much farther inland than does sea water
   adjacent to oceans. This extremely shallow interface needs to be taken
   into account when exploiting ground water in this area in order to avoid
   upconing of brines and salinization.
   In recent times, the hydrologic system of the Dead Sea area has changed
   in water levels and salinity. Simulations using SUTRA code were run for
   a confined subaquifer to examine the effects of such change on the
   location of the fresh-saline water interface. Following the changes, the
   new interface is not parallel to the previous one because the increase
   in density causes a decrease in the interface's slope.}},

Abstract = {{Two experiments were conducted on Long Key, Florida, United States, to
   examine the fate of waste water following sewage disposal in 10 to 30 m
   deep injection wells. This waste disposal practice introduces
   extraordinary amounts of nutrients into the ground water of the Florida
   Kegs. In these experiments, artificial ground water tracers, sulfur
   hexafluoride (SF,) and radioiodine (I-131) were used to determine
   transport rates and directions of soluble nonreactive substances
   injected into the saline ground water underlying the Keys. Toro types of
   transport were observed: (1) rapid flow (0.20 to 2.20 m/hr) presumably
   due to the many conduits present in the limestone; and (2) slower flow
   (less than 0.003 to 0.14 m/hr) associated with the limestone's primary
   porosity, Vertical flow was comparable to horizontal flow due to either
   the density-driven buoyancy of the waste mater plume or to preferential
   flowpaths that allow upward advection or combination of both. These
   experiments showed that conservative artificial tracers injected into
   the subsurface reach surface water in a matter of days and can remain in
   the immediate vicinity of the injection well for several months.}},

Title = {{Problems associated with estimating ground water discharge and recharge
   from stream-discharge records}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{331-342}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Ground water discharge and recharge frequently have been estimated with
   hydrograph-separation techniques, but the critical assumptions of the
   techniques have not been investigated. The critical assumptions are that
   the hydraulic characteristics of the contributing aquifer (recession
   index) can be estimated from stream-discharge records; that periods of
   exclusively ground water discharge can be reliably identified; and that
   stream-discharge peaks approximate the magnitude and timing of recharge
   events. The first assumption was tested by estimating the recession
   index from stream-discharge hydrographs, ground water hydrographs, and
   hydraulic diffusivity estimates from aquifer tests in basins throughout
   the eastern United States and Montana. The recession index frequently
   could not be estimated reliably from stream-discharge records alone
   because many of the estimates of the recession index were greater than
   1000 days. The ratio of stream discharge during baseflow periods was two
   to 36 times greater than the maximum expected range of ground water
   discharge at 12 of the 13 field sites, The identification of the ground
   water component of stream-discharge records was ambiguous because
   drainage from bank-storage, wetlands, surface water bodies, soils, and
   snowpacks frequently exceeded ground mater discharge and also decreased
   exponentially during recession periods. The timing and magnitude of
   recharge events could not be ascertained from stream-discharge records
   at any of the sites investigated because recharge events were not
   directly correlated with stream peaks. When used alone, the
   recession-curve-displacement method and other hydrograph-separation
   techniques are poor tools for estimating ground water discharge or
   recharge because the major assumptions of the methods are commonly and
   grossly violated. Multiple, alternative methods of estimating ground
   water discharge and recharge should be used because of the uncertainty
   associated with any one technique.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and transport of radiocarbon in dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) in a thick clay-rich till aquitard was investigated.
   Radiocarbon activities decreased with depth from 109 percent modern
   carbon (pmC) in the surficial oxidized and fractured zone (at 1.5 m BG)
   through the thick underlying unoxidized and nonfractured aquitard,
   reaching minimum values of between 3 and 5 pmC at between 29 and 37 m
   depth. Numerical simulations of diffusive transport of radiocarbon from
   the oxidized zone into the unoxidized zone during the Holocene closely
   approximated the measured values and showed that diffusive transport and
   radioactive decay fully described the transport of radiocarbon in the
   aquitard, The lack of geochemical reactions involving DIC permitted the
   age of DIC in the pore water deposited,vith the till (between 29 and 37
   m BG) to be estimated at 25 to 31 ka BP. Results of this study showed
   that the use of radiocarbon in the study of solute transport in
   aquitards provides age information that cannot be obtained from natural
   conservative tracers such as delta(2)H and delta(18)O. Our results also
   showed that the application of conventional radiocarbon age-dating
   models based on piston-flow transport assumptions, is inappropriate in
   diffusion-dominated environments and considerably overestimates the age
   of the ground water.}},

Abstract = {{A conceptual model for ground water flow is presented for a fractured
   Silurian dolomite in the Niagara Escarpment area of southern Ontario.
   Such a model is necessary to facilitate remedial efforts of a
   PCB-contaminated site located in Smithville, Ontario. Both physical and
   chemical hydrogeological observations obtained from field investigations
   were used to deduce the structure of the ground water flow system in the
   fracture network. The field study was conducted using observations
   obtained from six boreholes drilled in the vicinity of the town of
   Smithville. The boreholes were diamond cored through the entire
   thickness of the dolomite formation (approximately 45 m), hydraulically
   tested using a 2 m packer spacing and then completed using multipacker
   casing strings. Measurements of hydraulic head were obtained on a weekly
   basis over a period of two gears, and ground water from each borehole
   interval was collected for geochemical analyses for inorganic and
   isotopic composition. Transmissivity measurements indicate that the
   dolomite is divided into two ground water flow systems separated by an
   extensive unit of low transmissivity that is pervasive throughout the
   region. The upper flow system is characterized by water enriched in Mg2+
   and SO42-. Below the low transmissivity zone, ground water increases in
   salinity and is enriched in Ca2+ and SO42-. Based on the geochemistry,
   the rate of ground water migration in the lower flow system is surmised
   to be much less than that in the upper system. Measurements of hydraulic
   head in conjunction with the results of the analyses of the
   environmental isotopes (delta(18)O and delta(2)H) suggest that ground
   water flow is mainly horizontal and likely governed by enlarged bedding
   plane fractures. The isotope geochemistry; and topographical features
   further suggest that ground water recharge is occurring approximately 2
   km to the north of Smithville.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrograph recessions from rainfall events have been previously analyzed
   for discharge at springs and streams; however, relatively little
   quantitative research has been conducted with regard to hydrograph
   analysis of recessions from monitoring wells screened in karst aquifers,
   In previous work, a quantitative hydrograph analysis technique has been
   proposed from which matrix transmissivity (i.e., transmissivity of
   intergranular porosity) and specific yields of matrix, fracture, and
   conduit components of the aquifer may be determined from well
   hydrographs, The technique has yielded realistic results at three sites
   tested by the authors (Y-12, Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Crane, Indiana; and
   Fort Campbell, Kentucky). Observed field data, as well as theoretical
   considerations, show that karst wed hydrographs are valid indicators of
   hydraulic properties of the associated karst aquifers, Results show
   matrix transmissivity (T) values to be in good agreement with values
   calculated using more traditional parameter estimation techniques, such
   as aquifer pumping tests and slug tests in matrix dominated wells. While
   the hydrograph analysis technique shows premise for obtaining reliable
   estimates of karst aquifer T with a simple, relatively inexpensive and
   passive method, the utility of the technique is limited in its
   application depending on site-specific hydrologic conditions, which
   include shadow submerged conduit systems located in areas with
   sufficient rainfall for water levels to respond to precipitation events.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experimental work has suggested that within a single bacterial
   strain there may exist two distinct subpopulations, each with its own
   sticking efficiency. We pel formed a sensitivity analysis using an
   advection-dispersion model to elucidate the effects of an influent
   suspension of bacteria composed of two subpopulations, each with
   distinct sticking efficiencies (dual-alpha population), on the removal
   and transport of bacteria over distances of tens of meters. In the
   simulations, me assumed idealized conditions (i.e., one-dimensional
   transport through physically and geochemically: homogeneous porous
   media). Results demonstrate that in cases where a small fraction of the
   influent bacteria have surface characteristics favorable for transport,
   the prediction of held-scale transport based on labaratory-derived
   parameters from short column experiments will tend to overestimate
   substantially the amount of bacterial removal, Results demonstrate the
   importance of a prior knowledge of the presence of intra-population
   variability when predicting the field-scale transport of bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{Stable hydrogen-isotope values of ground water (BH) and dissolved
   hydrogen concentrations (H-2(aq)) were quantified in a
   petroleum-hydrocarbon contaminated aquifer to determine whether the
   production/consumption of H-2 by subsurface microorganisms affects
   ground water delta(2)H values, The range of delta(2)H observed in
   monitoring wells sampled (-27.8 parts per thousand to -15.5 parts per
   thousand) was best explained, however, by seasonal differences in
   recharge temperature as indicated using ground water delta(18)O values,
   rather than isotopic exchange reactions involving the microbial cycling
   of H-2 during anaerobic petroleum-hydrocarbon biodegradation, The
   absence of a measurable hydrogen-isotope exchange between microbially
   cycled H-2 and ground water reflects the fact that the amount of H-2
   available from the anaerobic decomposition of petroleum hydrocarbons is
   small relative to the amount of hydrogen present in-water, even though
   milligram per liter concentrations of readily biodegradable contaminants
   are present at the study site. addilionally, isotopic fractionation
   calculations indicate that in order for H-2 cycling processes to affect
   delta(2)H values of ground water, relatively high concentrations of H-2
   (>0.080 M) would have to be maintained, considerably higher than the 0.2
   to 26 nM present at this site and characteristic of anaerobic conditions
   in general, These observations suggest that the conventional approach of
   using delta(2)H and delta(18)O values to determine recharge history is
   appropriate even for those ground water systems characterized by
   anaerobic conditions and extensive microbial H-2 cycling.}},

Title = {{Relation of pathways and transit times of recharge water to nitrate

Abstract = {{Oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope values of precipitation, irrigation
   water, soil mater, and ground mater were used with soil-moisture
   contents and water levels to estimate transit times and pathways of
   recharge water in the unsaturated zone of a sand and gravel aquifer,
   Nitrate-nitrogen (nitrate) concentrations in ground water were also
   measured to assess their relation to seasonal recharge. Stable isotope
   values indicated that recharge water usually had a transit time through
   the unsaturated zone of several weeks to months. However, wetting fronts
   usually moved through the unsaturated zone in hours to weeks, The much
   slower transit of isotopic signals than that of wetting fronts indicates
   that recharge was predominantly composed of older soil water that was
   displaced downward by more recent infiltrating water. Comparison of
   observed and simulated isotopic values from pure-piston flow and
   mixing-cell water and isotope mass balance models indicates that soil
   mater isotopic values were usually highly mixed, Thus, movement of
   recharge water did not occur following a pure piston-flow displacement
   model but rather follows a hydrid model involving displacement of mixed
   older soil water with new infiltration water. An exception to this model
   occurred in a topographic depression, where movement of mater along
   preferential flowpaths to the water table occurred within hours to days
   following spring thaw as result of depression-focused infiltration of
   snow melt. In an adjacent upland area, recharge of snow melt occurred
   one to two months later. Increases in nitrate concentrations at the
   mater table during April-May 1993 and 1994 in a topographic lowland
   within a corn field were related to recharge of water that had
   infiltrated the previous summer and was displaced from the unsaturated
   zone by spring infiltration. Increases in nitrate concentrations also
   occurred during July-August 1994 in response to recharge of water that
   infiltrated during May-August 1993, These results indicate that the
   largest ground water nitrate concentrations were associated with
   recharge of water that infiltrated into the soil during May-August, when
   most nitrogen fertilizer was applied.}},

Abstract = {{Data collected during ring infiltrometer tests are often analyzed while
   assuming either that the effect of gravity is negligible (early-time,
   transient data) or that it is dominant (late-time, steady-state data).
   In this paper, an equation is proposed for interpreting both early-time
   and late-time data measured during infiltration tests under falling head
   conditions. It is shown that the method used by previous authors for
   interpreting early-time data is a special case of the proposed equation.
   The equation is applied to data collected during tests performed in
   fine-grained soils, and results are discussed. The analysis suggests
   that to assume a priori values of the soil sorptive number, as indicated
   in the literature for various soils, may in some cases lead to severely
   underestimated values of the saturated hydraulic conductivity.
   Conversely, in low permeability soils, to assume steady-state gravity
   drainage may lead to order of magnitude overestimates of the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, A dimensionless analysis provides characteristic
   times that correspond either to the duration of the log-log half slope
   displayed by early-time data or to the log-log unit slope characteristic
   of late-time data.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the potential of using granular iron metal for the
   abiotic removal of the organic ground water pollutant trichloroethene
   (TCE) in the presence of the common inorganic co-contaminants chromate
   and nitrate, respectively. Our longterm column experiments indicate a
   competitive process between TCE dechlorination and reductive
   transformation of chromate and nitrate, which is reflected in a
   significantly delayed onset of TCE dechlorination, Delay times and
   therefore the ranges of the nonreactive flowpaths increased with
   increasing experimental duration, resulting in a migration of the
   contaminants through the iron metal treatment zone. The present
   investigation also indicates that the calculated migration rates of TCE
   and the added cocontaminants chromate and nitrate are linearly related
   to the initial content of the cocontaminants, With an average pore water
   velocity of 0.6 m/d and a surface area concentration of 0.55 m(2)/mL in
   the column, the calculated migration rates varied between 0.10 cm/d and
   5.86 cm/d. The particular similarity between the values of TCE migration
   and the migration of the strong oxidants chromate and nitrate and the
   long-term steady state of the TCE dechlorination in the absence of the
   chromate and nitrate indicates that these competitive transformations
   are the driving force for the gradual passivation of the granular iron
   due to the buildup of an electrically insulating Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide.
   Based on these passivation processes, general formulae were developed
   that allow a simplified approximation of breakthrough times for the
   contaminants TCE, chromate, and nitrate.}},

Abstract = {{In southern Ontario, vertical leakage through a regionally extensive
   till is the primary source of recharge to underlying aquifers used for
   domestic and municipal water supply, Since leakage is largely controlled
   by the bulk hydraulic conductivity (K) of the aquitard, accurate
   estimates of K art necessary to quantify the resource. Considerable
   controversy exists regarding estimates of K for this aquitard, which
   vary according to the scale of the test method. For the till matrix,
   estimates from core samples and slug tests consistently range from
   10(-11) to 10(-10) m/s, Isotopic evidence (3H), on the other hand,
   indicates that nonmatrix structures such as sand lenses, erosional
   surfaces,joints, and fractures significantly enhance till permeability,
   This is confirmed by slug test, pump test, recharge, and water balance
   studies, which show that K varies over seven orders of magnitude
   (10(-12) to 10(-5) m/s),
   To provide a regional estimate of bulk K and a reliable estimate of
   vertical recharge through the Northern Till, a numerical around water
   flow model was constructed for the Duffins and Petticoat Creek drainage
   basin. The model was calibrated to measurements of hydraulic head and
   estimates and measurements of baseflow throughout the basin. This model
   demonstrates that the vertical hydraulic conductivity (K-v) for the
   Northern Till ranges from 5 x 10(-10) to 5 X 10(-9) m/s, values that are
   up to 2.5 orders of magnitude greater than matrix K estimates. Regional
   recharge through the Northern Till is estimated to range from 30 to 35
   mm/a.}},

Abstract = {{Management of near-channel ground water and surface water to maintain
   stream health and floodplain ecological function requires
   hydrogeologists to refocus their conceptual models of water exchange
   between the aquifer and stream. The high hydraulic conductivity fluvial
   plain directs ground water flow down-plain where it exchanges with the
   stream channel creating gaining, losing, flow-through, and parallel-flow
   reaches. The resulting complex flow system requires consideration when
   profiles representing ground water flowpaths are constructed. In
   addition to interaction at the scale of the fluvial plain, exchange of
   ground mater and surface water within and immediately adjacent to the
   stream channel creates hyporheic zones. The physical and biogeochemical
   extent of these zones depends on the head distribution and ground water
   flow directions, stream hydraulics, and channel bed conditions, and
   magnitudes and distributions of hydrogeologic parameters. Simulated
   conceptualizations of flow dynamics caused by slight increases in
   hydraulic potentials at the surface water-stream bed interface indicate
   stream-ground water mixing could occur to a depth of 1.7 m below the
   channel. Rescaling of traditional hydrogeologic approaches to include
   the fluvial plain and channel scale will result in opportunities to
   expand hydrogeologic research and participate in interdisciplinary
   research teams attempting to decipher and manage fluvial systems.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{435-443}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Environmental scientists have long appreciated that the distribution
   coefficient (the ``K-d{''} or ``constant K-d{''}) approach predicts the
   partitioning of heavy metals between sediment and ground water
   inaccurately; nonetheless, transport models applied to problems of
   environmental protection and ground mater remediation almost invariably
   employ this technique, To examine the consequences of this practice, we
   consider transport in one dimension of Pb and other heavy metals through
   an aquifer containing hydrous ferric oxide, onto which many heavy metals
   sorb strongly, We compare the predictions of models calculated using the
   Ii, approach to those given by surface complexation theory, which is
   more realistic physically and chemically. The two modeling techniques
   give qualitatively differing results that lead to divergent cleanup
   strategies. The results for surface complexation theory show that water
   flushing is ineffective at displacing Pb from the sorbing surface. The
   effluent from such treatment contains a persistent ``tail{''} of small
   but significant levels of contamination, Subsurface zones of Pb
   contamination, furthermore, do not migrate rapidly or far in flowing
   ground water These results stand in sharp contrast to the predictions of
   models constructed using the K-d approach, yet are consistent with
   experience in the laboratory and field.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanisms controlling fluid flow through fractures intersecting
   chalk in the vadose zone were studied through mater percolation
   experiments in natural discrete fractures and by close examination of
   the inner structure of fracture voids. The percolation experiments
   showed that the flow is focused in dissolution channels along the
   fracture plane, and that fluxes and Row trajectories within that net
   vary in both time and space. The locations of the dissolution channels,
   the main potential flowpaths within the fracture plane, were generally
   associated with fracture intersections, The flow through. these channels
   was governed primarily by the mineralogical composition of the filling
   material and the inner structure of the fracture voids. Salt
   dissolution, solid-particle migration, and clay smelling were found to
   be the predominant processes controlling flow through the dissolution
   channels, These physical changes in the structure of the filling
   material in the dissolution channels accounted for the observed unstable
   flow behavior. Our results suggest that models aimed at simulating water
   percolation through fractures in unsaturated chalk should consider the
   mapping of fracture intersections in addition to the commonly used
   mapping of fracture lineaments, Moreover, the detailed characterization
   of fracture apertures may not he the key parameter determining fracture
   Row, because in such formations the flow. is controlled primarily. by
   filling material. These materials undergo significant physical
   variations during wetting and drying cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Salt precipitation and dissolution in fractured chalk was investigated
   through flow experiments in both the laboratory and the field tin the
   Negev Desert, Israel). In the laboratory, a flow-cell experimental setup
   was used to simulate intermittent infiltration and drying periods along
   coated and uncoated fracture surfaces. Three infiltration events,
   lasting 24, 8, and 8 hours, were carried out with long drying periods of
   82 and 44 days between them. In the field, two flow experiments were
   conducted through a single fracture. Water was percolated from land
   surface through a discrete fracture into a compartmental sampler, The
   duration of the two field experiments was 5 and 119 hours, respectively,
   with a drying period of seven months between them. The percolating
   outflows in both the laboratory and field experiments were collected and
   analyzed for electrical conductivity.
   The electrical conductivity of the outflows and its temporal variations
   during the experiments suggest that evaporation triggered capillary
   forces that mobilized water and solutes from the bulk matrix toward the
   fracture surface. As the water evaporated, the solutes precipitated on
   the fracture surface. The precipitated soluble salts were dissolved
   during the first few hours of the subsequent flow event that followed
   the drying period. This mechanism, enhanced in arid environments, may
   result in the transport of salts that accumulate in the upper few meters
   of the unsaturated zone to the ground water, bypassing the
   low-permeability matrix. The calculated amount of solutes transported by
   back-diffusion from the chalk matrix (190 g) could not account for the
   large (1200 g amount of salts released from the fracture void during the
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and hydraulic characterization of a
   cost-effective biocurtain that is currently being used to remove carbon
   tetrachloride from an aquifer in Schoolcraft, Michigan, Novel aspects of
   the design are the use of closely spaced wells to recirculate solutes
   through a biocurtain, well screens spanning the vertical extent of
   contamination, and a semipassive mode of operation, with only six hours
   of low-level pumping per meek. This design was developed by coupling now
   and transport simulations with a cost optimization algorithm, based on
   initial hydraulic conductivity data and system design constraints from a
   previous pilot-scale experiment adjacent to the current site. The
   hydraulic conductivity of the site was characterized using permeameter
   analysis on more than 200 samples from continuous well cores that were
   collected during well installation. The subset of available conductivity
   data was used to predict tracer transport through the biocurtain during
   system operation. Observed tracer concentration arrival histol ies
   during initial system operation confirmed model predictions. Modeling
   also established that closely spaced wells operated for brief periods
   each week could effectively deliver the agents needed for remediation
   across the biocurtain, This was confirmed during long-term operation of
   the system, which has resulted in highly efficient contamination
   degradation. The delivery well design methodology is expected to be
   broadly applicable at other sites where flow can be recirculated between
   a series of delivery wells.}},

Abstract = {{Water tables in the Netherlands have fallen due to human interventions
   in the water regime, causing hydrological degradation, particularly over
   the last 50 Sears, Factors responsible for this hydrological degradation
   are increased agricultural crop production, changes in land use,
   increased drainage, lowering of the drainage base, and increased ground
   water abstractions. Additionally, variations in the water regime have
   been caused by differences in meteorological conditions over a number of
   Sears. The physically based ground water and surface water model SIRIGRO
   was used to predict the effect of these human interventions. The
   analysis was carried out in three regions in the Netherlands and various
   scenarios were defined to represent the man-induced changes over the
   last 50 Sears, Changes in natural recharge of ground water and mater
   tables were used as indicators for the hydrological degradation, The
   calculations show that the natural recharge increases when water tables
   are deep. Variations in meteorological conditions over the last 50 years
   have a pronounced effect on the natural recharge, and the effect is
   greater than the changes caused by any of the human influences. The
   lowering of the drainage base causes the greatest change in ground mater
   tables.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{172-181}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The trench and gate remediation system is a funnel and gate design
   modified for installation in tills and other low permeability sediments.
   Modifications include the addition of high hydraulic conductivity
   trenches along the upgradient side of the funnel walls and a discharge
   reinfiltration gallery downgradient from the treatment gate.
   Preferential ground water flow through the high permeability; trenches
   and reinfiltration gallery prevents mounding, which otherwise forces
   flow beneath and around funnel walls. The resultant capture zone is
   larger both horizontally and vertically, than the cross-sectional funnel
   area and is significantly larger than the capture zone of a similar
   funnel and gate system. The system constitutes an economical, in situ,
   long-term contaminant plume capture and treatment method. In
   effectiveness and cost, the trench and gate system compares favorably
   with, or outperforms. other remediation systems in near-surface, ion
   permeability dissolved contaminant scenarios. A prototype trench and
   gate system was installed at the East Garrington Gas Plant, Alberta,
   Canada, in 1995, The installation demonstrated the effectiveness of the
   concept, and the system has successfully prevented off-site migration of
   dissolved hydrocarbon contaminants.}},

Title = {{Fractured-aquifer hydrogeology from geophysical logs: Brunswick Group
   and Lockatong Formation, Pennsylvania}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{182-192}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The Brunsnick Group and the underlying Lockatong Formation are composed
   of lithified Mesozoic sediments that constitute part of the Newark Basin
   in southeastern Pennsylvania. These fractured rocks form an important
   regional aquifer that consists of gradational sequences of shale,
   siltstone, and sandstone, with fluid transport occurring primarily in
   fractures, An extensive suite of geophysical logs was obtained in seven
   wells located at the borough of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, in order to
   better characterize the areal hydrogeologic system and provide
   guidelines for the refinement of numerical ground water models. Six of
   the seven wells are approximately 120 m deep and the seventh extends to
   a depth of 335 m. Temperature, fluid conductivity, and flowmeter logs
   are used to locate zones of fluid exchange and to quantify
   transmissivities. Electrical resistivity and natural gamma logs together
   yield detailed stratigraphic information, and digital acoustic
   televiewer data provide magnetically oriented images of the borehole
   wall from which almost 900 fractures are identified.
   Analyses of the geophysical data indicate that the aquifer penetrated by
   the deep well can be separated into two distinct structural domains,
   which may, in turn, reflect different mechanical responses to basin
   extension by different sedimentary units:
   1. In the shallow zone (above 125 m), the dominant fracture population
   consists of gently dipping bedding plane partings that strike N46
   degrees E and dip to the northwest at about 11 degrees. Fluid flow is
   concentrated in the upper 80 m along these subhorizontal fractures, with
   transmissivities rapidly diminishing in magnitude with depth.
   2. The zone below 125 m marks the appearance of numerous high-angle
   fractures that are orthogonal to the bedding planes, striking parallel
   but dipping steeply southeast at 77 degrees.
   This secondary set of fractures is associated with a fairly thick
   (approximately 60 m) high-resistivity, low-transmissivity sandstone unit
   that is abruptly terminated by a thin shale bed at a depth of 190 m.
   This lower contact effectively delineates the aquifer's vertical extent
   at this location because no detectable evidence of ground water movement
   is found below it. Thus, fluid flow is controlled by fractures, but
   fracture type and orientation are related to lithology. Finally, a
   transient thermal-conduction model is successfully applied to simulate
   observed temperature logs, thereby confirming the effects of
   ground-surface warming that occurred in the area as a result of
   urbanization at the turn of the century. The systematic warming of the
   upper 120 m has increased the transmissivity of this aquifer by almost
   10\%, simply due to changes in fluid viscosity and density.}},

Title = {{Empirical assessment of the influence of the unsaturated zone on aquifer

Abstract = {{Vulnerability assessments provide essential screening tools to focus
   efforts on prevention of ground mater contamination. The unsaturated
   zone, between the base of the soil and the phreatic surface, has an
   important role on the fate of contaminants, Yet most vulnerability
   assessments either do not address the unsaturated zone or overly
   simplify its effect on ground water contamination,
   In the Manawatu region of New Zealand, four factors have been found to
   predominantly control vulnerability: the soil, the unsaturated zone,
   rainfall recharge, and the aquifer medium. This paper focuses on
   assessing the spatial variability of the unsaturated zone. The model is
   based on an assessment of the total surface area available for sorption,
   or total sorption capacity of the unsaturated zone at each borehole,
   This assessment uses well drillers' logs, which provide the only
   available database covering the entire unsaturated zone of the study
   area, and published sorption values of various sediments to estimate
   vulnerability resulting from sorption capacity These ``point
   estimates{''} are treated as a spatially distributed parameter that can
   be contoured as a continuous surface. The entire modeling process was
   computerized in a geographical information system.
   Although the quality of drillers' logs varies considerably, high and low
   sorption areas can be distinguished readily, and the final map of
   unsaturated zone sorption shows clear regional trends. The sorption
   index generally decreases with distance from the recharge areas. The
   methods developed here can be applied and modified when necessary at
   other hydrogeological settings.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Genetic algorithm optimization of pump-and-treat ground water
   remediation is used to explore the extent of bias introduced into
   remediation designs and costs by sorption assumptions. Remediation
   problems with equilibrium sorption and two-site kinetic sorption with
   different mass transfer rates are addressed. Under the time-scales and
   flow conditions of contamination, all of these sorption assumptions
   created similar initial plumes. Thus, calibration of sorption parameters
   to the initial plume may be insufficient information to differentiate
   between sorption rates. Two optimization formulations were considered
   for each sorption assumption. In one formulation, the final water
   quality goal is with respect to the aqueous concentration; in the other,
   the goal is with respect to the total concentration (aqueous and
   sorbed), While remediation designs could be found with the aqueous
   concentration formulation. the total mass of contaminant remaining
   within the aquifer increases with decreasing mass transfer rates,
   creating the potential for concentration rebound after the pumping
   period ends. The designs found with the total concentration formulation
   avoid this difficulty, although it may: not always be possible to find
   feasible remediation schemes within the specified remediation period, If
   an optimal design based on the assumption of equilibrium sorption is
   applied to an aquifer with mass transfer limitations, the water quality
   goals may not be met within the specified remediation period. The length
   of time required to meet the water quality goals with this suboptimal
   design may increase exponentially as the mass transfer rate decreases,
   although aquifer heterogeneity reduces the scale of this effect.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a risk-cost approach for the design of soil vapor
   extraction (SVE) systems that takes into account uncertainties in the
   soil properties. The proposed design methodology consists of three
   separate models: a soil-gas flow and vapor transport model, a parameter
   uncertainty model, and a decision model based on a risk-cost objective
   function. A description of each of these models is provided and an
   example using a hypothetical scenario is given to illustrate the use of
   the methodology. Results from the example show that the methodology is
   suited for determining the number, location, and spacing of SVE
   extraction wells. The methodology can also be used to size the vacuum
   blower to be used and to predict when the SVE system should be shut off.}},

Abstract = {{Our ability to predict the response of large karstic basins to
   contaminant pulses and recharge events is limited due to an inability to
   model flow through these highly hetereogeneous and anisotropic basins.
   The linear systems technique is useful for simulating hydrologic
   processes occurring in karstic basins because detailed knowledge about
   the internal structure of the basin is not required. The objectives of
   this study were to predict changes in the quantity and quality of spring
   water in a large karstic basin using the linear systems approach. Using
   a dimensionless unit hydrograph, the change in quantity of spring water
   was predicted and the correlation coefficient, r, between predicted and
   observed discharges was 0.94. A nonpoint source kernel was used to
   predict the change in the specific conductance of the spring mater (r =
   0.97), A point-source kernel derived from a quantitative dye trace was
   used to predict the first arrival and dispersion of a contaminant at the
   spring (r = 0.11), Even though the correlation coefficient is low. the
   prediction matched the first and last appearances of the contaminant,
   Quantitative dye traces can be used to predict the movement of aqueous
   contaminants through karstic aquifers using the linear systems approach.
   Given the findings of this research, the linear systems approach is a
   useful predictive tool that would enable better management of ground
   water resources in karstic basins.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to assess the importance of the density
   difference between a tracer solution and ground water on the
   determination of aquifer properties by inversion of tracer signals. To
   estimate the effect of this density difference, we developed a
   nondimensional, approximate solution to a Boundary Value Problem (BVP)
   based on a partial differential equation first presented by Bear and
   Dagan (1964). The BVP models the displacement of water by another
   aqueous solution with a different density in a rectangular, vertical
   cross section of a homogeneous porous medium. A rectangular sandbox
   analog model was used to verify the validity S' of the nondimensional
   solution for the case of a moving interface during the displacement of
   water by a heavier-than-water aqueous solution. A constant flow rate was
   maintained by applying constant heads at a fully penetrating vertical
   inflow and outflow chamber. The theory, which can be applied as a
   prediction tool for laboratory experiments, permits us to explore the
   implications of using denser-than-water tracers for determining aquifer
   hydraulic conductivity and dispersion coefficient values. According to
   our assessments, density effects should not be ignored, as small density
   differences can lead to serious uncertainties in permeability and
   dispersivity determinations.}},

Abstract = {{Principal component anal sis was used to define patterns in water table
   hydrographs at four small, lake-watershed research sites in the United
   States. The analysis provided insights into (1) characteristics of
   ground water recharge in different parts of the watersheds; (2) the
   effect of seepage from lakes on water table fluctuations; and f3j the
   effect of differences in geologic properties on water table
   fluctuations, At two sites where all of the water table wells were
   completed in permeable deposits, glacial outwash in Minnesota and dune
   sand in Nebraska, the patterns of water table fluctuation primarily
   reflected timing and magnitude of recharge. The water table had more
   frequent and wider ranges in fluctuations where it was shallow compared
   with where it was deep. At two sites where the water table wells were
   completed in sand or till, a glaciated mountain valley in New Hampshire
   and stagnation moraine in North Dakota, the patterns of water table
   fluctuations were strongly related to the type of geologic unit in which
   the wells are completed. Furthermore, at the New Hampshire site, the
   patterns of water table fluctuations mere clearly different for cells
   completed in sand downgradient of a lake compared with those completed
   in sandy terraces on a mountainside. The study indicates that principal
   component analysis would be particularly useful for summarizing large
   data sets for the purpose of selecting index wells for long-term
   monitoring, which would greatly reduce the cost of monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrodynamic processes and mechanisms involved in rain infiltration
   and recharge in local areas of karst terrain can be identified and
   quantified by using measurements of the seepage of cave stalactites,
   Detailed measurements of the seepage of stalactites in seven caves
   located in an area close to the land surface, or the subcutaneous area
   of the karst, show a diversity of complex factors involved in
   infiltration: type of precipitation (rain or snow), air temperature,
   soil type and thickness, etc., which give rise to larger or smaller
   variations of flow in the espeleothem hydrographs,
   In some cases, no explanation can be found for the response of
   stalactites to rainfall, while in others there is a relationship between
   outer atmospheric parameters and the recharge represented by the
   stalactite drip. Romperopas Cave (Spain) has both a rapid and a basic
   flow, with hydrograph recessions similar to those observed in other
   caves. Water seepage in this cave varies greatly both in space and in
   time. The infiltration in Altamira Cave (Spain) was calculated and a
   multiple regression was found between infiltration, rain and outside air
   temperature. In other cases, the balance of the water on the soil is
   responsible for the seepage, Thus, a precipitation runoff numerical
   model that simulated the stalactite hydrographs could be applied to the
   Baradla and Beke Caves (Hungary), The complex properties of the ground,
   which are required for other flow numerical models for the unsaturated
   zone, were not taken into consideration.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model is used for simulating the stimulation of biomass
   growth by injection of alternating pulses of a primary substrate and
   oxygen, We consider that the substrate sorbs, whereas oxygen does not
   undergo mass transfer, and mixing of the reacting compounds is dominated
   by the chromatographic effect, Different mathematical formulations for
   biomass growth and decay are compared. In models considering biomass
   decay, a minimal time of joint exposure to both reactants can be
   determined. This leads to a multimodal distribution of the biomass after
   multiple injection cycles. in multidimensional heterogeneous domains,
   the location of the biomass peaks is determined by the advective arrival
   time. The biomass is much more homogeneously distributed when biomass
   decay is neglected, because under this condition there is no constraint
   by a minimal joint exposure time. For the case of oxygen-dependent
   biomass decay, an injection scheme using shorter pulses of higher oxygen
   concentrations is shown to he superior to a scheme with equally long
   pulses of oxygen and the substrate.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotope data (H-2 and O-18) were used in conjunction with
   chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and tritium/helium-3 (H-3/He-3) data to
   determine the fraction and age of irrigation water in ground water
   mixtures from farmed Darts of the Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP)
   Aquifer in south-central Idaho, Two groups of waters were recognized:
   ii) regional background mater, unaffected by irrigation and fertilizer
   application, and (2) mixtures of irrigation water from the Snake River
   with regional background water. New data are presented comparing CFC and
   H-3/He-3 dating of water recharged through deep fractured basalt, and
   dating of young fractions in ground water mixtures. The H-3/He-3 ages of
   irrigation water in most miutures ranged from about zero to eight years.
   The 6FC ages of irrigation water in mixtures ranged from values near
   those based on H-3/He-3 dating to values biased older than the H-3/He-3
   ages by as much as eight to 10 years. Unsaturated zone air had CFC-12
   and CFC-113 concentrations that were 60\% to 95\%, and 50\%; to 90\%,
   respectively, of modern air concentrations and were consistently
   contaminated with CFC-11. Irrigation water diverted from the Snake River
   was contaminated with CFC-11 but near solubility equilibrium with CFC-12
   and CFC-113, The dating indicates ground water velocities of 5 to 8 m/d
   for water along the top of the ESRP Aquifer near the southwestern
   boundary of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory
   (INEEL), Many of the regional background waters contain excess
   terrigenic helium with a He-3/He-4 isotope ratio of 7 X 10(-6) to 11 x
   10(6) (R/R-a congruent to 5 to 8) and could not be dated. Ratios of (CFC
   data indicate that some rangeland water may contain as much as 5\% to
   304e young water (ages of less than or equal to two to 11.5 years) mixed
   with old regional background water. The relatively low residence times
   of ground water in irrigated parts of the ESRP Aquifer and the dilution
   ffith low-NO3- irrigation water from the Snake River lon er the
   potential for NO3- contamination in agricultural areas.}},

Abstract = {{taminated Eocene aquifers at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina.
   The results address several important issues, including the use of
   multiple types of data in creating high-resolution aquifer models and
   the application of sequence-stratigraphic constraints. Specific
   procedures used include defining grid architecture stratigraphically,
   upscaling, modeling lithologic properties, and creating multiple
   equiprobabie realizations of aquifer straaigraphy, An important question
   answered by the study is how to incorporate gamma-ray
   borehole-geophysical data in areas of anomalous log response, which
   occurs commonly in aquifers and confining units of the Atlantic Coastal
   Plain and other areas, To overcome this problem, gamma-ray models were
   conditioned to grain-size and lithofacies realizations. The
   investigation contributes to identifying potential pathways for downward
   migration of contaminants. which have been detected in confirmed
   aquifers at the modeling site.
   The approach followed in this investigation produces quantitative,
   stratigraphically constrained, geocellular models that incorporate
   multiple types of data from borehole-geophysical logs and continuous
   cores. The use of core-based stochastic realizations in conditioning
   deterministic models provides the advantage of incorporating lithologic
   information based on direct observations of cores rather than using only
   indirect measurements from geophysical logs. The high resolution of the
   models is demonstrated by the representation of thin, discontinuous clay
   beds that act as local barriers to flow. The models are effective in
   depicting the contrasts in geometry and heterogeneity between sheet-like
   nearshore-transgressive sands and laterally discontinuous sands of
   complex shoreline environments.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the discharge of ground water to Shingobee Lake (66 ha),
   north-central Minnesota, is complicated by the presence of numerous
   springs situated adjacent to the lake and in the shallow portion of the
   lakebed, Springs first had to be located before these areas of more
   rapid discharge could be quantified. Two methods that rely on the
   distribution of aquatic plants are useful for locating springs. One
   method identifies areas of the near-shore lakebed where floating-leaf
   and emergent aquatic vegetation are absent. The second method uses the
   distribution of marsh marigold (Caltha palustris L,) to locate springs
   that discharge on land near the shoreline of the lake, Marsh marigold
   produces large (2 to -1 cm diameter) yellow flowers that provide a ready
   marker for locating ground water springs. Twice as many springs (38)
   were identified using this method as were identified using the lack of
   near-shore vegetation, A portable weir was used to measure discharge
   from onshore springs, and seepage meters mere used to measure discharge
   from near-shore springs. Of the total 56.7 h, s(-1) that enters the lake
   from ground water, approximately 30\% comes from onshore and near-shore
   springs.}},

Abstract = {{The success or failure of transport models in predicting the migration
   of a contaminant plume in ground mater depends to a large extent on the
   quality of flow and transport parameters used. in this study, we
   investigate the spatial variability in the tracer velocity and
   dispersivity in a shallow sandy aquifer in northern Belgium. Based on
   hydraulic conductivity measurements on cores sampled along a vertical
   profile, the aquifer was found to be mildly heterogeneous, i,e,, with
   the variance of the log-transformed conductivity K, sigma(lnK)(2), equal
   to 0.22. By means of a natural gradient tracer experiment, transport of
   a chloride tracer was investigated in a three-dimensional network of
   multilevel point samplers (MLS). Least squares fitting of a
   two-dimensional transport model to the individual breakthrough curves
   resulted in an average Longitudinal dispersivity that was 10 times
   larger than the transverse dispersivity. The results further showed the
   existence of a dispersion-scale Effect whereby the depth-averaged
   longitudinal dispersivity increases with increasing travel distance. The
   average longitudinal dispersivity corresponding to a travel distance of
   10 m was equal to 0.2 m, We finally show that theoretical expressions
   for the macroscopic dispersivity tensor, which require input on
   hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity, could be used here to
   approximately the observed dispersive behavior. These conceptually

Abstract = {{Steady-state analytical solutions are presented for estimating the
   ground water inflow rate to a mine pit that may contain a pit lake of
   finite depth. The solutions consider (1) the effect of decreased
   saturated thickness near the pit walls; (2) distributed recharge to the
   water table; and (3) upward flow through the pit bottom. While the
   solutions are not appropriate for all hydrogeologic situations, they are
   relevant to conditions encountered at many mine sites. An example
   calculation is presented for an actual mine pit containing a pit lake.
   The analytical solutions provide an estimated ground water inflow rate
   that is similar to the rate determined independently from a detailed
   water balance study.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water data variability and sample representativeness are
   controlled by internal monitoring-well flow and mixing, processes that
   require further investigation. By defining a representative sample using
   flow weighted average concentrations and modeling laminar wellbore flow,
   this study uses deviations from those representative concentrations as a
   measure of data variability. The laminar wellbore flow model relates
   ground water concentration and permeability distributions to the
   concentration response at a pump during purging or sampling, Given
   laminar wellbore flow, even if the concentrations within the well are
   not chemically altered, transient responses of concentrations to pumping
   lead to various amounts of variability depending on the screen length
   and position relative to hydraulic and chemical heterogeneities. in the
   simplest case, uniform inflow and inflowing concentrations, the
   concentration response to pumping is the same as the concentration
   response with thorough mixing. In more complex situations involving
   ground water concentration and permeability heterogeneities, pumped
   concentrations are controlled by those heterogeneities and wellbore
   flow, A model that describes concentration responses in the presence of
   linear heterogeneities allows a first-order approximation of variability
   during pumping. Using field screening of concentration and permeability
   heterogeneities, this first-order approximation can be used to design
   screen lengths that will limit the variability to study-specific
   tolerances, In the case of existing wells, measurement of inflows and
   concentration variability will allow the assessment of variability
   during pumping. This investigation demonstrates that, in order to
   decipher sources of data variability, investigations must examine
   internal wellbore processes in detail as well as the relationships to
   external conditions characterized in the field.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a sensitivity analysis of ground water flow on a spray
   irrigation site to evaluate key parameters affecting use of spray
   irrigation for sewage disposal. Spray irrigation is considered
   successful when water recharges the aquifer (low runoff) and mounding of
   the water table is below set Limits. It can be difficult to predict
   success and allowable irrigation rates given uncertainty in parameters.
   The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) code MODFLOW was used to compare two-
   and three-dimensional steady-state simulations, and three-dimensional
   transient simulations. We compared Latin hypercube sampling and
   systematic adjustment of parameters as methods of sensitivity analysis,
   transient versus steady-state sensitivity, and variations in layer
   configurations. These models were not calibrated because they were
   created during planning stages before field data became available,
   The Latin hypercube sampling effectively tested a large number of
   parameters simultaneously, and can be used as a screening toot for
   systematic adjustment of parameters. Transient and steady-state
   simulations predicted similar sensitivity to hydraulic conductivity, but
   steady-state modeling produced higher peak heads and discharges. Again,
   we recommend that the steady-state simulations could be used as a
   screening tool to evaluate trends. Transient modeling is likely to
   provide more realistic predictions of heads and discharges. When
   different layer configurations were compared, we found that
   two-dimensional modeling overpredicted mounding and drain discharge
   because flow in a permeable soil laver is neglected. Two-dimensional
   modeling would not be effective for predicting allowable irrigation
   rates. These results provide modelers an indication of the effects of
   model simplification, which can be used to plan modeling strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the natural heterogeneity of subsurface formations and to the
   often limited number of data, the definition of the physical and
   chemical parameters that govern flow and contaminant transport processes
   is normally characterized by a high level of uncertainty. Uncertainty in
   the relevant input parameters leads to uncertainty in modeling
   predictions, which may influence the selection of the optimal remedial
   alternative. This paper describes a statistical procedure for
   quantifying the uncertainty in modeling predictions made in support of
   the evaluation of ground water remediation designs. The hydraulic
   conductivity field is defined as a random spatial variable whose
   statistical structure is inferred from the available hydraulic
   conductivity data. Monte Carlo simulations are used to generate
   equiprobable multiple realizations of the hydraulic conductivity
   conditioned on the available hydraulic conductivity measurements. Using
   Bayes' theorem, probability-based weights for each of the hydraulic
   conductivity realizations are estimated fr om ``soft{''} data consisting
   of historical concentration data and contamination source information.
   The probability weights are expressed in terms of the simulated
   concentration distributions and the observed concentration data. Ground
   water flow and contaminant transport simulation models are then used to
   probabilistically evaluate and optimize ground water remediation schemes
   based on the statistical analysis of key model predictions, such as the
   probability of a particular part of the aquifer being within the capture
   zone of an extraction well, or the recovered mass of contaminants as a
   function of time.}},

Abstract = {{Sea water intrusion has occurred on the east and southeast coasts of
   Laizhou Bay, China, since the 1970s (Wu et al, 1993). In 1981, on the
   adjacent south coast, the intrusion of salt water originating from brine
   was observed. In this area, the salt water intrusion was caused by the
   excessive pumping of fresh water in aquifers, Moreover, the simultaneous
   pumping of fresh water and salt water/brine formed a complicated ground
   water flow field. The data obtained from observation webs were used to
   analyze the origin of the salt water and brine, and the genesis of the
   bicarbonate/sodium water zone. All data suggest that the brine
   originated from ancient sea water, and that the bicarbonate/sodium water
   was formed by cation exchange, The variations of chemical compositions
   along representative flowpaths and the relationships between such
   variations and salt water intrusion were also discussed.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon baildown tests involve the rapid removal of floating
   hydrocarbon from an observation or production well, followed by
   monitoring the rate of recovery of both the oil/air and oil/water
   interfaces, This test has been used erroneously for several years to
   calculate the ``true thickness{''} of hydrocarbon in the adjacent
   formation. More recent analysis of hydrocarbon distribution by Farr et
   al, (1990), Lenhard and Parker (1990), Huntley et ai, (1994), and others
   have shown that, under vertical equilibrium conditions, there is no
   thickness exaggeration of hydrocarbon in a monitoring well, though there
   is a significant volume exaggeration, This body of work can be used to
   demonstrate that the calculation of a ``true hydrocarbon thickness{''}
   using a baildown test has no basis in theory. The same body of work,
   however also demonstrates that hydrocarbon saturations are typically
   much less than one, and are often below 0.5, Because the relative
   permeability decreases as hydrocarbon saturation decreases, the
   effective conductivity and mobility of the hydrocarbon is much less than
   that of water, even ignoring the effects of increased viscosity and
   decreased;density.
   It is important to evaluate this decreased mobility of hydrocarbon due
   to partial pore saturation, as it has substantial impacts on both risk
   and remediation, This paper presents two analytic approaches to the
   analysis of hydrocarbon baildown test results to determine hydrocarbon
   transmissivity. The first approach is based on a modification of the
   Bouwer and Rice (1976) analysis of slug withdrawal test data. The second
   approach is based on a modification of Jacob and Lohman's (1952)
   constant draw-down-variable discharge aquifer test approach. The first
   approach can be applied only when the effective water transmissivity
   across the screened interval to water is much greater than the effective
   hydrocarbon transmissivity, When this condition is met, the two
   approaches give effectively identical results.}},

Abstract = {{The single-well dipole method proposed by Kabala (1993) has been tested
   at a field site in Denmark representing an alluvial sandy unconfined

   the originally proposed analytical solutions to the problem and a
   numerical model have been tested. The analysis showed that the hydraulic
   parameters determined from the test data were correlated, Particularly
   it was shown that the vertical hydraulic conductivity and the specific
   storage could not be determined to an acceptable degree of reliability
   when based on the originally proposed analytical solution and on
   measurements from only the dipole well. Instead, an inverse numerical
   multilayer model was proposed for parameter identification using the
   pressure response data measured not only in the dipole well but also in
   adjacent piezometers, The vertical profiles of horizontal and vertical
   hydraulic conductivities obtained at the site using the single-well

Abstract = {{Missing from most wellhead protection area (WHPA) delineation studies is
   a measure of the uncertainty associated with model predictions. A
   quantitative representation of that uncertainty can be used by
   regulators to implement different degrees of protection for areas with
   different degrees of certainty.
   Uncertainty analysis was performed for one- and five-year WHPA
   delineation for two municipal wells within a buried-valley
   glacial-outwash aquifer in southwestern Ohio. An approximation of the
   three-point Gauss-Hermite quadrature formula was used. This method is an
   alternative to simple Monte Carlo random sampling, typically requiring
   fewer model runs. It results in model-prediction expected values and
   variances and quantifies parameter main and two-way interactive effects.
   This study explored the collective impact of the uncertainties
   associated with six model parameters. Parameter probability density
   functions (PDFs) were based on field data and modified using a ground
   water pow model to ensure that all combinations of parameter values,
   within their PDFs, yielded an acceptable model calibration.
   The one-year WHPA for the upgradient well had a high degree of
   associated uncertainty represented by the difference in size between the
   WHPA low and high 95\% confidence interval limits. The large uncertainty
   was due to the uncertainties associated with model parameter values,
   especially effective porosity and horizontal hydraulic conductivity.
   River conductance also had a substantial impact on the WHPA predictions.
   The WHPAs for the downgradient well and the five-year WHPA for the
   upgradient well were limited by upgradient hydrogeologic boundaries;
   their prediction was, therefore, less sensitive to the uncertainties
   inherent in the model parameters.}},

Title = {{Hydraulic conductivities of low permeability sediments inferred from a
   triple pumping test and observed vertical gradients}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Knowing vertical conductivities of thick aquitards is important for
   simulating regional or local ground mater flow. These hydraulic
   parameters are best determined by calibration of these models.
   Collection of reliable data from heavily pumped ground water reservoirs
   can be problematic. Another way to infer these hydraulic parameters is
   the simultaneous interpretation of different parts of a multiple pumping
   test using an inverse numerical model. Here, the drawdowns observed in
   the indirectly pumped aquifers allow us to deduce the vertical
   conductivities of the aquitards with an equivalent accuracy as the
   horizontal conductivities of the aquifers, When the hydraulic
   resistances of the aquitards are too large, it becomes impossible to
   induce observable drawdowns in the indirectly pumped aquifers, and the
   inverse model loses valuable input data. Observing vertical gradients in
   and over the aquitards in case of important vertical now can make up for
   this loss. These data allow us to estimate the specific discharges
   through the successive parts of the aquitard and hence their hydraulic
   resistances, This useful information allows us to consider all these
   hydraulic resistances in one group of hydraulic parameters during the
   simultaneous interpretation of the multiple pumping test using an
   inverse numerical model. As this procedure reduces the number of
   identified parameter groups, it enhances their reliability, In this
   paper it is demonstrated how this reliability can be deduced from a
   number of statistical parameters that can also be used in the collinear
   diagnosis, The proposed interpretation procedure is demonstrated on a
   triple pumping test performed in and around the most important aquitard
   in Flanders, Belgium. The obtained results should first be integrated in
   a local ground water flow model. By the performance of a number of such
   integrated hydrogeological studies, the lateral change in the hydraulic
   properties of this aquitard can be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{To model ground water flow in a shallow aquifer underlying a salt marsh,
   the impact of total stress changes due to tidal loading of the marsh

   If the deformation of the porous medium is negligible, a ground water
   flow model may be modified to account for the changing total stress, The
   incorporation of these modifications into the U.S. Geological Survey
   (USGS) numerical model SUTRA is discussed, and example problems for
   which analytic solutions are available are presented to demonstrate the

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Many of the large ground water sources in the Chalk Aquifer have adits,
   horizontal tunnels below the ground water table, which are connected to
   pumped wells. The pow in an adit may be pipe or open channel flow. Adits
   in the United Kingdom are normally full of water, so that the adit flow
   is pressurized. Darcy's formula is not applicable to the adit, and
   conventional ground water models are inappropriate to model the
   aquifer-adit system. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) model BRANCH
   simulates one-dimensional unsteady, nonuniform, multiple-branch
   interconnected open channel now MODBRNCH incorporates BRANCH into
   MODFLOW simulating open channel and aquifer interaction using
   deterministic responses of both systems. An aquifer-adit model can be
   created by two steps, First, an integrated surface-ground water model
   (MODBRNCH) enables open channel flow to be simulated. Second,
   introducing a fictitious narrow slot (Preissmann slot) above the adit
   allows pipe flow to be simulated by open channel flow equations. The
   slot does not affect the adit cross-section area, and the water level in
   the slot represents the pressurized adit head, which can be used by
   MODBRNCH to calculate the water exchange between aquifer and adit
   according to their head difference, The approach has been tested on the
   Wilmington public supply source in southeast England.}},

Abstract = {{During the past decade or longer, large amounts of data on the
   concentrations of dissolved aromatic hydrocarbons have been obtained
   from routine monitoring of leaky underground storage tanks (USTs).
   Commonly, aromatic hydrocarbon concentration data is interpreted only
   within the context of regulatory maximum allowable concentration levels.
   We show in this paper how ternary diagrams can clearly characterize the
   physical and chemical controls governing the fate and transport of
   aromatic hydrocarbons in ground water from routine monitoring data.
   The results of type mathematical modeling experiments for BTS solute
   transport show that changes in BTX concentrations, when platted as
   proportions on ternary diagrams, form clear ``trajectories{''}
   documenting major attenuation or transport processes. For example, BTX
   concentrations affected by biodegradation form a trajectory from the
   source BTX location on the ternary diagram to the benzene apex, In
   contrast, BTX concentrations affected by volatilization form a
   trajectory trending from the source to the xylene apex, Ternary diagrams
   are easy and effective tools to determine from routine monitoring data
   (1) whether proposed natural attentuation processes are in fact present,
   and (2) the efficiency of different remediation efforts used to clean up
   UST sites.}},

Abstract = {{Based on a series of analyses of published data sets, it was observed
   that there is a consistent problem in the estimation of the vertical
   component of the hydraulic gradient. In mast cases investigated, data
   collected for a single field site led to individual estimates of the
   orientation of the gradient that fell close to both +90 degrees and -90
   degrees relative to the horizontal plane (i.e., the gradient was
   estimated to be oriented both vertically upward and vertically downward
   at the same site). Being consistent across most field sites analyzed,
   but inconsistent with our basic knowledge of hydrology (the impact of
   heterogeneity is distinct from the behavior presented here), alternative
   explanations for these observations were sought. Analysis using a simple
   numerical study showed that this behavior could be attributed to the
   presence of measurement error in the field data, The consistency of the
   field observations with the numerical study shows that errors in
   measuring the elevation of water in a well or piezometer may result in
   estimates of the vertical component of the gradient that are unreliable,
   effectively being measures of the difference in measurement error among
   wells, It is noted that this measurement error is in addition to local
   variations in the vertical component of the gradient that are related to
   heterogeneity or transients in the flow field. A formula is presented
   for the standard deviation of the error of the estimated vertical
   gradient as a function of both the measurement error and the relative
   location of the data points used in completing the estimate.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{121-128}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between the ground water sample and the surrounding
   ground water environment is controlled by wellbore non and mixing that
   carry ground water to the sampling device, Controlled laboratory
   conditions and uniform inflow and inflowing concentration allowed
   detailed investigations of wellbore concentration responses to
   pump-induced flow and mixing independent of external complicating
   influences. During pumping from the top of the screen, the results
   agreed with wellbore flow theory except for high-frequency,
   high-amplitude concentration fluctuations and mixing with the blank
   casing due to slight density contrasts (similar to 0.005\%).
   Concentration fluctuations indicated partial mixing of ground water with
   well water and declining concentrations in the blank casing indicated
   that convection due to the slight density contrast overcame pump-induced
   velocities, During pumping from the bottom of the well, opposing forces
   of buoyancy and pumping produced small-scale cumulative mixing as the
   ground water from different portions of the screen approached the pump.
   Even during low-flow pumping (i.e., 220 mL/min), 5\% of the water was
   prepurge well water after five well volumes were pumped, In the field
   the density contrasts that resulted in these mixing processes might be
   caused by a slight cooling of the wellhead or a slight increase in
   temperature with depth (>0.2 degrees C/m), If the temperature gradient
   was more pronounced, the convective mixing of screen water with the
   potentially altered casing water mould be more thorough and sampling
   without mixing would not be possible, If the temperature gradient is
   stable or if the water in the blank casing is not significantly altered,
   casing water mixing will not present a problem.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{In controlled field experiments or model aquifers, it is sometimes
   desirable to introduce solutes below the water table without perturbing
   the flow system. Diffusive emitters offer a means of achieving that
   goal. In this study, two laboratory experiments were conducted to
   evaluate nylon tubing as a diffusive emitter for tetrachloroethene
   (PCE), The initial approach was to pump a saturated aqueous PCE solution
   through a piece of nylon tubing immersed in a flow-through contactor
   vessel. Millipore water was pumped through the contractor vessel at a
   constant rate. Due to PCE diffusion through the nylon, a steady-state
   concentration in the contactor vessel eventually developed. The process
   was well described by a computer model that accounted for retarded
   diffusion through the nylon. In a second experiment, pieces of nylon
   tubing were exposed to a relatively low concentration of PCE in water
   for 10 days in gently rotated hypovials, With the aid of a second
   diffusion model, the bulk diffusion coefficient (lumped with the
   retardation factor) was obtained from the concentration history of the
   solution. With the different experimental conditions taken into account,
   there was reasonably good agreement between the bulk diffusion
   coefficients in the two experiments (a factor of 3.5 difference). The
   results were used in the field design of a semipassive release system.
   Evaluation of this system showed a lower than expected steady-state
   concentration of PCE inside the releasing wells. The difference is
   likely due to lower temperature, variable PCE concentrations in the
   nylon tubing, and nonideal mixing in the wells. The work has shown that
   laboratory derived diffusion coefficients for polymeric materials are
   likely to be larger than, but within an order of magnitude of, the
   effective diffusion coefficients exhibited by emitters in the field,
   Nevertheless, with temperature corrections taken into account and proper
   well development, these values could be used to design emitters that
   would suit most practical applications.}},

Abstract = {{A field-scale tracer experiment carried out under natural gradient
   ground water flow conditions showed that colloids can be highly mobile
   in a fractured and highly weathered shale saprolite. Four colloidal
   tracers (0.100 mu m fluorescent latex microspheres, bacteriophage
   strains PRD-1 and MS-2, and INA, a dead strain of Pseudemonas syringae),
   were introduced to a 6.4 m deep well, and concentrations of the tracers
   were monitored in the source well and in downgradient monitoring wells
   at distances of 2 to 35 m, till of the colloidal tracers were detected
   to distances of at least 13.5 m and two of the tracers (microspheres and
   INA) were detected in all of the downgradient wells. In most wells the
   colloidal tracers appeared as a ``pulse,{''} with rapid first arrival
   (corresponding to 5 to 200 m/d transport velocity), one to six days of
   high concentrations, and then a rapid decline to below the detection
   Limit. The colloids mere transported at velocities of up to 500 times
   faster than solute tracers (He, Ne, and rhodamine-WT) from previous
   tests at the site. This is believed to be largely due to greater
   diffusion of the solutes into the relatively immobile pore water of the
   fine-grained matrix between fractures. Peak colloid tracer
   concentrations in the monitoring wells varied substantially,,vith the
   microspheres exhibiting the highest relative concentrations and hence
   the least retention. Rates of concentration decline with distance also
   varied, indicating that retention is not a uniform process in this
   heterogeneous material, Two of the tracers, INA and PRD-1, reappeared in
   several monitoring wells one to five months after the initial pulse had
   passed, and the reappearance generally corresponds with increased
   seasonal precipitation. This is consistent with subsequent laboratory
   experiments that showed that colloid retention in these materials is
   sensitive to factors such as flow rate and ionic strength, both of which
   are expected to vary with the amount of precipitation.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{811-817}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{In situ iron removal is conducted routinely in a number of European
   countries. A volume of oxygenated water is injected, and subsequently a
   larger volume of ground water can be pumped with a lower iron
   concentration than is found in native ground water, The underlying
   reaction mechanism has not been well described so far, and the process
   has not been modeled quantitatively, The essential problem is how the
   electron transfer takes place between the dissolved oxygen in injection
   water and the dissolved iron in ground water, An intermediate reaction
   step, involving cation exchange of ferrous iron and subsequent oxidation
   by oxygen of injection water, explains the efficiency increase during
   the initial cycles and the absence of clogging by precipitated
   iron-oxyhydroxide, A hydrogeochemical transport model has been used to
   model column experiments with good results. The quantification of the
   reaction mechanism allows the assessment of operational conditions. For
   example, it can be shown that increasing the oxidant concentration in
   the injected water has an insignificant effect when exchangeable ferrous
   iron is low.}},

Title = {{Risk-based decision analysis of atmospheric emission alternatives to
   reduce ground water degradation on the European scale}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{818-826}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Environmental degradation due to emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrate
   oxides, and ammonia from diffuse sources amounts to substantial costs to
   society and so do the alternatives to protect and restore the
   environment. Damage to ground water includes acidification, aluminum
   leaching, elevated concentrations of nitrate, and eutrophication,
   Monetary risk-based decision analysis (on a national scale) is applied
   to compare alternative actions designed to protect ground water from
   further degradation. This decision analysis uses simulations of nitrate
   and aluminum concentrations over a 15 year period with two reduction
   scenarios for sulfur dioxide, nitrate oxides, and ammonia, and results
   in estimates of economic uncertainty. For each alternative, an objective
   function is estimated including the implementation costs, the economic
   risk associated with failure according to the selected decision
   criteria, and the economic benefits related to the implementation, The
   decision criteria are based on the European Community drinking water
   quality standards for nitrate and aluminum. The study aims at
   incorporating the hydrogeologic uncertainty resulting from the
   propagation of errors from data input to model output, A range of
   economic values has been applied to the ground water resource to study
   the sensitivity of the decision analysis to valuing ground water. The
   results indicate that higher reduction rates of the studied pollutants
   reduce the economic uncertainty but also lead to larger total costs. The
   study also indicates that the economic uncertainty may be equal to the
   total cost provided by the objective function. The contamination level
   of nitrate is much more responsive to the reduction scenarios than the
   aluminum concentration. For high, but not unrealistic, ground water
   valuing, the economic uncertainty makes the decision between the studied
   alternatives unclear.}},

Abstract = {{Slug tests performed in high transmissivity aquifers may exhibit
   underdamped herbal oscillatory behavior Analytical methods for
   oscillatory data have been developed, but are mathematically
   intimidating. Spreadsheet modeling is helpful because ready adjustments
   to the equations required to match the well-response data are quickly
   applied. A simplified presentation of the Kipp method for the practicing
   hydrogeologist is presented along with a spreadsheet model, A file
   containing the type curves is available over the Internet at
   www.mtech.edu from the Geological Engineering home page.
   Examples from southwestern Montana showing a variety of damping
   responses and well completions are presented to show how to perform the
   analysis. Sixteen well responses were modeled using the van der Kamp and
   Kipp methods, and the outcomes were compared using the two methods with
   oscillatory responses. Generally, there is good agreement between the
   methods. Screened wells tend to show more uniform oscillatory behavior,
   although open-hole completions can be analyzed with success. Other
   practical held applications and observations are presented.
   The theory describing inertial effects has been constrained to confined
   aquifers, although all aquifers exhibit elastic behavior during the
   initial disturbance from pumping or instantaneous slug removal.}},

Abstract = {{The combined use of geophysical (time domain reflectometry {[}TDR]),
   isotopic (delta(18)O and delta(2)H and chemical (NO3-N, Cl) techniques
   indicates that residence times in the unsaturated zone of a fractured
   basalt aquifer in the Pukekohe region of the North Island, New Zealand,
   are at least six months. Each technique provides useful information on
   specific aspects of recharge and residence times, but combined they
   provide a basis for determining the mechanisms of water movement in the
   unsaturated zone. TDR soil moisture measurements provide similar
   rainfall recharge estimates as model calculations over longer time
   periods (monthly or seasonal) but may be more accurate for shorter time
   scales (weekly or daily).
   The TDR measurements indicate that recharge occurs mainly in the late
   autumn and winter months. Measurements of nitrate concentrations in the
   soil profile over this same period, suggest that nitrate is mineralized
   in the soil during the summer and is flushed past the root zone at the
   beginning of the recharge period, in early winter. Nitrate
   concentrations in the soil profile do not increase in concentration
   later in the recharge period, even after significant recharge events
   have occurred, because all stored nitrate has already been released,
   This pattern of nitrate movement indicates that fertilizer applications
   in spring and early summer will leach less to ground water and
   applications made in autumn and winter will leach more. Estimations of
   yearly recharge from mean monthly chloride concentrations (730 mm/yr)
   are roughly in agreement with the TDR estimates (680 mm/year), However,
   there is a large range in the chloride estimates (> 100\%) because
   monthly chloride concentration measurements in both the rain and soil
   mater vary due to the proximity of the site to the ocean.}},

Abstract = {{An inverse computational method was used to analyze pumping and recovery
   tests conducted in an unconfined alluvial aquifer along the Republican
   River valley in Nebraska, At each test site, a high-capacity irrigation
   well was used as a pumping well, and eight observation wells were
   constructed to measure drawdown during the pumping and recovery tests.
   The test data were analyzed for four hydraulic parameters: the vertical
   (K(z)) and the radial (K(r)) hydraulic conductivity, the storage
   coefficient (S), and specific yield (S(y)), This method provides not
   only the average values but also estimated standard errors, confidence
   intervals, and correlation for the aquifer parameters. The standard
   error and confidence interval indicate the quality of the parameter
   estimates, and the correlation coefficients are useful in the evaluation
   of the relationship among the four parameters. High pumping rates seemed
   to reduce the effects of well borehole storage on drawdown, Because of
   the significant amount of early-time data collected, the tests gave
   high-quality S values, K(r) values for most observation locations range
   from 90 to 120 m/d, It was found that K(r) and S(y) had a higher
   correlation and the ratio of K(r)/K(z) varied from approximately 10 to

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The eater levels in wells are known to fluctuate in response to earth
   tides and changes in atmospheric pressure. These water level
   fluctuations can be analyzed to estimate transmissivity (T). A new
   method to estimate transmissivity, which assumes that the atmospheric
   pressure varies in a sinusoidal fashion, is presented. Data analysis for
   this simplified method involves using a set of type curves and
   estimating the ratio of the amplitudes of the well response over the
   atmospheric pressure.
   Type curves for this new method were generated based on a model for
   ground water flow between the well and aquifer developed by Cooper et
   al. (1965). Data analysis with this method confirmed these published
   results: (1) the amplitude ratio is a function of transmissivity, the
   well radius, and the frequency of the sinusoidal oscillation; and (2)
   the amplitude ratio is a weak function of storativity. Compared to other
   methods, the developed method involves simpler, more intuitive data
   analysis and allows shorter data sets to be analyzed.
   The effect of noise on estimating the amplitude ratio was evaluated and
   found to be more significant at lower T. For aquifers with low T, noise
   was shown to mask the water level fluctuations induced by atmospheric
   pressure changes. In addition, reducing the length of the data series
   did not affect the estimate of T, but the variance of the estimate was
   higher for the shorter series of noisy data.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive H-3-He-3 study was performed to determine detailed
   characteristics of a regional flow system and a sewage plume over a
   distance of 4 km in a sand and gravel aquifer at Otis Air Base in
   Falmouth, Massachusetts, H-3-He-3 ages increase with depth in individual
   piezometer clusters and with distance along flowpaths, However, the age
   gradient with depth (Delta t/Delta z) is smaller in the plume than that
   in the regional waters, due to the intense recharge in the infiltration
   beds, The 1960s bomb peak of tritium in precipitation is archived
   longitudinally along a flowline through the main axis of the plume and
   vertically in individual piezometer clusters, On the eastern side of the
   sampling area, where water from Ashumet Pond forces plume water deeper
   into the flow system, H-3-He-3 ages are young at depth because the
   H-3-He-3 ``clock{''} is reset due to ontgassing of helium in the pond. A
   reconstruction of the tritium input functions for the regional and plume
   samples shows that there is no offset in the peak {[}H-3] +
   {[}He-3(trit)] concentrations for the plume and regional water,
   indicating that the water from supply wells for use on the base is
   young. The H-3-He-3 ages and detergent concentrations in individual
   wells are consistent with the beginning of use of detergents and the
   time period when their concentrations in sewage would have been
   greatest. Ages and hydraulic properties calculated using the H-3-He-3
   data compare well with those from previous investigations and from
   particle-tracking simulations.}},

Abstract = {{A computer modeling technique is developed to simulate ground water
   drainage considering a heterogeneous, discontinuous layered formation
   with pumping wells screened in several layers and drawdown-induced
   recharge/discharge under complex urban hydrological conditions. A
   composite finite-difference mesh is used to simulate both the more
   distant areas (coarse mesh) and the actual drainage site (fine mesh).
   The skin loss parameters of screens are involved to control the aquifer
   yield. A pilot drainage scheme is being operated in Kuwait City to
   eliminate the harmful effects of water table elevation, The scheme
   involves six multiscreened pumping wells and numerous observation wells.
   Calibration through computer simulation indicated that the
   transmissivity exhibits relatively little areal variation, whereas the
   leakance of partially cemented silty beds and lenses fluctuates
   significantly over the study area. This heterogeneity effect as well as
   the induced recharge from various man-made sources have considerable
   impact on the drainage efficiency. Skin loss parameters of pumping wells
   affect the amplitude of drawdown in different aquifer units.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of in situ redox manipulation (ISRM) is to create a permeable
   treatment zone capable of removing redox-sensitive contaminants from
   ground mater. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of one promising ISRM technology: chemical reduction of
   aquifer sediments by sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) injection. The
   technology was evaluated in intermediate-scale laboratory experiments
   designed to investigate the kinetics of Fe(III)-reduction and
   dithionite-disproportionation reactions in a radial flow field over
   similar transport distances (similar to 7 m) and time scales (similar to
   72 hours) as those used Zn a field trial for remediation of chromate
   contaminated ground water at the Department of Energy Hanford site in
   Washington state. Four hundred liters (similar to 1 pore volume) of 0.1
   M Na2S2O4 in a 0.4 M K2CO3/0.04 M KHCO3 buffer were injected at a rate
   scaled to field values. Dithionite breakthrough curves at sampling ports
   were approximately described by the advection-dispersion equation with a
   two-part reaction model containing first-order rate coefficients for
   dithionite reaction with sediment Fe(III) (k(1) = 0.13 hr(-1)) and
   dithionite disproportionation (k(2) = 0.05 hr(-1)). Analyses on sediment
   cores collected from the physical model indicated that substantial
   Fe(III) was reduced to Fe(III) and that the dithionite-treated sediment
   was capable of removing 2 mg/L chromate from similar to 100 column pore
   volumes of synthetic ground water. These results indicate that the ISRM
   technology is a potentially feasible method for removing chromate from
   Hanford ground water.}},

Abstract = {{A large data set of more than 330 transient electromagnetic (TEM)
   soundings was collected in the southwest coast of Taiwan, The aims of
   the study were (1) to define the shallow geoelectrical structure, and
   (2) locate large bodies of ground water by integrating electrical
   anomalies and data from more than 140 wells, A one-dimensional,
   smooth-model inversion of TEM data was used, and trend surface analysis
   of those results was employed to refine the results for interpretation,
   A resistive zone (15 to 160 ohm-m resistivity) at elevations 20 to 120 m
   below sea level in the northern part of the survey area is interpreted
   as fresh water saturated sand or gravel, The southern part has extremely
   low resistivity, less than 1 ohm-m, indicating a widespread sea water
   intrusion. The divide between these two parts is located at about the
   middle of the study area. This study demonstrates that TEM investigation
   can help resolve ambiguities, even in an area with many wells, and
   thereby increase the likelihood of success in ground water exploration.}},

Abstract = {{Flow simulation is difficult to implement in heterogeneous media such as
   karst aquifers, primarily because the structure of the rock is extremely
   complex and usually unknown. The aim of this study was to verify the
   possibility of using inverse modeling and an equivalent porous media to
   identify transmissivities in a slightly karstified aquifer, the La
   Rochefoucauld karst (Charente, France), Different simulation scenarios
   were tested: using two spatial discretizations with different
   finite-element cell sizes and using measured or interpolated heads. The
   inverse modeling was performed with the downscaling parameterization
   procedure, using a finite-element representation of bidimensional ground
   water flow. The inverse modeling converged satisfactorily with all
   scenarios: head residuals were small and spring flow rates and the
   river/aquifer exchanges were adequately stimulated. The scenario using
   small cells and measured heads generated a highly heterogeneous
   transmissivity field, indicating an overparameterization of the problem.
   The calibrated transmissivities and simulated heads of this scenario
   proved less reliable overall than those of the other scenarios. The use
   of interpolated heads generated more uniform transmissivities as a
   result of the head smoothing. A rotation of the initial parameter mesh
   showed that the scenarios using interpolated heads generate the most
   stable and reliable results. The scenarios with interpolated heads could
   therefore be used when head measurements are limited or are unevenly
   distributed over the aquifer. Overall, the calibrated transmissivities
   reproduced the entire range of transmissivities measured in the field
   using different methods. The results indicate that inverse modeling and
   an equivalent porous media can be used to determine transmissivities in
   a moderately karstified aquifer.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{904-919}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Various types of sediments and rocks were analyzed for the relationship
   between hydraulic conductivity (K) and scale of measurement. No
   variations of K with scale were observed for homogeneous media such as
   quartz-arenites (quartz sandstones). However, hydraulic conductivity
   increased with scale of measurement in heterogeneous media. The scaling
   behavior can be described with the equation K = c (V)(m), where c is a
   parameter characteristic of the geological medium that relates to
   geological variables such as average pore size and pore
   interconnectivity in porous media, and probably fracture opening and
   fracture interconnectivity in fractured media. V is the volume of tested
   material (used as scale measure), and m is the exponent of the
   relationship (slope of the line on a log-log plot). The value of the
   exponent depends on the type or types of flow present. Porous flow media
   have an exponent of 0.5, multiple flow media an exponent between 0.5 and
   1.0, and fracture and conduit flow controlled media an exponent of about
   1.0, The more dominant fracture/conduit now is relative to porous flow,
   the closer the exponent is to 1.0, K increases with scale up to a rock
   volume after which the aquifer approaches the properties of an
   equivalent homogeneous medium and K remains constant with scale. This
   volume (upper bound of the relationship) is related to the degree of
   heterogeneity in a medium. It is at a much larger scale in karstic media
   (if encountered at all) than in nonkarstic and more homogeneous media,
   Both confined and unconfined aquifers exhibit a similar scale
   dependence.}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 40,000 residents in Palm Bay, Florida, rely on septic
   tanks as a means of sewage disposal and on weds as a drinking water
   source. High levels of precipitation (> 63 cm) during the months of July
   to September and the presence of porous sandy soils result in high water
   tables and septic tank overflows. The inability of septic tank leachate
   to percolate through the soil during the wet season results in ground
   water contamination, thus posing a health risk to those who drink from
   local wells.
   Sixty residential wells in Palm Bay were tested for fecal coliforms,
   nitrates, and phosphates to determine if season has a significant effect
   on the correlation between these parameters and the proximity of wells
   to septic tanks. Ground water samples collected at all distances from
   septic tanks during the wet season contained twice as many fecal
   coliforms and higher concentrations of nitrates and phosphates compared
   with samples collected during the dry season. Results showed a
   statistically significant correlation between increasing fecal coliform,
   nitrate, and phosphate concentrations and decreasing distance between
   wells and septic tanks.}},

Abstract = {{The Sand Hills of Nebraska, one of the largest grass-stabilized dune
   regions in the world, has nearly 5000 km(2) of wetland environments and
   is one of the most productive waterfowl regions of the United States,
   Yet, the hydrology of the region is not well defined. This paper
   presents the results of a two-and-a-half-year study to characterize the
   hydrology of two distinctly different interdunal valleys within the Sand
   Hills. The valleys, located at the Gudmundsen Sand Hills Laboratory in
   the central Sand Hills, reflect the two major types of interdunal
   environments: dry,short grass valleys (the east valley) and subirrigated
   wet meadows (the west valley), In the west valley, ground water flows
   from west to east and there are significant, upward vertical gradients
   (0.005 to 0.045), In contrast, ground water in the east valley
   predominantly flows from west-southwest to east-northeast. Where
   vertical gradients exist, they are downward (0.0025 to 0.07), Therefore,
   the east valley is a ``recharge{''} or flow-through valley. Seasonal
   ground water table fluctuations indicate that net recharge is greatest
   between growing seasons. The relatively high topographic relief of the
   water table on the flanks of the west valley, resulting from higher
   topographic relief of the adjacent dunes, drives ground water discharge
   into the valley wetland, developing a local how system, In contrast, the
   topography of the water table in the east valley, which is flanked by
   dunes with lower relief, is insufficient to generate a distinct local
   ground water flow system.}},

Title = {{Convergence of stochastic optimization and decision analysis in the
   engineering design of aquifer remediation}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{934-954}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares and contrasts stochastic optimization and decision
   analysis as frameworks for the design of remedial pump-and-treat systems
   in contaminated aquifers. Both decision-making frameworks (1) seek a
   least-cost, low-risk remedial design; (2) consider uncertainty due to
   partial knowledge of field environments, which causes imperfect
   predictive capability of simulation; (3) target predictive uncertainty
   due to spatially variable hydraulic conductivities and handle it by
   invoking geostatistical uncertainty theory, and (4) deal with the design
   and economic impacts of uncertainty by employing the concept of
   reliability or its complement the probability of failure. The
   fundamental difference between the two approaches lies in the fact that
   decision analysis considers a broad suite of technological strategies
   from which one of many predetermined design alternatives is selected as
   the best, while stochastic optimization determines the optimal
   pump-and-treat design but considers only one technological strategy at a
   time. The early stochastic optimization formulations sought to quantify
   the cost of overdesign needed to achieve greater performance
   reliability. The procedure involved a cost minimization that led to the
   development of a trade-off curve of cost versus reliability. For each
   point on the trade-off curve a single-valued optimum was achieved by
   defining a preset level of desired reliability. Decision analysis has
   always involved a cost-risk minimization, in which a single-valued
   optimum is obtained by simultaneously accounting for all costs,
   including the risk costs associated with the probability of failure.
   Risk costs are assigned a dollar value based on the level of expected
   reliability; a trade-off curve is not needed. More-recent formulations
   using stochastic optimization follow the philosophy of the
   decision-analysis framework by accounting for risk costs through a
   penalty cost. Using the latter approach, we show that the objective
   functions in both frameworks are virtually identical.
   A decision maker should adopt a decision-analysis framework if he or she
   (1) wants to minimize total system cost by selecting the best design
   alternatives from among a specified set, (2) has a known risk-cost
   preference (utility function), (3) wants to consider a broad suite of
   technological alternatives, and (4) is willing to accept the numbers,
   locations, and pumping rates for wells that are the best of those under
   consideration but are not necessarily optimal. The advantages of
   decision analysis lie in the ease with which capital costs can be
   incorporated, and the ability to examine alternative designs that span
   multiple technologies. The disadvantages revolve around the difficulty
   in determining a decision maker's utility function, selecting a
   single-valued design as the best from the predefined set of design
   alternatives, and the inefficiencies introduced by the need for a full
   enumeration of the design alternatives. A decision maker should adopt
   optimization if he or she (1) is interested in a truly optimal selection
   of well locations and pumping rates, (2) has an unknown or uncertain
   risk-cost preference, and (3) is comfortable considering a single
   remedial technology at a time. The advantages of optimization lie in its
   clever and efficient methodologies for identifying a global optimum. The
   main disadvantages he in the difficulties associated with a rigorous
   consideration of capital costs for nonlinear problems, and the fact that
   solutions do not typically span multiple technologies. The choice of
   whether to employ optimization or decision analysis as a design tool is
   not necessarily an either/or proposition, and we suggest possible
   avenues for their combined use.}},

Abstract = {{A modeling approach is developed to evaluate the potential for
   artificial recharge on alluvial fans in the Salinas Valley, California,
   using limited data of soil texture, soil hydraulic properties, and
   interwell stratigraphy. Promising areas for surface recharge are
   identified and mapped on a broad-scale using soil surveys, geologic
   investigations, permeability tests, and seasonal ground water response
   to rainfall and runoff. Two-dimensional representations of the vadose
   zone at selected sites are then constructed from drillers' logs and soil
   material types are estimated. Next, hydraulic properties are assigned to
   each soil material type by comparing them to laboratory-tested cores of
   similar soils taken from one site. Finally, water flow through the
   vadose zone is modeled in two dimensions at seven sites using a
   transient, finite-difference, variably saturated flow model. Average
   infiltration rates range from 0.84 to 1.54 cm/hr and recharge
   efficiency, the percentage of infiltrated water that reaches the water
   table, varies from 51\% to 79\%. Infiltration rates and recharge
   efficiency are found to be relatively insensitive to recharge basin
   pending depth due to the thickness of the vadose zones modeled (31 to 84
   m). The impact of artificial recharge on the Salinas Valley ground water
   basin is investigated by simulating the regional ground water response
   to surface spreading and streamflow augmentation with a recently
   calibrated, finite-element, ground water-surface water model for the
   basin. It was determined that a combined approach of surface recharge
   and streamflow augmentation significantly reduces the state of ground
   water overdraft and, to a lesser extent, reduces the rate of sea water
   intrusion.}},

Abstract = {{Recession flow has long been considered a composite of exponential
   terms, where each exponential term represents a different source of
   water discharged from the watershed. The changing slopes in the
   semi-logarithmic plot of the discharge have been considered indicative
   of the decreasing contribution of surface runoff and interflow to the
   discharge. The results of this analysis show that the changing slope in
   the recession plot can be the consequence of baseflow drainage. This can
   invalidate the semi-logarithmic baseflow separation technique when

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal characteristics of the saline springs that emerge
   along the western shore of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) are
   analyzed. Three groups of onshore springs (Tiberias, Fuliya, and Tabgha)
   and two groups of offshore springs (Barbutim and Maagan), contribute
   saline water to the lake with concentrations in the range of 300 to
   18,000 mgCl/L, depending on location and season. It is well accepted
   that water emerging from these springs is a mixture of two endmembers:
   deep-seated saline ground water and shallow, fresh circulating ground
   water. Temporal trends of discharge rates and of chloride (representing
   the deep saline aquifer) and nitrate (representing the shallow fresh
   water aquifer) concentrations within each group of springs are
   presented. Results show the proportions of the two water bodies while
   mixing are time dependent. Discharge and concentration peaks in Tabgha
   springs precede those in Fuliya and Tiberias springs by approximately
   two months. An analytical solution shows that in Tabgha, variations of
   these parameters are mainly controlled by recharge variations in the
   Galilee, and follow an exponential function. In Fuliya and Tiberias,
   variations of these parameters are mainly dependent on lake level, and
   follow a sine-cosine function. The different patterns are attributed to
   different hydraulic properties of the discharge area.}},

Abstract = {{Soil macropores are widely studied because they are known to serve as
   avenues for rapid contaminant transport. Currently, it is understood
   that a macroporous medium develops regions of mobile and immobile water
   during flow Consequently, solutes in the mobile phase bypass a
   considerable portion of the medium, thus limiting their natural
   attenuation. It is, however, not adequately documented in the literature
   what role the macropores play during intense rain events that result in
   variable pending depths.
   Macropore flow under ponded water conditions was studied on two
   undisturbed soil columns taken from the loam soils of northeastern Iowa,
   U.S. The columns were placed on a four-segment outflow collector system.
   A slug of water labeled with Br was applied to the columns followed by
   simulation of 58 mm of rain on column 1 and 53.6 mm on column 2, in one
   hour, 30 minute, and 15 minute events. During the highest intensity rain
   event (15 minutes), the total volume of water that exited through the
   bottom of segments 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 21.6\%, 34.5\%, 28.5\%, and
   15.4\% in column 1, and 1.3\%, 15.9\%, 72.2\%, and 10.5\% in column 2,
   respectively. As the intensity of rain was increased from one hour to
   the 15 minute event, the total bromide mass recovery increased from 45\%
   (29.2 mg) to 57\% (36.9 mg) of the total application (65 mg) for column
   1, and from 51\% (33.2 mg) to 59\% (38.2 mg) for column 2, respectively.
   Finally, an examination of dye-stained high flow regions in column 1
   demonstrated that macro-porosities made approximately 20\% of the total
   cross-sectional area of the column.
   These results suggest that solute transport behavior in macroporous
   soils can be impacted by pending depths, and intense rain events can
   severely restrict contaminant degradation in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical properties of combined Shewhart-CUSUM control charts are
   examined in terms of the site-wide false positive rate, false negative
   rate, and average run length (i.e., the average number of sampling
   events that it takes to detect a significant exceedance). The effects of
   multiple comparisons (i.e., multiple monitoring wells and constituents),
   verification resampling, background sample size, and background updating
   are incorporated into the analysis. The effects of (1) verification
   resampling plans including no resampling, pass one resample, pass one of
   two resamples, and pass two of two resamples; (2) background sample
   sizes (n = 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24); and (3) multiple comparisons (k = 1
   to 500 future comparisons) were examined. In addition, various
   alternative control limit factors (h = SCL = 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, and 6.0)
   were considered, where the control limit is (x) over bar + hs. Results
   of simulations revealed that it is possible to balance site-wide false
   positive and false negative rates at low levels using combined
   Shewhart-CUSUM control charts. The results revealed that it is important
   to select the appropriate multiplier, verification resampling plan,
   number of background samples, and number of intervening samples prior to
   updating background.}},

Abstract = {{Pumping and slug tests are widely used, relatively simple methods for
   estimating hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient. This study
   tested the reproducibility of pumping and slug tests in estimating
   aquifer parameters in fractured or fractured porous media. The continuum
   concept is applied to represent the hydraulic properties by the
   conventional conductivity and storage coefficient. Repeated tests show
   discrepancies wider than can be attributed to probable measurement
   errors or incomplete curve fitting. The sources of discrepancy include
   turbulent head loss in an observation well, pumping well location, data
   acquisition period (pumping or recovery), selection of analysis method,
   test initiation mechanism, applied initial displacement, and selection
   of data segment for analysis. When we employ a specific test practice or
   choose a specific analysis method or data segment for the analysis, the
   resulting parameter estimates show characteristic patterns of
   distribution with respect to the mean value. This study analyzes the
   patterns and discusses how to improve the reliability of the parameter
   estimation.}},

Abstract = {{Regardless of the chemical controls for a pollutant on sediment sorption
   or release from an immiscible organic liquid, a simple mass balance can
   be used to predict the retardation of the ground water pollutant front
   moving downstream from a source of constant composition. The retardation
   is the ratio of the total molar difference of pollutant across the front
   to the molar difference in ground water. The mass-balance approach
   presented here uses a flushing factor for the entire front. It is
   implicit in the commonly used retardation factor for pollutants
   undergoing linear sorption, but does not appear to have been used to
   predict retardation of concentration fronts involving nonlinear sorption
   or partitioning in hydrochemical studies. Yet the computations require
   only limited experimental or field data or the use of an algorithm
   describing sorption or partitioning of the pollutant. Close agreement
   was obtained between retardations predicted using the mass-balance
   approach and those reported from numerical modeling and column
   experiments in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and xylene (BTEX) dissolved into ground
   water and migrated from a light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) source
   in a sandy aquifer near a petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) facility
   at Hill Air Force Base (AFB), Utah. Field observations indicated that
   microbially mediated BTEX degradation using multiple terminal
   electron-accepting processes including aerobic respiration,
   denitrification, Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, and
   methanogenesis has occurred in the aquifer. To study the transport and
   transformation of dissolved BTEX compounds under natural conditions, a
   reactive flow and transport model incorporating biochemical multispecies
   interactions and BTEX was developed. The BTEX, oxygen, nitrate, Fe(II),
   sulfate, and methane plumes calculated by the model agree reasonably
   well with field observations. The first-order biodegradation rate
   constants, estimated based on model calibration are 0.051, 0.031, 0.005,
   0.004, and 0.002 day(-1) for aerobic respiration, denitrification,
   Fe(III), sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis, respectively. The
   results of a sensitivity analysis show that the saturated aquifer
   thickness, hydraulic conductivity, and reaction rate constants are the
   most critical parameters controlling the natural attenuation of BTEX at
   this site. The hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness were found
   to be the key factors affecting the restoration of oxygen, nitrate, and
   sulfate after their interaction with the BTEX plume. The multispecies
   reactive transport modeling effort, describing BTEX degradation mediated
   by multiple electron-accepting processes, represents one of the few
   attempts to date to quantify a complete sequence of natural attenuation
   processes with a detailed field data set. Because the case study is
   representative of many petroleum-product contaminated sites, the results
   and insights obtained from this study are of general interest and
   relevance to other fuel-hydrocarbon natural attenuation sites.}},

Abstract = {{Faulted aquifers constitute one of the most complex geological
   environments for analysis and interpretation of hydraulic test data
   because of the inherent ability of faults to act not only as highly
   transmissive zones but also as hydraulic barriers. Previous studies of
   the fractured carbonate aquifer at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada,
   characterized the flow regime as predominantly linear, but with limited
   radial nature, and undertook to analyze constant discharge test data
   using both radial and linear pow models. When used as direct input to a
   numerical model, the hydraulic parameters, calculated directly from
   hydraulic test data, were inappropriate and resulted in a poorly
   calibrated model. While our interpretation of the faulted aquifer
   remains linear-radial in nature, parameter estimation by numerical
   simulation highlighted the presence of hydraulic barriers associated
   with the faults. These barriers are not readily apparent in the constant
   discharge test data and act to modify the hydraulic test curves at early
   to mid time, leading to incorrect estimates of the hydraulic parameters.
   This paper describes the conceptual model and the numerical approach,
   and demonstrates the importance of using transient simulations for model
   calibration.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water production wells commonly are designed to maximize well
   yield and, therefore, may be screened over several water-bearing zones.
   These water-bearing zones usually are identified, and their
   hydrogeologic characteristics and water quality are inferred, on the
   basis of indirect data such as geologic and geophysical logs. Production
   well designs based on these data may result in wells that are drilled
   deeper than necessary and are screened through zones having low
   permeability or poor-quality ground water. In this study, we examined
   the application of flowmeter logging and depth-dependent water quality
   samples for the improved design of production wells in a complex
   hydrogeologic setting. As a demonstration of these techniques, a
   flowmeter log and depth-dependent water quality data were collected from
   a long-screened production well within a multilayered coastal aquifer
   system in the Santa Clara-Calleguas Basin, Ventura County, California.
   Results showed that the well yields most of its water from four zones
   that constitute 58\% of the screened interval. The importance of these
   zones to well yield was not readily discernible from indirect geologic
   or geophysical data. The flowmeter logs and downhole water quality data
   also show that small quantities of poor-quality water could degrade the
   overall quality of water from the well. The data obtained from one well
   can be applied to other proposed wells in the same hydrologic basin. The
   application of flowmeter and depth-dependent water quality data to well
   design can reduce installation costs and improve the quantity and
   quality of water produced from wells in complex multiple-aquifer
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cluster variable aperture (CVA) simulated annealing has been used as an
   inversion technique to construct fluid flow models of fractured
   formations based on transient pressure data from hydraulic tests. A
   two-dimensional fracture network system is represented as a filled
   regular lattice of fracture elements. The algorithm iteratively changes
   element apertures for a cluster of fracture elements in order to improve
   the match to observed pressure transients. Aperture size is chosen
   randomly from a list of discrete apertures. The cluster size is held
   constant throughout the iterations. Since hydraulic inversion is
   inherently nonunique, it is important to use additional information. We
   investigated the relationship between the scale of heterogeneity and the
   optimal cluster size and shape to enhance convergence of the inversion
   and improve the results. In a spatially correlated transmissivity field,
   a cluster size corresponding to about 20\% to 40\% of the practical
   range of the spatial correlation is optimal. Inversion results of the
   Raymond test site data are also presented and based on an optimal
   cluster size; the practical range of the spatial correlation is
   estimated to be 5 to 10 m.}},

Abstract = {{An objective methodology is proposed for assessing potential ground
   water yield on the basis of the randomness inherent in hydrogeological
   parameters as a result of uncertainty. Randomness is used here in the
   statistical sense to describe the ground water phenomenon on a regional
   basis. A systematic approach to selecting aquifer parameters is
   presented that leads to reliable ground water storage and subsurface
   flow estimates by incorporating a certain risk level. In addition, the
   averages of the specific ground water capacity and subsurface flow rate
   are calculated through a perturbation approach. This study demonstrates
   that cross-correlations between basic hydrogeologic variables might
   underestimate or overestimate model parameter values.
   Furthermore, the results of aquifer storage and subsurface flow
   estimates are obtained in the form of probability distribution
   functions. It is proved that the surface flow rates are presented by a
   log-normal distribution. Contrary to conventional point estimate, a
   simple and objective methodology is proposed in order to obtain the most
   probable interval estimates. Accordingly, projections of likely future
   ground water storage and flow rates can be readily calculated.}},

Abstract = {{Under certain circumstances, wells in unconfined aquifers can display
   significant water level fluctuations in response to changes in
   barometric pressure. This is illustrated by Hare and Morse (1997) at a
   site where a portion of the unconfined aquifer is isolated by a
   soil-bentonite cutoff wall and clay cap. A relief well located within
   the containment system displays water level fluctuations that mirror
   barometric pressure changes. Water levels fluctuated 0.37 m in response
   to barometric pressure changes of 2.87 centimeters mercury (cm-Hg),
   representing a barometric efficiency of 93.6\%. As described in this
   paper, the short-term variability in water level elevations inside the
   containment system had to be considered to develop a reliable
   post-enhancement performance monitoring program. The approach that was
   ultimately selected involves correcting the water level elevations
   obtained in the relief well within the containment system for the
   effects of barometric pressure changes prior to comparison with the
   water level elevations in an observation well in the aquifer outside the
   system. The reliability of the post-enhancement performance monitoring
   program is improved further by simply requiring that any decision to
   enhance the containment system be based on the water level measurements
   obtained during two consecutive months. Using this approach, the
   probability that the containment system's performance will erroneously
   be deemed unacceptable is low. The post-enhancement performance
   monitoring program also requires no extra field work and does not
   involve any specialized equipment, which helps to keep operation and
   maintenance costs to a minimum.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional numerical modeling is used to characterize ground
   water flow and contaminant transport at the Shoal nuclear test site in
   north-central Nevada. The fractured rock aquifer at the site is modeled
   using an equivalent porous medium approach. Field data are used to
   characterize the fracture system into classes: large, medium, and
   no/small fracture zones. Hydraulic conductivities are assigned based on
   discrete interval measurements. Contaminants from the Shoal test are
   assumed to all be located within the cavity. Several challenging issues
   are addressed in this study. Radionuclides are apportioned between
   surface deposits and volume deposits in nuclear melt glass, based on
   their volatility and previous observations. Surface-deposited
   radionuclides are released hydraulically after equilibration of the
   cavity with the surrounding ground water system, and as a function of
   ground water flow through the higher-porosity cavity into the
   low-porosity surrounding aquifer, processes that are modeled include the
   release functions, retardation, radioactive decay, prompt injection, and
   ingrowth of daughter products. Prompt injection of radionuclides away
   from the cavity is found to increase the arrival of mass at the control
   plane but is not found to significantly impact calculated concentrations
   due to increased spreading. Behavior of the other radionuclides is
   affected by the slow chemical release and retardation behavior. The
   transport calculations are sensitive to many flow and transport
   parameters. Most important are the heterogeneity of the flow field and
   effective porosity. The effect of porosity in radioactive decay is
   crucial and has not been adequately addressed in the literature. For
   reactive solutes, retardation and the glass dissolution rate are also
   critical.}},

Abstract = {{A natural-gradient tracer experiment was conducted to study Cd transport
   in an alluvial gravel aquifer. Both a conservative tracer and Cd
   exhibited tailing in their breakthrough curves (BTCs), indicating the
   presence of nonequilibrium transport. Solute transport was evaluated
   using a three-dimensional nonequilibrium analytical model, and the
   results were compared with those obtained from a previous laboratory
   study. At similar flow velocities, the field Cd data gave significantly
   lower retardation factors (R=7 to 30, median 22), higher fractions of
   instantaneous sorption sites (beta), and greater mass transfer
   coefficients (omega) than the laboratory data because of a high degree
   of aquifer heterogeneity, the presence of preferential flow and the
   larger transport scale in the field conditions. Multiple peaks in the Cd
   BTCs were observed due to bacteria-facilitated and perhaps also
   colloid-facilitated transport. The early peaks showed narrower, more
   symmetric shapes with higher concentrations than the later peaks, and
   compared well to those of the bacterial BTCs. The multiple peaks of the
   Cd BTCs imply that a significant fraction of Cd could travel with
   little, if any, retardation over a 20 to 40 m travel distance when Cd
   and bacteria coexist in a contamination event.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a heuristic model of mixing and aerobic
   degradation based on a conceptual understanding of the mixing process in
   heterogeneous media, rather than on a rigorous derivation from the
   stochastic transport equations. The mean-behavior, heuristic approach,
   with a uniform velocity field, was used to reproduce organic plume
   behavior from a previously published simulation for random pore water
   velocity fields. The heuristic model presented herein requires that the
   mixing coefficient be calibrated to explain field data; therefore, in
   that sense, the model is not predictive. The numerical model uses a
   modified form of a particle tracking model to account for multispecies
   transport. Transport simulation includes a random-walk component, while
   biodegradation is simulated with Monod kinetics. Numerical simulations
   are presented for nonreactive transport in homogeneous media, and for
   reactive transport in heterogeneous media. A sensitivity analysis of the
   model is performed to determine the effect of the mixing coefficient in
   the model.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of perched water near the potential high-level nuclear
   waste repository area at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, has important
   implications for waste isolation. Perched water occurs because of sharp
   contrasts in rock properties, in particular between the strongly
   fractured repository host rock (the Topopah Spring welded tuff) and the
   immediately underlying vitrophyric (glassy) subunit, in which fractures
   are sealed by clays that were formed by alteration of the volcanic
   glass. The vitrophyre acts as a vertical barrier to unsaturated flow
   throughout much of the potential repository area. Geochemical analyses
   (Yang et al, 1996) indicate that perched water is relatively young,
   perhaps younger than 10,000 years. Given the low permeability of the
   rock matric, fractures and perhaps fault zones must play a crucial role
   in unsaturated flow. The geologic setting of the major perched water
   bodies under Yucca Mountain suggests that faults commonly form barriers
   to lateral flow at the level of the repository horizon, but may also
   form important pathways for vertical infiltration from the repository
   horizon down to the water table, Using the numerical code UNSAT2, two
   factors believed to influence the perched water system at Yucca
   Mountain, climate and fault-zone permeability; are explored. The
   two-dimensional model predicts that the volume of water held within the
   perched water system may greatly increase under wetter climatic
   conditions, and that perched water bodies may drain to the water table
   along fault zones. Modeling results also show fault flow to be
   significantly attenuated in the Paintbrush Tuff non-welded hydrogeologic
   unit.}},

Abstract = {{High concentrations of dissolved iron in ground water of coastal plain
   or alluvial aquifers contribute to the biofouling of public supply wells
   for which treatment and remediation is costly, Many of these aquifers,
   however contain zones in which microbial sulfate reduction and the
   associated precipitation of iron-sulfide minerals decreases iron
   mobility. The principal water-bearing aquifer (Magothy Aquifer of
   Cretaceous age) in Suffolk County, New York, contains localized
   sulfate-reducing zones in and near lignite deposits, which generally are
   associated with clay lenses. Microbial analyses of core samples amended
   with {[}C-14]-acetate indicate that microbial sulfate reduction is the
   predominant terminal-electron-accepting process (TEAP) in poorly
   permeable, lignite-rich sediments at shallow depths and near the ground
   water divide. The sulfate-reducing zones are characterized by abundant
   lignite and iron-sulfide minerals, low concentrations of Fe(III)
   oxyhydroxides, and by proximity to clay lenses that contain pore water
   with relatively high concentrations of sulfate and dissolved organic
   carbon. The low permeability of these zones and, hence, the long
   residence time of ground water within them, permit the preservation and
   (or) allow the formation of iron-sulfide minerals, including pyrite and
   marcasite, Both sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and iron-reducing
   bacteria (IRB) are present beneath and beyond the shallow
   sulfate-reducing zones, A unique Fe(III)-reducing organism, MD-612, was
   found in core sediments from a depth of 187 m near the southern shore of
   Long Island. The distribution of poorly permeable, lignite-rich,
   sulfate-reducing zones with decreased iron concentration is varied
   within the principal aquifer and accounts for the observed distribution
   of dissolved sulfate, iron, and iron sulfides in the aquifer, Locating
   such zones for the placement of production wells would be difficult,
   however because these zones are of limited aerial extent.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents numerical experiments designed to simulate heat
   transfer in deformed, stratified geologic formations during Frasch
   thermal mining operations in the Delaware Basin. In such operations,
   superheated water (163 degrees C) is injected into permeable ore zones
   to melt and mobilize sulfur, The efficiency of Frasch mining depends
   largely on various aspects of hydrologic controls and geologic factors,
   such as directing heat flow toward target areas and minimizing heat
   dissipation through advection and conduction in ore zones. Numerical
   modeling techniques were used in the search of an optimum thermal mining
   strategy for maximum sulfur recovery in various geologic settings
   present at the Culberson Mine, west Texas. The sample calculations
   illustrate heat transfer patterns in inclined, folded, and fractured
   geologic formations. Important results presented include the controls of
   geologic structures on directions and rates of heat transfer and ground
   water flow a display of field evidence for the occurrence of thermal
   convection in permeable ore zones, and a depiction of heat transfer
   during a thermal mining operation proceeding down-dip along an inclined
   geologic unit. Modeling results and field data strongly support the
   hypothesis that thermal convection occurs and controls the heat transfer
   process in inclined ore zones. Simulations further suggest that the
   current thermal mining practice, which proceeds down-slope along an
   inclined ore zone, may result in lowered ultimate sulfur recovery. In
   this mining approach most heat migrates up-slope where the rock's
   permeability is enhanced by previous sulfur extraction, rather than
   down-dip toward the target area.}},

Abstract = {{In engineered in situ bioremediation, substrates are injected into the
   subsurface to stimulate microbial metabolism and growth. Models are
   useful in the design and optimization of such systems, such as in
   devising strategies to prevent clogging of soil by large bacterial
   populations around wells, Such models are macroscale, i.e., they do not
   resolve pore-scale variability; rather, substrate and biomass
   concentrations are bulk averages that vary from block to block, These
   models give unrealistic predictions, in that they predict monotonically
   increasing biomass growth everywhere except where the Limiting substrate
   concentration is very small, This work examines the possibility of
   biofilm mass-transfer limitations at the pore scale using both the
   traditional biofilm model as well as previously published results from
   an upscaling model, Results from the biofilm model suggest that
   limitations on biofilm growth due to mass-transfer resistance could be
   significant in coarse-grained soils with adequate substrate
   availability, The upscaling approach confirms this result, While these
   two approaches do not yield identical results, both do agree that
   coarser grain sizes tend to cause greater mass transfer resistance.
   These are the conditions most likely to occur near injection well
   screens of an enhanced bioremediation system, where clogging is most
   commonly observed, The upscaling approach also indicates that the degree
   of mass transfer resistance is reduced at higher ground water
   velocities, which are also most commonly observed near well screens.
   These results could be useful for improving macroscale bioremediation
   models to more accurately predict rates of biomass growth and aquifer
   clogging.}},

Abstract = {{In the finite difference modeling of unsaturated infiltration by
   Richards' equation, standard interblock conductivity means like the
   arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic have been shown to produce flows
   different from true Darcian by up to orders of magnitude (Warrick 1991;
   Baker 1995a, 1998). This may have significant impact on models used for
   contaminant transport of nuclear and other hazardous waste, Previously,
   it has been impractical to calculate Darcian means in a running model.
   This paper introduces the analytic solution for Darcian means for the
   case of an exponential relative conductivity relation, and one possible
   approximation for general use, a piecewise Brooks-Corey Darcian (PBCD)
   mean. It compares the PBCD mean to the arithmetic mean in a modern
   mass-conservative numerical model (Celia et al, 1990) for vertical space
   steps from 0.8 to 105 cm, using soil parameters from Haverkamp et al.
   (1977). The results demonstrate that even in a model with mass balance
   good to one part in 10(8), non-Darcian flow errors are alive and well,
   costing up to 50\% of the total mass infiltrated with the arithmetic
   mean and large model space steps. The new PBCD mean reduces that figure
   to 0.5\% for this example soil.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical modeling tool ITOUGH2 was examined to determine its
   effectiveness in parameter estimation for the small scale seals
   performance tests (SSSPT) at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near
   Carlsbad, New Mexico. Gas flow injection tests were performed at various
   distances inward from the wall of Room D to estimate the effects of
   creeping of the disturbed rock zone (DRZ) since excavation of Room D and
   boreholes, and to estimate the amount of healing of the DRZ that has
   taken place due to an emplaced concrete seal, Salt creeping into an
   excavation is expected to show increased porosity and absolute
   permeability values compared to undisturbed halite. Healed halite is
   expected to show porosity and absolute permeability values comparable to
   that of undisturbed halite. Single-phase now estimates of absolute
   permeability were made using ITOUGH2, Estimates of DRZ absolute
   permeability ranged from 10(-11) near Room D to 10(-21) m(2) at the
   seal. Simultaneous estimates of absolute permeability and porosity were
   calculated for the disturbed rock zone in halite, and the effects of
   salt creep and healing were seen in the estimates of porosity and
   absolute permeability, as evidenced by the differences in absolute
   permeability and porosity with distance inward from the rib of Room D,
   Estimate of porosity were 0.04 near Room D, and the locations near the
   seal showed porosities of around 0.03, ITOUGH2 proved effective in
   interpreting test data seen in the SSSPT; especially test data with
   constant injection pressure.}},

Title = {{A mathematical model for the hydraulic properties of deforming porous

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},

Pages = {{546-554}},

Abstract = {{A new and relatively simple mathematical model is presented to predict
   the changes in porosity and saturated hydraulic conductivity that result
   from the skeletal deformation of porous media. A mathematical expression
   for the deformation-dependent porosity is derived from the relationship
   between porosity and volumetric strain, assuming that the individual
   solid grains are relatively incompressible or less deformable compared
   to the solid skeleton of a porous medium. A mathematical expression for
   the deformation-dependent saturated hydraulic conductivity is then
   obtained by substituting the deformation-dependent porosity into the
   Kozeny-Carman equation, assuming that the shape factor of the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity is independent of the skeletal deformation of the
   porous medium. To evaluate the effects of the deformation-dependencies
   of the hydraulic properties on poroelastic consolidation, the
   mathematical model is applied to two different numerical experiments on
   fully saturated porous media. The simulation results show that the
   deformation-dependencies of the hydraulic properties intrinsically
   induce hydraulic heterogeneity and nonlinear consolidation, and hence
   produce different trends than those obtained from analytical or
   numerical solutions with an assumption of constant hydraulic properties.
   Although the mathematical model presented in this paper is not
   applicable to all hydrogeomechanical phenomena, the methodology should
   have useful application in many consolidation problems.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersed growth model incorporating Monod kinetics has often been
   applied to simulate enhanced in situ bioremediation of contaminants. The
   dispersed growth model might not adequately address the impacts of the
   growth of large bacterial populations that can often have the unwanted
   effect of clogging the porous media. Two mechanisms that could affect
   model predictions of biomass are biofouling and biomass detachment due
   to shear stress. A mathematical model was developed to evaluate the
   potential impact of shear detachment on biomass distribution and the
   prediction of contaminant biodegradation by comparing the impact of both
   shear detachment and biofouling together with that of biofouling alone.
   The results of this examination can aid in designing a system for in
   situ bioremediation using computer simulations and in evaluating a
   system's ability to meet remediation goals. The model simulations
   indicate that shear detachment of biomass can be an important process to
   include in model simulations used to predict the effectiveness of a
   bioremediation system and the time before significant clogging occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Due to extremely slow water recovery rates in aquitards and high
   contamination potential from sealing materials, installation of
   piezometers in aquitards for geochemical studies requires specialized
   construction and careful sampling techniques. Few methods have been
   demonstrated for obtaining representative ground crater samples for
   geochemical parameters from piezometers in aquitards, Here we implement
   and evaluate an aquitard piezometer installation and ground water
   chemistry sampling strategy and show that the use of an inert gas pocket
   in piezometer construction can be used to delay seal contamination for
   at least three years and avoid oxygenation and disturbance of downhole
   redox conditions. Major ion analyses did not change appreciably through
   the standing water columns in the aquitard piezometers over time;
   however, reliable measurements of typically unstable geochemical
   parameters (dissolved oxygen, pH, and oxidation-reduction potential)
   were best obtained using downhole, in situ instrumentation, provided
   there was at least 2 to 10 m of standing water in the piezometer.}},

Title = {{Impacts of irrigated vegetable agriculture on a humid north-central US

Abstract = {{We determined the impacts of irrigated vegetable agriculture on ground
   water quality in a 29 km(2) portion of the Wisconsin central sand plain
   (WCSP). Vegetable fields cover 22\% of the study area and are used for
   growing potatoes, sweet corn, snap beans, peas, field corn, and
   soybeans, We found that contaminant plumes from fields underlay about
   54\% of the area. Plumes were 3 to >16 m thick and in places occupied
   the entire aquifer thickness. Impacted ground water retained the
   chemical signature observed under fields, and compared with unimpacted
   ground water, had elevated NO3-N (median 13.7 mg L-1 impacted vs. 0.5
   for unimpacted) and Cl (median 23 vs. 2.0 mg L-1) and 1.4 to 2.5 times
   the Ca, Mg, K, Na, and SO4. NO3-N detections exceeded 10 mg L-1 in 58\%
   of impacted monitoring wells compared with none of the unimpacted wells.
   Evidence of denitrification was observed, but rarely, Residues of the
   pesticides alachlor, atrazine, carbofuran, metolachlor, and metribuzin
   were detected, but usually at summed concentrations of <1 mu g L-1
   outside of fields. The maximum observed sum of pesticide residues was 8
   mu g L-1. Not all potential pesticide residues were detectable by the
   analytical method.
   Agricultural impacts limit the aquifer's value as a source of potable
   water, because wells are unable to tap unimpacted ground water through
   much of the area. Results of this study are generally applicable to
   other humid sandy areas in the north-central United States and
   elsewhere, Impacts might be more severe elsewhere because the
   agricultural Land use is frequently denser and ground water flowpaths
   are longer.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the
   single-well, ``push-pull{''} test to characterize the enhanced
   solubilization of trichloroethene (TCE) by a hexadecyl diphenyl oxide
   disulfonate (DOWFAX) surfactant, Batch solubilization experiments
   indicated a linear relationship between TCE solubility and DOWFAX
   concentration characterized by weight- and molar-solubilization ratios
   of 0.26 and 1.25, respectively. Laboratory push-pull tests were
   performed in wedge-shaped physical aquifer models to simulate the
   alternating radially divergent/convergent flow field in the vicinity of
   an injection/extraction well. Experiments were conducted in a TCE-free
   sediment pack and in a sediment pack initially containing liquid TCE
   with an initial saturation of similar to 5\% of the total pore volume,
   In an experiment conducted in the absence of DOWFAX, maximum TCE
   concentrations during the extraction phase were similar to 0.6 g/L, In
   contrast, in an experiment conducted with 13.5 g/L active DOWFAX, TCE
   concentrations during the extraction phase increased to similar to 3.2
   g/L and TCE mass recovery increased by a factor of similar to 3. Two
   additional experiments conducted with DOWFAX in the same sediment pack
   yielded smaller maximum TCE concentrations and mass recoveries. The
   increased density of injected DOWFAX solutions due to TCE solubilization
   resulted in significant sinking of injected solutions and an
   accumulation bf DOWFAX and TCE at greater depths in the sediment pack;
   however no mobilization or sinking of liquid TCE was observed. The
   results indicate that push-pull tests can provide useful information on
   surfactant enhanced solubilization of nonaqueous phase liquids in the
   subsurface.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model of stream-aquifer interaction is proposed that
   considers the effects from a small degree of aquifer penetration and
   low-permeability sediments on the head response to an arbitrary
   stream-stage hydrograph. Aquifer sections under the stream and beyond
   are considered in a single model. The model of ground water flow in the
   aquifer is based on the Dupuit assumptions corrected for leakage from
   the stream. The model can use stream-stage hydrographs in both
   analytical and tabular forms. The nondimensional linear boundary value
   problem is solved for hydraulic head in the aquifer using numerical
   Laplace transforms and a convolution algorithm. The proposed solution is
   used to assess the impact of shallow penetration and low-permeability
   streambed sediments on head responses by comparison with available
   solutions which neglect these factors.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{Specific capacity (Q/s) data are usually much more abundant than
   transmissivity (T) data. Theories which assume uniform transmissivity
   predict a nearly linear relationship between T and Q/s, However, linear
   dependence is seldom observed in field studies. Since hydrogeologic
   studies usually require T data, many hydrogeologists use linear
   regression analysis of T versus Q/s data to estimate T values where only
   Q/s data are available. In this paper we use numerical models to
   investigate the effects of aquifer heterogeneity on the relationship
   between Q/s and T estimates. The simulations of hydraulic tests in
   heterogeneous media show that estimates of T derived using Jacob's
   method tend to their late-time effective value much faster than Q/s
   values. The latter are found to be more dependent upon local
   transmissivities near the web, This explains why the regression
   parameters for T versus Q/s data depend on heterogeneity and the
   `lateness' of the test period analyzed. Since this effect is more marked
   in high T zones than in low T zones, we conclude that natural aquifer
   heterogeneity can explain the convex deviation from Linearity often
   observed in the field, A further result is that the geometric mean of T
   estimates, obtained from short and intermediate time pumping tests,
   seems to systematically underestimate effective T (T-eff) of
   heterogeneous aquifers, In the studied simulation cases, the median of
   the T values or the arithmetic mean yield better estimates for T-eff.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of uranium from contaminated ground water using zero valent iron
   is currently under evaluation at several U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
   facilities. Uranium removal by zero valent iron may occur via adsorption
   onto iron corrosion products, and by reduction to less soluble valence
   states by reactions with elemental iron, This research investigated the
   effects of water chemistry and surface precipitate buildup on the
   removal of soluble uranium by zero valent iron. Batch testing was
   performed to assess solution chemistry effects on uranium adsorption to
   the potential iron corrosion products, magnetite and a mixed valent
   amorphous iron oxide. Uranium adsorption to the simulated iron corrosion
   products was highly dependent on pH, and the concentration and
   speciation of the background electrolyte solution. Uranium removal via
   reduction by elemental iron closely approximated pseudo-first-order
   removal kinetics, despite the buildup of up to 40,000 monolayers of
   precipitated uranium on the iron surfaces, This indicates that the rate
   of uranium removal is not strongly dependent on the thickness of the
   adsorbed uranium layer. Short-term rates of uranium reduction were
   similar for all solutions tested, but long-term rates were highly
   dependent on water chemistry, Compared to deionized water uranium
   removal rates were increased in sodium chloride containing solutions and
   reduced in sodium nitrate solutions. The strong influence of water
   chemistry on long-term reduction rates indicates that system design will
   require extended testing with the ground water of interest.}},

Abstract = {{A fully saturated, free-surface ground water flow model and a variably
   saturated model are applied to the solution of the free-surface ground
   water flow problem in order to determine the influence of the
   unsaturated flow component on the accuracy of the saturated flow
   solution and the water balance for homogeneous systems. The significance
   of the seepage face that must exist to provide a transition between a
   phreatic surface and a downstream surface water body is also evaluated.
   A series of simple generic cross-sectional test cases are used as the
   basis for the numerical investigations. The fully saturated and variably
   saturated models used in this study are two-dimensional Galerkin
   finite-element models that incorporate exit seepage face options. The
   fully saturated solution is found to be almost identical to the variably
   saturated solution below the water table, the only significant
   difference being that the variably saturated model predicts a slightly
   lower mater table due to horizontal flow components in the capillary
   fringe. This difference is negligible for large-scale systems, showing
   that for homogeneous systems, unsaturated flow can be neglected and
   steady-state flow including seepage face discharge can be realistically
   simulated by a fully saturated free-surface model. For aquifer-scale
   systems where discretization limitations may prevent the explicit
   representation of seepage faces, the seepage face can be omitted because
   of its negligible influence on the overall water balance at the larger
   scale.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{In 1954, Boulton proposed a delayed yield idealization to account for
   the dynamic contribution of water from the zone of desaturation during a
   pumping test in an unconfined aquifer. During the 1970s, the
   reasonableness of this idealization was questioned by some on the
   grounds that the exponential function with a constant parameter, used by
   Boulton to quantify the drainage process, was too simplistic and that
   the parameter will, in actuality, vary in time and space. Rather than
   discussing the merit of the delayed yield idealization in regard to an
   unconfined aquifer, the present work explores a different physical
   situation of an aquifer in which Boulton's idealization is realistic.
   Laboratory evidence exists to suggest that the deformation behavior of
   some aquifer materials is time dependent (creep or strain accumulation).
   In turn, this time dependence of deformation leads to a time dependence
   of the compressibility of the aquifer material, and hence, a time
   dependence of the aquifer's specific storage. In situations where the
   specific storage of an aquifer may be characterized by such time
   dependence, and if such time dependence can be reasonably approximated
   by an exponential function, then the response of such an aquifer to a
   constant rate pumping test will be described accurately by Boulton's
   mathematical formulation.}},

Title = {{Recharge estimation by stage-discharge interpolation of springflows from
   cross-correlated well measurements}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{332-337}},
Month = {{MAY-JUN}},
Abstract = {{For shallow phreatic aquifers, from which springflow is the predominant
   source of discharge, recharge volumes may be approximated as the time
   integral of springflow time series. However, field measurement of flows
   from numerous springs,,vith sufficient frequency to accurately estimate
   this time integral, is frequently impractical. A technique for
   interpolation of continuous springflow time series is presented, using
   cross-correlation between flows and continuous head measurements in
   associated wells, Suitable wells must lie within the recharge catchment
   of the spring in question and display negligible phase lag between well
   and spring response to recharge. Brief (<1 year) periods of calibration
   may be sufficient to establish calibration upon which discharge
   interpolation from well data may be based. A 7 m thick highly
   heterogeneous mine-waste aquifer, with springflows highly sensitive to
   recharge events, is examined as a test case. Over a 40 day recharge
   period, three well/spring pairs yielded acceptable cross-correlation
   across four recharge events, Head from one of these wells was compared
   to a second nearby spring and found to show poor correlation, attributed
   to its location outside of that spring's catchment. Calibration
   statistics were found to be robust when the calibration dataset for one
   pair was reduced in size. Measured flows from one of the correlated
   springs also displayed correlation with summed discharge from the
   aquifer at all measured springs, based on concurrent flow measurements
   over time. Results suggest that continuous measurements of head from a
   small number of critically selected wells may allow accurate estimates
   of transient spring discharge rates following a relatively brief period
   of flow-stage calibration. The success of the method may depend on
   specific characteristics of aquifers to which it is applied, such as
   size of spring catchments, aquifer conductance, aquifer heterogeneity,
   and spatial distribution of recharge.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water/surface water interaction in rivers is dependent on the
   hydraulic conductivity of sediments lining the streambed, This study was
   designed to determine the temporal and spatial variability of the
   hydraulic conductivity of active sedimentary deposits lining the
   streambed of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, These reattachment
   bars form aquifers and create return-current channels that are critical
   for supporting terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Monitoring wells were
   placed in five separate reattachment bars over a 200 mile long reach of
   the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam. Hydraulic conductivity was
   measured in all wells with the pneumatic slug test method. There is no
   significant difference in hydraulic conductivity among the five
   reattachment bars in the Grand Canyon. Hydraulic conductivity is
   bimodally distributed within a reattachment bar because of differing
   sizes of sediments deposited under different eddy velocities. A major
   controlled release of water from Glen Canyon Dam in March 1996
   redistributed the sediments in the reattachment bars and compressed
   sediments deposited during previous floods, Hydraulic conductivity was
   significantly lower in these sediments after the flood due to the
   increased effective stress from the newly deposited sediment. A year
   later, after the sediments had drained and some deflation had occurred,
   hydraulic conductivity of sand deposits returned to values similar to
   pre-flood values, whereas fine-grained sediments that compressed weren't
   able to elastically respond.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple calibration targets were used to calibrate a two-dimensional
   finite-difference model of a ground water lake system. The calibration
   targets included (1) steady-state head data, (2) transient head data,
   (3) head gradients, and (4) flowpath information. Because calibration
   was sensitive to the ratio of horizontal to vertical hydraulic
   conductivity, four models, each with different assumptions about
   anisotropy, were developed. All four models produced acceptable
   calibration to either heads or flowpath, but only one model was well
   calibrated to all targets. In that model, stratification of the upper
   aquifer was represented by introducing several dipping layers of low
   permeability. This allowed the use of a small ratio of horizontal to
   vertical anisotropy for individual layers but produced a large effective
   anisotropy for the upper aquifer as a whole.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical model to assess the risk of ground water pollution caused
   by leaks from surficial depositories containing water-soluble toxic
   substances is presented, The proposed model includes two stages of
   pollutant migration: (1) predominantly vertical transport through a
   low-permeability protective soil layer above the aquifer, and (2) two-
   or three-dimensional transfer of the pollutant in ground water flow
   Convection, longitudinal and transverse dispersion, sorption, and
   pollutant decay are taken into consideration both for the soil layer and
   the aquifer, Corresponding boundary problems are formulated and solved.
   The exact solutions allow us to estimate the possibility of toxic
   substance percolation into the aquifer and the expected intensity of
   this process, and to simulate pollution zone formation in ground water
   and possible material flow to a nearby surface water body, The
   calculations showed good numerical accuracy and the practical
   convenience of the model for monitoring and predicting ground water
   pollution near landfills and depositories of industrial solid waste.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate data analyses were performed with the hydrochemical data
   from a small area in Incheon, Korea. Previous studies based on
   hydrogeological and hydrochemical observations proposed that the ground
   water hydrochemical system of the site is governed by two distinct
   hydrochemical regimes. Each of the two regimes governs a ground water
   zone, zones A and B, The ground water in zone A is characterized by
   confined aquifer conditions and low values of dissolved oxygen (DO),
   NO3-, SO42-, Na+, Cl- and Mg2+, without much seasonal fluctuation in
   chemical properties. On the other hand, the ground water in zone B is
   characterized by unconfined aquifer conditions, relatively higher DO and
   NO3-, and higher, but seasonally variable, Na+ and Cl-, The
   hydrochemical data used for the interpretation of the previous studies
   are employed for factor and cluster analysis. Major factors are
   interpreted as correlates of chemical processes. Factor scores are
   computed and the cluster analysis is performed using factor scores. The
   zones discretized from the cluster analysis have the same distribution
   pattern as the zones delineated in the previous studies. The factor
   scores and the cluster analysis results also imply seasonal variation of
   the ground water hydrochemical system.}},

Abstract = {{The Channel Network model and its computer implementation, the code
   CHAN3D, are presented for simulations of fluid flow and transport of
   solutes, The tool may be used to simulate and interpret field
   experiments of flow and transport on a large or small scale. It also may
   also be used for performance and safety assessments of repositories for
   nuclear and other hazardous wastes, e.g., chemical wastes. From
   observations in the field it is deduced that the flow and transport take
   place in a three-dimensional network of connected channels. The channels
   have different properties and are generated in the model from observed
   stochastic distributions. This allows us to represent the large
   heterogeneity of the flow distribution commonly observed in the field.
   Solute transport is modeled considering advection and rock interactions
   such as matrix diffusion and sorption within the interior of the rock.
   For repository conditions the main contributions to the dispersion of
   solutes come from the large variation in the flow field (channeling) and
   the rock interactions. Objects such as fracture zones, tunnels, and
   release sources can be incorporated in the model. In addition, a
   methodology of how data may be obtained for the model is described. Data
   may be obtained from borehole and laboratory measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the importance of fluorescent dye sorption when
   selecting dyes for tracer studies, The effect of dye and media
   properties on dye sorption was evaluated using four fluorescent dyes
   (fluorescein, rhodamine B, rhodamine WT, and sulforhodamine B), two
   oppositely charged mineral surfaces (alumina and silica), and n-octanol
   (as a neutral organic phase). Fluorescein, which has only negative
   functional groups, sorbed least onto negatively charged silica but most
   onto positively charged alumina. The rhodamine dyes,,vith a permanent
   positive charge and negatively charged functional groups, sorbed onto
   both alumina and silica, Sulforhodamine B, with two strongly
   electronegative sulfonic groups, sorbed less onto negatively charged
   silica than did rhodamine WT, which has two carboxyl groups. Dye
   partitioning into n-octanol was strongly pH dependent,vith fluorescein
   being the most hydrophobic, followed by rhodamine WT and sulforhodamine
   B, Since fluorescent dyes are subject to sorption, dye selection should
   be based on their chemical properties, media characteristics, and
   laboratory batch and column studies.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding colloid transport in ground water is essential to
   assessing the migration of colloid-size contaminants, the facilitation
   of dissolved contaminant transport by colloids, in situ bioremediation,
   and the health risks of pathogen contamination in drinking water wells,
   Much has been learned through laboratory and field-scale colloid tracer
   tests, but progress has been hampered by a lack of consistent tracer
   testing methodology at different scales and fluid velocities. This paper
   presents laboratory and field tracer tests in fractured rock that use
   the same type of colloid tracer over an almost three orders-of-magnitude
   range in scale and fluid velocity Fluorescently-dyed
   carboxylate-modified latex (CML) microspheres (0.19 to 0.98 mu m
   diameter) were used as tracers in (1) a naturally fractured tuff sample,
   (2) a large block of naturally fractured granite, (3) a fractured
   granite field site, and (4) another fractured granite/schist field site.
   In all cases, the mean transport time of the microspheres was shorter
   than the solutes, regardless of detection limit. In all but the smallest
   scale test, only a fraction of the injected microsphere mass was
   recovered, with the smaller microspheres being recovered to a greater
   extent than the larger microspheres, Using existing theory, we
   hypothesize that the observed microsphere early arrival was due to
   volume exclusion and attenuation was due to aggregation and/or settling
   during transport. In most tests, microspheres were detected using flow
   cytometry, which proved to be an excellent method of analysis. CML
   microspheres appear to be useful tracers for fractured rock in forced
   gradient and short-term natural gradient tests, but longer residence
   times may result in small microsphere recoveries.}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic and geochemical performance of a 366 m long permeable
   reactive barrier (PRB) at the Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado,
   was evaluated, The funnel and gate system, which was installed in 1996
   to intercept and remediate ground water contaminated,vith chlorinated
   aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs), contained four 12.2 m wide gates filled
   with zero-valent iron, Ground water mounding on the upgradient side of
   the PRE resulted in a tenfold increase in the hydraulic gradient and
   ground water velocity through the gates compared to areas of the aquifer
   unaffected by the PRE. Water balance calculations for April 1997
   indicate that about 75\% of the ground water moving toward the PRE from
   upgradient areas moved through the gates, The rest of the water either
   accumulated on the upgradient side of the PRE or bypassed the PRE.
   Chemical data from monitoring wells screened downgradient, beneath, and
   at the ends of the PRE indicate that contaminants had not bypassed the
   PRE, except in a few isolated areas. Greater than 99\% of the CAH mass
   entering the gates was retained by the iron, Fifty-one percent of the
   CAH carbon entering one gate was accounted for in dissolved C-1 and C-2
   hydrocarbons, primarily ethane and ethene, which indicates that CAHs may
   adsorb to the iron prior to being dehalogenated. Treated water exiting
   the gates displaced contaminated ground water at a distance of at least
   3 m downgradient from the PRE by the end of 1997, Measurements of
   dissolved inorganic ions in one gate indicate that calcite and siderite
   precipitation in the gate could reduce gate porosity by about 0.35\% per
   year, Results from this study indicate that funnel and gate systems
   containing zero-valent iron can effectively treat ground water
   contaminated with CAHs, However, the hydrologic impacts of the PRE on
   the flow system need to be fully understood to prevent contaminants from
   bypassing the PRB.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of caffeine or human pharmaceuticals in ground water with
   elevated nitrate concentrations can provide a clear, unambiguous
   indication that domestic waste water is a source of some of the nitrate.
   Water from domestic, public supply, and monitoring wells in three
   communities near Reno, Nevada, was sampled to test if caffeine or
   pharmaceuticals are common, persistent, and mobile enough in the
   environment that they can be detected in nitrate-contaminated ground
   water and, thus, can be useful indicators of recharge from domestic
   waste water. Results of this study indicate that these compounds can be
   used as indicators of recharge from domestic waste water, although their
   usefulness is limited because caffeine is apparently nonconservative and
   the presence of prescription pharmaceuticals is unpredictable. The
   absence of caffeine or pharmaceuticals in ground water with elevated
   nitrate concentrations does not demonstrate that the aquifer is free of
   waste water contamination, Caffeine was detected in ground water samples
   at concentrations up to 0.23 mu g/L, The human pharmaceuticals
   chlorpropamide, phensuximide, and carbamazepine also were detected in
   some samples.}},

Abstract = {{Seepage meters provide a useful, inexpensive method of measuring seepage

   coarse sand and water to a depth of 10 cm, Four seepage meters and two
   bag types (balloon and condom) were used in the seepage measurements.
   There was no significant difference between the seepage measurements
   obtained from the two bag types. A two-sample t-test (df=56, Wt-sat=258,
   alpha=0.01, p=0.0013) failed to reject the null hypothesis of similarity

Abstract = {{The carbonate aquifer of the Pinchinade graben, which has a
   well-delimited geometry, involves water,vith well-defined chemical types
   from calcium sulfate to magnesium bicarbonate. Each ground water type
   corresponds to a well-delimited area of the aquifer: the magnesium
   bicarbonate for the Liassic and Rhetian limestone water (with 10 to 30
   mg L-1 of sulfate) and calcium sulfate for the water of the relatively
   impermeable layer of the underlying Keuper (with 300 to 1500 mg L-1 of
   sulfate). A four-year pumping test,vith a bimonthly to daily monitoring
   of water chemistry has allowed evaluation of the renewal of the
   exploitable water reserve. During the four-year period, the survey shows
   that the average discharge is balanced by natural recharge (2.8 to 105
   m(3) y(-1)). A change in the chemical character of the water was
   observed from Rhetian to Keuper type (from 35 to 167 mg L-1 of sulfate),
   Such a change indicates a progressive exhaustion of the Rhetian
   reserves, which are the greater part of the exploitable reserve in the
   area. The same phenomenon is observed daily depending on the pumped
   discharge and the season. For pumping rates below 26 m(3) h(-1), the
   borehole drains the Rehetian inflows to a degree depending on high or
   low water levels. For pumping rates above 26 m(3) h(-1), whatever the
   period, the permeable Keuper layers are pumped and sulfate peaks ensue.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a model code to simulate a watershed's hydrology and the
   hydraulic response of an interconnected stream-aquifer system, and
   applied the model code to the Lower Republican River Basin in Kansas.
   The model code links two well-known computer programs: MODFLOW (modular
   3-D flow model), which simulates ground water flow and stream-aquifer
   interaction; and SWAT (soil water assessment tool), a soil water budget
   simulator for an agricultural watershed. SWAT represents a basin as a
   collection of subbasins in terms of soil, land use, and weather data,
   and simulates each subbasin on a daily basis to determine runoff,
   percolation, evaporation, irrigation, pond seepage, and crop growth.
   Because SWAT applies a lumped hydrologic model to each subbasin, spatial
   heterogeneities with respect to factors such as soil type and land use
   are not resolved geographically, but can instead be represented
   statistically. For the Republican River Basin model, each combination of
   six soil types and three land uses, referred to as a hydrologic response
   unit (HRU), was simulated with a separate execution of SWAT. A spatially
   weighted average was then taken over these results for each hydrologic
   flux and time step by a separate program, SWBAVG. We wrote a package for
   MODFLOW to associate each subbasin with a subset of aquifer grid cells
   and stream reaches, and to distribute the hydrologic fluxes given for
   each subbasin by SWAT and SWBAVG over MODFLOW's stream-aquifer grid to
   represent tributary flow, surface and ground water diversions, ground
   water recharge, and evapotranspiration from ground water. The Lower
   Republican River Basin model was calibrated with respect to measured
   ground water levels, streamflow and reported irrigation water use. The
   model was used to examine the relative contributions of stream yield
   components and the impact on stream yield and base flow of
   administrative measures to restrict irrigation water use during
   droughts. Model results indicate that tributary flow is the dominant
   component of stream yield and that reduction of irrigation water use
   produces a corresponding increase in base flow and stream yield.
   However, the increase in stream yield resulting from reduced water use
   does not appear to be of sufficient magnitude to restore minimum
   desirable streamflows.}},

Abstract = {{Passive vapor extraction involves wells that are screened in the
   unsaturated zone and open to the atmosphere. Gas will flow out of the
   subsurface through the open well during periods of low barometric
   pressure. Field and modeling studies have been completed to evaluate
   enhancements for a passive vapor extraction system at a site
   contaminated with carbon tetrachloride on the Hanford nuclear
   reservation near Richland, Washington. During a 38-hour period of low
   barometric pressure, approximately 500 m(3) of air were vented from the
   subsurface. Approximately 27 grams of carbon tetrachloride were removed
   from the subsurface during this same outflow event. On an annual basis,
   more than 15 kilograms of carbon tetrachloride have been removed from
   each of several passive extraction wells. Computer simulations based on
   the field data indicate that surface covers smaller than 30 m radius
   will result in relatively small enhancements of flow. However, with
   larger surface seals (i.e., up to 90 m radius), volumetric flow rates
   more than doubled. Simulations showed that cheek valves might increase
   the rate at which subsurface gases are extracted by a factor of nearly
   three. These estimates are sensitive to dispersion coefficients. If not
   properly designed, filters used to treat effluent gases from passive
   extraction systems can significantly reduce the effectiveness of these
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{Normally, slug test measurements are limited to the well in which the
   water level is perturbed. Consequently, it is often difficult to obtain
   reliable estimates of hydraulic properties, particularly if the aquifer
   is anisotropic or if there is a wellbore skin. In this investigation, we
   use partially penetrating stress and observation wells to evaluate
   specific storage, radial hydraulic conductivity and anisotropy of the
   aquifer, and the hydraulic conductivity of the borehole skin, The study
   site is located in the W9 subbasin of the Sleepers River Research
   Watershed, Vermont. At the site, similar to 3 m of saturated till are
   partially penetrated by a stress well located in the center of the
   unconfined aquifer and six observation wells located above, below and at
   the depth of the stress well at radial distances of 1.2 and 2.4 m, The
   observation wells were shut in with inflatable packers.
   The semianalytical solution of Butler (1995) was used to conduct a
   sensitivity analysis and to interpret slug test results. The sensitivity
   analysis indicates that the response of the stress well is primarily
   sensitive to radial hydraulic conductivity, less sensitiive to
   anisotropy and the conductivity of the borehole skin, and nearly
   insensitive to specific storage. In contrast, the responses of the
   observation wells are sensitive to all four parameters. Interpretation
   of the field data was facilitated by generating type curves in a manner
   analogous to the method of Cooper et al, (1967), Because the value of
   radial hydraulic conductivty is obtained from a match point, the number
   of unknowns is reduced to three. The estimated values of radial
   hydraulic conductivity and specific storage are comparable to those
   derived from the methods of Bouwer and Rice (1976) and Cooper et al,
   (1967), The values and skin conductivity, however, could not have been
   obtained without the use of observation wells.}},

Abstract = {{During the last 40 years, nitrate (NO3-) has become one of the most
   common ground water contaminants, Stream riparian zones are considered
   important ecological ecotones that decrease the NO3- load of ground
   water discharging into streams. This study uses NO3-/Cl- ratios, natural
   abundances of N-15 and O-18 in NO3-, and an in situ (NO3-)-N-15 tracer
   experiment to evaluate NO3- reducing processes occurring in ground water
   within a narrow grassed buffer strip bordering a stream in an
   agricultural watershed. The NO3-/Cl- ratios (1.9-0.0 {[}M/M]) indicate
   that both NO3- consuming processes and mixing of two ground water flow
   regimes with different NO3- loads contribute to the drop observed in
   ground water NO3- concentrations within the riparian zone. delta(15)N
   and delta(18)O of the ground water NO3- within the riparian zone
   (delta(15)N = 5.1 to 48.8 parts per thousand; delta(18)O = 1.1 to 17.8
   parts per thousand) were enriched compared to the ground water below the
   adjacent cultivated field (delta(15)N = 3.8 to 10.1 parts per thousand;
   delta(18)O = 0.5 to 6.2 parts per thousand). A significant linear
   relationship (r(2) = 0.97) between ground water delta(15)N and
   delta(18)O in NO3- was found, which is consistent with NO3- consumption
   by microbial denitrification, The estimated enrichment factors for N-15
   are a factor of 1.5 higher than for O-18. The in situ (NO3-)-N-15 tracer
   experiment conclusively confirmed that denitrification is occurring
   within the ground water of the riparian zone and demonstrates that
   denitrification rates can be directly measured in situ.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial interpolation of transmissivity and other hydrogeological
   parameters, based on data measured or observed at well locations, is
   necessary for the numerical simulation of various ground water flow and
   transport problems, The application of artificial neural network
   technology for this purpose has been investigated for the transmissivity
   of the Dammam Formation Aquifer in Kuwait. It has been found that
   reasonable estimates of this parameter can be obtained with the help of
   a network that uses the location coordinates, altitude of the top of the
   Dammam Formation, and logarithm of the total dissolved solids content of
   the ground water of the aquifer as the input neurons, and the logarithm
   of the transmissivity value as the output neuron. A better estimate is
   obtained with a model that takes into account the information on the
   occurrence of circulation loss in the Dammam Formation. This
   information, however, can only be obtained at a site where a well has
   penetrated the Dammam Formation, and unlike the altitude of a
   stratigraphic horizon and total dissolved solids content, cannot be
   extrapolated with any certainty away from a well site. This model,
   therefore, has limited value in estimating the transmissivity of the
   Dammam Formation. The artificial neural network models are found to give
   better estimates of transmissivity of the Dammam Formation in Kuwait
   when compared with the more commonly used kriging model.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation of pumping tests in multilayer wells with

Abstract = {{An important feature of pumping in a multilayer system is the dynamic
   interaction between the aquifers via non-Darcian vertical flow within
   the wellbore, An equivalent hydraulic conductivity (EHC) approach is
   used to include this transient interaction as a special leakage through
   the confining layer in the flow system. Different flow regimes (laminar
   and turbulent flows, and the transition range) are involved in a
   multilayer pumping test where the relation between the hydraulic
   gradient and flow velocity is complicated. The change of flow regimes is
   accommodated by varying the content of EHC as a function of the friction
   factor. For a particular well, the relation between friction factor and
   Reynolds number is unique and is obtained by interpolating Nikuradse's
   experimental results. A quasi-three-dimensional Galerkin finite-element
   method is used to integrate the vertical one-dimensional now in the
   wellbore and confining layers and the two-dimensional flow in the
   aquifers, This approach makes it possible to couple the aquifer and
   wellbore flows of different flow regimes and to salve them in a single
   numerical framework based on the same linear relation between gradient
   and velocity. A carefully designed pumping test in a multilayer aquifer
   system near Beihai City, Guangxi Autonomous Region, China, is used to
   demonstrate the performance of the approach.}},

   Laplace transform solution (Moench 1996) for flow to a web in a water
   table aquifer, Some improvements are suggested to increase the speed of
   computation, especially for low beta values. The first is to calculate
   the type curves at points which are spaced a factor of two apart, thus
   allowing more efficient use of the Stehfest inversion algorithm. An
   improved numerical method to determine the roots of the equation xtanx =
   alpha is suggested. Finally, more efficient determination of the number
   of terms in the required series summation may lead to significant
   reduction in computing time.}},

Abstract = {{Surface refraction seismic surveys were conducted within a 7.3 km(2)
   east-central Pennsylvania watershed to characterize the geometry of its
   shallow layered and fractured bedrock, These data were augmented with
   observations from 29 rock cores, Hydraulic conductivity (K) of the
   bedrock was determined by interval packer testing within the boreholes.
   Finally, the MODFLOW ground water model was applied to the layered
   aquifer geometry in a three-dimensional format to determine
   watershed-scale aquifer parameters by model calibration to observed
   watershed data. Seismic testing showed that the aquifer could be
   characterized by four distinct layers, each with its own characteristic
   seismic velocity Hydraulic conductivity determined by field testing
   decreased with depth, ranging from greater than 1.0 m day(-1) in the
   shallow, highly fractured layer to approximately 0.01 m day(-1) in the
   regional aquifer, Its distribution with depth reflected the increase in
   seismic velocities and decrease in extent of fracturing observed in the
   cores. Aquifer geometry determined from seismic testing and rock cores
   was used to define model layer geometry, and K values from model
   calibration compared favorably to those determined by field testing. The
   ground water model was also used in calibration mode to determine
   specific yields (S-y) of the characteristic fracture layers, These were
   all low, ranging from 0.005 in the highly fractured layer to 0.0001 in
   the regional aquifer. When aquifer geometry determined from detailed
   seismic surveys is used as the basis for watershed-scale ground water
   modeling in these shallow layered and fractured systems, hydraulic
   parameters derived by field testing compare well to those determined by
   model calibration.}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional probabilistic transport model is developed by coupling
   a reliability algorithm to a two-dimensional unsaturated flow and
   transport model, The goal is to determine the significance of the
   uncertainty of each variable to the probability outcome, Model input
   includes the mean, standard deviation, and probability distribution of
   each uncertain variable. The uncertain variables are assumed to be
   uncorrelated to each other. The uncertain variables are saturated water
   content, residual mater content, van Genuchten model parameters alpha
   (a) and n, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, coefficient
   of distribution, molecular diffusion coefficient, and dispersivity,
   Coefficient of variation is used as the measure of uncertainty for each
   uncertain variable. Three soil samples are considered for model
   simulations. One half of the flow surface area is the source of a
   generic contaminant spill. The reliability analysis determines the
   probability of exceeding a specific target concentration value and also
   provides a sensitivity value that measures the relative significance of
   each uncertain transport variable to the probability outcome, Generally,
   saturated water content tends to be the most significant uncertain
   variable for transport in the unsaturated zone. Bulk density and
   coefficient of distribution also are significant for reactive transport.
   Molecular diffusion and van Genuchten model parameter n are significant
   in fine-grained soils and also at locations far from the contaminant
   source area. The uncertainty of saturated hydraulic conductivity and
   dispersivity have no significant influence on the probability outcome
   and can be considered as deterministic input variables.}},

Abstract = {{The principal bedrock aquifer system across much of Indiana consists of
   carbonate rocks of Silurian and Devonian age. The Silurian-Devonian
   aquifer system is used extensively for irrigation in northwestern
   Indiana and is approximately 170 m thick. Reef and nonreef carbonate
   aquifers in northwestern Indiana were assessed using hydrogeology
   (lithology, geophysical logs, aquifer tests) and geochemistry (major
   ions and stable isotopes).
   The study showed differences in water quantity and quality between the
   reef and nonreef aquifers. The reef aquifer had few shales, abundant
   fossiliferous material (up to 100 m thick), and high porosities (10 to
   15\%). The nonreef aquifer had abundant shales, less fossiliferons
   material (a few meters thick), and low porosities. Total
   transmissivities at the reef sites were 697 m(2)/d, (meters squared per
   day) and 4831 m(2)/d, compared to 46 m(2)/d at the nonreef site.
   Flowpaths in the nonreef aquifer were associated with fractures and
   poorly connected moldic porosity with larger fractures and better
   connected vuggy porosity in the reef aquifer. Water chemistry data for
   the nonreef aquifer showed mean concentrations of sodium (235 mg/L
   {[}milligrams per liter]), sulfate (160 mg/L), sulfide (13 mg/L),
   fluoride (2.7 mg/L), and dissolved solids (635 mg/L) approximately two
   to five times larger when compared to mean concentrations in the reef
   aquifer. Ground water at the nonreef site was classified as a
   sodium-bicarbonate type while that at the reef sites was
   calcium-magnesium bicarbonate. The oxygen/deuterium isotope data
   indicates recharge from modern precipitation and not Pleistocene-age
   recharge.}},

Abstract = {{A framework for ground water protection was developed and tested in the
   Eastern subarea of the Managua, Nicaragua, ground water system. The
   framework is a planning tool aimed at identifying areas with a high need
   for protection to aid future land-use decisions. The basic components of
   the framework are vulnerability assessment, contaminant source
   characterization, and assignment of a protection value. The framework is
   developed for a geographic information system environment. The
   vulnerability assessment was carried out using a modified version of the
   DRASTIC method. The most vulnerable parts of the study area proved to be
   an area with a shallow ground water table coupled with
   shrinking/swelling clay soils, and an area where recent porous lava hows
   mean high recharge and tow attenuation capacity. Zn the contaminant
   sources characterization, the type of contaminant, its relative
   concentration, mode of deposition, duration of contaminant load, and
   possibility for remediation were considered. The sources characterized
   as emitting a high potential contamination load were concentrated in a
   tax-free industrial zone and three villages. The main contaminant
   sources were a tannery, chemical industries, and sewage water outlets.
   Both the ground water vulnerability and the potential contamination load
   were classified as high, moderate, or low By superimposing the potential
   contamination load on the vulnerability. map, the ground water
   contamination liability was evaluated by a skewed 3 x 3 matrix, A
   relative protection value of the ground water was calculated, based on
   classifications of available quantities, quality, sensitivity to changes
   in ground water level, and present or planned use. Together, these maps
   form an atlas to be used for ground water protection and landuse
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{A management model is developed to determine optimal mater allocation
   policies for hydraulically connected time-variant surface and ground
   water supplies in a hypothetical system. The system involves a
   multipurpose reservoir, a hydraulically connected stream and aquifer,
   agricultural plots, water supply and observation wells, and an
   artificial recharge zone. The model minimizes deviations from a set of
   rule curves defined for storage in the reservoir and along the stream
   course, so as to consider possibilities for storage of excess water in
   wet periods and its distribution in subsequent dry periods. The
   hypothetical system is divided into components which are subsequently
   integrated using numerically generated response functions that relate
   the systemis behavior to various system excitations. The management
   model is formulated and solved for monthly time steps, which include
   both dry and wet conditions, to determine reservoir release, pumpage
   rate from supply wells, artificial recharge rate, water diversion from
   reservoir and stream to the demand area, and storage both in the
   reservoir and along the stream course at an optimal level in each time
   step over a six-month planning horizon. Furthermore, sensitivity
   analysis of the management plan with respect to potential use of ground
   water supplies is performed to analyze the latter's impact on operating
   policies.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrations of a radiotracer were measured continuously in
   observation wells in a field test conducted in the sandy aquifer at the
   Chalk River site. These measurements were used recently (Dagan et al,
   1997) to assess the values of the parameters characterizing the spatial
   distribution of logconductivity (mean, variance, and horizontal and
   vertical integral scales).
   Soil samples were taken independently from a few wells and the
   grain-size distributions were determined by sieve analysis. The aim of
   the present study is to infer the aforementioned parameters' values of
   logconductivity with the aid of grain-size distributions. A
   Carman-Kozeny-type formula was used to derive the sample hydraulic
   conductivity and a geostatistical analysis to infer the parameters
   characterizing the logconductivity spatial distribution. The agreement
   for the results based on the two methods was quite satisfactory in view
   of the various approximations adopted by the two methodologies.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of two well-characterized, oxidizing septic system
   plumes (Langton and Long Point 2 sites) over periods extending two to
   four gears after decommissioning, has revealed that ground water POP
   concentrations (0.4 to 5 mg/L P) have persisted at levels virtually
   unchanged from those observed during active sewage loading. In addition,
   the frontal part of the PO43- plume at the Long Point 2 site can be
   observed to continue to advance during the decommissioned period. At the
   Langton site, where an active regional ground water flow system is
   present, all major plume solutes (Na+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-) returned to
   background values within one year of decommissioning, with the exception
   of PO43-.
   This evidence suggests that phosphate behavior in the ground mater zone
   at these sites is dominated by sorption reactions that are both rapid
   and reversible. Thus, if septic system phosphorus is not retained in the
   vadose zone, but is transported into the ground water zone, it has the
   potential to be persistent and to be mobile enough to constitute a
   threat to downgradient surface mater environments. This evidence also
   shows that when a septic system is decommissioned, if an oxidizing PO43-
   plume is present, downgradient P loading is not likely to diminish for
   many years thereafter.}},

Abstract = {{The capillary pressure versus saturation relationship for various
   carbonate rocks exhibits a wide range of entry pressures depending on
   the depositional and diagenetic environment of the rock. The results of
   a numerical study are presented that focus on the effect of the DNAPL
   entry pressure of the porous rock matrix on the migration of DNAPL
   within the fracture network of carbonate rocks. Representative numerical
   experiments involving the release of DNAPL into a single vertical
   fracture terminating within a porous carbonate rock that was assigned a
   variety of measured capillary pressure versus saturation relationships
   showed that the volume of DNAPL that entered the rock matrix increased
   dramatically as the entry pressure of the rock matrix decreased.
   Simulations of a DNAPL-contaminated site located on fractured carbonate
   bedrock in southern Ontario are also presented which highlight the
   sensitivity of the extent of the zone of DNAPL contamination within the
   bedrock to the capillary pressure curves assigned to the rock matrix.
   One scenario presented demonstrates that the penetration depth and
   horizontal extent of the zone of DNAPL contamination within the bedrock
   can be large if the carbonate rock has a high entry pressure, because
   much of the DNAPL Bow is restricted to the fracture network. Another
   case involving a lower entry pressure for the rock matrix produced a
   smaller zone of DNAPL contamination, but the bulk of the DNAPL was
   contained in the rock matrix. The results for both cases suggest that
   attempts at DNAPL-zone restoration in fractured rock using technologies
   that are available today would be problematic.}},

Title = {{Post audit of a numerical prediction of wellfield drawdown in a

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{A numerical ground water pow model was created in 1978 and revised in
   1981 to predict the drawdown effects of a proposed municipal wellfield
   permitted to withdraw 30 million gallons per day (mgd; 1.1 X 10(5)
   m(3)/day) of water from the semiconfined Floridan Aquifer system. The
   predictions are based on the assumption that water levels in the
   semiconfined Floridan Aquifer reach a longterm, steady-state condition
   within a few days of initiation of pumping. Using this assumption, a 75
   day simulation without water table recharge, pumping at the maximum
   permitted rates, was considered to represent a worst-case condition and
   the greatest drawdowns that could be experienced during wellfield
   operation. This method of predicting wellfield effects was accepted by
   the permitting agency.
   For this post audit, observed drawdowns were derived by taking the
   difference between pre-pumping and post-pumping potentiometric surface
   levels. Comparison of predicted and observed drawdowns suggests that
   actual drawdown over a 12 year period exceeds predicted drawdown by a
   factor of two or more. Analysis of the source of error in the 1981
   predictions suggests that the values used for transmissivity
   storativity, specific yield, and leakance are reasonable at the
   wellfield scale. Simulation using actual 1980-1992 pumping rates
   improves the agreement between predicted and observed drawdowns. The
   principal source of error is the assumption that water levels in a
   semiconfined aquifer achieve a steady-state condition after a few days
   or weeks of pumping. Simulations using a version of the 1981 model
   modified to include recharge and evapotranspiration suggest that it can
   take hundreds of days or several years for water levels in the linked
   Surficial and Floridan Aquifers to reach an apparent steady-state
   condition, and that slow declines in levels continue for years after the
   initiation of pumping. While the 1981 ``impact{''} model can be used for
   reasonably predicting short-term, wellfield-scale effects of pumping,
   using a 75 day long simulation without recharge to predict the long-term
   behavior of the wellfield was an inappropriate application, resulting in
   significant underprediction of wellfield effects.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of solute travel distance based on homogeneous and isotropic
   hydraulic conductivity may lead to substantial differences in the actual
   travel distance in a heterogeneous system. The effect of randomly
   varying hydraulic conductivity on the spatial location of time-related
   well capture zones for a nonreactive tracer in a confined aquifer with
   uniform base flow is considered. A numerical Monte Carlo procedure is
   used in conjunction with fast Fourier transform-based spectral methods.
   The log hydraulic conductivity field is assumed to be Gaussian and
   stationary, with isotropic exponential autocovariance. Various degrees
   of domain heterogeneity are considered, and stability and accuracy of
   the numerical procedure are examined. The total probability that a
   particle injected at a point in the aquifer is extracted by the well
   within a given time is identified, The concept of probabilistic
   isochrone, which is the boundary of a given time-related capture zone,
   is introduced. A simple analytical model that extends the deterministic
   capture-zone model for uniform media is derived, by taking into account
   the effect of random variations of hydraulic conductivity. Knowledge of
   the spatial pattern of probabilistic isochrones allows reconstructing
   the breakthrough curve at the well for solute injections at selected
   locations in the aquifer.}},

Title = {{Ground water salinization caused by residual neogene and pliocene sea
   water - An example from the Judea group aquifer, southern Israel}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{The Judea Group Aquifer of late Albian-Turonian age is mainly composed
   of karstic limestone and dolomite. In the western part of Israel it is
   known as the Yarkon-Taninim ground water basin. The study area is
   located in the southern part of the basin. Fresh ground water (46 to 200
   mg/L Cl) flows northward from the south and southeast, Saline ground
   water (1200 to 8350 mg/L Cl), which occurs irregularly in the midst of
   this flowpath, severely jeopardizes the development and exploitation of
   this aquifer. By defining the hydrochemical typology and applying mass
   balance considerations, it was found that the saline mater is derived
   from two endmembers designated as the ``Lahish{''} and ``Hazerim{''}
   water types. The Lahish water type is generally responsible for
   salinization of the lower portion of the Judea Group Aquifer, It
   apparently evolved from transgressing Messinian sea water which
   penetrated inland through prior incised Neogene erosional channels. Upon
   inundation, it dissolved halite and gypsum from the Mavqi'im Formation,
   This was followed by massive bacterial reduction of sulfates in the
   presence of oil. The Hazerim water type infiltrated into the Judea Group
   Aquifer through the overlying Avedat and Mt. Scopus rock successions. It
   appears that the Hazerim water developed from the transgressing Pliocene
   sea which percolated through these low-permeability rock units.
   Subsequent rain percolated through these formations, dissolved
   evaporites that are mainly concentrated in the shallow layers and mixed
   with residual sea water of Pliocene age, which became more diluted over
   time. Geological studies revealed that during the Neogene age, the
   back-cut incision of channels into the Coastal plain facilitated inland
   ingression of the sea and dissolution of evaporites. The Pliocene marine
   transgression deposited a thick sequence of clay that sealed the
   underlying beds, This process resulted in trapping and pressurizing the
   saline water landward along pre-existing fault lines. These findings
   contribute to the formulation of an updated ground water exploitation
   scheme that avoids subsurface fault systems, which act as conduits of
   brines. The geological processes occurred during the Neogene and
   Pliocene. This case study could help solve similar problems in the
   eastern Mediterranean region which experienced similar geological
   events.}},

Abstract = {{In regions where ground water flow is restricted to sparse, narrow
   fractures, productive and nonproductive drilling sites frequently are
   separated by only a few tens of meters. Drilling success rates are low
   in these areas because favorable drilling sites occur infrequently and
   are difficult to identify. The drilling success rate can be increased
   when imagery and surface geophysics are incorporated into the site
   selection method. We present a method to evaluate the economic benefit
   of various site selection methods and show that the use of surface
   geophysics and aerial photography can reduce drilling costs by
   approximately a factor of two in an area with a low drilling success
   rate that is characterized by narrow fracture zones covered with several
   meters of weathered clays and thick vegetation. The benefits are smaller
   and less certain when social considerations are a strong factor in site
   selection.}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American
   Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) provide guidance for selecting
   statistical procedures for ground water detection monitoring at Resource
   Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) solid and hazardous waste
   facilities, The procedures recommended for dealing with large numbers of
   nondetects, as may often be found in data for volatile organic compounds
   (VOCs), include, but are not limited to, Poisson prediction limits (in
   both the EPA guidance and ASTM standard) and Poisson tolerance limits
   (EPA guidance only). However, many of the proposed applications of the
   Poisson model are inappropriate. The development and application of the
   Poisson-based methods are explored for two types of data, counts of
   analytical hits and actual concentration measurements, Each of these two
   applications is explored along two lines of reasoning, a
   first-principles argument and a simple empirical fit.
   The application of Poisson-based methods to counts of analytical hits,
   including simultaneous consideration of multiple VOCs, appears to have
   merit from both a first principles and an empirical standpoint. On the
   other hand, the Poisson distribution is not appropriate for modeling
   concentration data, primarily because the variance of the distribution
   does not scale appropriately with changing units of measurement.
   Tolerance and prediction limits based on the Poisson distribution are
   not scale invariant, By changing the units of observation in example
   problems drawn from EPA guidance, use of the Poisson-based tolerance and
   prediction limits can result in significant errors. In short, neither
   the Poisson distribution nor associated tolerance or prediction limits
   should be used with concentration data. EPA guidance does present,
   however other, more appropriate, methods for dealing with concentration
   data in which the number of nondetects is large. These include
   nonparametric tolerance and prediction limits and a test of proportions
   based on the binomial distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A semiarid region of western Botswana, the Ghanzi-Makunda area, is the
   focus of a study to determine the relationship between lineaments and
   well yield. This relationship is inferred from geologic maps, aerial
   photographs, and Landsat TM (thematic mapper) images in conjunction with
   a well yield map produced using indicator kriging and based on 226
   globally positioned wells. A composite image of Landsat TM, digital well
   yield, lineament trace, and well location data, formed using a
   raster-based geographic information systems (GIS) technique, visually
   identifies a correlation between well yield, lineament density, and
   darker tones on Landsat TM images. Higher fracture densities correlate
   positively with higher well yields, Regression analysis identifies a
   statistically significant correlation between distance to lineament
   intersections and median well yield.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the cities southeast of Buenos Aires, Argentina, depend heavily
   on ground water for water supply. Whereas ground water quality is
   generally good in the region, economic development along the coastal
   plain has been constrained by high salinities.
   Fifty-four webs were sampled for major ions in zones of recharge,
   transport and discharge in an area near La Plata, 50 km southeast of
   Buenos Aires. The shallow, southwest to northeast coastal now system is
   >30 inn long but is only 50 to 80 m thick. It consists of
   Plio-Pleistocene fluvial sand overlain by Pleistocene eolian and fluvial
   silt and Holocene estuarine silty clay.
   Hydrochemical endmembers include HCO3, SO4, and Cl water.
   Bicarbonate-type water includes high plain recharge water (Ca-Na-HCO3)
   that evolves through cation exchange and calcite dissolution to a high
   pH, pure Na-HCO3 endmember at the southwest edge of the coastal plain,
   Similar Na-HCO3 water is also found underlying recharge areas of the
   central coastal plain, and a lens of Ca-HCO3 water is associated with a
   ridge of shell debris parallel to the coast.
   Mixed cation-Cl water near the coastline represents intruded sea water
   that has undergone cation exchange. Chemically similar water underlying
   the southwest coastal plain, however, can be shown isotopically to have
   formed from fairly dilute solutions concentrated many times by
   evapotranspiration.
   In the central coastal plain, Na-SO4-Cl water (up to 17,000 mg/L SO4)
   underlies hummocks and, at depth, forms plumes in the subsurface. The
   chemical controls are dissolution of gypsum precipitated during pyrite
   oxidation, evapotranspiration, and calcite precipitation.
   This extreme diversity of water chemistry in a shallow, elastic now
   system is uncommon. It is made possible by (1) the presence of oxidized,
   originally pyritic, but slightly permeable sediments that have been
   exposed to evolving geochemical and hydrodynamic conditions, and (2)
   highly focused recharge that favors the development of fresh water
   bodies underlying recharge zones and stagnant, evaporated water
   underlying other areas.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of electromagnetic induction as a reconnaissance technique to

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{296-304}},

Abstract = {{The use of apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured with
   electromagnetic (EM) induction was examined as a reconnaissance toot.
   for characterizing unsaturated flow in a semiarid region in the
   Chihuahuan Desert of Texas. Aboveground conductivity meters (EM31 and
   EM38) were used to measure ECa along transects in various geomorphic
   settings. Eight boreholes were drilled at different locations along the
   transects, and a downhole conductivity meter (EM39) was used to measure
   ECa. Samples were collected for analysis of clay, water, and chloride
   content to evaluate factors affecting spatial variability in ECa.
   Variations in ECa measured with the aboveground EM31 meter were affected
   by variations in day content in a playa/interplaya setting, water
   content in a fissure, and chloride content adjacent to a drainage
   system. These factors affecting ECa were confirmed by comparing ECa
   measured with the downhole EM39 meter and clay, water and chloride
   content of soil samples from boreholes. The hydrologic significance of
   parameters controlling ECa was evaluated. Variations in clay content are
   not hydrologically significant in this basin. High correlations between
   ECa and water content are difficult to interpret because in some areas
   water content variations simply reflect variations in clay content, as
   in the playa/interplaya setting, whereas in other areas higher water
   contents reflect higher water flux, as in the fissure. In some areas
   water content was below threshold values; therefore, ECa did not respond
   to water content or salinity in these areas. Although EM induction atone
   cannot distinguish causes of ECa changes, it provides a valuable tool
   for delineating variations in ECa that can be used to guide borehole
   locations and to provide valuable information for interpolating and
   extrapolating from point estimates provided by borehole data.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have suggested that head losses associated with the
   application of the electromagnetic borehole flowmeter (EBF) can have
   important and detrimental effects on the use of the instrument for
   measurement of hydraulic conductivity (K) profiles. Head losses
   associated with now through the meter may cause bypass flow around the
   packer if the well is gravel packed. In any type of well, changing head
   losses with meter position can cause changes in flow into the well that
   are not related directly to the K distribution. Such flow changes, or
   redistribution, can cause errors in the calculation of the K profile.
   Numerical simulations, based on measured head losses, indicate that
   bypass now in gravel packed systems increases with increasing flow rate
   through the meter, increasing gravel pack conductivity, and increasing
   gravel pack thickness. Ideally, the EBF should not be used in gravel
   packed wells, due to the occurrence of bypass flow.
   Investigations into the flow redistribution phenomenon indicate that the
   top portion of the aquifer is where the greatest overestimation of K
   occurs. The portion of the well below the flowmeter is isolated from the
   observed drawdown as measured from the surface. In this region, the well
   experiences a reduced drawdown, which differs from the observed drawdown
   by an amount equal to the head loss at that meter position. Flow
   redistribution causes a more pronounced effect in more highly conductive
   mediums and may be almost negligible in mediums of low conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{A spatial stochastic approach was adopted to estimate the capture zones
   of a wellfield in eastern Netherlands near the town of Wierden. The main
   sources of uncertainty were found to be the hydraulic conductivity of
   the production aquifer and the spatial distribution and thickness of an
   impeding clay layer situated above the production aquifer, Both were
   modeled as random space functions and a Monte Carlo analysis was
   performed to assess the probability distributions of the capture zones
   for t = 25 years and t --> infinity. The distributions were compared
   with two deterministic capture zones to show how the stochastic approach
   preserves the discontinuous character of the impeding clay layer while
   the deterministic approach smooths out the discontinuities. Furthermore,
   it is shown how the stochastic approach reveals the uncertainty about
   the location of the capture zones while the deterministic approach
   obscures it.}},

Abstract = {{Scale-dependent dispersion is a phenomenon that manifests as an increase
   in the magnitude of the dispersion parameters with the distance of
   travel, or the time after the spill. This implies that contaminant
   plumes occupy a larger portion of the aquifer at later times than that
   predicted by the traditional convection-dispersion models. Although it
   is an area of active research, scale-dependent ground water pollution
   modeling is now available through the practical application of a new
   hydrologic theory of dispersion, The KYSPILL software was developed as
   an application of this theory, KYSPILL provides an easy way to simulate
   and graph the movement of contaminant plumes in heterogeneous soils and
   aquifers, It has self-supported menus and windows that allow the
   selection of the type of spill, the input of hydrogeologic data, and the
   plotting of contours and breakthrough curves. It simulates biological or
   radioactive decay, adsorption, point or nonpoint sources in the
   unsaturated zone and subsequently in the saturated zone. An automatic
   self-diagnosis system tests every input data, and an on-line,
   context-sensitive, help system aids the user in the input data and
   running phases, KYSPILL is a simple tool for those chemical spills with
   little or uncertain data. It may be used for preliminary forecasting,
   monitoring planning, or remedial actions.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-37}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{In an effort to enhance the usefulness of neutron logging for
   environmental applications, a new combination of backfill and casing
   materials for access boreholes has been developed, The combination of
   acrylic casing and polyurethane foam backfill has been tested under
   laboratory and field conditions. Acrylic casing does not significantly
   attenuate fluxes of either high energy or thermal neutrons, in contrast
   with polyvinyl chloride casing which reduces the thermal neutron nux by
   more than 40\% due to neutron absorption by chlorine, Polyurethane foam,
   which is inert, hydrophobic, and insoluble in water, adheres well to
   both dry and wetted soils, sediments, and rocks. It can be formed in
   situ at a low but controllable, bulk density. At a bulk density of 0.08
   g cm(-3), and in combination with acrylic casing, polyurethane foam
   increases the thermal neutron count by less than 5\% in a saturated
   sand, relative to background. In addition to its small effect on the
   neutron flux, polyurethane foam, unlike bentonite or cement, does not
   affect the moisture content of the surrounding formation during
   installation. Furthermore, because it is a closed-cell foam, its
   moisture content does not change under varying formation moisture
   conditions. As was shown in related field tests, polyurethane foam is
   especially well suited for backfilling boreholes in fractured rocks
   because of its fast set time which minimizes penetration into fractures.
   The design proved to be convenient and durable under rugged field
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{One of the challenges of monitoring network design in a fractured rock
   setting is the heterogeneity of the rocks. This paper summarizes the
   activities and problems associated with the monitoring of contaminated
   groundwater in porous, low-permeability fractured chalk in the Negev
   Desert, Israel, Preferential flow documented in the study area required
   siting the monitoring boreholes in the predominant fracture systems.
   Lineaments traced from aerial photographs were examined in the field to
   sort out the large-extension, through-going, multilayer fracture systems
   crossing the study area. At each proposed drilling site, these fractures
   were exposed below the sediment cover using trenches. Slanted boreholes
   were drilled at a distance from the fracture systems so that each
   borehole would intersect the targeted fracture plane below the water
   table, Based on their short recovery period and contaminated ground
   water, these newly drilled, fracture-oriented boreholes appeared to be
   better connected to preferential flowpaths crossing the industrial site
   than the old boreholes existing on site. Other considerations concerning
   the drilling and logging of monitoring boreholes in a fractured media
   were: (1) coring provides better documentation of the vertical fracture
   distribution, but dry augering is less costly and enables immediate
   ground water sampling and the sampling of vadose rock for contaminant
   analysis; (2) caliper and TV camera logs appear to provide only partial
   information regarding the vertical fracture distribution; and (3) the
   information gained by deepening the monitoring boreholes and testing
   fractures crossing their uncased walls has to be carefully weighed
   against the risk of potential cross-contamination through the monitoring
   boreholes, which is enhanced in fractured media.}},

Abstract = {{Uncompacted vadose zone sand aquifers, with their highly interconnected
   pores and tendency to contain iron-rich cements and clay skins, are not
   necessarily susceptible to characterization by nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) wireline logging. A necessary condition for valid
   application of this technology to such aquifers is that the NMR signal
   may be quantitatively related to pore size. To test the hypothesis that
   this is the case, pore image and NMR data were acquired from cores
   collected from three sand units beneath the Savannah River Site in South
   Carolina. Statistical unmixing of pore image and transverse relaxation
   time (T-2) data allowed the pore space to be subdivided into image-based
   pore types and NMR endmembers, respectively. The image-based pore
   classification bears a systematic relationship to hydraulic
   conductivity, and is thus shown to be petrophysically relevant. However,
   the image-based and NMR components cannot be correlated with one another
   in terms of either volumetric abundance or size characteristics. The
   hypothesis was therefore rejected. The lack of correlation is attributed
   to either, or both, of two effects: coupling of NMR response from
   spatially associated pores of different pore types, and variation in
   pore wall relaxivity resulting from the heterogeneous distribution of
   pore lining iron-stained clay skins. These results do not condemn the
   use of NMR logging in consolidated aquifers in which neither of these
   effects occurs, but further research is needed to establish whether
   there are any conditions under which unconsolidated aquifers may be
   validly characterized using this technique.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled water quantity/quality model was developed and applied to
   estimate ground water recharge and simulate tracer concentrations in the
   mi River Basin of Japan, The ground water basin was divided into five
   sub-basins, each of which contains a surface reservoir and up to three
   subsurface reservoirs. The reservoirs exchange water and solute mass
   among themselves and contribute direct runoff and base flow to adjacent
   streams. The simulation model is parameterized in terms of 14 water
   quantity and three water quality parameters. A parameter calibration
   procedure was implemented wherein streamflow and tracer concentration
   data were used in parameter estimation. Prior information on the
   parameters can be used to initialize and constrain calibrated
   parameters.
   The calibrated model was validated successfully and used to simulate Na+
   and Ca2+ and to estimate ground water recharge in the sub-basins and the
   Ibi River Basin as a whole. Ground water recharge varied substantially
   among sub-drainage basins, reflecting the predominant role of
   precipitation variability in determining deep percolation to the first
   confined aquifer. It was determined that about 10 \% of the gross
   precipitation becomes ground water recharge over the entire Ibi River
   Basin, Analysis of ground water recharge to a large pulse of
   precipitation demonstrated the important effect of impermeable clay
   layers in controlling the magnitude and timing of deep ground water
   recharge. The validation results indicate that the equilibrium
   concentrations of Na+ and Ca2+ in the first confined aquifer have
   negligible sensitivity to their initial concentrations in the simulation
   model. Similar behavior was observed for the equilibrium concentrations
   of these two tracers in reservoir 3, and to a lesser extent in reservoir
   2, The top reservoir exhibited large fluctuations in tracer
   concentrations due to the effect of direct rainfall input.}},

Title = {{Effects of steady-state assumption on hydraulic conductivity and

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-79}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{The ability of a calibrated now model to predict the behavior of a
   surficial aquifer system is governed by the quality of the hydraulic
   conductivity and recharge estimates used. Reasonable lateral and
   vertical hydraulic conductivities can be estimated by steady-state
   simulations driven by effective recharge rates that approximate the net
   effects of evapotranspiration, and water released from storage during
   periods of recession. Results from a hypothetical, transient,
   cross-sectional model indicated that most of the water was contributed
   uniformly from storage from five to 25 days after a recharge event.
   Results also showed that a steady-state, snapshot calibration approach
   can be used on aquifers in a humid climate with diffusivities between 20
   and 500 m(2)/d. Most estimates of the lateral and vertical hydraulic
   conductivities of the hypothetical aquifer system were within 30 \% of
   the actual values. Estimates of hydraulic conductivity from the
   transient cases were similar to those from the snapshot calibration
   cases. The long-term recharge rate could be identified by calibrating to
   multiple synoptic surveys that were sampled over the range of drier to
   wetter conditions. The effective recharge rates estimated for the driest
   and wettest conditions bracketed the long-term recharge rate, Results
   suggested that the effective recharge rate estimated for the synoptic
   survey with the lowest water level root-mean-square (RMS) error was the
   best estimate of the long-term recharge rate. A field application of the
   snapshot calibration approach simulated the surficial aquifer system
   beneath Cecil Field Naval Air Station well and provided reasonable
   estimates of the long-term recharge rate (0.4 mm/d) relative to the
   range of recharge rates that were independently estimated by the
   chloride concentration ratio method (0.2 to 0.6 mm/d).}},

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional, field scale, finite-element ground water model was
   developed to simulate the ground water discharge process within an
   unconfined coastal aquifer, Model development was based on the density
   dependent fluid flow approach with water table and dynamic tidal
   boundary conditions, The performance of the model was compared against
   data collected from the Columbia Aquifer on the eastern shore of
   Virginia. The dynamic tidal boundary conditions were necessary to
   reproduce the surficial mixing zone observed within the ground water
   intertidal zone of the aquifer, The model was able to reproduce field
   data on the movement of the near-shore water table, ground water salt
   concentrations, and ground water discharge rates and patterns. The model
   was not able to replicate the short-term fluctuation in salt
   concentration observed within the surficial mixing zone, The inability
   to account for the wave action of the tides,within the intertidal zone
   is believed to be responsible for this difficulty. The development of
   the model provided a new method to investigate ground water discharge to
   coastal systems.}},

Abstract = {{Eight factors were examined to determine their influence on the
   transmissivities of 35 domestic wells drilled in glaciated, metamorphic
   bedrock. Wells were grouped into categories on the basis of bedrock
   type, topographic position, structural setting, proximity to
   fracture-correlated lineaments, overburden type, overburden thickness,
   proximity to surface water bodies, and water table depth. Results
   indicate that bedrock type, topographic setting proximity to
   fracture-correlated lineaments, and structural position explain 34, 31,
   15 and 12\% of the observed variation in transmissivity, respectively,
   and are the only variables that have a statistically significant(90\%
   confidence level) relationship with transmissivity. In this study, wells
   situated in amphibolite bedrock in upland valleys and flats located less
   than or equal to 25 m from fracture-correlated lineaments and positioned
   on the axes of major folds are the most productive, Review of the
   literature and comparison of results from this study with those from
   three other investigations, each representing geologic environments
   (carbonate, elastic sedimentary, and unglaciated metamorphic/igneous
   terrains), indicates that well productivity varies with geologic
   setting; a set of factors in one geologic environment does not
   necessarily have the same significance when applied to wells in a
   different geologic setting.}},

Abstract = {{A solution is obtained for stream flow depletion created by pumping from
   a well beside a stream. This solution assumes that streambed penetration
   of the aquifer and dimensions of the streambed cross section are all
   relatively small. It also assumes that the streambed is clogged and that
   a linear relationship exists between the outflow seepage through the
   streambed and the change in piezometric head across the semipervious
   clogging layer. The solution is general enough to include the earlier
   solutions of Theis, Glover and Balmer, and Hantush, A solution is also
   obtained for the drawdown at any point within the aquifer, and it is
   suggested that this solution might be matched with experimental field
   data to obtain estimates for aquifer and streambed leakage parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Transport of the bacteria Klebsiella oxytoca and Burkholderia cepacia
   G4PR1 (G4PR1) was investigated in column experiments conducted under
   conditions that allowed us to quantify sorption under a range of ground
   water velocities. Column experiments (33 mm I.D. x 114 mm long columns)
   were conducted at four linear water velocities (0.5 to 14 cm hr(-1))
   through a medium to coarse grained silica sand. The peak C/Co
   concentrations for both bacteria were attenuated with respect to a
   conservative tracer (Cl-), and well-defined tailing was observed.
   Breakthroughs of both bacteria,were influenced by the water velocity. In
   the case of G4PR1, the attenuation of the peak C/Co concentrations
   increased as the velocity decreased while the peak C/Co concentrations
   for K, oxytoca were similar at velocities between 3 and 13 cm hr(-1) but
   decreased at the lowest velocity tested (0.6 cm hr(-1)). The tailing
   reached constant C/Co values of between 2 X 10(-3) and 5 X 10(-3), and
   between 2 x 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-5) for K, oxytoca and G4PR1 after 2t(o).
   A one-dimensional mathematical model for advective-dispersive transport
   that accounts for irreversible (k(irr)) and reversible (k(f) and k(f))
   sorption was used to quantify the sorption process. Both irreversible
   and reversible sorption was required to obtain good fits to the measured
   K. oxytoca data. Results of this modeling suggested that k(irr) and k(r)
   are independent of velocity and an empirical relationship was developed
   relating k(f) to velocity. For G4PR1, the best fits were obtained using
   only reversible sorption, Results of the modeling suggested that k(f)
   was independent of velocity at all velocities tested and k(r) was
   independent of velocity at velocities between 3 and 13 cm hr(-1). At the
   lowest velocity investigated (0.5 cm hr(-1)), the kf value decreased
   considerably. This study showed that sorption characteristics are
   bacteria specific, and are likely related to surface chemistry because
   G4PR1 is more hydrophobic than K oxytoca, The study also showed that in
   order for bacterial transport experiments to be directly applicable to
   the subsurface, they should be conducted at velocities similar to those
   observed in the subsurface, or the relationship between the sorption
   parameter(s) and velocity should be known.}},

Abstract = {{The fate of seven aromatic and four chlorinated aliphatic compounds was
   studied using in situ microcosm (ISM) and laboratory batch (LB)
   experiments performed at six distances along a flow line in the
   anaerobic leachate plume downgradient of the Grindsted Landfill,
   Denmark. The redox conditions were dominated by iron reduction in this
   part of the plume (15 to 60 m downgradient of the landfill); however,
   methanogenesis and sulfate reduction also took place closer to the
   landfill (15 to 45 m). Generally, goad accordance was found between the
   degradation of the compounds determined by the two experimental
   approaches, considering the limitations of the experimental periods (up
   to 220 days for the ISM and up to 537 days for the LB). Of the aromatic
   compounds, toluene, o- and m/p-xylene were degraded, while benzene,
   ethylbenzene, and naphthalene were not degraded, neither in the ISM nor
   in the LB at any distance from the landfill. All the
   chlorinated-aliphatic compounds, (TeCM, 1,1,1-TCA, PCE, and TCE) were
   degradable; however, the degradation potential for PCE and TCE depended
   on the distance from the landfill. For most compounds, both approaches
   gave results comparable to those of the natural gradient field injection
   experiment performed in the same plume. This suggests that laboratory
   batch experiments, which are easier to run than ISM experiments, may be
   a useful tool in determining the degradability of mono aromatic
   hydrocarbons and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons under strongly
   anaerobic conditions in the investigation of natural attenuation in
   landfill leachate plumes.}},

Abstract = {{Bioremediation, the use of microbial degradation processes to detoxify
   environmental contamination, was first applied to petroleum
   hydrocarbon-contaminated ground water systems in the early 1970s, Since
   that time, these technologies have evolved in some ways that were
   clearly anticipated by early investigators, and in other ways that were
   not foreseen. The expectation that adding oxidants and nutrients to
   contaminated aquifers would enhance biodegradation, for example, has
   been born out by subsequent experience. Many of the technologies now in
   common use such as air sparging, hydrogen peroxide addition, nitrate
   addition, and bioslurping, are conceptually similar to the first
   bioremediation systems put into operation. More unexpected, however,
   were the considerable technical problems associated with delivering
   oxidants and nutrients to heterogeneous ground water systems. Experience
   has shown that the success of engineered bioremediation systems depends
   largely on how effectively directions and rates of ground water now can
   be controlled, and thus how efficiently oxidants and nutrients can be
   delivered to contaminated aquifer sediments.
   The early expectation that injecting laboratory-selected or genetically
   engineered cultures of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria into aquifers
   would be a useful bioremediation technology has not been born out by
   subsequent experience. Rather, it appears that petroleum
   hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria are ubiquitous in ground water systems
   and that bacterial addition is usually unnecessary. Perhaps the
   technology that was least anticipated by early investigators was the
   development of intrinsic bioremediation, Experience has shown that
   natural attenuation mechanisms - biodegradation, dilution, and sorption
   - limit the migration of contaminants to some degree in all ground water
   systems. Intrinsic bioremediation is the deliberate use of natural
   attenuation processes to treat contaminated ground water to specified
   concentration levels at predetermined points in the aquifer, In current
   practice, intrinsic bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons requires a
   systematic assessment to show that ambient natural attenuation
   mechanisms are efficient enough to meet regulatory requirements and a
   monitoring program to verify that performance requirements are met in
   the future.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrate and pesticide use in the 800 km(2) Raisin River agricultural
   watershed in eastern Ontario, Canada, threatens the quality of ground
   water in the highly exploited regional carbonate aquifer overlain by
   sandy till, To assess local recharge contributions through the
   cultivated fields, monthly monitoring of ground water levels,
   geochemistry, and environmental isotopes (delta(2)H(H2O),
   delta(13)C(DIC)) was carried out for 12 wells over a 14-month period,
   Seasonal water level variations suggest that recharge is constrained to
   spring and late fall when transpiration is minimized and the ground is
   not frozen, However, H-2 monitoring shows that early summer
   precipitation also contributes to recharge. Variations in delta(2)H
   values between monitoring sites suggest a local component to recharge,
   delta(13)C(DIC) was used to distinguish between dissolved inorganic
   carbon (DIC) originating from natural (C-3) vegetation and DIC from the
   cultivated corridors where corn is grown (C-4 vegetation), Seasonal
   variations in delta(13)C(DIC) are remarkably coherent for all wells,
   with uniform trends to positive values during periods of low water table
   elevation, During periods of high water table (spring and late fall),
   delta(13)C(DIC) values are between - 13 and - 16 parts per thousand VPDB
   (Vienna Peedee Belemnite), reflecting DIC originating from a dominantly
   natural (C-3) vegetation. When ground water levels are low (summer and
   mid-winter), delta(13)C(DIC) values shift to between - 11 and -7 parts
   per thousand, The seasonal enrichments in delta(13)C(DIC) are clear
   evidence for a local contribution to recharge by direct infiltration
   though the fields, This contribution is enhanced during periods of low
   water level, likely due to drainage from the phreatic aquifer, High DOC
   (dissolved organic carbon) concentrations (> 10 to 30 mg-Cn) correlate
   with periods of high water levels indicating infiltration of labile
   organics to the carbonate aquifer.
   The work carried out for this paper shows that the conjunctive use of
   environmental isotope geochemistry and physical parameters are
   fundamental to assessing the risk of ground water contamination in
   agricultural watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) that pool above stratigraphic
   contacts as a result of capillary forces can migrate downward through
   fractures in the underlying fine-grained layer, Although the DNAPL in
   the fracture is excluded from the surrounding porous matrix by capillary
   forces, the DNAPL constituent will dissolve and migrate by diffusion
   into the matrix. As a front of moderately soluble DNAPL advances into a
   fracture, the nux of dissolved material into the matrix increases until
   it becomes comparable to the rate of now into the fracture, reducing the
   pressure in the DNAPL phase and slowing its advance. If the DNAPL front
   encounters a constriction with sufficiently large entry pressure, its
   advance will halt temporarily, But as the concentration gradients
   driving diffusion into the matrix decrease, there will be less DNAPL
   lost by diffusion and the DNAPL pressure at the constriction will
   increase until it exceeds the entry pressure, causing the downward
   advance of the front to suddenly resume. Because the time scales of
   diffusion are much slower than those of density flow this analysis
   suggests that under certain circumstances a DNAPL can suddenly resume
   its downward advance after a long period of apparent immobility. In one
   plausible example, a dichloromethane front passes through 5 m of
   fractured clay in 16 days, is immobile for more than four years, and
   then suddenly moves again. Where this phenomenon is possible, removal of
   DNAPL to protect underlying aquifers becomes more important as a
   remediation goal.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental data often have features that are distinct from data in
   other branches of science. These features include spatial and/or
   temporal auto-correlation, natural heterogeneity, measurement errors,
   small sample sizes, and simultaneous existence of different types and
   qualities of data. Realistic environmental modeling requires simulation
   procedures that account for all of these features. In this study, a
   model of uncertainty analysis, BUDA, is used to account for the noted
   features and provide a unified framework for quantification,
   propagation, and reduction of uncertainty, The BUDA model is used to
   analyze the development of a chloride plume around an old landfill to
   the year 2020, This article describes the different components of BUDA
   as they relate to the landfill application.}},

Abstract = {{A dipole probe (DP) for measuring vertical variations of hydraulic
   conductivity has been designed, constructed, and tested in field
   conditions, The variable-length device designed for the dipole flow test
   (DFT) consists of three packers separated by changeable spacer rods. The
   assembled DP is lowered into a well with a long screened interval. The
   packers are inflated, isolating two screened sections (chambers) between
   them. A small submersible pump, mounted on the central packer, transfers
   water from the upper (extraction) chamber into the lower (injection)
   chamber. This simultaneous injection and extraction creates a
   recirculatory flow within the aquifer, The chamber head responses are
   measured by two pressure transducers in the DP chambers. The DP can be
   used at discrete intervals along the entire well screen length. The DP
   has been successfully tested in a specially constructed well with a
   continuous screen in a highly conductive sand and gravel aquifer. During
   drilling, disturbed samples were collected using the split spoon method
   and the vertical profile of K was estimated from grain-size analysis. A
   total of 153 DFTs were performed with various DP geometries, Results
   indicate that the chamber head changes are sensitive to aquifer
   properties, reach steady state rapidly, vary linearly with recirculation
   pumping rate, and can be controlled by changes in DP dimensions,
   Vertical profiles of K compare well,vith grain-size analysis estimates.}},

Abstract = {{We study the probabilities that monitoring systems will be capable of
   detecting subsurface contaminant plumes. The analysis is an extension of
   previous research which focused on detection of ore bodies and
   contaminant releases to the subsurface using probabilistic models; the
   previous research assumed that releases to the subsurface are elliptical
   in shape, and that detections are absolute when a monitoring point
   intercepts a release. New features are introduced into the analytical
   framework that include irregular, rather than regular, sampling arrays,
   as well as nonuniform probabilities of a release occurring at a
   particular location of the site. These features allow the user to
   optimize the location of sampling devices based on site knowledge, by
   concentrating monitoring locations where a release is believed more
   likely. The stratified Monte Carlo approach used in this paper is tested
   on a number of cases with uniform and nonuniform sampler distribution
   and release probabilities, The results provide statistical probabilities
   that one is capable of finding releases of different sizes with a system
   of monitoring points.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},

Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between the hydrogeologic properties and sedimentary
   facies of shallow Pennsylvanian bedrock aquifers was examined using
   detailed sedimentologic descriptions, aquifer (slug) tests, and gamma
   ray logs. The main goal of the study was to determine if it was possible
   to reliably estimate near-well hydraulic conductivities using core
   descriptions and logging data at a complex field site, based on
   assignment of consistent conductivity indicators to individual facies,
   Lithologic information was gathered from three sources: core
   descriptions, simplified lithologic columns derived from the core
   descriptions, and drillers' logs, Gamma ray data were collected with a
   conventional logging instrument. Slug tests were conducted in all wells
   containing screened zones entirely within the Pennsylvanian facies of
   interest.
   Simplified subsets of sedimentologic facies were assembled for
   classification of subsurface geology, and all rocks within the screened
   intervals of test wells were assigned to individual facies based on
   visual descriptions, Slug tests were conducted to determine the bulk
   hydraulic conductivity (a spatial average within the screened interval)
   in the immediate vicinity of the wells, with measured values varying
   from 10(-4) m/s to 10(-8) m/s. Gamma ray logs from these wells revealed
   variations in raw counts above about 1.5 orders of magnitude.
   Data were combined using simple linear and nonlinear inverse techniques
   to derive relations between sedimentologic facies, gamma ray signals,
   and bulk hydraulic conductivities. The analyses suggest that facies data
   alone, even those derived from detailed core descriptions, are
   insufficient for estimating hydraulic conductivity in this setting to
   better than an order of magnitude. The addition of gamma ray data
   improved the estimates, as did selective filtering of several extreme
   values from the full data set. Better estimates might be obtained
   through more careful field measurements and reduction of associated
   errors, collection and incorporation of some form of continuous porosity
   log, or use of spatial statistics or more sophisticated inversion
   techniques. The utility of the approach remains to be tested through
   modeling and additional direct measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for the study of thermal waters in unexploited aquifers is
   proposed. This methodology has been applied to the Alhama Aquifer, which
   is the origin of the most important thermal springs of the Iberian
   Peninsula. A conceptual model was made of the aquifer by integrating
   data such as (1) the geometry at depth (on the basis of deep geophysics)
   and at the surface (from conventional geological maps); (2) hydrographic
   analysis of the aquifer discharge; (3) a study of the recharge by
   classic hydrometeorological methods; and (4) conventional and isotopic
   hydrochemistry. In addition to the hydraulic regional parameters it
   provides, the model explains the origin of the Alhama springs in terms
   of simple circulation at a depth of some 900 m and a normal geothermal
   gradient (3 degrees C/100 m), with no requirement of contact with a
   source of heat at the bottom of the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive series of single-well, push-pull tests was performed to
   quantify horizontal and vertical spatial variability in aerobic
   respiration and denitrification rates in a petroleum-contaminated
   aquifer, The results indicated rapid consumption of injected O-2 or NO3-
   in shallow and deep test intervals across a large portion of the site,
   Computed first-order rate coefficients for aerobic respiration ranged
   from 0.15 to 1.69 h(-1) in the shallow test interval, and from 0.08 to
   0.83 h(-1) in the deep test interval. The largest aerobic respiration
   rates occurred on the upgradient edge of the contaminant plume where
   concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and dissolved O-2 were
   relatively high. Computed first-order rate coefficients for
   denitrification ranged from 0.09 to 0.42 h(-1) in the shallow test
   interval, and from 0.11 to 0.28 h(-1) in the deep test interval. The
   largest denitrification rates occurred on the downgradient edge of the
   plume where hydrocarbon concentrations were relatively high but
   dissolved oxygen concentrations were small. The rates reported here
   represent maximal rates of aerobic respiration and denitrification, as
   supported by high concentrations of electron accepters in the injected
   test solutions. Production of dissolved CO2 during aerobic respiration
   and denitrification tests provided evidence that O-2 and NO3-
   consumption was largely due to microbial activity. Additional evidence
   for microbial NO3- consumption was provided by reduced rates of NO3-
   consumption when dissolved O-2 was injected with NO3-, and by increased
   N2O production when C2H2 was injected with NO3-.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive drilling and testing program was undertaken at Carleton
   University, Ottawa, Canada, to characterize the aquifer for the design
   of an aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES) system. The substantial data
   base provides an excellent record of well yields and hydraulic responses
   to a series of aquifer tests in a faulted carbonate aquifer. Well yield
   variability is reflected in the wide range in specific capacity (1.4 to
   75.8 L/s/m) and is dependent upon the proximity of a well to a major
   fault. Constant discharge data, available for nine pumping wells and
   several observation wells, reflect both the excellent hydraulic
   connection along major faults and the limited hydraulic connection
   between fault blocks. Three different flow models, including vertical
   fracture and vertical dyke (linear), and Theis (radial), are used to
   interpret constant discharge test data from nine pumping wells and
   several observation wells. In all tests, the duration of pumping is
   sufficient to identify early-time linear now along faults and late-time
   pseudo-radial flow between fault blocks. This paper demonstrates the
   influence of fault-induced heterogeneity on the hydraulic response of a
   carbonate aquifer and demonstrates the application and limitation of
   simple radial continuum models to aquifers of this type.}},

Abstract = {{A coupled field-scale aquifer pumping and water infiltration test was
   conducted at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory
   in order to evaluate subsurface water and contaminant transport
   processes in a heterogeneous flow system. The test included an aquifer
   pumping test to determine the storage properties of the aquifer and the
   state of confinement of the aquifer (similar to 190 m below land
   surface), and a vadose zone infiltration test to determine vertical
   moisture and radioactive tracer migration rates, Pump test results
   indicated that the Snake River Plain Aquifer was locally unconfined with
   a transmissivity ranging from 5.57 X 10(5) to 9.29 X 10(4) m(2)/day.
   Moisture monitoring with neutron probes indicated that infiltrating
   water was initially transported vertically through the upper basalt
   layer of the vadose zone, primarily through fractures and rubble zones,
   at an average rate of 5 m/day (based on vertical distance traveled and
   first arrival of water at the monitoring points), Analysis of
   breakthrough curves for a conservative tracer allowed estimation of the
   arrival of the peak concentration and yielded an average velocity of 1
   m/day, The migration velocities from the neutron probe and tracer tests
   are in good agreement given the scale of the test and difference in
   analysis techniques. None of the data sets showed a correlation between
   migration velocity (arrival time) and distance from the point source,
   but they strongly indicate preferential flow through discrete fractures.
   Upon reaching the first continuous sedimentary interbed layer in the
   basalt formation, water flow was diverted laterally along the interbed
   surface where it spread outward in primarily three areas corresponding
   to topographic lows on the interbed surface, and slowly infiltrated into
   the interbed, The nonpredictable movement of water and tracer through
   specific fractures underlying the site suggests that a priori prediction
   of transmissive fractures in this media is not possible. Results do
   suggest that the continuous sedimentary interbed layers, in general,
   impede vertical water flow and contaminant migration.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of advection and dispersion for both solute and
   vapor transport can be determined from type curves for concentration,
   flux, or cumulative nux, The dimensionless form of the type curves
   provides a means to directly evaluate the importance of mass transport
   by advection relative to that of mass transport by diffusion and
   dispersion. Type curves based on an analytical solution to the
   advection-dispersion equation are plotted in terms of dimensionless time
   and Peclet number. Flux and cumulative flux type curves provide
   additional rationale for transport regime determination in addition to
   the traditional concentration type curves. The extension of type curves
   to include vapor transport with phase partitioning in the unsaturated
   zone is a new development, Type curves for negative Peclet numbers also
   are presented. A negative Peclet number characterizes a problem in which
   the direction of now is toward the contamination source, and thereby
   diffusion and advection can act in opposite directions. Examples are the
   diffusion of solutes away from the downgradient edge of a pump-and-treat
   capture zone, the upward diffusion of vapors through the unsaturated
   zone with recharge, and the diffusion of solutes through a low hydraulic
   conductivity cutoff wall with an inward advective gradient.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a geoelectrical and geostatistical-based methodology
   that can be used to screen unregulated landfills for the presence of
   leachate and obtain an approximation of the vertical/spatial extent of
   waste, The methodology uses a surface electromagnetic (EM) survey
   combined with indicator kriging, Indicator kriging allo,vs for the use
   of EM data that have been collected over highly electrically conductive
   material such as that occurring, within landfills, Indicator kriging
   maps were generated for several vertical sections cut through a landfill
   to establish the landfill strata, Similarly, horizontal sections were
   generated to evaluate the areal extent of waste and leachate in the
   vadose zone and saturated zones, respectively. The horizontal and
   vertical maps were combined to estimate the volume of solid waste and
   liquid within three zones: (1) waste, (2) waste and/or leachate, and (3)
   potential leachate, The methodology appears hold promise in providing
   results that can be used as part of a hazard assessment, or to assist in
   the placement of monitoring wells at sites requiring additional study. A
   case study is used to demonstrate the methodology at an unregulated
   landfill in eastern Nebraska.}},

Abstract = {{This study explores the use of multiple isotopic tracers to evaluate the
   processes involved in nitrate attenuation in ground water. delta(15)N
   and delta(18)O are used to provide information about the role of
   denitrification on nitrate attenuation, and delta(34)S, delta(18)O, and
   delta(13)C are used to evaluate the role of reduced sulfur and carbon as
   electron donors for nitrate reduction. The focus of this study is a zone
   of significant NO3-1 attenuation occurring in a sand aquifer impacted by
   septic system contamination. The NO3-1 pattern, the ground water flow
   system, and changes in other chemical parameters suggest that the NO3-1
   depletion is caused by denitrification. This is supported by the nitrate
   delta(15)N and delta(18)O data which both show significant isotopic
   enrichment as NO3-1 depletion proceeds along the flowpath, The increase
   of sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon observed in the zone of
   nitrate attenuation suggests that reduced sulfur in addition to carbon
   is also involved in denitrification. This is supported by a trend toward
   depleted sulfate delta(34)S and delta(18)O values in the zone of sulfate
   increase, which reflects the input of sulfate formed by the oxidation of
   biogenic pyrite present in the aquifer sediments. The trend toward
   depleted delta(13)C values in the zone of increasing dissolved inorganic
   carbon reflects the input of organic carbon into this carbon pool.
   Chemical mass balance indicates that carbon is the dominant electron
   donor; however, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of using
   multiple isotopic tracers for providing insight into the processes
   affecting nitrate attenuation in ground water.}},

Abstract = {{Contaminant transformation rates are routinely estimated from monitoring
   well data using a regression method based on a steady-state analytical

   presence of a continuous boundary concentration and a uniform
   first-order degradation coefficient. It must be recognized that this
   type of analysis is easily subject to misinterpretation, particularly
   when few monitoring points are used. This is because the dispersive
   nature of solute transport can produce concentration profiles which
   closely resemble those associated with a degrading contaminant even in
   the absence of any transformation processes. Monte Carlo analyses using
   simulated plumes suggest that this method may lead to significant
   overestimates of apparent transformation rates.}},

Title = {{Lateral chloride migration from a landfill in a fractured clay-rich
   glacial deposit}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{988-999}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{A plume of chloride (100 to > 1000 mg/L) was found to extend up to 40 m
   laterally from the edge of a landfill located on a thick sequence of
   clay-rich glacial deposits. The plume is mainly confined to the
   seasonally saturated highly weathered and fractured zone (upper 3 to 4
   m) of the deposits. in the high concentration region of the plume there
   was good agreement between chloride concentrations determined from
   piezometer water samples, which were expected to sample fracture pore
   water, and pore water extractions from continuous core samples, which
   were expected to be dominated by pore water from the fine-grained
   matrix. The pore water extractions provided much better lateral and
   vertical resolution of the plume than was obtained from the piezometer
   water samples. The length of the plume based on the data from the
   piezometer water samples was 12 m less than the length determined from
   the core samples, apparently because the piezometers were located above
   or below the relatively thin plume, or were above the water table at the
   time of sampling. Chloride concentrations in many of the deeper
   piezometers were higher than measured in core samples. This was likely
   due to inflow from the shallow highly contaminated zone during drilling,
   as indicated by declining concentration values measured in many of these
   piezometers over a 10-month period. The core samples were protected by a
   liner and were not significantly influenced by drilling-induced
   contamination. Downhole electrical conductivity profiles measured,vith a
   Geonics EM-39 correlated well with chloride concentration profiles
   determined from the core samples. Surface measurements of electrical
   conductivity with a Geonics EM-31 were effective at detecting the edge
   of the waste (which was buried under 2 m of clay), but were less
   effective at detecting the lateral extent of the chloride plume. Based
   on this and previous investigations, it is expected that an equivalent
   porous medium (EPM) approach will be appropriate for simulating lateral
   contaminant transport in the highly weathered and fractured zone.
   However, predictive modeling of the behavior of the chloride plume will
   be complicated by the presence of multiple possible sources of chloride
   and uncertainty concerning the hydraulic conductivity distribution, as
   well as by difficulty in predicting the influence of large seasonal
   variations in the elevation and slope of the water table.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1000-1010}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Phosphate distribution was reviewed in 10 mature, highly monitored
   septic system ground water plumes in central Canada. It was shown that
   six plumes (primarily those on calcareous sands) of enriched P
   concentrations (0.5 to 5 mg/L P) exceeding 10 m in length are present.
   In each case, phosphate migration velocity is highly retarded
   (retardation factor, 20 to 100) compared to the ground water velocity,
   but migration rates remain sufficiently fast (similar to 1 m/a) to be of
   concern when considering long-term operation and the normal setback
   distance of septic systems from adjacent surface water bodies (similar
   to 15 m), Much smaller scale phosphate plumes (< 3 m in length) are
   present at the acidic sites on noncalcareous sands and on silt- and
   clay-rich sediments.
   At all of the sites, ground water concentrations are lower than effluent
   values by amounts ranging from 23 to 99\%, suggesting that P
   accumulation has occurred in the vadose zone. This was confirmed by
   sediment analyses at four of the sites which, in each case, showed that
   zones of P enrichment were present within 1 m of the infiltration pipes
   (Wood 1993; Zanini et al. 1998), Also, observed phosphate concentrations
   are generally consistent with values expected based on the solubility
   constraints of the minerals vivianite in reducing zones (including the
   septic tank), and strengite and variscite in oxidizing zones, providing
   further evidence that mineral precipitation reactions play a role in
   limiting P concentrations. Strengite and variscite have the potential to
   limit P to low concentrations (< 0.1 mg/L) under acidic conditions, but
   oxidation of sewage effluent leads to acidic conditions only in
   noncalcareous terrain or beneath old septic systems where calcium
   carbonate has been depleted, Overall, phosphate plume migration
   velocities in ground water appear to be controlled by sorption
   processes, but the phosphate concentrations that are present in the
   plumes appear to be strongly controlled by mineral precipitation
   reactions that occur in close proximity to the infiltration pipes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates that analytic element models have potential as
   powerful screening tools that can facilitate or improve calibration of
   more complicated finite-difference and finite-element models. We
   demonstrate how a two-dimensional analytic element model was used to
   identify errors in a complex three-dimensional finite difference model
   caused by incorrect specification of boundary conditions. An improved
   finite-difference model was developed using boundary conditions
   developed from a far-field analytic element model. Calibration of a
   revised finite-difference model was achieved using fewer zones of
   hydraulic conductivity and lake bed conductance than the original
   finite-difference model, Calibration statistics were also improved in
   that simulated base-flows were much closer to measured values. The
   improved calibration is due mainly to improved specification of the
   boundary conditions made possible by first solving the far-field problem
   with an analytic element model.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical technique for spatial (lateral and vertical) zooming in
   finite-difference multiaquifer ground water flow models with a
   point-centered finite-difference scheme is presented. A composite,
   rectangular finite-difference mesh is used, allowing for different mesh
   resolutions and/or layering in hierarchically associated windows of the
   flow domain. An iterative procedure, called mesh interface simulator
   (MIS), is developed to link the parent and child meshes along their
   boundaries, referred to as interfaces, MIS equates the piezometric head
   along and the lateral flux across the interface. A numerical example of
   four interbedded meshes in a two-aquifer system with spatial zooming is
   evaluated, The results of numerical simulation are compared to an
   analytical solution to assess the overall approximation error of the
   numerical finite-difference and MIS procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to assess the effects of variable density
   ground water flow on capture zones for pumping wells on islands and the
   ability of numerical and analytical methods to account for these
   effects, Mathematical modeling is used to simulate variable density
   ground water flow for an island aquifer system. Coupled fresh water-salt
   water transport equations derived using sharp interface theory are
   solved using the finite-element method. Reverse particle tracking is
   used to compute the capture zone for a well. Sensitivity studies are
   completed using a quasi-three-dimensional model to identify the
   influence of variable density flow on the computed zone of contribution
   to a Dumping well. Quantitative results indicate that the size and shape
   of the capture zone are sensitive to the natural geometry of the fresh
   water lens and the effects of fresh water-salt water upconing. This is
   especially true for pumping wells located close to the coastline. For
   the conditions considered in this study, accounting for variable density
   ground water from resulted in capture zones approximately 21\% larger
   than those predicted assuming a uniform fresh water aquifer thickness
   and constant hydraulic gradient, This effect of variable density flow on
   the predicted capture zones diminished away from the coastline. The
   study results serve to caution model users of the limitations inherent
   in using analytical methods to compute capture zone delineations for
   island aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{Inferred increases in 1981 to 1997 pumping records suggest that by the
   year 2020, the majority of Nantucket Island municipal wellfields will be
   pumping near or at capacity. A sharp-interface model is used in this
   study to assess the impact of projected increases in pumping from the
   Wyers Valley and proposed State Forest municipal wellfields on Nantucket
   Island, Massachusetts. The model was first calibrated as part of a
   sensitivity study using a nine-year record of monthly water level data
   from a monitoring well network and salinity data from a deep borehole
   completed near the island's center. Best-fit values of hydraulic
   conductivity and specific storage obtained in the sensitivity analysis
   are in good agreement with those measured by single and multiple well
   aquifer tests across the island.
   The calibrated model was used to assess hydrologic conditions across the
   island between 1997 and 2020 due to projected increases in municipal
   wellfield pumping. Transient simulation results suggest that salt water
   will invade the well screen of the deep (32 m) Wyers Valley production
   well by the year 2014, Further, the width of the fresh water/salt water
   mixing zone under the municipal wellfields will triple by 2020 due to
   increasing seasonal fluctuations in pumping required to accommodate
   summer tourism. Using published estimates of 2020 municipal wellfield
   pumping, wellhead delineation zones were also calculated using a variety
   of assumptions regarding the island's fresh water lens geometry
   (uniform, variable thickness with no upconing; variable thickness with
   upconing), Results indicate that the calculated delineation zones are
   most sensitive to island geometry and, to a lesser extent, to the fresh
   water lens thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Arsenic concentrations in ground water of the lower Madison River
   valley, Montana, are high (16 to 176 mu g/L). Previous studies
   hypothesized that arsenic-rich river water, applied as irrigation, was
   evapoconcentrated during recharge and contaminated the thin alluvial
   aquifer, Based on additional data collection and a reevaluation of the
   hydrology and geochemistry of the valley, the high arsenic
   concentrations in ground water are caused by a unique combination of
   natural hydrologic and geochemical factors, and irrigation appears to
   play a secondary role. The high arsenic concentrations in ground water
   have several causes: direct aquifer recharge by Madison River water
   having arsenic concentrations as high as 100 mu g/L, leaching of arsenic
   from Tertiary volcano-elastic sediment, and release of sorbed arsenic
   where redox conditions in ground water are reduced. The findings are
   consistent with related studies that demonstrate that arsenic is sorbed
   by irrigated soils in the valley, Although evaporation of applied
   irrigation water does not significantly increase arsenic concentrations
   in ground water, irrigation with arsenic-rich water raises other
   environmental concerns.}},

Abstract = {{The alteration of wetland habitats by natural and anthropogenic
   processes is an issue of worldwide concern. Understanding the changes
   that occur in wetlands often requires knowledge of how surface water
   levels relate to adjacent aquifer systems. The ability to simulate
   surface water movement and its interaction with ground water and wetland
   slough channels is a desirable step in the design of many projects
   constructed in or near wetlands. Currently, most ground water flow
   models incorporate wetland systems as general head boundary nodes. The
   purpose of this research was to develop a computer package for the
   widely used MODFLOW code that would simulate three-dimensional wetland
   flow hydroperiods and wetland interactions with aquifers and slough
   channels, The ground water flow model was used to reproduce the surface
   water now process through wetlands, and then to estimate new flow rates
   and values using a Manning-type equation. This package represents flow
   routing, export and import of water, and evapotranspiration from
   wetlands for different hydroperiods. A basic verification procedure for
   the numerical solution of the diffusion equation was applied, based on a
   test case that was solved using a two-dimensional surface water model.
   This example is a transient solution to the diffusion equation, in which
   the initial conditions were depicted by a sinusoidal water surface
   profile and a flat bottom.}},

Abstract = {{Microencapsulation of degradative organisms enhances microorganism
   survivability (Stormo and Crawford 1994), The use of encapsulated cell
   microbeads for in situ biodegradation depends not only on microorganism
   survival but also on microbead transport characteristics. Two
   forced-gradient, recirculating-loop tracer experiments were conducted to
   evaluate the feasibility of encapsulated cell transport and
   bioremediation on the basis of polystyrene microsphere transport
   results. The tracer tests were conducted in a shallow, confined,
   unconsolidated, heterogeneous, sedimentary aquifer using bromide ion and
   2 mu m, 5 mu m, and 15 mu m microsphere tracers.
   Significant differences were observed in the transport of bromide solute
   and polystyrene microspheres, Microspheres reached peak concentrations
   in monitoring wells before bromide, which was thought to reflect the
   influence of aquifer heterogeneity. Greater decreases in microsphere
   C/C-0 ratios were observed,vith distance from the injection wells than
   in bromide C/C-0 ratios, which was attributed to particle filtration
   and/or settling.
   Several methods might be considered for introducing encapsulated cell
   microbeads into a subsurface environment, including direct injection
   into a contaminated aquifer zone, injection through a recirculating
   ground water flow system, or emplacement in a subsurface microbial
   curtain in advance of a plume. However, the in situ use of encapsulated
   cells in an aquifer is probably limited to aquifers containing
   sufficiently large pore spaces, allowing passage of at least some
   encapsulated cells. The use of encapsulated cells may also be limited by
   differences in solute and microbead transport patterns and flowpath
   clogging by larger encapsulated cell microbeads.}},

Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the analysis of pumping test data, the quality of the determined
   aquifer parameters can be greatly improved by using a proper model of
   the aquifer system, Moench (1995) provided an analytical solution for
   flow to a well partially penetrating an unconfined aquifer, His
   solution, in contrast to the Neuman solution (1974), accounts for the
   noninstantaneous decline of the water table (delayed yield).
   Consequently, the calculated drawdown in these two solutions is
   different under certain circumstances, and this difference may therefore
   affect the computation of aquifer properties from pumping test data.
   This paper uses an inverse computational method to calculate four
   aquifer parameters as well as a delayed yield parameter, alpha(1), from
   pumping test data using both the Neuman (1974) and Moench (1995)
   solutions. Time-drawdown data sets from a pumping test in an unconfined
   alluvial aquifer near Grand Island, Nebraska, were analyzed. In
   single-well analyses, horizontal hydraulic conductivity values derived
   from the Moench solution are lower, but vertical hydraulic conductivity
   values are higher than those calculated from the Neuman solution.
   However, the hydraulic conductivity values in composite-well analyses
   from both solutions become very close. Furthermore, the Neuman solution
   produces similar hydraulic conductivity values in the single-well and
   composite-well analyses, but the Moench solution does not. While
   variable alpha(1) seems to play a role in affecting the computation of
   aquifer parameters in the single-well analysis, a much smaller effect
   was observed in the composite-well analysis, In general, specific yield
   determined using the Moench solution could be slightly higher than the
   values from the Neuman solution; however, they are still lower than the
   realistic values for sand and gravel aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{The results of field tracer experiments performed in the Lindau
   fractured rock test site (southern Black Forest, Germany) and subsequent
   modeling are presented, A vertical, hydrothermally mineralized fault
   zone, with a permeability much greater than the surrounding granite
   mass, lies beneath a planned dam site. A dense network of boreholes and
   tunnels were used to investigate scaling effects: of solute transport
   processes in fractured rock. A series of tracer experiments using
   deuterium and dye tracers (uranine, eosine, and pyranine) were performed
   over varying distances and under different testing procedures, resulting
   in different flow field conditions, Large-scale tracer experiments (21
   to 346 m) were performed under natural Bow field conditions, while
   small-scale tracer experiments (11 to 16 m) were performed under
   artificially induced radial-convergent and injection-withdrawal now
   fields. The tracer concentration curves observed in all experiments were
   strongly influenced by the matrix diffusion. The curves were evaluated
   with the one-dimensional single fissure dispersion model (SFDM)
   (advective-dispersive transport in the fractures coupled with diffusive
   transport in the adjacent rock matric) adjusted for the different Bow
   field conditions. The fitting model parameters found determined the
   fracture aperture, and matrix and fissure porosities. The determined
   fracture aperture varied between the sections having different hydraulic
   conductivities (100 to 270 mu m and 430 to 580 mu m, respectively). The
   determined values of matrix porosity (3 to 7\%) seemed to be independent
   of the scale of the experiment. The modeled matrix porosities agreed
   well with values determined in independent laboratory investigations of
   drill cores using mercury porosimetry. In situ fissure porosity,
   determined only in small-scale experiments, was independent of the
   applied geometry of the artificially induced Bow fields. The
   dispersivities were found to be independent of the scale of experiment
   but dependent on the Bow conditions. The values found in forced gradient
   tests lie between 0.2 and 0.3 m, while values in experiments performed
   under natural flow conditions were one order of magnitude higher.}},

Abstract = {{Occurrences of CH4 in residential areas in the vicinity of the Beare
   Road landfill, Toronto, Canada, have raised public concern about
   potential off-site migration of CH4 from the landfill site. Carbon
   isotopic analysis of dissolved and gas phase CH4 at the Beare Road site,
   however, indicates that CH4 in the ground water systems in the vicinity
   of the landfill is related to naturally occurring microbial
   methanogenesis within these geologic units, rather than to contamination
   by landfill CH4. CH4 gas in the landfill and landfill cover has
   delta(13)C values (-60.2 +/- 0.9 parts per thousand) typical of
   microbially produced gas. Concentrations of CH4 (508 to 693 mu M) found
   in deep ground water in the Scarborough, Don, and Whitby Formations
   underlying the landfill are isotopically distinct from the landfill
   gases. They are isotopically and compositionally similar, however, to
   naturally occurring microbial CH4 identified in organic-rich glacial
   deposits throughout Ontario, The lack of any significant CH4
   concentrations or concentration gradients in the upper till zone between
   the landfill and the deep ground water aquifer is further evidence that
   no transport between the landfill and deep ground water is occurring.}},

Abstract = {{To establish geochemical tools for tracing the origin of ground water
   contamination, we examined the variations of Cl/Br and Cl/F (weight)
   ratios in (1) domestic waste water from the Dan Region Sewage
   Reclamation Project and from reservoirs in the central coast of Israel;
   (2) associated contaminated ground water; and (3) pristine ground water
   from the Mediterranean coastal aquifer of Israel. Our data show that
   supply water, anthropogenic NaCl and fluoridation control the Cl/Br (410
   to 873) and Cl/F (468 to 1070) ratios of domestic waste water, and
   conventional sewage treatment does not affect the anthropogenic
   inorganic signals, The Cl/Br ratios of ground water contaminated with
   sewage effluent reflect conservative mixing proportions of sewage and
   regional ground water components. Sensitivity tests demonstrate that it
   is possible to detect and distinguish sewage contamination from marine
   ratios after a sewage contribution of 5 to 15\% is mixed with regional
   ground water. Mixing,vith Br-enriched fresh water (e.g., Sea of Galilee;
   Cl/Br=145), however, would reduce this sensitivity, Since the high Cl/Br
   signal of sewage effluents is distinguishable from other anthropogenic
   sources with low Cl/Br ratios (e.g., street runoff, agriculture return
   flows) and from natural contamination sources (e.g., salt water
   intrusion; Cl/Br=293), Cl/Br ratios can therefore be a useful inorganic
   tracer for identification of the origin of contaminated ground water.
   The Cl/F ratios of sewage-contaminated ground water (284 to 5186) were
   higher than those in the original sewage effluent, which suggests
   retention of fluoride into the aquifer solid phase.}},

Abstract = {{Federal efforts to establish reliable natural disinfection criteria for
   ground water supplies require the identification of appropriate
   indicator viruses to represent pathogenic viruses and an understanding
   of parameters affecting virus survival and transport in a variety of
   hydrogeologic settings. A high school septic system and the associated
   fecal waste-impacted unconfined sand and gravel aquifer were
   instrumented to: (1) evaluate if the concentrations of enterovirus and
   coliphage in this system were sufficient to allow their use as indicator
   viruses; (2) establish viral transport rates, transport distances, and
   concentrations in a highly conductive cold water aquifer, Enteroviruses
   were found in only two of eight assays of the septic tank effluent (0.26
   and 4.4 virus/L) and were below detection in eight ground water samples.
   Male-specific and somatic coliphage were detectable in both the septic
   tank effluent (averaging 674,000 and 466,000 coliphage/L, respectively)
   and in the impacted underlying ground water, decreasing to detection
   limits beyond 38 m of the drainfield. Virus transport parameters in this
   aquifer were measured by seeding high numbers of MS2 and empty setX174
   coliphage into the ground water and documenting their transport over
   17.4 m, A portion of the seeded virus traveled at least as fast as the
   bromide tracer (1 to 2.9 m/d), Proposed natural disinfection criteria
   would not be met in this aquifer using standard 30.5 m setback
   distances. In addition, the virus sorption processes and long survival
   times resulted in presence of viable seed virus for more than nine
   months.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile sediment is a fundamental yet poorly characterized aspect of mass
   transport through karst aquifers. Here the development and field testing
   of an extremely sensitive particle tracer that may be used to
   characterize sediment transport in karst aquifers is described. The
   tracer consists of micron-size montmorillonite particles homoionized to
   the lanthanide form; after injection and retrieval from a ground water
   system, the lanthanide ions are chemically stripped from the clay and
   quantified by high performance liquid chromatography, The tracer meets
   the following desired criteria: low detection limit; a number of
   differentiable signatures; inexpensive production and quantification
   using standard methods; no environmental risks; and hydrodynamic
   properties similar to the in situ sediment it is designed to trace. The
   tracer was tested in laboratory batch experiments and field tested in
   both surface water and ground water systems. In surface water, arrival
   times of the tracer were similar to those of a conservative water
   tracer, although a significant amount of material was lost due to
   settling. Two tracer tests were undertaken in a karst aquifer under
   different flow conditions. Under normal flow conditions, the time of
   arrival and peak concentration of the tracer were similar to or preceded
   that of a conservative water tracer. Under low flow conditions, the
   particle tracer was not detected, suggesting that in low flow the
   sediment settles out of suspension and goes into storage.}},

Abstract = {{Computation of the well function is required in the analysis of pumping
   test data for leaky or confined aquifers. Existing electronic
   dataloggers facilitate collection of hydraulic test data, which is
   commonly interpreted using computer programs, Approximate expressions
   have recently been proposed to compute the well function over the entire
   range of argument values. We propose approximations that, while
   providing reasonable accuracy, are less computationally intensive than
   previous approximations. A detailed comparative analysis of the
   execution times and the errors of these approximations is performed, The
   proposed expressions are generally accurate to within 1\%, and result in
   a savings of computation time ran the order of 15 to 87\% for confined
   aquifers, and 29 to 76\% for leaky aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{In the glacial topography of southwestern Michigan,the water table does
   not always conform exactly to the land surface and flow-through
   wetlands, those with both ground water recharge and discharge, are
   common. The W-1 wetland in Cass County, Michigan, a flow-through system,
   shows a distinct contrast between upgradient and downgradient ground
   water quality, Ground water discharging into the wetland is oxic, has up
   to 40 mg/L NO3-N derived from fertilizer and hog manure application to
   corn fields, and has major ion concentrations typical of the shallow
   unconfined aquifer in the area. In contrast, shallow ground water that
   originates as recharge from the wetland forms a plume extending
   downgradient that can be identified by isotopic enrichment in O-18 and
   deuterium resulting from evaporation in the wetland prior to recharge
   and by distinct chemical characteristics similar to the wetland surface
   water (low conductivity and alkalinity, low concentrations of sulfate,
   nitrate and dissolved oxygen and high concentrations of ammonia, and
   DOG). As the wetland surface water infiltrates into the unconfined
   aquifer, conductivity and alkalinity increase due to carbonate mineral
   dissolution and iron concentrations increase as ferric iron in the
   aquifer solids serves as an electron acceptor in microbially mediated
   reactions. The other chemical characteristics, including the lack of
   nitrate, persist in the flow system for significant distances
   downgradient from the wetland.
   The chemical and isotopic composition of shallow ground water around
   wetlands can be used to spatially delineate areas of groundwater
   discharge to the wetland and ground water recharge from the
   wetland,thereby providing a supplemental method to the use of sometimes
   inconclusive hydraulic head data in the determination of wetland
   recharge-discharge function, In this study, the chemical and isotopic
   data confirm that the water table does not replicate surface topography
   around closed depressions in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Specific storage (S-s) was calculated for 107 glacial till core samples
   collected in 1962 from 93 drilling sites at U.S. Air Force
   Intercontinental Ballistic Missile launch and launch control facilities
   located in North Dakota. Core sample depths ranged from 8 to 26 m.
   Consolidation tests were performed on the till samples using a floating
   ring consolidometer. The coefficient of volume change (m(v)), which is
   defined as the volume change per unit volume per unit increase in
   effective stress, was calculated for this study using previously
   reported consolidation test data. S-s calculated for the 107 till
   samples ranged from 2.0 x 10(-4)m(-1) to 1.1x10(-3)m(-1), with a mean
   value of 5.6 x O(-4)m(-1).
   Till is easily compressible and, as a result, S-s is not constant, but
   rather a function of loading. With increased depth, effective stress
   (sigma(0)) increases and S-s decreases. Based on data from 107 till
   cores in this study, the relationship between sigma(o) and S-s, is
   described by: S-s = 0.049 sigma(0)(-0.84), (r(2) = 0.60, p<0.0001),
   where sigma(0) = in situ effective stress in kPa, and S-s = specific
   storage in m(-1).}},

Abstract = {{A series of air permeability tests were conducted on four hand-packed
   samples of alluvial sands and glass beads using a newly developed air
   permeameter, The permeameter was tested and found capable of precisely
   controlling soil-water matric potential (in the range 0 to 1 bar) while
   simultaneously facilitating the direct measurement of air permeability
   in porous media. Permeameter results indicate that air permeability
   increases with a corresponding decrease in water content over a
   monotonic drainage cycle. It was observed that the rate of change in air
   permeability with respect to changes in water content is highest at high
   water content and lowest at low water content. In several soil samples,
   the air permeability approached a constant value at low water content,
   Air permeability variations with water content were observed to differ
   among soils of different texture, For example, the intrinsic
   permeability of water was 11 to 86\% of the maximum air permeability,
   The new permeameter allowed rapid and accurate measurements of air
   permeability in fine-textured materials over a wide range of matric
   potentials and water content.}},

Abstract = {{As a well is pumped through time, concentrations of specific
   constituents in the water discharging from the well may change as a
   result of their transport within the well and the aquifer. A series of
   experiments conducted at a research site on Cape God,,Massachusetts,
   examined the effects of transport on the chemistry of water samples
   obtained from a long-screened well. Analyses of time series of
   constituent concentrations in water pumped from the long-screened web
   shelved persistent temporal trends during the first experiment. Iron
   concentrations decreased over a five-hour test (15 casing volumes),
   whereas the calcium and magnesium concentrations increased. In contrast,
   the time series of constituent concentrations of water discharging from
   the same wed showed less change with time during a later experiment,
   Numerical simulations were undertaken to test the relative importance of
   several possible factors affecting the temporal variations of these
   constituents, During the process of quantitatively explaining the
   changes in concentrations over time observed in the two experiments,
   different system conceptualizations were used, including (I) flow and
   transport in the aquifer without wellbore transport, (2) flow and
   transport in the aquifer with advective flow and transport in the
   wellbore, and (3) now and transport in the aquifer with advective flow
   and transport in the wellbore and a thin layer (skin) of water
   surrounding the well with constituent concentrations that had been
   altered by the presence of the well, The conjectured skin of wellbore
   water, which could have invaded the aquifer because of nearby sampling
   or dispersion and diffusion near the wellbore, in conjunction with non
   and transport in the aquifer and advective transport within the
   wellbore, produced a reasonable match between the simulated and observed
   concentrations, The data analysis confirms the known fact that
   long-screened wells provide mechanisms for the redistribution of
   chemical constituents in the aquifer, The analysis provides new insight
   into the mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in
   concentrations during the sampling of long-screened wells. The analysis
   quantifies the effects of the various conceptual models of now and
   transport in and around wells on the interpretation and meaning of
   chemical analyses of water withdrawn from long-screened wells.}},

Abstract = {{The steady-state ground water age distribution in the Rabis Creek
   Aquifer in Denmark is simulated directly and compared to the age
   estimated from observed tritium concentrations at three wells. The
   simulation code is based on an existing solute transport code, modified
   to include a zero-order rate term of unity to account for the aging of
   ground mater by one day per one day elapsed. The directly simulated ages
   of the observed tritium peaks agree to within less than four years with
   the observations. The tritium peaks would have been located to within 2
   m vertically if the directly simulated ages had been used to select
   sampling depths in the three wells. An analytical solution that assumes
   that the geology is uniform and rectangular is shown to be a useful tool
   as a firsthand estimate of the age distribution. However, ages from a
   numerical direct age simulation that account for nonuniform aquifer
   properties agree better with the observed ages.}},

Abstract = {{Contamination of shallow ground water by sewage effluent typically
   contains reduced chemical species that consume dissolved oxygen,
   developing either a low oxygen geochemical environment or an anaerobic
   geochemical environment. Based on the load of reduced chemical species
   discharged to shallow ground water and the amounts of reactants in the
   aquifer matrix, it should be possible to determine chemical processes in
   the aquifer and compare observed results to predicted ones.
   At the Otis Air Base research site (Cape God, Massachusetts) where
   sewage effluent has infiltrated the shallow aquifer since 1936,
   bacterially mediated processes such as nitrification, denitrification,
   manganese reduction, and iron reduction have been observed in the
   contaminant plume, In specific areas of the plume, dissolved manganese
   and iron have increased significantly where local geochemical conditions
   are favorable for reduction and transport of these constituents from the
   aquifer matrix, Dissolved manganese and iron concentrations ranged from
   0.02 to 7.3 mg/L, and 0.001 to 13.0 mg/L, respectively, for 21 samples
   collected from 1988 to 1989,
   Reduction of manganese and iron is linked to microbial oxidation of
   sewage carbon, producing bicarbonate and the dissolved metal ions as
   by-products. Calculated production and flux of CO2 through the
   unsaturated zone from manganese reduction in the aquifer was 0.035
   g/m(2)/d (12\% of measured CO2 flux during winter), Manganese is limited
   in the aquifer, however A one-dimensional, reaction-coupled transport
   model developed for the mildly reducing conditions in the sewage plume
   nearest the source beds showed that reduction, transport, and removal of
   manganese from the aquifer sediments should result in iron reduction
   where manganese has been depleted.}},

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to evaluate the distribution of radon
   (Rn-222) and the hydrogeologic controls on its occurrence in the glacial
   and fractured rock aquifers of the Pawcatuck River Basin, Rhode Island.
   a total of 91 ground water samples were collected and analyzed for major
   chemical constituents as well as uranium and Rn-222. The three bedrock
   types underlying the study area include the Proterozoic Esmond and
   Sterling gneisses, and the Devonian Scituate Granite, each having
   average uranium contents of 1.9 ppm, 3.3 ppm, and 4.1 ppm, respectively
   (Nevins 1991), All wells sampled in this study yielded radon levels
   above the proposed U.S. EPA limit of 300 pCi/L, Wells in areas underlain
   by the Esmond Suite had the lowest radon content (range 500 to 30,400
   pCi/L, median 1400 pCi/L), areas underlain by the Sterling Suite were
   not significantly different but showed slightly higher concentrations
   (range 700 to 27,300 pCi/L, median 1600 pCi/L), and the areas underlain
   by the Scituate Suite had significantly higher levels (range 1600 to
   83,500 pCi/L, median 5900 pCi/L), High fluoride and alkalinity
   concentrations in ground mater were found to be hydrogeochemical markers
   for elevated radon concentrations. These markers are believed to
   represent chemical reactions that produce remobilization of uranium in
   the host crystalline rock to more favorable siting along grain and
   fracture boundaries. Physical characteristics such as porosity and the
   location of uranium are controlling factors in the distribution of radon
   between surficial and bedrock webs, with bedrock aquifers exhibiting
   higher radon concentrations than surficial-materials aquifers in this
   basin.}},

Abstract = {{A ground water basin is defined as the volume of subsurface through
   which ground water flows from the water table to a specified discharge
   location. Delineating the topographically defined surface water basin
   and extending it vertically downward does not always define the ground
   water basin. Instead, a ground water basin is more appropriately
   delineated by tracking ground water flowpaths with a calibrated,
   three-dimensional ground water flow model. To determine hydrologic and
   chemical budgets of the basin, it is also necessary to quantify flow
   through each hydrogeologic unit in the basin, In particular,
   partitioning ground water now through unconsolidated deposits versus
   bedrock is of significant interest to hillslope hydrologic studies. To
   address these issues, a model is developed and calibrated to simulate
   ground water flow through glacial deposits and fractured crystalline
   bedrock in the vicinity of Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, Tracking of
   ground water flowpaths suggests that Mirror Lake and its inlet streams
   drain a ground water recharge area that is about 1.5 times the area of
   the surface water basin. Calculation of the ground water budget suggests
   that, of the recharge that enters the Mirror Lake ground water basin,
   about 40\% travels through the basin along flowpaths that stay
   exclusively in the glacial deposits, and about 60\% travels along
   flowpaths that involve movement in bedrock.}},

Abstract = {{Many small-scale ground water models are too small to incorporate
   distant aquifer boundaries. If a larger-scale model exists for the area
   of interest, flow and head values can be specified for boundaries in the

   components along rows and columns of a large-scale block-centered
   finite-difference model can be interpolated to compute horizontal flow
   across any segment of a perimeter of a small-scale model. Head at cell
   centers of the larger-scale model can be interpolated to compute head at
   points on a model perimeter. Simple linear interpolation is proposed for
   horizontal interpolation of horizontal-flow components. Bilinear
   interpolation is proposed for horizontal interpolation of head values.
   The methods of interpolation provided satisfactory boundary conditions

   hydrogeology to understand the sources and fate of ground water and
   contaminant pow, An investigation was conducted to define the watershed
   to Waquoit Bay, a shallow eutrophic coastal embayment at the margin of
   the sand and gravel aquifer of Cape God, Massachusetts. This
   investigation included: (1) the development of a subregional water table
   map over 56 square kilometers; (2) delineation of a watershed and
   subwatersheds by plotting reverse ground water flow.paths; (3) a water
   budget based on a mass balance between recharge rates over riverine
   watershed segments and measured stream flows; and (4) a series of web
   points driven beneath the bed of the embayment and a transect of deep
   geologic borings perpendicular to the shore to characterize submarine
   ground water and hydrogeologic conditions at depth. The principal
   aquifer thins from the apex of the watershed, where it is approximately
   46 m thick, to approximately 11.3 m thick as it nears Waquoit Bay The
   detailed water table map shoes extremely high hydraulic gradients to the
   rivers and comparably smaller gradients near the bay, indicating the
   thinning aquifer forces ground water to discharge into the rivers and
   causes them to function as significant surface drains for the aquifer,
   ii classic sharp salt water interface was found in the upper 11,3 m
   thick High Ii unit, while the Interface in the lower 34 m thick Low Ii
   unit was estimated to extend 700 m from the shoreline beneath the saline
   water of the bag: Eighty-nine percent (89\%) of the bag water budget is
   from ground water now (55\% channeled into rivers and 34\% direct ground
   water discharge), while 11\% is from atmospheric deposition. The Low K
   unit is an insignificant source of fresh mater to the embayment. The
   conceptual hydrogeologic model of the watershed is consistent with the
   water table configuration and the mass balance water budget and was
   confirmed by subsurface characterization of the near shore hydrogeology,
   This type of watershed characterization provides a firm basis for the
   development of nonpoint source management options for coastal
   embayments.}},

Abstract = {{Pore water solutes and sediments in the New Jersey Coastal Plain were
   studied to assess processes that control pore water chemistry in
   confining units and interactions with aquifer water chemistry. Solute
   chemistry and variations with depth are reported for 19 samples
   collected from a continuously cored borehole in the lower Miocene
   Kirkwood Formation at Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 14 pore water
   samples collected from the Lower Confining Unit overlying the Atlantic
   City 800-foot Sand, and from the silt interbeds in the Upper Part of the
   Atlantic City 800-foot Sand, linear regressions showed especially high
   correlations (R-2>0.89) between concentrations of Mg and Ca; between
   concentrations of Na and the sum of Ca and Mg; between concentrations of
   SO4 and the sum of Ca and Mg; and between concentrations of Na and SO4,
   There were three distinct water quality types: Ca-SO4,
   Ca-Na-SO4-Cl-HCO3, and Na-SO4-HCO3-Cl. Each water type generally is
   within distinct intervals (tens of meters), or hydrogeochemical facies,
   in the core. The first two facies were found only in the units overlying
   the Atlantic City 800-foot Sand; the third type was found only in
   samples from the underlying composite confining unit. Significant
   variation of pore water solute concentrations was indicated on a scale
   smaller than the sampling interval (about 3.5 m), Two principal
   components explained 82.5\% of the total variation in pore water
   chemistry The processes which control the variation in water quality
   include (1) chemical processes such as shell dissolution, incongruent
   carbonate dissolution, and clay transformations; (2) a hypothesized
   physical-chemical mechanism of differential migration of sulfate
   accompanied by divalent cations; and (3) fresh water flushing of, and
   mixing with, residual sea water at paleoflow rates, Cation-exchange
   reactions do not appear to be an important process in these sediments.}},

Abstract = {{A method to evaluate first-order and zero-order in situ reaction rates
   from a push-pull test is presented. A single-well push-pull test starts
   with the rapid injection of a well-mixed slug containing a known
   quantity of a conservative tracer and a reactive solute into the
   saturated zone, The slug is then periodically extracted and sampled from
   the same well. For zero- or first-order reactions, in the absence of
   sorption and assuming negligible background concentrations, these
   measurements can be used to evaluate reaction rate coefficients
   directly. The method does not involve computer-based solute transport
   models and requires no knowledge of regional ground water now or
   hydraulic parameters, The method performs well when the dominate
   processes are advection, dispersion, and zero- or first-order
   irreversible reactions. Regional now velocities must be sufficiently low
   such that the slug stays within the area of the well during the sampling
   phase, In the case of zero-order reactions, results using the method
   proposed here are compared with those obtained through the traditional
   method of calibrating a computer-based transport model. The two methods
   give similar estimates of the reaction rate coefficient, The method is
   general enough to work with a broad range of push-pull experiment
   designs and sampling techniques.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides the first experimental determination of the rates
   and distribution of transport of a dense, nonaqueous phase liquid
   (DNAPL) through a naturally bioporous and fractured clayey till deposit.
   Until now, assessment of DNAPL behavior in this type of deposit has
   relied on theoretical studies. Predictions of DNAPL transport have
   proven to be uncertain as a result of difficulties in measuring critical
   parameters such as DNAPL entry pressure and flow behavior in response to
   natural fracture/biopore apertures and the degree of interconnection of
   these structures, In the present investigation, the migration of free
   product trichloroethylene (TCE) was studied by means of two undisturbed
   clayey till columns (dimensions: 0.5 m diameter by 0.5 m long) under in
   situ effective soil stress conditions. The experiments revealed that
   transport of TCE was restricted to biopores in one column and fractures
   in another column, bypassing the low-permeability clayey matrix,
   Effective porosities of the columns, i.e., biopores and fractures, were
   two to three orders of magnitude lower than total porosities (25\% and
   32\%, respectively, for the two columns), i,e,, macropores and matrix,
   Single phase water flow rates through the columns at water-saturated
   conditions followed a linear relationship with hydraulic gradient, TCE
   now could not be predicted from the single-phase calculations because of
   nonlinearity observed between applied TCE injection heads and resulting
   TCE flow. TCE flow rates were 24 and 10.3 m/day at TCE gradients of 1.18
   and 0.91, respectively. The observed flow rates indicate that in cases
   where vertical biopores or fractures fully penetrate clayey till
   aquitards, a low-viscosity DNAPL (e.g., TCE) may quickly enter
   underlying aquifers, The experiments further indicate that 100 liters of
   a low-viscosity DNAPL are sufficient to contaminate approximately 25 to
   100 m(3) of till material because of the small effective porosity
   constituted by the biopores and fractures.}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations of tritium, helium isotopes, and neon have been
   measured in ground mater from a fractured bedrock aquifer in a densely
   populated suburban area near New York City, Samples were obtained from
   heavily pumped production wells of a regional water supply company.
   Helium and neon concentrations exceed the values for air-saturated
   water, which is explained by the addition of unfractionated atmospheric
   air, radiogenic helium, and tritiogenic He-3. The identification of the
   composition of these excess components allows reliable separation of the
   tritiogenic He-3 concentration, and hence the calculation of the
   H-3/He-3 ages of the ground water, Comparison of the combined tritium
   plus tritiogenic He-3 concentrations with the historical record of
   tritium input from precipitation confirms that the H-3/He-3 data are
   self-consistent and provides constraints on the degree of mixing or
   helium loss. The distribution of H-3/He-3 ages is related to the
   large-scale topography of the study area and the depth of the wells.
   Furthermore, correlations between the H-3/He-3 ages and concentrations
   of total dissolved solids and total CO2 show that the ages contain
   meaningful information related to the temporal changes of the ground
   water chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this paper is the characterization of three-dimensional
   hydraulic conductivity distributions using qualitative and quantitative
   geologic borehole data. We illustrate an approach that entails a
   three-step procedure, where lithologic information reported in the
   borehole logs is first classified into texture classes. Representative
   hydraulic conductivity values are then calculated for each texture class
   using a correlation relating measured lithologic and hydraulic data from
   core samples. The generalized kernel estimator method, which can take
   full advantage of the characteristics of borehole log data and is
   applicable to statistically nonstationary systems, is used thereafter to
   generate the three-dimensional distributions of hydraulic conductivity.
   An application using borehole data from a trichloroethene
   (TCE)-contaminated Superfund site in Tucson, Arizona, is presented and
   used to test the proposed methodology. The simulated hydraulic
   conductivity distributions appear reasonable and the simulated
   permeability distributions for several cross sections agree well with
   the hydrogeologic cross-sectional maps. The use of mean permeability
   indicators for differentiating zones of high and low permeability is
   also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{The Regional Municipality of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada (population
   250,000) depends on ground water for most of its water supply. The
   ground water is extracted from the Waterloo Moraine, an extensive and
   complex glacial aquifer system extending over a 400 km(2) area. A
   methodology is being developed to inventory the ground water resource,
   to define its susceptibility to contamination, and to create the basis
   for optimal management and protection strategies. A hey component of
   this methodology is a three-dimensional conceptual hydrogeologic model
   based on the geologic characteristics of the multiple-aquifer Moraine
   system. The steps in the development of the model include screening of
   the large database, interpretation and interpolation of the data to
   define the variable hydrostatigraphy and to generate consistent
   hydraulic conductivity functions, and model calibration. The numerical
   basis is a fully three-dimensional finite element model that provides
   flexibility and adaptability in representing the natural boundaries, the
   highly irregular stratigraphy, and the numerous wellfields. The model
   has the capability to automatically find the location of the water table
   consistent,vith given recharge and pumping conditions, and to direct
   recharge from low-permeability areas to higher-permeability areas,
   Capture zones generated by the model are found to be highly sensitive
   with respect to the geologic structure, in particular the presence or
   absence of,windows in the aquitard units. Professional judgment is found
   to be an essential component of the modeling process.}},

Abstract = {{Natural attenuation processes, such as biodegradation, may serve as a
   means for remediating ground water contaminated by fuel hydrocarbons
   from leaking underground fuel tanks (LUFTs), Quantification of the
   uncertainties associated with natural attenuation, and hence the
   capacity to limit plume migration and restore an aquifer, is important.
   In this study, a probabilistic screening model is developed to quantify
   uncertainties involved in the impact of biodegradation on hydrocarbon
   plume behavior. The approach is based on Monte Carlo simulation using an
   analytical solution to the advective-dispersive solute transport
   equation, including a first-order degradation term, coupled with mass
   balance constraints on electron acceptor use. Empirical probability
   distributions for governing parameters are provided as input to the
   model, Application of the model to an existing LUFT site illustrates the
   degree of uncertainty associated with model-predicted hydrocarbon
   concentrations and geochemical indicators at individual site monitoring
   wells as well as the roles of various parameter assumptions (e.g.,
   hydraulic conductivity, first-order decay coefficient, source term) in
   influencing forecasts. This information is useful for risk management
   planning because the degree of confidence that biodegradation will limit
   the impact of a hydrocarbon plume on potential receptors can be
   quantified.}},

Abstract = {{Aquifer storage recovery (ASR) was tested in the Santee Limestone/Black
   Mingo Aquifer near Charleston, South Carolina, to assess the feasibility
   for subsurface storage of treated drinking water. Water quality data
   obtained during two representative ASR tests were interpreted to show
   three things: (1) recovery efficiency of ASR in this geological setting;
   (2) possible changes in physical characteristics of the aquifer during
   ASR testing; and (3) water quality changes and potability of recovered
   water during short (one-and six-day) storage durations in the
   predominantly carbonate aquifer.
   Recovery efficiency for both ASR tests reported here was 54\%,
   Successive ASR tests increased aquifer permeability of the Santee
   Limestone/Black Mingo Aquifer, It is likely that aquifer permeability
   increased during short storage periods due to dissolution of carbonate
   minerals and amorphous silica in aquifer material by treated drinking
   water. Dissolution resulted in an estimated 0.3\% increase in pore
   volume of the permeable zones. Ground water composition generally
   evolved from a sodium-calcium bicarbonate water to a sodium chloride
   water during storage and recovery. After short duration, stored water
   can exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency maximum contaminant
   level (MCL) for chloride (250 mg/L), However, sulfate, fluoride, and
   trihalomethane concentrations remained below MCLs during storage and
   recovery.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{404-408}},

Abstract = {{One benefit of a coupled geochemistry/transport approach is that
   interactions between chemical constituents that can change the mobility
   of species (such as pH) can be treated explicitly, rather than lumping
   all of the geochemistry into a single term (i.e., the retardation
   factor). A two-tiered approach to modeling coupled
   geochemistry/transport is presented here, which allows a comparison of
   the results of different methods as well as better efficiency in
   modeling time, The codes ParSSim, a coupled transport code for
   supercomputers, and PHREEQC, an advective geochemistry code, were used
   to model Sr mobility under varying pH, The problem was based on liquid
   low level radioactive waste that was disposed at Oak Ridge National
   Laboratory (Oak Ridge, Tennessee) in a highly alkaline solution to try
   to enhance precipitation and sorption, Interactions with carbonate rock
   and ground water lowered the pH and led to mobilization of radionuclides
   such as Sr-90. Simulation of contaminant migration in this mixing
   environment requires a coupled geochemistry and transport model. The
   interplay between propagation of a pH front (which was retarded) and
   propagation of the Sr front leads to a fast-moving pulse of Sr as well
   as a strongly retarded front of Sr. This behavior could not have been
   predicted by a geochemistry or a transport code alone.}},

   transmissivity, which ranged from 0.3 to 24 m(2)/d and from 1 to 89
   m(2)/d in the lower and upper aquifer, respectively. Age indicators were
   used to calculate hydraulic conductivity values: those obtained using
   radiocarbon data (0.54 to 7.5 m/d and 0.4 to 4 m/d for the upper and
   lower aquifer, respectively) were one order of magnitude higher than
   those obtained by depletion curve interpretation (10(-3) -0.45 mid),
   renecting either the prevailing lower porosity (0.01) typical of the
   aquifers, or the impact of regional-vs. local-scale measurements. The
   higher values obtained using radiocarbon were still a sixth of that
   calculated from a single pumping test in the area (40 mid). The pumping
   test, however, is suggested to provide values which are too high because
   of leakage from adjacent formations during the test. The alternative
   techniques for parameter estimation presented here are recommended when
   pumping test data are lacking (while discharge and water level data do
   exist), or when regional rather than point transmissivity values are
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen isotope ratios of soil water and ground water nitrate have been
   used to identify or implicate sources; however, lack of data on
   delta(15)N in thick (>12 m) vadose zones beneath the source and
   potential effects of denitrification on delta(15)N signatures have
   raised questions about the meaning of delta(15)N values measured in
   ground water, In this study, nitrogen isotope ratios (delta(15)N) were
   measured on nitrate extracted from 218 core samples removed from the
   surface to the water table below natural (soil organic matter)
   fertilizer, onsite sewage disposal systems (septic tank effluent), and
   animal sources located in Salinas and Sacramento Valleys, California.
   Additionally, spatial variability of delta(15)N in the horizontal plane
   was measured beneath an agricultural field, and delta(15)N values of
   native geologic materials (organic-rich shales) were determined. In
   general, delta(15)N values throughout the vadose zone were consistent
   with the literature and remained fairly constant with depth, indicating
   little denitrification during transport. The delta(15)N values from soil
   organic matter sources varied from about 0 to +4 parts per thousand, and
   the mean was not significantly different from that of fertilizer
   sources. The delta(15)N values of animal sources varied from about +8 to
   +20 parts per thousand and were dependent on site and animal source. The
   delta(15)N of onsite sewage disposal sources varied from about +2 to +12
   parts per thousand, and the mean was significantly different from that
   of animal sources at a 90\% confidence level. delta(15)N Of organic-rich
   shales of the Panoche and Moreno Formations (Cretaceous; San Joaquin
   Valley) and soils derived from these rocks were generally between +4 and
   +8 parts per thousand, Thus, it may be difficult to distinguish a
   geologic-N source from septic tank or commercial fertilizer sources
   using delta(15)N. Little spatial variation was found in delta(15)N
   beneath the agricultural field in the horizontal plane.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of pumping test data for a shallow riverbank aquifer
   afforded the opportunity to compare standard methods for determining
   hydraulic conductivity (K) and storativity (S) with techniques based on
   the propagation of periodic fluctuations of head in the aquifer. Tidal
   fluctuations in water level at the riverbank were found to propagate
   approximately nondispersively for 200 m in the aquifer, allowing tidal
   phase lags and amplitude attenuations in the aquifer to be estimated
   from river levels by least-squares techniques. The least-squares
   attenuations and phases were used to correct measured pumping test
   drawdowns for tidal influences. Standard transient analyses of the
   corrected drawdowns were performed, yielding values of approximately 8
   to 10 m/d for K and 0.002 for S. The low S value was taken to indicate
   semi-confined conditions. The tidal attenuation coefficients were used
   to determine the hydraulic diffusivity T/S, providing values that were
   integrated over the distance from the riverbank to the relevant
   monitoring wells. S values from the drawdown analyses then yielded K
   estimates ranging from 3 to 7 mid. A three-dimensional finite-element
   simulation of the pumping tests showed that the estimated K and S values
   yielded simulated drawdowns in reasonable agreement with field
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands cannot exist without water, but wetland hydrology is difficult
   to characterize. As a result, compensatory wetland mitigation often only
   assumes the proper hydrology has been created. In this study, water
   sources and mass transfer processes in a natural and constructed wetland
   complex were investigated using isotopes of water and strontium, Water
   isotope profiles in the saturated zone revealed that the natural wetland
   and one site in the constructed wetland were primarily fed by ground
   water; profiles in another constructed wetland site showed recent rain
   was the predominant source of water in the root zone. Water isotopes in
   the capillary fringe indicated that the residence time for rain is less
   in the natural wetland than in the constructed wetland, thus
   transpiration (an important water sink) was greater in the natural
   wetland, Strontium isotopes showed a systematic difference between the
   natural and constructed wetlands that we attribute to the presence or
   absence of peat, In the peat-rich natural wetland, delta(87)Sr in the
   pore water increased along the flowline due to preferential weathering
   of minerals containing radiogenic Sr in response to elevated Fe
   concentrations in the water, In the constructed wetland, where peat
   thickness was thin and Fe concentrations in water were negligible,
   delta(87)Sr did not increase along the flowline, The source of the peat
   (on-site or off-site derived) applied in the constructed wetland
   controlled the delta(87)Sr, but the top of the profile, but the effects
   were restricted by strong cation exchange in the underlying fluvial
   sediments. Based on the results of this study, neither constructed
   wetland site duplicated the water source and weathering environment of
   the adjoining natural wetland. Moreover, stable isotopes were shown to
   be effective tools for investigating wetlands and gaining insight not
   easily obtained using non-isotopic techniques. These tools have
   potential widespread application to wetlands that have distinct isotopic
   endmember sources.}},

Abstract = {{A new methodology was developed for the in situ investigation of flow
   and transport processes through undisturbed, discrete fractures in the
   vadose zone. The experimental setup and technical means were designed
   for a scale of several meters, larger than any conceivable laboratory
   experiment. The setup consists of four components: (1) a 25 cm diameter
   horizontal borehole is core-drilled along a vertical, discrete fracture
   plane, exposing the fracture at the borehole ceiling; (2) compartmental
   ponds are installed along the traced fracture on the horizontal part of
   the outcrop, Each compartment (25 cm long) is connected to a separate
   feeding source, which can be tagged by a different tracer, and the water
   head is electronically controlled. Thus, each segment of the exposed
   fracture could be subjected to a different flux with a specific tracer
   under a constant hydraulic head; (3) a compartmental sampler, divided
   into 20 cm long cells, is installed beneath the compartmental ponds in
   the horizontal borehole, The effluent draining from a particular
   fracture segment is collected by individual cells of the sampler; (4)
   the percolating fluids accumulating in the various sampler cells are
   frequently drained by a collection system into individual sampling
   vessels.
   This experimental setup was field-tested with untagged water in
   preliminary experiments in fractured chalk. It can provide unique and
   important information about flowpath distributions along a natural
   fracture, and about the chemical evolution of the solutions percolating
   through the fractures.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the degree to which climate-induced
   changes in hydraulic head can affect the stress regime and hydraulic
   conductivity of fractured aquifers, The effects of stress changes on
   conductivity are well-known, but nob usually considered in the analysis
   of ground water systems because of the misconception that the head
   change necessary to make a measurable impact is beyond the range of
   normal head fluctuations.
   An empirical model relating changes in hydraulic conductivity of
   fractured aquifers to vertical-effective stress was used in analyzing
   the effects of pore pressure changes on conductivity. An analysis showed
   that for realistic head changes (20 to 100 m), conductivity in an
   unconfined system can change as much as 20 to 30\%, The analysis also
   showed that for a given head increase, increases in conductivity are
   greatest at shallow depths and that conductivity is a function of both
   hydraulic head and the relative position of head to the land surface.
   Maximum conductivity changes occur when the initial pore pressure is a
   relatively large percentage of the total stress. Similar results were
   also obtained in confined systems.
   Field examples demonstrate that large head changes have occurred in
   bedrock aquifers due to climatic changes and pumping withdrawals, Thus,
   large head changes needed to make a measurable impact on hydraulic
   conductivity are quite plausible. Conductivity changes can in turn lead
   to changes in calculated ground water flow and solute transport rates.
   As a result, when significant head changes are expected, changes in
   conductivity should be considered in the analysis of fractured aquifer
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{An extension of the least squares method given by Neuman et al. (1984)
   for estimating aquifer parameters is presented, and statistical tests
   for anisotropy are derived. Methods are also given to construct variance
   formulas for the principal axes of transmissivity and confidence
   intervals for the angles of orientation. The techniques developed here
   treat each monitoring well as the experimental unit, in contrast to
   inverse modeling methods which treat each time step for each well as the
   experimental unit. We argue that the latter is a form of
   pseudo-replication in that the number of time steps may be arbitrarily
   selected.
   The example aquifer test data used by Neuman et al. (1984) are analyzed.
   The maximum transmissiviy was found to have a magnitude of 8.60 +/- 5.30
   m(2)/day oriented N29.6 degrees W +/- 11.3 degrees at the 95\%
   confidence level with a ratio of anisotropy of 1.91 +/- 0.39. Both
   statistical tests indicated anisotropy. Results from a multiple well
   pumping test from the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, are also analyzed,
   The maximum transmissivity was found to have a magnitude of 230 m(2)/day
   +/- 84.4 m(2)/day oriented N51.7 degrees W +/- 5.3 degrees at the 95\%
   confidence level with a ratio of anisotropy of 2.12 +/- 0.48. Both
   statistical tests indicated anisotropy.
   The methods given in this paper can be performed with standard
   statistical software packages and spreadsheets. A program that uses
   Matlab(R) software is available from the authors to perform the
   necessary calculations at

Abstract = {{The performance of parametric models used to describe soil water
   retention (SWR) properties and predict unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K) as a function of volumetric water content (theta) is
   examined using SWR and K(theta) data for coarse sand and gravel
   sediments, Six 70 cm long, 10 cm diameter cores of glacial outwash were
   instrumented at eight depths with porous cup tensiometers and time
   domain reflectometry probes to measure soil water pressure head (h) and
   theta, respectively, for seven unsaturated and one saturated
   steady-state floww conditions, Forty-two theta(h) and K(theta)
   relationships were measured from the infiltration tests on the cores. Of
   the four SWR models compared in the analysis, the van Genuchten (1980)
   equation with parameters m and n restricted according to the Mualem (m =
   1 -1/n) criterion is best suited to describe the theta(h) relationships.
   The accuracy of two models that predict K(theta) using parameter values
   derived from the SWR models was also evaluated. The model developed by
   van Genuchten (1980) based on the theoretical expression of Mualem
   (1976) predicted K(theta) more accurately than the van Genuchten (1980)
   model based on the theory of Burdine (1953). A sensitivity analysis
   shows that more accurate predictions of K(theta) are achieved using SWR
   model parameters derived,vith residual mater content (theta(r))
   specified according to independent measurements of theta at values of h
   where partial derivative theta/partial derivative h approximate to 0
   rather than model-fit theta(r) values. The accuracy of the model
   K(theta) function improves markedly when at least one value of
   unsaturated K is used to scale the K(theta) function predicted using the
   saturated K, The results of this investigation indicate that the
   hydraulic properties of coarse-grained sediments can be accurately
   described using the parametric models. In addition, data collection
   efforts should focus on measuring at least one value of unsaturated
   hydraulic conductivity and as complete a set of SWR data as possible,
   particularly in the dry range.}},

   developed to assist in identifying salt water vulnerable areas and in
   developing management policies to prevent salt water intrusion in
   central Kansas. The DSS is based on a combination of numerical modeling
   sensitivity analyses, multiple regression analyses, and classification
   procedures derived from our knowledge of the area. Six ground water
   salinity models are proposed to evaluate irrigation well permit
   applications. The choice of model depends on the availability of
   site-specific data. The DSS takes advantage of GIS database management
   procedures, and is applied to an actual salt water intrusion problem
   site in south-central Kansas. This approach can help local ground water
   management districts make better decisions on protecting ground water
   use in salt water vulnerable areas.}},

Abstract = {{The in situ measurement of water flow and chemical transport through
   claypan soils is crucial to understanding potential water contamination
   from agricultural sources, It is important due to the large areal extent
   of these soils in agricultural regions of the midwestern United States
   and because of preferential flowpaths caused by desiccation cracks, worm
   burrowing, and root development. A study plot at the Missouri Management
   Systems Evaluation Area near Centralia, Missouri, was instrumented to
   determine the rate of preferential flow of water and transport of NO3-1
   fertilizer in the unsaturated zone through a claypan soil using
   N-15-NO3-1 and Br-l tracers. The areal distribution of preferential
   flowpaths was between 2 and 20\% in the topsoil, Gravity lysimeter now
   caused by preferential flow through the claypan was as much as 150 times
   greater than the estimated average rate of vertical recharge. As much as
   2.4\% of the volume of the soil below the claypan may be occupied by
   preferential flowpaths,
   The N-15-NO3-1 concentrations in ground water indicate that substantial
   quantities of fertilizer-derived NO3-1 were transported to ground water
   through the claypan during the first recharge event following fertilizer
   application even though that event occurred six months after
   application. Hydraulic conductivity, measured at three scales, ranged
   from 6.2 x 10(-8) to 7.5 x 10(-3) cm/s. The observed increase of
   calculated hydraulic conductivity with each increase in scale was
   attributed to the inclusion of more and larger preferential flowpaths
   within the volume over which the measurement was made, indicating
   hydraulic conductivity measured at one scale may not describe flow and
   transport at another scale.}},

Abstract = {{The use of surface-active tracers for measuring the interfacial area
   between nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) and water was evaluated in a
   hydraulically isolated test cell installed in a surficial aquifer
   located at Hill Air Force Base (AFB), Utah. Interfacial tracers mere
   developed at the University of Florida for quantifying immiscible
   fluid-fluid interfaces (air-water or NAPL-water) in porous media. Sodium
   dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) was used as the interfacial tracer to
   measure the effective NAPL-water interfacial area (a(Nw)), while
   2,2-dimethyl-3-pentanol (DMP) was used as the partitioning tracer to
   estimate the NAPL saturation (S-N). The observed retardation of SDBS and
   DMP when compared to a nonreactive tracer (bromide or methanol) at eight
   multilevel sampling locations and one extraction well, was used to
   quantify the a(Nw) and S-N values averaged over the interval between the
   injection wells and each monitoring point. The NAPL morphology index,
   defined here as H-N = a(Nw)/phi S-N (phi = porosity), varied
   significantly within the test cell. In locations where the magnitude of
   H-N was large, the NAPL was assumed to be more or less uniformly spread,
   providing good contact with the mobile fluid, In contrast, regions with
   low H-N values were assumed to have NAPL that was more heterogeneously
   distributed as isolated patches providing poor contact with the mobile
   fluid. The index H-N, provided by the combined use of interfacial and
   partitioning tracers, has important implications for NAPL source region
   remediation employing in situ flushing technologies.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Management of the limited fresh water resources on small oceanic islands
   has become critical with increasing population and development in
   coastal areas. Canals, dredged for Waterfront property and boat access,
   penetrate water bearing material and accelerate the natural discharge
   from fresh water lenses, Big Pine Key, located in the southern portion
   of the Florida Keys, is a heterogeneous, two-layer island with several
   canal networks, The island is approximately 3 km wide and 10 km long,
   The upper hydrostratigraphic unit (Miami Oolite Limestone) has a
   hydraulic conductivity of 100 meters per day (m/day), The lower unit
   (Key Large Limestone) has a hydraulic conductivity of 1200 m/day,
   To quantify the effects of canals on the fresh water lens of Big Pine
   Key, a numerical model was developed using the Dupuit and
   Ghyben-Herzberg assumptions. The thickness of the fresh water lens is
   sensitive to the location of the boundary between the upper and lower
   hydrostratigraphic layers, A simulation of present-day Big Pine Key,
   including canals, compared with predevelopment conditions shows that the
   total volume of the lens has decreased by 20\% in response to the
   dredgjng of canals. As dredging of canals will certainly continue in the
   future, the numerical model was also used to investigate the types of
   canals that are most detrimental to a fresh water lens, For an island 3
   km wide and 10 km long, a canal that penetrates 2 km lengthwise into the
   island reduces the volume of the fresh water lens by 6.5\%, For the same
   island dimensions, a canal that penetrates 2 km through the midsection
   of the island reduces the volume of the fresh water lens by 7.1\%.
   several short canals, with a combined total length of 2 km decrease the
   volume of the fresh water lens by 4.0\%. The deeper the penetration of
   the canal into the lens, the greater the influence of the canal,
   Therefore, several short canals are preferred over one long canal
   because shorter canals have less of an effect on the total volume of the
   fresh water lens, Canals also focus ground water discharge. The three
   configurations of 2000 m long canals each discharge 13 to 15\% of the
   total recharge to the island.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an effective semianalytical method for computation
   of ground water velocities near a partially penetrating well in an
   unconfined aquifer. The Neuman solution (1974) is presented as the sum
   of the Hantush solution (1964) and a correction term for water table
   conditions. Hydraulic gradients are directly evaluated from the Hantush
   solution, whereas the gradients for the Neuman correction are calculated
   using a numerical inversion of the Laplace transform, The method
   presented here is verified by comparing it with the results of a
   finite-difference approximation of hydraulic gradients. Calculations of
   velocities near a pumping well in an unconfined aquifer indicate that,
   after an initial increase, the vertical velocity decreases before
   reaching steady state. The method provides a useful tool for the study
   of well hydraulics and contaminant transport to a pumping well in an
   unconfined aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear regression was introduced to ground water modeling in the
   1970s, but has been used very little to calibrate numerical models of
   complicated ground water systems. Apparently, nonlinear regression is
   thought by many to be incapable of addressing such complex problems,
   With what we believe to be the most complicated synthetic test case used
   for such a study, this work investigates using nonlinear regression in
   ground water model calibration. Results of the study fall into two
   categories, First, the study demonstrates how systematic use of a well
   designed nonlinear regression method can indicate the importance of
   different types of data and can lead to successive improvement of models
   and their parameterizations. Our method differs from previous methods
   presented in the ground water literature in that (1) weighting is more
   closely related to expected data errors than is usually the case; (2)
   defined diagnostic statistics allow for more effective evaluation of the
   available data, the model, and their interaction; and (3) prior
   information is used more cautiously. Second, our results challenge some
   commonly held beliefs about model calibration. For the test case
   considered, we show that (1) field measured values of hydraulic
   conductivity are not as directly applicable to models as their use in
   some geostatistical methods imply; (2) a unique model does not
   necessarily need to be identified to obtain accurate predictions; and
   (3) in the absence of obvious model bias, model error was normally
   distributed. The complexity of the test case involved implies that the
   methods used and conclusions drawn are likely to be powerful in
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a nonsteady coupled aquifer solution in which
   transient and steady-state drawdowns due to pumping can be calculated in
   one or both of two aquifers separated by a semipermeable confining unit
   in a confined aquifer system. The water pumped is obtained from storage
   in the aquifers and the confining unit, and a reduction in
   evapotranspiration (ET) due to a decline in the water table. This
   solution is different from existing analytical solutions in that it
   includes both confining unit storage and a drawdown-dependent ET
   reduction term. A Laplace space solution obtained for the differential
   equations subject to the initial and boundary conditions is inverted to
   the time domain using the Stehfest numerical algorithm. The presence of
   the ET reduction term in the solution allows the drawdowns to reach a
   steady-state condition, and the presence of the confining unit storage
   term delays the response of the aquifer system to pumping, particularly
   in the unpumped aquifer. Use of the solution to calculate drawdowns for
   a representative field case is illustrated, along with verification of
   the solution using a numerical ground water flow model.}},

   oxygen and hydrocarbons are consumed by microorganisms, are represented
   by Monod kinetics, solved using a Runge-Kutta method. Model simulations
   showed good correlation as compared with results of soil column

Abstract = {{Conducting and interpreting slug tests in wells with screen sections and
   sand packs that span the water table are severely complicated by sand
   pack drainage and resaturation. Sand pack drainage greatly reduces the
   actual head difference between the well and the formation. Resaturation
   of the drained sand pack must be properly accounted for, or the
   formation hydraulic conductivity will be underestimated. The magnitude
   of error is a function of the well geometry, sand pack properties, and
   the model chosen to interpret the data. A method has been developed to
   correct for sand pack resaturation by calculating the specific yield of
   a drained sand pack using the early recharge data of a slug test. Slug
   tests were conducted in one well in which the water table varied over
   time, creating both partially and fully submerged screen and sand pack
   conditions for comparative testing. The mid-time, log-linear portion of
   slug test data was corrected using the calculated specific yield of the
   drained sand pack to yield essentially the same hydraulic conductivity
   value as the fully submerged screen results. Not accounting for sand
   pack resaturation would have yielded a hydraulic conductivity value that
   was lower than the submerged screen results by a factor of seven.}},

Abstract = {{This study deals with the problem of model structure identification when

   four identification criteria, recommended by Carrera and Neuman (1986a),
   to a synthetic model and to a set of field data from the Taegu area,
   Korea. Study of the synthetic model demonstrates that the quality of
   head data, the depth of data acquisition, and the anisotropy ratio of
   parameters are important factors for the parameter structure when it is
   identified using the four criteria. It also shows that a specific
   criterion is not preferable for every case, but that all four criteria
   should be considered in order to choose the best among a set of
   alternative aquifer zonation models. The field example shows that the
   anisotropy of aquifer parameters should be considered for the
   parameterization of crystalline rock aquifers, which are the most common
   systems in Korea.}},

Abstract = {{The stable isotopes of the conservative element boron, B-11 and B-10,
   have been employed as co-migrating isotopic tracers to trace potential
   sources of nitrate observed in ground water pumped from a large capacity
   0.167 m(3)/s irrigation well in the Avra Valley of southeastern Arizona.
   The isotopic ratios provided an identifying signature for two nitrogen
   carrying source waters: municipal waste water and agricultural return
   flow. Additional chemical parameters were also examined to corroborate
   the isotopic indications.
   Boron isotopes provided a superior delineation of mixing processes in
   the system compared to the general inorganic chemical parameters.
   Findings of this investigation indicate that the water pumped by the
   study well at the beginning of the 1993 irrigation season was composed
   of a mixture of approximately 25\% municipal waste water and 75\%
   background ground water. As the irrigation season progressed, an
   increasing proportion of water was contributed by irrigation return flow
   from neighboring agricultural fields.}},

Abstract = {{Ground water was sampled from a number of wells along recharge pathways
   between fractured shale and karstic carbonate formations to determine
   the effect of sampling methods on the colloid abundance and the chemical
   and hydrologic mechanisms controlling the abundance of ground water
   colloids. Low-flow minimal drawdown purging and sampling produced
   samples with much lower and more consistent turbidity than had been
   obtained during compliance monitoring of the same wells using much
   higher now rates and purging of three well volumes. Although some
   low-yielding wells required very low pumping rates (10 ml/min) to
   prevent drawdown, water quality parameters (temperature, pH, electrode
   potential, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, and turbidity)
   stabilized fairly quickly. The total volume of water removed during
   purging was small (usually only a few liters), and did not appear to be
   related to either the casing volume or the screen volume of the well.
   This lack of correlation may indicate that a limited volume of the
   formation is sampled at the low flow rates. Since only a portion of long
   screened intervals appear to be sampled, care must be given to placement
   of the sample tubing to access zones where contaminant migration is
   expected.}},

Title = {{A comparison of zero-order, first-order, and Monod biotransformation

Abstract = {{Under some conditions, a first-order kinetic model is a poor
   representation of biodegradation in contaminated aquifers, Although it
   is well known that the assumption of first-order kinetics is valid only
   when substrate concentration, S, is much less than the half-saturation
   constant, K-S, this assumption is often made without verification of
   this condition. We present a formal error analysis showing that the
   relative error in the first-order approximation is S/K-S and in the
   zero-order approximation the error is K-S/S. We then examine the
   problems that arise when the first-order approximation is used outside
   the range for which it is valid. A series of numerical simulations
   comparing results of first-and zero-order rate approximations to Monod
   kinetics for a real data set illustrates that if concentrations observed
   in the field are higher than K-S, it may be better to model degradation
   using a zero-order rate expression. Compared with Monod kinetics,
   extrapolation of a first-order rate to lower concentrations
   under-predicts the biotransformation potential, while extrapolation to
   higher concentrations may grossly over-predict the transformation rate.
   A summary of solubilities and Monod parameters for aerobic benzene,
   toluene, and xylene (BTX) degradation shows that the a priori assumption
   of first-order degradation kinetics at sites contaminated with these
   compounds is not valid. In particular, out of six published values of
   K-S for toluene, only one is greater than 2 mg/L, indicating that when
   toluene is present in concentrations greater than about a part per
   million, the assumption of first-order kinetics may be invalid. Finally,
   we apply an existing analytical solution for steady-state
   one-dimensional advective transport with Monod degradation kinetics to
   afield data set.}},

Abstract = {{In many hard rock lithologies, the distribution of borehole yields can
   often be regarded as being derived from a log-normally distributed
   population, characterized by the median yield (m(1)), and standard
   deviation of ln-transformed values (sigma(1)). By means of numerical
   techniques using standard spreadsheet software, the distribution of
   total yield from two or more boreholes can be calculated, assuming that
   the yields of the boreholes are statistically independent variables and
   that there is no significant hydraulic interference between boreholes.
   The results are not necessarily obvious: (1) the median total yield for
   a group of y noninterfering boreholes (m(y)) is greater than y.m(1). The
   ratio m(y)/y.m(1) increases with increasing y and with increasing
   sigma(1); and (2) the standard deviation sigma(1) of ln-transformed
   yield distributions for water systems consisting of y multiple boreholes
   is less than the standard deviation sigma(1) of the ln-transformed yield
   distribution far single boreholes. The standard deviation decreases as
   the number of boreholes in the group increases.}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{This study examines the effectiveness of various waterflooding
   strategies to recover pooled dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) from
   the subsurface at an industrial facility. The relative influence of
   horizontal injection/recovery well configuration, established hydraulic
   gradient, and fluid properties is investigated for a site characterized
   by a homogeneous silty sand underlain by an impermeable clay layer. The
   top of the clay layer is located 5 m below the water table and supports
   a laterally extensive 2 m deep DNAPL pool. The sensitivity study employs
   a two-phase flow numerical model that simulates both DNAPL infiltration
   and redistribution, including the formation of immobilized DNAPL
   residual. This is accomplished with constitutive relations featuring
   hysteretic capillary pressure-saturation pathways in which the local
   amount of residual formed is a function of the maximum nonwetting
   saturation attained during infiltration. Sixteen simulations, performed
   in two-dimensional vertical cross-section, demonstrate that strategies
   effecting increased wetting phase gradients, namely increasing drawdown
   at the recovery drain, adding injection wells, and reducing their
   distance to the recovery drain, result in an increased DNAPL volume
   recovered with time at the expense of increased volumes of ground water
   removed per unit volume of DNAPL recovered. Strategies which do not
   increase wetting phase gradients result in DNAPL recovery with a minimum
   volume of produced contaminated ground water. Three pulsed pumping
   simulations indicate that increasing the length of pump shut-down time
   decreases the recovery of DNAPL with time but increases efficiency with
   respect to ground water pumped. Decreased nonwetting density and
   increased interfacial tension result in poorer DNAPL recovery with
   respect to both time and volume of ground water removed, while reduced
   nonwetting viscosity corresponds to dramatically increased efficiency in
   both respects.}},

Abstract = {{A method is presented for determining the transmissivity, storage
   coefficient, and vertical anisotropy ratio of a confined aquifer using
   constant rate pumping test data obtained from a system of partially
   penetrating wells. The vertical anisotropy ratio is defined as the ratio
   of vertical to horizontal hydraulic conductivity. Knowing the anisotropy
   ratio is essential for computing drawdown and capture zones around
   partially penetrating pumping structures such as vertical wells,
   horizontal wells, or trenches.
   In the method, drawdown data obtained from the observation wells are
   corrected for partial penetration using the Hantush equation and
   analyzed using conventional distance-drawdown methods. Because the
   correction is dependent on knowing the aquifer coefficients, an
   iterative procedure is used in which each successive iteration improves
   on the estimates of transmissivity, storage coefficient and, ultimately,
   the vertical anisotropy ratio. Computer calculations are used to
   determine the drawdown correction factors but graphical methods are used
   to determine the aquifer coefficients so that the analyst can judge the
   quality of the data fit and become aware of any anomalies that may
   exist. Although no mathematical proof is offered herein, the iterative
   procedure in practice has always converged to produce a unique solution
   for the vertical anisotropy ratio. Based on the author's experience,
   accurate determination of the aquifer coefficients can be obtained when
   both deep and shallow observation wells are available.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{In most field investigations, information about hydraulic conductivity
   (K) is obtained through pumping or slug tests. A considerable body of
   data has been amassed that indicates that the K estimate from a pumping
   test is, on average, considerably larger than the estimate obtained from
   a series of slug tests in the same formation. Although these data could
   be interpreted as indicating a natural underlying scale dependence in K,
   an alternate explanation is that the slug-test K is artificially low as
   a result of incomplete well development and, to a much lesser extent,
   failure to account for vertical anisotropy. Incomplete well development
   will often result in only the most permeable zones being cleared of
   drilling debris, with much of the screened interval remaining
   undeveloped. More cursory development can leave a low-K skin along the
   entire screened interval. Failure to recognize such conditions can
   result in a K estimate from a slug test that is much lower than the
   average K of the formation in the vicinity of the well. By contrast,
   neither a skin nor vertical anisotropy will have a significant impact on
   K estimates from pumping tests when semi-log analyses and/or observation
   wells are used. However, a reasonable estimate of aquifer thickness is
   required to convert the transmissivity calculated from a pumping test
   into an average K for the aquifer. Prior to invoking a natural scale
   dependence to explain the results of different types of hydraulic tests,
   head data should be closely examined and serious consideration given to
   alternate explanations.}},

Title = {{Simplified method of ``push-pull{''} test data analysis for determining
   in situ reaction rate coefficients}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The single-well, ``push-pull{''} test method is useful for obtaining
   information on a wide variety of aquifer physical, chemical, and
   microbiological characteristics. A push-pull test consists of the
   pulse-type injection of a prepared test solution into a single
   monitoring well followed by the extraction of the test solution/ground
   water mixture from the same well. The test solution contains a
   conservative tracer and one or more reactants selected to investigate a
   particular process. During the extraction phase, the concentrations of
   tracer, reactants, and possible reaction products are measured to obtain
   breakthrough curves for all solutes. This paper presents a simplified
   method of data analysis that can be used to estimate a first-order
   reaction rate coefficient from these breakthrough curves. Rate
   coefficients are obtained by fitting a regression line to a plot of
   normalized concentrations versus elapsed time, requiring no knowledge of
   aquifer porosity, dispersivity, or hydraulic conductivity. A
   semi-analytical solution to the advective-dispersion equation is derived
   and used in a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the ability of the
   simplified method to estimate reaction rate coefficients in simulated
   push-pull tests in a homogeneous, confined aquifer with a
   fully-penetrating injection/extraction well and varying porosity,
   dispersivity, test duration, and reaction rate. A numerical flow and
   transport code (SUTRA) is used to evaluate the ability of the simplified
   method to estimate reaction rate coefficients in simulated push-pull
   tests in a heterogeneous, unconfined aquifer with a partially
   penetrating well. In all cases the simplified method provides accurate
   estimates of reaction rate coefficients; estimation errors ranged from
   0.1 to 8.9\% with most errors less than 5\%. In an example application,
   the method is used to estimate reaction rate coefficients for a
   microbiological process (denitrification) using data from field
   push-pull tests performed in a petroleum-contaminated, unconfined
   alluvial aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the near-field flow regime influencing the chemical
   composition of water samples collected from an irrigation well during
   short pumping periods. Data on the radial and vertical distribution of
   nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and on drawdown were collected from a closely
   spaced multi-level monitoring well network installed around an
   irrigation well. Aquifer properties were determined from grain-size
   analyses performed on samples collected from test holes drilled around
   the irrigation well and from drawdown data using the method of Neuman
   (1974). Grain-size characteristics were determined from cumulative
   distribution curves and used to construct vertical hydraulic
   conductivity (K) profiles based on frequently used empirical formulas
   applied to grain-size data for the determination of aquifer properties.
   Resultant vertical profiles show a general increase in K with depth.
   Results from the analysis of drawdown curves support the general trend
   of K determined from the grain-size data, drawdown-based K values,
   however, were 1.5 to 2 times greater than those determined from the
   empirical methods.
   Results from four pump-and-sample experiments at different times during
   the irrigation season indicate: (1) the distribution of NO3-N around the
   irrigation well is complex and variable over time and space; (2) shapes
   of concentration-time curves for individual sample points are governed
   by the initial contaminant distribution, and shapes of
   concentration-time curves for the pumping well are governed by variables
   such as well screen position and hydrogeologic properties; (3)
   irrigation well samples underestimate the highest, as wed as the average
   NO3-N concentrations within the aquifer; and (4) a sampling strategy
   based on the behavioral characteristics of the well as reflected in
   concentration-time curves can improve the interpretation of water
   quality data collected from high-capacity wells.}},

Abstract = {{In natural ground water systems, both chlorine and bromine occur
   primarily as monovalent anions, chloride and bromide. Although
   dissolution or precipitation of halite, biological activity in the root
   zone, anion sorption, and exchange can affect chloride/bromide ratios in
   some settings, movement of the ions in potable ground water is most
   often conservative. Atmospheric precipitation will generally have mass
   ratios between 50 and 150; shallow ground water, between 100 and 200;
   domestic sewage, between 300 and 600; water affected by dissolution of
   halite, between 1000 and 10,000; and summer runoff from urban streets,
   between 10 and 100. These, and other distinctive elemental ratios, are
   useful in the reconstruction of the origin and movement of ground water,
   as illustrated by case studies investigating sources of salinity in
   ground water from Alberta, Kansas, and Arizona, and infiltration rates
   and pathways at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.}},

Abstract = {{Database information on geology, hydrology, and hydrometeorology may
   form an excellent basis for studying ground water flow and seepage to
   surface water in a catchment. In a field case study of a 114 km(2)
   catchment, geological database information was used to determine layer
   thicknesses and boundary conditions as well as to parameterize a ground
   water flow model. Hydraulic head and stream flow data were used to
   estimate the model parameters by nonlinear regression. The uncertainty
   of the estimated parameters and of the predicted stream flow gains was
   quantified by individual likelihood method confidence intervals. During
   four stages of calibration, ranging from using only head data to also
   using an extensive set of measured stream flow gains, no parameter
   estimates changed significantly, but the number of parameters was
   increased from 12 to 14 in order to fit local stream flow gains. This
   indicates that the geology-based parameterization is firm.
   Adding stream flows to the calibration data reduced the uncertainty of
   the estimated parameters significantly. However, the uncertainty of some
   of the parameters was significant even when an extensive set of measured
   stream flow gains and hydraulic heads was used to calibrate the model.
   Parameter uncertainty is reflected in the uncertainty of the predicted
   stream now gains. When an extensive set of stream flow data was used
   during calibration, the prediction uncertainty is up to +/-25\% in large
   streams, and up to +/-60\% in smaller streams. The confidence intervals
   in general are skewed, and they are very skewed in the case where no
   stream now measurements were used to calibrate the model.
   The case study shows that even when relatively extensive geological
   information and calibration data are available, there may be significant
   uncertainty connected with the prediction of local discharge of ground
   water to streams. Reducing uncertainty in such cases will require
   extensive field investigations in order to improve the definition of
   recharge areas and to describe the local fluxes and now patterns in the
   aquifers.}},

Abstract = {{This study shows that hydrological systems in arid areas where water
   level data are incomplete can be better understood and constrained by
   using chemical and isotopic data. These constraints significantly alter
   the conceptual hydrological model of the Azraq area.
   Previous studies, based on water level data, suggest that water in the
   Azraq oasis is derived from two major piezometric highs; the western
   basalt aquifer to the northwest and the Tulul el Ashaquif highlands to
   the northeast of the oasis. Water from the Tulul el Ashaquif aquifer is
   also considered to drain to a piezometric low at Ruwaishid to the east,
   and then into deeper aquifers.
   Chemical data from this study show that the northwest basalt aquifer
   provides most of the water (80-85\%) to the Azraq oasis. Water from the
   Tulul el Ashaquif supplies a relatively small proportion, but due to its
   high solute content, imparts its chemical signature on the oasis water.
   This study has shown that water from Tulul el Ashaquif are not supplied
   to the Ruwaishid area, as previously thought.
   Stable isotopic data show that each piezometric high contains water
   which originated in a distinct climatic setting. Both water types are
   poor in tritium. Traces of tritium at the Azraq oasis and at Ruwaishid
   indicate some recent local recharge.}},

Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, ground water hydrologists and engineers must solve
   saturated/unsaturated flow and transport problems. The unsaturated
   component of flow is especially important when considering transport of
   contaminants that originate from surface or nearsurface sources such as
   waste spill sites, landfills, and hazardous waste storage sites.
   Numerical solution of such problems has been accomplished with special
   purpose computer programs developed for solution of unsaturated flow
   problems. However, general purpose partial differential equation (PDE)
   solvers also exist, which often provide greater model flexibility. In
   this paper, the performance of PDE2D, a general PDE solver, and
   SWMS\_2D, a special purpose program, are compared for solution of
   unsaturated flow and transport problems. Both programs accurately
   calculated changes In water volume in the flow domain for four examples,
   but PDE2D did not calculate boundary fluxes as well as SWMS\_2D,
   resulting in high mass balance errors. However, PDE2D yielded a smoother
   solution of the example solute transport problem, despite a large mass
   balance error. SWMS\_2D offers ease of use and excellent mass balances
   while PDE2D offers the user greater flexibility in terms of the types of
   problems solved, and a grid generator that ensures that the element size
   and distribution of elements are appropriate for a given problem.}},

Pages = {{7-8}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{A combined mathematical model and calculation method was developed for
   steady-state flow in a confined aquifer-well system for a general case
   of partial penetration. The model can be used for analysis of systems
   where the ends of well screens may not be located in the boundary plains
   of a confined aquifer.
   The hydraulics of the system are studied without the assumption that
   inflow to the screen is uniform. A partially penetrating well is
   represented as a linear sink located along the well axis between the
   boundary planes for description of the now in an aquifer. Description of
   the system includes equations of flow in the aquifer and in the radial
   and central orifices of the screen, taking into account energy losses
   and the momentum flux change along the well screen's axial (vertical)
   orifice.
   The use of the proposed combined model enables one (as in the specific
   case studied earlier where the upper end of the screen is located in the
   plane of the upper confining bed) to avoid substantial errors in
   calculations of the drawdown-well discharge function and maximum
   specific discharge to the screen which influences sand pumping,
   incrustation and corrosion processes.}},

   is an effective barrier to oxygen influx, contributes metals and
   nutrients to ground water, and promotes the acidification of ground
   water. Acidity, sulfate, and metals concentrations were elevated in the
   ground water (6- to 21-m depth) from spoil relative to unmined rock
   because of active oxidation of pyrite and dissolution of
   aluminosilicate, carbonate, and Mn-Fe-oxide minerals in the spoil.
   Concentrations of acidity, sulfate, metals (Fe, Mn, Al, Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni,
   Zn), and nitrate, and abundances of iron-oxidizing bacteria were
   elevated in the ground water from sludge-treated spoil relative to
   untreated spoil having a similar mineral composition; however, gaseous
   and dissolved oxygen concentrations did not differ between the
   treatments. Abundances of iron-oxidizing bacteria in the ground water
   samples were positively correlated with concentrations of ammonia,
   nitrate, acidity, metals, and sulfate. Concentrations of metals in
   vadose water samples (<5-m depth) from sludge-treated spoil (pH 5.9)
   were not elevated relative to untreated spoil (pH 4.4). In contrast,
   concentrations of nitrate were elevated in vadose water samples from
   sludge-treated spoil, frequently exceeding 10 mg/L. Downgradient
   decreases in nitrate to less than 3 mg/L and increases in sulfate
   concentrations in underlying ground water could result from oxidation of
   pyrite by nitrate. Thus, sewage sludge added to pyritic spoil can
   increase the growth of iron-oxidizing bacteria, the oxidation of pyrite,
   and the acidification of ground water. Nevertheless, the overall effects
   on ground water chemistry from the sludge were small and probably
   short-lived relative to the effects from mining only.}},

Abstract = {{Pingtung Plain is formed by Quaternary alluvial fan material from the
   three main rivers: Kaoping, Tungkang and Linpien. Ground water is the
   major water supply source on the plain. This is principally extracted
   from two aquifers, The natural ground water source is derived mainly
   from direct rainfall percolation and infiltration from the three rivers,
   with their catchments lying partly outside the plain. Rainfall
   characteristics are therefore the main factors controlling water
   resources availability, Pingtung Plain is an important primary
   production area for southern Taiwan, the comparatively warm climate
   allowing a long growing season, diversified cropping and the rearing of
   aquacultural produces, Approximately 75 percent of irrigation and
   domestic water supplies are derived from ground water, A mater balance
   for the entire plain indicates that ground water resources, under
   optimized management, are sufficient to meet the existing multi-purpose
   uses,
   Development of a hydrogeological conceptual model is the first phase of
   a numerical ground water flow simulation, Preliminary results are
   encouraging, with the final simulations affording better insight to the
   hydraulic behavior of the aquifer system, Data input requirements for
   model operation fall into three categories: hydrological stresses,
   hydrogeological parameters and boundary conditions,
   After the model is built, the normal numerical modeling process requires
   significant calibration and sensitivity analyses for the hydrogeological
   parameters and stresses which are the most sensitive, but the least well
   defined,
   A well-calibrated simulation model can lead to a reliable and realistic
   management model, With this in mind, the calibration processes detailed
   are presented, and these data are introduced as initial values in the
   calibration process.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Slug tests in fractured rock usually are interpreted with models that
   assume homogeneous formation properties, even though hydraulic
   properties of fractures can vary by many orders of magnitude over the
   length of boreholes, To investigate the impact of heterogeneity on the
   interpretation of slug tests in fractured rock, slug tests were
   conducted over large intervals of boreholes in crystalline rock in
   central New Hampshire, and interpreted using a homogeneous model, The
   results of the slug tests were then compared with estimates of
   transmissivity from fluid-injection tests conducted over shorter
   intervals in the same boreholes, The fluid-injection tests showed
   transmissivity to vary more than six orders of magnitude over the length
   of the boreholes; however, the sum of the transmissivities from the
   fluid-injection tests were within an order of magnitude of the
   transmissivity estimated from the slug tests, Although the two estimates
   of transmissivity were within an order of magnitude of each other, the
   water level responses during the slug tests did not exactly match the
   responses predicted by the homogeneous model, To investigate the effect
   of heterogeneity on water level responses during slug tests, a
   Laplace-transform solution was developed for slug tests conducted in
   boreholes containing multiple fractures with hydraulic properties that
   vary over the length of the borehole, A comparison of this solution with
   the homogeneous model shows no difference between the shape of water
   level responses in a homogeneous formation and a (layered) heterogeneous
   formation, Furthermore, the transmissivity estimated using a homogeneous
   model is within an order of magnitude of the prescribed transmissivity
   in the heterogeneous model, Thus, differences between responses
   predicted from a homogeneous model and measured water levels during slug
   tests can be attributed to phenomena such as nonradial now in the
   vicinity of the borehole, and not heterogeneous hydraulic properties
   over the length of the borehole, The experimental results of this
   investigation show that even when conditions such as nonradial flow are
   present in the vicinity of the borehole, interpretations of slug tests
   using a homogeneous model provided order-of-magnitude estimates of
   transmissivity in the crystalline rock terrane under consideration.}},

Title = {{How uncertain is our estimate of a wellhead protection zone?}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Protection zones for wells are defined through the use of pathline
   tracing in ground water flow models. Traditional approaches to ground
   water now modeling focus on obtaining a single best model, occasionally
   supplemented by the use of sensitivity analyses, In most situations this
   approach is inappropriate because the ground water flow model is so
   poorly determined that a variety of different boundary conditions and
   parameter values would give similar predictions of heads, However, the
   range of feasible models may well give radically different predictions
   of the variable for which the model has been built. For example, the
   area, orientation, or many other descriptive variables of a catchment
   may be much more sensitive to the parameters used in a ground water now
   model than are the values of head commonly used to calibrate the model,
   This paper outlines a procedure to determine the range of predictions of
   catchments which would arise from alternative calibrations of a model,
   The range of catchments is used to identify zones of certainty and
   uncertainty, leading to alternative definitions of the protection zone
   for differing purposes, An example is presented, based on Bestwood
   Pumping Station, Nottinghamshire, which is located in the Triassic
   Sandstone Aquifer of the northern East Midlands of the United Kingdom, A
   trial and error calibration of a ground water flow model is used to
   determine an acceptable level for automatic calibration in the
   subsequent step. Only 12 measurements of ground water head were
   available, and these were used to determine the fit of a variety of
   model structures. A search routine revealed a range of feasible models
   and superposition of their catchments delineated the zones of certainty
   and uncertainty, which had areas of 7.4 and 15.2 km(2), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the factors that influence the distribution of methane in
   Texas ground water, water samples were collected from 40 wells in
   east-central and central Texas aquifers, Among the chemical parameters
   examined, sulfate is most important in controlling methane distribution,
   Methane occurs in high concentration (>10 mu M) in east-central Texas
   only where sulfate concentration is low (<1 mu M), supporting the
   hypothesis that abundant microbial methane production does not begin
   until sulfate is depleted. Because water samples from central Texas are
   high in either oxygen (up to 172 mu M) or sulfate (up to 28.7 mu M),
   methane concentrations are low (<5 mu M) in these waters, A positive
   correlation between methane and sulfate in these waters indicates a
   different, perhaps thermogenic, origin for the trace methane,
   The C-13/C-12 ratios of dissolved methane ranged from -80 parts per
   thousand to -21 parts per thousand in east-central Texas and from -41.2
   parts per thousand to -8.5 parts per thousand in central Texas, Low
   values of < -50 parts per thousand in the east-central Texas ground
   water indicate a microbial origin for methane and are consistent with
   the observed sulfate-methane relationship; high C-13/C-12 ratios of >
   -31 parts per thousand likely result from bacterial methane oxidation,
   Similarly, methane with high C-13/C-12 ratios in central Texas may
   reflect partial oxidation of the methane pool, Overall, water samples
   from both regions show a positive correlation between sulfate
   concentration and the C-13/C-12 ratio of methane, suggesting that
   methane oxidation may be associated with sulfate reduction in Texas
   ground water.}},

Abstract = {{In heterogeneous granular aquifers, an important issue affecting the
   analysis of pump test data is whether or not positive skin effects
   exist. Positive skin effects include head losses and changes in radial
   flow patterns caused by a local reduction of aquifer permeability near a
   well, In order to investigate the impact and formation of positive
   skins, field tests were performed at seven pairs of closely-spaced wells
   located in the vicinity of a paleochannel at Columbus Air Force Base
   (CAFE), Mississippi, In the paleochannel a 1-2 m thick zone of high-g
   channel lag deposits lies beneath a 2-3 m thick zone of fine-grained
   channel fill deposits, Each well pair consisted of a well,vith and
   without a gravel pack, At the well pairs outside of the paleochannel
   boundaries, borehole flowmeter tests produce similar field results, At
   the well pairs inside of the paleochannel boundaries, however, borehole
   flowmeter tests produced very different results, Examination of the test
   results indicate that positive skins exist at wells without gravel packs
   that intersect the paleochannel, During well installations, positive
   skins appear to be produced by the downward mixing of the fine-grained
   deposits into the channel lag deposits, Notable positive skin effects
   include increased specific capacities, increased total drawdowns, and
   changes in the distribution of horizontal now to a pumped well, Among
   the key implications regarding borehole flowmeter tests in heterogeneous
   aquifers similar to that at CAFE are: (1) wells should be installed with
   gravel packs; and (2) transmissivity values should be calculated using
   the Cooper-Jacob straight-line method rather than the Cooper-Jacob
   equation.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural irrigation has a substantial impact on water quantity and
   quality in the lower Arkansas River valley of southeastern Colorado, A
   two-dimensional now and solute transport model was used to evaluate the
   potential effects of changes in irrigation on the quantity and quality
   of water in the alluvial aquifer and in the Arkansas River along an 17.7
   km reach of the river, The model was calibrated to aquifer water level
   and dissolved solids concentration data collected throughout the 24 year
   study period (1971-95). Two categories of irrigation management were
   simulated with the calibrated model: (1) a decrease in ground water
   withdrawals for irrigation; and (2) cessation of all irrigation from
   ground water and surface water sources, In the modeled category of
   decreased irrigation from ground water pumping, there was a resulting
   6.9\% decrease in the average monthly ground water salinity, a 0.6\%
   decrease in average monthly river salinity, and an 11.1\% increase in
   ground water return flows to the river, In the modeled category of the
   cessation of all irrigation, average monthly ground water salinity
   decreased by 25\%; average monthly river salinity decreased by 4.4\%;
   and ground water return nons to the river decreased by an average of
   64\%. In all scenarios, simulated ground water salinity decreased
   relative to historical conditions for about 12 years before reaching a
   new dynamic equilibrium condition, Aquifer water levels were not
   sensitive to any. of the modeled scenarios, These potential changes in
   salinity could result in improved mater quality for irrigation purposes

Abstract = {{Independent estimates of absolute hydraulic conductivity were obtained
   by a ``standard{''} aquifer pumping test and a forced-gradient tracer
   test in a highly heterogeneous aquifer, An aquifer hydraulic test was
   conducted to evaluate the average hydraulic conductivity (K), and to
   establish steady-state flow for the tracer test, An average K of 48
   m/day was interpreted from the drawdown data in a fully screened well,
   Type-curve matching and simulation with MODFLOW of the hydraulic
   response in partially screened wells indicates K of 10 to 15 m/day for
   the upper section and 71 to 73 m/day for the deeper section, Iodide and
   fluorescent dye tracers were injected at low rates in wells located
   approximately 8 m upgradient of the production well, Tracer breakthrough
   was monitored in the production well and at ten depth intervals within
   the fully screened monitoring well, Interpretation of tracer response in
   the production well reveals tracer transport is limited to a 3.9 m thick
   section of the 20 m thick aquifer, with a hydraulic conductivity of 248
   m/day, However, the depth distribution of these permeable strata cannot
   be determined from the production well tracer response, When sampled at
   1.5 m depth intervals in the monitoring well, breakthrough was observed
   in only three intervals along the entire 18.2 m screened well, K
   estimates from tracer travel time within discrete high-permeability
   strata range from 31 to 317 m/day, Inclusion of permeameter K estimates
   for the lower permeability aquifer sands (4-10 m/day) result in a range
   in relative K of 0.01 to 1.0. This field site has the highest absolute K
   estimate for a discrete stratum and the widest range in relative
   hydraulic conductivity amongst research field sites with K estimates for
   discrete strata, Within such a highly stratified aquifer, the use of an
   average K from an aquifer pumping test to predict solute transport
   results in great underestimation of transport distances for a given time
   period.}},

Abstract = {{A productivity parameter was developed to compare vertical and
   horizontal ground water remediation scenarios. The parameter was
   determined by dividing the cumulative mass of contaminant removed from
   an aquifer in a specified time by the total volume of ground water
   extracted to remove the mass, This was compared to two other methods of
   assessing remediation effectiveness: (1) the mass of contaminant removed
   at specified times; and (2) the volume of aquifer containing
   contaminants above a specified concentration limit as a function of
   time,
   A finite-difference now and a contaminant mass transport model were used
   to simulate a hypothetical contaminated aquifer. Productivity indices
   were calculated for the remediation scenarios developed in this paper It
   is shown that these indices can be used as an additional tool in
   choosing among possible remediation scenarios.
   It was demonstrated that a ranking can be obtained for the various
   remediation scenarios, using each of our three methods for assessing
   remediation effectiveness. The ranking of a scenario depended on which
   method was used, and the selection of one particular remediation
   scenario over the other can be made taking the three methods into
   account. The relative importance of the three methods depended on the
   goal of the remediation. In an actual design, these methods can be used
   as part of the overall feasibility study that includes cost
   considerations.}},

Title = {{Rhodamine WT and Bacillus subtilis transport through an alluvial gravel
   aquifer}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{112-122}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to characterize the transport of rhodamine
   WT dye and endospores of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis through
   preferential flowpaths in an alluvial gravel aquifer using natural
   gradient tracer experiments. Preliminary tracer experiments were
   conducted with rhodamine WT to determine preferential flowpaths using a
   resin bag method, because of spatial heterogeneity at the study site.
   Rhodamine WT, Ci, and B. subtilis endospores were then injected 0.1 to
   1.6 m below the water table, and downgradient ground water was
   monitored. Rhodamine WT behaved like Cl in the field and was used as a
   nonreactive tracer in this study. The method of time moments (MTM) and a
   curve fitting method (CFM) using the AT123D model were applied to
   estimate transport parameters of rhodamine WT and B. subtilis endospores
   along preferential flowpaths within the aquifer, assuming each
   individual flowpath to be uniform. The results from CFM fit the observed
   data better than did MTM. Ground water velocities through preferential
   flowpaths ranged from 30 to 85 m/day with a median of 63 m/day, and
   longitudinal dispersivities ranged from 0.71 to 5.24 m with a median of
   2.70 m. These values are within the range reported in the literature for
   similar hydrogeological conditions.
   B. subtilis endospores exhibited slightly faster velocities (median
   retardation factor 0.86) and lower longitudinal dispersivities (0.23 to
   2.4 m, median 0.79 m) compared to rhodamine WT. When multiple
   concentration peaks were observed in the rhodamine WT breakthrough
   curves (BTCs), the bacteria always arrived with the first rhodamine WT
   peak, regardless of whether the first peak was small or large. For those
   wells with a single peak for both the dye and the bacteria, the bacteria
   tended to coincide with the front portion of the dye BTC. This suggests
   that convection is relatively more important for B. subtilis endospores
   than for the dye, probably due to pore size exclusion of the spores. For
   this reason, the use of non-reactive solute tracers to reflect the
   movement of microorganisms may not be appropriate. The total removal
   rates of B. subtilis varied from 2.4 to 9.36 day(-1) (median 3.36
   day(-1)), probably resulting from filtration, sedimentation, and
   irreversible adsorption, as die-off was not observed in the field during
   the 45 days of the study. The longevity of B. subtilis endospores in
   ground water makes it a good choice to use as a bacterial tracer in the
   study of transport processes in the absence of die-off.}},

   systems, The model was tested with field data collected from a typical
   septic system located near Cambridge, Ontario, Canada, Model simulations
   were in good agreement with field data for the laundry detergent
   builders tartrate monosuccinate (TMS) and tartrate dissuccinate (TDS),
   The model was also independently verified with phosphate data collected
   from the study site, A sensitivity analysis showed little change in
   model predictions when the distribution coefficient and biodegradation
   rate constants were varied by 10\%. Results from this study support that
   this model is satisfactory as a screening level tool for predicting the
   fate and transport of household chemicals in septic systems.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative information on dissolved gas transport in ground water
   aquifers is needed for a variety of site characterization and remedial
   design applications. The objective of this study was to gain further
   understanding of dissolved gas transport in the presence of trapped gas
   in the pore space of an otherwise water saturated porous medium, using a
   combination of laboratory experiments and numerical modeling. Transport
   experiments were conducted in a large-scale (4 x 2 x 0.2 m) laboratory
   physical aquifer model containing a homogeneous sandpack. Tracer (Br-)
   and dissolved gas (O-2 or H-2) plumes were created using a two-well
   injection/extraction scheme and then were allowed to drift in a uniform
   flow field. Plume locations and shapes were monitored by measuring
   tracer and dissolved gas concentrations as a function of position within
   the sandpack and time. In all experiments, partitioning of the dissolved
   gases between the mobile ground water and stationary trapped gas phases
   resulted in substantial retardation and tailing of the dissolved O-2 and
   H-2 plumes relative to the Br- plumes. Most observed plume features
   could be reproduced in simulations performed with a numerical model that
   combined the advection-dispersion equation with diffusion controlled
   mass transfer of dissolved gas between the mobile aqueous and stationary
   trapped gas phases. Fitted values of the volumetric trapped gas content
   and mass transfer coefficient ranged from 0.04 to 0.08 and from 10(-6)
   to 10(-5) sec(-1), respectively. Sensitivity analyses were used to
   examine how systematic variations in these parameters would be expected
   to affect dissolved gas transport under a range of potential field
   conditions. The experimental and modeling results indicate that
   diffusion controlled mass transfer should be considered when predicting
   dissolved gas transport in ground water aquifers in the presence of
   trapped gas.}},

Abstract = {{Prior information on parameters such as hydraulic conductivity or ground
   water recharge rates is often used to stabilize the inverse problem in
   parameter estimation, A cautious use of prior information is advisable,
   however, because it may be biased or unrepresentative of the model
   parameters and/or it may not significantly stabilize the parameter
   estimates, Procedures are given: (1) to identify the model parameters
   for which prior information may best stabilize the parameter set; and
   (2) to identify the model parameters for which errors in the prior
   information lead to the smallest possible errors in the final set of
   parameter estimates, The first case is referred to as the efficient use
   of prior information; the second case is referred to as the responsible
   use of prior information, The procedures are based on an analysis of the
   model parameter space using response surfaces, multiparameter confidence
   regions, and eigenspace analysis, The guidelines lead to the selection
   of prior information on those parameters whose axes are most closely
   aligned with the longest axis of the parameter confidence region. Simple
   synthetic examples are used to explain the concepts, The advantages
   gained in screening the model parameters to identify those parameters
   for which prior information will be most efficient and responsible in
   determining the final values of the parameter estimates are demonstrated
   in the calibration of a ground water flow and solute transport model for
   the San Juan Basin, New Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{The use of granular iron for in situ degradation of dissolved
   chlorinated organic compounds is rapidly gaining acceptance as a
   cost-effective technology for ground water remediation, This paper
   describes the first field demonstration of the technology, and is of
   particular importance since it provides the longest available record of
   performance (five years), A mixture of 22\% granular iron and 78\% sand
   was installed as a permeable ``wall{''} across the path of a contaminant
   plume at Canadian Forces Base, Borden, Ontario, The major contaminants
   were trichloroethene (TCE, 268 mg/L) and tetrachloroethene (PCE, 58
   mg/L). Approximately 90\% of the TCE and 86\% of the PCE were removed by
   reductive dechlorination within the wall, with no measurable decrease in
   performance over the five year duration of the test. Though about 1\% of
   the influent TCE and PCE appeared as dichloroethene isomers as a
   consequence of the dechlorination of TCE and PCE, these also degraded
   within the iron-sand mixture, Performance of the field installation was
   reasonably consistent with the results of laboratory column studies
   conducted to simulate the field behavior, However, if a more reactive
   iron material, or a higher percentage of iron had been used, complete
   removal of the chlorinated compounds might have been achieved. Changes
   in water chemistry-indicated that calcium carbonate was precipitating
   within the reactive material; however, the trace amount of precipitate
   detected in core samples collected four gears after installation of the
   wall suggest that the observed performance should persist for at least
   another five years. The study provides strong evidence that in situ use
   of granular iron could provide a long-term, low-maintenance cost
   solution far many ground water contamination problems.}},

Abstract = {{The impact on ground water quality from increasing fertilizer
   application rates over the past 40 years is evaluated within a glacial
   aquifer system beneath a thick unsaturated zone. Ground water ages
   within the aquifer could not be accurately determined from the measured
   distribution of H-3 and as a result, chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) and
   H-3/He-3 dating techniques were applied. Beneath a 25 m thick
   unsaturated zone, ground water ages based on CFC-11 concentrations were
   greater than H-3/He-3 ground water ages by 6 to 10 years, due to the
   time lag associated with the diffusion of CFCs through the unsaturated
   zone, Using the corrected CFC-11 and H-3/He-3 ground water ages and the
   estimated travel time of 3H within the unsaturated zone, the approximate
   position of ground water recharged since the mid-1960s was determined,
   Nitrate concentrations within post mid-1960s recharge were generally
   elevated and near or above the drinking water limit of 10 mg-N/L. In
   comparison, pre mid-1960s recharge had nitrate concentrations <2.5
   mg-N/L. The elevated NO3- concentrations in post mid-1960s recharge are
   attributed mainly to increasing fertilizer application rates between
   1970 and the mid-to late 1980s. Anaerobic conditions suitable for
   denitrification are present within pre mid-1960s recharge indicating
   that removal of DO is a slow process taking tens of years, Over the next
   10 to 20 years, nitrate concentrations at municipal well fields that are
   currently capturing aerobic ground water recharged near the mid-1960s
   are expected to increase because of the higher fertilizer application
   rates beginning in the 1970s and 1980s.}},

Title = {{Wellbore skin effect in slug-test data analysis for low-permeability
   geologic materials}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{931-937}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The wellbore skin effect on slug-test results was analyzed using
   numerical simulation and field tests for a well at progressive stages of
   development. The numerical simulation is based on a composite now model
   that incorporates a zone of disturbed formation surrounding the
   wellbore. Field tests were performed on a water-bearing clayey silt
   formation at a ground-water remediation site in Wisconsin. Based on the
   numerical simulation, the radius of investigation was examined. The
   results show that the early-time and late-time data reflect ground-water
   now in the wellbore skin and undisturbed formation, respectively.
   Both the numerically simulated and the field slug-test data define a
   downward concave curve on a semilog plot of time versus the logarithm of
   dimensionless head. For the Hvorslev (1951) and Bouwer and Rice (1976)
   methods, the late-time segment of the simulated data yields estimates of
   hydraulic conductivity close to the value defined in the now model. When
   a wellbore skin exists, the data curve in a plot of the logarithm of
   time versus the dimensionless head is shifted horizontally along the
   time axis. This shift leads to an inaccurate determination of hydraulic
   conductivity based on the Cooper et al. (1967) method. In the plots of
   time versus dimensionless head derivatives, the data curve geometry
   depends on the hydraulic properties of the wellbore skin. Consequently,
   the wellbore skin effect can be identified and eliminated using
   derivative-based type curve methods.
   For low-permeability materials, the effect of wellbore skin on estimates
   of hydraulic conductivity can be minimized through use of the late-time
   data. However, proper well installation and development appears to be
   the most effective and practical solution.}},

Abstract = {{A multiphase flow model (ARMOS) was used to evaluate the effects of
   subsurface heterogeneities on the recovery of light, nonaqueous phase
   liquids (LNAPLs or simply `'oil''). Stochastic inputs for the model
   included the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sw), van Genuchten
   alpha and n, the water saturation at field capacity (S-m), and the
   maximum residual oil saturations in the saturated (S-or) and the
   unsaturated zones (S-og). The turning bands method was used to generate
   stochastic soil parameters representing three hypothetical sandy loam
   soils. Oil recovery in the three heterogeneous cases was compared to an
   `'equivalent'' homogeneous soil with effective parameters computed as
   the geometric means of the stochastic parameters. Distributions of the
   free oil plumes were described over time using statistical and spatial
   moment analyses. Due to the smoothing effect of the flow process, the
   predicted well oil thickness (H-o) and free oil specific volume (V-of)
   were less variable than the input stochastic parameter In(K-sw).
   However, H-o and V-of became more variable as free oil volume diminished
   and the oil distribution was controlled more by soil variability than
   gradients in the fluid levels. At the onset of oil recovery, the free
   oil area was greater in all three heterogeneous soils than the
   homogeneous soil. Nevertheless, soil heterogeneities did not greatly
   affect oil recovery or trapping in the saturated and unsaturated zones.
   Heterogeneities may have had a greater influence on oil recovery if a
   smaller spill had been studied or if the vertical dimension had been
   simulated explicitly. The results suggest that the geometric mean soil
   properties provide a useful estimate of the potential for oil recovery
   from oil spills that span a large number of correlation scales.}},

Abstract = {{A field demonstration of surfactant-enhanced solubilization was
   completed in a shallow unconfined aquifer located at a Coast Guard
   Station in Traverse City, Michigan. The primary objectives of the study
   were: (1) to assess the ability of the vertical circulation well (VCW)
   system for controlling chemical extractants added to the subsurface; and
   (2) to assess the behavior of the surfactant solution in the subsurface,
   with a goal of maximum surfactant recovery, A secondary objective was to
   demonstrate enhanced removal of PCE and recalcitrant components of a jet
   fuel, The analytical results showed that the surfactant increased the
   contaminant mass extracted by 40-fold and 90-fold for the PCE and jet
   fuel constituents, respectively. The surfactant solution demonstrated
   minimal sorption (retardation) and did not precipitate in the subsurface
   formation, In addition, the VCW system was able to capture in excess of
   95\% of the injected surfactant solution. Additional field testing and
   full-scale implementation of surfactant-enhanced subsurface remediation
   should be performed.}},

   then used to optimize the performance of the VCW system during the
   subsequent field-scale demonstration study which utilized the VCW for
   injecting and extracting a surfactant solution, Information from the

Abstract = {{Zones of dense, nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) are difficult to
   characterize as to their volume, composition, and spatial distribution
   using conventional ground-water extraction and soil-sampling methods.
   Such incompletely characterized sites have negative consequences for
   those responsible for their remedial design, e.g., the uncertainties in
   the optimal placement of ground-water extraction wells and in the
   duration of remediation. However, the recent use of the partitioning
   interwell tracer test (PITT) to characterize DNAPL zones at sites in New
   Mexico {[}unsaturated alluvium] and in Ohio, Texas, and Utah
   {[}saturated alluvium] demonstrates that the volume and spatial
   distribution of residual DNAPL can be determined with accuracy. The PITT
   involves injection of a suite of tracers which reversibly partition to
   different degrees between the DNAPL and the ground water or soil air
   resulting in the chromatographic separation of the tracer signals
   observed at the extraction well(s). The design of a PITT requires
   careful consideration of the hydrostratigraphic, hydraulic, and certain
   geochemical properties of the alluvium being tested. A
   three-dimensional, numerical model of a heterogeneous alluvial aquifer
   containing DNAPL has been developed for use with the UTCHEM simulator to
   demonstrate partitioning tracer testing and to address questions that
   are frequently raised in its application. The simulations include (1)
   the estimation of DNAPL volume for the simple case where only residual
   DNAPL is present in heterogeneous alluvium, (2) sensitivity studies to
   demonstrate the effect of increasingly low residual DNAPL saturation on
   the tracer signal, and (3) the effect of free-phase DNAPL on the
   estimation of the volume of DNAPL present. Furthermore, the potential
   interference of sedimentary organic carbon as a DNAPL surrogate on the
   tracer signal is considered and shown to be readily resolved by the
   careful choice of tracers. Finally, a protocol for the use of PITTs in
   alluvial aquifers is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The taxonomy and physiology of microorganisms isolated from contaminated
   ground-water recovery wells prone to biofouling are characterized for an
   industrial site in Rochester, New York. Principal aquifer contaminants
   include acetone, cyclohexane, dichloroethane, dichloromethane,
   1,4-dioxane, isopropanol, methanol, and toluene. These contaminants
   represent a significant fraction (up to 95\%) of the total organic
   carbon in the ground water. Ground-water samples from 12 recovery wells
   were used to isolate, quantity, and identity aerobic and anaerobic
   bacterial populations. Samples from selected wells were also
   characterized geochemically to assess redox conditions and availability
   of essential and trace nutrients. Dominant bacteria, listed in order of
   descending numbers, including sulfate-reducers (Desulfovibrio
   desulfuricans), anaerobic heterotrophs (Actinomyces, Bacteriodes,
   Bacillus, Agrobacterium), aerobic heterotrophs (Pseudomonas,
   Flavobacterium, Nocardia, Citrobacter), iron-oxidizers (Gallionella
   ferruginea, Crenothrix polyspora), iron-reducers (Shewanella), and
   sulfur-oxidizers (Thiobacillus ferrooxidans). Fungi were also recovered
   in low numbers. Both aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs were able to
   utilize all principal contaminants as sole carbon and energy sources
   except 1,4-dioxane. The prevalence of heterotrophic bacteria and their
   ability to use the available anthropogenic carbon suggests that aerobic
   and anaerobic heterotrophs contribute to the biofouling of wells at this
   site, in addition to the often cited fouling due to iron-oxidizing
   bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ground-water interaction with lakes is often difficult to document
   because of both its diffusiveness and its spatial and temporal
   variability; reproducible measurements can be difficult to obtain. This
   paper takes advantage of the construction of a major drain stress in an
   aquifer system proximal to Lake Michigan to examine gound-water/lake
   interactions in a complex hydrogeological setting.
   At the time of the measurements, the tunnel (4 to 8 m in diameter, 13 km
   in length, 1 to 3 km inland, and constructed in a low conductivity unit
   within a layered, fractured dolomite aquifer) had produced drawdowns of
   up to 50 m in the aquifer. In turn, the resulting trough of depression
   was inducing over 1600 m(3)/day (425,000 gpd) of water to flow from the
   lake to the tunnel. Seepage meters have been deployed over 40 km(2) of
   the lake bed to define the extent of the tunnel's impact.
   The results show that seepage through the lake bed is a combination of
   downward flow toward the tunnel and lateral inflow generated by recharge
   events in shallow unconsolidated sediments. Downward seepage is
   detectable to more than 2 km offshore, so an average of over 20 m of
   clay-rich glacial deposits and 10 m of dolomitic shale (both with
   hydraulic conductivities < 3 x 10(-8) m/sec) does not isolate the lake
   from the aquifer. Seepage meters have proven to be a viable and
   cost-effective means to provide an accurate spatial distribution of
   ground-water/lake exchanges over a large area.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of hydraulic head response to lagoon leakage into an
   extremely heterogeneous aquifer allow qualitative identification of
   spatial patterns in heterogeneity. In a 150-hour leakage experiment over
   such an aquifer, the fluid mass balance was estimated using a
   stage-fluctuation model while transient response was observed in
   downgradient wells and springs. Based on timing with respect to pond
   leakage, water-level response at different locations within the aquifer
   may be identified as either within or outside the influence of
   preferred-flow paths (PFPs). Flows at springs 150-200 m from the pond
   increased by 20-60\% above baseline flows, showing initial increase
   within ca. 40 hours, Synoptic water-level rise patterns observed during
   the test describe enlargement of a recharge mound from beneath the pond
   and suggest the spatial pattern of PFPs to > 150 m distant. An
   analytical model assuming homogeneity (Hantush, 1967), applied to
   water-level response for wells > 30 m from the pond, overestimated K by
   > 1 order of magnitude in comparison to slug-test estimates. This
   discrepancy is attributed to the inferred presence of linearly
   continuous heterogeneities causing preferential flow. Large-scale
   hydraulic tests such as this sample the spatial structure for conductive
   pathways and may be of utility in parameterization of numerical flow
   models. In contrast, slug-test results give local parameter estimates,
   but more limited information on PFP distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A 2D equivalent porous media (EPM) model was used to simulate transport
   of tritium for a field-scale tracer experiment in a fractured and highly
   weathered shale saprolite. The tritium plume was characterized by rapid
   migration of the leading edge of the plume (up to 0.4 m/day), slower
   movement of the center of mass of the tritium pulse (0.009 m/day) and
   very slow decline of concentrations in the `'tail'' of the breakthrough
   curve (which has persisted at the site for at least 16 years), The EPM
   model successfully described the shape of the plume and the breakthrough
   curves for a monitoring well 3.7 m downgradient of the injection well
   using a now velocity of 0.01 m/day and longitudinal and transverse
   dispersivity values of 0.8 m. An unusually low ratio of longitudinal and
   transverse dispersivity (alpha(L)/alpha(T) = 1) was needed to fit the
   nearly circular shape of the plume, which is believed to be caused by
   the water-table slope being perpendicular to the orientation of the
   prominent bedding plane fractures (which are expected to correspond to
   K-max). Simulated values for concentrations in the long `'tail'' of the
   breakthrough curve observed in a downgradient well were especially
   sensitive to the value of longitudinal dispersivity used. The best-fit
   simulation, based on data over a 5 year period, was extrapolated to the
   most recent data point (16 years after the start of the injection) and
   the simulated concentration was very close to the measured value. Model
   predictions made with a slightly different value of longitudinal
   dispersivity resulted in very large errors at late time, indicating that
   duration of monitoring data (which strongly influences the fitting of
   longitudinal dispersivity) is a critical factor in accurate prediction.
   The experiment and simulations show that contaminant plumes can persist
   for long periods of time in fractured porous materials, presumably due
   to diffusive exchange between the rapidly moving water in the fractures
   and the relatively immobile pore water in the fine-grained matrix.}},

Abstract = {{A new method to simulate solute transport in 1-D heterogeneous media is
   presented. This time domain random walk method (TDRW), similar in
   concept to the classical random walk method, calculates the arrival time
   of a particle cloud at a given location (directly providing the solute
   breakthrough curve). The main advantage of the method is that the
   restrictions on the space increments and the time steps which exist with
   the finite differences and random walk methods are avoided. In a
   homogeneous zone, the breakthrough curve (ETC) can be calculated
   directly at a given distance using a few hundred particles or directly
   at the boundary of the zone. comparisons with analytical solutions and
   with the classical random walk method show the reliability of this
   method. The velocity and dispersivity calculated from the simulated
   results agree within two percent with the values used as input in the
   model. For contrasted heterogeneous media, the random walk can generate
   high numerical dispersion, while the time domain approach does not.}},

Abstract = {{In the mantled karst terrane of northern Florida, the water quality of
   the Upper Floridan aquifer is influenced by the degree of connectivity
   between the aquifer and the surface. Chemical and isotopic analyses
   {[}O-18/O-16(delta(18)O),H-2/H-1(delta D),C-13/C-12(delta(13)C),
   tritium(H-3), and strontium-87/strontium-86(Sr-87/Sr-86)]along with
   geochemical mass-balance modeling were used to identify the dominant
   hydrochemical processes that control the composition of ground water as
   it evolves downgradient in two systems. In one system, surface water
   enters the Upper Floridan aquifer through a sinkhole located in the
   Northern Highlands physiographic unit. In the other system, surface
   water enters the aquifer through a sinkhole lake (Lake Bradford) in the
   Woodville Karst Plain. Differences in the composition of water isotopes
   (delta(18)O and delta D) in rainfall, ground water, and surface water
   were used to develop mixing models of surface water (leakage of water to
   the Upper Floridan aquifer from a sinkhole lake and a sinkhole) and
   ground water. Using mass-balance calculations, based on differences in
   delta(18)O and delta D, the proportion of lake water that mixed with
   meteoric water ranged from 7 to 86\% in water from wells located in
   close proximity to Lake Bradford, In deeper parts of the Upper Floridan
   aquifer, water enriched in O-18 and D from five of 12 sampled municipal
   wells indicated that recharge from a sinkhole (1 to 24\%) and surface
   water with an evaporated isotopic signature (2 to 32\%) was mixing with
   ground water.
   The solute isotopes, delta(13)C and Sr-87/Sr-86, were used to test the
   sensitivity of binary and ternary mixing models, and to estimate the
   amount of mass transfer of carbon and other dissolved species in
   geochemical reactions. In ground water downgradient from Lake Bradford,
   the dominant processes controlling carbon cycling in ground water were
   dissolution of carbonate minerals, aerobic degradation of organic
   matter, and hydrolysis of silicate minerals. In the deeper parts of the
   Upper Floridan aquifer, the major processes controlling the
   concentrations of major dissolved species included dissolution of
   calcite and dolomite, and degradation of organic matter under oxic
   conditions. The Upper Floridan aquifer is highly susceptible to
   contamination from activities at the land surface in the Tallahassee
   area. The presence of post-1950s concentrations of H-3 in ground water
   from depths greater than 100 m below land surface indicates that water
   throughout much of the Upper Floridan aquifer has been recharged during
   the last 40 years. Even though mixing is likely between ground water and
   surface water in many parts of the study area, the Upper Floridan
   aquifer produces good quality water, which due to dilution effects shows
   little if any impact from trace elements or nutrients that are present
   in surface waters.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence and distribution of elevated nitrate concentrations
   (greater than or equal to 3 mg/1) in ground water in the Puget Sound
   Basin, Washington, were determined by examining existing data from more
   than 3000 wells. Models that estimate the probability that a well has an
   elevated nitrate concentration were constructed by relating the
   occurrence of elevated nitrate concentrations to both natural and
   anthropogenic variables using logistic regression. The variables that
   best explain the occurrence of elevated nitrate concentrations were well
   depth, surficial geology, and the percentage of urban and agricultural
   land within a radius of 3.2 kilometers of the well. From these
   relations, logistic regression models were developed to assess aquifer
   susceptibility (relative ease with which contaminants will reach
   aquifer) and ground-water vulnerability (relative ease with which
   contaminants will reach aquifer for a given set of land-use practices).
   Both models performed well at predicting the probability of elevated
   nitrate concentrations in an independent data set. This approach to
   assessing aquifer susceptibility and ground-water vulnerability has the
   advantages of having both model variables and coefficient values
   determined on the basis of existing water quality information and does
   not depend on the assignment of variables and weighting factors based on
   qualitative criteria.}},

Title = {{Capture zone geometry in a fractured carbonate aquifer}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1040-1049}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study examined a fractured carbonate aquifer that has a transition
   from porous media type (continuum) flow near the bedrock surface to
   discrete fracture (noncontinuum) flow at depth, Three depth zones were
   delineated using a borehole flowmeter, borehole video logs, and pumping
   tests. The upper zone is fractured to the degree where it behaves
   hydraulically as a continuum, the middle zone is less fractured and
   behaves as a discretely fractured aquifer, and the lower zone is least
   fractured, has no measurable fracture interconnection, and behaves as an
   aquitard. These zones were not related to lithologic boundaries, showing
   that monitoring well design based solely on lithology may be
   inappropriate in some fractured systems.
   The geometries of capture zones in this aquifer were determined by
   combining the field observations with numerical modeling, The capture
   zone geometries are very complex, containing thin areally extensive
   features around fractures in the middle zone which extend over an area
   17.5 times greater than the capture area in the upper continuum zone, A
   capture zone computed with lumped aquifer parameters leads to inaccurate
   conceptualization of capture zone geometry at this site.
   The presence of open corehole monitoring wells affected the flow regime
   under both ambient and pumping conditions. The wells act as short
   circuits between otherwise isolated fractues and fracture zones. By
   connecting the continuum to the noncontinuum now regime with the wells,
   ambient flow in the noncontinuum regime was increased by a factor of 20,
   Under pumping conditions, the presence of the monitoring wells alters
   the capture zone of the pumping well, Discrete fractures provide a
   connection between the pumping and observation wells at depth that
   causes separate cones of depression to be formed around observation
   wells in the upper aquifer, and thus, the capture zone in the
   near-surface aquifer may include multiple, isolated areas around
   monitoring wells.}},

Abstract = {{EPA requires statistical procedures to determine whether soil or ground
   water adjacent to or below waste units is contaminated. These
   statistical procedures are often based on comparisons between two sets
   of data: one representing background conditions, and one representing
   site conditions, Since statistical requirements were originally
   promulgated in the 1980s, EPA has made several improvements and
   modifications. There are, however, problems which remain. One problem is
   that the regulations do not require a minimum probability that
   contaminated sites will be correctly identified. Another problem is that
   the effect of testing several correlated constituents on the probable
   outcome of the statistical tests has not been quantified.
   Results from computer simulations to determine power functions for
   realistic monitoring situations are presented here. Power functions for
   two different statistical procedures: the Student's t-test, and the
   multivariate Hotelling's T-2 test, are compared. The comparisons
   indicate that the multivariate test is often more powerful when the
   tests are applied with significance levels to control the probability of
   falsely identifying clean sites as contaminated. This program could also
   be used to verify that statistical procedures achieve some minimum power
   standard at a regulated waste unit.}},

Abstract = {{A method is proposed for the estimation of ground-water recharge rates
   in karstic aquifers by the analysis of hydrograph recession and multiple
   regression. Several methods are mentioned of estimating recharge rates
   by recession analysis of discharge at springs and from which recharge
   records can be obtained, Recharge (R) can also be estimated from
   precipitation (P) and air temperature (T) by the formula R = aP - bT +
   c. The components a, b, and c were derived from time-series data of four
   aquifers in the Mediterranean zone. For the first two of these aquifers,
   the recharge was calculated by integrating spring discharge between two
   points with the equal flow. For the third aquifer, a more elaborate
   calculation was based on multiple aquifers with semilogarithmic
   depletions, A numerical model, SIMERO, was used for the fourth, Given
   the appropriate correlation coefficients, the procedure is advantageous
   because of its simplicity. Limiting relationships between P and T are
   deduced.}},

Abstract = {{Bromide and boron were used as tracers during an injection experiment
   conducted at an artificial recharge facility near Stanton, Texas, The
   Ogallala aquifer at the Stanton site represents a heterogeneous alluvial
   environment and provides the opportunity to report scale dependent
   dispersivities at observation distances of 2 to 15 m in this setting,
   Values of longitudinal dispersivities are compared with other published
   values. Water samples were collected at selected depths both from
   piezometers and from fully screened observation wells at radii of 2, 5,
   10 and 15 m. An exact analytical solution is used to simulate the
   concentration breakthrough curves and estimate longitudinal
   dispersivities and velocity parameters, Greater confidence can be placed
   on these data because the estimated parameters are error bounded using
   the bootstrap method, The non-conservative behavior of boron transport
   in clay rich sections of the aquifer were quantified with distribution
   coefficients by using bromide as a conservative reference tracer.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1077-1088}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The time for disappearance of stationary, single-component
   immiscible-phase liquid (NAPL) from planar fractures due to dissolution
   and subsequent diffusion is directly dependent on the ratio of mass
   storage capacity of dissolved and sorbed contaminant in the matrix to
   the initial storage capacity for immiscible-phase liquid in the
   fractures. This was determined from an analytical solution for
   three-dimensional mass transfer into water-saturated matrix blocks of
   clay or sedimentary rock represented as rectangular parallelepipeds. A
   ratio greater than one indicates the number of times the fracture void
   volume can be completely replenished,vith the immiscible phase before
   disappearance ceases. However, each successive fracture replenishment
   requires longer time for disappearance due to consumption of part of the
   matrix storage capacity caused by previous fracture loadings.
   Ultimately,,vith continued NAPL replenishment in the fractures, this
   mass redistribution causes the dissolved concentration in the matrix to
   equal the aqueous solubility, at which point continued disappearance
   cannot occur. Mass storage capacity ratios for matrix and fracture
   conditions typical of clays and sedimentary rocks: are greater than one
   for a variety of the common chlorinated solvents. The initial
   disappearance times for a trichloroethylene (TCE) DNAPL in a fractured
   clay of 10(-4) fracture porosity and 35 percent matrix porosity with
   parallel, planar fractures, range from 0.01 to 113 days for fracture
   spacings of 1 cm and 1 m, respectively. Disappearance times for TCE
   DNAPL are much larger for a generic sandstone with the same fracture
   porosity and geometry and 10 percent matrix porosity, and range from
   0.44 to 4400 days, due to reduced storage capacity in the matrix. These
   disappearance times, which are short relative to the ages of subsurface
   contamination at many industrial sites, likely cause many DNAPL source
   zones, or parts of source zones, to have little or no actual DNAPL
   phase. However, the matrix retains the equivalent contaminant mass
   acting as a long term source zone.}},

Abstract = {{Cost-effective monitoring strategies exist for estimating mean depth to
   the water table and for characterizing fluctuations about that mean,
   These strategies can also be used to evaluate the utility of sparse
   water level data sets for making such estimates, This type of
   information is needed to design or reduce costs of observation well
   networks, to characterize regional water-table fluctuations for use in
   maps or models, and to calibrate ground-water models using hydraulic
   head estimates.
   The study is based on a statistical analysis of hourly water levels
   measured at observation wells by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) over
   a five-year period, Using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, sampling
   results for different monitoring strategies were compared with
   parameters of the underlying distribution of hourly water levels,
   Monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, and even triannual water-level monitoring
   was found to effectively estimate mean water table depth and standard
   deviation to within 30 cm. Quarterly and triannual sampling were found
   more cost-effective than monthly observations, and electronic monitoring
   more effective than manual measurements for sampling made more
   frequently than monthly, Results have broad application for studies
   involving surficial aquifers in humid regions of the world where annual
   rainfall exceeds 50 cm and is reasonably distributed throughout the
   year, Governmental agencies and universities have a wealth of water
   table monitoring records, collected either through ambient monitoring or
   as part of a permit requirement or study, These sparse data sets hold
   the promise of significantly increasing the hydrogeologic knowledge of
   water table behavior in many regions of the world.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1097-1106}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the significantly increased
   resolution of determining macropore recharge by combining physical,
   chemical, and isotopic methods of analysis; Techniques for quantifying
   macropore recharge were developed for both small-scale (1 to 10 km(2))
   and regional-scale areas in arid and semi-arid areas, The Southern High
   Plains region of Texas and New Mexico was used as a representative field
   site to test these methods. Macropore recharge in small-scale areas is
   considered to be the difference between total recharge through floors of
   topographically closed basins and interstitial recharge through the same
   area. On the regional scale, macropore recharge was considered to be the
   difference between regional average annual recharge and interstitial
   recharge measured in the unsaturated zone. Stable isotopic composition
   of ground water and precipitation was used as an independent estimate of
   macropore recharge on the regional scale, Results of this analysis
   Suggest that in the Southern High Plains recharge flux through
   macropores is between 60 and 80 percent of the total 11 mm/y. Between 15
   and 35 percent of the recharge occurs by interstitial recharge through
   the basin floors, Approximately 5 percent of the total recharge occurs
   as either interstitial or matrix recharge between the basin floors,
   representing approximately 95 percent of the area. The approach is
   applicable to other arid and semi-arid areas that focus rainfall into
   depressions or valleys.}},

Title = {{Determination of transmissivity from specific capacity tests in a karst
   aquifer}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{738-742}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Specific capacity tests are useful for estimating transmissivity in
   aquifers that have few good-quality pump tests, In karst aquifers, this
   has been done by (1) correcting specific capacity for turbulent well
   loss and using analytical relationships between transmissivity and
   specific capacity, and (2) correcting specific capacity for well loss
   and deriving an empirical relationship between transmissivity and
   specific capacity. This study focuses on the uncertainties of estimating
   well loss and presents an empirical relationship between transmissivity
   and uncorrected specific capacity for a karst aquifer.
   Well loss is difficult to estimate without good-quality step-drawdown
   tests. Pipe-flow theory tends to underestimate well loss, and an
   empirical relationship between specific capacity and well-loss constant
   has a large prediction interval that leads to well loss exceeding
   measured drawdown, To overcome uncertainties of estimating web loss,
   transmissivity and uncorrected specific capacity were related for
   aquifer tests from the Edwards aquifer in Texas, The resulting best-fit
   line is T = 0.76(S-c)(1.08) for T and S-c in m(2) d(-1), with a
   coefficient of determination, R-2, Of 0.89 and a 95-percent prediction
   interval spanning approximately 1.4 log cycles, Though the prediction
   interval is large, approximate but useful estimates of transmissivity
   can be determined because the relationship extends over five orders of
   magnitude from 1 to 100,000 m(2) d(-1). The relationship is applicable
   in at least one other karst aquifer and therefore may be useful for
   others.}},

Abstract = {{A new simulation-optimization model has been developed for the optimal
   design of ground-water remediation systems under a variety of field
   conditions. The model couples genetic algorithm (GA), a global search
   technique inspired by biological evolution, with MODFLOW and MT3D, two
   commonly used ground-water flow and solute transport codes. The model
   allows for multiple management periods in which optimal
   pumping/injection rates vary with time to reflect the changes in the
   flow and transport conditions during the remediation process. The
   objective function of the model incorporates multiple cost terms
   including the drilling cost, the installation cost, and the costs to
   extract and treat the contaminated ground water. The
   simulation-optimization model is first applied to a typical
   two-dimensional pump-and-treat example with one and three management
   periods to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the new
   model. The model is then applied to a large-scale three-dimensional
   field problem to determine the minimum pumping needed to contain an
   existing contaminant plume. The optimal solution as determined in this
   study is compared with a previous solution based on trial-and-error
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term (< 24 h) pilot tests play a key role in the selection and
   design of in situ air sparging systems. During air injection, changes in
   dissolved oxygen in ground water, water levels in wells, soil gas
   pressures, and soil gas contaminant concentrations are measured. These
   parameters are assumed to be indicators of air sparging feasibility and
   performance. In this work we assess the validity of this critical
   assumption. Data are presented from a study site where a typical
   short-term test was conducted for three days, followed by continued
   operation of a full-scale system for 110 days. Conventional sampling
   practices were augmented with more discrete and detailed assessment
   methods. In addition, a tracer gas was used to better investigate air
   distributions, vapor now paths, and vapor recovery efficiency. The data
   illustrate that conclusions regarding the performance and applicability
   of air sparging can vary dramatically depending on the monitoring
   approach used. Samples collected for chemical analyses from conventional
   monitoring wells were clearly affected by the air sparging during, and
   for some time after, air injection. Results from this site suggest that
   typical pilot test measurements might be useful for assessing
   infeasibility, but do not yield sufficient information to extrapolate to
   long-term performance.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model for simulation of the regional flow and salt-water
   intrustion in an integrated stream-aquifer system in coastal regions is
   developed, considering the dynamic interaction between the streams and
   the aquifer, The stream-aquifer model comprised of a two-dimensional
   depth-average finite-element model of the aquifer system and a
   quasi-steady node and reach model of the river network. The
   applicability of the model was demonstrated, through simulation of the
   spatial and temporal distributions of flow and salinity in the estuaries
   and in the underlying aquifer of the Southwest Region of Bangladesh. The
   important management aspects of water transfer and additional pumping
   and their effects on the system were evaluated. The interactions between
   the streams and the aquifer significantly influenced the flow and
   salt-water intrusion in the aquifer and the river network. An increased
   abstraction of ground water in the area caused a significant increase in
   the estuarine salinity. The salinity intrusion in the estuaries of the
   area, except in the southwest corner, could be reduced significantly by
   diverting the available water from the Ganges through the boundary river
   Gorai.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new analysis methodology for determining
   hydrogeological parameters from a single well slug test. The procedure
   involves converting pressure versus time data from a slug test into a
   form equivalent to that from a constant rate test using an exact
   relationship. Deconvolution techniques are applied to remove wellbore
   storage effects. The converted data are then analyzed using existing
   head and head derivative type curves for constant (downhole) rate
   conditions. It is demonstrated that the analysis of the converted data
   yields reliable estimates of aquifer transmissivity from conventional
   slug tests and even from short duration (i.e., small recovery) tests in
   low transmissivity rocks. This method allows successful analysis of data
   from slug tests that would be considered unanalyzable using conventional
   interpretation techniques. Moreover, the proposed method is able to
   determine aquifer storativity independent of the influence of wellbore
   skin factor. This is impossible using existing techniques such as those
   based on Cooper et al.(1967) or Ramey et al.(1975). The applicability of
   the proposed methodology is demonstrated using several synthetic and
   field examples.}},

Abstract = {{The rare earth element (REE) signature of ground waters from both felsic
   volcanic rocks on the Nevada Test Site and from the regional Paleozoic
   carbonate aquifer of southern Nevada resemble the REE: signature of the
   rocks through which they flow. Moreover, the REE signatures of Ash
   Meadows ground waters are similar to those of springs in the Furnace
   Creek region of Death Valley but different from shallow ground waters
   from predominantly tuffaceous alluvial deposits in the Amargosa Desert,
   perched ground waters from felsic volcanic rocks, and ground waters that
   have only flowed through the regional Paleozoic carbonate aquifer. The
   similar REE patterns of Ash Meadows and Furnace Creek ground waters
   support previous investigations that suggested ground waters discharging
   from the Furnace Creek springs are similar to the ground waters emerging
   from the Ash Meadows springs. The REE patterns indicate that the
   contribution of ground water from the Amargosa Desert to the Furnace
   Creek springs is of minor importance. Our REE analyses along with
   previous stable isotope, ground-water potentiometric surface
   relationships, and geologic structure analyses support ground-water flow
   from east to west in the fractured and faulted carbonate rocks beneath
   Ash Meadows, the Amargosa Desert, and the southern end of the Funeral
   Mountains. Our observations are contrary to some previous investigations
   that identified shallow ground waters from the central and northwestern
   Amargosa Desert as a substantial component of the ground water that
   discharges from the Furnace Creek springs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study on the application of the limit-state method
   for probabilistic multiphase pow modeling. The subsurface multiphase
   flow and heat transport simulator, TOUGH2 (Pruess, 1991), is combined
   with a computer shell for reliability analysis, CALREL (Liu et al.,
   1989). As applications of the combined code, the site at Yucca Mountain,
   Nevada for a potential high-level radioactive waste repository is
   modeled under assumed conditions. The probability distributions of
   various performance functions (liquid saturation, travel time, and flux)
   are calculated for statistically described infiltration rate and matrix
   hydrogeologic parameters. Numerical experiments indicates that the
   limit-state method compares fairly well with, and thus can be used as an
   alternative to, the Monte Carlo method for probabilistic multiphase flow
   simulations.}},

Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{825-841}},

Abstract = {{Data analysis methodologies are developed for using time-series
   measurements of effluent concentrations during continuous sampling to
   determine the vertical shape and location of a horizontally uniform
   contaminant plume and to estimate physical/chemical aquifer parameters
   such as vertical anisotropy, effective porosity, and retardation factor.
   Temporal water-quality variations during constant-flow sampling are
   calculated in the form of concentration type curves for a wide variety
   of plume shapes and positions and are shown to be directly related to
   the geometry and growth rate of the three-dimensional capture volume of
   the wed. An analytical type-curve solution is derived for
   discrete-interval sampling in homogeneous and isotropic/anisotropic
   aquifers containing plumes with complex vertical shapes that are
   described by the superposition of multiple Gaussian distributions.
   Results from two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulations of ground-water
   flow and particle transport demonstrate the sensitivity of concentration
   type curves to sandpack hydraulic conductivity, screen length, well
   diameter, flow through the well screen during discrete-interval
   sampling, aquifer anisotropy and heterogeneities, pumping rate,
   effective porosity, and chemical retardation. Two applications of the
   concentration type-curve method for determining plume and aquifer
   characteristics are presented. The first illustrates the use of
   discrete-interval sampling to evaluate the vertical shape and location
   of a hypothetical plume in a homogeneous, isotropic aquifer. In the
   second, extraction-well effluent data collected during a field
   experiment were used to evaluate the vertical concentration distribution
   in a sulfate plume and estimate the vertical anisotropy ratio of the
   aquifer. The results demonstrate the importance of developing
   consistency in purge and sample volumes to minimize artificial
   measurement variability in monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{Dimensional analysis is used to show the effects of aquifer anisotropy
   on capture zone geometry for a partially penetrating well that is
   screened from the top of a confined aquifer. Dimensionless similarity
   criteria are identified which allow an extension of results for
   advective transport modeling from isotropic conditions to anisotropic
   ones. Using published results of modeling capture zones in isotropic
   aquifers, it is shown that anisotropy is important in determining the
   size and shape of the capture zone under two conditions:(1) the pumping
   rate is small compared to the scaled regional flow velocity, and (2) the
   well has a low degree of penetration. Examples are used to show that
   disregard of even modest aquifer anisotropy can significantly affect
   estimates of capture zone.}},

Abstract = {{Closed-form expressions for quantifying the unsaturated soil hydraulic
   properties are widely used in computer programs to model subsurface flow
   and transport in porous media and to investigate indirect methods for
   estimating these properties. For example, water retention data, which
   relate soil-water pressure head (h) and effective water saturation
   (S-c), are frequently used to predict the unsaturated hydraulic
   conductivity (K), However, the suitability of different functions to
   describe unsaturated hydraulic data has rarely been investigated
   comprehensively. We attempted to fit 14 retention and 11 conductivity
   functions to 903 sets of water retention and hydraulic conductivity data
   measured on soil and rock samples or horizons reported in the
   unsaturated hydraulic database UNSODA, Some of the best mean values for
   r(2) and MSE for fitting S-c(h) data were obtained with the retention
   functions reported by van Genuchten (1980), Globus (1987), and Hutson
   and Cass (1987), A function reported by Gardner (1958) could describe
   K(h) data quite well whereas functions reported by Brooks and Corey
   (1964) and van Genuchten (1980), which are respectively based on the
   conductivity models by Burdine and Mualem, yielded a relatively good
   description of K(S-c) data.}},

Abstract = {{Data from 244 single-well pumping tests of the karstified Lucayan
   Limestone on 14 different islands distributed through the Bahamian
   Archipelago, demonstrate a strong log-linear relationship between annual
   rainfall and the effective mean island effective hydraulic conductivity,
   which averages over two orders of magnitude higher in the wetter
   northern Bahamas (mean annual rainfall 1550 mm) than in the more arid
   southern islands (mean annual rainfall 810 mm). This relationship is
   independent of the saturated depth of the boreholes tested, although the
   hydraulic conductivity of the lower part of the formation is
   significantly greater (about 0.6-0.7 order of magnitude) than the upper
   unit, reflecting progressive secondary porosity generation with time.
   The direct effect of increasing ground-water flux on rates of
   dissolutional porosity generation in the wetter northern islands is
   supplemented by the greater geochemical potential for carbonate
   dissolution resulting from higher primary vegetative production. This
   both increases soil pCO(2) via root respiration (a process augmented by
   higher soil moisture permitting more microbial activity), and the
   availability of organic matter for in situ oxidation within the aquifer.
   Effective hydraulic conductivity may also be directly related to island
   size. Islands in the north of the Archipelago are larger than those in
   the south, thus the fresh-water lens and fresh-/salt-water mixing zone
   are greater in size and expose more bedrock to dissolution.}},

Abstract = {{Four methods were applied to obtain confidence intervals for selected
   dependent variables from a nonlinear regression formulation of a
   ground-water flow model. The methods examined are (1) the linearization
   method, (2) the likelihood method, (3) a simple, percentile bootstrap
   method, and (4) a regression-based percentile bootstrap method that is a
   generalization of the first one.
   The methods were applied to a highly nonlinear regression model of a
   hypothetical ground-water system involving an infiltrating stream
   crossing a heterogeneous aquifer. Confidence intervals were computed for
   a hydraulic head and a parameter that is proportional to the streamflow
   infiltration rate. All confidence intervals computed by the likelihood
   method are virtually exact. Confidence intervals for hydraulic head by
   the linearization, likelihood, and the second bootstrap methods are
   similar, but confidence intervals by the first bootstrap method are very
   different and highly inaccurate. Confidence intervals for the streamflow
   infiltration parameter by the linearization and first bootstrap methods
   are identical and inaccurate; confidence intervals by the second
   bootstrap method lie between those by the likelihood and the other two
   methods. These characteristics of the confidence intervals result
   because (1) the regression model is highly nonlinear, and (2) much of
   the nonlinearity can be removed by some transformation of model
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a geostatistical analysis of transmissivity in the
   Euganean geothermal field (northeast Italy). Few transmissivity values
   are known while specific capacity values are more common. However,
   transmissivity is more important than specific capacity in the
   characterization of aquifers. In this work, therefore, after a simple
   statistical analysis, an empirical relation with a high determination
   coefficient (r(2) = 0.95) is found between the above values.
   Subsequently,In T structural characteristics of the variable are studied
   by variogram analysis, identifying a second-order pseudostationarity and
   two geometrical anisotropies. The second-order pseudostationarity and
   the variogram fit allow a linear kriging procedure to be used to produce
   a map of transmissivity and kriging standard deviation of the Euganean
   geothermal field. The fit between geostatistical and hydrogeological
   analyses shows that a geostatistical approach is useful for both mapping
   purposes and hydrogeological interpretation.}},

   approach, The reproducibility tests show that there are clear
   differences in length and location of individual line segments between
   interpreters, but that a large proportion of the inferred structural
   features are detected by all interpreters, Fifty percent of the features
   on both imagery types are detected by any two interpreters and 40
   percent by all interpreters. Lineaments classed as more hydrologically
   significant show a reproducibility of up to 90 percent between
   interpreters and justify the use of classifiers in lineament mapping.
   The application of the feature agreement approach, including
   classification by hydrological significance, shows the greatest promise
   for targeting successful well sites.}},

Abstract = {{Leakage to ground water resulting from the expansion and contraction of
   reservoirs cannot be easily simulated by most ground-water flow models.
   An algorithm, entitled the Reservoir Package, was developed for the
   United States Geological Survey (USGS) three-dimensional
   finite-difference modular ground-water flow model MODFLOW. The Reservoir
   Package automates the process of specifying head-dependent boundary
   cells, eliminating the need to divide a simulation into many stress
   periods while improving accuracy in simulating changes in ground-water
   levels resulting from transient reservoir stage. Leakage between the
   reservoir and the underlying aquifer is simulated for each model cell
   corrresponding to the inundated area by multiplying the head difference
   between the reservoir and the aquifer with the hydraulic conductance of
   the reservoir-bed sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen were used to trace the sources of
   recharge from sinking streams to wells and springs several kilometers
   downgradient in the karst Madison aquifer near Rapid City, South Dakota.
   Temporal sampling of streamflow above the swallets identified a distinct
   isotopic signature that was used to define the spatial dimensions of
   recharge to the aquifer. When more than one sinking stream was
   determined to be recharging a well or spring, the proportions were
   approximated using a two-component mixing model. From the isotopic
   analysis, it is possible to link sinking stream recharge to individual
   wells or springs in the Rapid City area and illustrate there is
   significant lateral movement of ground water across surface drainage
   basins. These results emphasize that well-head protection strategies
   developed for carbonate aquifers that provide industrial and municipal
   water supplies need to consider lateral movement of ground-water flow
   from adjacent surface drainage basins.}},

Abstract = {{H-3, He-3, He-4, and Ne data were obtained from a shallow ground-water
   system being recharged by bank infiltration from the Danube River in
   northwestern Hungary. After correting for excess air,He-4 and Ne
   concentrations reflect a recharge temperature of about 9 degrees C,
   close to the mean annual temperature of the Danube (10.4 degrees C).
   Values of H-3 plus He-3(trit) (''initial tritium'') as a function of the
   tritium/He-3 age are consistent with time series measurements of tritium
   in the Danube. Tritium/He-3 ages increase linearly as a function of
   distance from the Danube along ground-water flow lines. A horizontal
   flow velocity of about 530 m yr(-1) was derived from the age gradient.
   Most of the deviations between measured Danube tritium data and
   ground-water tritium/He-3 data can be explained by dispersive mixing.}},

   MINTEQA2 contains over 1,500 aqueous species entries with

   a LOTUS 123 program that scans MINTEQA2 data base entries and directly
   identifies errors in stoichiometry, species charge, and formula weight.
   GIBBTEQ indirectly facilitates identification of errors of equilibrium
   and enthalpy data in MINTEQA2 data base entries by printing those
   entries in readable format, Anomalies of equilibrium constant, standard
   free energy and enthalpy of mineral species, and redox potential (for
   electron-containing reactions) are amenable to user detection in the
   program output. MINTEQA2 errors of various types are quantified from
   GIBBTEQ results. Program availability inquiries can be sent via e-mail

Abstract = {{This paper addresses questions fundamental to the design and operation
   of aquifer bioremediation based on cometabolic degradation. A model of a
   full-scale, in situ system for bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes
   relying on cometabolic degradation was developed and applied to a
   hypothetical aquifer being considered for a large-scale field
   demonstration of in situ bioremediation with recirculation. The model
   was used to identify feasible substrate (electron donor and electron
   acceptor) delivery schedules. Trichloroethylene (TCE) was the target
   contaminant. Methane and phenol were considered as electron donors. The
   delivery of the electron donors and the electron acceptor, oxygen, was
   varied to evaluate the rate and extent of bioremediation under different
   substrate delivery schedules. Maximum removal of TCE was predicted when
   substrates are delivered at ratios near the stoichiometric requirement
   of electron donor and acceptor for net microbial growth.
   Additionally, the decrease in TCE removal that results from using
   substrate delivery schedules other than those achieving the maximum
   removal of TCE was quantified. This decrease was greater for the
   methane-oxygen system because the two gaseous substrates compete for
   transfer into the recirculated ground water. If one substrate is
   introduced in excess of the amount required for net microbial growth, it
   accumulates, thus limiting the ability to introduce the second
   substrate. This imbalance both limits the introduction of the second
   substrate and accelerates the accumulation of the substrate added in
   excess. The phenol-oxygen system is less sensitive to deviation away
   from the best observed substrate delivery schedule because phenol is a
   relatively soluble liquid and its introduction does not compete with the
   mass transfer of oxygen.}},

Title = {{The role of sorption in the transport of Klebsiella oxytoca through
   saturated silica sand}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{574-584}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to investigate the role of sorption during
   the transport of the bacterium Klebsiella oxytoca through saturated
   silica sand. The sorption process was visualized at the pore scale in a
   minicell (3 mm deep X 6.0 mm wide X 7.0 cm long) using scanning confocal
   laser microscopy. The sorption process was also studied by conducting
   column experiments at three scales (3.8, 10, and 40 cm long), Results of
   image analyses of the sorbed and unattached cells in pore throats and
   the bacterial breakthrough data from the column experiments exhibited
   similar trends. Breakthrough peaks were attenuated with respect to the
   input concentrations and well-defined tailing was observed.
   Visualization suggested that the sorption process was dominated by
   reversible and irreversible sorption (k(irr)). In the case of reversible
   sorption, the rate of forward sorption (k(f)) was different from the
   rate for reversible sorption (k(r)). Visualization also showed that the
   bacterial coverage on the sand grains, although extensive, covered <
   0.5\% of the available surface area. A 1D solution for
   advective-dispersive transport was used to estimate k(irr), k(f), and
   k(r) with appropriate values for the coefficient of hydrodynamic
   dispersion and average linear pore-water velocity (determined from Cl
   data). Simulated best fits to the bacterial peaks were good for the 3.8
   cm columns but underestimated peak heights in the 10 and 40 cm columns
   by one order of magnitude. Best-fit k(irr) values decreased with
   increasing scale (0.6, 0.13, and 0.062 hr(-1) for the 3.8, 10, and 40 cm
   columns, respectively) and showed that a k(irr) value determined at one
   scale cannot be used to determine concentrations of K. oxytoca with time
   at another scale. These results suggested that k(irr) was a function of
   t(o) (length of column over velocity). The equivalent irreversible
   sorption parameter (A, where A = t(o) . k(irr)) was a constant (mean
   value of 3.36) for the three scales investigated. This observation
   suggested that the use of the value A, determined at one scale of
   investigation, may prove effective in approximating the value of k(irr)
   predicting bacterial transport at other scales. Best-fit determinations
   yielded the same k(f) and k(r) values at all three scales (0.1 and 0.02
   hr(-1)). This suggested that reversible sorption may be independent of
   column length. This study emphasized the need for more comprehensive
   investigations of the role of sorption in the transport of
   microorganisms in the subsurface.}},
