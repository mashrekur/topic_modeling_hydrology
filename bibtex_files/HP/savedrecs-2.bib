Abstract = {{The surface area to mass ratio or specific surface area (SSA) is an
   often neglected characteristic of the snowpack that varies substantially
   with time, and with the shape of the individual snow crystal for fresh
   snow. The SSA for the dendritic shape of snow crystals was computed
   using a series of images photographed by W. A. Bentley. The specific
   images were dendritic crystals (P1d, P1e, P1f) and crystals that take a
   partial dendritic form and have ends or extensions (P2a, P2b, P2d, P2e,
   P2f, P2g) according to the Magono and Lee snow crystal classification.
   Image analysis, using known geometric relationships between length and
   width, and particle size distributions, examined the spatial properties
   of 50 sample snow crystals. Probability distribution functions were
   derived for SSA and these compared well with measured and other computed
   estimates of fresh snow SSA. For the non-rimed condition, the average
   SSA was 0.182 m(2)/g with a range from 0.09 to 0.33 m(2)/g. The presence
   of rime is discussed, and depending on the shape of the rime particles
   and the degree of surface coverage, the SSA can be doubled (20\%
   coverage for needle or plate shaped rime). Fractal analysis was
   performed to determine various geometric relationships that characterize
   the dendritic form of snow crystal. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Sublimation fluxes during blowing snow have been estimated to return
   10-50\% of seasonal snowfall to the atmosphere in North American prairie
   and arctic environments. These fluxes are calculated as part of blowing
   snow two-phase particle transport models with provision for phase change
   based upon a particle-scale energy balance. Blowing snow models have
   normally been evaluated based upon their ability to reproduce diagnostic
   mass flux gradient measurements and regional-scale snow redistribution
   patterns and snow mass. Direct evidence is presented here that large
   latent heat fluxes (40-60 W m(-2)) that result in sublimation rates of
   0.05-0.075 mm snow water equivalent hour(-1), are associated with
   mid-winter, high-latitude blowing snow events. For events with wind
   speeds above the threshold level for snow transport, these fluxes are in
   the range of those predicted by the Prairie Blowing Snow Model. The
   fluxes are well in excess of those found during spring snowmelt and
   which can be predicted by standard bulk aerodynamic transfer equations,
   suggesting that blowing snow physics will have to be incorporated in
   land surface schemes and hydrological models in order to properly
   represent snow surface mass and energy exchange during blowing snow
   events. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The physical characteristics and CO2 concentrations of snow cover in the
   western Canadian arctic were examined at sites with different landscape
   forms (valley floor, hillslope, plateau). The greater exposure of
   plateau snow cover to blowing snow results in differences in the
   structure of the snow cover and different snow strata compared with snow
   covers on the other landscape forms. Both higher in-pack concentrations
   of CO2 and the largest vertical CO2 concentration gradients were found
   in plateau snow cover, the smallest in the deeper hillslope and valley
   snows. CO2 gradients in all landscape snow covers followed two patterns,
   i.e. where concentrations at the soil-snow interface are higher than
   those just below (5 cm) and the snow-atmosphere interface and vice
   versa. The latter pattern is due to the transport of the gas from the
   lower levels to the upper levels of the snowpack by wind-induced
   advection (windpumping) and is indicative of non steady-state,
   nondiffusive processes. These latter processes should thus be considered
   in any studies on CO2 fluxes from Arctic soil where snow cover
   topography and winds are conducive to windpumping and where
   concentration gradients resulting from diffusive processes have not been
   clearly identified. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Melt pathways in a natural seasonal snowpack were investigated using
   high frequency FMCW radar to examine the use of radar as a tool for
   investigating water flow through snow, and to develop preliminary
   estimates of the number of flow fingers present and the amount of
   meltwater that they transport. Our data show that the radar can be used
   to sense melt features at distances of approximately one metre within
   this snowpack. Old refrozen fingers and new wet fingers both generate
   visible radar returns. Excavation of channels within the snowpack
   verified that the radar signals were from flow fingering. By counting
   the number of channels observed in the radar images and using snow
   lysimeter measurements of outflow from the snowpack, we estimated that
   in the early stages of the main snow melt season, this snowpack
   contained approximately three channels/m(2), and that the flow through
   each channel was approximately 0.4 mm of water/channel/hour. Published

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivity of meltwaters in the Batura river which drains
   from the portal of Batura glacier in the Karakoram mountains was
   recorded continuously, together with stage, throughout an ablation
   season with the aim of estimating the annual total solute flux from the
   56\% glacier-covered basin. Through-time variations of meltwater
   cationic concentration were obtained from the electrical conductivity
   record using a rating curve established between sums of cations
   determined in periodically-collected samples of meltwater and electrical
   conductivity measured at the times of sampling. Hourly average cationic
   flux was then obtained as the product of cationic concentration and
   discharge, error arising as a result of inaccuracy in river gauging and
   use of the rating relationship. Electrical conductivity varied diurnally
   inversely with discharge, overall level decreasing as discharge
   increased in spring, continuing subdued through July and August
   irrespective of episodic discharge fluctuations. In contrast, solute
   flux mimicked discharge variation, low solute concentrations being
   offset by the volume of water flowing. Total annual cationic flux from
   Batura basin was 1.03 Meq +/- similar to 15\%. Assuming almost all of
   the flux was derived subglacially, the solute flux from beneath Batura
   glacier was 2.64 +/- 0.40 eq m(-2) a(-1). These rates of cationic
   denudation, substantially higher than the continental average, are at
   the top end of the global range of reasonably-reliable estimates for
   other smaller glacierized basins. Carbonate lithology, high annual
   runoff, high sediment concentration in meltwaters, and long subglacial
   pathways account for the high solute flux from Batura glacier. Through
   longer residence times of meltwater in transit under ice and higher
   discharges, dissolution kinetics and flow couple to enhance solute
   fluxes from larger glaciers. Although subglacial chemical denudation in
   the Karakoram mountains is significant in carbon cycling at the
   continental scale, such carbonate dissolution probably contributes
   little to net consumption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Abstract = {{Algorithms were applied to weather radar data to improve the
   precipitation estimation for winter hydrologic modelling. The radar data
   were adjusted to consider the occurrence of mixed precipitation at above
   freezing air temperatures, the shape of snow particles, and a site
   specific scaling phenomenon. Radar data, uncorrected and corrected
   gridded gauge precipitation data were used as input to the linked
   WATFLOOD/CLASS hydrologic model for simulation of streamflow. WATFLOOD
   performed the horizontal water routing and CLASS performed the vertical
   energy and water budgeting. Modelling of the Grand River watershed that
   is within the coverage of the Atmospheric Environment Service C-band
   radar in King City, Ontario, Canada for the five winters from 1993 to
   1997 illustrated that on average the adjusted radar images produced
   +/-15\% of the observed runoff volumes whereas the corrected gauge
   precipitation yielded 35\% less runoff than observed. Substantial
   seasonal variation was observed. Radar provided more realistic winter
   precipitation quantities for streamflow modelling than the corrected
   gauge data. Application of the algorithms improved upon the raw radar
   estimates. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the 1998-1999 winter, the operational feasibility of using RADARSAT
   SAR data to estimate the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent
   (SWE) in a large hydroelectric complex managed by Hydro-Quebec (La
   Grande River watershed) has been successfully demonstrated. This
   watershed is located in the subarctic climatic region in the north-west
   of the Quebec province. The vegetation consists of moderately dense to
   open Black Spruce forests, open lands, burned lands and peat bogs. In
   the last few years, an original approach well adapted for this region
   has been developed to estimate the SWE from SAR data (ERS-1, RADARSAT).
   This approach is based on the fact that the snow cover characteristics
   influence the underlying soil temperature which influences the
   dielectric properties of the soil and then the recorded backscattering
   signal. Then, a linear relationship between the backscattering ratios of
   a winter image and a snow-free (fall) image, and the snowpack thermal
   resistance (thermal insulation properties) has been established.
   Consequently, the algorithm infers the SWE from the estimated thermal
   resistance and the measured mean density of the snowpack. This algorithm
   has been implemented within a MapInfo(TM) application that has been
   named EQeau. It allows mapping of the spatial distribution of the
   estimated SWE at the desired level (pixel, square grid, sub-watershed).
   During the 1998-1999 winter, EQeau has been used successfully in a
   pre-operational mode using calibrated Wide beam images (W1) from
   RADARSAT. The algorithm has given mean estimated SWE values similar to
   the SWE values derived from Hydro-Quebec snow transects (relative
   difference between 1\% and 13\%). Also, the SWE increase measured from
   January to March 1999 is clearly detected on the maps covering almost 77
   000 km(2) The next steps will be the evaluation of the ScanSAR images
   and the demonstration of the economical advantages of using RADARSAT
   data in a hydrological forecasting system. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The hydrological response of a catchment is the result of combined
   hillslope and channel network delays in the translation of rainfall to
   discharge at the catchment outlet. In this paper we examine three simple
   descriptions of the channel network response following an instantaneous
   hillslope runoff input within a general framework in which the role of
   network morphology is described using the probability density function
   (pdf) of network path lengths, and the role of hydrodynamic dispersion
   is described using a solution of the linear advection dispersion
   equation. We show that the pdf of path lengths, represented by the area
   function, can be adequately approximated by a triangular distribution
   with just two parameters (the mean and maximum network path lengths).
   The triangular pdf can be combined with a description of residence times
   in individual paths to derive an analytical expression for the
   hydrological response of the channel network. This expression provides a
   better approximation of the network response than both the original
   geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH), based on
   Horton-Strahler ratios, and a: single-channel representation, based on
   the concept of geomorphological dispersion. Using the same expression,
   we-show that geomorphological factors generally prevail in controlling
   the mean and variance of network residence times. In contrast,
   hydrodynamic dispersion is shown to have a significant influence on the

Abstract = {{Groundwater samples were collected from 11 springs in Ash Meadows
   National Wildlife Refuge in southern Nevada and seven springs from Death
   Valley National Park in eastern California. Concentrations of the major
   cations (Ca, Mg, Na and K) and 45 trace elements were determined in
   these groundwater samples. The resultant data were subjected to
   evaluation via the multivariate statistical technique principal
   components analysis (PCA), to investigate the chemical relationships
   between the Ash Meadows and Death Valley spring waters, to evaluate
   whether the results of the PCA support those of previous hydrogeological
   and isotopic studies and to determine if PCA can be used to help
   delineate potential groundwater flow patterns based on the chemical
   compositions of groundwaters. The results of the PCA indicated that
   groundwaters from the regional Paleozoic carbonate aquifers tall of the
   Ash Meadows springs and four springs from the Furnace Creek region of
   Death Valley) exhibited strong statistical associations, whereas other
   Death Valley groundwaters were chemically different. The results of the
   PCA support earlier studies.,where potentiometric head levels,
   delta(18)O and delta D, geological relationships and rare earth element
   data were used to evaluate groundwater flow, which suggest groundwater
   flows from Ash Meadows to the Furnace Creek springs in Death Valley. The
   PCA suggests that Furnace Creek groundwaters are moderately concentrated
   Ash Meadows groundwater, reflecting longer aquifer residence times for
   the Furnace Creek groundwaters, Moreover, PCA indicates that groundwater
   may flow from springs in the region surrounding Scotty's Castle:in Death
   Valley National Park, to a spring discharging on the valley floor. The
   study indicates that PCA:may provide rapid and relatively cost-effective
   methods to assess possible groundwater flow regimes' in systems-that
   have not been previously investigated. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The variation in snowmelt energy and energy components were evaluated
   with respect to forest density. Surface snowmelt rates, surface
   evaporation from snow cover and meteorological elements were measured in
   the open and under sparse (411 trees/ha) and dense (1433 trees/ha) larch
   canopies. The surface snowmelt rate decreased as the forest density
   increased. Based on the observations and energy balance analyses, we
   concluded the following. (1) Albedo decreased while the bulk coefficient
   for latent heat increased with forest density. (2) The duration of
   snowmelt increased with forest density because the energy for nocturnal
   cooling of the snow cover decreased. (3) When comparing the open and
   forested sites, the changes in snowmelt energy with forest density were
   caused by sensible heat flux. However, the contribution of net radiation
   was highest in the forested sites. Therefore, the effects of forest
   cover on the snowmelt energy were different when comparing both the open
   and forested sites and the sparse and densely forested sites. (4) The
   ratio of net radiation to snowmelt energy increased with forest density;
   although both snowmelt energy and net radiation decreased with increased
   forest density, the snowmelt energy decreased more rapidly. Sensible
   heat also decreased as forest density increased. Both albedo and
   downward long-wave radiation influenced: net-radiation. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Finite element modelling of the saturated-unsaturated surface-subsurface
   flow mechanisms operative in a small salinized catchment in
   south-western Australia was used to help define the flow system and
   explain the causes of waterlogging and salinization there. Data
   available at the site from a previous study were used to obtain a first
   approximation to the flow system. Altering the properties of some of the
   strata gave a closer calibration. It was found that the modelled
   saturated hydraulic conductivity of the B horizon in the duplex soil
   zone needed to be at least an order of magnitude lower than that
   measured in order to reproduce the perching conditions observed in the
   field. Also, the model indicated the influence of a doleritic dyke,
   whose presence was confirmed by field measurement.
   Our analysis showed that there were two main flow systems:operating in
   the hillslope, The first, and most dominant, was the recharge occurring
   through the upslope gradational soil zone and percolating down to both
   the deeply weathered regolith and the basal aquifer. The second flow
   system is an unsaturated flow system operating in the high permeability
   A horizon in the downslope duplex soil zone. The first system is
   primarily responsible for the saline seepage zone in the valley bottom.
   The second contributes to the waterlogging and perching occurring
   upslope of the seepage zone.
   Vertical flow through the higher permeability B horizon in the
   gradational soil zone in the upper slopes is a major contributor of
   recharge. Recharge by flow through macropores occurs where, but only
   where, perched aquifers develop and allow the macropores to be
   activated. Areas: with perched aquifers occurred in downslope locations
   and near a doleritic dyke located upslope. Thus, the area where
   macropore recharge occurred was not large.
   The recharge rate required to maintain the piezometric levels at present
   values is only about 30 mm/yr (about 5\% of the annual rainfall). The
   piezometric levels under the upper part of the catchment varied greatly
   with only small changes in recharge rate. A 50\% reduction in recharge
   rate had the effect of reducing the length of the seepage zone at the
   end of winter by 40\%. Changes in recharge: rate had little effect on
   the extent of the perched aquifer at the end of winter. Deep-rooted
   perennial forages, shrubs or trees on the gradational soil zone in the
   upper part of the catchment and on the zones upslope of geological
   barriers to flow would be required to reduce the recharge and to allow
   for rehabilitation of the saline valley floor, Waterlogging associated
   with the perched water table in the bottom part of the catchment would
   be best addressed by tree plantations located just upslope of the
   salinized zone in the valley floor. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Post-logging changes in catchment sediment yield have traditionally been
   attributed to increases in hillslope erosion and delivery rates as a
   result of forest harvesting activities. Linking hillslope erosion to
   catchment yield in forestry environments remains difficult, however,
   primarily because of the scarcity of data on the nature of hillslope
   sediment storage and delivery processes. A large rainfall simulator (350
   m(2)) was used to apply rainstorms to a logged hillslope containing a
   snig track (skid trail) and a general logging Or harvesting area (GHA)
   on 10 forest compartments in south-eastern Australia. The experiments
   confirmed that the compacted, disturbed surfaces, such as roads and
   tracks, are the dominant sources of sediment in forestry areas. Sediment
   transport rates were limited by available sediment supply on both the
   snig track and the GHA, introducing important implications for the
   modelling of these surfaces using sediment transport capacity theories.
   Sediment delivery from the snig track to the adjacent GHA, via a
   cross-bank (drainage diversion), was strongly influenced by the
   percentage fine fraction in the eroded sediment. Preferential deposition
   of coarse aggregates was measured at erosion control structures and on
   the adjacent GHA. Over 50\% of fine-grained material were deposited on
   the hillslope over a relatively short, flow path length of <5 m,
   highlighting the effectiveness of runoff diversion as a practice in
   reducing sediment flux. The transfer of water and sediment from
   disturbed to less disturbed parts of the landscape, and the associated
   potential for sediment storage, needs to be considered as part of any
   catchment impact assessment. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Krusne hory (Erzgebirge or Ore Mountains) has been: heavily;
   affected by high atmospheric pollutant deposition caused by fossil fuel
   combustion in an adjacent Tertiary coal basin. Long-term routine
   sampling of bulk precipitation (1977-1996) and stream water (1977-1998)
   in a forested area on the south-eastern slope of the mountains were used
   to evaluate trends and patterns in solute concentration and flux with
   respect to controlling processes. From 1977 to 1996, the annual
   volume-weighted Ca2+ and SO42- concentrations decreased in bulk
   precipitation. However, after 1989, when a pronounced and continuous
   decrease occurred in coal production, annual volume-weighted
   concentrations decreased for most solutes, except H+. The concentration
   decreases were marked, with 1996 levels at or below 50\% of those in
   1989. The lack of a trend in H+ is attributed to similar decreases in
   both acid anions and neutralizing base cations. Stream water
   concentrations of most solutes, i.e. H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, SO42- and NO3-,
   were highest at the onset of sampling in 1977, decreased markedly from
   1977 to 1983 and decreased more gradually from 1983 to 1998. The spruce
   forest die-back and removal reduced dry deposition of these solutes by
   reducing the:filtering action, which was provided by the forest canopy.
   A notable decrease in stream water Ca2+ concentrations occurred after
   1995 and may be due to the depletion of Ca2+, which was provided by
   catchment liming in 1986, 1988 and 1989. Solute flux trends in bulk
   atmospheric deposition and stream water generally were not significant
   and the lack of trend is attributed to the large interannual variability
   in precipitation quantity and-runoff, respectively. All solutes except
   Na+ varied seasonally. The average seasonal concentrations varied
   between the solutes, but for most solutes were highest in winter and
   spring and lowest in summer, correlating with the seasonal trend in
   runoff. For Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO42-, the concentration minimum occurs in
   September and the maximum occurs in February or March, correlating with
   the seasonal baseflow. These solutes;are primarily controlled by the
   contribution of soil water and groundwater to stream flow. During
   snowmelt, the meltwater generally causes concentrations to decrease as
   soil water and groundwater are diluted. For NO3, average minimum
   concentrations occur in August at the end of the growing season
   concurrent with the lowest stream flow, and the maximum occurs in
   February and March with high stream flow during snowmelt. Seasonal:
   stream water NO3- concentration variations are large compared with the
   long-term decrease. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Penman model that estimates the evaporation as a function of salinity,
   humidity, air temperature and wind speed. Other parameters such as water
   temperature are included implicitly in the model. The results obtained
   were verified as satisfactory agreement was achieved by comparison with

Abstract = {{River basins in mountainous regions are characterized by strong
   variations in topography, vegetation, soils, climatic conditions and
   snow cover conditions, and all are strongly related to altitude. The
   high spatial variation needs to be considered when modelling
   hydrological processes in such catchments. A complex hydrological model,
   with a great potential to account for spatial variability, was developed
   and applied for the hourly simulation of evapotranspiration, soil
   moisture, water balance and the runoff components for the period 1993
   and 1994 in 12 subcatchments of the alpine/pre-alpine basin of the River
   Thur (area 1703 km(2)). The basin is located in the north-east of the
   Swiss part of the Rhine Basin and has an elevation range from 350 to
   2500 m a.s.l. A considerable part of the Thur Basin is high mountain
   area, some of it above the tree-line and a great part of the basin is
   snow covered during the winter season.
   In the distributed hydrological model, the 12 sub-basins:of the Thur
   catchment were spatially subdivided into sub-areas (hydrologically
   similar response units - HRUs or hydrotopes) using a GIS. Within the
   HRUs a hydrologically similar behaviour was assumed. Spatial
   interpolations of the meteorological input variables were employed for
   each altitudinal zone. The structure of the-model components for snow
   accumulation and melt, interception, soil water storage and uptake by
   evapotranspiration, runoff generation and flow routing are briefly
   outlined. The results of the simulated potential evapotranspiration
   reflect the dominant role of altitudinal change in radiation and albedo
   of exposure, followed by the-influence of slope. The actual
   evapotranspiration shows, in comparison with the potential
   evapotranspiration, a greater variability in the lower and medium
   altitudinal zones and a smaller variability in the upper elevation
   zones, which was associated with limitations of available moisture in
   soil and surface depression storages as well as with the evaporative
   demand of the local vegetation. The higher altitudinal dependency and
   variability of runoff results from the strong increase in precipitation
   and the decrease in evaporation with increased altitude. An increasing
   influence of snow cover on runoff as well as evapotranspiration with
   altitude is obvious. The computed actual evapotranspiration and runoff
   were evaluated against the observed values of a weighting lysimeter and
   against runoff hydrographs, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Flume studies were conducted in order to evaluate the influence
   of:slope, sediment size, discharge and inflow sediment concentration on
   sediment deposition by overland flow. Additionally, experiments were
   carried out to measure transport capacity of overland flow at low
   slopes, using a wide range of discharges. The experimental data show
   that the hydraulic conditions where net deposition occurs can be divided
   into two domains. The first domain is characterized by hydraulic
   conditions where transport capacity is not significant. In the second
   domain net deposition still occurs but transport capacity is
   significant. The size of the latter domain is dependent on the sediment
   size distribution, on the hydraulic roughness and on the inflow sediment
   concentration. The experiments clearly indicate the necessity of
   incorporating a threshold value in any deposition equation, These
   experiments demonstrate that shear stress is a valuable threshold for
   deposition modelling. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Five tracer experiments have been performed in a coarse-textured soil
   near the new main airport at Gardermoen, Norway. In two lysimeter walls,
   30 and 40 measuring points form the basis for spatial moment
   calculations. Although experiments were performed under:different
   meteorological conditions (autumn and snowmelt) and at two different
   sites, the ratios of centres of vertical mass over cumulative
   infiltration were of the same order of magnitude, indicating a
   gravity-dominated flow. Two-dimensional transport simulations with SUTRA
   (Voss, 1984), with a priori estimated input parameters and random fields
   of soil hydraulic properties revealed a relatively good agreement with
   the experimental results. Three possible sources of heterogeneity
   affecting the vertical displacement of solute during snowmelt were
   identified: variability of soil physical properties, soil surface
   elevations and variability of ground frost during the melting period. To
   obtain accurate predictions, soil heterogeneity was the most important
   factor to characterize for the coarse-textured soil under consideration.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine and discuss field-scale
   phosphorus losses via subsurface tile drains. A total phosphorous
   (Tot-P) export, which averaged 0.29 kg ha(-1) year(-1), was measured
   over a six-year period from the 4.43 ha drainage system of a Eutric
   Cambisol in Central Sweden. The main part (63\%) was in particulate form
   (PP) while the remainder was either in phosphate form (PO4-P) or in
   other dissolved or colloidal forms. A very small area, less than 1\% of
   the soil surface, was demonstrated to be hydraulically active by using a
   staining technique in soil monoliths taken from the field. The stained
   macropores were few, but were continuous downward, and were relatively
   evenly distributed among the eight 7 dm(2) areas that were investigated.
   The transport from the field mainly occurred in episodes during which
   the relationship between phosphorus concentration and discharge was
   characterized by hysteresis loops. On average, half of the yearly P
   transport occurred in 140 hours. Compared with flow-proportional and
   frequent sampling, manual and fortnightly sampling underestimated the
   transport of Tot-P and suspended solids (SS) by 59 and 42\%,
   respectively, during the six years studied. Amounts of different
   phosphorus forms exported through the tile drains were very similar to
   those reported from other clay soils in Northern Europe and North
   America. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A field study site was installed in east-central Pennsylvania to examine
   processes controlling groundwater recharge. It was instrumented to
   monitor climatic inputs, soil water dynamics and groundwater response.
   Characterization of the layered fractured bedrock underlying the site by
   rock coring, seismic surveys and interval packer testing showed
   consistencies between layer depths, fracture frequencies, seismic
   velocities and hydraulic conductivities. Monthly summaries of rainfall
   and percolate over two years showed that percolate rates were generally
   high and closely related to precipitation during the dormant season.
   During the growing season, however, the relationship became erratic with
   large variabilities: occurring between individual lysimeter
   measurements. Eight dormant season rainfall events were examined in
   detail. Smaller events produced similar responses from 1 m deep
   percolate lysimeters, Approximately 10-15 mm of rain was required to
   initiate percolate, with the time delay in response dependent on how
   long it took this depth to accumulate; 5 to 6 mm of the rain was
   retained in storage, with the remainder becoming percolate. Larger
   rains, from 30-110 mm, caused correspondingly larger depths of percolate
   and larger water table responses, but generally similar patterns of site
   response. Groundwater at the site was typically about 6 m below the land
   surface during the dormant season. It responded 1-2 hours after the
   onset of percolate, and reached its maximum elevation anywhere from 4 to
   16 hours after that, even though percolate was still-occurring, Based on
   causative depth of recharge and amount of water level rise in wells, the
   specific yield of the aquifer was found to be of the order of 0.01. This
   value is characteristic of fracture geometry rather than matrix
   properties of the bedrock. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The area of north Evia and eastern central Greece is characterized by
   strong geomorphological contrast and is built up mainly of consolidated
   rocks. Unconsolidated young sediments of Pleistocene to Holocene age
   cover the valley and basin flats, forming the most productive aquifers
   in this area. However, two more types of aquifers can be distinguished
   within the consolidated rock,area. The first one is associated with
   karstified limestones and the second with strongly tectonized
   ultramafic-rocks. The schist-chert formation, with intercalations of
   shales and cherts, seals the ultramafic masses underneath.
   Surface and spring waters associated with ultramafic rocks in north Evia
   and eastern central Greece were studied. Two types of water can be
   distinguished: (1) high Mg2+ and SiO2, bicarbonate as the dominant
   anion, pH 7.4-9.2, temperature 9.5-16.3 degrees C, low TDS (total
   dissolved solutes) (459-1037 mg/l), found both in peridotite and
   serpentinite areas, classified as Mg-HCO3 type; (2) high Ca2+, low Mg2+
   and SiO2, hydroxyl ion as the major anion, pH 11.2, temperature 28
   degrees C, very low TDS (122 mg/l), found in peridotite areas,
   classified as Ca-OH type. The studied waters are highly supersaturated
   with respect to quartz, amorphous silica, brucite and most low
   temperature magnesium silicates (antigorite, sepiolite, talc, etc.).
   These waters show relatively narrow SiO2 concentration ranges and a
   trend parallel to the amorphous silica saturation surface. The silica
   supersaturated waters have the potential to precipitate silica and
   consequently could affect the people of the local communities that use
   it as drinking water, causing health problems (kidney stones). Copyright

Abstract = {{Microbiological degradation of perchloroethylene (PCE) under anaerobic
   conditions follows a series of chain reactions, in which, sequentially,
   trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-dichloroethylene (c-DCE), vinylchloride
   (VC) and ethene are generated. First-order degradation rate constants,
   partitioning coefficients and mass exchange rates for PCE, TCE, c-DCE
   and VC were compiled from the literature. The parameters were used in a
   case study of pump-and-treat remediation of a PCE-contaminated site near
   Tilburg, The Netherlands. Transport, non-equilibrium sorption and
   biodegradation chain processes at the site:were simulated using the
   CHAIN 2D code-without further calibration. The modelled PCE compared
   reasonably well with observed PCE concentrations in the pumped water. We
   also performed a scenario analysis by applying several increased
   reductive dechlorination rates, reflecting different degradation
   conditions (e.g, addition of yeast extract and citrate). The scenario
   analysis predicted considerably higher concentrations: of the
   degradation products as a result of enhanced reductive dechlorination of
   PCE. The predicted levels of the very toxic compound VC were now an
   order of magnitude above the maximum permissible concentration levels,

Abstract = {{An instantaneous unit sediment graph (IUSG) model in conjunction with
   Kalman filter was investigated for prediction of sediment yield from an
   upland watershed in Northwestern Mississippi. The state vector of the
   watershed sediment yield system was constituted by the IUSG and then the
   sediment yield was estimated by the IUSG model using Kalman filter. The
   initial values of the state:vector were assumed as the average of the
   IUSG values and the initial sediment yield estimated from the average
   IUSG. The IUSG model using Kalman filler with a recursive algorithm
   accurately predicted sediment yield from watershed W-5, Mississippi. The
   filter allowed the IUSG to vary in time, increased the accuracy of the
   IUSG model, and reduced physical uncertainty of the sediment yield
   process in the watershed. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Nationwide changes in spatially well-resolved patterns of British-runoff
   were investigated under two climate change scenarios derived from
   general circulation model(GCM) output. A physical process-based
   hydrological model (HYSIM) was used to simulate effective runoff across
   a 10 km x 10 km British grid under baseline and future climate
   conditions. A gridded baseline climatology for precipitation and the
   Penman variables was used to validate HYSIM across Britain using grid
   cell-specific parameters derived from land use and soil type. The
   climate change scenarios were constructed from the Hadley Centre's high
   resolution equilibrium GCM (UKHI) for 2050 and transient GCM (UKTR) for
   2065. Future effective:runoff was simulated under both scenarios by
   applying changes in precipitation and the Penman variables to the
   baseline climatology. Annual effective runoff is shown to increase
   throughout most of Britain under the UKHI scenario for 2050, whilst it
   decreases over much of England and Wales under the UKTR scenario for
   2065. Both scenarios show an increasing gradient in runoff between a
   wetter northern Britain and a drier south-eastern Britain, This gradient
   is more pronounced under the UKTR scenario. Changes in effective runoff
   for winter and summer show an increase in seasonality under both
   scenarios, Winter runoff is shown to increase most in northern Britain
   under both scenarios, whilst summer runoff is shown to experience major
   reductions over much of England and Wales under the UKTR scenario. If
   these simulations are realized, Britain may expect an accentuated north
   to south-east imbalance in available water resources. If this is
   combined with a temporal imbalance suggested by the increased
   seasonality, there could be problems for the future management of
   British water resources. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission losses through the beds of hillslope rills were studied at
   two sites in the semi-arid south-western United States. At one site the
   rills were sand-bedded and at-the other they were gravel-bedded.
   Transmission losses in the sand-bedded rills are about 66\% higher than
   those in the gravel-bedded rills. The former show evidence of increasing
   transmission loss with increasing depth of flow. whereas the latter do
   not. In both cases, transmission losses in the rills are about an order
   of magnitude greater than infiltration losses in adjacent interrill
   areas. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Every year the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers in Bangladesh transport 316
   and 721 million tonnes of sediment, respectively. These high loads of
   suspended sediment reflect the very high rate of denudation in their
   drainage basins. The average mechanical denudation rate for the Ganges
   and Brahmaputra basins together is 365 mm 103 yr(-1). However, the rate
   is higher in the Brahmaputra Basin than that in the Ganges Basin.
   Several factors, including mean trunk channel gradient, relief ratio,
   runoff, basin lithology and recurring earthquakes are responsible for
   these high denudation rates. Of the total suspended sediment load (i.e.
   1037 million tonnes) transported by these rivers, only 525 million
   tonnes (c. 51\% of the total load) are delivered to the coastal area of
   Bangladesh and the remaining 512 million tonnes are deposited within the
   lower basin, offsetting the subsidence. Of the deposited load, about 289
   million tonnes (about 28\% of the total load) are deposited on the
   floodplains of these rivers. The remaining 223 million tonnes (about
   21\% of the total load) are deposited within the river channels,
   resulting in aggradation of the channel bed at an average rate of about
   3.9 cm yr(-1) Although the Brahmaputra transports a higher sediment load
   than the Ganges, the channel bed aggradation rate is much higher for the
   Ganges. This study also documents a wide range of interannual, seasonal
   and daily variation in suspended sediment transport and water discharge.
   Interannual variation in sediment deposition within the basin is also
   suggested. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper highlights the use of a conceptual method for separating
   runoff components in daily hydrographs, Contrary to the traditionally
   used graphical method of separation. In,the conceptual method, the
   components, viz, surface flow, interflow and baseflow, are regarded as
   high,medium and low frequency signals and their separation is done using
   the principle of a recursive digital filter commonly used in signal
   analysis and processing. It requires estimates of the direct runoff
   (beta(d),) and surface runoff (beta(s)) filter parameters which are
   obtained by a least-squares procedure involving baseflow and interflow
   indices based on graphical and recursive digital filter estimation
   techniques. The method thus circumvents the subjective element
   associated with the graphical procedure of hydrograph separation, in
   which:case the eye approximation and/or one's skill at plotting is the
   prime basis for the whole analysis. The analysis based on three forest
   catchments in Kimakia, Kenya, East Africa, revealed that beta(d) = K-b
   and beta(s) = K-i, where K-b and K-i are the baseflow and interflow
   recession constants. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) is located in the northern extreme of
   Alberta, Canada and is one of the world's largest freshwater inland
   deltas. This complex and dynamic ecosystem has undergone substantial
   change over the last 25 years, primarily as a result of alterations to
   the hydrologic regime. The remoteness of the region, along with a
   shortage of hydrologic and ecological information, has necessitated the
   development of innovative methods, based on the use of satellite
   imagery, to assess these changes. Specialized image classification
   schemes were employed to derive a sixteen-year historical database of
   changes in water area on large lakes and isolated small basins within
   the delta. The time series for the large lakes has been used to quantify
   their hypsometric characteristics, information crucial to defining
   storage terms for hydraulic flow models of the delta, particularly at
   high stage conditions that involve over-bank flooding. Analysis of the
   perched basins has proven that, even with the relatively coarse
   resolution of LANDSAT images, satellite remote sensing of water
   conditions in the myriad of PAD riparian basins is a viable technique
   for hydrologic and ecological monitoring. The satellite derived
   time-series record of water levels on Jemis Lake has also permitted the
   first independent validation of the perched-basin water-balance model
   recently developed for use in assessing water-management options for the
   PAD. Recommendations for future research using RADARSAT are also noted.

Abstract = {{Data acquisition by Environment Canada and others over the last 20 years
   now allows the first comprehensive synthesis of the riverine sediment
   balance of the Mackenzie Delta. The data presented here are: sediment
   inputs from the Mackenzie and Peer rivers at the delta head and river
   sediment transfers from the Upper Delta to the Outer Delta (1974-1994);
   in-channel and overbank sedimentation, including lakes(post-1963); and
   in-channel erosion along Delta channels (1950-1981). These data indicate
   that the mean annual sediment input to the Delta is about 128 Mt, and
   the corresponding loss to offshore is about 85 Mt. The net sedimentation
   of 43 Mt is divided almost equally between the Upper Delta (mostly on
   levees and lake beds) and the Outer Delta (mostly on lake shores). Gross
   sedimentation within the Delta, about 50\% of which is on point bars, is
   much higher, estimated at about 103 Mt annually: the difference is the
   large amount of sediment reentrainment within the Delta, through bank
   erosion, primarily along Middle Channel. How much of this pointbar
   deposition is from settling of sediment delivered by the Mackenzie and
   Peel rivers (as distinct from local sediment derived from bank scour
   within the Delta) is not known. Such within-Delta sediment exchange
   (which could be as high as 50 Mt) might be important in determining the
   quality of sediment (nutrients, contaminants, etc) that it is being
   delivered offshore: it would be naive to assume that all of this
   sediment is from the present-day input of the Mackenzie and Peel rivers.

Abstract = {{Spatial variation in lake sedimentation within the Mackenzie Delta was
   documented, and total lake sedimentation over the past 30 years was
   estimated, by classifying (via aerial photography) the flooding
   characteristics of a complete transect of lakes (about 2600 lakes)
   across the upper subaerial delta plain, then selecting representative
   samples of lakes (81 lakes) from the transect, and a random sample of
   lakes from a second transect (7 lakes) across the lower subaerial plain,
   for direct measurement of sedimentation rates. The depth corresponding
   to the 1963 sediment layer was obtained from a sediment core from each
   of these lakes by sampling the core at frequent depth intervals to
   identify the peak in Cs-137 (Caesium-137) content. Lake sediment bulk
   densities, as obtained from the cores, averaged 931 kg/m(3), a value
   lower than reported in previous studies. Using mean bulk density above
   each Cs-137 peak, and the depth of the Cs-137 peak, mean lake
   sedimentation for different lake types varied between 1.19 kg/m(2)/yr
   and 5.34 kg/m(2)/yr, with a decrease in sedimentation as lake sill
   elevation increased. Values for the lower delta transect averaged 1.36
   kg/m(2)/yr. By combining relationships between sedimentation and lake
   type with a classification of lake types, total sedimentation across the
   upper-delta transect is estimated as 8.2 Mt/yr, and 0.8 Mt/yr for the
   lower delta. These values are lower than previously reported primarily
   because they are derived from lower bulk density values. Of the total
   upper-delta sedimentation, 17\% occurs in high-closure lakes, 53\% in
   low-closure lakes, and 30\% in no-closure lakes. Lake sedimentation is
   higher in the Middle Channel segment of the upper-delta transect (44\%
   of total sedimentation across the transect) than in the East Channel
   (25\%) or Peel Channel (32\%) segments. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Two subarctic forested slopes in central Wolf Creek basin, Yukon, were
   studied in 1996-1997 to determine the seasonal pattern of the hydrologic
   processes. A south-facing slope has a dense aspen forest on silty soils
   with seasonal frost only and a north-facing slope has open stands of
   black spruce and an organic layer on top of clay sediments with
   permafrost. Snowmelt is advanced by approximately one month on the
   south-facing slope due to greater radiation receipt. Meltwater
   infiltrates its seasonally frozen soil with low ice content, recharging
   the soil moisture reservoir but yielding no lateral surface or
   subsurface how. Summer evaporation depletes this recharged moisture and
   any additional rainfall input, at the expense of surface or subsurface
   flow. The north-facing slope with an ice rich substrate hinders deep
   percolation. Snow meltwater is impounded within the organic layer to
   produce surface runoff in rills and gullies, and subsurface flow along
   pipes and within the matrix of the organic soil. During the summer, most
   subsurface flows are confined to the organic layer which has hydraulic
   conductivities orders of magnitudes larger than the underlying
   boulder-clay. Evaporation on the north-facing slope declines as both the
   frost table and the water table descend in the summer. A water balance
   of the two slopes demonstrates that vertical processes of infiltration
   and evaporation dominate moisture exchanges on the south-facing slope,
   whereas the retardation of deep drainage by frost and by clayey soil on
   the permafrost slope promotes a strong lateral flow component,
   principally within the organic layer. These results have the important
   implication that permafrost slopes and organic horizons are the
   principal controls on streamflow generation in subarctic catchments.

Abstract = {{Hillslope runoff processes were studied in the tundra region of the
   Canadian western arctic in order to provide a physically-based,
   conceptual framework for runoff generation for basins in this
   environment. It was found that subsurface flow is the dominant mechanism
   of runoff to the stream channel, that this flow is conveyed
   predominantly through the peat of the inter-hummock channels, and that
   subsurface flow through the highly conductive upper peat layer and soil
   pipes can be as rapid as surface flow. Stream discharge was computed
   from computations of hillslope runoff and meltwater input from the
   snowpack in the stream channel. The similarity between the computed and
   measured stream discharge suggests that the approach used to compute
   discharge would be useful as a conceptual basis for a distributed
   hydrological model for this environment. Hydrological interaction among
   the basin subsystems was found to play an important role in runoff
   generation. For example, when the water table was in the highly
   conductive upper peat layer, and discharge from inter-hummock channels
   was relatively large (similar to 0.1-1.0 m(3) d(-1)), the near-stream
   area, a zone of relatively thick peat, offered little attenuation to
   water draining toward the stream channel, and the source area for stream
   flow was relatively large. The duration of this high flow regime Varied
   among hillsides due to variations in the width of the near-stream area,
   the gradient, length and inclination of hillslopes, and the water
   equivalent and melt rate of the snowpack. When the water table subsided
   into the lower peat layer, and discharge from inter-hummock channels
   decreased (<0.1 m(3) d(-1)), the runoff source area was relatively
   small. Under this condition, if drainage into the near-stream area
   increased, the lateral expansion of the runoff source area would be
   delayed due to the relatively large storage capacity near the stream.

Abstract = {{Bedload roughness is the roughness produced by sediment transported near
   the bed. While it is well established that the magnitude of this
   roughness is proportional to the thickness of the moving sediment layer,
   the effect of sediment concentration remains largely unknown. This paper
   presents the results of a flume experiment that was designed to
   investigate the effect of sediment concentration on bedload roughness.
   The experiment consisted of creating flow conditions where bedload
   transport is supply-limited and injecting gravel size particles (D-50 =
   7.4 mm) at the upstream end of the flume in order to produce bedload
   transport. While keeping flow conditions constant, sediment
   concentration was varied by successively increasing the injection rate
   of gravel in the flow. For each injection rate, flow velocity profiles
   were measured in order to evaluate changes of mean flow velocity U,
   shear velocity u{*}, roughness length z(o) and resistance to flow f. The
   results indicate that low sediment concentration affects mainly the near
   bed portion of the flow where it causes a reduction of mean flow
   velocity and an increase of shear velocity and roughness length. For
   larger sediment concentration, the whole how velocity profile becomes
   affected by bedload roughness but the importance of this effect always
   remain larger near the bed. As sediment concentration is augmented, mean
   flow velocity is consistently reduced but shear velocity and roughness
   length increase until a plateau is reached where these two variables
   become constant. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Importance of shrinkage and compression in determining water storage
   changes in peat: the case of a mined peatland}},

Abstract = {{This study examines changes in peat volume in a mined peatland near Lac
   St Jean, Quebec, during the spring and summer of 1995 and 1996, and the
   implication for water storage changes. Lowering of the water table
   caused drainage above the water table, but the specific yield (S-y) of
   the peat was relatively small (0.48), and did not adequately describe
   the water storage change. Lowering of the water table also caused
   surface subsidence, which was shown to be partly due to shrinkage above
   the water table (<3.6 cm), and partly due to compression of the
   saturated peat (about 6 cm). Measured total surface subsidence ranged
   from 6.5 to 10 cm. The change in pear volume occurred over the entire
   depth of the peat deposit (b), and so the storativity due to peat
   compression (bS(s)), estimated to be 0.13, was more important than
   specific yield in determining water storage changes. Total storativity
   (S-tot) was best estimated as the sum S-y + bS(s).
   Changes in peat volume in the 0-3 cm layer were evident in the
   temporally variable bulk density (83-101 kg m(-3)). Its relationship
   with Volumetric moisture content was highly hysteretic, reflecting the
   complexity of the process in the unsaturated zone. However, there was a
   linear relationship with water tension, suggesting a more direct causal
   relationship. Changes in pest volume were also recorded below the water
   table, as the volumetric water content of the saturated peat decreased
   by 3.5\% over the season. Since this applied to a relatively thick layer
   of peat, its total effect was greater than shrinkage in the zone above
   the water table. It was concluded that most peatland water balances
   should make account of storage changes associated with peat Volume
   changes, and that peat volume changes may increase the water limitations
   to plants when the water table drops below the surface. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{This paper advances an objective method of diurnal hydrograph
   classification as an aid to exploring changes in the hydrological
   functioning of glacierized catchments over the ablation season. The
   temporal sequencing of different hydrograph classes allows
   identification of seasonal evolution in hydrograph form and also assists
   delimitation of hydrologically-meaningful time periods of similar
   diurnal discharge response. The effectiveness of this approach is
   illustrated by applying it to two contrasting summer discharge records
   for a small cirque basin. By comparing the results with patterns of
   surface energy receipt and glacier ablation, the seasonally transient
   relative influences of: (i) surface meltwater production and (ii)
   meltwater routing and storage conditions within the intervening glacier
   drainage system in determining runoff are elucidated. The method
   successfully characterizes distinct seasonal-scale changes in the
   diurnal outflow hydrograph during the ablation-dominated 1995 melt
   season but is also able to reveal underlying trends and short-term
   fluctuations in the precipitation-dominated, poorly ablation-regulated
   1996 melt season. The limitations and benefits of this hydrograph
   classification technique are evaluated. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The rivers of western Costa Pica are prone to considerable interannual
   variability in flooding, which in the most severe years can lead to loss
   of life, property and national infra-structure. Flood generating
   processes an exclusively rainfall driven, but are complex in both their
   spatial and temporal distribution due to the variety of oceanic and
   continental influences which impinge on the region, and to the various
   natures and timings of their responses to the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. Annual floods and partial duration series
   derived from daily discharge records from four basins within the Pacific
   watershed are analysed using a series of standard probability
   distributions and parameters estimated by means of L-moments, The
   observed temporal and spatial patterns of flood events are consistent
   with the documented meteorological processes and also exhibit marked
   changes in behaviour between the two extreme phases of the ENSO
   phenomenon. Particularly noticeable in this regard are; the variable
   length of the short dry season, the veranillos, which is related to the
   strength of the northeast trades, and interrupts the rainy season; the
   number of floods in the period immediately following the the veranillos,
   which is positively associated with the number of tropical storms in the
   Caribbean basin; and the number of cold fronts emanating from North
   America during the boreal winter. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{During the last 20 years considerable progress has been made in our
   understanding of the physical processes controlling snowcover formation
   and melt. This work provides the basis required for a better
   understanding of, and ability to predict, the complex role snow plays in
   alpine and northern environments, including, for example, streamflow,
   climate, fluxes of nutrients and pollutants through the snow pack, and
   subnivean ecology. This paper provides a brief synthesis of the current
   state of our understanding and critical areas for future research on
   processes controlling snowcover distribution, melt and runoff. A major
   focus is to review progress to dale on the importance of the
   heterogeneous nature of the snowcover over a wide range of scales.

Abstract = {{The general role of snow in the ecology of snow-covered systems is
   presented. A brief review on the interactions between snow and climate,
   and between snow and microorganisms, vegetation and animals is followed
   by a discussion on some of the processes which mediate nutrient cycling
   when snow lies on the ground. The influence of snow on nutrient cycling
   and its importance in the overall biological productivity of
   snow-covered ecosystems is illustrated by the study of the dynamics of
   nitrogen (N). The topics include the assimilation of N by algae within
   snow cover, the gaseous emissions of CO2 and N2O from soil under snow
   cover and the hydrologic export of N during snowmelt. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The concept of scale can be used to quantify characteristic lengths of
   (a) a natural process (such as the correlation length of the spatial
   snow water equivalent (SWE) variability); (b) a measurement (such as the
   size of a snow density sample or the footprint of a satellite sensor),
   and (c) a model (such as the grid size of a distributed snow model). The
   different types of scales are denoted as process scale, measurement
   scale and model scale, respectively. Interpolations, extrapolations,
   aggregations, and disaggregations are viewed as a change in model scale
   and/or measurement scale.
   In a first step we examine, in a linear stochastic analysis, the effect
   of measurement scale and model scale on the data and the model
   predictions. It is shown that the ratio of the measurement scale and the
   process scale, and the ratio of the model scale and the process scale
   are the driving parameters for the scale effects. These scale effects
   generally cause biases in the variances and spatial correlation lengths
   of satellite images, field measurements, and simulation results of snow
   models. It is shown, by example, how these biases can be identified and
   corrected by regularization methods. At the core of these analyses is
   the variogram. For the case of snow cover patterns, it is shown that it
   may be difficult to infer the true snow cover variability from the
   variograms, particularly when they span many orders of magnitude.
   In a second step we examine distributed snow models which are a
   non-linear deterministic approach to changing the scale. Unlike in the
   linear case, in these models a change of scale may also bias the mean
   over a catchment of snow-related variables such as SWE. There are a
   number of fundamental scaling issues with distributed models which
   include subgrid variability, the question of an optimum element size,
   and parameter identifiability. We give methods for estimating subgrid
   variability. We suggest that, in general, an optimum element size may
   not exist and that the model element scale may in practice be dictated
   by data availability and the required resolution of the predictions. The
   scale effects in distributed non-linear models can be related to the
   linear stochastic case which allows us to generalize the applicability
   of regularization methods. While most of the paper focuses on physical
   snow processes, similar conclusions apply and similar methods are
   applicable to chemical and biological processes. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Hen we provide an overview of current research activities on nitrogen
   (N) cycling in high-elevation catchments of the Colorado Front Range. We
   then use this information to develop a conceptual model of how snow
   cover controls subnivial (below snowpack) microbial processes and N
   leachate from the snow-soil interface to surface waters. This model is
   based on research that identifies subnivial processes as a major control
   on the leaching loss of N from soil during snowmelt. These subnivial
   soil processes are controlled by the development of the seasonal snow
   pack that insulates soil from cold air temperatures and allows
   heterotrophic microbial activity in the soil to immobilize N. In this
   model the duration of snow-cover is divided into four snowpack regimes
   zone I is characterized by shallow-short duration snowpacks, zone II is
   characterized by high interannual variability in snow depth and
   duration, zone III is characterized by early developing, continuous snow
   cover, and zone IV is characterized by deep, long-duration snow cover
   verging on perennial snowpacks. In zone I, soils remain frozen and there
   is little microbial activity and N leachate is high. In zone II, total
   microbial activity is highly variable and the amount of N leachate is
   highly variable. In zone III, total microbial activity is high and there
   is little N leachate. In zone IV, microbial activity is reduced because
   of carbon limitation and N leachate is high. This model suggests that a
   portion of the spatial and temporal variability observed in N export
   from these seasonally snow-covered systems is due to variability in
   winter snow cover across landscape types and inter-annually within a
   landscape type. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The causes of natural variability in catchment scale N export need to be
   understood and quantified before the effects of increased N deposition
   in high elevation catchments can be evaluated. This study evaluates
   controls on the size of the leachable soil N pool concurrent with the
   spring hydrologic flush that is primarily responsible for the transport
   of N to surface water. In high elevation catchments in the western
   United States, sources of N during this snowmelt flush include both
   atmospheric N deposition stored in the snowpack until melt and mobile
   soil N pools, and sinks are dominated by biogeochemical processes that
   occur in soil under snow cover. Because soil processes may serve either
   as a source or sink for N, controls on the amount of inorganic N leached
   from soil during the snowmelt period were evaluated in the major
   landscape types in four catchments in Colorado. Measurements of leached
   N were inversely related to measurements of over-winter CO2 flux at all
   sites, indicating that N was immobilized in soil heterotrophic biomass.
   Because over-winter soil heterotrophic activity is controlled primarily
   by the depth and timing of snow accumulation, the importance of these
   plot scale measurements to catchment scale N export were evaluated using
   a long-term record of winter precipitation, N deposition, and N export
   from Loch Vale in Rocky Mountain National Park. This data set identified
   a strong, linear relationship (r(2) = 0.68) between catchment scale N
   retention and winter snow cover, consistent with subnivean, soil based
   controls on the mobile N pool identified at the plot scale. These
   results indicate that the winter snow pack is the major control both on
   hydrologic N export and on soil source/sink relationships for N
   concurrent with this transport mechanism. The effect of winter snow
   cover on the fate of both atmospheric and soil N needs to be considered
   when evaluating potential the effects of increased N deposition on
   either terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems in seasonally snow-covered
   watersheds. In these systems, changes in surface water chemistry are
   likely to occur in high deposition, snow-covered sites during low snow
   years before terrestrial vegetation is affected. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Snowpack, soil, soil leachate, and streamwater samples were analyzed for
   inorganic nitrogen (N) to quantify the net effect of soil processes on N
   export during spring snowmelt. The two catchments used for this work,
   Snake River and Deer Creek, are located in Summit County, Colorado and
   range in elevation from 3350 to 4120 m. Atmospheric N loading to the
   snowpack, 88 mg N m(-2) (=0.88 kg N ha(-1)), was representative of low N
   deposition sites in the Rocky Mountains. Potentially mobile inorganic N
   in soil, 1252 to 1868 mg N m(-2), was much greater than N inputs from
   snow. During spring snowmelt, nitrate (NO3-) leachate from alpine soil,
   702 mg N m(-2), was significantly greater than from sub-alpine forest
   and meadow soils (p < 0.001). This pattern in soil leachate was
   consistent with streamwater N concentrations in Deer Creek, indicating
   the importance of soil processes in regulating N export from these high
   elevation catchments. Soils may function as sources or sinks of N during
   spring snowmelt; alpine soils were a significant source of N to the
   stream, while sub-alpine soils were possible N sinks. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{We have studied weekly precipitation, snowpack, snowmelt, soil water and
   streamwater chemistry throughout winter for over a decade in a small
   (176 ha) northern Michigan watershed with high snowfall and vegetated by
   60 to 80 year-old northern hardwoods. In this paper, we examine
   physical, chemical, and biological processes responsible for observed
   seasonal change in streamwater chemistry based upon intensive study
   during winter 1996-1997. The objective was to define the contributions
   made to winter and spring streamwater chemical concentration and flux by
   processes as snowmelt, over-winter forest floor and surface soil
   mineralization, immobilization, and exchange, and subsurface flowpath.
   The forest floor and soils were unfrozen beneath the snowpack which
   permitted most snowmelt to enter. Over-winter soil mineralization and
   other biological processes maintain shallow subsurface ion and dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) reservoirs. Small, but steady, snowmelt throughout
   winter removed readily mobilized soil NO3- which resulted in high
   over-winter streamwater concentrations but little flux. Winter soil
   water levels and flowpaths were generally deep which increased soil
   water and streamwater base cation (C-B), HCO3-, and Si concentrations.
   Spring snowmelt increased soil water levels and removal of ions and DOC
   from the biologically active forest floor and shallow soils. The
   snowpack solute content was a minor component in determining streamwater
   ion concentration or flux during and following peak snowmelt.
   Exchangeable ions, weakly adsorbed anions, and DOC in the forest floor
   and surface soils dominated the chemical concentration and flux in soil
   water and streamwater. Following peak snowmelt, soil microbial
   immobilization and rapidly increased plant uptake of limiting nutrients
   removed nearly all available nitrogen from soil water and streamwater.
   During the growing season high evapotranspiration increased subsurface
   flowpath depth which in turn removed weathering products, especially
   C-B, HCO3-, and Si, from deeper soils. Soil water was a major component
   in the hydrologic and chemical budgets. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Sensitivity analysis for hydrochemical models requires consideration of
   the multivariate nature of watershed response. A robust multiobjective
   generalized sensitivity analysis (MOGSA) procedure, recently developed
   at the University of Arizona, was used to fully investigate the single
   objective parameter sensitivity of the Alpine Hydrochemical Model (AHM).
   A total of 20000 simulations for a two-year period were conducted for
   the Emerald Lake watershed in Sequoia National Park, California. For
   each simulation 21 objective functions were evaluated: they were
   discharge and both concentration and mass flux for ten chemical species.
   The MOGSA procedure revealed that only 2000 simulations were necessary
   to establish the parameters sensitive to mass flux or concentration. We
   found significant differences in parameter sensitivity for concentration
   versus mass flux objective functions. For example, a snowpack elution
   parameter and a number of hydrologic parameters were sensitive for Cl-
   concentration, while only the snowpack elution parameter was sensitive
   for Cl- mass flux. By using mass flux instead of concentration fewer
   mineral weathering parameters and more soil exchange parameters were
   sensitive. Mass flux calculations emphasize the spring snowmelt and peak
   discharge events of the early summer. Our results indicate that using
   mass instead of concentration permits better identification of the model
   parameters that most affect stream conditions during peak springtime
   flows and that some combination of mass flux and concentration
   objectives should be used in evaluating model performance. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Recent advances in the understanding of the interactions between
   non-polar organic chemicals and frozen water have revealed the immense
   importance of the ice-air interface and the possibility of
   quantitatively treating the adsorption process on the ice surface in
   terms of chemical-specific interfacial partition coefficients and the
   snow specific surface area. A simple fugacity-based chemical fate model
   is used to describe quantitatively the behaviour of selected non-polar
   organic contaminants during snowpack melting, namely atmosphere-snow
   exchange, redistribution within the snowpack and draining with
   meltwater, The simulations are evaluated using field data on snowpack
   and meltwater concentrations of these chemicals measured in a small
   watershed in the Canadian Arctic during the melting period of 1993. The
   model reproduced the observed preferential elution of
   hexachlorocyclohexanes in the first meltwater fractions, and the
   relative retention of polychlorinated biphenyls within the snowpack. The
   model calculations indicate that the specific surface area of the ice
   crystals and the air-ice and air-water partition coefficients of the
   chemical are key parameters controlling the extent and timing of
   chemical loss with the meltwater. For particle-sorptive substances, the
   fate of particles during snowmelt must also be considered. Uncertainty
   in describing interfacial partitioning and the behaviour of particles
   during melting presently limits the capabilities of models to simulate
   and ultimately predict meltwater concentrations of non-polar organic
   contaminants. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   aerosol concentrations prevailed. At Inuvik, concentrations of SO42- and
   Cl- were five to six times higher in intercepted snow than in surface
   snow away from the trees. SO4-S and Cl loads at Inuvik were
   correspondingly enhanced three-fold within the nearest 0.5 m to
   individual tree stems. Measurements of snow affected by canopy
   interception without rapid sublimation provided no evidence of ion
   volatilization from intercepted snow. Where intercepted snow sublimation
   rates were significant, ion loads in sub-canopy snow suggested that NO3-
   volatized with an efficiency of about 62\% per snow mass sublimated.
   Extrapolating this measurement from Waskesiu to sublimation losses
   observed in other southern boreal environments suggests that 19-25\% of
   snow inputs of NO3- can be lost during intercepted snow sublimation. The
   amount of N lost during sublimation may be large in high-snowfall, high
   N load southern boreal forests (Quebec) where 0.42 kg NO3-N ha(-1) is
   estimated as a possible seasonal NO3- volatilization. The sensitivity of
   the N fluxes to climate and forest canopy variation and implications of
   the winter N losses for N budgets in the boreal forest are discussed.

Abstract = {{We have initiated a long-term experiment to examine the consequences of
   decreases in snowpack accumulation at the Hubbard Brook Experimental
   Forest (HBEF), a northern hardwood dominated forest located in the White
   Mountains of New Hampshire. We are quantifying the effects of decreases
   in snowpack accumulation on root dynamics of two key tree species in
   this forest (sugar maple, yellow birch), microbial biomass and activity,
   NO3- and cation loss, the acid-base chemistry of drainage water, and
   soil-atmosphere trace gas fluxes. We are calibrating an existing model
   (SNTHERM) to depict snow depth and soil frost dynamics given past or
   future climate scenarios for our site. In this paper, we describe the
   methods we are using for the manipulation studies that began in the
   winter of 1997/1998 and present preliminary results from our first full
   year of treatment. Results from our methods development efforts show
   that it is possible to keep plots snow free by shovelling without
   disturbing the forest floor. Preliminary test plot work showed that the
   SNTHERM model is capable of depicting snow depth and soil temperatures
   in both control and manipulated plots at our site. Results from our
   first full year of treatment showed that a relatively mild freezing
   event induced significant increases in nitrogen (N) mineralization and
   nitrification rates, solute leaching and soil nitrous oxide production
   and caused significant decreases in soil methane uptake. These results
   suggest that soil freezing events may be major regulators of soil
   biogeochemical processes and solute delivery to streams in forested
   watersheds. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Research on the effects of vegetation manipulation on snowpack, soil
   water, and streamwater chemistry and flux has been underway at the
   Fraser Experimental Forest (FEF), CO, since 1982. Greater than 95\% of
   FEF snowmelt passes through watersheds as subsurface flow where soil
   processes significantly alter meltwater chemistry. To better understand
   the mechanisms accounting for annual variation in watershed streamwater
   ion concentration and flux with snowmelt, we studied subsurface water
   flow, its ion concentration, and flux in conterminous forested and clear
   cut plots. Repetitive patterns in subsurface flow and chemistry were
   apparent. Control plot subsurface flow chemistry had the highest ion
   concentrations in late winter and fall. When shallow subsurface flow
   occurred, its Ca2+, SO42-, and HCO3- concentrations were lower and K+
   higher than deep flow. The percentage of Ca2+, NO3-, SO42-, and HCO3-
   flux in shallow depths was less and K+ slightly greater than the
   percentage of total flow. Canopy removal increased precipitation
   reaching the forest floor by about 40\%, increased peak snowpack water
   equivalent (SWE) > 35\%, increased the average snowpack Ca2+, NO3- and
   NH4+ content, reduced the snowpack K+ content, and increased the runoff
   four-fold. Clear cutting doubled the percentage of subsurface flow at
   shallow depths, and increased K+ concentration in shallow subsurface
   flow and NO3- concentrations in both shallow and deep flow. The
   percentage change in total Ca2+, SO42-, and HCO3- flux in shallow depths
   was less than the change in water flux, while that of K+ and NO3- flux
   was greater. Relative to the control, in the clear cut the percentage of
   total Ca2+ flux at shallow depths increased from 5 to 12\%, SO42- 5.4 to
   12\%, HCO3- from 5.6 to 8.7\%, K+ from 6 to 35\%, and NO3- from 2.7 to
   17\%. The increases in Ca2+ and SO42- flux were proportional to the
   increase in water flux, the flux of HCO3- increased proportionally less
   than water flux, and NO3- and K+ were proportionally greater than water
   flux. Increased subsurface flow accounted for most of the increase in
   non-limiting nutrient loss. For limiting nutrients, loss of plant uptake
   and increased shallow subsurface flow accounted for the greater loss.
   Seasonal ion concentration patterns in streamwater and subsurface flow
   were similar. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We measured the carbon discharge from a small, forested watershed that
   is covered with deep snow in winter. Snowmelt and rainfall both cause
   high flows, and we compared their effect on carbon discharge
   characteristics. The particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration was
   stable (around 5 mgC/l) at times of low flow and increased rapidly
   during high flow periods. The maximum POC concentration exceeded 80
   mgC/l during rainfall, but it did not exceed 20 mgC/l during snowmelt,
   even though the rate of water discharge was high for both events. The
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC)
   concentrations fluctuated seasonally, and also temporarily during high
   flow events. The DIC concentration decreased from 4.0 to 1.4 mgC/l as
   the spring thaw progressed. It increased progressively to a high of 7
   mg/l in August and September, and then gradually decreased again. The
   DOC increased rapidly from 2 to 4 mg/l at the beginning of the thaw,
   then plunged to 2 mg/l when the snowpack disappeared. It increased from
   July until October (>5 mgC/l) and then decreased once more. The DOC and
   DIC concentrations were not clearly synchronized during the snowmelt,
   During rainfall, the DIC concentration decreased in rising limbs of the
   hydrograph and increased in falling limbs, whereas the reverse was the
   case for the DOC concentration. In late November, however, both the DOC

Abstract = {{Three 60 m long, 2.8 m high snowfences have been erected to study long
   term effects of changing winter snow conditions on arctic and alpine
   tundra. This paper describes the experimental design and short-term
   effects. Open-top fiberglass warming chambers are placed along the
   experimental snow gradients and in controls areas outside the fences;
   each warming plot is paired with an unwarmed plot. The purpose of the
   experiment is to examine short- and long-term changes to the integrated
   physical-biological systems under simultaneous changes of winter snow
   regime and summer temperature, as part of the Long-Term Ecological
   Research network and the International Tundra Experiment. The sites were
   at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, a temperate high altitude site in the Colorado
   Rockies, and Toolik Lake, Alaska, a high-latitude site. Initial results
   indicate that although experimental designs are essentially identical at
   the arctic and alpine sites, experimental effects are different. The
   drift at Niwot Ridge lasts much longer than do the Toolik Lake drifts,
   so that the Niwot Ridge fence affects both summer and winter conditions,
   whereas the Toolik Lake fence affects primarily winter conditions. The
   temperature experiment also differs in effect between the sites.
   Although the average temperature increase at the two sites is similar
   (daily increase 1.5 degrees C at Toolik and 1.9 degrees C at Niwot
   Ridge), at Toolik Lake there is only minor diurnal variation, whereas at
   Niwot Ridge the daytime increases an extreme on sunny days (as much as
   7-10 degrees C), and minimum nighttime temperatures in the chambers are
   often slightly cooler than ambient (by about 1 degrees C), The
   experimental drifts resulted in wintertime increases in temperature and
   CO2 flux. Temperatures under the deep drifts were much more consistent
   and warmer than in control areas, and at Niwot Ridge remained very close
   to 0 degrees C all winter. These increased temperatures were likely
   responsible for observed increases in system carbon loss. Initial
   changes to the aboveground biotic system included an increase in growth
   in response to both snow and warming, despite a reduced growing season.
   This is expected to be a transient response that will eventually be
   replaced by reduced growth. At least one species, Kobresia myosuroides,
   had almost completely died at Niwot Ridge three years after fence
   construction, whereas other species were increasing. We expect in both
   the short- and long-term to see the strongest effects of snow at the
   Niwot Ridge site, and stronger effects of temperature at Toolik Lake.

Abstract = {{Snow thickness. duration of snow coverage and amount of ice covering the
   soil are crucial for the development of biota in the Arctic tundra
   environment. The snow thickness and optical properties control the
   amount of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) that is available
   for vegetation. A late snow cover may prevent birds from nesting on the
   ground. Furthermore, ice at the snow/soil interface can be an obstacle
   for grazing of Svalbard reindeer and affect the microfauna population.
   Snow and ice thickness, and the physical and optical properties of snow
   covering Arctic tundra were measured on the Broggerhalvoya peninsula on
   western Svalbard in spring of 1997, Additionally, thicknesses of
   ground-covering ice were measured in spring of 1998. The initial maximum
   thickness of snow in the observed areas varied from 0.4 to 0.9 m. The
   snow around Ny-Alesund began to disappear by the beginning of June, with
   the entire snow pack disappearing within 2-3 weeks. At the bottom of the
   snow pack, there was a soil-covering ice layer between 0.05 and 0.1 m
   thick. We obtained radiation and reflectance parameters (spectral
   albedo, attenuation of PAR and global radiation) as well as physical
   properties of snow (e.g. temperature and density) over six weeks from
   early May to late June. Electrolytic conductivity of melted snow samples
   from snow pits shows clearly different conductivity for different
   stratigraphic sections within the snow pack in early June. Later on,
   these contrasts disappeared as internal ice layers melted and the snow
   pack underwent percolation. The albedo maximum before melt onset
   exceeded 0.9, whereas in the later phase of melting snow surfaces
   exhibited significantly lower albedo due to metamorphosis, thinning, and
   blackening by soil-particle contamination. However, even an apparently
   `clean' snow surface had about 30\% lower albedo in mid-June than in
   mid-May. Observations from under-snow PAR measurements are verified
   using a physically based radiative transfer model. This comparison
   indicates that scattering features that an smaller than the bulk-grain
   size may contribute significantly to the interaction between radiation
   and snowpack. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Snow accumulation on trees plays a major role for the snow cover
   structure in snow hydrology, and in avalanche protection of boreal and
   subalpine forests. In order to better understand the processes
   associated with this, we investigated snow accumulation on boards of
   different sizes, shapes, and inclination. For this purpose we exposed
   different boards to natural and man-made snowfalls. After each snowfall,
   we measured the accumulated snow mass on the boards as well as different
   snow characteristics and meteorological conditions.
   The observed snow interception efficiency increased with board width for
   snowfalls at mean air temperatures below -3 degrees C. This is explained
   by the decreasing rebound of the snow crystals near the edges. At
   temperatures above -3 degrees C the snow interception efficiency was
   independent from board width because of strong wet-snow cohesion. For
   wet snowfalls bridging occurred even at distances of 10 cm between
   boards. The inclination and the shapes of the boards had a significant
   influence on the amount of accumulated snow. Based on the measured
   accumulation and meteorological data, we derived statistical models for
   the accumulation of snow on boards. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Snow interception plays an important role in the hydrological cycle of
   mountain forests since it determines water supply for discharge in
   spring. A common way to measure the intercepted snow mass on trees is to
   put a cut tree on a scale. This method yields accurate results with a
   high temporal resolution but it destroys the natural system of tree,
   snowpack and soil. Hence, it does not work when water transport
   processes between the tree, the snowpack and the soil are investigated.
   We developed a non-destructive method to continuously observe and
   measure snow load on spruce branches during winter.
   Throughout a winter season we continuously observed a spruce with a
   video camera. To quantify the motion of branches during the snow
   interception process we suspended small illuminated balls on branches at
   different distances from the trunk. The position of the balls at a given
   time were measured by analysis of the video image. The result of this
   analysis is a time series of blanch motion during an interception event.
   Given the measured deflections the intercepted mass on branches was
   calculated. The deformation of branches under certain branch
   temperatures was calibrated with known weights. The calibrations were
   used to calculate the linear relation between the branch temperature and
   the Young's modulus of a branch. This relation was used as input into a
   finite element model which calculated the intercepted mass. For a fully
   snowcapped 220 cm long spruce branch we found an intercepted snow mass
   of 4.7 kg. The calculated snow mass was compared with snow storage
   measurements of different branches and showed that this method allows
   estimation of snow mass intercepted by a single branch. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{To evaluate an interactive effect of snow on energy exchange between the
   forest and atmosphere, the energy balance above a forest was measured
   continuously between February and April of 1997 in the Hitsujigaoka
   Experimental Forest, Sapporo, northern Japan. The forest was a dense,
   23-year-old, coniferous plantation. The study site had frequent
   snowfalls and the canopy was frequently covered with snow during the
   study period. Snow-cover on the canopy was monitored daily using a
   photo-camera mounted above the canopy, and the fraction of the
   snow-covered area on the canopy was determined as an index of the
   canopy-snow condition. Turbulent energy fluxes above the canopy were
   measured using the eddy and band-pass covariance method. The diurnal
   courses of the measurements showed that turbulent fluxes were sensitive
   to the snow on the canopy. Latent heat fluxes dominated above the
   snow-covered canopy and sensible heat flux prevailed above the snow-free
   canopy. The effect of the canopy-snow on turbulent energy exchange was
   examined using the evaporative efficiency for the canopy-layer in an
   energy balance model composed of two sources of vapor fluxes. The
   evaporative efficiency changed dynamically according to the canopy-snow
   condition in the short terms and could be positively related to the
   extension of the snow-covered area on the canopy. A quantitative
   relationship was empirically determined between the evaporative
   efficiency and the fraction of the canopy-snow area. The snowcover
   season in the study site can be classified into the following two types
   of turbulent flux composition: (1) in mid-winter, when the canopy was
   snow-covered, latent heat flux dominated and the Bowen ratio was
   positive and low; (2) during the snowmelt season, sensible heat flux
   from the dry canopy prevailed and the Bowen ratio was much larger than
   in mid-winter. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Heat and water exchange in forest areas constitutes one of the most
   important hydro-meteorological systems. In this study, the energy
   balances above three forests were measured during winter. Two were
   evergreen conifer forests and the third was a leafless deciduous forest.
   From this study, we gained the following new insights: there were no
   significant differences between the magnitudes of the net all-wave
   radiation and sensible heat, and the ratio of sensible heat to net
   all-wave radiation between the three experimental forests, despite the
   marked differences in canopy conditions. The net short-wave radiation
   was larger above the evergreen forests than above the deciduous forest,
   because of the low albedo above the evergreen forest. The converse was
   true, however, for net long-wave radiation, especially in the daytime.
   This was due to the difference in the upward long-wave radiation,
   because the deciduous forest canopy was quite sparse and some of the
   long-wave radiation emitted from the snow surface reached the atmosphere
   through the canopy. There was no clear difference in the net all-wave
   radiation above the two types of canopy. Canopy conditions caused major
   differences in roughness length and zero plane displacement. In the
   deciduous forest, the zero plane displacement was small and the
   roughness length was large, while in the evergreen forest the opposite
   was true. In the deciduous forest, the area in contact with the
   atmosphere increased because of the low position of the `active
   surface', and the roughness length was also high. Consequently, the
   sensible heat from the deciduous forest did not differ from that of the
   evergreen forests. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare two energy balance models to
   simulate energy exchange, skin temperature and albedo at the snow
   surface. Point measurements of vertical snow temperature and density
   profiles, snow surface temperature, net radiation and albedo were taken
   during spring 1997 at a site within a sparse coniferous stand in
   northern Finland. Standard meteorological measurements were available
   near the snow site at the Sodankyla Meteorological Observatory. The
   study period included two weeks of measurements of turbulent heat fluxes
   with the eddy-correlation method above snow as a part of the
   NOPEX-WINTEX project ``Land-surface-atmosphere interactions in a
   wintertime boreal landscape{''}. Two point models with different snow
   process representations were tested and the modelled energy fluxes at
   the snow surface were compared. UEB was chosen as a simple model, which
   derived the surface energy fluxes but treated the snowpack as one layer.
   SNTHERM represented a sophisticated model to simulate mass and energy
   transfer at the snowpack boundaries and within the snow cover. The
   results showed major differences in the modelled radiation balance due
   to different albedo procedures implemented in the models. The model
   comparison using identical radiation input data indicated that SNTHERM
   had a better overall agreement to the measurements as compared with UEB.
   Major differences between the two models were found in the calculation
   of sensible heat flux and snow surface temperature, which were sensitive
   to the correction for atmospheric stability and snow thermal
   conductivity, respectively. The comparison of the SNTHERM results to the
   eddy-correlation measurements of sensible heat flux supported the use of
   a restricted correction for atmospheric stability. The forest canopy had
   a notable effect on the short-wave radiation balance, the vertical wind
   profile, and the measured sensible heat flux. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Continuous observations of the meteorological elements and heat fluxes
   were made for more than one and a half years above and in a red pine
   forest. We obtained the following results from these observations: 1)
   During the spring thaw, the albedo above the forest decreased as snow
   depth decreased and reached a minimum Value after the snow disappeared.
   Due to seasonal Variation in the canopy structure, the ratios of
   insolation and wind speed at the forest floor compared to those above
   the forest canopy also varied. 2) Under dry canopy conditions, the peaks
   of each heat balance component occurred at different times. The net
   radiation peaked in June; the latent heat flux peaked in July; the
   sensible heat flux peaked in May; the heat storage on the ground peaked
   in March. When the forest floor was snow-covered, the Bowen ratio was
   more than 1.0 and the maximum ratio of sensible heat flux to net
   radiation occurred. The forest canopy over the snow surface acted as a
   heat source because the direction of the sensible heat flux was upward
   above the forest canopy. 3) The seasonal change in evaporation
   efficiency was similar to that in the air temperature above the canopy.
   When the daily air temperature was below 10 degrees C, the transpiration
   was limited. 4) Snowcover on the forest floor also affected the
   relationships between evaporation efficiency and meteorological
   conditions. This was caused by properties of the snowcover. Copyright

Abstract = {{Physically-based models of blowing snow and windflow are used to develop
   a distributed model of blowing snow transport and sublimation over
   complex terrain. The model is applied to an arctic tundra basin. A
   reasonable agreement with results from snow surveys is obtained,
   provided sublimation processes an included; a simulation without
   sublimation produces much greater snow accumulations than were measured.
   The model is able to reproduce some observed features of redistributed
   snowcovers: distributions of snow mass, classified by vegetation type
   and landform, can be approximated by lognormal distributions, and
   standard deviations of snow mass along transects follow a power law with
   transect length up to a cut-off. The representation used for the
   downwind development of blowing snow with changes in windspeed and
   surface characteristics is found to have a large moderating influence on
   snow redistribution. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate distributed simulation of snowpack deposition and ablation
   beneath forest canopies is complicated by the fact that vegetation
   canopies strongly affect the snow surface energy balance. The canopy
   alters the radiation balance of the snowcover and reduces the wind speed
   at the snow surface. Simple canopy adjustment algorithms for solar and
   thermal radiation and wind speed are used in conjunction with commonly
   available land cover classifications to spatially distribute sub-canopy
   solar and thermal radiation, air and soil temperature, humidity, wind
   speed, and precipitation. The distributed climate surfaces are used to
   drive a two-layer coupled energy- and mass-balance snowmelt model over
   two areas within the BOREAS study region for the 1994-1995 snow season.
   Model results are validated using both automatic and manually collected
   snow depth data. The simulated timing and rate of snowpack development
   and ablation at both study areas are well represented beneath the canopy
   types where validation data are present. Rigorous evaluation of model
   performance beneath the full range of canopy types requires information
   regarding the spatial distribution of snow covered area during the
   ablation period. This study demonstrates that given basic landcover
   parameters, relatively simple canopy adjustments coupled with an energy
   balance model can be used to estimate climate conditions and snowcover
   processes across a range of boreal forest covers. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The effects of landscape changes on winter and spring snow-related
   processes, and on regional weather and climate are not thoroughly
   understood. In this study, a climate version of the Regional Atmospheric
   Modelling System (ClimRAMS) is used to investigate the effects of
   landscape change on seasonal snow depletion and its corresponding
   effects on atmospheric and hydrologic processes. Two simulations of the
   1996 spring melt season in the Rocky Mountains and Northern Great Plains
   are compared. The first simulation utilizes the present-day vegetation
   distribution, and the second uses the same vegetation distribution with
   the exception that all forested regions are replaced by grassland. This
   vegetation modification affects 18\% of the domain and changes the leaf
   area index, transmissivity of the vegetation canopy to incoming solar
   radiation, roughness length, and surface albedo. Additional snow-related
   differences occur because the snow lying over grass, and the snow under
   the forest canopy, exist in dramatically different radiative and thermal
   regimes. The snowcover changes resulting from the simulated
   deforestation influence the surface radiation balance, which leads to
   changes in surface sensible and latent energy fluxes, evaporation and
   transpiration rates, melt rates, and air temperature. The vegetation
   change also modifies snowcover depletion rates, which in turn cause
   variations in runoff production. Unmodified regions are affected through
   hydrologic transport processes. The manifestations of these changes with
   respect to regional weather and climate are discussed. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{We developed and evaluated a three-layer snow model for application in
   general circulation models. This one-dimensional snow model has many
   features of the detailed physically based model SNTHERM, yet is
   computationally much simpler. We have also extended the point model to
   vegetated areas using the parameterization concepts of the
   Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS). Results of model
   applications for two types of vegetated fields - a short grassland in
   the French Alps and an old aspen forest in the southern study area of
   BOREAS - were presented. The results, on one hand, indicate the
   suitability of the model structure and parameter setting; on the other
   hand, the results explore the limitation of using `point' field
   observations to evaluate an area model. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Snow is a complex porous medium where liquid water may rise to several
   centimeters high due to capillary rise.
   Previous experimental measurements in cold laboratory on wet snow
   samples allowed us to relate the capillary rise level with snow
   characteristics (porosity, grain size).
   In this study, a network model was adapted to snow to simulate this
   phenomenon. The pore texture of a wet snow block is simulated by a cubic
   lattice of cylindrical tubes. Tube lengths are the same, equal to the
   mesh size of the lattice. Their circular sections vary with the two
   dimensional pore size distribution, computed from image analysis of thin
   sections. At a given height, a tube contains water if the two following
   conditions are fulfilled: first, it should be thin enough in radius so
   that capillary pressure balances hydrostatic pressure at this level;
   second, there exists a continuous path of such links that connects the
   bottom of the lattice.
   Simulations are systematically compared to observations of the maximum
   level of capillary rise for ten different snow samples. Simulated
   profiles of liquid water content are compared to vertical thin sections
   of three refrozen samples of saturated snow. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Air permeability and capillary pressure are macroscopic snow properties
   that are influenced by the pore structure of the snow cover. Formulas
   for predicting fluid transport, species elution, and acoustive wave
   propagation require parameterization of one or both of these properties.
   We report paired measurements of permeability and capillary rise from
   snow samples at field sites in Hanover. New Hampshire, and Sleepers
   River Research Watershed, Danville, Vermont. We augment these data with
   laboratory tests on sieved snow and glass beads. Our measurements
   demonstrate a linear relationship between permeability and the ratio of
   porosity and the square of capillary rise, which we corroborate
   theoretically using a simple conduit model of the pore space. We propose
   that scatter in the data results, in part, from the effect of crystal
   shape on air flow and imbibition contact angle.
   Since the early measurements and classification schemes of Bader in
   1939, many investigators have expanded the database of permeability
   observations for a wide range of snow types. We summarize these data and
   report our own recent observations from the New England sites and from
   an additional site in Manitoba, Canada. Our measurements are in the high
   range of reported values. However, after normalizing our data by the
   square of grain diameter, they follow the empirical function of Shimizu
   fairly closely. This agreement supports our measurements, and
   demonstrates the usefulness of Shimizu's function for snow types other
   than the relatively dense, fine-grained snow used in his analysis.
   Our normalized permeability data for low density snow, as well as the
   Shimizu function, are below theoretical predictions for suspensions of
   spheres and infinite cylinders. Hy extending the model for spheres to
   oblate spheroids and discs, we estimate permeability that is in closer
   agreement with our data. We suggest that a decrease in surface-to-volume
   ratio as snow ages may account for a relative increase in normalized
   permeability. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Present radiative transfer methods in physically based energy budget
   models of snow do not include adequate spectral or directional
   resolution to deal with the scattering of solar radiation. This paper
   reports on results from an advanced physically-based snow energy budget
   model, SNTHERM, linked with a discrete ordinate radiative transfer
   model, DISORT, at nine wavelengths assuming spherical snow grains.
   Scattering properties were averaged over a small range of grain sizes
   (as seen in real snow) to eliminate interference induced fluctuations.
   A method was derived to split a single measurement of spectrally
   integrated solar radiation into its direct and diffuse components at
   nine wavelengths. The split of radiation is required as input to the
   radiative transfer model, and is produced as a weighted average from
   days of total cloud cover and days of clear skies (from the 6S
   atmosphere radiative transfer model). The fully linked model was tested
   on a data set from a field campaign on the Uranus Glacier, Antarctica,
   December 1994-February 1995. An automated weather station provided
   meteorological inputs, with additional measurements made of solar
   radiation. A vertical array of thermistors made continuous measurements
   of snowpack temperature in the top metre of snow, though those
   thermistors near the surface were contaminated by solar heating and
   melting. Snow pit data were used to initialize the model. The combined
   model was tested against simpler radiative transfer parameterizations,
   with variations in grain size and solar zenith angle, or fixed albedo
   and extinction techniques. Albedo predictions from the discrete ordinate
   radiative transfer model show large variations in albedo with solar
   zenith angle and the diffuse and direct spectral radiative split. The
   spectral method provided superior results for snowpack temperatures over
   the test period. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method to estimate the amount of snow melt using
   hourly data of total snow depth and precipitation. Based on viscous
   compression theory and an empirical relation between compressive
   viscosity and density of snow, an equation was derived to compute the
   time variation of the thickness of a snow layer due to viscous
   compression. Using the equation, the present height of the previous snow
   surface was computed, and the depth of hourly snowfall was estimated as
   the difference between the present height of the previous snow surface
   and the measured present total snow depth. Substituting precipitation to
   this depth as the weight of the snow layer, the depth and weight of each
   hourly snow layer was estimated. Depth of snow melt was estimated by
   subtracting the measured thickness of snow depth reduction from the
   estimated thickness of snow compaction. The amount of snow melt was
   estimated as the estimated dry weight of these snow layer which was lost
   by snow melt. The approximated results agree well with estimated
   results, by an alternative method used at the Tohkamachi experimental
   station in 1994/95. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sublimation from the seasonal snowpack was calculated using the
   aerodynamic profile method at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range.
   Past studies of sublimation from snow have been inconclusive in
   determining both the rate and timing of the transfer of water between
   the snowpack and the atmosphere, primarily because they relied on
   one-dimensional measurements of turbulent fluxes or I;hort term data
   sets. We calculated latent heat fluxes at ten minute intervals based on
   measurements of temperature, relative humidity and wind speed at heights
   of 0.5 m, 1.0 m and 2.0 m above the snowpack for nine months during the
   1994-1995 snow season. The meteorological instruments were raised or
   lowered daily to maintain a constant height above the snow surface. At
   each ten minute time step, the latent heat fluxes were converted
   directly into millimeters of sublimation or condensation. Total net
   sublimation for the snow season was 195 mm of water equivalent, or 15\%
   of maximum snow accumulation at the study site. The majority of this
   sublimation occurred during the snow accumulation season. Monthly losses
   to sublimation during the fall and winter ranged from 27 to 54 mm of
   water equivalent. The snowmelt season from May through mid-July showed
   net condensation to the snowpack ranging from 5 to 16 mm of water
   equivalent. Sublimation was sometimes episodic in nature, but often
   showed a diurnal periodicity with higher rates of sublimation during the
   day. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the effect of the physical characteristics of the snowpack
   on the onset of snowmelt runoff is needed for the modelling of snowmelt
   runoff. In the present study, the importance of ice layers in the
   snowpack to the release of meltwater has been investigated. Artificial
   rain was simulated over a snow plot of known dimensions prepared in the
   Glatzbach Basin in the Austrian Alps. The experiment was performed at an
   altitude of 2640 m just before the onset of snowmelt runoff from the
   snowpack at that altitude. Stratigraphic studies were made before and
   after the experiment. The snowpack contained five ice layers and the
   thickness of these layers varied from about 2 to 8 mm. The average
   liquid water content of the snowpack was about 4\% by volume before the
   rain simulation. The results indicate a substantial increase in the
   storage capacity of the snowpack due to the presence of ice layers in
   the snowpack when it met saturated conditions because of rain water
   input. An amount equivalent to 100 mm, which is about 9.25\% by volume,
   was absorbed by the snow block before the appearance of runoff from the
   snowplot. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The flowpaths of meltwater through snow is known to be an inhomogeneous
   process. The spatial distribution of meltwater flowing from the bottom
   off melting snowpacks is the result of horizontal and vertical flow
   paths within the snowpack. The ability to characterize the spatial
   distribution of these meltwater flow paths would be useful in developing
   models of snow melt runoff which could better characterize snow melt
   hydrographs. We analyzed near infrared aerial photos of melting snow
   using a moving window analysis which, can characterize correlation
   lengths in the reflectance of the snow surface. Near infrared is
   sensitive to snow grain size, which in turn may indicate higher amounts
   of meltwater; the grains grow faster if the liquid water content is
   higher. Correlation lengths were five to seven metres and the
   probability of finding such correlation lengths increased from 0.22 in
   May 1997 when the melt had just started to 0.68 by late June when melt
   was well established. Liquid water content at the snow surface was
   sampled with a dielectric sensor at 0.5 m intervals on 100 m(2) and 75
   m(2) grids. Semi-variograms showed a sill at five to six metres. The
   liquid water measurements at the snow surface suggest that the
   correlation lengths derived from the infrared aerial photos represent
   surface expressions of higher flow density through the melting snowpack.
   A circular array of 16 snow melt lysimeters each with areas of 0.2 m(2)
   was operated for two years at Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range.
   Variograms indicated that flows were correlated over a distance of five
   to seven metres. These three independent methods all suggest a spatial
   organization of five to seven metres for flowpaths draining ripe
   snowpacks in the Rocky Mountains. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{A general parametric correlation for estimating snowmelt infiltration
   into frozen soils is developed using the results from a numerical model,
   HAWTS. This model includes a set of partial differential equations that
   describe water and heat transport with phase changes in frozen soils.
   The model was run for soils with average textures ranging from sandy
   loam to clay.
   The relationship proposed relates infiltration to the total soil
   moisture saturation (water + ice) and temperature at the start of snow
   ablation, the soil surface saturation during melting, and the
   infiltration opportunity time - the time that meltwater is available at
   the soil surface for infiltration. The expression is calibrated to
   predict snowmelt infiltration in boreal forest and prairie environments.
   Comparisons of estimates of infiltration by the empirical relationship
   with those determined by field measurement suggest that the correlation
   will provide acceptable estimates of snowmelt infiltration into frozen
   mineral soils for use in operational hydrology schemes. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Soil frost depth has been monitored at the Sleepers River Research
   Watershed in northeastern Vermont since 1984. Soil frost develops every
   winter, particularly in open fields, but its depth varies greatly from
   year to year in inverse relation to snow depth. During the 15 years of
   record at a benchmark mid-elevation open site, the annual maximum frost
   depth varied from 70 to 390 mm. We empirically tested the hypothesis
   that frozen soil prevents infiltration and recharge, thereby causing an
   increased runoff ratio (Streamflow/(rain + snowmelt)) during the
   snowmelt hydrograph rise and a decreased runoff ratio during snowmelt
   recession. The hypothesis was not supported at the 111 km(2) W-5
   catchment; there was no significant correlation of the runoff ratio with
   the seasonal maximum frost depth for either the pre-peak or post-peak
   period. In an analysis of four events, however, the presence of frost
   promoted a large and somewhat quick:er response to rainfall relative to
   the no-frost condition, although snow cover caused a much greater
   time-to-peak regardless of frost status. For six years of flow and frost
   depth measured at the 59 ha agricultural basin W-2., the hypothesis
   appeared to be supported. The enhancement of runoff due to soil frost is
   evident on small plots and in extreme events, such as rain on frozen
   snow-free soil. In the northeastern USA and eastern Canada, the effect
   is often masked in larger catchments by several confounding factors,
   including storage of meltwater in the snowpack, variability in snowmelt
   timing due to elevational and aspect differences, interspersed forested
   land where frost may be absent, and the timing of soil thawing relative
   to the runoff peak.}},

Abstract = {{This study determines how representative the snowmelt values computed
   using arctic weather station data are of the melt in its surrounding
   area. Simultaneous measurements of meteorological variables were made at
   several sites to permit comparisons of their calculated snowmelt with
   the weather station at Resolute, Northwest Territories, Canada. Like
   mast other stations, the Resolute site is located near the coast, at an
   airport and close to human settlement, making it warmer and its snow
   albedo lower than its adjacent sites. Snowmelt rates at Resolute are
   higher than that of a flat site away from the airport. This latter site
   has snowmelt conditions more typical of the rolling terrain nearby, but
   its melt rates are higher than those for an inland site where the snow
   remains longer than at the coastal zone. Through these simultaneous
   observations and systematic comparisons, this study indicates that the
   point data from coastal, arctic stations are unlikely to be
   representative of their surrounding areas. Thus, caution should be
   exercised when applying such information directly to the computation of
   snowmelt for entire grid cells of macro-hydrologic models. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Urban water balances differ from their rural counterparts due to extreme
   spatial heterogeneity, water imported from outside catchment boundaries
   and changed flow paths (e.g., drainage pipes and impervious surfaces).
   Urban catchments are characterized by increased peak discharges and fast
   response times, each contributing to specific environmental problems.
   The water balances of towns in the northern high latitudes are further
   complicated by snow which represents an energy dependent seasonal water
   store.
   This paper investigates the monthly water balance of Lulea (June 1992 to
   June 1996), a Swedish town of 71 000 inhabitants 100 km south of the
   Arctic Circle. The town has snow cover for five to six months of the
   year and thaw is usually in late April. Data available included daily
   precipitation, temperature and inflow to the Uddebo waste water
   treatment plant; and monthly potential evapotranspiration, groundwater
   levels and water supply statistics.
   Of interest were the seasonal differences in runoff volumes and flow
   pathways to the waste water treatment plant and receiving waters. It was
   found that increased volumes of runoff, reduced concentration times and
   long duration led to flooding and high waste water loads at the
   treatment plant. The surface water component of sewage originates from
   direct flow into pipe inlets and infiltration into sewer pipes. Autumn
   and spring were found to be the periods of groundwater recharge,
   although frozen soil can limit water percolation. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{An elevation-dependent snowmelt forecasting model, combining a
   rainfall-runoff model with a snowmelt module, is developed for use in
   upland Britain. Here, the dynamic nature of snow cover, and the
   occurrence of heavy rain along with melt, can exert a considerable
   influence on major floods. The model comprises the PACK snowmelt model
   linked to a lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff model, the PDM
   (Probability Distributed Moisture) model. The PACK snowmelt module
   conceptualizes the lying snow as being made up of dry snow that has yet
   to melt and wet snow which has melted but is still held in the snowpack.
   When the temperature is above the melt threshold the dry snow melts and
   contributes to the wet snow store. Water is released from the wet snow
   store at a rate dependent on the proportion of the pack that is melted
   snow, and is transformed into flow at the basin outlet by the
   rainfall-runoff model. The variation of temperature with elevation in a
   catchment and its effect on melt can be incorporated into the model by
   partitioning the catchment into a finite number of elevation zones.
   Model performance is generally improved through the use of more zones.
   This result prompted the development of a snowmelt model that can use
   either a near-continuous distribution or a finite number of elevation
   zones derived from a digital terrain model. The new snowmelt model is
   tested on two upland catchments, Monachyle Burn in Scotland and Trout
   Beck in northern England. Flow simulation accuracy is compared for a
   range of choices of elevation zone number in order to determine the
   optimum number to use for a given catchment. Visual observations of the
   position of the snowline are also compared with model predictions. Daily
   snow survey and hourly snow pillow measurements are compared with point
   model predictions of snow water equivalent. They are also assimilated
   into the linked snowmelt and rainfall-runoff model so as to improve the
   accuracy of the flow forecasts. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Because of the crucial role snowmelt plays in many watersheds around the
   world, it is important to understand and accurately quantify the melt
   process. As such, numerous mathematical models attempting to describe
   and predict snowmelt have arisen. There are two main categories of
   models: conceptual index models and more intricate energy balance
   models. The index models, like the degree-day or radiation index models,
   are practical enough for use in large basins for operational purposes;
   while the energy balance models, though they are complicated and require
   large amounts of data, can represent the physics behind melt and give
   more accurate representations of the spatial distribution of melt within
   small research basins. The ABC model presented here attempts to bridge
   the gap between these two extremes by providing a simple yet physically
   justifiable method that uses elevation and radiation indices together
   with some measurements to distribute melt over a watershed. This new
   model separates the energy that causes snowmelt into three components: a
   spatially uniform component, a component that is proportional to
   elevation, and one that is proportional to solar illumination (which is
   determined by topography). Measurements of snowmelt;It several
   topographically unique points (called `index points') in a watershed are
   related to elevation and solar illumination through regression in order
   to factor the melt energy into the three separate components at each
   time step. The model is driven using inputs from snowmelt measurements
   at the index locations used to calibrate the regression at each time
   step. Then the spatial patterns of solar illumination and elevation are
   used to predict the spatial distribution of melt over the whole
   watershed. Field data supplemented with synthetically generated data is
   used to test the model. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Representation of sub-element scale variability in snow accumulation and
   ablation is increasingly recognized as important in distributed
   hydrologic modelling. Representing sub-grid scale variability may be
   accomplished through numerical integration of a nested grid or through a
   lumped modelling approach. We present a physically based model of the
   lumped snowpack mass and energy balance applied to a 26-ha rangeland
   catchment with high spatial variability in snow accumulation and melt.
   Model state variables are snow-covered area average snow energy content
   (U), the basin-average snow water equivalence (W-a), and snow-covered
   area fraction (A(f)) The energy state variable is evolved through an
   energy balance. The snow water equivalence state variable is evolved
   through a mass balance, and the area state variable is updated according
   to an empirically derived relationship, A(f)(W-a), that is similar in
   nature to depletion curves used in existing empirical basin snowmelt
   models. As snow accumulates, the snow covered area increases rapidly. As
   the snowpack ablates, A(f) decreases as W-a decreases. This paper shows
   how the relationship A(f)(W-a) for the melt season can be estimated from
   the distribution of snow water equivalence at peak accumulation in the
   area being modelled. We show that the depletion curve estimated from the
   snow distribution of peak accumulation at the Upper Sheep Creek
   sub-basin of Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed compares well against
   the observed depletion data as well as modelled depletion data from an
   explicit spatially distributed energy balance model. Comparisons of
   basin average snow water equivalence between the lumped model and
   spatially distributed model show good agreement. Comparisons to observed
   snow water equivalence show poorer but still reasonable agreement. The
   sub-grid parameterization is easily portable to other physically based
   point snowmelt models. It has potential application for use in
   hydrologic and climate models covering large areas with large model
   elements, where a computationally inexpensive parameterization of
   sub-grid snow processes may be important. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Snowmelt is the principal source for soil moisture, ground-water
   re-charge, and stream-flow in mountainous regions of the western US,
   Canada, and other similar regions of the world. Information on the
   timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or
   changing climate conditions is required for successful water and
   resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model ISNOBAL is
   used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover
   in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations
   are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km(2), with simulation
   periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake
   watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area
   in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of
   radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation
   results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water
   equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and
   depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow
   deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction
   between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in
   mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically
   distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and
   watershed management. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff forecasting in the case of seasonally snow covered small
   catchments with shallow snowpacks requires application of a quasi
   physical approach wherein the dominant snow accumulation and melting
   processes are accounted for by an intensive physically based modelling
   approach and transformation of the snowmelt and the rainfall to
   streamflow is accounted for by a conceptual modelling approach. In the
   case of shallow snowpacks both high and low water saturation can occur
   more frequently and therefore the physically based multilayer snowmelt
   model must account for capillary pressure gradients as well as gravity
   drainage. One such physically based snowmelt model entitled UCGVDSM
   which accounts for coupled transport of mass and energy into the
   snowpack, is first validated on point snowmelt data of the Kuhtai
   station located in Austria. UCGVDSM is then applied to the Ticha Orlice
   catchment (96.8 km(2)) located in the Czech Republic. It is shown how
   the constraints of data availability for application of the physically
   based snowmelt model can be handled to reproduce accurately, the snow
   water equivalent (SWE), the snow depth (H) and the melt water flux
   (qmelt). The snowmelt rates thus obtained for the snowcover periods are
   then incorporated along with the rainfall and the evapotranspiration
   data into the Soil Moisture Accounting and Routing model (SMAR), a
   conceptual rainfall runoff model. It is shown that incorporating a
   number of statistical modelling techniques into the SMAR model has no
   effect on the model performance while accounting for physical processes
   improves the model performance. Finally, an updating component is
   incorporated into the SMAR model to allow its application in a
   forecasting mode. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Arctic snow cover usually attains maximum values at the end of winter
   and such information is important for hydrological investigations
   because most floods are associated with spring snowmelt. Snow data from
   weather stations or collected at some local sites are often extrapolated
   to large areas, but without verifying that the upscaling procedure
   yields correct results. This study compares maximum snow cover data
   gathered over two large target areas (170 to 300 km(2)) with weather
   station snow course measurements to determine the representativeness of
   local-scale data for areas typically occupied by large grid cells of
   macro-hydrological models. The field snow survey results confirmed the
   controlling role of terrain on snow distribution in the High Arctic. The
   variability of areal mean snow water equivalence for a grid cell (with
   dimensions of 1 x 1 km(2) to 13 x 13 km(2)) increases with terrain
   complexity but decreases with grid size. Although point data do not
   represent the snow cover over an area, an attempt was made to upscale
   the weather station data to the target areas using an index method. Test
   results show that this ender approach works well in the area with a
   shallow snow cover, but the error increases for an area with relatively
   deep snow. More effort is needed to refine this method, perhaps in
   conjunction with remote sensing, so that point data can be upscaled to
   yield snow information suitable for large-scale hydrological models or
   land surface schemes. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the performance of a conceptual modelling system and
   several physically-based models for predicting runoff in a large
   hydrological basin, Tasersuaq, in west Greenland. This basin, which is
   typical of many Greenland basins, is interesting because of the fast
   hydrological response to changing conditions. Due to the predominance of
   exposed bedrock surface and only minor occurrence of sediments and
   organic soils, there is little restraint to run-off, making the
   treatment of the snowmelt component of primary importance.
   Presently a conceptual modelling system, HBV, is applied in Greenland
   and also in most of the arctic regions of Scandinavia for operational
   forecasting. A general wish to use hydrological models for other
   purposes, such as to improve data collection and to gain insight into
   the hydrological processes has promoted interest in the more
   physically-based hydrological models. In this paper, two degree-day
   models, the Danish version of the physically-based SHE distributed
   hydrological modelling system (MIKE SHE) and the conceptual HEY model
   are compared with a new model that links MIKE SHE and a distributed
   energy balance model developed for this study, APUT.
   The HBV model performs the best overall simulation of discharge, which
   presently makes it most suited for general forecasting. The combination
   of MIKE SHE and APUT i.e. a physically based modelling system shows
   promising results by improving the timing of the initiation of spring
   flood, but does not perform as well throughout the remaining part of the
   snowmelt season. The modelling study shows that local parameters such as
   the snow depletion curve, the temporal snow albedo and perhaps also melt
   water storage need to be more precisely determined from field studies
   before physically-based modelling can be improved. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Topographically distributed energy- and water-balance models can
   accurately simulate both the development and melting of a seasonal
   snowcover in the mountain basins. To do this they require time-series
   climate surfaces of air temperature, humidity, wind speed,
   precipitation, and solar and thermal radiation. If data are available,
   these parameters can be adequately estimated at time steps of one to
   three hours. Unfortunately, climate monitoring in mountain basins is
   very limited, and the full range of elevations and exposures that affect
   climate conditions, snow deposition, and melt is seldom sampled.
   Detailed time-series climate surfaces have been successfully developed
   using limited data and relatively simple methods. We present a synopsis
   of the tools and methods used to combine limited data with simple
   corrections for the topographic controls to generate high temporal
   resolution time-series images of these climate parameters. Methods used
   include simulations, elevational gradients, and detrended kriging. The
   generated climate surfaces are evaluated at points and spatially to
   determine if they are reasonable approximations of actual conditions.
   Recommendations are made for the addition of critical parameters and
   measurement sites into routine monitoring systems in mountain basins.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff in glacierized alpine basins results from both seasonal snow
   cover and glacier melt. In this paper we present a case study for an
   improved runoff modelling of the basin Massa-Blatten, 196 km(2),
   1447-4191 m a.s.l. Using high resolution satellite sensors, it is
   possible to separately map snow cover and glacier areas. From the
   satellite data we derive depletion curves of snow covered areas in six
   elevation zones and determine when the glacier ice becomes exposed. We
   compute melt depths based on experimental measurements with regard to
   snow and ice. With the use of the snowmelt runoff model SRM-ETH, the
   following input components to runoff were determined: seasonal snow
   cover, including new snow falling on the snow covered areas; new snow
   falling on the snow-free area; rain; and glacier-ice. In order to
   evaluate the effect of the refined snow and glacier mapping on detailed
   melt computations, we compute the runoff resulting from i) the
   conventional runoff simulation based on integral snow and glacier areas,
   and ii) and advanced simulation taking into account the individual
   contributions from snow cover and glacier melt. We achieve a significant
   improvement of the accuracy of the runoff simulation. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Field campaigns were undertaken in May and June of 1992 and 1997 in
   order to study spectral reflectance characteristics of snow during
   melt-off. The investigations were performed on snow-covered tundra at
   Ny-Alesund, Svalbard (79 degrees N). Spectral measurements were acquired
   with spectroradiometers covering wavelengths from 350 to 2500 nm.
   Supporting measurements such as snow thickness, density, content of
   liquid water, grain size and shape, stratification of snowpack, as well
   as cloud observations and air temperature, were monitored throughout the
   field campaigns. Spectral measurements demonstrate that the
   near-infrared albedo is most affected by the ongoing snow metamorphism
   while the albedo in the visible wavelength range is more strongly
   affected by surface pollution. Comparisons of spectral measurements and
   spectrally integrated measurements emphasize the need for narrow-band to
   broad-band conversion when applying satellite-derived albedo to surface
   energy-balance calculations. As an example, Landsat TM Band 4 albedo is
   shown to produce slightly high albedo values compared to the spectrally
   integrated, albedo (285-2800 nm), Daily albedo measurements from
   1981-1997 show that the albedo normally drops from 80\% to bare ground
   levels (similar to 10\%) within two to four weeks and the date when the
   tundra becomes snow-free varies from early June to early July. Thus, the
   changing spectral characteristics of snow during melt off combined with
   a general rapid decrease in albedo call for cautious use of
   satellite-derived albedo, especially when used as absolute numbers. Our
   data also illustrate the effect of cloud cover on surface albedo For an
   event in which the integrated albedo increased by 7\% under cloudy
   conditions compared to clear skies without changes of surface
   properties. Finally, the reflectance of snow increases relative to nadir
   for measurements facing the sun and at azimuths 90 degrees and 180
   degrees by 8, 15, 19, and 26\% for viewing angles 15 degrees, 30
   degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees, respectively, due to anisotropic
   reflection. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{By modelling the snow accumulation process in time and space as sums of
   random gamma distributed variables, the mean areal snow water equivalent
   (SWE) can be estimated. In the methodology we make use of the fact that
   sums of gamma distributed variables with a certain set of parameters
   also are gamma distributed variables with parameters being functions of
   the original and the number of summations. The measured snow/SWE at a
   point and at a certain time t, can thus be seen as the accumulation, or
   the sum of snowfall events from the beginning of the snowfall season up
   to t. The integration of these points over an area, can be seen as
   another summation. From snow pillows and precipitation gauges the value
   of daily accumulated precipitation/snow has been found to be well
   represented by a two parameter gamma distribution. This distribution has
   been found to be representative for large areas. The number of events
   where the precipitation was accumulated can be estimated from snow
   pillows situated in the area. The mean snow coverage over an area, which
   represents the summation of the individual points over an area, can be
   derived from satellite images represented in a GIS. The methodology is
   tested for two nested catchments of size 4723 km(2) and 19 832 km(2) in
   a mountainous area in southern Norway for ten satellite scenes. The
   results are compared with simulated snow reservoirs using a
   rainfall-runoff model, and found to agree well. Large discrepancies in
   the snow reservoirs between the proposed method and the rainfall-runoff
   model are found in late spring and are probably due to errors in the
   estimated mean snow coverage derived from the satellite images.

Abstract = {{Models of daily runoff from seasonal snowpacks and glaciers require
   knowledge or assumptions about the decline in snow covered area (SCA).
   Some semi-distributed models rely on satellite data as an input in
   addition to meteorological data but general purpose hydrological models
   with a snow component do not normally use earth observation (EO) data.
   EO data have the potential to verify or update SCA predictions generated
   by these models, but comparison is hampered by the unrealistic
   assumption in most models of spatially uniform snow water-equivalent
   (SWE) within entire zones, so that SCA decline is stepped. Two possible
   solutions are either to allow a stepped SWE distribution within a
   sub-area, or to assume uniform melt over a non-uniform snowpack within a
   sub-area. In both approaches melt is converted into a reduction in SCA
   as well as SWE allowing snowpack depletion to be compared directly with
   EO data. Two examples are given in which EO data is used to verify (and
   in one case update) SCA. The I-IBV model is applied to a basin in Arctic
   Sweden and a recently developed glacier runoff model is applied to a
   basin in the Swiss Alps. Landsat TM data of both basins revealed
   considerably less snow than simulated by the models. TM data for the
   Swedish basin show that only glacier zones were 100\% snow covered.
   Despite over-predicting SCA both models achieved very good discharge
   fits. It is argued that runoff models should correctly simulate the
   hydrological system state variables if they are to be transferred to
   different environments or new climate scenarios with confidence, and
   that EO data can play a valuable role in this. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Monitoring snow cover in alpine areas is important for the estimation of
   the water storage during the snowmelt season, especially in view of
   irrigation, hydropower production and water supply. Cost-efficiency and
   fine temporal resolution of images from the satellite-borne NOAA-AVHRR
   sensor indicate this source of information as a suitable candidate for
   monitoring snow cover extent. This information can also be used for
   validation of distributed snowmelt models. As a result of a long-term
   study, ten years of snow covered area depletion curves have been
   estimated using remote sensing in seven watersheds of size larger than
   400 km(2) in the Southern Alps.
   Coupling of satellite imagery with detailed topographic data and some
   ground measurements of snowpack depth and density provides regional
   estimates of snow water equivalent in northern Italy, upstream of Lakes
   Maggiore, Come, Iseo, Idro, and Garda. The basin water equivalent
   estimates are compared with the values obtained from the hydrological
   water balance equation used in two of the selected watersheds and
   computed for different snowmelt seasons. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley

Abstract = {{An evaluation of the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) snow
   submodel was conducted, both in a stand-alone mode and within the
   National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model
   version 3 (CCM3). We evaluated, in the stand-alone mode, the performance
   of BATS parameterizations at local scales using ground-based
   observations from the former Soviet Union and from Mammoth Mountain,
   California. The BATS snow scheme reproduces well the seasonal evolution
   of snow water equivalent in both sites, and the results for the Mammoth
   Mountain site compare well with those from a more complex, physically
   based model (SNTHERM). In the coupled mode, we evaluated the modelled
   snow cover extent, snow mass, precipitation and temperature from BATS as
   linked to the NCAR CCM3 using available observations. The coupled models
   capture the broad pattern of seasonal and geographical distribution of
   snow cover, with better overall performance than the passive microwave
   snow data derived from the Nimbus-7 Scanning Multi-channel Microwave
   Radiometer (SMMR) which generally underestimates snow depth. In terms of
   continents, the snow mass is better simulated during the accumulation
   period than during the melt period, which is the case for both North
   America and Eurasia. The simulation of snow mass, precipitation and air
   temperature for North America is slightly better than that for Eurasia.
   A rigorous evaluation of snow simulations in coupled land-atmosphere
   models requires high quality global datasets of snow cover extent, snow
   depth and snow water equivalent. The available datasets and model
   outputs are not yet ready to fulfil this objective. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The relationship between stream discharge and the concentration of
   different solutes reflects the hydrological processes occurring in a
   catchment, but is also strongly affected by antecedent moisture
   conditions. In this study, the effects of antecedent conditions were
   examined for a small forested watershed near Montreal (Quebec) by
   comparing data from sequences of fall events for two years of
   contrasting antecedent moisture conditions. The relationship between
   discharge and stream water chemistry was also quantified using
   crosscorrelation analysis. Results show that concentrations of dissolved
   organic carbon, nitrate and calcium increased during storm events with
   dry antecedent conditions but that the relationships were weaker under
   wet conditions. For both years, concentrations of sulfate, silicon and
   sodium and the pH were negatively correlated with discharge
   (cross-correlations from -0.20 to -0.53). With dry antecedent
   conditions, there was a general decrease in the concentration of all
   solutes with time, whereas concentrations remained at about the same
   level under wet conditions. The concentration-discharge relationships
   for sulfate shifted frequently from higher concentrations during the
   rising limb to higher concentrations during the falling limb from one
   event to another as a result of changing antecedent conditions. Although
   the contrast in antecedent moisture conditions between the two years was
   moderate in comparison with that reported in other studies (25\% dryer
   than average in 1995 and 12\% wetter than average in 1996), the
   hydrochemistry of the stream was markedly different. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{To investigate groundwater transit times and flow paths in shallow till
   soil, within an acidification study at Gardsjon, Sweden, two line
   injections of Cl-36 and H-3 Were made in groundwater during 1992. The
   first injection in January, when the two tracers were injected at the
   same depth, gave tracer transit times from injection line to outlet of
   some hours due to a runoff event on the first day. The subsequent
   recession period left a considerable amount of tracer in the unsaturated
   zone, which had transit times that ranged from weeks to months. Tracer
   recovery at the outlet was 78\% for H-3 and 47\% for Cl-36. Cl retention
   was indicated. The second injection in November, when H-3 was injected
   at 30 cm depth and 36C1 at 60 cm depth, gave recoveries of 96\% for H-3
   and 83\% for Cl-36. Apart from an advective flow-dependent tracer
   transport, very fast tracer pulses occurred. The velocities for those
   pulses were of the order of tens of metres per hour. Highest tracer
   concentrations were observed in the superficial soil layers, which
   suggest that these layers were the dominant flow paths. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{The behaviour of a discrete sub-bank-full flow event in a small desert
   stream in western NSW, Australia, is analysed from direct observation
   and sediment sampling during the flow event and from later channel
   surveys. The flow event, the result of an isolated afternoon
   thunderstorm, had a peak discharge of 9 m(3)/s at an upstream station.
   Transmission loss totally consumed the flow over the following 7.6 km.
   Suspended sediment concentration was highest at the flow front (not the
   discharge peak) and declined linearly with the log of time since passage
   of the flow front, regardless of discharge variation. The transmission
   loss responsible for the waning and eventual cessation of Row occurred
   at a mean rate of 13.2\% per km. This is quite rapid, and is more than
   twice the corresponding figure for bank-full flows estimated by
   Dunkerley (1992) on the same stream system. It is proposed that
   transmission losses in ephemeral streams of the kind studied may be
   minimized in flows near bank-full stage, and be higher in both
   sub-bank-full and overbank flows. Factors contributing to enhanced Row
   loss in the sub-bank-full flow studied included abstractions of Row to
   pools, scour holes and other low points along the channel, and overflow
   abstractions into channel filaments that did not rejoin the main flow.
   On the other hand, losses were curtailed by the shallow depth of banks
   wetted and by extensive mud drapes that were set down over sand bars and
   other porous channel materials during the how. Thus, in contrast with
   the relatively regular pattern of transmission loss inferred from large
   floods, losses from low flows exhibit marked spatial variability and
   depend to a considerable extent on streamwise variations in channel
   geometry, in addition to the depth and porosity of channel perimeter
   sediments. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In order to develop an effective approach to estimate evaporation and
   evapotranspiration (ET) in the glacierized watershed for hydrological
   process studies, the meteorological and energy budget data obtained in
   1986 from a small watershed at the headwater of Urumqi River Basin,
   Tianshan, China were utilized. The field observation of ET and surface
   soil water content was briefly described. The performance of several
   existing approaches in estimating the daily actual ET and evaporation
   for the two kinds of predominant ground surface in the basin (i.e. the
   alpine tundra and glacier surface) was examined. The estimated daily ET
   from the alpine tundra for the summer season by Morton's equation
   correlates fairly well with the lysimeter-observed data, and the
   proposed wetness index by means of the principle of Morton's
   complementary relationship, provided reliable information of the surface
   soil wetness condition for the same period. For the other seasons,
   Kojima's equation was adopted for estimation of daily evaporation on
   both alpine tundra and the glacier surface when most parts of the
   watershed were snow covered. The daily evaporation on the glacier
   surface for the melting season was ultimately estimated by Ohno's
   equation for the non-melting season. The monthly mean evaporation
   estimated for the glacier surface was close to the field observation
   data obtained in 1987-1988, The annual evaporation obtained on both
   sites by this approach was in good agreement with that estimated with
   the water balance method for the same sites by Zhang et nl. (1992).

Abstract = {{The need for powerful validation methods fbr hydrological models
   including the evaluation of internal stages and spatially distributed
   simulations has often been emphasized. In this study a multi-criterial
   validation scheme was used for validation of TOPMODEL, a conceptual
   semi-distributed rainfall-runoff model. The objective was to test
   TOPMODEL's capability of adequately representing dominant hydrological
   processes by simple conceptual approaches. Validation methods differed
   in the type of data used, in their target and in mode. The model was
   applied in the humid and mountainous Brugga catchment (40 km(2)) in
   south-west Germany. It was calibrated by a Monte Carlo method based on
   hourly runoff data. Additional information for validation was derived
   from a recession analysis, hydrograph separation with environmental
   tracers and from field surveys, including the mapping of saturated
   areas. Although runoff simulations were satisfying, inadequacies of the
   model structure compared with the real situation with regard to
   hydrological processes in the study area were found. These belong mainly
   to the concept of variable contributing areas for saturation excess
   overland flow and their dynamics, which were overestimated by the model.
   The simple TOPMODEL approach of two flow components was found to be
   insufficient. The multi-criterial validation scheme enables not only to
   demonstrate limitations with regard to process representation, but also
   to specify where and why these limitations occur. It may serve as a
   valuable tool for the development of physically sound model
   modifications. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In the region of the basaltic plateau in Southern Brazil, problems of
   runoff and erosion on the deep Ferrallitic soils are becoming
   increasingly recognized. Land use change from conventional tillage using
   disk plough to no-tillage on residues without terracing occurred at the
   beginning of the 1990s and it spread very quickly. Measurements of
   runoff and sediment concentrations on 1 m(2) plots receiving natural
   rainfall and simulated rainfall under different crops with different
   stages of growth and different tillage systems, field surveys and
   measurements of rills and gullies in nested experimental catchments
   indicate a relative decrease of runoff on slopes but an increase of
   subsurface flow, and a marked decrease of sheet and rill erosion and
   soil loss from plot to catchment scales. Nevertheless, the extension of
   parts of the gully system is still continuing, strongly influenced by
   extreme rainfall. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{By considering urbanization on an overland plane as a process whereby a
   relatively rough, permeable surface is gradually replaced by a
   relatively smooth, less permeable surface, the effect of urbanization
   sequence on the flood peak is theoretically assessed by the kinematic
   wave method. In the assessment, two opposing urbanization sequences are
   considered: one from downstream to upstream, and the other from upstream
   to downstream. The assessment is carried out in terms of the individual
   effect as well as the combined effect of the Manning resistance
   coefficient and the runoff coefficient. For both urbanization sequences
   and for all degrees of urbanization, the assessment shows that surface
   conversion from rough to smooth, or from permeable to less permeable
   causes the flood peak to increase. A comparison of the individual
   effects shows that for equal reductions in surface roughness and
   permeability, the reduction in permeability causes greater increases in
   the flood peak compared with the reduction in surface roughness. For a
   partially urbanized plane and for the same degree of urbanization, due
   to the partial area effect, urbanization at the downstream end generally
   causes greater increases in the flood peak. In terms of urbanization
   sequence, the downstream to upstream urbanization sequence generally
   causes greater increases in the flood peak. The effect of urbanization
   sequence on the flood peak, however, is only significant for the larger
   reductions in surface roughness and permeability. Finally, a comparison
   of the results of this study with those obtained from drainage basins
   shows that for most of the results from the basins, they correspond to
   those for the small reductions in surface roughness and permeability on
   an overland plane. For these cases, the effect of urbanization sequence
   on the flood peak is small. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrological-lithostratigraphical model was developed for assessment
   of transmission losses and groundwater recharge from runoff events in
   arid water courses where hydrological and meteorological records are
   incomplete. Water balance equations were established for reaches between
   hydrometric stations. Because rainfall and tributary flow data are
   scarce, lateral inflow, which is an essential component of the water
   balance equation, could not be estimated directly. The solution was
   obtained by developing a method which includes a
   hydrological-lithostratigraphical analogy. This is based on the
   following assumptions: (a) runoff resulting from a given rainfall event
   is related to the watershed surface lithology; (b) for a given event,
   the spatial distribution of runoff reflects the distribution of
   rainfall: and (c) transmission losses are uniquely related to the total
   inflow to the reach. The latter relationship, called the loss function,
   and the water balance equation comprise a model which simultaneously
   assesses lateral inflow and transmission losses for runoff events
   recorded at the terminal stations. The model was applied to three
   reaches of the arid Nahal Tsin in Israel. In this case study, the
   transmission losses were of the same order of magnitude as the flow at
   the major hydrometric stations. The losses were subdivided into channel
   moistening, which subsequently evaporates, and deep percolation, which
   recharges groundwater. For large runoff events, evaporation was
   substantially smaller than the losses. The mean annual recharge of
   groundwater from runoff events in the Tsin watershed was 4.1 x 10(6)
   m(3), while the mean annual flow volume at the major stations ranged
   from 0.6 to 1.5 x 10(6) m(3). Once in 100 years, the annual recharge may
   be seven times higher than the mean annual value, but the recharge
   during most years is very small. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Runoff is one of the main water sources responsible for water
   redistribution within a given ecosystem. Water redistribution is
   especially important in arid regions, and may be of great importance an
   sandy dunes, where the likelihood of runoff is low owing to the high
   infiltration rates of sand. Redistribution of water may significantly
   affect plant and animal distribution, and may explain vegetation
   patterns within an ecosystem.
   Runoff yield over sandy dune slopes in the western Negev Desert was
   measured under natural conditions during 1990-1994. The magnitude of
   runoff yield on different slope sections and on north and south
   exposures was established. The results demonstrate that while slope
   position controlled the microbiotic crust cover, crust cover and crust
   biomass controlled the amounts of runoff obtained. Whereas no runoff was
   measured on the upper dune sections devoid of crust, only meagre
   quantities were measured on the midslope sections, characterized by
   discontinuous crust cover. Substantially larger amounts were, however,
   obtained at the bottoms of the slopes, characterized by continuous crust
   cover. North-facing slopes, usually characterized by a chlorophyll a
   content of 29-41 mg m(-2), yielded on average 3.2 times more runoff than
   south-facing footslopes, characterized by a 17 mg m(-2) chlorophyll a
   content. Whereas microbiotic crust was found to be responsible for
   runoff generation, additional water supply owing to runoff may also
   explain the occurrence of a high biomass crust and the dense vegetation
   belt at the dune-interdune interface of the northern exposure, where
   runoff tends to collect. Thus, whereas crust may reduce in filtration in
   certain habitats, runoff generated by crust may also be responsible for
   the promotion of crust growth in other habitats. Runoff may also be used
   to promote vegetation growth at the dune footslopes. The possibility of
   using runoff to facilitate agroforestry is discussed. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{This paper analyses precipitation occurrence in time. The calculations
   were made with the data from continuous precipitation measurements by
   two automatic float-type rainfall recorders (Hellmann type) during the
   10-year period 1984-1993. The measurement increment was 5 minutes with
   0.1 mm resolution. The effect of different time increments on
   precipitation duration in a year has been researched. Calculations show
   that a smaller time increment diminishes the duration of precipitation
   in a year. If a 5-minute time increment is used for calculation, the
   precipitation duration is about 3\% of the year. If a 24-hour time
   increment is used, the precipitation duration is 33\% of the year. The
   real mean duration of yearly precipitation has been evaluated as 216
   hours, that is 2.47\% of the year. The appearance of a precipitation
   intensity higher than 0.2 mm/min has been researched during the year and
   over 24 hours. Analyses show that intensive precipitation appears during
   the warmer part of the year, from June to August. The precipitation
   distribution is not uniform over a day. In the city of Zagreb, where
   both rain gauge stations are situated, in 90\% of the cases, the
   precipitation intensity higher than 1.2 mm/min falls during the night,
   from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., at the same time causing floods. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{A general infiltration model proposed by Singh and Yu(1990) was
   calibrated and validated using a split sampling approach for 191 sets of
   infiltration data observed in the states of Minnesota and Georgia in the
   USA. Of the five model parameters, f(c)(the final infiltration rate),
   S-o(the available storage space) and exponent `n' were found to be more
   predictable than the other two parameters: m (exponent) and a
   (proportionality factor). A critical examination of the general model
   revealed that it is related to the Soil Conservation Service (1956)
   curve number (SCS-CN) method and its parameter S-o is equivalent to the
   potential maximum retention of the SCS-CN method and is, in turn, found
   to be a function of soil sorptivity and hydraulic conductivity. The
   general model was found to describe infiltration rate with time varying
   curve number. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The partitioning of rain water into throughfall, stemflow and
   interception loss when passing through plant canopies depends on
   properties of the respective plant species, such as leaf area and branch
   angles. In heterogeneous vegetation, such as tropical forest or
   polycultural systems, the presence of different plant species may
   consequently result in a mosaic of situations with respect to quantity
   and quality of water inputs into the soil. As these processes influence
   not only the water availability fbr the plants, but also water
   infiltration and nutrient leaching, the understanding of plant effects
   on the repartitioning of rain water may help in the optimization of land
   use systems and management practices. We measured throughfall and
   stemflow in a perennial polyculture (multi-strata agroforestry),
   monocultures of peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) for fruit and for palmito,
   a monoculture of cupuacu (Theobroma grandiflorum), spontaneous fallow
   and primary forest during one year in central Amazonia, Brazil. The
   effect on rain water partitioning was measured separately for four
   useful tree species in the polyculture and for two tree species in the
   primary forest. Throughfall at two stem distances, and stemflow,
   differed significantly between tree species, resulting in pronounced
   spatial patterns of water input into the soil in the polyculture system.
   For two tree species, peach palm for fruit (Bactris gasipaes) and Brazil
   nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa), the water input into the soil near the
   stem was significantly higher than the open-area rainfall. This could
   lead to increased nutrient leaching when fertilizer is applied close to
   the stem of these trees. In the primary forest, such spatial patterns
   could also be detected, with significantly higher water input near a
   palm (Oenocarpus bacaba) than near a dicotyledonous tree species
   (Eschweilera sp.). Interception losses were 6.4\% in the polyculture,
   13.9 and 12.3\% in the peach palm monocultures for fruit and for
   palmito, respectively, 0.5\% in the cupuacu monoculture and 3.1\% in the
   fallow. With more than 20\% of the open-area rainfall, the highest
   stemflow contributions to the water input into the soil were measured in
   the palm monocultures and in the fallow. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The behaviour of suspended sediment in rivers is often a function of
   energy conditions, i.e. sediment is stored at low flow and transported
   under high discharge conditions. The timing of maximum sediment
   transport can, however, also be related to mixing and routing of water
   and sediment from different sources. In this study suspended sediment
   transport was studied in the River Rhine between Kaub and the
   German-Dutch border. As concentrations decrease over a runoff season and
   as the relationship between water discharge and suspended sediment
   concentrations during most floods is characterized by clockwise
   hysteresis, it is concluded that sediment depletion occurs during a
   hydrological year and during individual floods. However, analyses of the
   sediment contribution from the River Mosel indicate thar clockwise
   hysteresis may result from sediment depletion as well as from early
   sediment supply from a tributary. Thus, although the suspended sediment
   behaviour in the downstream part of the River Rhine is partly a
   transport phenomenon related to energy conditions, mixing and routing of
   water from different sources also plays an important role.
   Suspended sediment transport during floods was modelled using a
   `supply-based' model. Addition of a sediment supply term to the sediment
   rating curve leads to a model that produces better estimates of
   instantaneous suspended sediment concentrations during high discharge
   events. A major constriction of the model is that it cannot be used to
   predict suspended sediment concentrations as long as the amount of
   sediment in storage and the timing of sediment supply are unknown.

Abstract = {{The broad purpose of the study described here was to assess the role of
   denitrification in riparian zones in ameliorating groundwater pollution
   through nitrate loss, and as a potential source of nitrous oxide to the
   atmosphere. A suitable riparian zone was identified at Cuddesdon Mill on
   the River Thame floodplain near Oxford, England. Measurements were made
   of water and nitrate moving from arable land through the riparian zone
   and into the river. Techniques to measure denitrification were tested
   and applied, and the factors controlling denitrification measured. While
   there was considerable potential for denitrification at the site, this
   was not realized because much of the water moving off the farmland
   bypassed the riparian zone, entering the river directly via springs or
   through gravel lenses beneath the floodplain soil. Management of this
   site would not reduce nitrate leaching unless the floodplain hydrology
   could be substantially modified, and the main conclusion is that nitrate
   buffer zones will only operate efficiently where the hydrology of the
   site is appropriate. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Major solute concentrations in overland flow water (OFW) were measured
   in an agricultural field of Brittany (western France). Two storm events
   were monitored in detail to examine the short time-scale processes.
   During one year, samples were taken at different positions on the slope
   after each storm event to describe the spatial and seasonal variations
   of OFW chemistry. Although the total dissolved load in OFW is not much
   higher than in rain water, distinctive features are observed. K+, Ca2+,
   NH4, Cl- and SO42- are the major solutes. The main origin of the
   elements (sea salts, exchangeable soil complex or fertilizers)
   determined most of the variations observed. Spatial variations along the
   slope are mainly seen for exchangeable cations, while seasonal
   variations are predominant for sea salts. Rainfall intensity and
   suspended sediment load induce strong differences between the two storm
   events studied in detail. However, the within-storm variations and the
   seasonal monitoring show that this relationship is complex. Within-storm
   variations suggest that, in addition to desorption processes, mixing
   with pre-event water may occur. The lack of a relationship between
   sediment load and dissolved load is attributed to the high rate of the
   exchange processes, which has been checked by a simple experiment in
   vitro. It is concluded that the conditions of the transit of water on
   the field (velocity, length, status of the surface, crusted or not) may
   well play a major role in the chemical changes between rain water and
   OFW. The results suggest that vegetated buffer strips designed to reduce
   the sediment load only, and not the amount of overland flow, will have
   little effect on the transfer of dissolved pollutants to the
   watercourses. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The characteristics of the groundwater cycle were researched using
   stable isotope technology in western Sri Lanka where climatic conditions
   change greatly within a relatively short distance. The effects of local
   climate, surface water and topography on the groundwater cycle in the
   study area with similar geological conditions were investigated. Sri
   Lanka can be divided spatially into a dry zone, an intermediate zone and
   a wet zone, and also temporally into the rainy season and the dry
   season. The zonal characteristics of the groundwater cycle were also
   elucidated using stable isotopic technology.
   As an input delta diagram of precipitation in the study area, there are
   obvious seasonal changes in the isotopic composition and a magnitude
   effect, both in the wet, zone and dry zone. In the wet zone, the slope
   of the regression line between delta D and delta O-18 and deuterium
   excess is close to 8 and 10, respectively. However, in the dry zone, the
   slope of the regression line between delta D and delta O-18 and
   deuterium excess is much less than 8 and 10, respectively.
   In the wet zone, there is an obvious seasonal change in the isotopic
   composition of groundwater. The groundwater was recharged by
   precipitation during the whole year. The isotopically lighter
   groundwater was found at the valley bottom in the rainy season there.
   Under the very heavy precipitation conditions, the slope of the
   regression line between delta D and delta O-18 and deuterium excess for
   groundwater was close to 8 and 10, respectively. In other cases, the
   slopes of the regression lilies are less than 8. In the dry zone, the
   groundwater was recharged by precipitation only in the rainy season. The
   isotopically lighter groundwater was found on the ridge of the valley in
   the rainy season. The slope of the regression line between delta D and
   delta O-18 and deuterium excess for groundwater was much less than 8 and
   10, respectively. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty conservative tracer injections were carried, out in the same
   reach of a small woodland stream in order to determine how variation in
   discharge and leaf accumulation affect stream hydraulic parameters. The
   injections were made at various discharge rates ranging from 2.6 to 40
   l/s. Five of the injections were made during late autumn, when there
   were large accumulations of leaves in the stream. Estimates of hydraulic
   parameters were made by fitting a transient storage solute transport
   model to conservative tracer concentration profiles. Velocity increased
   almost linearly with increasing discharge, indicating a decline in the
   Darcy friction factor. Dispersion also increased with increasing
   discharge, especially for the lower flow injections. The relative size
   of the storage zone was small (similar to 0.1). There was no definable
   relationship between discharge and the relative storage zone size, but
   the rates of exchange between the storage zone and the main channel
   increased markedly with increasing discharge. The presence of large
   accumulations of leaves had a clear effect on the hydraulic
   characteristics of the stream, producing much higher friction factors,
   larger storage zone sizes and lower velocity than would have been
   predicted by discharge alone. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Spatio-temporal variations in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in
   groundwater were analysed and related to the variations in hydrological
   conditions, vegetation type and substrate in an alluvial ecosystem. This
   study was conducted in the Illwald forest in the Rhine Plain (eastern
   France) to assess the removal of nutrients from groundwater in a
   regularly flooded area. We compared both forest and meadow ecosystems on
   clayey-silty soils with an anoxic horizon (pseudogley) at 1.5-2 m depth
   (eutric gley soil) and a forest ecosystem on a clayey-silty fluviosoil
   rich in organic matter with a gley at 0.5 m depth (calcaric gley soil).
   Piezometers were used to measure the nutrient concentrations in the
   groundwater at 2 m depth in the root layer and at 4.5 m depth, below the
   root layer. Lower concentrations of nitrate and phosphate in groundwater
   were observed under forest than under meadow, which could be explained
   by more efficient plant uptake by woody species than herbaceous plants.
   Thus NO3-N inputs by river hoods were reduced by 73\% in the shallow
   groundwater of the forested ecosystem, and only by 37\% in the meadow.
   Compared with the superficial groundwater layer, the lowest level of
   nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) and the highest level of ammonium nitrogen
   (NH4-N) were measured in the deep layer (under the gley horizon at 2.5 m
   depth), which suggests that the reducing potential of the anoxic horizon
   in the gley soils contributes to the reduction of nitrate. Nitrate
   concentrations were higher in the groundwater of the parcel rich in
   organic matter than in the one poorer in organic matter. Phosphate
   (PO4-P) concentrations in both shallow and deep groundwater are less
   than 62 to 76\% of those found in surface water which can be related to
   the retention capacity of the clay colloids of these soils. Moreover,
   the temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in groundwater are
   directly related to variations in groundwater level during an annual
   hydrological cycle. Our results suggest that variations in groundwater
   level regulate spatio-temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in
   groundwater as a result of the oxidation-reduction status of soil, which
   creates favourable or unfavourable conditions for nutrient
   bioavailability. The hydrological variations are much more important
   than those concerning substrate and type of vegetation. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Seasonal and event variations in stream channel area and the
   contributions of channel precipitation to stream flow were studied on a
   106-ha forested headwater catchment in central Pennsylvania. Variations
   in stream velocity, flowing stream surface width and widths of
   near-stream saturated areas were periodically monitored at 61 channel
   transects over a two-year period. The area of flowing stream surface and
   near-stream saturated zones combined, ranged from 0.07\% of basin area
   during summer low flows to 0.60\% of total basin area during peak storm
   flows. Near-stream saturated zones generally represented about half of
   the total channel area available to intercept throughfall and generate
   channel precipitation. Contributions of routed channel precipitation
   from the flowing stream surface and near-stream zones, calculated using
   the Penn State Runoff Model (PSRM, v. 95), represented from 1.1 to 6.4\%
   of total stream flow and 2.5-29\% of total storm flow (stream
   flow-antecedent baseflow) during the six events. Areas of near-stream
   saturated zones contributed 35-52\% of the computed channel
   precipitation during the six events, Channel precipitation contributed a
   higher percentage of stream flow for events with low antecedent baseflow
   when storm flow generated by subsurface sources was relatively low.
   Expansion of channel area and consequent increases in volumes of channel
   precipitation with flow increases during events was non-linear, with
   greater rates of change occurring at lower than at higher discharge
   rates. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the sensitivity of calibration of hydrological
   model parameters to different objective functions. Several functions are
   defined with weights depending upon the hydrological background. These
   are compared with an objective function based upon kriging, Calibration
   is applied to piezometric readings from the Isle of Goeree in the
   Netherlands. For a study on the permeability of the first aquifer, the
   kriging predictor yields weights that differ from using prior knowledge,
   and emphasizes more strongly spatially isolated points than commonly
   applied objective functions. It reduces the range of differences between
   measurements and model simulations, but the mean absolute error
   increases. For a study on the resistance of the top layer and of the
   aquitard, use of prior information in the objective functions leads to a
   reduction in standard deviations of the differences between measured and
   calculated values by 40-80\%, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Between 1990 and 1995 a series of bed sediment, suspended sediment and
   fresh floodplain samples were collected within the Seine River Basin, in
   France, to evaluate variations in trace element geochemistry. Average
   background trace element levels for the basin were determined from the
   collection and subsequent analyses of bed sediment samples from small
   rural watersheds and from a prehistoric (5000 BP) site in Paris.
   Concentrations are relatively lon, and similar to those observed for
   line-grained bed sediments from unaffected areas in the United States
   and Canada. However, the concentrations are somewhat higher than the
   reference levels presently adopted by French water authorities for areas
   north of the Seine Basin, which have similar bedrock lithologies.
   Downstream trace element variations were monitored in 1994 and 1995
   using fresh surficial floodplain samples that were collected either as
   dried deposits a few days after peak discharge, or immediately after
   peak discharge (under less than or equal to 30 cm of water). Chemical
   comparisons between fresh floodplain deposits, and actual suspended
   sediments collected during flood events, indicate that, with some
   caveats, the former can be used as surrogates for the latter. The
   floodplain sediment chemical data indicate that within the Seine Basin,
   from the relatively unaffected headwaters through heavily affected urban
   streams, trace element concentrations vary by as much as three orders of
   magnitude. These trace element changes appear to be the result of both
   increases in population as well as concomitant increases in industrial
   activity. This article is a US government work and is in the public
   domain in the United States.}},

Abstract = {{Fine-scale dynamics of groundwater flow were studied in a 1.5 ha
   peatland in central New York. Measurements of the hydraulic head
   throughout a detailed network of piezometer clusters revealed spatial
   and temporal variability in the direction of groundwater flow at a very
   fine (within a few metres) scale of analysis. Within the small wetland,
   there were areas of groundwater recharge, discharge and lateral flow.
   Such patterns of ground water flow frequently reversed or changed due to
   fluctuations of only a few centimetres in hydraulic head. Specific
   conductance, deuterium signatures and calcium concentrations of
   groundwater corroborated the groundwater flow patterns determined with
   hydraulic head measurements and illustrated the influence of source
   water chemistry and evaporation on different layers in the peat column.
   The control of pear chemistry by such fine-scale groundwater flow may
   have important implications for plant community composition and
   diversity in groundwater-fed peatlands. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This study analyses archival discharge and sediment concentration data
   (1965-1988), monitored by Water Survey of Canada, to examine suspended
   sediment transport rates and their relationship to effective discharge
   (Q(eff)) based on daily discharge duration curves. Effective discharge
   was determined as the mid-point of the discharge class transporting the
   greatest portion of the suspended sediment load (hence class-based
   Q(eff)). Results showed that the concept of effective discharge was
   applicable to the Fraser River basin where the average class-based
   Q(eff) occurred during 8.4\% of the study period with individual values
   ranging from 0.03\% to 16.1\%. The durations of effective discharge
   classes ranged from 0.02\% to 19.6\% while the transport of 50\% of
   total sediment loads ranged from 3\% to 22\% with an average of 14\% of
   the time. Equations for predicting the class-based Q(eff) in the Fraser
   River basin from bankfull discharge and drainage area are presented. The
   observed variations among stations in sediment-discharge regimes based
   on subjectively selected 20 discharge classes, seem to reflect the
   influence of sediment controlling factors such as geology, physiography.
   catchment size and land use practice in the basin. Future directions of
   research on applications of the effective discharge concept are
   explored. As a solution to the problem of lack of an objective method
   for determining the effective discharge, the effective discharge should
   be determined from event based assessments of sediment transport
   (event-based Q(eff)), avoiding any subjectivity in the selection of
   number of discharge classes used for its determination. In conclusion,
   it is proposed that continued use of the conventional method of
   determining Q(eff) should cease. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The groundwater regime in the north-western part of the Visakhapatnam
   urban area was polluted as early as 1981 by discharge of untreated
   industrial effluent from a Hindustan Polymers Limited (HPL) plant. A
   total dissolved solids (TDS) concentration of surficial effluent up to
   6500 mg/l and of groundwater in the range 3000-4200 mg/l has been
   reported in the environs of the HPL plant during May 1992. Groundwater
   occurs under water table conditions. The groundwater flow model was
   simulated as a single layer aquifer, using MODFLOW and FLOWPATH computer
   models. Aquifer parameters were estimated and the value of effective
   porosity assumed. The water table configuration was mapped in May 1981
   using 33 observation wells. The calibrated hydraulic head distribution
   was used to compute the velocity field using the effective porosity
   values. The flow paths of groundwater migration from the source
   locations up to 2002 AD were predicted. Pathlines of particles in the
   groundwater indicated a predominant north-east and south-west migration
   of groundwater pollution in the area. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

   frequencies. this anisotropy supports a pronounced lateral component of
   hillslope flow paths. and also of overland flow under pasture. Our
   results are at variance with data from other latosols where K-sat tends

Abstract = {{Observations from the US Environmental Protection Agency's Episodic
   Response Project (ERP) in the Northeastern United States are used to
   develop an empirical/mechanistic scheme for prediction of the minimum
   values of acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) during episodes. An
   acidification episode is defined as a hydrological event during which
   ANC decreases. The pre-episode ANC is used to index the antecedent
   condition, and the stream flow increase reflects how much the relative
   contributions of sources of waters change during the episode. As much as
   92\% of the total variation in the minimum ANC in individual catchments
   can be explained (with levels of explanation >70\% far nine of the 13
   streams) by a multiple linear regression model that includes pre-episode
   ANC and change in discharge as independent variables. The predictive
   scheme is demonstrated to be regionally robust, with the regional
   variance explained ranging from 77 to 83\%. The scheme is not successful
   for each ERP stream, and reasons are suggested for the individual
   failures. The potential for applying the predictive scheme to other
   watersheds is demonstrated by testing the model with data from the
   Panola Mountain Research Watershed in the South-eastern United States,
   where the variance explained by the model was 74\%. The model can also
   be utilized to assess `chemically new' and `chemically old' water
   sources during acidification episodes. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The upper reaches of the Huai River in Central China are located in the
   East Asian monsoon region. Strong seasonality, as well as large
   interannual variability of rainfall, causes floods and an uneven supply
   of water. In order to conserve the water and mitigate the floods, darns
   and flood protection structures are constructed. Their design requires
   information about the rainfall. Daily observations from 1957 to 1986
   from 78 rain gauges were used to study shape, orientation, movement and
   geographical and seasonal occurrence of storms in the 79 000 km(2) study
   area. The rainfall characteristics were described using graphical plots,
   cross- arid autocorrelation. Storms larger than 50 mm/day were found to
   occur from February to November, whereas storms exceeding 350 mm/day
   were confmed to the main rainfall season from late June to mid-August.
   The southern part of the study area experienced a break in the rainfall
   season in late July, corresponding to the seasonal northward shift of
   the rain belt. A weekly periodicity of 7-8 days for rainfall was found
   during June-July, but not during August-September. During the whole
   period June-September, the spatial pattern of daily rainfall revealed an
   elongated shape, more pronounced during June-July than August-September.
   The rainfall area was orientated approximately from WSW to ENE during
   the whole period, and showed an anticlockwise rotation of about 16
   degrees per day during June-July. The cross-correlation analysis
   revealed that the rainfall area moved about 100 km/day eastward. These
   results and an investigation of meteorological maps indicate that the
   spatial correlation pattern of daily rainfall is produced by cold fronts
   on the Mei-Yu front. Suggestions are made as to how to use the results
   for the construction of design rainfalls in the study area. Copyright

Pages = {{1217-1232}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus sorption studies were carried out on particle size fractions
   of soils collected from the walls of gullies through a granitic and a
   sedimentary soil, as well as on particle size classes derived from
   breakage and abrasion of the 500 to 1400 mu m components of these soils.
   Sorption of phosphorus by the particle size classes of the sedimentary
   soil was much greater than those of the granite soil, and this also
   applied to the particles derived from breakage and abrasion.
   For the original sedimentary soil, sorption of phosphorus by the
   particle size components was strongly associated with the iron content
   and less strongly associated with the aluminium content and this also
   applied to the particles derived from breakage and abrasion. For the
   granitic soil these relationships were much less precise.
   A period of vigorous mixing, after 165 hours of gentle mixing, caused
   release of a proportion of the sorbed phosphorus from all particle sizes
   of the original granitic soil and for most of the breakage/abrasion
   derived particles. The released phosphorus was re-sorbed during a
   subsequent 48 hour period of settling.
   Relationships were evident between labile P and sorbed P for the
   particle size classes of the soils and treatments tested.
   Because particle size, lithology of the transported sediments and flow
   dynamics affect the distribution of phosphorus between water and
   sediments, they can also be expected to effect bio-availability of
   phosphorus. Particle breakage and abrasion during sediment transport is
   another factor likely to influence the bioavailability of P. Copyright

Abstract = {{Although rewetting practices have been implemented in several cutover
   raised bogs, their effects on discharge patterns have not received much
   attention. In 1983, after peat extraction had stopped in the Leegmoor, a
   cutover raised bog in Germany, an experimental area was set up in order
   to monitor rewetting and subsequent restoration. Discharge was measured
   since 1984. The results suggest that rewetted raised bogs may not be
   effective as regulators of stream flow. An increase of low flows during
   a decade of rewetting could partly be attributed to weather variation. A
   comparison of the Leegmoor with a nearby control catchment produced
   similar results. A shift in the relationship between discharge and
   groundwater level over time was recorded. This is probably a result of
   the development of vegetation and a corresponding reduction of the area
   of open water, leading to an increase of resistance to water flow. The
   Leegmoor data demonstrate that the daily discharge pattern is most
   flashy immediately after the start of rewetting and will gradually
   smooth. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a semi-distributed
   parallel surface rainfall-runoff conceptual model. In this paper, a
   general solution of the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) has been
   derived successfully for N linearly connected reservoirs, each having a
   different storage constant. The solution is a function of geomorphologic
   parameters, meteorologic factors and roughness coefficients. The model
   also takes into account the hydrologic response which is influenced by
   outflow downstream of a reservoir. For calibration, the shuffled complex
   evolution (SCE) algorithm is used to search for the global optimal
   parameters of the model. Because of the parallel structure, the mean
   roughness parameter of the channel becomes a ``conceptual{''} parameter
   without a real physical meaning. To evaluate the adaptability of the
   model adopted, three watersheds around the city of Taipei in Taiwan were
   chosen to test the effectiveness of the model. The study provides an
   appropriate rainfall-runoff model for planning flood mitigation in
   Taiwan. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A simple algorithm for generating streamflow networks for macroscale
   hydrological models (MHMs) from digital elevation models (DEMs) is
   presented. Typically these hydrological models are grid based, with the
   simulated runoff produced within each cell routed through a stream
   network which connects the centers of cells in the direction of the
   major streams. Construction of such stream networks is a time consuming
   task, which has generally been done by hand with the aid of maps.
   Results indicate that the algorithm works satisfactorily in areas of
   both high and low relief, and for a wide range of model cell
   resolutions, although some manual adjustments may be necessary.

Abstract = {{There is increasing debate these days on climate change and its possible
   consequences. Much of this debate has focused in the context of surface
   water systems. In many arid areas of the world, rainfall is scarce and
   so is surface runoff. These areas rely heavily on groundwater. The
   consequences of climate change on groundwater are long term and can be
   far reaching, One of the more apparent consequences is the increased
   migration of salt water inland in coastal aquifers. Using two coastal
   aquifers, one in Egypt and the other in India, this study investigates
   the effect of likely climate change on sea water intrusion. Three
   realistic scenarios mimicking climate change are considered. Under these
   scenarios, the Nile Delta aquifer is found to be more vulnerable to
   climate change and sea level rise. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The relationship between stream water DOC concentrations and soil
   organic C pools was investigated at a range of spatial scales in
   subcatchments of the River Dee system in north-east Scotland. Catchment
   percentage peat cover and soil C pools, calculated using local, national
   and international soils databases, were related to mean DOC
   concentrations in streams draining small- (<5 km(2)), medium- (12-38
   km(2)) and large-scale (56-150 km(2)) catchments. The results show that,
   whilst soil C pool is a good predictor of stream water DOC concentration
   at all three scales, the strongest relationships were found in the
   small-scale catchments. In addition, in both the small- and large-scale
   catchments, percentage peat cover was as a good predictor of stream
   water DOC concentration as catchment soil C pool. The data also showed
   that, for a given soil C pool, streams draining lowland (< 700 m)
   catchments had higher DOC concentrations than those draining upland (>
   700 m) catchments, suggesting that disturbance and land use may have a
   small effect on DOC concentration. Our results therefore suggest that
   the relationship between stream water DOC concentration and catchment
   soil C pools exists at a range of spatial scales and this relationship
   appears to be sufficiently robust to be used to predict the effects of
   changes in catchment soil C storage on stream water DOC concentration.

Abstract = {{A major Land-Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) was launched by the UK
   Natural Environmental Research Council in 1992 as a Community Research
   Programme. The six-year programme, which was completed in 1998, aimed to
   estimate contemporary fluxes into and out of the coastal zone, to
   characterize the key physical and biogeochemical processes involved, to
   describe the longer term evolution of coastal systems and to develop
   coupled land-ocean models. The rivers component of the LOIS study
   focused on the Yorkshire Ouse and the other principal rivers draining to
   the Humber Estuary, and on the River Tweed. Most effort was directed to
   the Yorkshire Ouse. The river research programme emphasized sediment,
   water quality and biological investigations. In view of the general lack
   of information on suspended sediment transport by British rivers,
   particular attention was placed on investigating the suspended sediment
   dynamics of the study rivers and their tidal reaches and interactions
   between fine sediment and nutrients and contaminants. The 14 papers
   contained in this special issue report various aspects of these sediment
   studies, including several linked to the longer term behaviour of the
   river systems involved. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive sediment monitoring network was established within the LOIS
   programme, involving 10 of the main tributaries of the River Humber
   (UK). Its primary purpose was to measure the flux of suspended sediment
   to the estuary. A turbidity monitoring system was developed to provide a
   continuous record of suspended sediment concentration in the rivers,
   from which the fluxes were calculated. Linear relationships were
   established between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity (with
   slopes varying from 0.89 to 1.69) to enable the conversion of
   nephelometric turbidity {[}NTU] to suspended sediment concentration
   {[}mg l(-1)]. Potential uncertainties were identified and quantified.
   The suspended sediment flux to the Humber (November 1994-October 1997)
   was calculated to be 699 861 t, equivalent to a yield of 15 t km(-2)
   yr(-1). Large temporal and spatial variations in the flux were measured
   during the monitoring period, in response to factors such as climate,
   land use, catchment scale, deposition and reservoir trapment. The
   particle size composition of the suspended sediment was measured and
   found to vary little, except at very high discharges, when it coarsened.
   The organic content of the sediment was found to be directly related to
   the discharge of sewage effluent to the rivers. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Statistically verified composite fingerprints and a multivariate mixing
   model have been employed to establish the main sources of the suspended
   sediment transported through the lower, non-tidal reaches of the River
   Ouse and one of its main tributaries, the River Wharfe, during the
   period 1994-1997. In the case of the suspended sediment samples
   collected from the River Ouse, the load-weighted mean contributions from
   uncultivated topsoil, cultivated topsoil and channel bank sources were
   estimated to be c. 25, 38 and 37\%, respectively, while for the River
   Wharfe these sources contributed c. 70, 4 and 23\%, respectively (c. 4\%
   was derived from woodland topsoil). Suspended sediment samples collected
   during higher flows evidenced a greater contribution from channel banks
   than samples collected during lower flows. Source materials were also
   differentiated according to the three main geological source areas
   (Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic, and Jurassic) and their
   load-weighted mean contributions were estimated to be c. 24, 41 and 35\%
   for the River Ouse and c. 91, 9 and 0\% (there are no Jurassic rocks in
   this catchment) for the River Wharfe, respectively. When suspended
   sediment samples from tributary streams were used to characterize each
   geological source area, the equivalent results for the River Ouse were
   c. 30, 46 and 24\%. Considering the three main tributaries that
   contribute to the River Ouse, the load-weighted mean contributions from
   the rivers Swale, Ure and Nidd were estimated to be 82, 15 and 3\%,
   respectively. These values have been compared with estimates of the
   relative magnitude of the annual suspended sediment loads of these three
   rivers for the years 1995 and 1996 derived from continuous monitoring of
   discharge and turbidity. Differences between the two sets of results are
   ascribed to the different periods of record involved and to the timing
   of suspended sediment sampling relative to the overall storm hydrograph,
   and thus the degree to which the available samples are representative of
   the overall suspended sediment flux. Although a number of limitations
   must be recognized, the fingerprinting approach to source ascription is
   seen as providing valuable information regarding suspended sediment
   sources in the study catchments. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Few studies have considered downstream changes in bank erosion rates and
   variability along single river systems. This paper reports some
   preliminary results of an intensive and direct field monitoring exercise
   of bank erosion rates on 11 sites along 130 km of the 3315 km(2)
   Swale-Ouse river system in northern England over a 14.5 month period.
   Data were collected at active sites using grid networks of erosion pins
   read at c. 18-30 day intervals and bank-line resurveys. Erosion rates
   were relatively high for a river of this scale: spatially averaged bank
   erosion magnitudes over the 14.5 months varied from 82.7 mm to 440.1 mm,
   although at one highly mobile reach retreat of 1760 mm was recorded over
   4 months. Bank erosion rates tended to peak in mid-basin, possibly
   because of an optimum combination there of high stream powers and
   erodible bank materials, as predicted theoretically by Lawler (1992,
   1995). The piedmont (upland-lowland transition) zone was especially
   active. Graphical erosion representations for specific periods, however,
   showed that bank retreat was often highly localized within individual
   sites. Strong seasonal variations in erosion rate were also observed
   with a significant winter (December-March) peak. A novel finding,
   however, was the apparent downstream increase in the length of the
   erosion `season', with measurable retreat occurring at the lower sites
   from September to July. This is interpreted as a reflection of a richer
   mix of bank erosion processes at the downstream sites, where mass
   failure, fluid entrainment and weathering processes are all active, with
   each process group having its own, but overlapping, temporal (seasonal)
   domain. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Rates of contemporary overbank sedimentation and sediment storage on the
   floodplains of the main channel systems of the Yorkshire Ouse and River
   Tweed, UK, have been investigated, so that the estimates of sediment
   flux obtained for these rivers within the framework of the LOIS
   Community Research Programme can be considered in relation to their
   overall suspended sediment budgets. Caesium-137 measurements have been
   used to establish the recent rates of accumulation of fine-grained
   overbank sediment deposits associated with sediment cores collected from
   a series of transects across the floodplains of the study rivers.
   Average annual sedimentation rates over the past 30-40 years estimated
   for individual cores ranged from 0 to c. 1.60 g cm(-2) yr(-1) in the
   Ouse Basin and from 0 to c. 0.70 g cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Tweed Basin. In
   general, highest accumulation rates occur closest to the channel and
   values decrease with increasing distance from the channel, although for
   some transects very low accumulation rates also occur near the channel.
   Average overbank sedimentation rates for individual transects ranged
   from 0.010 to 0.554 g cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Ouse Basin and from 0.016 to
   0.218 g cm(-2) yr(-1) in the Tweed Basin, with the mean for all
   transects being 0.206 and 0.129 g cm(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The total
   annual storage of fine-grained sediment on the floodplains bordering the
   main channel systems of the study rivers have been estimated by
   extrapolating the sedimentation rates derived for the individual
   transects to the adjacent floodplain reaches and calculating the total
   mass of sediment deposited upstream of the tidal limits. The resulting
   values are 70 970 t for the River Ouse (including the River Wharfe)
   system and 43 920 t for the River Tweed. These values of floodplain
   storage have been compared with the annual suspended sediment loads at
   downstream gauging sites for 1995 and 1996 provided by the LOIS Core
   Monitoring Programme for the River Ouse and estimated from Harmonized
   Monitoring Programme data for the River Tweed. This comparison indicates
   that 39 and 40\% of the total suspended sediment delivered to the main
   channel systems of the rivers Ouse (to Skelton) and Tweed (to Norham),
   respectively, is deposited and stored on their floodplains. For the
   River Wharfe, the conveyance loss is c. 50\%, and this higher value is
   thought to reflect the low sediment loads recorded for 1995 and 1996,
   which are likely to underestimate the longer term average values with
   which the estimates of sediment storage should be compared. The results
   obtained have important implications for the interpretation of
   downstream suspended sediment fluxes in the study rivers in terms of
   sediment mobilization and transfer within the upstream drainage basin.

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analysis of available data on suspended sediment
   concentrations in rivers within the Yorkshire region. It identifies the
   main control on the mean suspended sediment concentration across 62
   medium-sized catchments (5-380 km(2)) to be that of land cover/use, with
   the percentage of cropped and suburban/urban land accounting for 71.5\%
   of the variation between catchments. Twenty-two of the sites have
   associated flow gauging, and analysis of this reveals a strong flow
   dependence for catchments with a high percentage of arable land. In the
   case of urbanized catchments, there is considerable scatter owing to the
   influence of point source inputs: notably sewage effluent, combined
   sewer overflows, drainage from colliery waste and mine waters. This
   scatter is due not only to the inherent variability within these point
   sources, which is not flow related, but also to the variable degree of
   dilution by flow in the main stream. As a first-order approximation, a
   simple regression model, in which sediment concentration is a function
   of the daily mean flow and the percentage of cropped and suburban/urban
   land cover can be used to generate daily time-series of sediment
   concentration. This model has been applied within the LOIS catchment
   delivery model and performs well across a wide range of catchment types.
   Results are presented for four catchments representative of the
   Yorkshire region. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A central objective of the LOIS Community Research Programme is to
   provide estimates of the land-ocean flux of suspended sediment from the
   LOIS study area. While high frequency (15-minute interval) suspended
   sediment concentration data are recorded within the programme at six
   tidal limit sites, infrequent (weekly-monthly) sampling undertaken by
   the Harmonized Monitoring (HM) Programme provides additional
   concentration data for 23 tidal limit sites in the LOIS study area. In
   order that these infrequent data can be used to generate sediment flux
   estimates, the accuracy and precision of 22 load estimation procedures
   are assessed in the context of sampling frequency (weekly, fortnightly
   and monthly) and basin scales representative of the LOIS study area.
   Sampling frequency is demonstrated to exert a significant influence on
   the precision of the individual procedures, with precision being
   inversely related to sampling frequency. Accuracy is less clearly
   influenced by sampling frequency, although different procedures were
   identified as being the most accurate at the three sampling frequencies.
   Basin scale is shown to exert a significant influence upon accuracy and
   precision, with the performance of the load estimation procedures being
   inversely related to basin scale. For one interpolation procedure, an
   error correction procedure is developed, based on the strong
   relationship identified in this study between the error associated with
   individual flux estimates and the ratio of mean sampled discharge to the
   mean discharge obtained from the high frequency record. This relatively
   high resolution error correction method is applied to HM data from eight
   tidal limit sites in the LOIS area, and corrects the initial annual load
   estimates to provide values that are considered to be more
   representative of rivers from the LOIS study area. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{This study attempts to establish causes of historical variations in
   flood frequency and magnitude in a 119-year flood stage record at York,
   and assess its likely effects on fluxes of fine sediment and associated
   base metal contaminants. Climatic controls of flooding are evaluated
   through analysis of synoptic flood generation, and large-scale land use
   changes are also considered in terms of their influence on food
   frequency and magnitude and sediment availability, The late nineteenth
   century was characterized by low flood frequency and magnitude, but, as
   a consequence of upland metal mining, contaminant concentrations and
   downstream fine sediment delivery would have been high. A further
   decline in flood frequency and magnitude between 1904 and 1943, combined
   with the cessation of base metal mining, resulted in a decline of
   sediment and contaminant fluxes. Between 1944 and 1968 increases in
   upland drainage, changes in agricultural practices and high flood
   frequency and magnitude resulted in significantly enhanced sediment
   fluxes. Rates of flux declined between 1969 and 1977 owing to extremely
   low flood frequencies and magnitudes. In the last two decades there have
   been a series of extreme magnitude floods, which through remobilization
   of mining-contaminated alluvium have resulted in high pollutant metal
   mining loads, probably approaching those of the late nineteenth century.
   In an historical context it appears that the LOIS monitoring programme
   has been undertaken in a period of extremely high flood frequency and
   magnitude in the UK, and significantly enhanced sediment and contaminant
   metal flux. Analysis of synoptic flood generation suggests that any
   future increase in the frequency and vigour of cyclonic atmospheric
   circulations may result in a higher frequency of extreme floods and
   consequently increased sediment fluxes. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Bottom sediments from a single core retrieved from nine lakes and/or
   reservoir sites have been analysed for particle size, loss on ignition
   and the total concentration of Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Al, Mn and P. Site
   differences reflect the relative significance of autochthonous and
   allochthonous contributions to the sedimentary record and are related to
   changes in sedimentation rate through time as determined from a (210)Pb
   and (137)Cs chronology determined for each core. Whilst changing
   sedimentation rates reflect both sediment influx from the contributing
   catchment and focusing within the lake basin, the patterns generally
   reveal changes associated with catchment disturbance over the last
   century. Calcium-rich sediments are found in two lakes draining
   catchments underlain by Oolitic limestones. Organic matter contents, as
   determined by low temperature loss on ignition, range from 13 to 25\%.
   High organic matter levels are found in bottom sediments either where
   the contributing catchment has extensive blanket peat accumulations or
   in lakes with low sediment accumulation rates, where the organic matter
   content is more likely to be controlled by lake productivity. In
   general, organic matter content is inversely related to sedimentation
   rate and to sediment yield. Greatest down-core variations in sediment
   physical and geochemical signatures are found in lake sediment records
   where catchments have experienced significant increases in sediment
   influx from the catchment. The average sediment yield determined for
   each of the nine lake-catchments is inversely related to average organic
   matter and P content of the sediments, but an increase in sediment yield
   is associated with better sorting and a decrease in the proportion of
   coarse and medium silt sized particles. Six of the nine sites show
   evidence for significant increases in the total P load in their
   near-surface sediments, either resulting from higher than average
   sediment yields or as a result of significant increases in sediment-P
   concentrations. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Floodplain overbank sediments are often used to evaluate the influence
   of environmental change on sediment and chemical fluxes within river
   basins. This paper presents the results of an investigation of heavy
   metal storage in seven floodplain reaches in the Yorkshire Ouse basin in
   north-east England. Floodplain heavy metal storage has been greatest
   since c. 1750, and many of the post-1750 sedimentary units exhibit heavy
   metal values that exceed recommended trigger and guideline values for
   contaminated land. Relatively high heavy metal storage occurs from AD
   1250-1750 in most of the reaches. These patterns are related to 2000
   years of Pb and Zn mining in the Yorkshire Dales and c. 250-300 years of
   industrial and urbanization activity around Leeds and Bradford, and
   increased delivery of fine-grained sediment during the last millennium,
   possibly owing to factors such as population growth and agricultural
   expansion during the Middle Ages, and climate change during the Little
   Ice Age. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The ultimate fate of inorganic phosphorus in natural waters is to a
   large degree determined by interactions with sediments. The interactions
   in river bed sediments have been investigated by a combination of
   methods using surface sediments, <2 mm in diameter, collected from a 55
   km stretch of the River Swale in Yorkshire, UK. The sediments were
   analysed by digestion (Fe, Ca and P), clay mineralogy and their
   equilibrium phosphate concentration. All the equilibrium phosphate
   concentrations were below 2 mu mol dm(-3), which is much less than the
   concentration in the overlying water and indicates a net uptake of
   phosphorus by the sediments. Experiments in a fluvarium channel with a
   coarse sediment also showed that the release and uptake of soluble
   phosphorus was towards a steady-state concentration in the overlying
   solution, consistent with measurements of the equilibrium phosphate
   concentration. A kinetic model describing the net uptake of soluble
   reactive phosphorus by river sediments was applied to chemical data
   collected during an intensive monitoring exercise in the catchment.

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Information on the distribution of acid-soluble Al, Ba, Co, Cr, Ni, Fe,
   Mn and Pb associated with suspended sediment is presented for the major
   Humber rivers draining into the North Sea. The data analysed are based
   on two major data sets: the Land-Ocean Interaction Study (LOIS) and
   Environment Agency (EA) regional monitoring programmes. Trace metal
   particulate concentrations show a large variation over space and time.
   Three types of pattern are observed. First, Ba and Pb are highly and
   linearly correlated and they have an order of magnitude higher
   concentrations to the north of the region owing to localized bedrock
   mineralization, historic mining activity and the associated
   contamination of floodplain areas during the 18th and 19th centuries
   (type 1). Secondly, there are strong interelement relationships between
   Al, Co, Ni and Fe (and to a lesser extent Mn) and between these elements
   and suspended sediment concentrations (type 2) and the points for all
   the rivers lie on the same straight line. For type 2 elements,
   concentrations are enriched by a factor of three within the industrially
   affected rivers in the central and southern parts of the area: the rural
   Swale in the north of the area also has enhanced concentrations of type
   2 elements in relation to higher suspended sediment concentrations.
   Thirdly, chromium shows about a thirty-fold enrichment in the industrial
   rivers (type 3). The relationships between all the trace metals are
   represented by a simple three-component mixing scheme involving natural
   background materials, industrially generated particulates and
   resuspended floodplain sediments contaminated by historic mining
   activity.
   The need for (a) focused studies to identify and describe key type
   localities for specific industrial and urban pollution sources and (b)
   further exploration of the wealth of information contained within the EA
   database, is highlighted. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   the last century: a paleolimnological approach}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the methods used to reconstruct suspended sediment
   yields over the last century, based on (210)Pb and (137)Cs dated bottom
   sediments in nine lake and/or reservoir catchments. Magnetic
   susceptibility and dry bulk density are used to correlate between
   multiple cores taken from each lake/reservoir basin in order to estimate
   sediment influx through time and reconstruct sediment yield histories.
   The catchments represent a range of morphological and land use systems,
   including upland moorland, upland forestry and upland and lowland
   agricultural systems. The reconstruction provides some background
   information on pre-20th century sediment yields and permits an
   evaluation of the effect of 20th century land management systems,
   especially upland afforestation and agriculture, on changing suspended
   sediment yields. Reconstructed sediment yields over the last century
   range from c. 7 to 86 t km(-2) yr(-1). Average post-1953 yields from
   pasture, arable, moor land and forested catchments are 13, 31, 29 and 13
   t km(-2) yr(-1), respectively. The history of human disturbance in
   individual catchments is clearly recorded in the reconstructed sediment
   yields. Short-lived disturbance, such as afforestation, produces high
   yields (over 40 t km(-2) yr(-1)) for up to a decade after planting, but
   yields subsequently decline to pre-planting levels (c. 12 t km(-2)
   yr(-1)). Sustained increases in sediment yield are associated with
   arable, mixed agricultural and, to a lesser extent, grazing systems.
   While the strong controls exerted on sediment yield by human disturbance
   mask the potential effect of regional contrasts in runoff and topography
   between catchments, there is some evidence to suggest that a long-term
   climate change signal is recorded in the temporal trends in sediment
   yield from an analysis of Lamb weather types. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Measurements using an automatic bank level monitoring technique {[}the
   photoelectronic erosion pin (PEEP) system] over a 70-day period between
   16 March and 27 May 1997 have revealed a complex pattern of erosion and
   deposition on an intertidal mudbank on the River Trent at Burringham.
   Comparison of mean daily changes in bank elevation at upper and lower
   bank positions suggest that wave activity induced by high wind speeds
   causes erosion, while high tidal range leads to deposition as a result
   of higher suspended solids concentrations. A greater variability in mean
   daily erosion and deposition events at the lower bank compared with the
   upper bank appears to indicate that higher bed shear stresses, as well
   as a greater availability of sediment for settling, owing to higher
   concentrations and a greater depth of water, lead to a more dynamic
   exchange of material at this position. The PEEP data also show longer
   term trends in sedimentation, with the mean deposition for the period
   exceeding mean erosion. Manual erosion pin measurements at a lower
   frequency over a longer, seven-month period confirm this, and also
   highlight the advantage of the PEEP system in monitoring events at a
   finer temporal resolution. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A strong turbidity maximum (TM) of suspended particulate matter (SPM)
   was observed in the upper Humber and lower Ouse during both spring and
   neap tides of May 1994. Near-bed concentrations within the TM sometimes
   exceeded fluid mud levels following slack water periods. SPM within the
   TM comprised very fine-grained material. Its low organic content
   demonstrated that the SPM was essentially mineral, elastic sediment.
   Generally, tidal advection of SPM was the dominant flux mechanism and
   the pronounced flood-ebb asymmetry in the tidal currents was reflected
   in these fluxes. However, the presence of fluid mud near the
   down-estuary margins of the TM on the early ebb resulted in a strong,
   up-estuary shear flux that opposed the ebb-directed advection. This
   mechanism therefore acted to maintain fine Sediment in the TM region.
   SPM concentrations in the inflowing fresh water at Naburn Weir were much
   less than those observed within the TM region (<300 mg l(-1) compared
   with >70 000 mg l(-1)). The estimated mean SPM transport into the tidal
   Ouse across Naburn Weir was about 4 kg s(-1) (>2 and <11 kg s(-1))
   during 1994. In the TM area, the SPM transported during the course of a
   single spring tide flood was roughly equivalent to 30 months of Naburn
   SPM inflows at average 1994 levels. The tidally averaged SPM transport
   in the TM region was directed into the estuary and, per tide, was
   roughly equivalent to three months of Naburn inputs. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Effective control of nonpoint source pollution from contaminants
   transported by runoff requires information about the source areas of
   surface runoff. Variable source hydrology is widely recognized by
   hydrologists, yet few methods exist for identifying the saturated areas
   that generate most runoff in humid regions. The Soil Moisture Routing
   model is a daily water balance model that simulates the hydrology for
   watersheds with shallow sloping soils. The model combines elevation,
   soil, and land use data within the geographic information system GRASS,
   and predicts the spatial distribution of soil moisture,
   evapotranspiration, saturation-excess overland flow (i.e., surface
   runoff), and interflow throughout a watershed. The model was applied to
   a 170 hectare watershed in the Catskills region of New York State and
   observed stream flow hydrographs and soil moisture measurements were
   compared to model predictions. Stream flow prediction during non-winter
   periods generally agreed with measured flow resulting in an average r(2)
   of 0.73, a standard error of 0.01 m(3)/s, and an average Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency R-2 of 0.62. Soil moisture predictions showed trends similar
   to observations with errors on the order of the standard error of
   measurements. The model results were most accurate for non-winter
   conditions. The model is currently used for making management decisions
   for reducing non-point source pollution from manure spread fields in the
   Catskill watersheds which supply New York City's drinking water.

Abstract = {{A method has been developed to simulate the long-term migration of
   radionuclides in the near-surface of a river catchment, following their
   release from a deep underground repository for radioactive waste.
   Previous (30-year) simulations, conducted using the SHETRAN physically
   based modelling system, showed that long-term (many decades) simulations
   are required to allow the system to reach steady state. Physically
   based, distributed models, such as SHETRAN, tend to be tao
   computationally expensive for this task. Traditional lumped
   catchment-scale models, on the other hand, do not give sufficiently
   detailed spatially distributed results. An intermediate approach to
   modelling has therefore been developed which allows flow and transport
   processes to be simulated with the spatial resolution normally
   associated with distributed models, whilst being computationally
   efficient.
   The approach involves constructing a lumped model in which the catchment
   is represented by a number of conceptual water storage compartments. The
   flow rates to and from these compartments are prescribed by functions
   that summarize the results from physically based distributed models run
   for a range of characteristic flow regimes. The physically based models
   used were, SHETRAN for the subsurface compartments, a particle tracking
   model for overland flow and an analytical model for channel routing. One
   important advantage of the method used in constructing the lumped model
   is that it makes down scaling possible, in the sense that fine-scale
   information on the distributed hydrological regime, as simulated by the
   physically based distributed models, can be inferred from the Variables
   in the lumped model that describe the hydrology at the catchment scale.
   A 250-year flow simulation has been run and the down scaling process
   used to infer a 250-year time-series of three-dimensional velocity
   fields for the subsurface of the catchment. This series was then used to
   drive a particle tracking simulation of contaminant migration. The
   concentration and spatial distribution of contaminants simulated by this
   model for the first 30 years were in close agreement with SHETRAN
   results. The remaining 220 years highlighted the fact that some of the
   most important transport pathways to the surface carry contaminants only
   very slowly so both the magnitude and spatial distribution of
   concentration in surface soils are not apparent over the shorter SHETRAN
   simulations. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the validity of CADISSE, a regional storage capacity model
   developed to assess the sensitivity of catchment hydrology to climate
   variability, is examined. In CADISSE, catchment discharge sensitivity is
   expressed as the ratio of present maximum reservoir storage to catchment
   storage capacity. Present maximum storage should be interpreted as the
   maximum amount of water stored in a catchment at present. Catchment
   storage capacity is defined as the absolute amount of water that can be
   stored, given the catchment's dimensions and lithological
   characteristics. With CADISSE, catchment sensitivity can be quantified
   regionally using limited discharge data and topographic information.
   Furthermore, storage capacities can be assessed. CADISSE was
   successfully applied to 15 catchments in the Upper Loire Basin. However,
   successful application does not necessarily mean that the variables
   (present maximum storage and storage capacity) represent real world
   values. Therefore, a two-step evaluation procedure is presented in this
   paper. To evaluate CADISSE, (1) the accurate assessment of regionally
   determined storage capacity, and (2) the importance of present maximum
   storage for catchment discharge sensitivity is examined with a daily
   discharge model by comparing observed and simulated catchment storage
   behaviour for dry and wet periods. The evaluation was carried out using
   the probability distributed daily discharge model, PDM, and a weather
   generator for three catchments with different storage capacities and
   storage behaviour. Results indicate that catchment storage capacity can
   be correctly quantified with CADISSE and that differences in storage
   behaviour are indeed important for analyses of catchment sensitivity.
   Hence, CADISSE has great potential as it can be used to identify flood-
   and drought-prone catchments under present and future conditions.

Abstract = {{Stream temperature ranged from 3 to 4 degrees C at an experimental site
   during snowmelt on Hokkaido Island, Japan, which provided direct
   evidence of major contributions of subsurface water to stream water. In
   contrast, stream temperatures during rainstorms in summer decreased
   gradually after stream flow peaked, attaining a nearly constant
   temperature ranging from 9 to 11 degrees C. During storm flow recession,
   stream temperatures during summer or snowmelt were similar to the soil
   temperature at 1.8 m below the land surface, suggesting that subsurface
   water contributions to stream flow are derived from this depth. The
   hygrographs during two rainstorms, August 1987 and September 1989, were
   separated using temperature. The stream temperature was assumed to
   depend on the mixing of surface flow, having a temperature ranging from
   that of rainfall to that of shallow (50 cm deep) soil water, and
   subsurface flow, having the temperature of the soil at 18 m below the
   land surface. Subsurface flow was estimated to contribute 85-90\% of the
   total stream flow during each rainstorm. A two-component hydrograph
   separation was also evaluated using specific conductance. Runoff
   contributions from the two sources for the temperature and specific
   conductance analysis were similar. Analysis of the temperature and
   conductance-discharge hysteresis loop, and of individual flow components
   for storm hygrographs, provide a general picture of the runoff process
   in the experimental basin. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Water sources and flow paths contributing to stream chemistry were
   evaluated in four Japanese forested watersheds with steep topography
   (slopes greater than or equal to 30 degrees). Stream chemistry during
   periods without rainfall and during events with less than 100 mm of
   precipitation was similar to seepage water chemistry, but markedly
   different from that of soil water which had higher concentrations of
   NO3- and Ca2+ and lower concentrations of Na+ and HCO3-. Also, stream
   Cl- concentrations in a Cl--treated watershed did not increase either
   during events with less than 100 mm of total rainfall or at baseflow
   conditions, even three years after the Cl- treatment. These results
   suggest that groundwater within bedrock fissures of Paleozoic strata had
   a long residence time and was a major contributor to steam water under
   baseflow conditions and even during small precipitation events (<100
   mm). In contrast, for large precipitation events (>100 mm), stream
   chemistry became more similar to soil water chemistry, especially within
   the steepest watershed. Also, for large precipitation events, stream Cl-
   concentrations in the Cl--treated watershed increased markedly. These
   results suggest that soil water was a major contributor to stream waters
   only during these large events. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The water level of five river stages and seven groundwater wells in the
   Taipei Basin were analysed by spectral analysis in the frequency domain.
   The diurnal, semi-diurnal and quarter-diurnal tidal components of the
   Tanshui River appear to relate closely to astronomical tides as K-1, M-2
   and M-4, respectively. It is also found that the diurnal component
   reveals a reversed phase angle in the middle section of the Tanshui
   River; the phase of the quarter-diurnal component is also found to be
   reversed at stations upstream in the Tanshui River and Hsintien Stream.
   It is believed that these phenomena could be caused by local variation
   in the river channel topography. The autospectrum and cross-spectrum
   between groundwater elevation and nearby river stage were observed to
   correlate highly with the frequency of the astronomical tides K-1, M-2
   and M-4. From the study of the phase shift and time lag of water level
   fluctuations at river stages and groundwater wells, it was found that
   the tidal effects of diurnal, semi-diurnal, and quarter-diurnal
   components were significantly different. The relationships between phase
   and the fluctuated range of atmospheric pressure and water level imply
   that change in atmospheric pressure does not affect water level
   fluctuation in the river stage and groundwater well. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Results are presented from a numerical simulation of three-dimensional
   flow hydraulics around a mid-channel bar carried out using the
   FLUENT/UNS computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package. FLUENT/
   UNS solves the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged form of the
   Navier-Stokes equations. Turbulence closure is achieved using a RNG
   k-epsilon model. Simulated flow velocities are compared with measured
   two-dimensional velocities (downstream and cross-stream) obtained using
   an electromagnetic current meter (ECM). The results of the simulation
   are qualitatively consistent with the flow structures observed in the
   field. Quantitative comparison of the simulated and measured velocity
   magnitudes indicates a strong positive correlation between the two (r =
   0.88) and a mean difference of 0.09 m s(-1). Deviations between
   simulated and measured velocities may be identified that are both random
   and systematic. The former may reflect a number of factors including
   subgrid-scale natural spatial variability in flow velocities associated
   with local bed structures and measurement uncertainty resulting from
   problems of ECM orientation. Model mesh configuration, roughness
   parameterization and inlet boundary condition uncertainty may each
   contribute to systematic differences between simulated and measured flow
   velocities. These results illustrate the potential for using CFD
   software to simulate flow hydraulics in natural channels with complex
   configurations. They also highlight the need for detailed spatially
   distributed datasets of three-dimensional flow variables to establish
   the accuracy and applicability of CFD software. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Detailed spatial patterns of soil moisture were measured for 13 dates at
   the 10.5 ha Tarrawarra catchment in southern Victoria, Australia.
   Several analyses of the data are summarized. These include: hydrological
   behaviour, including preferred states, spatial organization and the
   performance of terrain indices; geostatistical properties of the soil
   moisture patterns; and remote sensing of the soil moisture patterns. In
   the second part of the paper, the patterns along with surface runoff and
   meteorological data are used in applications of the Thales and VIC
   models at Tarrawarra. Thales is a process-based distributed parameter
   hydrological model which explicitly simulates the spatio-temporal
   patterns of soil moisture, while VIC uses a lumped statistical
   distribution approach to model the spatial variability of soil moisture
   storage. Both models simulate saturation excess runoff and are forced by
   rainfall and potential evapotranspiration. VIC was calibrated to
   observed runoff at the catchment outlet. Limited manual calibration of
   Thales to runoff and the soil moisture patterns was performed. Internal
   testing was achieved by comparison of predicted and observed spatial
   soil moisture patterns for the Thales model and of predicted and
   observed cumulative distributions of active soil moisture storage for
   the VIC model. With limited calibration effort, Thales was able to to
   simulate the seasonal changes in characteristics of the spatial soil
   moisture patterns. Detailed examination of the errors in the simulated
   patterns allowed identification of structural problems in the model,
   including problems with simulating lateral redistribution as the
   catchment wets in autumn. For the VIC model, time-series of spatially
   averaged internal state variables (total storage) were consistent with
   observations. However, the statistical distribution of soil moisture
   storage assumed in the model differed from that observed. The collection
   of detailed spatial data for soil moisture patterns provided a basis for
   testing the internal states relevant to each model formulation
   (spatially distributed for Thales and statistically lumped for VIC), as
   well as improving the identification of the dominant runoff processes.

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of an integrated
   saturated/unsaturated catchment model of salinity processes and its
   application to an irrigated and dryland district in northern Victoria,
   Australia. The model simulates a coupled surface water and groundwater
   system in which a lumped conceptual model is used to model
   one-dimensional movement through the unsaturated zone, and a distributed
   model is used to simulate three-dimensional saturated groundwater flow.
   Movement of water through the unsaturated zone was found to be dominated
   by macropore flow, and accordingly the classical matrix flow
   approximations described by the Richards equation were not used.
   Instead, a conceptual model of the unsaturated zone was developed to
   simulate soil infiltration, recharge to the underlying groundwater
   system, capillary rise and crop evaporation on a daily time-step for
   each active cell within the model domain. Subsurface lateral flow
   between each vertical soil column is not permitted, though once in the
   saturated zone lateral flows are handled by the groundwater model. Salt
   movement through the profile is simulated using a mass balance approach,
   and separate conceptual formulations are used to generate salt export
   along the drainage lines. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Most studies on the use of physically based hydrological models have
   identified saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) as one of the most
   sensitive input parameters. However, K-sat is also one of the most
   difficult landscape properties to measure accurately, casting doubt on
   the ability of modellers to estimate this parameter a priori for
   catchment simulations. Several studies have shown that K-sat estimates
   are greatly influenced by the measurement method used, primarily because
   of scale effects. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of K-sat
   measurement method on catchment simulations aimed at predicting water
   yield from forested catchments. A series of simulations are conducted
   using the Topog\_Dynamic catchment model, with k(sat) estimated by means
   of the constant head well permeameter, small core (6.3 cm x 7.3 cm) and
   large core (22.3 cm x 30 cm) methods. These were applied in a deep,
   permeable forest soil in which macropore flow has been noted to occur.
   The three measurement methods yielded very different K-sat estimates and
   these had a large effect on model results. The model predictions based
   on small core and well permeameter measurements were extremely poor, as
   these methods did not adequately account for preferential flow through
   the soil. The large core estimates of K-sat, which were one to three
   orders of magnitude higher than the values obtained by the other two
   techniques, produced good predictions of catchment discharge and known
   spatial patterns of water table depth. Our results highlight the need
   for caution when applying soil hydraulic measurements to catchment-scale
   models. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A water balance model was used to simulate the long-term increases in
   water yield with forest age which are observed in the mountain ash
   (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of Victoria, Australia. Specifically, the
   hypothesis was tested that water yield changes could be explained by
   changes in evapotranspiration resulting from changes in leaf area index
   (LAI). A curve predicting changes in the total LAI of mountain ash
   forest was constructed from ground-based observations and their
   correlation with Landsat Thematic Mapper measurements of the transformed
   normalized difference vegetation index (TNDVI). A further curve for
   mountain ash canopy LAI was constructed from destructive LAI
   measurements and stem diameter measurements. The curves were
   incorporated within Macaque, a large-scale, physically based water
   balance model which was applied to three forested catchments (total area
   145 km(2)). The model was used to evaluate the effect of changes in LAI
   on predicted stream flow over an 82-year period spanning the 1939
   wildfires which burnt most of the area. The use of the LAI curves
   induced improvement in the predicted hydrographs relative to the case
   for constant LAI, but the change was not large enough to account for all
   of the difference in water yield between old-growth and regrowth
   forests. Of a number of possibilities, concomitant changes in leaf
   conductance with age were suggested as an additional control on stream
   flow. These were estimated using data on stand sapwood area per unit
   leaf area and coded into Macaque. The hydrograph predicted using both
   the LAI curves and a new leaf conductance versus age curve accurately
   predicted the observed long-term changes in water yield. We conclude
   that LAI is a partial control on long-term yield changes, but that
   another `water use efficiency per unit LAI' control is also operative.

Abstract = {{Simple hydraulic models for outflow of groundwater into a stream suggest
   that the form of the storage-discharge relationship for groundwater
   changes from linear, for a confined aquifer, to quadratic, for an
   unconfined flow. Tests of the form of stream flow recessions in 11
   streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments
   the storage-discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the
   quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions
   of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good
   approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In
   contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a
   storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage-discharge
   relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in
   the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another,
   attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An
   extension of the linear model to `leaky' catchments, where the recession
   reaches zero flow, has been tested on two data sets.
   The second part of the paper deals with algorithms for baseflow during
   surface runoff events - the problem of hydrograph separation. Algorithms
   with one, two and three parameters have been compared, using data for
   the same 11 streams, and the results show significant differences in the
   baseflow index (BFI) predicted for some catchments. The two-parameter
   algorithm, which is fitted subjectively, is more consistent in providing
   plausible results than either the one- or three-parameter algorithms,
   both of which can be fitted objectively. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Discharge in many rivers is often fed by outflow from a shallow
   groundwater reservoir. It is becoming clear that the outflow from this
   aquifer is not linearly proportional to storage as is commonly assumed
   in many algorithms. Numerical analysis of flow recession curves from
   about 100 river gauging stations instead reveals a nonlinear
   relationship between baseflow, Q, and storage, S, for which the equation
   S = aQ(b) was adopted. Values of the exponent b are found by calibration
   to be between 0 and 1 but with a high concentration around 0.5, which is
   in accordance with the findings of other studies and theoretical
   approaches yielding b = 0.5 for unconfined aquifers and relating the
   coefficient a to catchment properties, primarily area and shape of
   basin, pore volume and transmissivity. This non-linear reservoir
   function is proposed as a more realistic alternative to the linear
   reservoir function.
   The relatively fast response of groundwater flow to rainfall is mainly a
   result of the increase of hydraulic head of the groundwater reservoir
   accelerating the exfiltration of `old', pre-event water into the river
   bed. As fissure and pore volumes communicate hydraulically, it appears
   physically reasonable to model the system by one non-linear reservoir
   for catchments, or parts of them, instead of applying independent
   parallel linear reservoirs. The non-linear reservoir algorithms are
   supported by an analytical derivation. They are extended for the
   automatic separation of baseflow from a time-series of daily discharge
   in rivers and the computation of storage and effective recharge of
   groundwater in river basins by inverse nonlinear reservoir routing. The
   time-series obtained allow the identification and quantification of
   long-term changes to the water balance. Relationships between computed
   groundwater storage and observed groundwater level can also be
   established. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   an existing conceptual model of water and salt fluxes (LASCAM). In the
   model, sediment generation is based on a modified version of the
   universal soil loss equation. The sediment transport processes of
   channel deposition and re-entrainment, and bed degradation are coupled
   with the existing stream-routing algorithm of LASCAM. The model is
   applied to the Avon River Basin, a large, dry catchment in Western
   Australia. The paper highlights some of the scientific issues involved
   in quantifying the sediment discharge processes in this catchment and
   presents validation results comparing model predictions with
   observations of sediment transport at different locations in the
   catchment. The results indicate that despite the strongly non-linear
   relationship between stream flow and sediment load, both are predicted
   well by the model. The model also highlights that in the Avon River
   Basin, disproportionately more stream sediment is generated in the wheat
   belt region than in the lower catchment. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This overview presents background information to place the subsequent
   papers by Beavis et al., Dietrich et al. and Green et al, in the context
   of a unified approach. The modelling framework described here consists
   of two major components: an upland catchment model and an instream
   sediment transport model. The upland model simulates stream flow (Q),
   suspended sediment (SS) and associated phosphorus (P) using rainfall
   data, and is calibrated to daily stream flow time-series under
   historical conditions. The instream model routes SS and attached P from
   the outlet of upland catchments to gauging points downstream. The
   instream transport model can infer sources (resuspension and bank
   erosion) and sinks (deposition) within a reach. Aerial photographs are
   used to assess the on-site effects of climate and land cover/use on
   erosion and the drainage network. Changes in land cover/use and the
   effects on the drainage network are related to the parameters in the
   rainfall-runoff model so that associated effects on Q (and hence SS and
   P) can be assessed. This modelling framework is prototyped on the Namoi
   Basin in northern New South Wales, Australia, and is described briefly
   herein. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Since European settlement, considerable changes in land cover and land
   management have occurred in the Liverpool Plains as a response to
   agricultural expansion and development. As a consequence, erosion
   gullies have been initiated and subsequently have developed into
   extensive networks. Streams, erosion gully networks, rills, land cover
   and land management have been mapped and digitized on to a GIS using a
   number of aerial photographic time-slices. Information derived from the
   GIS-generated maps includes: (a) measurement of temporal and spatial
   changes in the fluvial and gully networks, and land use and land
   management practices; and (b) assessment of changes in the connectivity
   of gullies to streams. It has been shown that revegetation and erosion
   control works decreased the density of erosion gullies from 1943 to

Abstract = {{The mechanisms controlling the flow of sediment in streams can be very
   complex and difficult to model with accuracy. Furthermore, data
   associated with the dominant sediment transport processes are often
   scarce. In this paper, we propose a model for the transport of suspended
   sediment in single stream reaches that permits a characterization of the
   dynamics of sediment sources and sinks, and routes concentrations
   through a stream network. We present a closed form, physically based,
   one-dimensional model that incorporates sediment advection, deposition,
   resuspension and lateral sources along a river reach. Data requirements
   for the model are modest, with parsimonious model structure involving
   only a few parameters. Thus, the model is relatively easy to calibrate
   and implement. An application of the model is illustrated using
   turbidity and flow data from two single reaches of the Murray and
   Murrumbidgee rivers in south-eastern Australia. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{We seek an improved and quantitative understanding of the sources and
   transport of sediment and attached phosphorus in upland catchments and
   downstream reaches of the Namoi River in New South Wales, Australia.
   Study of the sources of phosphorus and related sediment was motivated by
   severe problems with blooms of blue-green algae and toxic by-products in
   the Darling and Namoi Rivers. Using atmospheric fall-out of
   radionuclides as tracers, Olley et al. (1996) concluded that much of the
   sediment deposited in the lower reaches came from subsoil rather than
   topsoil. With this insight, we focus on quantifying sediment sources
   from stream bank erosion, especially in seasonally erosional reaches of
   Cox's Creek and the Mooki River.
   The approach presented here integrates interdecadal aerial photography,
   interseasonal field measurements of bank erosion processes, continuous
   monitoring of stream flow and turbidity and event sampling of suspended
   solids and phosphorus, with an analytical model of in-stream suspended
   sediment transport. We compare a lateral source term in the calibrated
   transport model with field-based and aerial measurements of stream bank
   erosion. Calibration of the in-stream model is illustrated for two
   reaches of the Mooki River, with the changes in parameter values being
   related to aspects of the hydraulic geometry and particle size. The
   processes of stream flow and bank erosion due to undercutting,
   desiccation, block failure and mass wasting of aggregated particles
   interact to produce instream fluxes of suspended sediment that are
   transported and redeposited downstream. The combined approach
   demonstrated here has potential for predictive spatial modelling of
   sediment concentrations and loads. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In modelling the fate and transport of heavy metals, the sorption
   processes, through the distribution coefficient, are applied to
   determine the amount of sorbed and dissolved fractions. Usually, these
   distribution coefficients are assumed to depend only on suspended
   sediment interactions. In estuaries, however, observations indicate that
   dissolved concentrations increase with salinity. It is hypothesized that
   salt competes for binding sites, leading to lower distribution
   coefficients. To study the fate and transport of heavy metals in an
   estuarine environment, a two-dimensional finite volume, depth-averaged
   toxic transport model has been developed. The distribution coefficients
   are approximated as a function of sodium activity or salt concentration.
   Other model parameters are obtained from a recently developed
   hydrodynamic model, salt transport and cohesive sediment transport
   modules. The model has been applied to the Scheldt Estuary and the
   results for both sorbed and dissolved heavy metal concentrations agree
   fairly well with measured data, indicating that under estuarine mixing,
   salt concentration is an important factor affecting the fate and
   transport of heavy metals. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To evaluate the interactive effects of snow and forest on turbulent
   fluxes between the forest surface and the atmosphere, the surface energy
   balance above a forest was measured by the eddy correlation method
   during the winter of 1995-1996. The forest was a young coniferous
   plantation comprised of spruce and fir. The study site, in Sapporo,
   northern Japan, had heavy and frequent snowfalls and the canopy was
   frequently covered with snow during the study period. A comparison of
   the observed energy balance above the forest for periods with and
   without a snow-covered canopy and an analysis using a single-source
   model gave the following results: during daytime when the canopy was
   covered with snow, the upward latent heat flux was large, about 80\% of
   the net radiation, and the sensible heat flux was positive but small. On
   the other hand, during daytime when the canopy was dry and free from
   snow, the sensible heat flux was dominant and the latent heat flux was
   minor, about 10\% of the net radiation. To explain this difference of
   energy partition between snow-covered and snow-free conditions, not only
   differences in temperature but also differences in the bulk transfer
   coefficients for latent heat flux were necessary in the model.
   Therefore, the high evaporation rate from the snow-covered canopy can be
   attributed largely to the high moisture availability of the canopy
   surface. Evaporation from the forest during a 60-day period in midwinter
   was estimated on a daily basis as net radiation minus sensible heat
   flux. The overall average evaporation during the 60-day period was 0.6
   mm day(-1), which is larger than that from open snow fields. Copyright

Abstract = {{The Manchester Ship Canal(MSC) has been the recipient of domestic and
   trade effluent since 1895, it continues to be grossly polluted. In 1985
   the dock basins, now known as Salford Quays were isolated from the canal
   inorder to improve water quality and encourage redevelopment. Subsequent
   to isolation the dock basins received no effluent or drainage and
   Helixor pumps were installed to improve circulation, thereby preventing
   stratification and bottom water anoxia. Analysis of solid material, pore
   waters and phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) in cores taken from Salford
   Quays and the MSC was carried out to assess changes in sediment
   characteristics that might affect water quality. Loss of carbon was
   apparent in the upper sediment of Salford Quays, as was a greater
   proportion of reducible Fe, Mn, Zn and Cd compared with the MSG. In
   Salford Quays a superficial peak in Fe and Zn concentration appeared to
   be attributable to migration of metals in the pore water and
   precipitation of Fe oxyhydroxide at the oxic sediment water interface.
   Despite these differences, NH4+ and SO42- concentration pore water
   profiles were similar in both sediments if the MSC sediments were
   considered from a point below their top layers, which appeared to be
   composed of freshly deposited sewage. Bacterial biomass extrapolated
   from PLFA concentration also suggested that the upper sediment of the
   MSC was largely faecal. PLFA analyses to characterize changes in the
   microbial community, however, did not reveal any systematic changes.
   That this may have been because of an absence of vertical zonation was
   supported by pore water analyses. It was also apparent that the lack of
   systematic change might be due at least in part to an artefact of
   vestigial PLFA signatures, resulting from deposition and burial, and the
   need for finer vertical resolution in the sampling procedure.
   Despite incomplete and some contradictory findings it appears that
   although metal mobilization may result from the development of an oxic
   sediment water interface, the extremely high original organic content of
   the sediment ensures that even after 10 years it exerts a high oxygen
   demand. Consequently, sediment management is likely to be a long-term
   commitment and as remediation proceeds the importance of continuity in
   management will increase. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed measurements of near-surface soil hydraulic conductivity, K-s,
   across the Bracciasco catchment (Central Italian Alps) are incorporated
   into a distributed, digital elevation model-based hydrological model to
   evaluate the effect of soil heterogeneity on catchment storm flow
   response. Surface and subsurface storm flow components are simulated for
   different distributions of K-s, including that obtained directly from
   measurements, that obtained by averaging measured data and others
   obtained on the basis of a simple functional parameter model, The
   reproduction of the catchment storm flow responses obtained using
   distributions of K-s based on measurements is satisfactory although an
   adjustment of such distributions is suggested to reproduce the
   hydrograph peaks owing to rapid surface runoff concentration and to
   improve the description of recession limbs at the same time. Numerical
   experiments indicate that the simulated storm flow response of the study
   catchment is substantially insensitive to near-surface soil
   heterogeneity in as far as the predominant mechanism of channel storm
   flow generation is subsurface flow. However, K-s is found to play an
   important role in the generation of overland flow during intense
   rainfall and, under these circumstances, monitoring of near-surface
   heterogeneity may be important to provide accurate descriptions of both
   surface and subsurface storm flow components. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Plots of solute concentration against discharge have been used to relate
   stream hydrochemical variations to processes of flow generation, using
   data collected at four streams in the Catskill Mountains, New York,
   during the Episodic Response Project of the US Environmental Protection
   Agency. Results suggest that a two-component system of shallow and deep
   saturated subsurface flow, in which the two components respond
   simultaneously during hydrologic events, may be applicable to the study
   basins. Using a large natural sea-salt sodium input as a tracer for
   precipitation, it is argued that an additional distinction can be made
   between preevent and event water travelling along the shallow subsurface
   flow path. Pre-event water is thought to be displaced by infiltrating
   event water, which becomes dominant on the falling limb of the
   hydrograph. Where, as appears to be the case for sulfate, a solute
   equilibrates rapidly within the soil, the pre-event-event water
   distinction is unimportant. However, for some solutes there are clear
   and consistent compositional differences between water from the two
   sources, evident as a hysteresis loop in concentration-discharge plots.
   Nitrate and acidity, in particular, appear to be elevated in event water
   following percolation through the organic horizon. Consequently, the
   most acidic, high nitrate conditions during an episode generally occur
   after peak discharge. A simple conceptual model of episode runoff
   generation is presented on the basis of these results. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Values of evapotranspiration are required for a variety of water
   planning activities in arid and semi-arid climates, yet data
   requirements are often large, and it is costly to obtain this
   information. This work presents a method where a few, readily available
   data (temperature, elevation) are required to estimate potential
   evapotranspiration (PET). A method using measured temperature and the
   calculated ratio of total to vertical radiation (after the work of
   Behnke and Maxey, 1969) to estimate monthly PET was applied for the
   months of April-October and compared with pan evaporation measurements.
   The test area used in this work was in Nevada, which has 124 weather
   stations that record sufficient amounts of temperature data. The
   calculated PET values were found to be well correlated (R-2 =
   0.940-0.983, slopes near 1.0) with mean monthly pan evaporation
   measurements at eight weather stations.
   In order to extrapolate these calculated PET values to areas without
   temperature measurements and to sites at differing elevations, the state
   was divided into five regions based on latitude, and linear regressions
   of PET versus elevation were calculated for each of these regions. These
   extrapolated PET values generally compare well with the pan evaporation
   measurements (R-2 = 0.926-0.988, slopes near 1.0). The estimated values
   are generally somewhat lower than the pan measurements, in part because
   the effects of wind are not explicitly considered in the calculations,
   and near-freezing temperatures result in a calculated PET of zero at
   higher elevations in the spring months. The calculated PET values for
   April-October are 84-100\% of the measured pan evaporation values. Using
   digital elevation models in a geographical information system,
   calculated values were adjusted for slope and aspect, and the data were
   used to construct a series of maps of monthly PET. The resultant maps
   show a realistic distribution of regional variations in PET throughout
   Nevada which inversely mimics topography. The general methods described
   here could be used to estimate regional PET in other arid western states
   (e.g. New Mexico, Arizona, Utah) and arid regions world-wide (e.g. parts
   of Africa). Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Permeable pavements and similar stormwater control devices have not been
   exploited in the UK, in part because their adoption has been hindered by
   a lack of detailed knowledge of their hydrological performance. This
   paper describes a research programme that produced detailed information
   on the hydrological behaviour of a car park surface. The study involved
   the construction of full-scale permeable pavement model car park
   structures and a rainfall simulator for use in the laboratory. A
   monitoring procedure was developed in order to measure inputs and
   changes in drainage, storage and evaporation over short and long
   time-scales (2 hours to 3 months). A range of simulated rainfalls, which
   varied in intensity and duration, was applied to the model car park
   surfaces. Hydrological processes were monitored over an 18-month period.
   Results demonstrated that evaporation, drainage and retention in the
   structures were strongly influenced by the particle size distribution of
   the bedding material and by water retention in the surface blocks. In
   general, an average of 55\% of a one-hour duration, 15 mm h(-1) rainfall
   event could be retained by an initially air-dry structure. Subsequent
   simulations demonstrated that 30\% of a one-hour duration, 15 mm h(-1)
   rainfall event could be stored by an initially wet structure (with a
   minimum time interval between rainfall applications of 72 hours).

Abstract = {{An analysis of scaling effects is performed to evaluate whether data
   aggregation is a useful regionalization tool or whether it leads to an
   unacceptable loss of information. One issue concerns the appropriate
   resolution of digital elevation models (DEMs) used to derive
   geomorphological input parameters for hydrological models. In
   particular, the scale problem of watershed division by a channel network
   and smaller sub-basins is addressed. The investigation involved
   commercially available data sets with different horizontal and vertical
   resolutions and systematically aggregated DEMs. A stream network and the
   contributing subareas were derived from a DEM with a distinct critical
   support area. By varying this threshold area various watershed
   configurations were obtained. The sensitivity of surface runoff
   simulations to all watershed configurations was studied with synthetic
   storms and by means of an infiltration excess runoff model.
   The study revealed that elevation data with different resolutions
   diverge enormously in landscape representation and in the derived
   parameters such as slopes, flow directions and channel networks. Coarse
   DEMs show a smoother terrain and shorter flow paths than highly resolved
   data. The contributing threshold area controls the extent of the
   watershed configuration and therefore determines the drainage density.
   These topographic and geomorphological features were used to explain
   differences in the runoff simulation results. When watershed
   configurations with a varying extent of the channel network were derived
   from a distinct DEM and then used to simulate surface runoff, the
   drainage densities of the configurations correlated with the simulated
   runoff volume. A distinct drainage density, however, did not necessarily
   lead to similar simulation results when different DEMs were used. Since
   the hydrological model permits reinfiltration, the runoff volume depends
   directly on the lengths of the overland flow. Therefore, the mean length
   of the overland flow paths might to a certain degree be considered as a
   scaling factor. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the significance of groundwater dominance in the
   surface water system through a combination of review and an exposition
   of the general hydrology, ecology and geomorphology of rivers draining
   the main UK aquifers. Groundwater dominance is shown to vary according
   to the nature of the aquifer lithology, the mechanism of
   groundwater:surface water interaction and the scale at which one
   examines this interaction. Using data derived from a range of studies
   including the UK Environment Agency River Habitat Survey and the UK
   Institute of Freshwater Ecology RIVPACS invertebrate database it is
   shown that the nature of the aquifer and mode of influent discharge
   strongly control the hydrological and ecological characteristics of the
   environment but that a specific groundwater ecology or
   hydrogeomorphology is masked by the overriding controls exerted by
   aquifer geology and catchment topography. Despite this, it is clear that
   river systems dominated by groundwater flows have specific hydrological
   characteristics and management issues that require holistic,
   multidisciplinary approaches that recognise the significance of
   groundwater and the nature of the interaction with the surface water
   environment. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrological exchange processes in alluvial flood plains occur along
   several major pathways operating at different scales. Ground
   water-surface water interactions exert major control on structural and
   functional attributes of stream ecosystems. The role of ground water on
   environmental conditions in surface water habitats was investigated as
   part of a holistic ecological study of Val Roseg, a complex glacial
   flood plain in the Swiss Alps. Six channel types were identified based
   on surface hydrological connectivity with the main channel and water
   source: the main channel, side channels, intermittently-connected
   channels, mixed channels, groundwater channels, and tributaries. The
   groundwater channels have no upstream connection with surface channels
   since they are fed by alluvial or tributary aquifers. Compared with
   Other channel types, groundwater channels are characterised by
   relatively high and constant temperatures, low turbidity, and high
   specific conductance, bicarbonate and nitrate concentrations. Different
   types of groundwater habitats were delineated, based on their silica
   concentrations and temporal patterns of specific conductance. Increases
   in the concentrations of major ions with declining discharge clearly
   show a shift from a glacier meltwater-dominated flood plain in summer to
   a groundwater-dominated system in autumn and winter. A conceptual model
   was developed to portray the different groundwater reservoirs and flux
   pathways thought to structure the habitat template of the Val Roseg
   hydrosystem. This model serves as a framework for future studies of the
   role of ground water in sustaining what appear to be diverse and
   abundant benthic and interstitial communities in this harsh environment.

Abstract = {{Human activities, such as high fertilizer applications, groundwater
   abstractions and land use changes, might have a negative impact on
   drinking water supply, environment and nature reserves of the chalk
   region in the Dutch-Belgian boundary area. In this area, the groundwater
   and surface water systems of the Noor experimental catchment have been
   monitored intensively and modelled to investigate groundwater flow and
   the transport of nitrate to groundwater-dominated streams. Groundwater
   flow towards the riparian area, the springs and Noor brook is strongly
   controlled by long-term variation of the groundwater recharge.
   Relatively small, but permanent changes in the recharge have a higher
   impact on spring flow and stream flow than current groundwater
   abstraction in this chalk catchment. Land use, groundwater flow patterns
   and the characteristics of the geological formations result in
   distinctly different groundwater types and associated nitrate
   concentrations. High concentrations were found under the plateau (median
   55 mg l(-1)) and extremely low in the riparian area (median 2 mg l(-1)).
   The springs and thereby the Noor brook are mainly fed by groundwater
   directly cowing from the plateau with a low probability of
   denitrification, This results in median NO3- concentrations which are
   clearly above the drinking water standard of 50 mg l(-1) (i.e. 68 and 58
   mg l(-1)). Monitoring and modelling show that the north springs have
   higher NO3- concentrations than the south springs due to different
   probabilities of denitrification. Nitrate in the groundwater-dominated
   Noor brook is hardly correlated with the discharge, but the major spring
   shows a clear upward trend in terms of nitrate concentrations, i.e. an
   increase by about 30 mg l(-1) from 1980 onwards. A policy of reduced
   nitrogen application will result in lower nitrate concentrations in the
   surface water system not earlier than in 10 or 20 years, because of the
   long travel times of water particles in the unsaturated and saturated
   zone. The north springs will react earlier than the south springs.

Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{Field measurements have established the heat budgets for stations on two
   water courses which drain catchment areas dominated by the upper chalk
   in Dorset, UK. Information on the main advective and non-advective heat
   fluxes were collected during winter and summer periods in 1994 at a site
   near to a spring source on a tributary of the River Piddle, and at a
   station situated downstream on the River Bere. Inputs of heat energy
   were dominated by radiative fluxes, with net radiation receipt
   accounting on average for around 90\% of the non-advective total in both
   summer and winter. Sensible heat (convective/conductive) transfer from
   the atmosphere was enhanced in the summer by the lower water temperature
   of these spring-fed streams, while relatively warm water temperatures
   during winter enhanced heat losses by evaporation, which was the
   dominant non-advective heat loss component in this season. Significant
   heat losses also occurred by sensible transfer and by back radiation.
   Summer measurements revealed that conduction of heat into the
   non-vegetated gravel bed of the River Piddle tributary was the dominant
   form of loss, but this output was strongly reduced in summer by weed
   cover on the bed of the River Bere, Considerable daily and diel
   variability was evident in non-advective heat flux components. Heat
   advected into the study reaches via precipitation was negligible, but
   groundwater inflows added to the heat storage of the water courses in
   both winter and summer. This effect was most marked at the headwater
   site and in the summer season because of lower streamflow discharge.

Abstract = {{Concern for sediment problems in the Upper River Piddle, Dorset,
   including accumulation of fine sediment on the channel bed and elevated
   turbidity levels during periods of stable flow, provided the stimulus
   for a detailed field investigation of the sediment dynamics of this
   chalk stream system undertaken during the period November 1991 to April
   1993. Two monitoring stations were established at South Farm,
   Piddletrenthide and Lawrence Mede, Piddlehinton and estimates of
   suspended sediment load were obtained for these two sites. In addition,
   suspended sediment concentrations and bed sediment loadings were
   regularly sampled at several other sites, sediment traps were deployed
   at ten representative sites along the river channel, field observations
   of sediment sources and pathways were made during storm events and a
   sediment source fingerprinting study was undertaken. Estimates of annual
   suspended sediment yield provided values of 9-12 t km(-2) year(-1),
   which must be seen as low by UK standards. Elevated suspended sediment
   concentrations were not restricted to storm events, but occurred
   throughout the monitoring period in response to remobilisation of
   sediment stored in the channel. The evidence provided by the sediment
   loads recorded at the two monitoring stations, by the sediment traps and
   by the measurements of bed sediment loading, indicated that substantial
   amounts of sediment accumulated in the channel of the upper and middle
   reaches of the river during the winter months and that this `slug' of
   sediment was slowly transmitted downstream during the following summer.
   Fingerprinting of the transported sediment and of potential sources
   indicated that the dominant source of suspended sediment was likely to
   be surface soil from cultivated areas. Field reconnaissance surveys
   undertaken during storm events indicated that substantial inputs of
   surface runoff and suspended sediment entered the stream. Much of this
   sediment is, however, stored within the channel system and slowly
   transmitted downstream. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Recovery of headwater stream flora following the 1989-1992 groundwater
   drought}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Pages = {{341-354}},

Abstract = {{Over a three year period in spring, summer and autumn from 1993 to 1995
   118 sites on 24 headwater reaches of groundwater streams were
   investigated. Half were also surveyed at least once the previous year.
   Example rivers were chosen from catchments where there are no
   abstractions, where there are small or large historical ones, and where
   reductions or variations in abstractions were likely to occur during the
   study period.
   Key objectives of the study were to identify the effects of atypical low
   flows and bed drying on aquatic and wetland plants following an
   exceptionally long period of poor groundwater recharge between 1989-92.
   The extended drought, followed by two years of very good groundwater
   recharge, provided a unique opportunity to determine the rate, and
   extent, of recovery. Such knowledge is crucial for conservation bodies,
   water regulators and water utilities to help them make judgements on the
   degree of impacts groundwater abstractions have/could have on river
   flows, and separating these from natural causes.
   The macrophyte survey data have been used to develop a classification
   system for headwater streams fed by groundwater. Thirteen different
   community types were recognised, these giving a clear insight into the
   flora expected in groundwater streams based primarily on flow
   periodicity and channel form. Determining the behaviour of individual
   species helps in environmental assessment of proposed new abstractions,
   and allows accurate predictions on which ones might decline, be lost or
   invade. It is equally valuable for predicting the benefits of
   alleviation strategies based on target flows.
   Lesser water-parsnip, brook water-crowfoot, blunt-fruited water-starwort
   and whorl-grass were identified as the most characteristic species of
   perennial reaches of headwater chalk streams. Pond water-crowfoot only
   dominates in reaches where flow fails for short periods in late autumn.
   Marsh foxtail is a classic indicator of winter wet/summer dry flow
   channels.
   The River Ver was one of the study rivers, for which environmental
   impacts from abstractions were well accepted. During the period of
   survey the River benefited from a low-flow alleviation programme, based
   on ceasing abstractions from a headwater bore hole. Dramatic changes
   occurred to the flora in the river following this, these being greater,
   and sustained for longer, than in any of the other 23 rivers surveyed.
   The research has clearly shown that there are very distinctive
   communities associated with streams in the upper reaches of groundwater
   catchments, and these can be correlated with different flow and physical
   habitat characteristics. Some communities are very stable, and changed
   little during and after the drought; others are highly sensitive, and
   changed dramatically after flows returned to `normal' at the end of the
   drought, or when impacting abstractions were curtailed. In most systems
   flora returned to predicted stable states within two years of normal
   recharge, even at locations where there had been no flow for several
   years. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Macroinvertebrate fauna were collected from 15 reaches along the length
   of the River Frome, a lowland groundwater-dominated river in Dorset,
   southern England. The Frome arises in Upper Greensand and Gault Clay
   before flowing through Chalk and finally Tertiary deposits of gravel and
   sand. Sampling took place in the summer of 1995 and identification was
   taken to family level. The relation between longitudinal changes in the
   faunal assemblages and geology in the catchment was examined using
   multivariate methods. A preliminary classification of all sites was
   carried out using TWINSPAN analysis. The 15 sites separated into four
   distinct groups with all three replicates from any one site always found
   in the same group. Group I (comprising only the headwater site) and
   Group IV were associated with the mixed Upper Greensand geology, Group
   II with Chalk and Group III with the Tertiary gravels. These data were
   supported by a separate correspondence analysis and would appear to show
   a pattern between geology in the catchment and the distribution of
   fauna. However, because the geological changes along the Frome valley
   occur sequentially downstream, it is not possible to separate geological
   effects from factors related to position downstream. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{The macroinvertebrate fauna of a 50 m site on a partially shaded
   perennial section of the River Lambourn in Berkshire was studied
   intensively between 1971 and 1979. This period included a minor drought
   in 1973 and a major drought in 1976.
   A quantitative sampling programme for macroinvertebrates was undertaken
   on each of five distinct biotopes (Berula, Callitriche, Ranunculus,
   gravel and silt). Each one was sampled in March, June, September and
   December of 1971 and thereafter in June and December from 1972 to 1979.
   Five replicate sampling units from each biotope were processed
   separately prior to determination of density estimates, except in 1972
   and 1973, when lime constraints necessitated bulking and subsampling.
   Family richness per sampling unit and per sample was higher in December
   than June, and higher on the three macrophytes than on gravel and silt.
   Nevertheless, over nine years, a high proportion of the 59 families
   recorded on the site were collected on each biotope.
   During the extreme drought of 1976, there was no evidence of loss of
   family richness on the site, but some biotopes supported unusually high
   densities of macroinvertebrates from a limited number of families. By
   combining information on the density of invertebrates per biotope and
   the area of each biotope, the weighted mean density of invertebrates on
   the site was calculated for each sampling occasion.
   Seasonal and between-year changes in the densities of numerically
   important families were observed and a variety of responses to discharge
   regime were noted. Overall, the macroinvertebrate fauna appeared to be
   capable of rapid recovery after an extreme drought event on this
   unpolluted perennial site. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Chalk streams are characterised by naturally regulated flow regimes but
   their headwaters (winterbourne streams), are typified by periods of
   desiccation alternating with periods of high flow. This pager describes
   the impacts of drought on the macroinvertebrate community of the Little
   Stour River, Kent. Following the 1988-1992 drought, riverine habitats
   were severely degraded and some dewatering of previously perennial
   reaches occurred. Large volumes of fine sediment were deposited at the
   channel margins and on the river bed. In the summer of 1992 the relative
   abundance of macroinvertebrates was low. However, recovery was dramatic
   in the following three years. In 1995 a severe summer rainfall deficit
   had no detectable deleterious impact on the macroinvertebrate community,
   reflecting the importance of winter groundwater recharge in sustaining
   summer Bows in chalk streams. Few taxa were eliminated as a result of
   the drought, suggesting the presence of refugia from which
   recolonisation of taxa could take place. The results are discussed in
   relation to the reported impact of drought on other groundwater fed
   rivers. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Fishes inhabiting screams and rivers in the interior of North America
   experience a continental climate. Water temperatures reach 0 degrees C
   in winter and are high in summer. There is a marked seasonal cycle in
   discharge. These circumstances make groundwater a crucial component of
   Fiver habitats, Groundwater can influence the distribution, reproductive
   success, biomass and productivity, behaviour and movements of fishes,
   and is especially important in winter and summer. Winter flows are
   minimal and are affected by ice. In winter, the importance of
   groundwater increases northwards. Groundwater provides overwintering
   habitat free of subsurface ice and fish may migrate long distances to
   take advantage of it. The melt season can account for up to half the
   annual discharge. In summer, groundwater is important for maintaining
   discharge and moderating stream temperatures. During critically hot
   weather, groundwater refugia protect species exposed to temperatures
   approaching their thermal limits. Since groundwater exerts such an
   important influence on river habitats, its quality, quantity and
   sustainability should be considered before development proposals are
   approved which could alter it. Examples of the role of groundwater in
   the ecology of some species show how localised and critical habitats
   influenced by groundwater can be, and, in consequence, how necessary it
   is to protect them. Protection is complicated because groundwater
   distribution pathways are often unknown and recharge areas may be remote
   from discharges. Scale becomes important in identifying potential risks
   to critical stream habitats from all types of landscape modification and
   water abstraction. Groundwater temperatures reflect mean annual air
   temperatures and are likely to change as global climates respond to
   increases in the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This could
   profoundly change critical fish habitats, particularly those at the
   margins of species distributions or those that are already overcrowded.
   Such considerations emphasise the importance of developing proper
   strategies for the conservation of groundwater. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Microthermal gradients, involving significant variations in temperature
   over distances of a few centimetres to a few metres, were investigated
   in the water column and substratum of the River Frome and Bere Stream in
   Dorset, UK, which are groundwater dominated streams fed by chalk
   aquifers. In many of the sections surveyed, strong lateral contrasts of
   up to c. 7 degrees C were evident as a consequence of solar heating of
   shallow channel margin zones and thin surface layers isolated by
   floating vegetation from the main body of flow. Shading by instream,
   emergent and riparian vegetation, and by river banks also caused
   significant microthermal gradients in the water column. Detailed logging
   of temperatures in the substratum at selected sites revealed damping of
   variation with increasing depth below the bed surface, seasonal reversal
   in bed temperature gradients and considerable local variation in the
   substratum temperature profiles of a pool-riffle sequence. The latter
   did not conform to the pattern expected from advective heat transfer
   associated with downwelling of water at the riffle head and upwelling at
   the tail, and measurements of interstitial flow velocities and particle
   size suggested more complex flow circulation and heat transfer. There
   was some evidence that the microthermal gradients identified were of
   ecological significance. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Water temperatures within brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) spawning gravels
   were measured in two Hampshire chalk streams from October 1995 to April
   1996 inclusive. During the winter, mean intra-gravel water temperatures
   were higher than those in the stream, and increased with depth in the
   gravel bed. The amplitude of diel fluctuations in water temperature
   decreased with depth in the gravel bed, although diel fluctuations were
   still evident at a depth of 30 cm. Differences in intra-gravel
   temperature gradients between the two study sites were attributed to
   differences in the amplitude of stream water temperature fluctuations
   and there was no evidence that either of the study sites were located in
   zones of upwelling groundwater. Published equations are used to predict,
   from temperature, the timing of important stages in the development of
   brown trout embryos (eyeing, hatching and emergence) for eggs spawned in
   the autumn and winter and buried at different depths in the gravel bed.

Abstract = {{The Instream Flow Incremental Methodology (IFIM) using the Physical
   Habitat Simulation (PHABSIM) system, has seen increasing application to
   the assessment of changes in aquatic habitats in the UK over the last 10
   years. In particular, the model has been applied operationally to chalk
   streams (e.g. the Rivers Allen and Piddle) in southern England for the
   alleviation of low flow (ALF) problems. More recently, the model has
   also been used to examine the effect of changes in channel morphology
   upon aquatic habitats, such as those that occur during flood defence, or
   river channel restoration, schemes. The paper outlines some of the
   issues related to the application of the model to groundwater dominated
   rivers, such as chalk streams, and provides examples of the application
   of the model to a water resource issue and to assess a habitat
   restoration scheme.
   The paper also reports on three areas of recent research to improve the
   methodology: (1) choice of representative study sites and habitat
   variation at the reach and sector scale; (2) modelling of time series
   and interpretation of alternative water management regimes; and (3) the
   development of rapid assessment techniques based upon the transfer of
   standardised relationships bf tween available habitat and discharge.

Abstract = {{Siltation of spawning gravels in upland rivers appears to be an
   increasing hindrance to salmonids' spawning success, River managers seek
   an effective and non-labour intensive means of loosening gravel and
   reducing fine material, so improving spawning success; this study
   compared three practical gravel cleaning techniques, applied at
   realistic (rather than intensive) levels, by assessing survival to
   hatching of buried brown trout, Salmo trutta L,, ova at five sites on
   four rivers with gravel substrate in southern England. Each site
   consisted of six reaches, of which three were cleaned by tractor
   rotovating, high pressure jet washing and pump washing; these were
   compared with adjacent, untreated reaches. Brown trout ova were buried
   in both fine mesh and coarse mesh boxes in each reach.
   Significant improvements (at P < 0.05) in survival (number of live
   alevins) were found in three of the five pump washed reaches, two of the
   five tractor rotovated reaches and one pressure washed reach when the
   data were analysed by site. When data from all five sites were analysed
   together, all treated reaches showed a significant improvement (at P <
   0.05) in egg survival to hatching compared with control reaches for fine
   mesh egg boxes; for coarse mesh boxes only pump washed reaches showed
   such an improvement.
   We feel that pump-washing provides the most effective, inexpensive and
   suitably non labour-intensive means of improving gravel, although
   ultimately it may be better to reduce the silt load of rivers. Freeze
   core bed samples taken before and immediately after cleaning were
   analysed for silt content; pump washing and high pressure washing may
   have reduced the amount of fine material. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The River Piddle, a small chalk stream in Dorset, supports a valuable
   fishery for brown trout. It is also heavily utilised for water
   abstraction, with a licensed maximum daily quantity of 197 Ml/d, of
   which 43.5\% can be taken from the groundwater. The largest licensed
   groundwater uses (by licensed volume) are public water supplies (PWS),
   of which there are four within the Piddle catchment.
   Investigations into the impacts of the largest PWS abstraction, at
   Briantspuddle, on the brown trout population and fisheries of the River
   Piddle demonstrated a spatial correlation between a zone of reduced
   river Bow and an area of low juvenile trout abundance, and a reduction
   in the period during which good quality trout fishing was available.
   Trout habitat was quantified by applying the Physical Habitat Simulation
   System (PHABSIM) in conjunction with a groundwater model. The resultant
   habitat duration curves and habitat time-series corresponding with
   historical and naturalised (zero abstraction) flow, indicated large
   habitat losses for juvenile trout.
   Using discharge habitat relationships a preferred flow regime for the
   river at Briantspuddle, designed to satisfy both ecological and
   recreational needs, was identified. This flow regime, which will be
   maintained by stream support, includes a `survival flow' for juvenile
   trout during the critical summer low flow period. Copyright (C) 1999

Abstract = {{Groundwater is an important resource, not least in south-eastern areas
   of England, where chalk is the dominant aquifer. Such chalk-fed stream
   ecosystems are rich and highly productive, they have particularly
   important springhead wetlands, and are characterised by fast-growing
   trout populations. The legislative framework, founded on the Minimum
   Acceptable Flow concept, is in place to protect these stream ecosystems.
   In surface water dominated catchments, normal operational rules use
   prescribed (usually hands-off) flows to protect in-river needs. Such
   rules are inappropriate for most groundwater-dominated catchments
   because of the slow response between change in groundwater abstraction
   and river flow. This paper illustrates the use of an Ecologically
   Acceptable Flow Regime (i) to determine a MAF based on the annual volume
   of flow, described as a how duration curve, to protect the riverine
   ecosystem at the catchment scale, and (ii) to set a prescribed flow that
   must be maintained locally by river support. Copyright (C) 1999 John

   Ivakhnenko and colleagues is an heuristic self-organization method. It
   establishes the input-output relationship of a complex system using a

   understanding and evaluating a role for GMDH in the investigation of the
   complex rainfall-runoff processes in a heterogeneous watershed in
   Taiwan. Two versions of the revised GMDH model are implemented: a
   stepwise regression procedure and a recursive formula. Eleven typhoon
   events in the Shen-cei Creek watershed, Taiwan, are used to build the
   model and verify its usefulness. The prediction results of the revised
   GMDH models and the instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) model are
   compared. Based on the criteria of forecasting precision and the rate
   and time of peak error, a much better performance is obtained with the

Abstract = {{We studied the temporal patterns of tracer throughput in the outflow of
   large (30 cm diameter by 38 cm long) undisturbed cores from the Panola
   Mountain Research Watershed, Georgia. Tracer breakthrough was affected
   by soil structure and rainfall intensity. Two rainfall intensities (20
   and 40 mm hr(-1)) for separate Cl- and Br- amended solutions were
   applied to two cores (one extracted from a hillslope soil and one
   extracted from a residual day soil on the ridge). For both low and high
   rainfall intensity experiments, preferential flow occurred in the clay
   core, but not in the hillslope core. The preferential flow is attributed
   to well-developed interpedal macrochannels that are commonly found in
   structured clay soils, characteristic of the ridge site. However, each
   rainfall intensity exceeded the matrix infiltration capacity at the top
   of the hillslope core, but did not exceed the matrix infiltration
   capacity at the middle and bottom of the hillslope core and at all
   levels in the clay core. Localized zones of saturation created when
   rainfall intensity exceeds the matrix infiltration capacity may cause
   water and tracer to overflow from the matrix into macrochannels, where
   preferential flow occurs to depth in otherwise unsaturated soil.

Abstract = {{Radiative characteristics in a forested drainage basin during the
   snowmelt season were examined in order to better understand and predict
   snowmelt runoff in the basin. A method for estimating net radiation in a
   forest (R-nf) was presented using the total sky view factor (P) and the
   sun path sky view factor (Q). Solar radiation, albedo, atmospheric
   radiation and air temperature observed at an open site were also
   required. The total and the sun path sky view factors were determined
   from all-sky photographs, Q was expressed as a linear function of P for
   0.15 < P < 0.86 regardless of forest type. For P < 0.15, Q was set to
   zero, and for P > 0.86, Q was equal to unity. The short-wave radiation
   budget at the forest floor (S-nf) increased with P, whereas the
   long-wave radiation budget (L-nf) decreased with P. R-nf increased with
   P for 0.15 < P < 0.86, and changed little with P for P < 0.15 and P >
   0.86, as the increase in S-nf was offset by the decrease in L-nf. The
   forest effect on R-nf was diminished under cloudy or high albedo
   conditions, because S-nf was easily offset by L-nf. This estimation
   method was extended to the whole basin, and R-nf was obtained over a
   watershed covered by trees. At the beginning of the snowmelt season when
   the albedo remained high, the forest effect became null because the
   decrease in S-nf was balanced by the increase in L-nf. As the albedo
   gradually lowered with the advance of the snowmelt season, the decrease
   in S-nf owing to forest covers exceeded the increase in L-nf, and the
   forest effect to decrease R-nf became evident. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{This study evaluated the attributes and uncertainty of non-point source
   pollution data derived from synoptic surveys in a catchment affected by
   inactive metal mines in order to help to identify and select appropriate
   methods for data analysis/reporting and information use. Dissolved zinc
   data from the Upper Animas River Basin, Colorado, USA, were the focus of
   the study. Zinc was evaluated because concentrations were highest
   relative to national water quality criteria for brown trout, and zinc
   had the greatest frequency of criteria exceedances compared with other
   metals. Data attributes evaluated included measurement and model error,
   sample size, non-normality, seasonality and uncertainty. The average
   measurement errors for discharges, concentrations and loadings were
   0.15, 0.1 and 0.18, respectively. The 90 and 95\% coefficients of
   confidence intervals for mean concentrations based on a sample size of
   four were 0.48 and 0.65, respectively, and ranged between 0.15 and 0.23
   for sample sizes greater than 40. Aggregation of data from multiple
   stations decreased the confidence intervals significantly, but
   additional aggregation of all data increased them as a result of
   increasing spatial variability. Unit area loading data were
   approximately log-normal. Concentration data were right-skewed but not
   log-normal. Differences in median concentrations were appreciable
   between snowmelt and both storm flow and baseflow, but not between storm
   flow and baseflow. Differences in unit area loadings between all flow
   events were large. It was determined that the average concentration and
   unit area loading values should be estimated for each flow event because
   of significant seasonality. Time weighted values generally should be
   computed if annual information is required. The confidence in average
   concentrations and unit area loadings is dependent on the computation
   method used. Both concentrations and loadings can be significantly
   underestimated on an annual basis when using data from synoptic surveys
   if the first flush of contaminants during the initial snowmelt runoff
   period is not sampled. The ambient standard for dissolved zinc for all
   events was estimated as 1600 mu g l(-1) using the 85th percentile of
   observed concentration data, with a 90\% confidence interval width of
   200 mu g l(-1). Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Complexity in simulating the hydrological response in large watersheds
   over long times has prompted a significant need for procedures for
   automatic calibration. Such a procedure is implemented in the
   basin-scale hydrological model (BSHM), a physically based distributed
   parameter watershed model. BSHM simulates the most important basin-scale
   hydrological processes, such as overland flow, groundwater flow and
   stream-aquifer interaction in watersheds. Here, the emphasis is on
   estimating the groundwater parameters with water levels in wells and
   groundwater baseflows selected as the calibration targets. The best set
   of parameters is selected from within plausible ranges of parameters by
   adjusting the values of hydraulic conductivity, storativity, groundwater
   recharge and stream bed permeability. The baseflow is determined from
   stream flow hydrographs by using an empirical scheme validated using a
   chemical approach to hydrograph separation. Field studies determined
   that the specific conductance for components of the composite hydrograph
   were sufficiently unique to make the chemical approach feasible. The
   method was applied to the Big Darby Creek Watershed, Ohio. The parameter
   set selected for the groundwater system provides a good fit with the
   estimated baseflow and observed water well data. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Solute transport in undisturbed soil is a complex process and detailed
   information on the transport characteristics is needed to provide
   fundamental understanding of the processes involved. X-ray computer
   tomography (CT) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) have been
   used to gain information on the transport characteristics. Both methods
   are non-intrusive and do not disturb the soil, in contrast to other
   methods. CT provides high resolution information on bulk density and
   macropores, while ERT provides a three-dimensional image of the internal
   resistivity structure. By adding a suitable solute under steady-state
   flow, the internal resistivity changes can be interpreted as a change in
   resident concentrations. In our experiment two cores from different
   field sites were investigated. The ERT measurements revealed two
   transport modes (one fast and one slow) in one of the cores and only one
   mode in the other. This was consistent with the results of transfer
   function modelling on the independently measured breakthrough curves
   (BTCs). The fast transport mode is perhaps a result of many connected
   macropores, detected by CT, but this could not be verified with the ERT
   measurements because of the coarser resolution. However, with ERT in
   both cases we were able to explain the observed ETC qualitatively.

Abstract = {{The distribution of organic carbon (OC) and of some metals (Cu, Mn)
   amongst the particulate (>0.2 mu m), colloidal (10 kDa-0.2 mu m) and the
   truly dissolved (<10 kDa) fractions of the River Marne was investigated
   during the phytoplankton spring bloom. A tangential ultrafiltration (UF)
   device was utilized to separate the colloidal fraction. On average, 22\%
   of the OC, 31\% of the Cu and 53\% of the Mn, usually assigned to the
   so-called dissolved fraction, were found in the colloidal fraction. The
   colloidal fraction exhibited a behaviour different from that of the
   particulate and truly dissolved fractions. Autochthonous production led
   to enrichment in the colloidal and particulate OC pools: up to 47\% of
   the total dissolved OC was in the colloidal fraction. An increase in the
   colloidal metal fraction, concomitant with a fall in the truly dissolved
   fraction, coincided with peaks in phytoplankton during the bloom. These
   phenomena might be related either to an increase in pH associated with
   photosynthetic activity, resulting in the precipitation of truly
   dissolved forms into the colloidal fraction, or to scavenging of the
   truly dissolved metals by the algal species of colloidal size.
   The interaction between the colloidal and the truly dissolved phases was
   very important. The partition coefficients of the Cu and Mn between the
   colloidal and truly dissolved fractions were higher than between the
   particulate and the truly dissolved fractions. This pattern is
   consistent with a greater specific surface area of colloids than
   macroparticles. Consequently, the adsorption and complexation capacities
   are enhanced in the colloidal fraction of the particulate matter.
   The extraction of hydrophobic complexes with Cu using C-18 Sep-Pak
   columns, showed that the Cu occurring in colloidal, total dissolved or
   truly dissolved forms was significantly complexed by the organic matter.
   The truly dissolved fraction might be complexed up to 100\% during a
   phytoplankton bloom. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Fractal dimensions of suspended solids in streams: comparison of

Abstract = {{Fluvial suspended sediment typically consists of a variety of complex,
   composite particles referred to as flocs, Flee characteristics are
   determined by factors such as the source, size and geochemical
   properties of the primary particles, chemical and biological coagulation
   processes in the water column and shear stress and turbulence levels in
   the stream, Studies of flee morphology have used two contrasting methods
   of sampling and analysis. In the first method, particles settle on a
   microscope slide and are observed from below using an inverted
   microscope, The second method uses filtration at no or low vacuum and
   particles deposited on the filter are observed with a microscope. Flee
   morphology can be quantified using fractal dimensions. The aims of the
   present study were to examine the effect of the two sampling methods on
   the fractal dimensions of particle populations, and to evaluate for each
   method how well the fractal dimensions at the various sampling sites
   reflect basin conditions. Suspended solids were collected in triplicate
   on inverted microscope slides and on 0.45 mu m Millipore HA filters in
   two southern Ontario streams with contrasting riparian zones during a
   minor runoff event resulting from the melt of a freshly fallen snowpack.
   An image analysis system was used to determine area, longest axis and
   perimeter of particles. The morphology of the particle population of
   each sample was characterized using four fractal dimensions (D, D-1, D-2
   and D-K). Systematic differences in fractal dimensions obtained with the
   two methods were observed. For the settling method, outlines of larger
   particles were frequently blurred because of the distance between the
   focal plane (the top of the inverted microscope slides) and the plane of
   the particle outline. In this method, the blurring of large particles
   can cause an increase in the projected area and length of the particle,
   The effect on the particle perimeter is unpredictable because it depends
   on the amount of detail lost through blurring and its effect on the
   apparent increase in particle size. Because of blurring, D and D-1 tend
   to be systematically lower for the settling method, whereas the net
   effect on D, is unpredictable. Particle size distributions derived from
   settling are typically coarser because small, low density particles may
   remain in the water column and all particles may not deposit on the
   slides, This loss of fines results in systematically lower DK values for
   the settling method compared with the filtration method. Fractal
   dimensions and particle size distributions obtained with the filtration
   method were sensitive to and clearly indicated differences between
   drainage basins and between sites within each basin. These differences
   were explained by basin characteristics and conditions. Fractal
   dimensions and particle size distributions obtained with the settling
   method were less sensitive to drainage basin characteristics and
   conditions, which limits their usefulness as process indicators,

Abstract = {{Deposition and storage of fine-grained (<62.5 mu m) sediment in the
   hyporheic zone of gravel bed rivers frequently represents an important
   cause of aquatic habitat degradation. The particle size characteristics
   of such fine-grained bed sediment (FGBS) exert an important control on
   its hydrodynamic properties and environmental impact. Traditionally,
   particle size analysis of FGBS in gravel bed rivers has focused on the
   absolute size distribution of the chemically dispersed mineral fraction.
   However, recent work has indicated that in common with fluvial suspended
   sediment, significant differences may exist between the absolute and the
   in situ, or effective, particle size composition of FGBS, as a result of
   the existence of aggregates, or composite particles. In the
   investigation reported in this paper, sealable bed traps that could be
   remotely opened to sample sediment deposited during specific storm
   runoff events and a laser back-scatter probe were used to quantify the
   temporal and spatial variability of both the absolute and effective
   particle size composition of FGBS, and the associated suspended sediment
   from four gravel bed rivers in the Exe Basin, Devon, UK. The absolute
   particle size distributions of both the FGBS and suspended sediment
   evidenced c. >95\% < 62.5 mu m sized primary particles and displayed a
   seasonal winter-summer fining, while the opposite trend was displayed by
   the effective particle size distribution of the FGBS and suspended
   sediment. The effective particle size distributions of both were
   typically highly aggregated, comprising up to 68\% > 62.5 mu m sized
   particles. Spatial variation in the effective particle size and
   aggregation parameters was of secondary importance relative to temporal
   variation. The effective particle size distribution of the FGBS was
   consistently coarser and more aggregated than the associated suspended
   sediment and there was evidence of aggregate break-up in samples of
   resuspended bed sediment. The implications of these findings for
   sediment transport modelling are considered. Copyright (C) 1999 John

Abstract = {{Hillslope hydrological modelling is considered to be of great importance
   for the understanding and quantification of hydrological processes in
   hilly or mountainous landscapes. In recent years a few comprehensive
   hydrological models have been developed at the hillslope scale which
   have resulted in an advanced representation of hillslope hydrological
   processes (including their interactions), and in some operational
   applications, such as in runoff and erosion studies at the field scale
   or lateral flow simulation in environmental and geotechnical
   engineering. An overview of the objectives of hillslope hydrological
   modelling is given, followed by a brief introduction of an exemplary
   comprehensive hillslope model, which stimulates a series of hydrological
   processes such as interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration into
   the soil matrix and into macropores, lateral and vertical subsurface
   soil water flow both in the matrix and preferential flow paths, surface
   runoff and channel discharge. Several examples of this model are
   presented and discussed in order to determine the model's capabilities
   and limitations. Finally, conclusions about the limitations of detailed
   hillslope modelling are drawn and an outlook on the future prospects of
   hydrological models on the hillslope scale is given.
   The model presented performed reasonable calculations of Hortonian
   surface runoff and subsequent erosion processes, given detailed
   information of initial soil water content and soil hydraulic conditions.
   The vertical and lateral soil moisture dynamics were also represented
   quite well. However, the given examples of model applications show that
   quite detailed climatic and soil data are required to obtain
   satisfactory results. The limitations of detailed hillslope hydrological
   modelling arise from different points: difficulties in the
   representations of certain processes (e.g. surface crusting,
   unsaturated-saturated soil moisture flow, macropore flow), problems of
   small-scale variability, a general scarcity of detailed soil data,
   incomplete process parametrization and problems with the interdependent
   linkage of several hillslopes and channel-hillslope interactions.

Abstract = {{Snow that is retained by a forest canopy may either sublimate or
   evaporate directly from the crown or drop as snow clumps or meltwater to
   the ground. Redistributed snow and meltwater affect the snow structure
   and prevent the formation of mechanically weak layers, which is the
   prerequisite for avalanche formation in forests. In this paper we
   describe the results of dye tracer experiments conducted in a subalpine
   forest near Davos, Switzerland. Before a snowfall event we stained
   snow-free branches of a spruce with a dye tracer solution. After
   snowfall the coloured meltwater dripping from the branches down on to
   the snowpack stained the percolation pathways of the meltwater in the
   snowpack. Photographs of the snow profiles indicate that the meltwater
   seeped almost vertically through the isothermal snowpack to the soil
   surface not exceeding the projected crown edge. Meltwater of different
   events moves along different preferential flow channels in the snow
   suggesting that old channels are not non-conducting and additional
   meltwater fronts create new channels. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Soil surface crusting, a common phenomenon on cultivated soils, has
   major implications for agriculture and the environment because of its
   effects on soil hydrological properties, erosion and crop establishment.
   The objectives of this study were to evaluate land use controls on crust
   formation and the hydraulic response of soils to crust development for a
   Patancheru series soil (clayey skeletal, mixed, isohyperthermic Udic
   Rhodustalf) in south-central India. Soil aggregates, obtained from
   cultivated (PL) and naturally vegetated fallow (NV) land, were packed
   into sample trays and subjected to laboratory rain simulation to form
   crusts. Thin sections and visual observation indicated that crust
   development reached a more advanced stage in the PL case compared with
   NV following 90 min of rain at 40-80 mm h(-1) intensity. This was
   reflected in a thicker crust layer with fewer voids in the former and a
   less smooth surface with partially disintegrated aggregates in the
   latter. The hydraulic response of the soil surface with the progression
   of crust development indicated a more permeable and less dense crust
   formed on NV than on PL soil. The results suggested that NV soil
   aggregates were more stable and that crust formation is more gradual for
   stable aggregates compared with the less stable PL aggregates. A
   structural crust-type formed on the Patancheru soil by means of parallel
   subprocesses involving translocation and illuviation of aggregate
   disruption by products, and raindrop compaction and particle
   rearrangement. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Physically based soil erosion simulation models require input parameters
   of soil detachment and sediment transport owing to the action and
   interactions of both raindrops and overland flow. A simple interrill
   soil water transport model is applied to a laboratory catchment to
   investigate the application of raindrop detachment and transport in
   interrill areas explicitly. A controlled laboratory rainfall simulation
   study with slope length simulation by flow addition was used to assess
   the raindrop detachment and transport of detached soil by overland flow
   in interrill areas. Artificial rainfall of moderate to high intensity
   was used to simulate intense rain storms. However, experiments were
   restricted to conditions where rilling and channelling did not occur and
   where overland flow covered most of the surface. A simple equation with
   a rainfall intensity term for raindrop detachment, and a simple sediment
   transport equation with unit discharge and a slope term were found to be
   applicable to the situation where clear water is added at the upper end
   of a small plot to simulate increased slope length. The proposed generic
   relationships can be used to predict raindrop detachment and the
   sediment transport capacity of interrill flow and can therefore
   contribute to the development of physically-based erosion models.

Abstract = {{Large bottomless lysimeters were investigated for their suitability as a
   tool in the study of water balances of treeless and tree-covered areas
   on a raised mire. The lysimeters, large enough to contain a mature tree,
   were developed to measure the liquid discharge from the peat monolith
   they enclosed. By determining the other, less elusive components of the
   water balance, this approach enables evapotranspiration rates to be
   estimated and comparisons between treeless and tree-covered areas to be
   made.
   The principal features of the design and operation of the lysimeters are
   described. Discharge measured with the lysimeters was analysed for
   short-term periods as well as for a hydrological year, and was compared
   with expected amounts of discharge obtained from a simplified water
   balance (D-exp = P - 1.1 E-t for the winter, and D-exp = P - 08 E-t for
   the summer). Results indicated that D was reliable for short intervals
   (10 days on average) with moderate amounts of rainfall. Under more
   extreme weather conditions, leakage underneath the lysimeter walls could
   occur, resulting from the strong slope-dependent water exchange across
   the lysimeter. Suggestions are made for improvements to the design of
   the lysimeter system, Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Stable isotopes in precipitation sampled at different locations and

   elucidate the circulation patterns of water over the island where
   groundwater is a major water resource and the characteristics of stable

   important indicator of groundwater flow. Areal and altitudinal variation
   of stable isotopes in precipitation showed the contribution of different
   air masses to the precipitation on mountain slope areas and in the
   atmosphere above and below the boundary at around 1000 m a.s.l. Seasonal
   change of the isotopic composition of precipitation also gave a good
   illustration of the influence of the dominant regional air currents on

Abstract = {{Snow cover is found across extensive areas of the northern hemisphere
   during the winter and early spring seasons. Meltwater provided by this
   snow cover can be an important source of freshwater for agriculture,
   domestic uses and hydroelectric power. Rapid ablation of the snowpack,
   however, can also pose environmental hazards such as flooding.
   The ability to forecast meltwater quantities is dependent upon a
   knowledge of the factors influencing the snowmelt process. This paper
   employs a hybrid modelling and synoptic climatological approach to
   investigate the relationships between synoptic weather patterns, surface
   energy fluxes and midwinter snowmelt in the northern Great Plains. The
   first objective of this study is to identify distinct synoptic patterns
   that are associated with days where significant snow cover ablation
   occurred. The second objective is to evaluate the relationships between
   synoptic-scale weather patterns, snow surface energy transfers and
   snowmelt. A case study of 21 February 1975 is used to illustrate these
   relationships. Unlike the other synoptic-type studies, which rely on
   empirically derived energy flux data from single index sires, this study
   employs a physically based snowpack model to generate estimates of
   energy fluxes, The use of modelled fluxes instead of measured values
   allows for a more spatially extensive analysis as surface fluxes over
   the entire study region can be analysed in conjunction with the
   prevailing synoptic-scale weather patterns.
   Three major synoptic types, characterized by the presence of a
   midlatitude cyclone, are associated with large midwinter snowmelt
   episodes in the northern Great Plains. The ease study illustrates how
   variations in temperature, humidity, cloud cover and wind speeds
   associated with such cyclonic storms can play a major role in affecting
   snow surface-atmosphere energy exchanges, As expected, elevated wind
   speeds and stronger temperature and humidity gradients significantly
   increased the transfers of sensible and latent heat between the snow
   surface and the atmosphere. Increased cloud cover near the low pressure
   centre reduced incoming solar radiation but through counter radiation
   also reduced the loss of long-wave radiation. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Passive-microwave derived observations of snow cover show potential to
   provide synoptically sensitive, and hydrologically and climatologically
   significant, information because of all-weather imaging capabilities,
   rapid scene revisit time and the ability to derive quantitative
   estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE). In this study, we seek to
   identify the dominant patterns of clustering in SWE imagery using the
   Getis statistic, a local indicator of spatial association, The SWE data
   were derived from five day-averaged Special Sensor Microwave/Imager
   (SSM/I) brightness temperatures using the Canadian Atmospheric
   Environment Service dual channel algorithm. The analysed data span one
   winter season (December-February 1988-1989) and are limited to a
   ground-validated prairie scene. National Center for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP) gridded atmospheric data (500 mb geopotential height;
   700 mb temperature) were incorporated into the study to investigate
   whether the spatial orientation of the Getis statistic clusters provides
   information on interaction between snow cover and the atmosphere.
   Results show that the direction of atmospheric airflow as expressed by
   the 500 mb geopotential height field corresponds strongly to the
   orientation of surface snow cover clusters with no time lag, The 700 mb
   temperature field is also a controlling influence on the snow cover
   clusters both through modifying cluster orientation and reinforcing
   cluster magnitude, (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A series of process-based algorithms has been developed to describe the
   accumulation, unloading and sublimation of intercepted snow in forest
   canopies. These algorithms are unique in that they scale up the physics
   of interception and sublimation from small scales, where they are well
   understood, to forest stand-scale calculations of intercepted snow
   sublimation. Evaluation of results from the set of algorithms against
   measured interception and sublimation, in a southern boreal forest jack
   pine stand during late winter, found that the coupled model provides
   reasonable approximations of both interception and sublimation losses on
   half-hourly, daily and event bases. Cumulative errors in the estimate of
   intercepted snow load over 23 days of test were 0.06 mm SWE, with a
   standard deviation of 0.46 mm SWE, Sublimation losses during the
   evaluation were high, approximately two-thirds of snowfall within this
   period. Seasonal intercepted snow sublimation as a portion of annual
   snowfall at the model test site was lower than sublimation during the
   tests, ranging from 13\% for a mixed spruce-aspen, 31\% for the mature
   pine and 40\% for a mature spruce stand. The results indicate that
   sublimation can be a significant abstraction of water from mature
   evergreen stands in northern forests and that the losses can be
   calculated by application of process-based algorithms. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the development and testing of snow algorithms with
   specific reference to their use and application in land surface models,
   New algorithms, developed by the authors, for estimating snow
   interception in forest canopies, blowing snow transport and sublimation,
   snow cover depletion and open environment snowmelt are compared with
   field measurements. Existing algorithms are discussed and compared with
   field observations. Recommendations are made with respect to: (a)
   density of new and aged snow in open and forest environments; (b)
   interception of snow by evergreen canopies; (c) redistribution and
   sublimation of snow water equivalent by blowing snow; (d) depletion in
   snow-covered area during snowmelt; (e) albedo decay during snowmelt; (f)
   turbulent transfer during snowmelt; and (g) soil heat flux during
   meltwater infiltration into frozen soils.
   Preliminary evidence is presented, suggesting that one relatively
   advanced land surface model, CLASS, significantly underestimates the
   timing of snowmelt and snowmelt rates in open environments despite
   overestimating radiation and turbulent contributions to melt. The
   cause(s) may be due to overestimation of ground heat loss and other
   factors. It is recommended that further studies of snow energetics and
   soil heat transfer in frozen soils be undertaken to provide improvements
   for land surface models such as CLASS, with particular attention paid to
   establishing the reliability of the models in invoking closure of the
   energy equation. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of rainfall on runoff from the highly glacierized basins
   containing Findelengletscher and Gornergletscher, Pennine Alps,
   Switzerland, is assessed for the periods May-September 1987 and 1993.
   Several major rainstorms produced high peak discharges in both seasons.
   Runoff response to prolonged heavy rainfall varied during the ablation
   season in both basins, but also differed between the two. Annual
   outbursts from the ice-dammed Gornersee also produced peak discharges
   from Gornergletscher. The transient snow-line partitions a glacierized
   basin into snow-covered and snow-free portions which, respectively,
   retain and return rapidly to runoff both meltwater and rain. Elevation
   of the 0 degrees C isotherm in the atmosphere interacts with basin
   hypsometry to determine the proportion of the catchment area that
   receives rain in a given event. Progressive rise of the transient
   snow-line in summer increases the size of the snow-free area, and hence
   the area of basin that rapidly responds to rainfall. Heavy rainfall
   appears to have produced an outburst from Findelengletscher in September
   1993. The largest rainfall-induced floods are most likely to occur in
   summer between mid-July and late-August, terminating periods of elevated
   air temperature, when thermally induced runoff is at a maximum and
   subglacial drainage pathways are well developed, or when rainfall
   induces outbursts in spring and late summer at times of declined
   internal drainage capacity. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Solute and runoff time-series at Finsterwalderbreen, Svalbard, provide
   evidence for considerable basal routing of water and the existence of at
   least two contrasting subglacial chemical weathering environments. The
   hydrochemistry of a subglacial upwelling provides evidence for a
   snowmelt-fed subglacial reservoir that dominates bulk runoff during
   recession flow. High concentrations of Cl- and crustal ions, high pCO(2)
   and ratios of {[}{*}SO42-/({*}SO42- + HCO3-)] close to 0.5 indicate the
   passage of snowmelt through a subglacial weathering environment
   characterized by high rock:water ratios, prolonged residence times and
   restricted access to the atmosphere. At higher discharges, bulk runoff
   becomes dominated by icemelt from the lower part of the glacier that is
   conveyed through a chemical weathering environment characterized by low
   rock:water ratios, short residence times and free contact with
   atmospheric gases. These observations suggest that icemelt is routed via
   a hydrological system composed of basal/ice-marginal, englacial and
   supraglacial components and is directed to the glacier margins by the
   ice surface slope. Upwelling water hows relatively independently of
   icemelt to the terminus via a subglacial drainage system, possibly
   constituting flow through a sediment layer. Cold basal ice at the
   terminus forces it to take a subterranean routing in its latter stages.
   The existence of spatially discrete flow paths conveying icemelt and
   subglacial snowmelt to the terminus may be the norm for
   polythermal-based glaciers on Svalbard. Proglacial mixing of these
   components to form the bulk meltwaters gives rise to hydrochemical
   trends that resemble those of warm-based glaciers. These hydrochemical
   characteristics of bulk runoff have not been documented on any other
   glacier on Svalbard to date and have significance for understanding
   interactions between thermal regime and glacier hydrology. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{Indicators are binary transforms of a variable and are 1 or 0, depending
   on whether the variable is above or below a threshold. Indicator
   variograms can be used for a similar range of geostatistical estimation
   techniques as standard variograms. However, they are more flexible as
   they allow different ranges for small and large values of a hydrological
   variable. Indicator geostatistics are also sometimes used to represent
   the connectivity of high values in spatial fields. Examples of
   connectivity are connected high values of hydraulic conductivity in
   aquifers, leading to preferential flow, and connected band-shaped
   saturation zones in catchments. However, to the authors' knowledge the
   ability of the indicator approach to capture connectivity has never been
   shown conclusively Here we analyse indicator variograms of soil moisture
   in a small south-east Australian catchment and examine how well they can
   represent connectivity. The indicator variograms are derived from 13
   soil moisture patterns, each consisting of 500-2000 point TDR (time
   domain reflectometry) measurements. Winter patterns are topographically
   organized with long, thin, highly connected lines of high soil moisture
   in the drainage lines. In summer the patterns are more random and there
   is no connectivity of high soil moisture values. The ranges of the
   50(th) and 90(th) percentile indicator semivariograms are approximately
   110 and 75 m, respectively, during winter, and 100 and 50 m,
   respectively, during summer. These ranges indicate that, compared with
   standard semivariograms, the indicator semivariograms provide additional
   information about the spatial pattern. However, since the ranges are
   similar in winter and in summer, the indicator semivariograms were not
   able to distinguish between connected and unconnected patterns. It is
   suggested that new statistical measures are needed for capturing
   connectivity explicitly. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Functional (regression) and cause-and-effect analytical methods were
   employed in the investigation of Factors controlling single-value
   sediment-discharge relationships for individual hydrological events in
   the Fraser River Basin. Of 1025 hydrological events identified in the 97
   years of the 9-stations discharge record monitored by the Water Survey
   of Canada (1960-1988), 49 were associated with linear, non-linear
   (concave and convex) sediment rating curves. Analysis revealed that time
   of events offered a partial explanation for the occurrence of
   single-valued curves because events occurring in isolation or in quick
   succession did not always produce single-valued curves owing to
   variations in hydrograph characteristics and temporal and spatial peak
   attenuation factors. Hydrologically, linear and non-linear sediment
   rating curves were distinguished by the influence of preceding discharge
   or antecedent moisture, which tends to generate quick or delayed runoff,
   thereby causing rapid or slow increases in sediment concentration in
   concert with discharge changes. Hydraulically, linear curves were shown
   to be controlled by rates of stream bed scour (rising stage) similar to
   those for channel filling (falling stage); concave curves by rates of
   scouring (rising stage) similar to those of filling but different from
   those of rescouring (failing stage); and convex curves by rates of
   filling and scouring (rising stage) different from those of filling and
   rescouring (falling stages), all in relation to the timing of the
   exceedance of the threshold discharge for stream bed scour.
   Meteorologically, bed scour and fill approximately coincided with the
   timing of precipitation, if any, on the rising and/or falling stages
   under subzero (T less than or equal to 0 degrees C), low (1 less than or
   equal to T less than or equal to 9 degrees C) and moderate (10 less than
   or equal to T less than or equal to 19 degrees C) temperature
   conditions. It is concluded that a combination of temporal, spatial,
   hydrological, hydraulic and meteorological factors control variations in
   sediment concentration during single hydrological events on the Fraser
   River in a complex fashion. Multivariate analysis of these factors
   should greatly improve prediction of sediment transport in the Fraser
   River Basin. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An equation for evaluating the sediment transport capacity of overland
   flow is a necessary part of a physically based soil erosion model
   describing sediment detachment and transport as distributed processes.
   At first, for the hydraulic conditions of small-scale and large-scale
   roughness, the sediment transport capacity relationship used in the WEPP
   model is calibrated by Yalin and Govers' equation. The analysis shows
   that the transport coefficient K-t depends on the Shields parameter, Y,
   according to a semi-logarithmic (Yalin) or a linear (Govers) equation.
   The reliability of the semi-logarithmic equation is verified by Smart's,
   and Aziz and Scott's experimental data. Then the Low's formula, whose
   applicability is also proved by Smart's, and Aziz and Scott's data, is
   transformed as a stream power equation in which a stream power
   coefficient, K-SP, depending on Shields parameter, slope, sediment and
   water-specific weight, appears. A relationship between transport
   capacity and effective stream power is also proposed. Finally, the
   influence of rainfall on sediment transport capacity and the prediction
   of critical shear stress corresponding to overland flow are examined.

Abstract = {{Meltwaters collected from the proglacial stream escaping from Zongo
   Glacier (2.1 km(2)), Bolivia (16 degrees S), have been monitored in
   order to analyse the internal drainage system of an Andean glacier.
   Electrical conductivity has been measured sporadically between February
   1995 and March 1996, during 26 one-day field surveys, under various
   meteorological conditions in summer and winter. The mixing-model
   technique based on the electrical conductivity is used for a
   quantitative separation of discharge which is derived from continuous
   water level registration. Tracer experiments (mainly uranine dye and
   NaCl salt) have been carried out from March to June 1997 to obtain
   information about the internal drainage system. In the tropical Andes,
   accumulation only occurs in austral summer, whereas ablation occurs
   throughout the year and is higher during the accumulation season,
   between November and March. The assumptions involved in the use of
   mixing models for analysis of glacial drainage structure are applicable
   for tropical glaciers because glacial conduits do not suffer complete
   closure, and are permanently supplied by meltwaters, even in wintertime.
   Two components of discharge are separated: an englacial flow originating
   from surface meltwater which is routed without chemical enrichment, and
   offering low electrical conductivity; and a subglacial one routed in
   contact with bedrock or sediments showing high ionic concentrations.
   Electrical conductivity of meltwater varies diurnally, inversely to
   discharge fluctuations. According to this behaviour, total discharge is
   mainly formed by the englacial component. The drainage structures for
   englacial and subglacial flow have to be widely interconnected, as
   indicated by diurnal variations of the subglacial discharge. Comparison
   of hydrograph separation based on conductivity and on O-18 isotope
   cofirms that the subglacial flow is influenced by surface melting. A
   hydrograph separation of the subglacial flow is proposed, between a
   diurnal variable component, composed of water coming from the englacial
   network, and a base flow, which may vary seasonally. The dye tracing
   experiments cofirm the drainage complexity of Zongo Glacier and
   demonstrate the interest of identifying three main drainage components.

Abstract = {{Sealing and crusting of soil surfaces have dramatic effects on water
   infiltration into and runoff from soils, thereby greatly influencing
   erosion processes. This study focused on the effect of the initial stage
   of crusting on inter-rill erosion processes for a crust-prone Alfisol
   sampled from south-central India. Soil aggregates ranging from 2.4 to 8
   mm collected from ploughed (PL) and naturally vegetated (NV) treatments
   were subjected to rainfall simulation under laboratory conditions.
   Runoff from PL soil aggregates was 2-2.5 times higher, while percolation
   was 20-100\% lower, than for NV aggregates. Soil wash and splash losses
   were 0.5-3 times greater for PL than for NV soil. Runoff and inter-rill
   erosion were significantly higher during the wet simulation run compared
   with the dry run. The results indicated that NV soil aggregates were
   more resistant to breakdown from raindrop impact and slaking, and
   subject to less rapid sealing, than PL soil. Total soil loss was
   influenced most by initial aggregate stability and the extent of seal
   development. Splash and wash losses of soil both increased as a result
   of surface sealing regardless of soil condition for short (30-60 min)
   rainfall durations. High drying rates resulted in the highest crust bulk
   densities. Increased crust strength for PL soil compared with NV soil
   reflected the greater susceptibility of cultivated soil to surface
   sealing and crusting. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneity of the solute flux field in the horizontal plane at
   the field scale has been documented in several field studies. On the
   other hand, little information is available on the persistence of
   certain solute transport scenarios over consecutive infiltration cycles.
   This study was initiated to analyse the recurrence of solute leaching
   behaviour as estimated in two soil column tests emphasizing the
   preferential flow phenomenon. Twenty-four small-sized soil samples were
   subjected to two consecutive unsaturated steady-state flow leaching
   experiments with bromide as tracer. Observed breakthrough curves (BTCs)
   were analysed by the method of moments and by the advection-dispersion
   equation (ADE) to classify solute behaviour. Frequency distributions of
   the parameters indicating the solute velocity were heavily skewed or
   bimodal, reflecting the broad variability of the leaching scenarios,
   including some with pronounced preferential solute breakthrough.
   Exclusion of the preferential flow columns from our calculations
   revealed an average amount of 37\% of immobile water. The large-scale
   BTCs derived from assembling the individual concentration courses of
   each run showed similar features, such as an early bromide breakthrough.
   However, two distinct apices, viz. one preferential and one matrix, were
   observed only in the first run, whereas the concentration decrease
   between the peaks was missing from the second run. A change in soil
   structure with continuous leaching was presumed to modify the interplay
   of the various flow domains, thereby altering the spreading of the BTCs.
   Correlation analysis between parameters of both tests suggests that
   preferential transport conditions are likely to occur at the same
   locations in the field over several infiltration cycles, whereas the
   `classical' or expected matrix flow is time variant and therefore seems
   to be hardly predictable. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   time-independent (or steady-state) cases of channel flow with
   infiltration were derived for three types of boundary conditions: zero
   flow at the upstream end, and critical flow depth and zero depth
   gradient at the downstream end. The diffusion wave approximation was
   found to be in excellent agreement with the dynamic wave approximation,
   with errors of less than 1.4\% for KF02 greater than or equal to 7.5,
   and up to 14\% for KF02 less than or equal to 0.75 for the upstream
   boundary condition of zero discharge and finite depth, where Kis the
   kinematic wave number and Fo is the Froude number. The kinematic wave
   approximation was reasonably accurate except at the channel boundaries
   and for small values of KF02(less than or equal to 1). The accuracy of
   these approximations was significantly influenced by the downstream
   boundary, both in terms of the magnitude of the error and the segment of
   the channel reach for which these approximations would be applicable.

Abstract = {{Land use in Japan for c. 1900, 1950 and 1985 has been reconstructed,
   based on the 1:50 000 topographic maps for these periods, and digitized.
   These data sets have then been used for the analyses of land use/cover
   changes, model simulations and checking of the models. This paper
   outlines how the data sets have been used and what has been found
   regarding the land use/cover changes in Japan over the last hundred
   years, and presents the frameworks and results of empirical models of
   the changes.
   Two similar, but different, approaches have been taken in order to
   obtain a likely land use pattern for the 2020s. The first is based on a
   simple but realistic assumption that the `2 km grid squares' where
   `settlement' is the second largest type of land use will be predominated
   by `settlement' in about 35 years. This assumption has been justified by
   comparison of the data for c. 1950 and 1985. In fact, the validity of
   the model has been tested, and proved to be highly relevant. Another
   model assumes that settlement expansion occurs so as to ease high
   population density in settlements, and that it affects other types of
   land use. A general land use map for the 2020s has been produced based
   on these and other assumptions. The distribution of urbanized areas
   resembles that obtained by the first model. It is noted that paddy-field
   is the largest type of land use that suffers from urban expansion in the
   coming two to three decades in central Japan. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{We monitored the land use changes in a hilly area of West Lampung, South
   Sumatra, Indonesia, from 1970 to 1990. The main data sources were the
   land use maps produced in 1970, 1978, 1984 and 1990 covering the area of
   27 km x 27 km. Transmigration and the resultant effect of increased
   population were the major driving forces in land use changes.
   Fifty-seven per cent of the study area was covered with primary forests
   in 1970, but only 13\% in 1990. Areas under plantations, which were
   absent in 1970, increased to 60\% in 1990. In addition, the change from
   monoculture plantations (mostly coffee plantation) to mixed plantations
   was noticeable from 1984 to 1990. Total upland areas including upland
   areas under shifting cultivation and upland fields with crops and
   vegetables decreased from 21\% in 1970 to 0.1\% in 1990. Soil chemical
   properties (total organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable
   cations, cation exchangeable capacity (CEC), etc.) were analysed for
   lands under different land use forms after deforestation in the study
   area. Soil samples (surface layers, 0-20 cm, and subsurface layers,
   20-40 cm) were collected from three different locations, each comprised
   of four different land use systems: i.e. primary forests, secondary
   forests, coffee plantations and cultivated lands. The contents of total
   organic C, total N, available P, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC
   decreased significantly with land use change from primary forests to the
   other land use forms. Cultivated lands exhibited the lowest values.
   Although less remarkable than in the surface layers, the amounts of
   total organic C, total N, total P, exchangeable cations and CEC were
   also decreased by forest clearing in the subsurface layers.
   Based on the land use changes from 1978 in the study area and the
   deterioration of soil chemical properties by forest clearing, total
   decreases in the amounts of nutrients in the surface and subsurface
   layers were estimated. The land use changes were estimated to have
   decreased the total amounts of total organic C, total N, available P,
   total P, exchangeable cations and CEC by 2-9\% in 1984 and by 2-15\% in
   1990 in the surface layers, and by 1-6\%\% in 1984 and by 2-9\% in 1990
   in the subsurface layers from the levels in 1978, respectively. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The forest cover in the hill country river catchment areas of Sri Lanka
   has been reduced to isolated patches on hilltops and a handful of
   reserves above the 1524 m (5000 ft) contour. Most of the land that was
   under forest cover at the turn of the nineteenth century is now covered
   with plantation crops. The districts of Kandy, Matale, Nuwara Eliya,
   Badulla, Ratnapura and Kegalle are the main hill country plantation
   areas. Within a period of less than half a century most of the forests
   in the hill country were cleared for plantation crops. Shifting
   cultivation was responsible for deforestation in the drier parts of the
   hill country. At the time of the British conquest of the hill country,
   the population of the whole island was not more than 3/4 to 1 million
   and they had settled in isolated villages at elevations below 1066 m.
   Subsistence agriculture was the main occupation of this predominantly
   rural population.
   During the first phase (1830-1880) of the plantation industry, large
   tracts of mostly forest land were cleared for coffee cultivation. By
   1878, the extent of the coffee plantations reached its maximum of 111
   336 ha most of which was situated in the wet zone hill country. The
   second phase of plantation agriculture began as the coffee industry was
   completely wiped out by a leaf disease. Most of the abandoned coffee
   plantations and the remaining forests were converted to tea, rubber and
   cinchona estates. The first two crops managed to survive price
   fluctuations in the world market, while the latter collapsed because of
   over production.
   During the period of large-scale deforestation in the hill country, the
   climate also underwent changes as exemplified by rainfall and
   temperature trends. However, these trends are not uniform everywhere in
   the plantation areas of the hill country. The temperature has risen a
   few degrees over a period of about a century and quarter in the hill
   country stations, while rainfall has declined significantly at some
   stations. These changes seem to be a result of the interaction of both
   global and local factors. Although some of these changes would have been
   a result of global warming, land use change would also have contributed
   to regional disparities. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Runoff and soil erosion, based upon plot studies, have been reviewed for
   southern China. They reveal, with the exception of tree crops, no strong
   association for a given land use between runoff and erosion. The data
   support the concept of vegetation as a major control upon runoff and
   sediment production. Forest and woodland have an average erosion rate of
   0.05 t ha(-1) year(-1); the lowest rate for a given cover. Tree crops
   experience a slightly higher erosion rate followed by a scrub-grass
   cover. Cultivated slopes and bare soil, with respective mean erosion
   rates of 62.4 and 153.0 t ha(-1) year(-1), experience the greatest
   erosion. In terms of runoff production the ranking (low to high) goes
   from forest-woodland, scrub-grass to tree crops and bare to cultivated
   slopes. Sediment yield and runoff under various ground covers are
   presented as a ratio to those obtained under forest and this underlines
   the influence of land use. Further support is given by the use of
   additional studies from South-east Asia and Tanzania. Variability of
   sediment production, and to a lesser extent runoff under any given land
   use or cover, is an important feature of the data. Results from a study
   in Hong Kong support the importance of ground cover in controlling
   erosion. For example, sediment yield in splash pans on two plots where
   vegetation was cut were 2.6 and 3.8 times those of the central. Two
   plots, which were burnt, had sediment catches 5.4 and 3.1 times those of
   the control. However, observations of suspended sediment levels in a
   small stream suggest no great change in sediment levels after burning,
   which raises the question of sediment delivery from slopes to channels.
   The erosion rates reported for cultivation raise the question as to how

Abstract = {{Land use describes human activities on the earth, and forms a major
   element of the terrestrial ecosystem modified by humans in the Himalayan
   region, where developmental activities are increasing rapidly to support
   the tourism infrastructure. The unprecedented growth in population is
   putting extremely high pressure on the limited land available for
   cultivation. Land use and agricultural practices have undergone drastic
   changes since the mid-1960s through the introduction of development
   programmes and the application of various newly developed techniques in
   agrosciences. An analysis of the land use as it has occurred over the
   last 70 years suggests that it and property rights in the Upper Beas
   Basin are complex and dynamic. For example, people are giving importance
   to orchards because of their high profitability. Thus, some agricultural
   land has been encroached on by orchards. In addition, wastelands are now
   being used by people for orchards, agriculture and residential and
   commercial building. Since the Upper Beas River Basin is mountainous, it
   is fragile and prone to processes like soil erosion, slope instability,
   landslides and floods. Risks from natural hazards are increasing.
   However, the state of ecohydrological responses highlight that
   human-induced ecological changes can be largely proved at the
   microwatershed level. The findings are not extended to the Himalayan
   scale. There is also an uncertain correlation between anthropogenic
   activities (deforestation) in the mountains and hazards in the plains
   such as floods. Owing to a lack of basic research, there is little
   effective information which cannot be used for long-term effective
   monitoring of ecological and hydrological responses to global change.
   Such an uncertain situation calls for integrated watershed management
   and development using geographical information systems (GISs). (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Total amounts of CH4 emission from a Sumatra rice field were in the

   chemical fertilizer (CF-plot) and those with rice straw application
   (RS-plot), respectively. Nearly the same amounts of CH, were emitted in
   the first and second half of the growth period, irrespective of rice
   straw application. The increase in the amounts of CH4 emission by rice
   straw application were from 1.3 to 1.6 times. There was no significant
   difference in the mean CH, emission rates between rainy and dry seasons.
   Rain-fed conditions decreased the CH4 emission by 27-37\% compared with
   continuously flooded conditions. Total amounts of CH4 emission from a
   rice held growing eight popular modern rice varieties in Indonesia were
   in the ranges 32.6-41.7 and 51.3-64.6 g CH4 m(-2) season(-1) for CF-and

   range 22.1 (a Typic Sulfaquent) to 53.4 (a Typic Tropohumult) g CH4

   Respective rice fields showed the specific productivity of grain

   scattered widely from 8-11 and 11.24 g CH4 kg(-1) grain for rice fields
   of volcanic ash origin to 83 and 121 g CH4 kg(-1) grain for a Sumatra

Abstract = {{The effect of changing wetland forest to sage palm plantations on
   methane gas flux and organic carbon dynamics in tropical peat soil was
   studied in the field and the laboratory using soil samples from the Feat
   Research Station, Sarawak, Malaysia. A small amount of methane was
   released from the soil surface of both the forest and plantation held,
   with no significant difference between the two sites (1.1 +/- 0.61 and
   1.39 +/- 0.82 mg CH4 m(-2) hr(-1), respectively); thus, the amount of
   methane emission from the total area of tropical peat soil was
   estimated, preliminarily, as 2.43 Tg yr(-1), contributing 0.45\% of the
   total global methane emission and 2.1\% of methane emissions from global
   natural wetland. However, large amounts of methane were accumulated in
   the deeper soil layers. Sage palm contained much less carbon as biomass,
   but lost more as the carbon dissolved in groundwater. Laboratory
   experiments showed that incorporation of rice straw into tropical peat
   soil increased methane formation significantly. Conversely, ammonium
   sulfate suppressed methane formation in tropical peat soil. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A field study was conducted to measure the fluxes of energy budget
   components above a rice canopy in Okayama, Japan, from 5 to 16 August
   1996. During this period, the canopy height was, on average, 0.72 m and
   the leaf area index was about 3.1. The study site was approximately 300
   m x 300 m, and was surrounded by similar rice fields. Our footprint
   analysis indicated that > 90\% of the measured flux (at a height of 2.2
   m above the ground) was expected from within the nearest 300 m of upwind
   area. The closure of the energy budget was examined to ensure the data
   quality. Owing to poor thermal conductivity of the heat transducers,
   soil heat fluxes were corrected for the difference in the thermal
   conductivities of the paddy soil and the transducer. Eddy covariance
   fluxes were corrected for the effects of line averaging and the sensor
   separation. Latent heat flux was further corrected for the density
   fluctuations. The magnitudes of the total corrections were not small and
   amounted to up to 20\% of the raw flux values. With these corrections
   the surface energy budget of a rice stand was closed within 1\% under
   drained conditions and 5\% under flooded conditions. The daily
   evapotranspiration (ET) rate was near the potential rate of open water
   evaporation and ranged from 4.2 to 5.8 mm d(-1). In terms of changes in
   crop water use with irrigation, no difference in ET rates was found
   between the drained and flooded conditions. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The stable isotopic composition of rain water and soil water was
   analysed and the soil surface evaporation rate was evaluated using the
   isotope value of soil water taken from a forested headwater basin in
   central Japan. Rainfall, throughfall, soil water, groundwater and
   discharge water were sampled at intervals of one month to determine the
   isotopic compositions of deuterium (D) and oxygen-18 (O-18) therein. In
   addition, tensiometric observation of soil water was performed
   continuously. The stable isotopic ratio of soil water was homogenized
   between the soil surface and a depth of 100 cm by means of active soil
   water movement above 100 cm in depth. The mean delta(18)O in deep soil
   water below a depth of 100 cm was 0.24 parts per thousand higher than
   the volume weighted mean delta(18)O in throughfall. Consequently, the
   mean evaporation rate from the soil surface was calculated as 5\% of the
   evapotranspiration rate using the difference between the delta(18)O in
   throughfall and in deep soil water, based on the Rayleigh equation under
   equilibrium condition. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal changes in the radiation budget and soil heat flux of a forest
   floor were measured in a mixed forest located in Kyoto, Japan. The basal
   area at breast height in the survey forest was about 15.82 m(2) ha(-1),
   for evergreen trees, and 12.46 m(2) ha(-1), for deciduous trees. The sky
   view factor was 16 and 22\% at the survey site in the foliate and
   defoliate seasons, respectively. The small difference between the sky
   view factor in the two seasons was reflected in the seasonal change in
   the radiation budget of the forest floor. Namely, the net long-wave
   radiation changed rapidly in leafing and falling days, and the rate of
   net short-wave radiation was highest in April. The distinctive
   characteristic of the radiation budget was that the rates of available
   radiation in the daytime and at night were almost equal in September and
   October. Latent heat flux at the forest floor was estimated to be around
   94 MJ m(-2) annually, from our measurement with the simulation model.

Abstract = {{Knowledge of regional roughness parameters is needed for remote sensing
   and large-scale modelling purposes. The presently available estimates of
   the most problematic parameter, namely the regional thermal roughness
   length (z(0t)), have mostly been determined for dry areas and are often
   contradictory with each other. In this study, radiosonde measurements of
   temperature profiles within the atmospheric boundary layer were carried
   out at Marsta (10 km north of Uppsala in Sweden), and local sensible
   heat flux and radiometric surface temperature data were collected at the
   same site over barley and at the Norunda forest site. Regional fluxes
   and surface temperatures were calculated as weighted means by assuming
   the measured fluxes and surface temperatures at the barley and forest
   stations, respectively, represent all fields and forests within the
   studied region. Atmospheric surface layer equations were fitted with the
   radiosonde temperature profiles in a mean height range of 40 to 120 m.
   The average logarithmic ratio In(z(0u)/z(0t)) was found to be about 1.5
   for the representative 10 km upwind area. This value is much lower than
   has been reported earlier for various region-scale studies. As the
   region comprised a large amount of forests (up to 50\%), the regional
   z(0t) was closer to the larger local value of z(0t) for forest than to
   the smaller value of z(0t) found for barley. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Aggregation rules for determining mesoscale representative land surface
   parameters from their patch-scale counterparts have been suggested from
   previous geld work over the last decade. A selected number of these
   rules are tested using field data collected in the framework of HEIFE
   (Heihe River Basin Field Experiment on Land Surface Processes,
   1990-1993, China). Data from the stations of the Zhangye, Linze, Gobi
   and sand deserts have been used. Surface albedo and surface roughness
   for these four patches were aggregated in a relatively simple manner and
   the results match the physical expectations. The aggregation rules for
   surface resistance to evaporation, however, gave strongly diverging
   predictions (min. 277 to max. 5356 s m(-1)). Comparing with remote
   sensing date, which comprise a full natural variability of land surface
   types, revealed that area effective values for surface albedo, surface
   emissivity and surface roughness for the momentum obtained from the four
   patches were similar to the values obtained from the distributed remote
   sensing estimations and aggregation rules. The remote sensing algorithm
   SEBAL provides distributed estimates of vertical temperature and vapour
   pressure differences in association with the sensible and latent heat
   fluxes. Applying area average, flux matching schemes,
   area-representative values for aerodynamic and surface resistance were
   obtained. Because of the mathematical flux matching, the representative
   value for the areal surface roughness length for heat transport in HEIFE
   is three times larger than for momentum transport. It is demonstrated
   that, instead of four patches, the area-representative surface
   resistance and the surface roughness for heat transport need to be
   derived from a full spectrum of their component values, i.e. the full
   natural variability in the heterogeneous terrain should be understood.

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were conducted to study the properties of
   roughness parameters over surfaces with small-scale heterogeneity, using
   a wind tunnel fitted with an underlying weighting lysimeter packed with
   uniform fine sand. Either small columns or sand ridges were distributed
   homogeneously or non-homogeneously on the surface as roughness
   obstacles. The roughness lengths for momentum (z(0m)), heat (z(0h)) and
   vapour (z(0v)) were estimated for each surface by fitting the Aux
   profile equations to the mean profiles observed. The flow over a
   non-homogeneous rough surface was observed to become homogeneous above a
   certain height, so that `effective' parameters can be found to describe
   the average surface fluxes from the non-homogeneous surface. The
   roughness properties of the non-homogeneous surfaces are, in general,
   similar to those of homogeneous surfaces. The `effective' parameter
   values, however, suggest that the surface non-homogeneity which is a
   perturbation part of the obstacle distribution has a significant effect
   on roughness properties, and that the `effective' roughness of a
   non-homogeneous surface is always considerably greater than the actual
   average roughness. The values of z(0m) for the non-homogeneous surfaces
   are significantly greater than scaler roughness lengths (z(0h) and
   z(0v)) Though homogeneous rough surfaces also have z(0m)/z(0m) and
   z(0m)/z(0v)) ratios of greater than unity, these ratio values for
   non-homogeneous surfaces are found to be almost one order of magnitude
   greater than those for homogeneous surfaces, even when the homogeneous
   and the non-homogeneous surfaces have the same average roughness. (C)

Abstract = {{Energy budgets were measured at Arctic tundra ecosystems in Alaska, USA.
   Measurements were carried out over coastal tundra at Prudhoe Bay in
   1994, and at wet sedge, moist and dry tussock tundra around Happy Valley
   in 1995. Sensible heat flux, H, and latent heat flux, lE, were
   determined by an eddy correlation technique.
   Over the Arctic coastal tundra, the energy partition changed remarkably
   as a result of air mass conditions. Under cold and humid wild (onshore)
   from the Arctic Ocean, the temperature gradient over the tundra
   ecosystem increased, which resulted in a high level of H. Under warm and
   dry air mass on clear days from the inland tundra (offshore), air and
   soil temperatures and the water vapour deficit increased, which resulted
   in an increase in lE. The same effect or air mass condition on energy
   partition was observed at the tundra ecosystem in Happy Valley located
   135 km inland from the Arctic coast. The energy budget at wet sedge
   tundra was characterized as the heat storage within the water layer on a
   daily basis, which was partitioned mainly to lE in daytime and lE and H
   at night. Latent heat flux, lE, was largest at wet sedge tundra and
   lowest at dry tussock tundra. The Bowen ratio decreased with air
   temperature over wet sedge and dry tussock tundra ecosystems. The
   aerodynamic resistance r(a), and canopy resistance, r(c), over the wet
   sedge tundra at Happy Valley had different levels over four major wind
   directions. These levels decreased with increase in wind speed. r(a) was
   slightly higher than over other vegetation, which seemed to be owing to
   a relatively lower wind speed, while the canopy resistance r(c) was
   lower than over other vegetation.
   Global warming will affect the energy partition of the Arctic tundra
   ecosystem, and the warming and drying climate will increase the lE of
   tundra, especially in flooded areas. Expanding dry tundra increases H
   rather than lE, which enhances the warming of the tundra ecosystem. (C)

Abstract = {{Evaporation from bare soil proceeds in three stages as the soil surface
   dries. The formation of a dry surface layer (DSL), where water moves
   only in the vapour phase, is the most remarkable and symbolic feature of
   the last stage, and the following phenomena, observed recently, seem to
   be closely related to it: (a) humidity inversion across the soil
   surface. Water vapour density increases sharply from just under the dry
   surface to just above it in the daytime on fine days; (b) humidity
   inversion in the surface boundary layer. The mixing ratio of water
   vapour increases with height, at least, in the 1 to 20 m layer in desert
   areas on fine days; (c) counter-gradient flow of water vapour.
   Evaporation occurs from soil with a dry surface under the humidity
   inversion conditions, so that water vapour is transported against its
   density gradient near the surface in the daytime on fine days. A
   hypothesis is proposed to explain these phenomena, such that hot, dry
   soil surfaces produce dry air, or the humidity inversion and make the
   water vapour moving upwards in the DSL go through the surface against
   its density gradient by thermal diffusion. The hot, dry air which is
   made and trapped in the uppermost soil pores can stay there under moist
   boundary air layers with lower temperatures. When instability occurs,
   however, the trapped hot, dry air bursts out like jets and the humidity
   inversion across the surface is transported upwards by convection, by
   which means humidity inversions ale made and kept in the surface
   boundary layer. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In order to re-examine the process of bare soil evaporation, field
   observations and numerical experiments were carried out. Vertical
   distributions of water content, temperature and humidity were measured
   with a lysimeter in which fine sand was uniformly packed under field
   conditions. Numerical experiments were conducted by using a high
   resolution model of coupled water and heat flow for three example soils
   under constant or diurnally varying atmospheric conditions. Comparison
   between the results of the field observation and the numerical
   experiments revealed that evaporation can actually take place beneath
   the soil surface, mainly at the bottom boundary of the dry surface layer
   (DSL). In addition, the results of numerical experiments under different
   experimental conditions indicated that the thickness of the evaporation
   zone located at the bottom boundary of the DSL depends on the hydraulic
   properties of the soil, and that evaporation can also take place
   transiently within the DSL under varying atmospheric conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{Ground surface temperature and subsurface heat flux following forest
   removal for agricultural development have been estimated using
   temperature-depth profiles measured in the Collie River Basin, Western
   Australia. Temperature measurements have been done in water filled
   piezometer tubes to depths of 30-50 m, 19 years after forest removal and
   the establishment of annual pasture and cereal crops in areas of about
   100 ha. Two parameters, change in average surface temperature and
   thermal diffusivity of the strata, were estimated by optimization to
   minimize the deviation of predicted from observed temperature-depth
   profiles. The increases in average annual temperatures for the ground
   surface 19 years after tree removal were estimated to be 3.4, 3.8 and
   4.1 degrees C in Wights, Dens and Lemon catchments with average rainfall
   of 1120, 800 and 820 mm yr(-1) respectively. The estimated increase in
   ground surface temperature in a 1 ha area where forest was partially
   removed in Wights catchment was 2.2 degrees C, and in 15 ha of
   agriculturally developed area cleared to parkland (trees at 20 m
   spacing) in Dens catchment the increase was 1.6 degrees C. Subsurface
   heat fluxes between the ground surface and 1 m depth are predicted to
   become positive (upward) again 208 years after forest removal in Wights
   catchment and 46 years after parkland forest removal in Dens catchment.

Abstract = {{One objective of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme is to
   provide a scientific basis for sustainable development policies. Land
   use change and ecohydrology are important components of this scientific
   basis, but predicting change is difficult because of the scale and
   complexity of the interactions between non-linear ecohydrological and
   socio-economic processes at different spatial and temporal scales. A
   systems framework, the Ecosystem Approach, has been developed to
   conceptualize these interactions for the purpose of providing
   information for sustainable development policy. The Ecosystem Approach
   combines the dynamics of the Holling figure-eight model - a conceptual
   model of dynamics that stresses discontinuous change and destruction as
   an internal property of the system - and the properties of
   self-organizing systems with the socio political aspects of decision
   making.
   The Ecosystem Approach highlights the problems of managing change in
   complex systems when that change may involve unpredictable shifts to a
   different attractor. Although there are methods available to detect the
   occurrence of such shifts, both detection and modelling are complicated
   by the presence of semi-stable attractors. When a model or an ecosystem
   is on a semi-stable attractor, it may appear to remain stable for an
   extended period prior to changing as a consequence of inherent
   instabilities. When the shift to a new attractor occurs, it is quite
   sudden and unpredictable. A technical discussion on prediction under
   conditions of semistability and chaos is included because it enhances
   our understanding of the role of surprise in ecosystems, as well as the
   utility of simulation models.
   The principles of the Ecosystem Approach are derived from the
   theoretical discussion and an example of a land use policy in the Huron
   Natural Area in south-western Ontario. These principles provide a clear
   role for scientific research, and particularly simulation modelling,
   within the larger context of policy and land use management. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Large quantities of sediments leave the Himalaya through its rivers.
   These rivers are charged with sediments depending on the types of land
   use in the watersheds. Land use/cover change and hydrology was studied
   in a watershed in the Sikkim Himalaya. The land use change from forest
   and agroforestry to open agriculture has increased by 11\% from 1988 to
   1992. During the same period substantial areas of dense mixed forests
   have been converted to open mixed and degraded forests as a result of
   high pressure on natural resources. Stream flow was highest in the rainy
   season and lowest in summer season in all the streams and all the three
   years (1994-1997) of the study. The water quality of streams from
   different microwatersheds varied significantly between seasons and
   streams. Sediment and nutrient loss was estimated in microwatersheds and
   soil loss from the total watershed ranged from 4.18 to 8.82 t ha(-1)
   yr(-1) during the three-year period of study. The annual total nitrogen
   loss estimated at the watershed outlet was at a rate of 33 kg ha(-1),
   organic carbon 267 kg ha(-1) and total phosphorus 5 kg ha(-1). This
   study suggests that the upland microwatersheds can be hydroecologically
   sustainable only if good forest cover and dense forests with large
   cardamom-based agroforestry are maintained. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Changing land surface types may have important consequences for the
   climate system. Predicting even the local, immediate effects of changing
   land surface types on the local energy and water balance has been
   difficult, because the land surface parameterization schemes used
   previously in climate models have been inadequate and the resolution of
   GCMs (global circulation models) has been too coarse to describe
   mesoscale forcings such as vegetation gradient adequately and to yield
   accurate regional climate detail. Grassland is a major ecosystem in
   northern China, playing a crucial role in the surface energy and water
   budget. Inclusion of a biosphere and atmosphere transfer scheme (BATS)
   into the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) regional
   climate model (RegCM) permits an exploratory study of the possible
   effects of land cover change. Based on the observation of
   desertification processes in this area, an experiment with seven-day
   integration was designed in which all of the grassland in northern China
   is replaced by desert. The results show that, with the conversion of
   grassland into the desert, the surface hydrological cycle over northern
   China is weakened, with less precipitation and, in particular, a
   reduction in evaporation; the surface heat budget also changes,
   especially with the reduction in latent heat flux being much more than
   the reduction of net radiation, which results in an increase in surface
   temperature. These results are relevant to changes of parameters in BATS
   owing to changing land surface. Some detailed patterns of the effects of
   changing land surface on local energy and water balance have been
   simulated. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The principal geological periods from 19 to 37 Ma correspond to events
   during which the solar system crossed the spiral galactic streams of
   matter. The boundary of the Quaternary (1.5 Ma BP) was forming during
   the intersection of the arm of Orion-Cygnus with the solar system
   (2.7-0.7 Ma). There is a stable cooling trend and Matuyama-reversed
   epoch at that time. Oscillations with periods (T-J = 0.75 2(J/16)y)
   under 2 Ma have been formed inside the solar system. The structure of
   rhythms with 16 periods in an octave has determined the cosmic, solar,
   and terrestrial processes. The laws of conservation of momentum create
   spectra: A(J) = alpha(S)T(J)(2), where A(J) is amplitude and alpha(S) is
   the constant for a series of cycles. These regularities, which. are very
   convenient for classifying cycles and land forms, permit estimation of
   the time of formation of geomorphological objects. Reconstructions for
   the last glacial period, and approximation and extrapolation of the last
   homogeneous part of the row, allow enhancement of the interpretation of
   the isotope series. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of increasing spatial and temporal
   resolutions on modelled distributions of snow water equivalence (SWE)
   and snowmelt in the Emerald Lake Watershed (ELW) of the Sierra Nevada of
   California, USA. We used a coupled remote sensing/distributed energy
   balance snowmelt model (SNODIS), and used previously validated results
   from a high spatial (30 m) and temporal (hourly) resolution model run in
   ELW as a control. We selected spatial resolutions that are commensurate
   with standard product DEMs (digital elevation models) or with existing
   or planned satellite remote sensing data, and temporal resolutions that
   are factors of typical operational intervals for meteorological data, We
   degraded the spatial resolution of the DEM from 30 m to 90, 250 and 500
   m prior to computing the distributed micrometeorological data. We
   degraded the classified remote sensing data to the same spatial
   resolutions prior to computing the duration of the snow cover.
   Similarly, we degraded the temporal resolution of the
   micrometeorological data from I h to 3 and 6 h prior to computing the
   distributed energy balance and snowmelt. We compared mean basin SWE,
   basin snowpack water volume and the spatial patterns of SWE from each
   test with our previous, high resolution results. We found no significant
   differences between the mean basin-wide SWE computed from the 250 m and
   500 m spatial resolutions and that of our high resolution control,
   regardless of temporal resolution. At each temporal resolution mean
   basin SWE was overestimated at the 90 m resolution by 14-17\%,
   Coarsening of the spatial resolution did result in a loss of explicit
   information regarding the location of SWE in the basin, as expected. We
   discuss these results in terms of their implications for applying the
   SNODIS model to larger regions. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The interactive multisensor snow and ice mapping system (IMS) was
   developed to give snow and ice analysts the tools, on one platform, to
   inspect visually the imagery and mapped data from various sensor sources
   to determine the presence of snow and ice and to depict snow- and
   ice-covered areas on a map on a daily basis, in one hour or less. Snow
   and ice analysts in the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and
   Information Service have been creating weekly maps showing the extent of
   snow cover for the Northern Hemisphere since 1966 using visible imagery
   from polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites and surface
   observations as data sources. The current process is mostly manual and
   time-consuming, taking up to 10 hours to produce a map during the snow
   season. Where cloud cover precludes an unobstructed view of an area
   during the entire week, the analysis from the previous week is carried
   forward. Each week the analyst draws a new map by hand, then digitizes
   the extent of snow and ice cover using an 89 x 89 line grid overlaid on
   a stereographic map of the Northern Hemisphere. The hand-drawn map is
   photocopied and distributed and the digitized map is saved to a file for
   use in National Weather Service numerical models and for archival
   storage. IMS was designed and built to replace and improve this process
   by producing a more accurate and timely product. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The spring landscape of the Arctic tundra is dominated by a snow cover
   which is highly variable in depth owing to redistribution by wind.
   Because of different energy dynamics, this heterogeneous land cover
   produces a horizontal transfer of energy at a small scale, a process
   termed local advection. An advection efficiency term (F-s), which
   represents the fraction of the sensible heat from snow-free patches
   which is advected to snow patches, was determined from field studies and
   published model results. Energy balance calculations demonstrated the
   strong contrast between the two surface cover types that drive advective
   processes, and F-s was found to decrease exponentially with decreasing
   snow cover fraction. The field results suggest higher values of F-s
   compared with the model results for single snow patches of varying size,
   but similar in magnitude to F-s for multiple small snow patches.
   Utilizing exponential best-fit relationships between F-s and fractional
   snow cover shows an increase in sensible heat flux of over 100\% for low
   snow cover fractions. When considering the average flux over a composite
   snow and snow-free surface, the average sensible heat flux obtained from
   weighting the fluxes for each surface by their respective areas
   underestimates the composite flux when compared with when advection is
   considered.
   This work provides a simple method to estimate the effect of local
   advection on sensible heat to snow patches and the average flux from a
   composite surface during the snowmelt period, using only fluxes
   calculated independently for 0\% snow cover and 100\% snow cover and an
   estimate of F-s. It demonstrates a good first estimate of the role of
   advection, but for future study the influence of wind speed, patch
   distribution patterns and fetch lengths needs to be considered more
   explicitly. This has important implications in studies of areal energy
   fluctuations over melting, patchy snow covers, basin water balance
   studies and regional and global climate modelling. (C) 1998 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Snow has an important role in the energy balance and hydrology of boreal
   forests, but general circulation models (GCMs) have so far had to use
   very simple representations of forests and snow cover in simulations of
   climate and climate change. Results are shown from a comparison between
   heat fluxes measured over a coniferous canopy and simulated by the land
   surface scheme used in the Hadley Centre GCM. Simulated sensible and
   latent heat fluxes are found to be highly sensitive to the assumed
   distribution of snow between the canopy and the ground. This sensitivity
   is reduced, but remains large, when the surface scheme is coupled to an

Abstract = {{A warm, very wet Pacific storm caused significant flooding in the
   Pacific Northwest during February 1996. Rapid melting of the mountain
   snow cover contributed to this flooding. An energy balance snowmelt
   model is used to simulate snowmelt processes during this event in the
   Central Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Data from paired open and forested
   experimental sites at locations at and just below the Pacific Crest were
   used to drive the model, The event was preceded by cold, stormy
   conditions that developed a significant snow cover down to elevations as
   low as 500 m in the Oregon Cascades. At the start of the storm, the
   depth of the snow cover at the high site (1142 m) was 1.97 m with a snow
   water equivalent (SWE) of 425 mm, while at the mid-site (968 m) the snow
   cover was 1.14 m with a SWE of 264 mm. During the 5-6 day period of the
   storm the open high site received 349 mm of rain, lost 291 mm of SWE and
   generated 640 mm of runoff, leaving only 0.22 m of snow on the ground.
   The mid-site received 410 mm of rain, lost 264 mm of SWE to melt and
   generated 674 mm of runoff, completely depleting the snow cover.
   Simulations at adjacent forested sites showed significantly less
   snowmelt during the event. The snow cover under the mature forest at the
   high site lost only 44 mm of SWE during the event, generating 396 mm of
   runoff and leaving 0.69 m of snow. The model accurately simulated both
   snow cover depth and SWE during the development of the snow cover prior
   to the storm, and the depletion of the snow cover during the event. This
   analysis shows that because of the high temperature, humidity and
   relatively high winds in the open sites during the storm, 60-90\% of the
   energy for snowmelt came from sensible and latent heat exchanges.
   Because the antecedent conditions extended the snow cover to very low
   elevations in the basin, snowmelt generated by condensation during the
   event made a significant contribution to the flood. Lower wind speeds
   beneath the forest canopy during the storm reduced the magnitude of the
   turbulent exchanges at the snow surface, so the contribution of snowmelt
   to the runoff from forested areas was significantly less, This
   experiment shows the sensitivity of snowmelt processes to both climate
   and land cover, and illustrates how the forest canopy is coupled to the
   hydrological cycle in mountainous areas. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Ice-induced backwater has been shown to be the only method by which
   flooding has supplied water to perched basins within the Peace-Athabasca
   Delta, one of the world's largest freshwater deltas. The frequency of
   such events, however, markedly declined in the mid-1970s, To explain
   this shift, various hydrometeorological conditions that control the
   severity of river ice break-up were analysed. Specific emphasis was
   placed on the roles of flow regulation and climate variability. Flow
   regulation seems to have produced only minor changes in factors such as
   ice thickness and strength, and not to have reduced the flow at the time
   of break-up. Moreover, regulation has actually led to an increase in
   spring flow originating from the headwater region. Since the mid-1970s,
   however, spring runoff has declined in the downstream portions of the
   basin unaffected by regulation. This has been linked to a decrease in
   the magnitude of the winter snowpack, Elevated ice levels and winter
   flows resulting from regulation have further reduced the potential of
   tributary runoff to produce severe break-up floods. Thus the absence of
   a high-order event between 1974 and 1992 seems to be related to a
   combined effect of flow regulation and the vagaries of climate. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Snow accumulation and ablation processes are particularly important to
   the hydrology of cold climate forests. In order to calculate the
   distribution of snow cover and the loss of snow to sublimation, the
   amount of snowfall intercepted by forest canopies must be determined.
   This paper introduces a physically-based snowfall interception model
   that scales snowfall interception processes from branch to canopy.
   Previous models of snow interception have neglected the persistent
   presence and subsequent unloading of intercepted snow in cold climates
   and hence have only been applicable to regions where snow is quickly
   lost from the canopy. To investigate how snow is intercepted at the
   forest stand scale, measurements of wind speed, air temperature, above-
   and below-canopy snowfall, accumulation of snow on the ground and the
   load of snow intercepted by a suspended, weighed, full-size conifer were
   collected from spruce and pine stands in the southern boreal forest.
   These data show that interception increases at a declining rate with
   increasing snowfall, to a point where the intercepted load overcomes the
   strength of branches to support it. Leaf area, tree species and initial
   canopy snow load determine the snow storage capacity of the canopy.
   These factors, canopy coverage and snowfall are used to calculate snow
   interception, presuming an exponential decay in incremental interception
   as cumulative snowfall increases. The subsequent unloading of
   intercepted snow is additionally modelled as an exponential function of
   time. The sensitivity of the combined model to temperature, wind speed,
   snowfall, snow load and canopy structure is examined for weekly
   time-steps. The examination shows that interception efficiency is
   particularly sensitive to snowfall amount, canopy density and time since
   snowfall. A comparison of the model with weekly measurements of snow
   interception suggests that the method can be used to calculate snow
   interception successfully in a physically-based manner. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{Studies have related changes in snow albedo to snow crystal structure
   and to the presence of surface debris (i.e, pine needles), but there has
   been less attention given to the existence of algae in snow. An increase
   in the number of snow algae could also decrease albedo and increase
   snowmelt rates. The primary purpose of this paper is to document how
   solar irradiance serves to control the developing stages of algae in
   snow. Snow algae do not appear near the surface until there is meltwater
   in the snowpack. Low levels of solar irradiance penetrate through the
   snowpack and germinate snow algal resting stages that lie underneath,
   and snow algal growth is enhanced by available gases and nutrients.
   Flagellate cells swim through the snowpack in the meltwater around the
   snow crystals, and cells are positioned according to irradiance and
   spectral differences. In this study, Chloromonas sp.-D strains 582C and
   582D, isolated from the upper 20 cm of snowpacks in the Tughill Plateau,
   Whetstone Gulf State Park, NY, were used to investigate mating
   strategies under different irradiance levels and spectral compositions
   in the laboratory, and the irradiance levels used in the experiments
   correlated with those recorded from the upper 20 cm of snow. Using
   similar irradiance levels, blue light regimes produced more matings than
   green and red light regimes. There were no trends in mating when
   comparing green and red light regimes. When red light regimes of higher
   photon irradiance (85 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) were compared with those of
   blue light regimes of lower irradiance (30 mu mol m-2 s(-1)), more
   mating occurred under red light. A photon irradiance of 95 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1) {[}photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 400-700 nm]
   produced the most mating under both wide-spectrum (WS) and cool-white
   (CW) regimes, but more mating occurred under CW in all irradiances
   tested. Mating pairs of three types were observed: oblong-oblong (o-o),
   oblong-sphere (o-s) and sphere-sphere (s-s). Cell packs that produced
   mating types and o-o mating pairs diminished through the eight-hour time
   duration of the experiments. However, o-s and s-s mating pairs peaked at
   six to seven hours after the experiments began, while quadriflagellate
   zygotes produced from the mating pairs continued to increase throughout
   the eight hours. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Applications of snowmelt models in Canada's north have been limited
   largely to energy balance models concentrating on micro scale studies or
   macroscale applications. The latter rely solely on basin-wide, optimized
   parameters for hydrological simulation and often neglect some of the
   major physical processes controlling melt production. Although
   physically realistic models can be implemented at the
   micrometeorological scale, the data requirements are often too numerous
   to make these types of models practical to apply at the meso- or
   macroscales. On the other hand, the standard lumped model approach often
   oversimplifies the physical processes and fails to reveal subtle
   differences between land cover types and their specific response to
   meteorological inputs. This paper focuses on the use of indexed snowmelt
   algorithms derived for individual land cover component characteristics
   of the wetland dominated region of the lower Liard River Valley, NWT,
   Canada. These algorithms use an hourly temperature index and a
   combination radiation-temperature index approach to estimate snowmelt
   within the different land cover types. The algorithms developed are
   incorporated into a fully distributed hydrological model (SPL7) that
   uses the grouped response unit (GRU) method for basin discretization.
   Snowmelt indices are estimated for both approaches using snow cover
   depletion data obtained during an extensive field campaign. The indices
   are then validated using historical data from complementary studies.
   Results show that the radiation-temperature algorithm provided slightly
   improved calibration results; however, both algorithms validated equally
   well. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The combined influence of increased temperatures and changed
   precipitation on the seasonal snow cover and runoff is evaluated for the
   Upper Rhine Basin at Felsberg (3250 km(2), 560-3614 m a.s.l.). The
   runoff regime reflects the snow accumulation in the winter half-year and
   snowmelt in the summer half-year. The method of predicting future runoff
   regimes is based on high resolution periodical snow cover mapping by
   satellites. The snow coverage is the main input variable for the
   snowmelt runoff model SRM-ETH (version of the Institute of Technology
   ETH). The model computes the present runoff and the climate-affected
   snow-covered areas, from which it computes the future runoff. Conditions
   of the present climate are represented by a normalized year. Snow
   conditions and yearly hydrographs are evaluated for the years 2030 and
   2100 according to the given climate scenarios for this region.
   Quantitative results indicate the decrease of the snow accumulation on 1
   April as well as the seasonal redistribution and changes of runoff. (C)

Abstract = {{Spatial variability in snow accumulation and melt owing to topographic
   effects on solar radiation, snow drifting, air temperature and
   precipitation is important in determining the timing of snowmelt
   releases, Precipitation and temperature effects related to topography
   affect snowpack variability at large scales and are generally included
   in models of hydrology in mountainous terrain. The effects of spatial
   variability in drifting and solar input are generally included only in
   distributed models at small scales. Previous research has demonstrated
   that snowpack patterns are not well reproduced when topography and
   drifting are ignored, implying that larger scale representations that
   ignore drifting could be in error. Detailed measurements of the spatial
   distribution of snow water equivalence within a small, intensively
   studied, 26-ha watershed were used to validate a spatially distributed
   snowmelt model. These observations and model output were then compared
   to basin-averaged snowmelt rates from a single-point representation of
   the basin, a two-region representation that captures some of the
   variability in drifting and aspect and a model with distributed terrain
   but uniform drift. The model comparisons demonstrate that the lumped,
   single-point representation and distributed terrain with uniform drift
   both yielded poor simulations of the basin-averaged surface water input
   rate. The two-point representation was a slight improvement, but the
   late season melt required for the observed stream-flow was not simulated
   because the deepest drifts were not represented. These results imply
   that representing the effects of subgrid variability of snow drifting is
   equally or more important than representing subgrid variability in solar
   radiation. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Annual maxima (AM) and partial duration (PD) flood series are modelled
   by parametric and non-parametric methods. In PD analysis the number of
   threshold exceedances is assumed to be Poisson distributed; the peak
   exceedances are described by the generalized Pareto (GP) and
   non-parametric (NP) distributions. The generalized extreme value (GEV)
   and non-parametric (NP) distributions are used to describe the AM
   series. L-moments are employed for parameter estimation for GEV and GP
   distributions. Analysis of data from the provinces of Quebec and
   Ontario, Canada, shows that both AM and PD series can be inferred as
   being unimodal and bimodal, both of which can be described by the NP
   method. Also, this method is found not to be sensitive to the choice of
   threshold level; however, it was also observed that parametric methods
   cannot detect biomodality, give different quantile estimates for AM and
   PD data and PD estimates are sensitive to the selection of threshold
   level. Therefore, the NP method is more advantageous than the parametric
   methods in flood frequency analysis for both AM and PD series. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Spatial variation in snowmelt rates in the boreal forest can be
   explained by differences in canopy density. Canopy density, represented
   as gap fractions (GF), controls both the amount of short-wave radiation
   reaching the snowpack surface and wind speed over the snow surface,
   which in turn regulates sensible and latent heat fluxes, Reductions in
   shortwave, sensible and latent heat fluxes outweigh any increased
   contributions from longwave radiation from the canopy. Differences in
   the total energy available for melt do not translate to equally
   proportional changes in melt rates under different canopy densities. As
   available energy increases, the melt rate increases with decreasing
   canopy density and the form of the relationship can vary depending on
   climatic conditions. A good relationship between ground-based GF
   measurements and a canopy closure index derived from Landsat TM provides
   the spatial fabric for the distribution of snowmelt rates that show
   comparable patterns of snow ablation during years of very different
   climatological conditions. This physically meaningful method of
   determining the spatial variability of snow ablation and subsequent
   meltwater delivery to the soil interface is particularly useful for
   providing insight to the heterogeneous active layer development in
   permafrost regions of the boreal forest and the implications for runoff
   processes. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{MODIS, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer, will be
   launched in 1998 as part of the first earth observing system (EOS)
   platform. Global maps of land surface properties, including snow cover,
   will be created from MODIS imagery. The MODIS snow-cover mapping
   algorithm that will be used to produce daily maps of global snow cover
   extent at 500 m resolution is currently under development. With the
   exception of cloud cover, the largest limitation to producing a global
   daily snow cover product using MODIS is the presence of a forest canopy,
   A Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) time-series of the southern Boreal
   Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) study area in Prince Albert National
   Park, Saskatchewan, was used to evaluate the performance of the current
   MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm in varying forest types. A snow
   reflectance model was used in conjunction with a canopy reflectance
   model (GeoSAIL) to model the reflectance of a snow-covered forest stand.
   Using these coupled models, the effects of varying forest type, canopy
   density, snow grain size and solar illumination geometry on the
   performance of the MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm were investigated.
   Using both the TM images and the reflectance models, two changes to the
   current MODIS snow-cover mapping algorithm are proposed that will
   improve the algorithm's classification accuracy in forested areas. The
   improvements include using the normalized difference snow index and
   normalized difference vegetation index in combination to discriminate
   better between snow-covered and snow-free forests. A minimum albedo
   threshold of 10\% in the visible wavelengths is also proposed. This will
   prevent dense forests with very low visible albedos from being
   classified incorrectly as snow. These two changes increase the amount of
   snow mapped in forests on snow-covered TM scenes, and decrease the area
   incorrectly identified as snow on non-snow-covered TM scenes. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A surface area/volume relationship was used to estimate total glacier
   volumes for the highly glacierized Hector Lake Basin (281 km(2)) in the
   Canadian Rockies in the years 1951 and 1993. The change in volume was
   calculated and this value then extrapolated up to the Bow Basin at Banff
   (2230 km(2)) based on relative proportions of glacier cover. The mean
   net glacier volume loss estimate of 934 x 10(6) m(3) was divided into
   annual proportions of glacier wastage and storage using a local mass
   balance record collected at Peyto Glacier in the Mistaya Valley,
   contiguous to the Bow Basin. Unfortunately, the record began in 1966 and
   a hind-cast to 1952 (hydrological year) was necessary. Banff maximum
   summer temperature and Lake Louise snow course data were used as
   surrogates for summer and winter glacier mass balance, respectively.
   Monthly wastage proportions were estimated for 1967-1974 by using
   modelled values of glacial melt as a template. Glacier wastage inputs to
   and storage held back from the Bow River hydrograph at Banff were
   compared with known basin yields to assess the hydrological effects of
   glacier volume change. For 1952-1993, the average annual wastage/basin
   yield ratio was found to be around 1.8\%. For the extremely low flow
   year of 1970 this ratio increased to 13\%. The proportion of flow
   derived from glacier wastage in August of this year was estimated to be
   around 56\%. Although the results tend to confirm the regulatory effect
   of glaciers on stream flow, it was found that in some years of low flow
   this situation has been aggravated by water being held in glacial
   storage. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Snow ablation modelling at the stand scale must account for the
   variability in snow cover and the large variations of components of
   energy transfer at the forest floor. Our previous work successfully
   predicted snow ablation in a mature jack pine stand by using a
   one-dimensional snow process model and models predicting radiation below
   forest canopies. This work represents a second test of our basic
   modelling scenario by predicting snow ablation in a leafless, deciduous
   aspen stand and verifying the results with field data. New modifications
   to the snow model accounted for decreased albedo owing to radiation
   penetration through optically thin snowpacks. A provisional equation
   estimates litter fall on the snowpack, thereby reducing the areal
   averaged albedo. We showed that subcanopy radiation measurements can be
   used with a canopy model to estimate a branch area index for defoliated
   aspen as an analogue to the foliage area index used for conifers.
   Modelled incoming solar and long-wave radiation showed a strong
   correlation with measurements, with r(2) = 0.95 and 0.91 for solar and
   long-wave radiation, respectively. Model results demonstrate that net
   radiation overwhelms turbulent exchanges as the most significant driving
   force for snowmelt in aspen forests. Predicted snow ablation in the
   aspen stand compared very favourably with available data on snow depth.

Abstract = {{An isotopic method is applied in conjunction with a water balance method
   and the Penman combination method to estimate evaporation from a small,
   high closure (low outflow) lake near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories,
   Canada (62 degrees 03'N 111 degrees 24'W). The study provides baseline
   hydrological information for assessment of tailings pond design and
   management at nearby mine sites, and, notably, enables intercomparison
   of several field-based evaporation methods and a standard climate
   approach in a subarctic setting. A non-steady isotope mass balance
   method is applied to estimate evaporation over time intervals ranging
   from five days to three weeks, based on isotopic surveys of lake water,
   groundwater, precipitation and atmospheric moisture during the open
   water periods of 1991 to 1996. Use of a relatively high precision
   non-steady technique, in contrast to the commonly employed approach
   assuming steady state, is feasible in the present setting owing to
   pronounced seasonal evaporative enrichment in lake water (20-30 times
   analytical uncertainty of delta(18)O), A comparative analysis reveals
   that the isotopic method is conservative relative to the Penman
   combination method, but less conservative than standard water balance,
   although estimates for the open water period are in agreement to within
   20\% in both cases. Interannual variability in evaporation is revealed
   to be 30-50\% greater than predicted from standard pan-to-lake
   algorithms, and of the same order of magnitude as the annual snow water
   equivalent (approximate to 155-175 mm), which has important implications
   for the design and management of tailings ponds in the area. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{An approach to model distributed snow water equivalence (SWE) that
   merges field measurements of depth and density with remotely sensed
   snow-covered area (SCA) is described. In 1993, two teams conducted an
   intensive snow survey in the 92.8 km(2) Blackcap Basin of the Kings
   River. Snow depth was measured at 709 points and density in five snow
   pits and along five transects using a Federal Sampler. Sample locations
   were chosen to be representative of the range of elevation, slope and
   aspect of the basin. Regression tree models showed that net radiation,
   elevation and slope angle account for 60-70\% of the variance in the
   depth measurements. Density was distributed over the basin on a 30 m
   grid with a multiple linear regression model that explained 70\% of the
   observed variance as a function of the same three variables. The gridded
   depth estimates, combined with modelled density, produced spatially
   distributed estimates of SWE. An unsupervised spectral unmixing
   algorithm estimated snow cover fractions from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper
   data acquired at the time as the snow survey. This method provides a
   snow cover fraction estimate for every pixel. This subpixel map was used
   as the best estimate for SCA and, combining it with the SWE map, allowed
   computation of the SWE volume. The estimated volume using the subpixel
   SCA map was compared with several SCA maps produced with simulations of
   binary SCA mapping techniques. Thresholds of 40, 50 and 60\% fractional
   cover were used to map binary cases of full snow cover or no snow cover.
   The difference in basin SWE volume was up to 13\% depending on the
   threshold used to classify snow-covered versus snow-free areas. The
   percentage differences in volumes show a significant correlation to the
   percentage differences in SCA between the methods. (C) 1998 John Wiley

Abstract = {{A new mathematical solution to the problem of water flow through snow is
   presented and its implementation in a snowmelt model, SNAP, is
   discussed. An analytical solution for vertical water flow through
   homogeneous snow is developed and formulae that allow the solution to
   accommodate time-varying surface input from rain or snowmelt are
   derived. This facilitates use of the technique in a computer snowmelt
   model. Because the new technique requires no matrix computation, it is
   sufficiently computationally efficient to be a candidate for use in
   watershed-scale, distributed forecasting systems. Because it is a
   physically based model that takes into account the effect of the snow
   itself on the timing and magnitude of outflow, the model allows more
   accurate prediction of the magnitude and timing of snowmelt than in
   currently employed operational models. Results of the new model agree
   well with previous theoretical solutions and with field measurements of
   melt and rain-on-snow events in a seasonal snow pack. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{The surface energy balance and near-surface weather variables were
   measured during the complete growth cycle of cotton and wheat crops
   planted in two successive seasons in 1995-1996 at a field site in the
   Yaqui Valley in Sonora, Mexico. These data were analysed in terms of a
   set of simple evapotranspiration models, which included the
   Penman-Monteith equation applied at both the hourly and daily
   time-scales and four semiempirical simplifications of that equation, The
   field data were used to investigate and specify seasonal variations in
   the surface parameters (crop coefficient or surface resistance)
   appropriate to these models. There was a marked difference between the
   effective value of surface parameters for the (cotton) row crop and the
   (wheat) continuous-cover crop during and immediately after periods of
   flood irrigation. This difference reflects the fact that wet soil and
   remnant pools of irrigation water are well exposed to the atmosphere for
   flood-irrigated row crops and that evapotranspiration rates are
   enhanced. It proved possible to incorporate a description of this
   phenomenon by including a simple, additional term in an otherwise
   traditional model of the seasonal variation in crop factor or surface
   resistance. Once the parameters in the various models had been optimized
   against field data, all the models provided reasonable descriptions of
   the measured evapotranspiration. However, the Penman-Monteith equation
   applied at the hourly time-scale performed least well and required
   greater parameterization; hence, its use in this application is not
   justified. At the daily time-scale, use of the Penman-Monteith equation
   or Shuttleworth's reference crop evaporation (with a crop factor) is
   arguably preferable to the others in that, having more realism, it
   provides a description in which the (calibrated) surface parameters are
   a purer measure of crop control, However, in terms of descriptive
   ability after local calibration, the Penman, Priestley-Taylor, and
   Makkink models proved superior in this study. The good performance of
   the Makkink formulation is particularly encouraging because this
   equation requires only incoming solar radiation, which can be readily
   estimated from remotely sensed data. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An important problem in modelling macroscale basins, especially for
   sparsely observed regions, is the lack of precipitation information.
   Alternatives to using straightforward interpolated surface observations
   include the utilization of more advanced interpolation techniques and
   the use of additional precipitation information from atmospheric models.
   Conventional and geostatistical methods are applied for optimal
   interpolation and assimilation of observed and model precipitation.
   Various time-series of daily areal precipitation distributions are
   produced and compared using not only an internal precipitation
   validation, but also an objective verification based on stream flow
   simulations. The Mackenzie River Basin in north-western Canada is used
   as the study area and hydrological simulations are carried out with the
   model SLURP. It was found that better interpolation techniques and the
   use of combined precipitation data can improve the hydrological
   simulations and that the enhancements are related to the relative size
   of the simulation units used. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial patterns of N dynamics in soil were evaluated within two small
   forested watersheds in Japan. These two watersheds were characterized by
   steep slopes (>30 degrees) and high stream NO3- drainage rates (8.4 to
   25.1 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) that were greater than bulk precipitation N
   input rates (7.5 to 13.5 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)). Higher rates of
   nitrification potential at near-stream zones were reflected in greater
   NO3- contents for soil at the near-stream zones compared with ridge
   zones. Both stream discharge rates and NO3- concentrations in deep
   unsaturated soil at the near-stream zones were positively correlated to
   NO3- concentrations in stream water. These relationships, together with
   high soil NO3- contents at the near-stream zones, suggest that the
   near-stream zone was an important source of NO3- to stream water.
   Nitrate flux from these near-stream zones was also related to the
   drainage of cations (K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+). The steep slope of the
   watersheds resulted in small saturated areas that contributed to the
   high NO3- production thigh nitrification rates) in the near-stream zone.

Abstract = {{Discharge and luminescence properties of waters feeding a flowstone in
   Lower Cave, Bristol, were measured at both three weekly and 30 minute
   sampling intervals within rainfall events over the period April
   1994-April 1995 and July-December 1995, respectively. Results are
   compared with the discharge and luminescence of lower(< 0.01 mi s(-1))
   discharge waters supplying five stalagmites in the cave (Baker ed al.,
   1997). When sampled at three weekly intervals, the flowstone waters
   exhibit a statistically significant relationship between discharge and
   luminescence intensity (r = 0.75), with luminescence maxima in late
   autumn and early winter. When compared with the stalagmite waters, the
   flowstone waters have a higher luminescence intensity at 420 nm (28 +/-
   11 vs. 12 +/- 1 luminescence units) and a higher wavelength of maximum
   luminescence intensity (430 +/- 2 vs. 419 +/- 1 nm). The relationship
   between discharge and luminescence is weaker for the flowstone than for
   the fastest dripping stalagmite waters (r = 0.75 vs. r = 0.85),
   suggesting that hysteresis and other non-linear effects on the
   luminescent fraction in the waters may be important under higher flow
   regimes (> 0.01 mi s(-1)) feeding flowstones. When 30 minute sampling
   results are considered, dilution and hysteresis effects can be observed
   in the discharge-luminescence relationship, both on an intra-event basis
   and over the winter as a whole. Exhaustion of organic matter within the
   karst groundwater system over the hydrological year may also be
   important. A very rapid flux of luminescent organic matter in early
   autumn generates a non-linear, order of magnitude change in water
   luminescence intensity. Flowstone water luminescence properties can be
   interpreted as having: (1) higher concentrations of luminescent organic
   matter compared with stalagmites (from luminescence intensity data); (2)
   a greater proportion of humic acid in relation to fulvic acid (from
   luminescence wavelength data); (3) a more rapid response to surface
   rainfall events; and (4) a consequently greater proportion of non-linear
   responses to surface rainfall variations. These results are considered
   in terms of the utility of the analysis of luminescence variations in
   solid samples of stalagmites and flowstones in aiding the reconstruction
   of past rainfall variations, and it is suggested that stalagmites are
   more useful than flowstones. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimates of N and P loads were obtained for four contrasting
   UK river basins over a complete annual cycle. The fractionation of these
   loads into dissolved and particulate, and inorganic and organic
   components allowed a detailed examination of the nutrient load
   composition and of the factors influencing both the relative and
   absolute magnitude of these components. The particulate phosphorus (TPP)
   loads account for 26-75\% of the annual total phosphorus (TP) transport
   and are predominantly inorganic. The inorganic (PIP) and organic (POP)
   fractions of the TPP loads represent 20-47\% and 6-28\% of the annual TP
   transport, respectively. In contrast, the particulate nitrogen loads
   (TPN) represent 8\% or less of the annual total nitrogen (TN) loads and
   are predominately organic. For dissolved P transport, the dissolved
   inorganic fraction (DIP) is more important, representing 15-70\% of the
   TP loads, whereas the dissolved organic fraction (DOP) represents only
   3-9\% of the TP loads. The TN loads are dominated by the dissolved
   component and more particularly the total oxidized fraction (TON), which
   is composed of nitrate and nitrite and represents 76-82\% of the annual
   TN transport. The remaining dissolved N species, ammonium (NH4-N) and
   organic N (DON) account for 03-12\% and 13-16\% of the annual TN
   transport, respectively. The TPN and TPP fluxes closely reflect the
   suspended sediment dynamics of the study basins, which are in turn
   controlled by basin size and morphology. The dissolved inorganic
   nutrient fluxes are influenced by point source inputs to the study
   basins, especially for P, although the TON flux is primarily influenced
   by diffuse source contributions and the hydrological connectivity
   between the river and its catchment area. The dissolved organic
   fractions are closely related to the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   dynamics, which are in turn influenced by land use and basin size. The
   magnitude of the NH4-N fraction was dependent on the proximity of the
   monitoring station to point source discharges, because of rapid
   nitrification within the water column. However, during storm events,
   desorption from suspended sediment may be temporarily important. Both
   the magnitude and relative contribution of the different nutrient
   fractions exhibit significant seasonal variability in response to the
   hydrological regime, sediment mobilization, the degree of dilution of
   point source inputs and biological processes. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) on suspended
   sediments during a flood event at Thwaite Mills, River Aire, were
   analysed using a five step sequential extraction technique to determine
   their major chemical associations (exchangeable, surface oxide and
   carbonate, Fe and Mn oxides, organic and residual metal ions). Total
   metal concentrations were lowest at higher discharges, resulting from
   dilution by clean sediment. The major transport fractions are the Fe and
   Mn oxides, which carry 29\% of the total metals. Knowledge of the
   chemical forms of heavy metals on suspended sediment is essential for
   estimating their biological availability and physicochemical reactivity.

Abstract = {{As mineral magnetism is used as a tracer for sourcing river and dam
   sediments, changes in the magnetic properties that may occur during
   transport between the source and sink must be considered. Abrasion and
   breakage of particles will occur during transport. These processes were
   examined in simulation experiments with a granitic and a sedimentary
   soil. The effects of these processes on the magnetic properties of a
   granitic and a sedimentary soil were examined using a simulated
   breakage/abrasion experiment. Breakage and/or abrasion had substantial
   effects on the magnetic properties of both soils. All particle sizes
   were affected, but the magnitude varied through the size range of
   derived particles. The major effect was on the concentration of magnetic
   minerals, with differences between the concentrations in particle sizes
   of the original material and those generated by the experiments being as
   much as 20 times. The effect on the granite soil was to reduce the
   concentrations, i.e. derived material was less than original material;
   whereas for the sedimentary soil the derived particles had higher
   concentrations. The effect on magnetic grain size, as indicated by the
   magnetic ratios, was less than the effect on the mass magnetic
   properties, but still substantial for some ratios for some sizes. (C)

Abstract = {{Physically based and spatially distributed modelling of catchment
   hydrology involves the estimation of block or whole-hillslope
   permeabilities. Invariably these estimates are derived by calibration
   against rainfall-runoff response. Rarely are these estimates rigorously
   compared with parameter measurements made at the small scale. This study
   uses a parametrically simple model, TOPMODEL, and an uncertainty
   framework to derive permeability at the catchment scale. The utility of
   expert knowledge of the internal catchment dynamics (i.e. extent of
   saturated area) in constraining parameter uncertainty is demonstrated.
   Model-derived estimates are then compared with core-based measurements
   of permeability appropriately up-scaled. The observed differences
   between the permeability estimates derived by the two methods might be
   attributed to the role of intermediate scale features (natural soil
   pipes). An alternative method of determining block permeabilities at the
   intermediate or hillslope scale is described. This method uses
   pulse-wave tests and explicitly incorporates the resultant effects of
   phenomena such as soil piping and kinematic wave migration. The study
   aims to highlight issues associated with parameterizing or validating
   distributed models, rather than to provide a definitive solution. The
   fact that the permeability distribution within the Borneo study
   catchment is comparatively simple, assists the comparisons. The field
   data were collected in terrain covered by equatorial rainforest.
   Combined field measurement and modelling programmes are rare within such
   environments. (C) 1998 John Wiley gr Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper will introduce the basic principles associated with hydraulic
   modelling of surface waters for geomorphological and hydrological
   purposes and illustrate how these have been applied to specific
   problems. The basic principles governing fluid flow are derived from the
   principles of conservation of mass and momentum. In the case of the
   shallow flow problems that typify most geomorphological and hydrological
   contexts, these equations involve some modifications: (i) as the
   boundary layer is likely to extend throughout the flow depth, it is
   possible to assume a hydrostatic pressure distribution; (ii) special
   conditions need to be determined for both the bottom and water surface,
   including the possibility of horizontal gradients of atmospheric
   pressure for large-scale applications, and wind stress; and (iii) it is
   generally permissible to ignore the Coriolis terms. Direct application
   of the resultant equations is complicated by the need to
   Reynolds-average, which introduces additional terms but no additional
   equations. These terms have to be determined through empirical or
   semi-empirical transport equations, usually termed turbulence models.
   Current applications of these equations to geomorphological and
   hydrological applications are reviewed. Applications to river channels
   have generally not made use of the full three-dimensional form of the
   governing equations, and have either been one-dimensional, or, more
   commonly, two-dimensional. The latter involves depth averaging of the
   governing equations but requires parameterization of the effects of
   secondary circulation upon the transport of momentum. This has
   emphasized secondary circulation generated by curvature of the
   depth-averaged streamlines, but has yet to address secondary circulation
   associated with topographic discordance at river channel confluences or
   diffluences or owing to anisotropic turbulence. Applications to unsteady
   flows require special attention to be given to the effects of spatial
   and temporal variation in the depth of inundation, and the associated
   treatments are reviewed. (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The numerical simulation of free surface flows that alternately flood
   and dry out over complex topography is a formidable task. The model
   equation set generally used for this purpose is the two-dimensional (2D)
   shallow water wave model (SWWM). Simplified forms of this system such as
   the zero inertia model (ZIM) can accommodate specific situations like
   slowly evolving floods over gentle slopes. Classical numerical
   techniques, such as finite differences (FD) and finite elements (FE),
   have been used for their integration over the last 20-30 years. Most of
   these schemes experience some kind of instability and usually fail when
   some particular domain under specific flow conditions is treated. The
   numerical instability generally manifests itself in the form of an
   unphysical negative depth that subsequently causes a run-time error at
   the computation of the celerity and/or the friction slope. The origins
   of this behaviour are diverse and may be generally attributed to:
   1. The use of a scheme that is inappropriate for such complex flow
   conditions (mixed regimes).
   2. Improper treatment of a friction source term or a large local
   curvature in topography.
   3. Mishandling of a cell that is partially wet/dry.
   In this paper, a tentative attempt has been made to gain a better
   understanding of the genesis of the instabilities, their implications
   and the limits to the proposed solutions. Frequently, the enforcement of
   robustness is made at the expense of accuracy. The need for a positive
   scheme, that is, a scheme that always predicts positive demand when run
   within the constraints of some practical stability limits, is
   fundamental. It is shown here how a carefully chosen scheme (in this
   case, an adaptation of the solver to the SWWM) can preserve positive
   values of water depth under both explicit and implicit time integration,
   high velocities and complex topography that may include dry areas.
   However, the treatment of the source terms: friction, Coriolis and
   particularly the bathymetry, are also of prime importance and must not
   be overlooked. Linearization with a combination of switching between
   explicit-implicit integration can overcome the `stiffness' of the
   friction and Coriolis terms and provide stable numerical integration.
   The treatment of the bathymetry source term is much mon delicate. For
   cells undergoing a transient wet-dry process, the imposition of zero
   velocity stabilizes most of the approximations, However, this artificial
   zero velocity condition can be the cause of considerable error,
   especially when fast moving fronts are involved. Besides these
   difficulties linked with the internal position of the front within a
   cell versus the limited resolution of a numerical grid, it appears that
   the second derivative that defines whether the bed is locally convex or
   concave is a key indicator for stability. A convex bottom may lead to
   unbounded solutions. It appears that this behaviour is not linked to the
   numerics (numerical scheme) but rather to the mathematical theory of the
   SWWM. These concerns about stability have taken precedence, until now,
   over the crucial and related question of accuracy, especially near a
   moving front, and how these possible inaccuracies at the leading edge
   may affect the solution at interior points within the domain.
   This paper presents an in depth, fully two-dimensional space analysis of
   the aforementioned problem that has not been addressed before. The
   purpose of the present communication is not to propose what could be
   viewed as a `final solution', but rather to provide some key
   considerations that may reveal the ingredients and insight necessary for
   the development of accurate and robust solutions in the future. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{A Lagrangian model for the saltation of sand in water is proposed.
   Simulated saltation trajectories neglecting particle rotation and
   turbulence effects compare fairly well with experimental observations.
   The model for particle motion is coupled with a stochastic model for
   particle collision with the bed, such that a number of realizations of
   the saltation process can be simulated numerically. Model predictions of
   mean values and standard deviations of saltation height, length and
   streamwise particle velocity agree fairly well with experimental
   observations. Model predictions of the dynamic friction coefficient are
   also in good agreement with experimental observations, but they
   underestimate the value of 0.63 proposed by Bagnold for this
   coefficient. The saltation model is applied to the estimation of bedload
   transport rates of sand using a Bagnoldean formulation. Modelled values
   of the bedload transport rates overestimate those predicted by commonly
   used bedload formulae, which appears to be a consequence of problems in
   the definition of the dynamic friction coefficient, These results seem
   to indicate a few problems with the Bagnoldean formulation, particularly
   regarding the continuum assumption for the bedload layer, which would be
   valid only for very high particle concentrations and small particle
   diameters, and also regarding the evaluation of the shear stress exerted
   on the bed by the saltating particles, (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines a physically based model developed for prediction of
   both arid region flash floods and associated transmission loss. It is
   based on coupling numerical solutions of the St Venant equations and the
   kinematic wave equation for channel and overland flow routing,
   respectively, with the Richards' equation for the determination of
   infiltration. These hydrological components are integrated in one
   comprehensive model for the above-mentioned purposes. The robustness of
   the model and its components have been tested and it has then been
   applied to a medium-size catchment in an arid region. The results
   indicate that reasonable simulations can be achieved with a minimum of
   calibration, but point to problems of representing input rainfall
   conditions with the necessary time and space resolutions. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of pollutants entering floodplain soils during
   a flood event will be controlled by the interactions between flood
   hydraulics, floodplain topography, pollutant concentration, soil
   conditions, suspended sediment size and chemical reactions between the
   pollutants, water and soil. These interactions produce spatial
   variations in pollution build-up that are difficult to sample using
   current field-based techniques. Coupled hydraulic and hydrological
   models provide an ideal framework in which to explore these interactions
   and to improve current, reach-scale, chemical budget calculations. This
   paper presents a distributed model of floodplain pollution transport
   which for the first time allows a prediction of the spatial distribution
   of deposited and infiltrated pollutants within river reaches over a
   range of scales (1-60 km). The model is shown to be able to predict many
   of the features of floodplain pollutant build-up that are observed in
   the field. Using data from hypothetical examples it is suggested that
   the model can be used in the development of site-specific field sampling
   strategies. (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional, finite element hydraulic models have been developed to
   simulate river flood flows at high spatial and temporal resolutions over
   river reach lengths of 1-60 km. Such models have been shown to be
   capable of simulating bulk flow; however, model redesign to predict
   spatially distributed hydraulic variables has been constrained by lack
   of suitable topographic and hydraulic data. Here we begin this
   development process using a hypothetical river channel/floodplain domain
   where the topographic surface is parameterized using scaling information
   derived from a fractal analysis of a real floodplain DTM. This is used
   to test the relative effect of the boundary friction calibration,
   numerical model grid resolution, topography sampling error and
   floodplain relative height on model predictions of outflow discharge,
   inundation extent and local hydraulic variables. Simulations indicate
   that model calibration is the dominant factor affecting the above three
   quantities. Moreover, model sensitivity to spatially uniform change is
   shown to be simple for bulk flow and inundation extent but spatially
   complex for local hydraulics. The study has a number of implications for
   model calibration and set-up procedures, as well as indicating the need
   to develop a new suite of analysis techniques for this class of model.

Abstract = {{This paper describes application and testing of a two-dimensional
   numerical flow model in a multi-thread reach of a proglacial stream. The
   model solves the depth-averaged form of the Navier-Stokes equations for
   open channel flow, incorporating a two-equation turbulence closure, an
   analytical correction for the effects of secondary circulation and a
   rigid lid approximation. The model requires as input the channel bed
   topography, the water surface, bed roughness and inflow discharge
   information, and predicts the spatial distribution of depth-averaged
   velocity and eddy viscosity. The results have been subjected to
   intensive testing using simple assessment of numerical performance (e.g.
   conservation of mass and momentum, numerical convergence), distributed
   sensitivity analysis and comparison of model predictions with field
   measurements of velocity. The results are encouraging, particularly
   given some of the difficulties in obtaining accurate, distributed
   cross-stream and downstream velocities. Distributed sensitivity analysis
   allowed more detailed consideration of the necessary development of the
   model. This suggested that significant errors in the velocity
   predictions were largely a result of uncertainty in the specification of
   both the magnitude and the spatial variation of bed roughness. Secondly,
   the two-equation turbulence closure was observed to have little effect
   upon model predictions, except in the vicinity of the side walls. In
   applications of models of this type to irregular, coarse-bedded
   channels, improvements in the specification of the topographic boundary
   condition specification and bed roughness are likely to be more
   important than a sophisticated turbulence closure scheme. Thirdly,
   although the secondary circulation correction was observed to reproduce
   some of the expected streamwise transfer of momentum, the effects were
   seen to be relatively small. Given the intensity of secondary
   circulation defined in field contexts, the inability of the model to
   correct effectively for the momentum transfer associated with secondary
   circulation processes related to topographic discordance and
   shear-generated turbulence suggests that further work is required in
   this respect. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Many existing numerical alluvial channel models are limited because they
   are unable to account for adjustments of channel width through time. In
   this paper, the basis for modelling width adjustment in straight river
   channels is discussed. Features and capabilities of selected models are
   discussed in terms of advances made in representing the physical
   processes and mechanisms involved in width adjustment, and in terms of
   approaches used to characterize initial and boundary conditions
   accurately. Validation and verification studies of existing width
   adjustment models are also considered. Existing models have, for the
   most part, not yet been subjected to rigorous evaluation of their
   numerical robustness, accuracy in replicating analytical solutions,
   accuracy in replicating laboratory data or their ability to simulate
   field situations. In part, these limitations reflect the lack of
   available detailed laboratory and field data sets required to evaluate
   complex models. The potential of width adjustment models for use as
   tools for the investigation of river channel dynamics is briefly
   described using two examples. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of separated flow in sharply curving river bends, and the
   associated deposition of fine-grained sediment, is widely recognized,
   but the factors controlling the existence and extent of separated flow
   have not been clearly identified. A three-dimensional, fixed lid
   computational fluid dynamics program was used to simulate time-averaged
   flow in idealized channel bends in order to investigate geometric
   controls on flow separation. The code was applied first to a field site;
   it successfully modelled the qualitative features of the flow, including
   a separation zone, and was insensitive to choice of turbulence closure
   or exclusion of lateral variation in water surface topography. The
   simulations of idealized bends demonstrate that the existence and extent
   of concave bank flow separation can be significantly influenced by
   changes in bend planform, point bar topography and upstream planform.

Abstract = {{A numerical model is presented for the prediction of floodplain
   inundation extents, flow depths and velocities, and patterns of
   suspended sediment dispersion and deposition. The model employs a
   simplified and novel treatment of fluid flow and a conventional
   convection-diffusion mass balance relationship for suspended sediment
   transport and deposition. These relationships are solved over a finite
   difference grid with a relatively fine nodal spacing, which enables a
   detailed representation of complex floodplain topography. The model is
   applied to a 600 m reach of the River Culm, Devon, UK. Continuous
   records of river stage and suspended sediment concentration monitored at
   the upstream boundary of the study reach provide the data needed to
   operate the model. These data are supplemented by measurements of the in
   situ settling characteristics of the suspended sediment load. Model
   predictions of overbank flow depths and velocities and patterns of
   suspended sediment concentrations and deposition amounts are presented.
   Predicted patterns of overbank deposition are described and compared
   with field measurements obtained with the aid of astroturf sedimentation
   traps. Grain size distributions obtained for samples of deposited
   sediment retrieved from the sedimentation traps are also examined and
   compared with model predictions. The results of both the field
   measurement programme and modelling work are shown to have significant
   implications for the representation of floodplain topography and
   suspended sediment particle size and settling properties in numerical
   simulations of overbank processes. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A bank erosion mechanism and provisions to account for the associated
   planform changes and input of bank erosion products are added to a
   two-dimensional, depth-averaged model of river morphology. The model is
   applied to a reach of the meandering gravel-bed River Ohre (Eger) in the
   former state of Czechoslovakia. The agreement with observations is poor,
   but this can be ascribed to shortcomings in the flow and bed topography
   submodels rather than to shortcomings in the bank erosion submodel.
   Better results are expected when a three-dimensional flow model,
   equations for sediment mixtures and a bank accretion mechanism are
   included. This inclusion will have to be preceded by fundamental
   research on bank accretion mechanisms and on hiding and exposure effects
   in the relationship for the influence of gravity pull on sediment

Abstract = {{Recent research into river channel confluences has identified confluence
   geometry, and particularly bed discordance, as a control on confluence
   flow structures and mixing processes, and this has been illustrated
   using both field measurements in natural confluences and laboratory
   measurements of simplified confluences. Generalization of the results
   obtained from these experiments is limited by the number of confluence
   geometries that can be examined in a reasonable amount of time. This
   limitation may be overcome by numerical models, in which confluence
   geometry is more readily varied, and data acquired more rapidly. This
   paper aims to: (i) validate the application of a three-dimensional
   numerical model to a simple confluence geometry; (ii) simulate the
   effects of different boundary condition values upon flow structures; and
   (iii) interpret the implications of these simulations for river channel
   confluence dynamics. The model used in this research solves the
   three-dimensional form of the Navier-Stokes equations and is used to
   simulate the flow in a parallel confluence of unequal depth channels and
   to investigate the effect of different combinations of velocity and
   depth ratio between the two tributaries. The results generally agree
   with empirical evidence that secondary circulation is generated in the
   absence of streamline curvature, but only for specific combinations of
   depth and velocity ratio. This research shows how understanding of the
   interaction of these controls is enhanced if pressure gradients are
   considered. The velocity ratio is the prime determinant of the
   cross-stream pressure gradient that initiates cross-stream velocities.
   However, for significant secondary circulation to form, cross-stream
   velocities must lead to significant transfer of fluid in the
   cross-stream direction. This depends on the vertical extent of the
   cross-stream pressure gradient which is controlled by the depth ratio.
   In this study, strong secondary circulation occurred for a depth
   differential of 25\% or more, as long as the velocity in the shallower
   tributary was at least as great as that in the deeper channel. This
   provides an important context for interpretation of previous work and
   for the design of new experiments in both the field and the laboratory.

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to examine a new resampling methodology
   for estimating reference levels of Cs-137 in uneroded locations.
   Accurate and precise measurement of Cs-137 is required from reference
   locations to estimate long-term (c. 40 years) sediment redistribution
   (SRD) and landscape stability. Without reliable long-term, quantitative
   erosion data it is extremely difficult for land managers to make optimal
   decisions to ensure landscape sustainability. To determine the influence
   of Cs-137 reference site sampling, particularly undersampling, on SRD
   and landscape stability, two statistical approaches were applied to a
   grid-based data set. Caesium-137 inventories in the reference location
   (n = 36) indicated that data were normally distributed, with a mean
   inventory of 2150 +/- 130 Bq m(-2) (+/- 95\% confidence band) and a
   coefficient of variation of 18\%. The two approaches used to determine
   the effect of under sampling included: (1) one-time random subsampling
   from the total sample collected, subsamples ranged from n = 3 to n = 30;
   from these data means and parametric confidence bands were calculated;
   and (2) random subsamples (n = 3 to n = 36) were selected from the total
   Cs-137 reference sample, and each subsample was in turn resampled 1000
   times with replacement to establish a sampling distribution of means.
   Thus, an empirically derived mean and 95\% confidence bands were
   established. Caesium-137 activities determined from each approach were
   input into equations to estimate SRD from two cultivated fields. Results
   indicate that the one-time random sampling approach for subsamples of
   size less than or equal to 12 significantly over-or under-estimated net
   SRD, particularly from the gently sloping agricultural field.
   Computer-intensive resampling produced significantly better estimates of
   net SRD when compared with the random one-sample approach, especially
   when a subsample of size three was used. Landscape stability, based on
   partitioning the agricultural fields into areas exhibiting erosion,
   stability and deposition, was better approximated for both fields by
   applying resampling. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{While there has been increased interest in determining sedimentation
   rates and sources in agricultural and forested catchments in recent
   years, there have been few studies dealing with urbanized catchments. A
   study of sedimentation rates and sources within channel and floodplain
   deposits of a partially urbanized catchment has been undertaken using
   the Cs-137 technique. Results for sedimentation rates showed no
   particular downstream pattern. This may be partially explained by
   underestimation of sedimentation rates at some sites by failure to
   sample the full Cs-137 profile, floodplain erosion and deliberate
   removal of sediment. Evidence of lateral increases in net sedimentation
   rates with distance from the channel may be explained by increased
   floodplain erosion at sites closer to the channel and floodplain
   formation by lateral deposition. Potential sediment sources for the
   catchment were considered to be forest topsoil, subsurface material and
   sediments derived from urban areas, which were found to be predominantly
   subsurface material. Tracing techniques showed an increase in subsurface
   material for downstream sites, confirming expectations that subsurface
   material would increase in the downstream direction in response to the
   direct and indirect effects of urbanization. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Knowledge of seasonal variation in soil structural and related
   properties is important for the determination of critical periods during
   which soil is susceptible to accelerated erosion and other degradative
   processes. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the magnitude of
   seasonal variations in selected soil and deposited sediment properties
   in relation to soil erodibility for a Miamian silt-loam soil (Typic
   Hapludalf) in central Ohio. Erosion plots (USLE-type) were established
   on a 4.5\% slope and maintained under bare, ploughed conditions from
   1988 to 1991. Particle size distribution, bulk density (rho(b)),
   percentage water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon(SOC), and
   total soil nitrogen (TSN) of both soil and sediment samples were
   monitored between Autumn 1989 and Spring 1991. The soil and sediment
   particle size distributions followed no clear seasonal trends. Soil
   rho(b) increased following tillage (1.20 Mg m(-3)) and was highest (1.45
   Mg m(-3)) during the autumn owing to soil slumping and consolidation
   upon drying. Low winter and spring values of rho(b) and \%WSA (20-50\%
   lower than in autumn) were attributed to excessive wetness and
   freeze-thaw effects. Both SOC and soil TSN contents progressively
   declined (from 2.18 to 1.79\% and 1.97 to 1.75 g kg(-1), respectively)
   after ploughing owing to maintenance of plots under bare, fallow
   conditions. Spring highs and autumn lows of sediment SOC (3.12 vs.
   2.44\%) and TSN (2.70 vs. 1.96 g kg(-1)) contents were a result of the
   combined effects of soil microbial activity and rainfall erosivity. Soil
   properties such as bulk density, SOC and WSA, which vary seasonally, can
   potentially serve as predictors of seasonal soil erodibility, which, in
   turn, could improve the predictive capacity of soil erosion prediction
   models. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   in a typical Mediterranean scrubland were measured during the winters of

   increases gradually from 1990 (sixth months after the forest fire) to
   1995 (five and a half years after the forest fire). Overland flow
   decreases from 45\% of rainfall after the forest fire to less than 6\%
   five and a half years later. The reduction in overland flow was greatest
   in the first two years after the fire because of the quick recovery of
   vegetation. The steady-state infiltration capacity increased every year
   after the fire. Runoff and infiltration changes are mainly determined by
   the gradual recovery of vegetation. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Marathwada Agricultural University, Pharbani, has developed about 560
   hectares of Wagarwadi watershed in Pharbani district since 1987.
   Groundwater monitoring on 16 observations wells at weekly intervals
   commenced in January 1992, and rainfall and pan evaporation has been
   measured daily at a hydrometeorological station situated in the nearby
   university campus. Aquifer parameters, namely, transmissivity and
   specific yield, have been estimated by carrying out a pumping test on a
   large diameter well. Groundwater recharge resulting from rainfall has
   been estimated using a water balance model of the soil moisture zone
   considering soil zone thickness and crops grown. The SCS (Soil
   Conservation Service) curve number method was used for surface runoff
   estimation. The groundwater flow model has been constructed using the
   nested squares, finite difference method. Nested square meshes of sizes
   160 m x 160 m and 80 m x 80 m have been used and the steady-state
   condition of aquifer system was simulated in the model assuming the June
   1992 water level configuration under equilibrium conditions. The model
   has been calibrated for transient conditions incorporating additional
   seepage from the water harvesting structures and their contribution to
   the groundwater regime has been assessed. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

   the reference crop, and the evapotranspiration of the latter is
   determined with the simplified equation of Makkink as proposed by De

   of 1985 at the Sinderhoeve (51 degrees 59'N, 5 degrees 45'E) near Renkum

Abstract = {{Water and nutrient fluxes were studied during a 12-month period in an
   alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides) forest, located in a remote site at the
   Cordillera de la Costa (40 degrees 05'S) in southern Chile. Measurements
   of precipitation, throughfall, stemflow, effective precipitation, soil
   infiltration and stream flow were carried out in an experimental, small
   watershed. Simultaneously, monthly water samples were collected to
   determine the concentrations and transport of organic-N, NO3-N, total-P,
   K+, Ca2+, Na+ and Mg2+ in all levels of forest Concentration of
   organic-N, NO3-N, total-P and K+ showed a clear pattern of enrichment in
   the throughfall, stemflow, effective precipitation and soil
   infiltration. For Ca2+ and Mg2+, enrichment was observed in the
   effective precipitation, soil infiltration and stream flow. Annual
   transport of K+, Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ showed that the amounts exported
   from the forest via stream flow (K+ = 0.95, Na+ = 32.44, Ca2+ = 8.76 and
   Mg2+ = 7.16 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) are less than the inputs via precipitation
   (Kf = 6.39, Na+ = 40.99, Ca2+ = 15.13 and Mg2+ = 7.61 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)).
   The amounts of organic-N and NO3-N exported via stream flow (organic-N =
   1.04 and No-3-N = 3.06 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were relatively small; however,
   they represented greater amounts than the inputs via precipitation
   (organic-N = 0.74 and NO3-N = 0.97 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), because of the
   great contribution of this element in the superficial soil horizon,
   where the processes of decomposition of organic material, mineralization
   and immobilization of the nutrients occurs. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

   an important influence on contaminant concentrations, and commonly
   exhibits significant spatial variability in response to the dynamic
   nature of overbank flow and sediment transport. Information on the
   spatial variability of the grain size composition of overbank deposits
   is therefore essential for developing an improved understanding of the
   processes controlling sediment transport on floodplains, and for
   investigating the fate of sediment-associated contaminants. Such
   information is also important for validating existing floodplain
   sedimentation models. This paper reports the results of a study aimed at
   investigating the spatial variability of the grain size composition of
   floodplain sediments at different spatial scales, through analysis of
   surface sediment samples representative of contemporary floodplain
   deposits collected from frequently inundated floodplain sites on five
   British lowland rivers. Significant lateral and downstream variations in
   the grain size composition of the sediment deposits have been identified
   in the study reaches. An attempt has been made to relate the observed
   spatial distribution of the grain size composition of the overbank
   deposits to the local floodplain geometry and topography. The importance
   of the particle size characteristics of the suspended sediment
   transported by the rivers in influencing the spatial variability of the
   grain size composition of the overbank sediments deposited on these
   floodplains is also considered. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrogeochemistry of shallow groundwater has been characterized in
   the Allt a' Mharcaidh catchment in the Scottish Cairngorms in order to:
   (i) assess the spatial and temporal variation in groundwater chemistry;
   (ii) identify the hydrogeochemical processes regulating its evolution;
   and (iii) examine the influence of groundwater on the quality and
   quantity of stream flow. Shallow groundwater in superficial drift
   deposits is circumneutral (pH similar to 7.1) and base cation
   concentrations are enriched compared with precipitation and drainage
   water from overlying podzolic soils. Modelling with NETPATH suggests
   that the dominant geochemical processes that account for this are the
   dissolution of plagioclase, K-feldspar and biotite. Groundwater emerging
   as springs from weathered granite underlying high altitude (> 900 m)
   alpine soils shows similar characteristics, though weathering rates are
   lower, probably as a result of reduced residence times and lower
   temperatures. Chemical hydrograph separation techniques using acid
   neutralizing capacity (ANC) and Si as tracers show that groundwater is
   the dominant source of baseflow in the catchment and also buffers the
   chemistry of stream water at high flows: groundwater may account for as
   much as 50-60\% of annual runoff in the catchment. Climate and land use
   in the Cairngorms are vulnerable to future changes, which may have major
   implications for hydrogeological processes in the area. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{The use of GIS (geographical information systems) in hydrology and water
   management has its roots in ideas about the relationship between
   climate, catchment, channel and society that emerged more than a hundred
   years ago. From these beginnings, hydrological GIS has come to be
   defined primarily by modelling in the science domain and by asset
   (notably infrastructure) management in the water and river management
   domain. In both contexts it can be demonstrated that data quality
   represents the ultimate constraint, but that the quest for higher
   resolution may carry with it some significant problems. These
   constraints are developed through an examination of the potential use of
   high resolution spatial data in flood insurance applications of GIS.
   While the issues raised have clear technical implications, they also
   have important professional and ethical ramifications which are worthy
   of consideration as a backdrop to the current and future status of GIS
   in hydrology and water management. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Methods developed to process raster digital elevation models (DEM)
   automatically in order to delineate and measure the properties of
   drainage networks and drainage basins are being recognized as
   potentially valuable tools for the topographic parameterization of
   hydrological models. All of these methods ultimately rely on some form
   of overland flow simulation to define drainage courses and catchment
   areas and, therefore, have difficulty dealing with closed depressions
   and flat areas on digital land surface models. Some fundamental
   assumptions about the nature of these problem topographic features in
   DEM are implicit in the various techniques developed to deal with them
   in automated drainage analysis. The principal assumptions are: (1) that
   closed depressions and flat areas are spurious features that arise from
   data errors and limitations of DEM resolution; (2) that flow directions
   across flat areas are determined solely by adjacent cells of lower
   elevation; and (3) that closed depressions are caused exclusively by the
   underestimation of DEM elevations. It is argued that while the first of
   these assumptions is reasonable, given the quality of DEMs generally
   available for hydrological analysis, the others are not. Rather it seems
   more likely that depressions are caused by both under- and
   overestimation errors and that flow directions across hat areas are
   determined by the distribution of both higher and lower elevations
   surrounding flat areas. Two new algorithms are introduced that are based
   on more reasonable assumptions about the nature of flat areas and
   depressions, and produce more realistic results in application. These
   algorithms allow breaching of depression outlets and consider the
   distribution of both higher and lower elevations in assigning flow
   directions on flat areas. The results of applying these algorithms to
   some real and hypothetical landscapes are presented. (C) 1998 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Description of the terrain surface through digital elevation models
   (DEMs) strongly depends on data collection methods and DEM data
   structures. For efficiency and availability reasons regular point
   distributions are most common, which yield artefacts such as depressions
   and preferential flow directions. These facts need to be considered when
   natural phenomena are modelled, as is shown for handling depressions and
   for estimation of flow paths and upslope contributing areas. Analysis of
   the main reasons for the occurrence of depressions shows that they
   usually better reflect the terrain than their surroundings. Thus, the
   most common remedial method of raising depressions is rejected.
   Algorithms that `cut' a flow path from the depression through its
   bounding barrier are favoured instead. Several flow routing algorithms
   are evaluated for their behaviour in regular grids. It is shown that the
   multiple flow direction (mfd) algorithm that distributes water from a
   grid cell to the lower of its eight neighbours proportionally to their
   elevation differences (slope) exhibits correct flow directions and the
   best rotation invariance. It is suggested that the estimation of upslope
   contributing areas (TCAs) is undertaken in two steps: first, a high
   quality flow direction data set is derived by a well-behaved mfd
   algorithm or by subgrid modelling of flow paths; secondly, the upslope
   contributing areas are obtained by counting the upslope elements. (C)

Abstract = {{A large-scale distribution function model was used to investigate the
   effect of differing parameter mapping schemes on the quality of
   hydrological predictions.
   Precipitation was mapped over a large forested catchment area (163
   km(2)) using both one-dimensional linear and three-dimensional
   non-linear interpolation schemes. Lumped stream flow predictions were
   found to be particularly sensitive to the different precipitation maps,
   with the three-dimensional map predicting 12\% higher mean annual
   precipitation, resulting in 36\% higher modelled stream flow over a
   three-year period. However, spatial predictions of stream flow appeared
   worse when derived from the three-dimensional map, which is considered
   the better of the two precipitation maps. This implies uncertainty in
   either the model's response to precipitation or the precipitation
   mapping process (the 12\% precipitation difference was strongly
   determined by a single, short term gauge). Leaf area index (LAI) was
   mapped using both remote sensing and species based methods. The two LAI
   maps had similar lumped mean values but exhibited significant spatial
   differences. The resulting lumped predictions of stream flow did not
   vary. This suggests a linear response of water balance to LAI in the
   non-water-limited conditions of the study area, and de-emphasizes the
   importance of quantifying relative spatial variations in LAI.
   Topographic maps were created for a small experimental subcatchment(15
   ha) using both air photographic interpretation and ground survey. The
   two maps differed markedly and lead to significantly different spatial
   predictions of runoff generation, but nearly identical predicted
   hydrographs. Thus, at scales of small basins, accurate topographic
   mapping is suggested to be of little importance in distribution function
   modelling because models are unable to make use of complex spatial data.
   Predictions of water yield can be very sensitive (in the case of
   precipitation) or insensitive (in the case of small-scale topography) to
   changes in spatial parameterization. In either case, increased
   complexity in spatial parameterization does not necessarily result in
   better, or more certain prediction of hydrological response. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Spatially distributed rainfall-runoff models, made feasible by the
   widespread availability of land surface characteristics data (especially
   digital topography), and the evolution of high power desktop
   workstations, are particularly useful for assessment of the hydrological
   effects of land surface change. Three examples are provided of the use
   of the Distributed Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation Model (DHSVM) to assess the
   hydrological effects of logging in the Pacific Northwest. DHSVM provides
   a dynamic representation of the spatial distribution of soil moisture,
   snow cover, evapotranspiration and runoff production, at the scale of
   digital topographic data (typically 30-100 m). Among the hydrological
   concerns that have been raised related to forest harvest in the Pacific
   Northwest are increases in flood peaks owing to enhanced rain-on-snow
   and spring radiation melt response, and the effects of forest roads. The
   first example is for two rain-on-snow floods in the North Fork
   Snoqualmie River during November 1990 and December 1989. Predicted
   maximum vegetation sensitivities (the difference between predicted peaks
   for all mature vegetation compared with all clear-cut) showed a 31\%
   increase in the peak runoff for the 1989 event and a 10\% increase for
   the larger 1990 event. The main reason for the difference in response
   can be traced to less antecedent low elevation snow during the 1990
   event. The second example is spring snowmelt runoff for the Little
   Naches River, Washington, which drains the east slopes of the Washington
   Cascades. Analysis of spring snowmelt peak runoff during May 1993 and
   April 1994 showed that, for current vegetation relative to all mature
   vegetation, increases in peak spring stream flow of only about 3\%
   should have occurred over the entire basin. However, much larger
   increases (up to 30\%) would occur for a maximum possible harvest
   scenario, and in a small headwaters catchment, whose higher elevation
   leads to greater snow coverage (and, hence, sensitivity to vegetation
   change) during the period of maximum runoff. The third example, Hard and
   Ware Creeks, Washington, illustrates the effects of forest roads in two
   heavily logged small catchments on the western slopes of the Cascades.
   Use of DHSVM's road runoff algorithm shows increases in peak runoff for
   the five largest events in 1992 (average observed stream flow of 2.1
   m(3) s(-1)) averaging 17.4\% for Hard Creek and 16.2\% for Ware Creek,
   with a maximum percentage increase (for the largest event, in Hard
   Creek) of 27\%. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The application of geographical information systems (GIS) in modelling
   runoff and erosion in catchments offers considerable potential. Several
   examples illustrate simple GIS techniques to produce erosion hazard
   indices or erosion estimates using USLE-type models. Existing erosion
   models can also be loosely coupled to a GIS, such as the ANSWERS model.
   Furthermore, models can be fully integrated into a GIS by embedded
   coupling, such as the LISEM model. However, GIS raster-based erosion
   models do not necessarily produce better results than much simpler and
   partly lumped erosion models with `representative elements', although
   they reproduce topography in more detail. The reasons for the
   disappointing results of spatial models must be sought in the
   uncertainty involved in estimating and measuring the large number of
   input variables at a catchment scale. There is a need for much simpler
   loosely coupled or embedded GIS erosion models simulating only the
   dominant processes operating in the catchment. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Large landslides can deliver substantial volumes of sediment to river
   channels, with potentially adverse consequences for water quality and
   fish habitat. When planning land use activities, it is important both to
   consider the risks posed by landslides and to account for the effects of
   land use on rates of landslide movement. Of particular interest in the
   Pacific Northwest are the effects of timber harvest in groundwater
   recharge areas of landslides. Because of variability between sites, and
   variability over time in precipitation and other natural environmental
   factors affecting landslide behaviour, empirical data are usually
   insufficient for making such determinations. We describe here the use of
   simple numerical models of site hydrology, groundwater flow and slope
   stability for estimating the effects of timber harvest on the stability
   of the Hazel Landslide in northwestern Washington State. These effects
   are examined relative to those of river bank erosion at the landslide
   toe. The data used are distributed in time and space, as are the model
   results. A geographical information system (GIS) provides an efficient
   framework for data storage, transfer and display. Coupled with
   process-based numerical models, a GIS provides an effective tool for
   site-specific analysis of landslide behaviour. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Landslides mapped in 14 watershed analyses in Oregon and Washington
   provide a regional test of a model for shallow landsliding. A total of
   3224 landslides were mapped in watersheds covering 2993 km(2) and
   underlain by a variety of lithologies, including Tertiary sedimentary
   rocks of the Coast Ranges, volcanic rocks of the Cascade Range and
   Quaternary glacial sediments in the Puget Lowlands. GIS (geographical
   information system) techniques were used to register each mapped
   landslide to critical rainfall values predicted from a theoretical model
   for the topographic control on shallow landsliding using 30 m DEMs
   (digital elevation models). A single set of parameter values appropriate
   for simulating slide hazards after forest clearing was used for all
   watersheds to assess the regional influence of topographic controls on
   shallow landsliding. Model performance varied widely between watersheds,
   with the best performance generally in steep watersheds underlain by
   shallow bedrock and the worst performance in generally low gradient
   watersheds underlain by thick glacial deposits. Landslide frequency
   (slides/km(2)) varied between physiographic provinces but yielded
   consistent patterns of higher slide frequency in areas with lower
   critical rainfall values. Simulations with variable effective cohesion
   predicted that high root strength effectively limits shallow landsliding
   to topographic hollows with deep soils and locations that experience
   excess pore pressures, but that low root strength leads to higher
   probabilities of failure across a greater proportion of the landscape.

Abstract = {{Predictive assessments of non-point source (NPS) pollution can have
   great utility for environmentally focused land use decisions related to
   both the remediation of existing groundwater contamination and the
   regulation of current (and future) agrochemical use. At the regional
   scales associated with NPS agrochemical applications there are
   staggering data management problems in assessing potential groundwater
   vulnerability. Geographical information system (GIS) technology is a
   timely tool that greatly facilitates the organized characterization of
   regional-scale variability. In this paper we review the recently
   reported (Loague et al., 1998a,b) simulations of NPS groundwater
   vulnerability, resulting from historical applications of the
   agrochemical DBCP (1,2-dibromo-3-chloropropane), for east-central Fresno
   County (California). The Fresno case study helps to illustrate the data
   requirements associated with process-based three-dimensional simulations
   of coupled fluid flow and solute transport in the unsaturated/saturated
   subsurface at a regional scale. The strengths and weaknesses of using
   GIS in regional-scale vulnerability assessments, such as the Fresno case
   study, and the critical problem of estimating the uncertainties in these
   assessments (owing to both data and model errors) are discussed. A
   regional GIS-driven integrated assessment approach is proposed, which is
   based upon cost-benefit analysis, and incorporates both physical and
   economic factors that can be used in a regulatory decision process. (C)

Abstract = {{Representative patterns of surface sediment plumes in coastal waters of
   the Santa Barbara Channel are described based on analysis of a
   time-series of remote sensing data (1972-present) for winter conditions.
   The first-order terrestrial influence on the patterns is that the
   largest plumes are generated from the largest watersheds during and
   following significant (> 3 cm precipitation) winter storms. For example,
   coastal sediment plumes generated from the three largest watersheds, the
   Santa Ynez, Ventura and Santa Clara river watersheds, are always the
   largest surface plume features in the winter coastal waters. The largest
   plume observed in the remote sensing data was generated from the
   combined outflow of the Ventura and Santa Clara rivers in February 1983,
   following approximately 25 cm of rain in the previous month, and
   averaged 10 km long and 25 m wide. A second-order effect on the spatial
   patterns of the coastal plumes is the position of watershed outlets with
   respect to coastal geography as shown by a comparison of, (i) the
   watershed morphometry, (ii) the accumulated runoff, (iii) the cell-based
   erosion potential, and (iv) the near-shore bathymetry for two of the
   Northern Channel Islands, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz. In particular,
   Santa Rosa Island is surrounded by shallow coastal waters which may
   experience resuspension of sediment throughout the year. (C) 1998 John

   quite small. This paper illustrates subtle changes in river planform on
   a single meander bend of the lower River Dee, Wales, and the

   excellent framework for integrating historical and contemporary
   information from different sources, and for quantifying possible
   transcription errors so that true environmental associations and
   relatively small changes, in the context of the spatial scales of the
   sources, can be identified with confidence. As a result, functional
   units within the riparian zone of a regulated river can be defined and

Abstract = {{A method that combines calibration and identifiability analysis of a
   dynamic water quality model to evaluate the relative importance of
   various processes affecting the dynamic aspects of water composition is
   illustrated by a study of the response of suspended sediment and
   dissolved nutrients to a flood hydrograph in a rural catchment area in
   the Netherlands. Since the water quality model simulates the observed
   concentrations of suspended sediment and dissolved nutrients reasonably
   well, the most important processes during the observed flood hydrograph
   could be determined. These were erosion, exchange between dissolved
   phase and bed sediments and denitrification. It is concluded that the
   method is very useful for identifying the most significant model
   parameters and processes that are essential for water quality modelling.

Abstract = {{The sediment delivery processes occurring in a small Sicilian basin are
   modelled using the spatially distributed SEDD model recently proposed by
   Ferro and Minacapilli. The model is applied by using soil data
   (grain-size distribution, organic matter content, etc.) of 129 samples
   uniformly distributed over the study area and compiling the available
   information (topographic map, soil data, etc.) into a Geographical
   Information System. Finally, the predictive capability of the
   distributed sediment delivery approach is tested experimentally using
   the caesium-137 measurement technique. The comparison between calculated
   sediment yield and the corresponding measured caesium-137 loss is used
   to validate the SEDD model at the scale of both the single morphological
   unit and the entire basin. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) relationship was generated
   by pooling annual maximum rainfall series from 14 recording rain gauges
   in southern Taiwan. Dimensionless frequency curves, plotted by the
   growth curve method, can be well fitted by regression equations for a
   duration ranging from 10 mins to 24 hours. As the parameters in
   regression equations have a good statistical relationship with average
   annual rainfall, a generalized regional IDF formula was then formulated.
   The formula, based on average annual rainfall as an index, can be easily
   applied to non-recording rain gauges. This paper further applies the
   mean value first-order second moment (MFOSM) method to estimate the
   uncertainty of the proposed regional IDF formula. From a stochastic
   viewpoint, the generalized regional IDF formula can accurately simulate
   the IDF relationship developed using frequency analysis (EV1) at
   individual stations. The method can provide both rainfall intensity and
   variance isohyetal maps for various rainfall durations and return
   periods over the study area. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Evaporation losses from four water catchment areas under different land
   uses and climatic conditions were calculated using formulations
   developed from small plot studies. These formulations, dependent on
   rainfall inputs, potential evaporation and air temperature, were
   extrapolated to the catchment scale using land classifications based on
   analysing remotely sensed imagery. The approach adopted was verified by
   comparing the estimated annual evaporation losses with catchment water
   use, given by the difference between rainfall inputs and stream flow
   outputs, allowing for changes in soil moisture.
   This procedure was repeated using modified values of rainfall, potential
   evaporation and air temperature, as given by a climate change scenario.
   The computed evaporation losses were used in annual water balances to
   calculate stream flow losses under the climate change scenario, it was
   found that, in general, stream flow from areas receiving high rainfall
   would increase as a result of climate change. For low rainfall areas, a
   decrease in stream flow was predicted. The largest actual changes in
   stream flow were predicted to occur during the winter months, although
   the largest percentage changes will occur during the summer months. The
   implications of these changes on potable water supply are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{A deeper knowledge of the hydrological response of semi-arid
   Mediterranean watersheds would be useful in the prediction of runoff
   production for assessing flood risks and planning flood mitigation
   works. This study was conducted to identify the runoff generation
   mechanisms and their controlling factors at the hillslope scale in a
   Mediterranean semi-arid watershed. Four zero-order microcatchments were
   selected to measure rainfall and runoff for a three-year period. Two
   groups of soil were differentiated with respect to the hydrological
   response. The fine textured, poorly permeable soils of low organic
   carbon content had a greater runoff coefficient (9\%) and lower runoff
   threshold (3.6 mm) than more permeable, coarser textured soils of medium
   organic carbon content (<3\%, and 8 mm, respectively). The influence of
   rainfall characteristics on the hydrological response was different.
   Rain intensity was the major rainfall parameter controlling the runoff
   response in the microcatchments on fine textured, low infiltrability
   soils with a poor plant cover, while total rainfall was more closely
   correlated with runoff in coarser textured, highly permeable soils with
   a denser plant cover. It can be concluded that there are two runoff
   generation mechanisms: (i) an infiltration-excess overland flow in the
   more degraded areas with low organic carbon content (<0.5\%) and low
   infiltrability (> 5 mm h(-1)); and (ii) a saturation-excess overland
   flow in the less degraded areas with a high organic carbon content
   (>2\%), high infiltrability (>8 mm h(-1)) and covered by a dense plant
   cover (>50\%). (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Nash model was used for application of the Kalman filter. The state
   vector of the rainfall-runoff system was constituted by the IUH
   (instantaneous unit hydrograph) estimated by the Nash model and the
   runoff estimated by the Nash model using the Kalman filter. The initial
   values of the state vector were assumed as the average of 10\% of the
   IUH peak values and the initial runoff estimated from the average IUH.
   The Nash model using the Kalman filter with a recursive algorithm
   accurately predicted runoff from a basin in Korea. The filter allowed
   the IUH to vary in time, increased the accuracy of the Nash model and
   reduced physical uncertainty of the rainfall-runoff process in the river
   basin. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A simple model describing the transformation of effective rainfall to
   direct runoff through the overland flow mechanism is presented. The
   model is based on the classical representation of a watershed by a
   combination of planes and channels. The dynamics of overland flow in
   each plane is simulated by the non-linear kinematic wave, but the
   outflow from a given plane is concentrated in the middle of the
   corresponding drainage channel. The water routing in the channels is
   carried out by a piece-wise linearized formulation in space of the
   kinematic wave approximation. Using synthetic events on 10 watersheds,
   the model was tested by comparing it with results obtained by applying
   the non-linear kinematic wave to all the elements of the watershed. The
   model was found to be adequate, even in a form that simplifies the
   geometric features of the planes through an averaging procedure based on
   the Horton-Strahler ordering scheme of the watershed. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{The advection-dispersion equation with spatially variable coefficients
   does not have an exact analytical solution and is therefore solved
   numerically. However, solutions obtained with several of the traditional
   finite difference or finite element techniques typically exhibit
   spurious oscillation or numerical dispersion when advection is dominant.
   The mixing cell and semi-analytical solution methods proposed in this
   study avoid such oscillation or numerical dispersion when advection
   dominates. Both the mixing cell and semi-analytical solution methods
   calculate the spatial step size by equating numerical dispersion to
   physical dispersion. Because of the spatial variability of the
   coefficients the spatial step size varies in space. When the time step
   size Delta t --> 0, the mixing cell method reduces to the
   semi-analytical solution method. The results of application to two cases
   show that the mixing cell and semi-analytical solution methods are
   better than a finite difference method used in the study. (C) 1998 John

Title = {{Evaluating the performance of a deterministic daily rainfall-runoff

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The characterization of a stream's low-flow regime is required for
   ecological purposes, water quality studies and various other water
   projects. If observed stream flow records are insufficient, low-flow
   characteristics may need to be estimated from simulated daily stream
   flow time-series. The model employed should conceptualize low-flow
   generation mechanisms and surface-subsurface interactions adequately.
   The ability of the model to simulate low-flow regimes may be assessed by
   means of various low-flow analysis techniques. This paper illustrates
   the approach using the example of the physically based, semi-distributed
   VTI daily rainfall-runoff model. The model has been applied to five
   perennial headwater catchments in South Africa, which are located in
   different parts of the country, represent different physiographical
   environments and are characterized by different baseflow responses. The
   model simulations are evaluated in terms of both conventional
   goodness-of-fit criteria and several low-flow measures such as recession
   characteristics, baseflow volumes, flow duration curves and continuous
   low-flow events below specified threshold discharges. For all the
   catchments considered the model has been found to perform successfully
   in terms of conventional fit statistics and flow duration curves.
   However, its ability to reproduce recession characteristics and
   continuous low-flow spells appears to be less satisfactory. This
   suggests that daily model simulations should be evaluated by low-flow
   criteria, which are frequently ignored in water resource assessment
   practices. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A genetic and evolutionary model is established for saline depressions
   in continental areas. These depressions are located in arid or subarid
   areas, and are developed on low permeability geological mediums (K < 10
   mm/day) with a lack of streams reaching the small lakes. The phenomenon
   of evaporation is fundamental, since it is the basic requirement for the
   presence or absence of a free water surface in the lake, and also for
   depression of the phreatic surface, which causes inflow of groundwater
   towards the lake. With these conditions, the proposed model includes the
   following stages: (i) initiation of the close depression; (ii) deepening
   of the depression; (iii) formation of the lake basin and the end of the
   deepening; and (iv) levelling and lateral extension of the lake basin.
   The combined effects of groundwater flows and aeolian action offer a
   coherent explanation for the origin and evolution both of the closed
   depressions found in the Ebro Valley, and of the salt lakes that
   subsequently form. The processes described form morphologies of oval
   shape with the main axis parallel to the direction of the wind, flat
   floors and evaporitic sedimentation, although they act on geological
   materials with different lithologies. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of micrometeorological variables were made for a complete
   annual cycle using an automatic weather station and two energy
   budget-Bowen ratio systems at a field site adjacent to the Santa Cruz
   River in southern Arizona. These data were used to provide the basis of
   an estimate of the evaporation from a one-mile long losing reach of a
   riparian corridor in this semi-arid environment. A remotely sensed map
   of vegetation cover was used to stratify the corridor into five
   categories of surface cover. The total evaporation was calculated as the
   area-weighted average of the measured evaporation for sampled areas of
   the two most common covers, and appropriate estimates of evaporation for
   the less common covers. Measurements showed a substantial, seasonally
   dependent evaporation from the taller, deep-rooted riparian cover in the
   study reach, while the short, sparse vegetation provided little
   evaporation. In terms of the volume of water evaporated from the study
   reach, the evaporation from irrigated agriculture accounts for almost
   half of the total loss, while the majority of the remaining evaporation
   is from the taller riparian vegetation covers, with about one-quarter of
   the total loss estimated as coming from obligatory phreatophytes,
   primarily cottonwood. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Comparatively little is known about the hydrology of desert flash-floods
   despite the extent of the world's drylands, There is even less known
   about their sedimentary behaviour and particularly about the movement of
   coarse material as bedload. The results of an intense field monitoring
   programme carried out on an ephemeral gravel-bed stream in the northern
   Negev Desert are presented. In this semi-arid setting, flow duration
   analysis indicates that the channel is hydrologically active for 2\% of
   the time, or about seven days per year, and that overbank flow can be
   expected for only 0.03\% of the time - about three hours per year.
   Multipeaked flood hydrographs are the norm, reflecting many factors
   including the arrival of separate slugs of discharge from contributing
   subcatchments, The passage of the initial flood bore is surprisingly
   slow, but the rising limb of the flood hydrograph is rapid with a median
   time of rise of 10 minutes, in keeping with expected flash-hood
   behaviour. Bedload flux is high, averaging 2.67 kg s(-1) m(-1) during
   the period that the channel carries flow. This gives very high bedload
   sediment yield despite the infrequent and short duration of flood flows
   and matches the high yield of suspended sediment. The relationship
   between bedload flux and boundary shear stress is simple, in contrast
   with perennial gravel-bed streams, and the exponent of the log-log
   relationship is 1.52. Of great value is that the behaviour of the Nahal
   Eshtemoa corroborates a pattern established by the authors previously in
   a smaller tributary stream. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Pages = {{559-573}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Starting from a simplified version of the water balance equation, it is
   shown how the levels and outflows from a open lake can be related to the
   magnitude and statistical characteristics of the annual net basin supply
   series, which is defined as the net inflow arising from tributary
   inflows, rainfall on the lake surface and the lake evaporation. Using
   the models, estimates are derived for the response time for several
   large open lakes in Africa and Asia. Also, the observed net basin supply
   series for three major lakes (Victoria, Malawi and Toba) are
   investigated in detail. It is suggested that, on an annual basis, the
   assumption of a random normally distributed series of net basin supply
   can provide a reasonable first guess for the equilibrium response of a
   lake and for the likely range of variation of levels. These estimates
   are likely to be useful in water resources assessments and for
   investigations of the effects of land use and climate change on lake
   levels. The effects of departures from this simplified approach are
   discussed and are illustrated with some practical examples. (C) 1998

   experimental site on the regulated River Blithe, Staffordshire, UK.
   Results from a pilot study are presented for eight days during July,
   September, October and November 1994.
   Total energy gains were dominated by net short-wave radiation (97.60\%)
   with significant contributions from sensible heat exchange and friction
   (1.17 and 1.06\%, respectively) and minor additions from condensation
   and bed conduction (0.16 and 0.01\%, respectively). Net long-wave
   radiation, evaporation, conduction into the river bed, sensible heat
   transfer and the energy advected during evaporation accounted for 53.98,
   23.56, 16.27, 5.25 and 0.94\% of the total heat losses. On average, over
   82\% of the total energy transfers occurred at the air-water interface.
   Approximately 15\% of the total energy exchanges occurred at the channel
   bed, but maximum daily heat exchanges accounted for up to 24\% of the
   daily total energy transfer. The amount of short-wave radiation
   attenuated in the water column, and values measured at the channel bed
   varied considerably from those calculated using a standard coefficient.
   Values of bed conduction varied in response to different vertical
   thermal profiles in the channel bed, reflecting the variable influence
   of sedimentology and groundwater flux. Fluctuations in levels of
   periphyton and macrophyte cover were also shown to have a significant
   effect on energy fluxes at the channel bed. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{In many arid and semi-arid environments of the world, years of extended
   droughts are not uncommon. The occurrence of a drought can be reflected
   by the deficiency of the rainfall or stream flow sequences below the
   long-term mean value, which is generally taken as the truncation level
   for the identification of the droughts. The commonly available
   statistics for the above processes are mean, coefficient of variation
   and the lag-one serial correlation coefficient, and at times some
   indication of the probability distribution function (pdf) of the
   sequences. The important elements of a drought phenomenon are the
   longest duration and the largest severity for a desired return period,
   which form a basis for designing facilities to meet exigencies arising
   as a result of droughts. The sequences of drought variable, such as
   annual rainfall or stream flow, may follow normal, lognormal or gamma
   distributions, and may evolve in a Markovian fashion and are bound to
   influence extremal values of the duration and severity. The effect of
   the aforesaid statistical parameters on the extremal drought durations
   and severity have been analysed in the present paper. A formula in terms
   of the extremal severity and the return period `T' in years has been
   suggested in parallel to the flood frequency formula, commonly cited in
   the hydrological texts. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this study a stochastic approach to calibration of an orographic
   precipitation model (Rhea, 1978) was applied in the Gunnison River Basin
   of south-western Colorado. The stochastic approach to model calibration
   was used to determine: (1) the model parameter uncertainty and
   sensitivity; (2) the grid-cell resolution to run the model (10 or 5 km
   grids); (3) the model grid rotation increment; and (4) the basin
   subdivision by elevation band for parameter definition. Results from the
   stochastic calibration are location and data dependent. Uncertainty,
   sensitivity and range in the final parameter sets were found to vary by
   grid-cell resolution and elevation. Ten km grids were found to be a more
   robust model configuration than 5 km grids. Grid rotation increment,
   tested using only 10 km grids, indicated increments of less than 10
   degrees to be superior. Basin subdivision into two elevation bands was
   found to produce `optimal' results for both 10 and 5 km grids. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{In this paper sediment yield data, measured from 1978 to 1994 in two
   small Calabrian basins (W2 and W3) reafforested with eucalyptus trees
   (Eucalyptus occidentalis Engl.), and the Modified Universal Soil Loss
   Equation (MUSLE) applied in a distributed form are used to evaluate the
   anti-erosive effects of eucalyptus cover. At first step the sediment
   yield measurements observed in W2 basin are used to estimate a single
   cover management factor representative of the eucalyptus coppice and
   equal to the median value (0.164) of the cover management factor values
   calculated for each runoff event. Then, the reliability of the selected
   representative cover management factor is verified on W3 by comparing
   the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the measured sediment
   yield with the CDF of the calculated one. Finally, the temporal analysis
   of the crop and management factor is developed searching, at monthly and
   annual scale, the correlation between crop anti-erosive effectiveness
   and rainfall erosivity index. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Three geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH) models are
   investigated. These GIUHs were derived as a function of watershed
   geomorphological characteristics. The geomorphological input parameters
   of the models were determined for 10 basins in Indiana, USA. The three
   GIUH models were used to simulate 187 observed runoff hydrographs of
   these basins. The non-measurable velocity parameters of the GIUH models
   were optimized and the relationships between them were investigated. The
   results of the investigation show that the velocity parameters of the
   three models are correlated. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion and runoff rates are assumed to be highly dependent on
   slope position. However, little knowledge exists about the
   hydrogeomorphological processes at the pedon scale that support this
   idea. In order to assess the hydrological and erosional behaviour of
   soils at different slope positions, simulated rainfall experiments (55
   mm was applied during one hour) were carried out on a south-facing slope
   with underlying limestone in south-east Spain.
   In the mean terms, the erosion rates (9 g m2 hr(-1)) and the runoff
   coefficients (12\%) were very low at the scale of measurement (0.25
   m(2)). The slope position does not affect erosion rates when the
   measurements are carried out under extreme dry conditions during summer.
   The low runoff rates found in summer under thunderstorms of high
   intensity (5 year return period) and the runon into surfaces with higher
   infiltration rates resulted in no detectable direct surface runoff
   (Hortonian) at the slope scale. This implies that erosion as a
   consequence of surface overland flow will only take place during events
   of high magnitude (55 mm hr(-1)) and low frequency (>5 years).
   Vegetation is the most important factor determining the soil erosion and
   runoff rates within the slope. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we try to calculate precipitation in Miyake Island,
   Japan. In order to know the temporal and spatial variations of
   precipitation, we have set 15 rain gauges randomly in the island to
   collect the monthly precipitation data since June 1994. It is found that
   the precipitation is very different from point to point. First, we used
   statistical methods to get the correlations between the monthly
   precipitation at our survey points and that at the weather station.
   Next, regression analyses were used to establish formulae to calculate
   precipitation as a function of altitude, aspect of the geomorphological
   surface and wind direction. Based on these results, distributions of
   monthly and yearly precipitation and delta(18)O over the island were
   assessed. The results show that landscape patterns strongly influence
   precipitation distribution over the island, with the highest
   precipitation being found on the windward side, about 400-600 m above
   sea level. Even at places at the same altitude, the precipitation was
   different because of the aspect of the landscape. At the same time,
   altitude effects for delta(18)O on both the windward and leeward sides
   were -0.10 parts per thousand/100 m and -0.15 parts per thousand/100 m,
   respectively. Comparing with the distribution of precipitation
   distribution, it was also found that delta(18)O for the windward and
   leeward sides was different from that for precipitation, which means
   that both topographical effects must be considered separately. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Litterfall was measured in a dry schlerophyll eucalypt forest and a
   nearby Pinus radiata plantation of similar tree density and basal area
   near Canberra in south-eastern Australia. Total annual litterfall for
   the eucalypts was 329 g m(-2), compared with 180 g m(-2) for the pines,
   with the bark component being 52 g m(-2) for eucalypts and zero for
   pines. Barkfall did not occur for the eucalypts during the drought of
   1982-1983 but complete bark shedding occurred during the subsequent very
   wet year when barkfall was 177 g m(-2) for Eucalyptus rossii and 146 g
   m(-2) for Eucalyptus mannifera (9.3 and 7.6 g m(-2) of basal area,
   respectively). Barkfall of E. rossii responded to rainfall in the period
   autumn to early summer, whereas E. mannifera responded to summer
   rainfall.
   In the eucalypt forest floor-litter was stratified into a surface layer
   where the components were substantially intact, and a cohesive layer
   where the components were fragmented and bound together by fungal
   hyphae. The amount and residence times of loose and cohesive
   floor-litter were 1056 g m(-2) and 3.2 years, respectively, for the
   loose litter layer; and 1164 g m(-2) and 3.5 years for the cohesive
   layer. The litter biomass represented 17\% of the estimated total
   above-ground biomass of 127 tonnes ha(-1). A previous study showed roots
   to be 25\% of total biomass, suggesting a total biomass of 167 tonnes

Abstract = {{This paper concerns recycling of the major nutrients (N, P, Ca, Mg, Na
   and K) by litterfall, throughfall and stemflow in a dry sclerophyll
   eucalypt forest and a nearby Pinus radiata plantation of similar tree
   density and basal area. With the exception of Mg, the concentration of
   these nutrients in eucalypt leaf-fall were substantially higher than in
   pine needlefall. The eucalypt nutrient input was greater owing to larger
   mass of litterfall, as well as higher concentrations. There were inverse
   relationships between N and P concentrations and amount of leaf-fall for
   the eucalypts and needlefall for the pines. Mg was positively correlated
   with eucalypt leaf-fall. For the other components and elements the
   relationships were random.
   The proportion of particular nutrients recycled by litterfall, and
   throughfall and stemflow, varied for both forests. For Ca, only 6 and
   12\%, for eucalypts and pines respectively, was recycled by throughfall
   and stemflow, compared with 52 and 68\% of potassium. The amount of
   nitrogen recycled differed between the forests, in a way that was
   consistent with the eucalypts being native to a nitrogen-poor
   environment. Amounts of floor-litter collected in the eucalypt forest
   from two fairly distinct layers, the loose and cohesive litter, were
   similar. The concentrations of Mg and Na were similar in both layers,
   but the other elements varied substantially. The N concentration of the
   cohesive litter was more than double that of the loose layer, whereas
   its P concentration was only 10\% of the loose layer value,
   Selected chemical analyses on the total tree biomass of the eucalypt
   forest showed that the concentration of elements increased in the order;
   wood, twigs, fine twigs and leaf, and from large diameter wood to fine
   twigs. However, the concentration in fine twig and leaf components
   varied between the elements. For Ca, P and K, the fine twig values were
   greater than the leaf values, but the reverse applied to the other
   elements. The concentrations of almost all elements in all components
   were substantially higher in Eucalyptus mannifera than in E. rossii, E.
   macrorhyncha and E. melliodora. The nutrient content of the floor-litter
   was compared with the twig, fine twig and leaf components of the live
   biomass, i.e. the components most likely to become readily decomposable
   floor-litter. For all elements except N, the amount in floor-litter was
   similar to the amount in the biomass components. This was because the
   concentration of N in the floor-litter was much greater than in these
   components of the biomass. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Mathematical models are being used to develop a decision support system
   for integrated management of the Ythan catchment in NE Scotland. One
   component of this has involved the development of a distributed
   catchment-scale hydrological model. The model is based on subsurface
   flow routing and calculates the contribution to stream flow from each 50
   m x 50 m cell in the 548 km(2) catchment. It uses two topographic
   parameters, slope and distance to stream following the main line of how,
   and five physical parameters. The topographic analysis and distributed
   flow accumulation are performed by linking the single cell model with a
   geographic information system. Preliminary results from a three-year
   simulation of daily flows indicate that the model successfully predicts
   the main characteristics of the catchment flow. (C) 1998 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics of soil water tension in a

Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1998}},

Abstract = {{In ecosystem research great effort is made in measuring soil water
   tension, because this is a critical calibration variable for modelling
   soil water fluxes. In this paper the spatial heterogeneity and temporal
   dynamics of soil tensions and their consequences for the determination
   of water fluxes are investigated. Studies were carried out at a Norway
   spruce stand in the Fichtelgebirge (NE Bavaria). Standard tensiometers
   were installed at three soil depths (20 each) on the whole experimental
   plot, as well as 45 microtensiometers as a dense grid in a small soil
   pit. Microtensiometry at the centimetre scale showed that, depending on
   rain intensity and initial soil water tension, even a soil without
   discernible macrostructure may show preferential water infiltration. At
   the stand scale the variability of soil hydraulic properties and tree
   root distribution causes substantial heterogeneity of soil water
   tension, as observed by standard tensiometers. A functional relationship
   between increasing spatial heterogeneity of tensiometer readings and
   increasing soil water tension was found, which was particularly
   pronounced after longer dry periods. Also at low soil water tension,
   where spatial heterogeneity was low, the calculation of water fluxes
   from tensiometer values was critical, owing to the fact that small
   differences in measuring soil water tension resulted in big differences
   in calculated water fluxes. At high soil water tension in summer the
   spatial heterogeneity of tensiometer readings was extremely high. At our
   experimental site, since 30\% of the total rain in summer falls in
   events having a precipitation rate greater than 5 mm h(-1), preferential
   water and solute flow was an important phenomenon. We conclude that the
   validation of calculated water fluxes using measured soil water tension
   at the stand scale is not an appropriate tool, because of measurement
   difficulties, considerable spatial heterogeneity, especially in dry
   periods, and the great variability of soil hydraulic properties. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper consists of two parts. In the first part, the significance of
   five major factors, including solar radiation, vapour pressure deficit,
   relative humidity, wind speed and air temperature, that control
   evaporation were evaluated comparatively at different time-scales using
   the data from Changines station in Switzerland. The comparative
   evaluation was made at hourly, daily, 10-day and monthly time-scales. It
   was found that the role of controlling variables in evaporation varied
   with the time-scale. The vapour pressure deficit was best correlated
   with pan evaporation at all time-scales, while the wind speed was least
   correlated with pan evaporation, especially when the time period was
   longer than a day. In the second part, four equations for calculating
   evaporation, including temperature-based methods, humidity-based
   methods, mass transfer methods and radiation-based methods, were
   compared with pan evaporation. Of these four equations, the Penman
   equation, representing the mass transfer method, resulted in monthly
   evaporation values that agreed most closely with pan evaporation values.
   The Romanenko equation, representing the humidity method, also compared
   reasonably well with pan evaporation. The Turc equation, representing
   the radiation method, and the Thornthwaite equation, representing the
   temperature method, were found to underestimate evaporation
   significantly, especially for cold months. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Recent decades have seen rapid intensification of cattle production in
   semi-arid savannah ecosystems, increasingly on formalized ranch blocks.
   As a result, vegetation community changes have occurred, notably bush
   encroachment (increased bush dominance) in intensively grazed areas. The
   exact causes of this vegetation change remain widely debated. Previous
   studies have suggested: (i) increased leaching of water and nutrients
   into the subsoil in intensively grazed areas provides deeper rooting
   bush species with a competitive advantage for soil water and nutrients,
   and (ii) nutrient leaching may be exacerbated by nutrient inputs from
   cattle dung and urine. Our research in the Eastern Kalahari showed that
   in infertile sandy soils both the magnitude of soil water and
   concentration of soil nutrients leached into the subsoil is largely
   unaffected by the ecological and biochemical effects of increased cattle
   use. We found that despite the high soil hydraulic conductivity (> 12 cm
   h(-1)), relatively high subsoil moisture contents and the restriction of
   water movement to matrix flow pathways prevent leaching losses beyond
   the rooting zone of savannah grass species. No significant differences
   in patterns of soil water redistribution were noted between bush
   dominant and grass dominant sites. We also found that the low nutrient
   status of Kalahari soils and leachate movement as matrix flow combine to
   allow nutrient adsorption on to soil particles. Nutrient adsorption
   ensures that nitrogen and phosphorus cycling remains topsoil dominated
   even following the removal of vegetation and direct nutrient inputs in
   cattle dung and urine, This conclusion refutes environmental change
   models that portray increases in the leaching of soil water and
   available nitrogen as a major factor causing bush encroachment. This
   provides a possible explanation for the now widely cited, but hitherto
   unexplained, resilience of dryland soils. We suggest that infertile
   sandy soils appear resilient to changes in soil water distribution and
   nutrient availability caused by increased cattle use. Hence, soil
   characteristics contribute to the resilience to permanent ecological
   change that is increasingly recognized as an attribute of semi-arid
   rangelands. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Statistical data over the past 30 years show that the cumulative sum of
   losses caused by floods S(t) has been increasing with time approximately
   as t(1.3), i.e. faster than the linear growth expected for a stationary
   process. (Losses are evaluated by the number of homeless caused by
   floods, since these data are the most systematically reported.) At the
   same time, the factors determining flood losses (the rate of floods and
   single loss distribution) appear to be stationary over the period of
   observation. An explanation of this paradox is suggested based on a
   heavy-tail distribution function of losses, i.e. a distribution function
   with infinite expectation value. The proposed stochastic model predicts
   a faster than linear growth of the cumulative losses until some limiting
   time, which corresponds to the recurrence period of the maximal possible
   single loss. Similar pseudo-non-stationary effects can be observed for
   other types of catastrophes and hydrological characteristics with
   heavy-tail distributions. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   its efficiency through the results obtained from the data observed for
   three species of semi-arid Mediterranean shrub: Juniperus oxycedrus,

Abstract = {{A stream tube integration method is introduced to solve transient
   subsurface fluid flow problems. The method combines a geometry-embedded
   form of Darcy's Law and the notion of location of average. Two types of
   problems, transient radial flow to a well of finite radius in an areally
   infinite aquifer and in a double porosity system, are solved by the
   stream tube integration method and the integral finite difference
   method. Results of the solutions show that the stream tube integration
   method, with fixed coarse mesh, are more accurate and better behaved
   than the integral finite difference method, with fine mesh. The fixed
   mesh stream tube integration method is readily extended to the moving
   mesh method. With much coarse mesh, the moving mesh technique can obtain
   the same accurate results as the fixed mesh stream tube integration
   method. It is suggested that the stream tube integration method is a
   viable way to state, solve, interpret and verify numerical solutions.
   The method provides efficient computation and improved accuracy for
   analysing subsurface fluid flow. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines characteristics of meteorological and runoff
   time-series collected from the Broggerbreen glacier basin, Svalbard,
   during 1991 and 1992. Proglacial discharge and electrical conductivity
   were monitored at two gauging stations: one immediately downstream of
   the terminus of Austre Broggerbreen and another c. 2.5 km downstream, in
   order to assess the contribution of the intervening proglacial sandur.
   Meteorological time-series (incident radiation, wind speed and
   direction, air temperature and precipitation) were monitored on the
   proglacial sandur. Changes in wind direction, incident radiation receipt
   and air temperature were used as a basis for separating the time-series
   into different periods. These periods allowed the relative significance
   of advective and incident (short-wave) radiative forcing of air
   temperatures to be determined at diurnal and synoptic time-scales. The
   analysis shows that incident radiation dominated over advection in the
   forcing of diurnal variations in air temperature during all the periods.
   At the synoptic scale, both processes were periodically dominant in
   forcing air temperature variability. An examination of synoptic charts
   supports the use of ground level measurements to describe the effect of
   energy advection upon the synoptic air temperature variability and
   indicates the role of large-scale circulation patterns in the delivery
   of energy for ablation under different conditions. Interrelationships
   between the hydrological and meteorological time-series are then used to
   characterize the response of the glacierized part of the catchment to
   meteorological forcing throughout the two ablation seasons. The analyses
   show that the recession of the snowpack across the proglacial and
   glacial portions of the basin has an important effect on the catchment
   contributing area contributing to runoff and the lag between energy
   inputs and meltwater discharge outputs. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development and testing of a distributed,
   physically based model of glacier hydrology. The model is used to
   investigate the behaviour of the hydrological system of Haut Glacier
   d'Arolla, Valais, Switzerland. The model has an hourly time-step and
   three main components: a surface energy balance submodel, a surface flow
   routing submodel and a subglacial hydrology submodel. The energy balance
   submodel is used to calculate meltwater production over the entire
   glacier surface. The surface routing submodel routes meltwater over the
   glacier surface from where it is produced to where it either enters the
   subglacial hydrological system via moulins or runs off the glacier
   surface. The subglacial hydrology submodel calculates water flow in a
   network of conduits, which can evolve over the course of a melt season
   simulation in response to changing meltwater inputs. The main model
   inputs are a digital elevation model of the glacier surface and its
   surrounding topography, start-of-season snow depth distribution data and
   meteorological data. Model performance is evaluated by comparing
   predictions with field measurements of proglacial stream discharge,
   subglacial water pressure (measured in a borehole drilled to the glacier
   bed) and water velocities inferred from dye tracer tests. The model
   performs best in comparison with the measured proglacial stream
   discharges, but some of the substantial features of the other two
   records are also reproduced. In particular, the model results show the
   high amplitude water pressure cycles observed in the borehole in the
   mid-melt season and the complex velocity/discharge hysteresis cycles
   observed in dye tracer tests. The results show that to model outflow
   hydrographs from glacierized catchments effectively, it is necessary to
   simulate spatial and temporal variations in surface melt rates, the
   delaying effect of the surface snowpack and the configuration of the
   subglacial drainage system itself. The model's ability to predict
   detailed spatial and temporal patterns of subglacial water pressures and
   velocities should make it a valuable tool for aiding the understanding
   of glacier dynamics and hydrochemistry. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The in situ or effective particle size distribution of fluvial suspended
   sediment may differ considerably from that of the chemically dispersed
   mineral fraction owing to flocculation. Obtaining a meaningful measure
   of the effective particle size distribution ideally requires that
   measurements should be made in situ. A rigorous assessment of the
   associated degree of flocculation also requires that the same
   measurement technique is used subsequently to establish the absolute
   particle size composition of the suspended sediment by analysis of the
   chemically dispersed mineral fraction. While few in situ measurement
   devices currently exist, a Par-Tee 200 laser back-scatter probe has
   previously been shown to be capable of making both in situ and
   laboratory particle size measurements of fluvial sediment. The accuracy
   and precision of this device is assessed in this paper. While able to
   distinguish relative size differences with a high degree of precision,
   the Par-Tee 200 performed poorly in terms of accuracy when compared with
   measurements made using a laser diffraction device. A calibration
   algorithm has been devised for the Par-Tec 200 size data, using standard
   sediment samples sized by means of a laser diffraction device as the
   reference. Application of the calibration to Par-Tee 200 measurements of
   heterogeneous sediment samples significantly improved the
   representativeness of the particle size distribution, both in terms of
   overall form, and the median particle size. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{An exploration of the wavelet transform as applied to daily river
   discharge records demonstrates its strong potential for quantifying
   stream flow variability. Both periodic and non-periodic features are
   detected equally, and their locations in time preserved. Wavelet
   scalograms often reveal structures that are obscure in raw discharge
   data. Integration of transform magnitude vectors over time yields
   wavelet spectra that reflect the characteristic time-scales of a river's
   flow, which in turn are controlled by the hydroclimatic regime. For
   example, snowmelt rivers in Colorado possess maximum wavelet spectral
   energy at time-scales on the order of 4 months owing to sustained high
   summer flows; Hawaiian streams display high energies at time-scales of a
   few days, reflecting the domination of brief rainstorm events. Wavelet
   spectral analyses of daily discharge records for 91 rivers in the US and
   on tropical islands indicate that this is a simple and robust way to
   characterize stream flow variability. Wavelet spectral shape is
   controlled by the distribution of event time-scales, which in turn
   reflects the timing, variability and often the mechanism of water
   delivery to the river. Five hydroclimatic regions, listed here in order
   of decreasing seasonality and increasing pulsatory nature, are described
   from the wavelet spectral analysis: (a) western snowmelt, (b)
   north-eastern snowmelt, (c) mid-central humid, (d) southwestern arid and
   (e) `rainstorm island'. Spectral shape is qualitatively diagnostic for
   three of these regions. While more work is needed to establish the use
   of wavelets for hydrograph analysis, our results suggest that river
   flows may be effectively classified into distinct hydroclimatic
   categories using this approach. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Wildfires raise concerns over the risk of accelerated erosion as a
   result of increased overland flow and decreased protection of the soil
   by litter and ground vegetation cover. We investigated these issues
   following the 1994 fires that burnt large areas of native Eucalyptus
   forest surrounding Sydney, Australia. A review of previous studies
   identifies the fire and rainfall conditions that are likely to lead to
   increased runoff and accelerated erosion. We then compare runoff and
   erosion between burnt and unburnt sites for 10 months after the 1994
   fires.
   At the scale of hillslope plots, the 1994 fire increased runoff by
   enhancing soil hydrophobicity, and greatly increased sediment transport,
   mainly through the reduced ground cover, which lowered substantially the
   threshold for initial sediment movement. However, both runoff and
   sediment transport were very localized, resulting in little runoff or
   sediment yield after the fire at the hillslope catchment scale. We
   identify that after moderately intense fires, rainfall events of greater
   than one year recurrence interval are required to generate substantial
   runoff and sediment yield. Such events did not occur during the
   monitoring period. Past work shows that mild burns have little effect on
   erosion, and it is only after the most extreme fires that erosion is
   produced from small, frequent storms. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{As interest shifts to the development of models for predicting runoff
   quality, identification of the source areas for runoff becomes
   increasingly important. Active microwave remote sensing has a unique
   potential for surveying source areas at the catchment scale.
   Thresholding of the back-scattering coefficient was initially proposed
   but proved unsatisfactory when applied to the ERS-1 SAR multitemporal
   images acquired during winter 1992 over the Coet-Dan catchment,
   concomitantly with ground observations. Difference images may, instead,
   allow the wettest part of the catchment to be identified provided that
   the two images encompass a marked hydrological event. A saturation plot
   could not however be obtained for each date; the use of a pair of images
   may be further limited by the residual speckle (although carefully
   filtered using the multitemporal information) and a slight inaccuracy in
   the SAR image calibration. It is therefore argued that considering the
   whole temporal back-scatter profile would be, at present, a safer
   approach to the remote sensing of saturated areas. The back-scatter
   temporal standard deviation appears, in this light, as a possible good
   indicator of the local saturation likelihood during the period of study:
   it is based on the fact that saturation develops on parts of the
   catchment that are wetter than the others through lateral recharge.
   possible applications within the TOPMODEL framework are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) export from the Foron River watershed was intensively
   monitored. Water was analysed for total P, soluble total P, soluble
   orthophosphate and suspended solids. Watershed soils and river sediments
   were sampled and the size fraction <0.2 mm analysed for total P, water
   extractable P, bioavailable P, 1 minute exchangeable P and P fixation
   capacity. Interstitial waters were analysed for soluble total P.
   Four hydrological conditions recurred, two during low river hows and two
   during increased flow. The first occurs in dry weather with a constant
   or decreasing flow over at least seven days and when there is no surface
   runoff.,Exported phosphorus, predominately soluble and bioavailable, is
   from point sources. Phosphorus inputs exceed P export so P accumulates
   in the river. The second condition occurs when a small storm flow
   increases the average seven-day flow to exceed the preceding weekly
   average. Phosphorus export exceeds P inputs and originates from urban
   runoff, point sources and release of P stored in the river. Exported P
   is largely particulate but highly bioavailable. The third condition is
   when substantial runoff follows at least a seven-day period of constant
   or decreasing flow. Phosphorus export is from diffuse urban runoff. All
   the P stored is exported. Exported P is highly bioavailable. High
   concentrations and fluxes of P export are often seen. The fourth
   condition happens when the soils are wet and increased flow is from both
   urban and agricultural runoff. Phosphorus export from diffuse
   agricultural runoff predominates and is largely not bioavailable.
   Phosphorus concentrations are low but export fluxes are high when flows
   are high. These hydrological conditions, when integrated with concepts
   of mass balance define a phosphorus export typology comprising four
   regimes. These regimes explain total phosphorus (TP) storage, transport
   and export patterns, changes in P speciation and allow identification of
   probable sources of TP in the :Foron river watershed. (C) 1998 John

Abstract = {{The RUNOFF block of EPA's storm water management model (SWMM) was used
   to simulate the quantity and quality of urban storm water runoff from
   four relatively small sites (i.e. 5.97-23.50 ha) in South Florida, each
   with a specific predominant land use (i.e. low density residential, high
   density residential, highway and commercial). The objectives of the
   study were to test the applicability of this model in small subtropical
   urban catchments and provide modellers with a way to select appropriate
   input parameters to be used in planning studies. A total of 58 storm
   events, measured by the US Geological Survey (USGS), provided
   hyetographs, hydrographs and pollutant loadings for biological oxygen
   demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), total Kjeldahl nitrogen
   (TKN) and lead (Pb), and were used for calibration of the model. Several
   other catchment characteristics, also measured or estimated by USGS,
   were used in model input preparation. Application of the model was done
   using the Green-Ampt equation for infiltration loss computation, a
   pollutant accumulation equation using a power build-up equation
   dependent on the number of dry days, and a power wash-off equation
   dependent on the predicted runoff rate. Calibrated quantity input
   parameters are presented and compared with suggested values in the
   literature. The impervious depression storage was generally found to be
   the most sensitive calibration parameter, followed by the Manning's
   roughness coefficients of conduit and overland flow, the Green-Ampt
   infiltration parameters and, finally, the pervious depression storage,
   Calibrated quality input parameters are presented in the form of
   regression equations, as a function of rainfall depth and the number of
   antecedent dry days, A total of 16 independent rainfall events were used
   for verification of the model, which showed a good comparison with
   observed data for both hydrographs and pollutant loadings. Average model
   predictions for the four constituent concentrations from the
   verification runs also showed good agreement with NURP published values
   in Florida and US sites. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{A uniform versus an aggregated water balance of a semi-arid watershed}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{331-342}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Hydrologists have long struggled with the problem of how to account for
   the effects of spatial variability in precipitation, vegetation and
   soils. This problem is particularly acute in snow-fed, semi-arid
   watersheds, which typically have considerable variability in snow
   distribution and vegetation communities on scales much smaller than that
   addressed by most hydrological modelling. In this study, two approaches
   were used to compute a water balance using two years of data collected
   at the Upper Sheep Creek Watershed, a 26-ha semi-arid mountainous
   sub-basin within the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in south-west
   Idaho, USA. The first water balance approach (uniform approach) assumed
   that the entire watershed was homogeneous; the second approach computed
   a partial water balance for each of three landscape units and then
   computed an aggregated water balance for the watershed. Runoff and
   change in groundwater storage were not distinguishable between landscape
   units; thus, the only difference between the two approaches was in the
   estimation of the two major components, precipitation and
   evapotranspiration (ET). Precipitation, which occurs predominantly as
   snow, was measured within each landscape unit directly and adjusted for
   drifting. ET was estimated using the simultaneous heat and water model
   (SHAW) and validated with measurements from Bowen ratio instruments.
   Precipitation input for the two years was approximately 480 and 700 mm,
   respectively; ET was approximately 450 and 410 mm, respectively. The
   water balance for the aggregated approach had a discrepancy of -17 and
   55 mm, respectively for the two years, while the uniform approach was
   within 42 and 86 mm, respectively. (Negative values indicate more
   estimated outflow than inflow.) The differences in precipitation
   estimates for the two approaches were greatest for the second year owing
   to more variability across the watershed, which the uniform approach did
   not adequately address. The largest difference between the aggregated
   and uniform approach for both years was the estimated ET. This was
   attributed to the inability of the uniform approach to associate areas
   of the watershed having more vegetation and leaf area with areas having
   soil water available for transpiration. Differences in ET estimates for
   the two approaches were least during the second year when water was less
   limiting and potential ET was less. This suggests that ET can be
   aggregated more easily when water is not limiting using the average leaf
   area index independently of the spatial variability in leaf area. (C)

Abstract = {{In this preliminary study the partitioning of rain-water into various
   components of the hydrological cycle in three high-altitude forests of
   contrasting tree physiognomies (namely, Aesculus indica, Quercus
   semecarpifolia and Abies pindrow) were studied in the Nandadevi
   Biosphere Reserve, Central Himalaya, India. The results are compared
   with the hydrological characteristics of low-altitude forests of this
   region. The study has indicated a significant role of tree physiognomy
   with regard to rainfall partitioning into the various components of the
   hydrological cycle. It is suggested that A. pindrow (an evergreen tree)
   should be considered superior to A. indica (a deciduous tree) with
   regard to soil and water conservation in this region. This work is of
   relevance to land management programmes pertaining to afforestation,
   logging and regeneration. (C) 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effect of urbanization on runoff from the
   On-Cheon Stream watershed in Pusan, Korea. This watershed has been
   experiencing considerable urbanization since the 1960s. There are two
   gauging stations in the watershed. For one of the stations there are
   recent flow data and for the other flow data were observed in the past.
   A linear reservoir model was chosen and runoff was analysed for several
   flood events. The linear reservoir model has been found to generate
   flood hydrographs accurately for both gauging stations, and its
   applicability to the study area has also been established. Using two
   methods of computing effective rainfall or rainfall excess (phi-index
   and constant percentage met:hod), the results of runoff analyses were
   investigated. The phi-index method yielded better results than the
   constant percentage method. A comparison of hydrographs observed in the
   past with the simulation results at the Ie-Sup bridge site revealed that
   the peak discharge increased and the mean lag time of the study area
   decreased owing to urbanization over the past two decades. It is also
   possible to evaluate the effect of urbanization quantitatively. (C) 1998

Title = {{A high magnitude storm and flood in a hyperarid catchment, Nahal Zin,
   Negev Desert, Israel}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1998}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In October 1991 a high magnitude rainstorm flood, estimated return
   period 40 years, occurred in Nahal Zin, a 1400 km(2) catchment in the
   hyperarid Negev Desert. The meso-scale structure of the storm was a
   curved squall line that developed from a thunderstorm in accordance with
   the topography of the catchment divide, by which it was strongly
   affected. Tropical moisture reached the area via the subtropical jet
   stream, in conjunction with a lower level northward intrusion of the Red
   Sea trough (RST-N) into the Mediterranean Sea. Rainfall, as measured at
   the few and sparse gauging stations, was much too small to account for
   the resulting large flood. Peak flow and other hydraulic characteristics
   of the flood were indirectly reconstructed. The techniques of
   palaeoflood hydrology used were based on sedimentological evidence of
   fine-grained flood sediments deposited in back-flooded tributaries, as
   well as on other stage indicators. The HEC-2 procedure was employed to
   deter mine water surface profiles.
   The spatial and temporal characteristics of the event were studied
   through a combination of rainstorm analysis, remote sensing,
   hydrological and sedimentological data; they jointly explain the
   magnitude and timing of tributary contributions producing the integrated
   flood in the main channel. The flood as reconstructed reveals a
   three-peak hydrograph: two peaks were generated by the same storm but
   had different floodwave arrival times in the main channel; the third
   resulted from a local rainstorm which occurred on the following day and
   covered only one tributary.
   The curved structure of the storm and its dynamics in relation to
   catchment orientation resulted in storm movement in tandem with the
   floodwave. The synchronous contribution from all main tributaries
   preserved evidence of the floodwave both in stage and volume by
   replacing the transmission losses in the sections with thick alluvium.
   Other high magnitude floods on record for the large Negev Desert
   catchments are caused by a cold upper air incursion associated with the
   RST-N. Most of them occur in the autumn and are caused by storms with
   high-intensity rainfall. This is in stark contrast with the flooding
   behaviour of the semi-arid zone further north, which is linked primarily
   to the core of the Mediterranean winter. The complexities involved in
   the generation of a large desert flood, as revealed by this study,
   illustrate the fallacy of applying routine hydrological modelling to
   such events, and underline the need to study the processes involved in
   adequate detail. (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{An on-board technique was developed that combined discharge-weighted
   pumping to a high-speed continuous-flow centrifuge for isolation of the

   changed the particle sizes during isolation, samples of particles in
   suspension were collected at various steps in the isolation process to
   evaluate changes in particle size. Particle sizes were determined using
   laser light-scattering photon correlation spectroscopy and indicated no
   change in size during the colloid isolation process. Mississippi River
   colloid particle sizes from twelve sites from Minneapolis to below New
   Orleans were compared with sizes from four tributaries and three

Abstract = {{Catchment storage capacity is an important factor in the determination
   of catchment sensitivity to climate variability. Quantification of
   catchment sensitivity is in turn important in the regional assessment of
   the effects of possible climate change. In the present paper, an
   empirical regional model is proposed that quantifies catchment
   sensitivity as the ratio of present maximum reservoir storage to
   catchment storage capacity. Catchment storage capacity is defined
   theoretically using readily available catchment variables. Present
   maximum reservoir storage in a catchment, as determined from recession
   analysis, is expressed as a fraction of catchment storage capacity; the
   fraction defines catchment sensitivity and depends on storage capacity
   and annual net precipitation. Average annual conditions for present
   maximum reservoir storage and average annual net precipitation are used
   to test the developed model. Although the study used data from only 15
   catchments in the Upper Loire region in France, the model proved
   statistically valid. Storage capacity calculated with the model compares
   favourably with the baseflow index and a storage index defined in
   previous research. Values of storage capacity are probable with respect
   to reported water resources in the area. With the model catchment
   sensitivity can easily be assessed. Flood or drought prone catchments
   can be identified as well as a catchment's sensitivity to a
   catchment-type transition (baseflow versus direct flow dominated
   catchments). (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A hydrological investigation was conducted in a small headwater peatland
   located in the Experimental Lakes Area, north-western Ontario, Canada,
   to determine the subsurface and surface flow paths within the peatland,

   and storm flow conditions. Distinct zones of groundwater recharge and
   discharge were observed within the peatland. These zones are similar to
   those found in much larger flow systems even though the peatland was
   only influenced by local groundwater flow. Groundwater emerging in seeps
   and flowing beneath the peatland sustained the surface wetness of the
   peatland and maintained a constant baseflow. The response of the
   peatland stream to summer rain events was controlled by peatland water
   table position when the basin was dry and antecedent moisture storage on
   the uplands when the basin was wet. The magnitude and timing of peak
   runoff during wet conditions were controlled by the degree of
   hydrological connectivity between the surrounding upland terrain and the

Abstract = {{There are still relatively few hydrochemical studies of glacial runoff
   and meltwater routing from the high latitudes, where non-temperate
   glacier ice is frequently encountered. Representative samples of glacier
   meltwater were obtained from Scott Turnerbreen, a `cold-based' glacier
   at 78 degrees N in the Norwegian high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard,
   during the 1993 melt season and analysed for major ion chemistry.
   Laboratory dissolution experiments were also conducted, using suspended
   sediment from the runoff. Significant concentrations of crustal
   weathering derived SO42- are present in the runoff, which is
   characterized by high ratios of SO42-: (SO42- + HCO3-) and high p(CO2).
   Meltwater is not routed subglacially, but flows to the glacier terminus
   through subaerial, ice marginal channels, and partly flows through a
   proglacial icing, containing highly concentrated interstitial waters,
   immediately afront the terminus. The hydrochemistry of the runoff is
   controlled by: (1) seasonal variations in the input of solutes from
   snow- and icemelt; (2) proglacial solute acquisition from the icing; and
   (3) subaerial chemical weathering within saturated, ice-cored lateral
   moraine adjoining drainage channels at the glacier margins, sediment and
   concentrated pore water from which is entrained by flowing meltwater.
   Diurnal variations in solute concentration arise from the net effects of
   variable sediment pore water entrainment and dilution in the ice
   marginal streams. Explanation of the hydrochemistry of Scott Turnerbreen
   requires only one major subaerial flow path, the ice marginal channel
   system, in which seasonally varying inputs of concentrated snowmelt and
   dilute icemelt are modified by seepage or entrainment of concentrated
   pore waters from sediment in lateral moraine, and by concentrated
   interstitial waters from the proglacial icing, supplied by leaching,
   slow drainage at grain intersections or simple melting of the icing
   itself. The ice marginal channels are analogous neither to dilute
   supra/englacial nor to concentrated subglacial flow components. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{The effect of the formation of a major subglacial drainage channel on
   the behaviour of the subglacial drainage system of Haut Glacier
   d'Arolla, Switzerland, was investigated using measurements of borehole
   water level and the electrical conductivity and turbidity of basal
   meltwaters, Electrical conductivity profiles were also measured within
   borehole water columns to identify the water sources driving water level
   changes, and to determine patterns of water circulation in boreholes.
   Prior to channel formation, boreholes showed idiosyncratic and poorly
   coordinated behaviour, Diurnal water level fluctuations were small and
   driven by supraglacial/englacial water inputs, even when boreholes were
   connected to a subglacial drainage system, This system appeared to
   consist of hydraulically impermeable patches interspersed with storage
   spaces, and transmitted a very low water flux, Drainage reorganization,
   which occurred around 31 July, 1993, in response to rapidly rising
   meltwater and rainfall inputs, seems to have involved the creation of a
   connection between an incipient channel and a well established
   channelized system located further down-glacier. Once a major channel
   existed within the area of the borehole array, borehole water level
   fluctuations were forced by discharge-related changes in channel water
   pressure, although a diversity of responses was observed. These included
   (i) synchronous, (ii) damped and lagged, (iii) inverse, and (iv)
   alternating inverse/lagged responses. Synchronous responses occurred in
   boreholes connected directly to the channel, while damped and lagged
   responses occurred in boreholes connected to it by a more resistive
   drainage system. Pressure variations within the channel resulted in
   diurnal transfer of mechanical support for the ice overburden between
   connected and unconnected areas of the bed, producing inverse and
   alternating patterns of water level response. (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons,

Abstract = {{A capacitance probe has been employed to measure the spatial and
   temporal change of soil moisture in a weathered soil profile with
   heterogeneous texture characteristics. Measurements were made to a depth
   of 2 m at intervals of 2 cm. The field work was carried out during a
   wetting-up period in a subtropical monsoonal environment in the Middle
   Hills of Nepal. Calibrations of the frequency readings against
   gravimetric and volumetric soil moisture are compared. It was found that
   the frequency reading correlates much better with the volumetric soil
   moisture. Although the soil is spatially heterogeneous in its particle
   size, porosity and bulk density, it was found that a single regression
   equation can be used to represent the relationship between the frequency
   reading of the capacitance probe and volumetric soil moisture. The
   results demonstrate that the capacitance probe enables the investigation
   of soil moisture variation temporally and spatially at high resolution
   and can measure a wide moisture range. (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment yields from the rolling hills area of the Loess Plateau in
   northern China (10 000-25 000 t km(-2) yr(-1)) are amongst the highest
   in the world. The sediment is believed to derive from both the deep
   gullies that dissect the rolling plateau and the steep cultivated fields
   on the slopes of the mounds between the gullies. However, there are few
   reliable data for erosion rates on the cultivated fields and it is
   suspected that current estimates (10 000-16 000 t km(-2) yr(-1)) based
   on empirical relationships (derived from erosion plot studies) exceed
   the true values. This study sought to address the need for more
   information concerning erosion of the cultivated fields through
   derivation of erosion rates from measurements of rill volume and
   caesium-137 (Cs-137) inventories for typical fields near the village of
   Ansai, Shaanxi Province. The derived erosion rates are discussed and
   compared with estimates based on empirical relationships derived from
   erosion plot data.
   Where erosion rate estimates based on both rill volume data and Cs-137
   inventories are available, they show good agreement in the pattern of
   downslope variation. Both show a sharp decline in erosion rates at a
   slope length of c. 50 m. This is tentatively attributed to a change from
   transport-limited to detachment-limited conditions, where rill incision
   reaches the undisturbed loess at the base of the plough layer. No such
   decline is visible in the predictions based on empirical relationships
   derived from erosion plot data, Further evidence is presented that
   supports the suggestion that these empirical relationships overestimate
   erosion rates at slope lengths in excess of c. 50 m. It is tentatively
   suggested that the rates of soil erosion from sloping cultivated fields
   in the rolling hills area are more likely to lie in the range 8000-10
   000 t km(-2) yr(-1) than in the higher range suggested by the empirical
   relationships. (C) 1998 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{compare the hydrology of two forested basins in West Virginia (WV) (34
   and 39 ha) and one in Pennsylvania (PA) (1134 ha). Precipitation and
   throughfall were measured with funnel/bottle samplers, soil water with
   ceramic-cup suction lysimeters and spring flow/baseflows by grab and
   automatic sampling during the period March 1989 to March 1990. Isotopic
   damping depths, or depths required to reduce the amplitude of subsurface
   oxygen-18 fluctuations to 37\% of the surface amplitude, were generally
   similar for soil water on the larger PA basin, and baseflows and
   headwater spring flows on the smaller WV basins. Computed annual
   isotopic damping depths for these water sources averaged 49 cm using
   soil depth as the flow path length. The equivalent annual mean hydraulic
   diffusivity for the soil flow paths was 21 cm(2) d(-1). Mean transit
   times, based upon an assumed exponential distribution of transit times,
   ranged from 0.2 y for soil water at a depth of 30 cm on the larger
   catchment, to 1.1-1.3 y for most spring flows and 1.4-1.6 y for
   baseflows on the smaller catchments. Baseflow on the larger PA basin and
   flow of one spring on a small WV basin showed no detectable seasonal
   fluctuations in oxygen-18, indicating flow emanated from sources with
   mean transit times greater than about 5 y. Based upon this soil flow
   path approach, it was concluded that seasonal oxygen-18 variations can
   be used to infer mean annual isotopic damping depths and diffusivities
   for soil depths up to approximately 170 cm. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to determine the application of Indian Remote
   Sensing Satellite 1A-Linear Imaging Self scanning (IRS-1A-LISS-I)
   spectral digital data for estimating turbidity in an inland water body.
   IRS-1A-LISS-I spectral digital data for 20 October 1988 for the Tawa
   Reservoir were analysed and compared with field measurements of
   turbidity and used to develop simple and multiple regression equations
   to estimate turbidity in the surface water. The turbidity values were
   positively correlated with increasing wavelength LISS-I bands, 1, 2 and
   3 of the visible region of the spectrum. Simple linear regression
   analyses indicate that LISS-I band 3 (0.62-0.68 mu m) is the best for
   prediction purpose. Multiple regression equations have higher
   correlations (r = 0.91). For validation, the equations were tested using
   LISS-I data for 28 September 1988 for the Tawa Reservoir.
   IRS-1A-LISS-I data provide a solid foundation for further development of
   remote sensing as a practical tool in monitoring water quality. The
   regression technique has strong potential for the future application of
   IRS-1A-LISS-I data in monitoring water quality of inland water bodies
   and estuaries. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Two alternative schemes are presented that are appropriate for the
   representation of runoff routing in large-scale grid-based hydrological
   models and atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). The first
   scheme characterizes routing processes as a single conceptual store. The
   second scheme, developed by Naden (1992), uses the normalized network
   width function to characterize the channel network form and a linear
   solution to the convective diffusion equation of one-dimensional flow to
   characterize the routing effect of a single channel. Both schemes are
   applied to the Severn catchment at the daily time-scale for the period
   1981 to 1990 using a grid resolution of 40 km. Comparable results were
   obtained using both schemes (efficiencies were of the order of 80\% in
   both cases). A combined model using a conceptual reservoir to represent
   hillslope routing and the network-based scheme to represent channel
   routing was developed to investigate the relative roles of hillslope and
   channel routing at the catchment scale. The application of this model
   demonstrated the important role of hillslope routing in reproducing the
   low frequency component of the catchment response. However, in terms of
   goodness-of-fit there was little to choose between the three schemes.
   Consequently, it is recommended that additional a priori knowledge of
   the routing processes should be used to condition the choice of model
   structure. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Land surface parameterizations used in atmospheric general circulation
   models (AGCMs) are one dimensional representations of the transfer of
   energy and water vapour at the earth's surface over grid squares that
   are typically of the order of 10(4) km(2). It is known, however, that
   climate variables and land surface characteristics vary over scales of
   orders of magnitude less than this. It is therefore important that the
   effects of grid-scale aggregation are understood and appropriate
   methodologies for incorporating the significant effects are developed.
   In this paper, an established two-layer bucket scheme is used as a
   vehicle to investigate the effects of aggregating spatially variable
   rainfall and soil moisture fields. The model is applied to two large UK
   catchments, the rivers Severn and Thames, at a daily time-scale using a
   grid scale of 40 km. A comparison with the observed river discharges for
   the period 1981 to 1990 shows that the model can simulate runoff to
   within 1 and 13\% for the Severn and Thames catchments, respectively.
   Distribution functions were introduced into the model to represent
   sub-grid variability of rainfall and available soil water capacity and
   so remove the bias associated with spatial averaging. Distribution
   functions also proved to be a useful tool for analysing the key controls
   on runoff generation at the grid scale and so aid the development of
   large scale grid-based models. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A methodology for calculating strains that accompany mining is used to
   estimate the post-mining modification of the hydraulic conductivity
   field and the change in the regional and local subsurface water system.
   The techniques yield reasonable agreement with recorded changes in water
   levels for reasonable and defensible choices of material parameters in
   validation exercises at an instrumented longwall site. Water level
   changes recorded above the twin panel longwall configuration are complex
   and varied. However, they may be explained through consideration of the
   mining-modified conductivity field alone. Changes in hydraulic
   conductivity are independently corroborated from the results of in situ
   permeability tests, conducted before and after mining, that confirm the
   overall influence of mining-induced strains. These resulting patterns of
   hydraulic conductivity enhancement enable direct explanation of observed
   water level changes. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic thresholds for erosion of fourteen upland mineral and organic
   soils were determined in a hydraulic flume. These soils are from areas
   to be afforested in the United Kingdom. Some of the group are erosion
   resistant but others are susceptible to erosion once denuded of
   vegetation; for example, by preafforestation ploughing. These threshold
   data were required to calibrate a hydraulic model for effective design
   of preafforestation drainage networks on a variety of soils. However,
   simple field measures of soil properties indicative of erosion potential
   would be of value to the forestry industry for management purposes.
   Consequently, hydraulic threshold data were related by linear regression
   methods to basic soil properties, including organic content, grain size,
   bulk density, compression strength and penetration resistance.
   The investigation concluded that four peat soils are not eroded by clear
   water velocities up to 5.7 m s(-1), although a mineral bedload might
   induce erosion at lesser current speeds. Penetration resistance is a
   good field indicator of the degree of humification of the peat soils.
   Although selected physical parameters contribute resistance to water
   erosion, an increased organic content is pre-eminent in reducing erosion
   susceptibility in both organic and mineral soils. Although compressive
   strength was not indicative of soil erodibility, field measurements of
   penetration resistance on a variety of soils could be related to
   hydraulic thresholds of erosion; albeit through the construction of
   discriminant functions interpolated by eye. Consequently, organic
   content (laboratory) or penetration resistance (field) might form the
   basis of classifying upland soils in terms of erodibility.
   Mineral soils differ widely in terms of their erodibility, so that
   subject to further consideration, the use of ploughing for forestry
   cultivation might be appropriate in wider circumstances than presently
   recommended by the Forests and Water Guidelines. Ploughing should be
   acceptable on deep peat providing the underlying mineral soil is not
   exposed in the bottom of the furrow, and furrows are not led from
   mineral soils on to deep peat. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{On the evening of the 7 August 1996 an intense storm occurred over the
   Aras catchment near Biescas in the central Pyrenees. Eighty-seven people
   were killed as a result of the subsequent flood, which hit a campsite
   located on the alluvial fan at the outlet of the 18.8 km(2) catchment.
   This paper presents the main results of a hydromorphological study of
   the event. The Betes subcatchment received the most intense rainfall,
   estimated at somewhat in excess of 250 mm, which resulted in a peak how
   from this tributary of 300 m(3) s(-1). Just downstream from the Betes
   river junction, how in the main channel reached 400 m(3) s(-1),
   increasing to around 500 m(3) s(-1) further downstream. Rainfall in the
   larger Aso tributary was less intense, and in the head reaches flow
   remained within-bank, representing a one in two-year return period
   event. Flow from this tributary did not exceed 100 m(3) s(-1),
   indicating that the Betes subcatchment supplied some 75\% of the how
   from just 28.7\% of the catchment area. The extreme flows caused the
   collapse of a series of sediment trap dams in the Aras channel
   downstream of the Betes junction. This resulted in the addition of 68
   000 m(3) of sediment to an already disastrous event. Data from other
   rain gauges in the area showed both the extremely local nature of the
   event, and the problems of return period analysis for such storms, whose
   peaks are rarely observed at gauges. Together with the high
   geomorphological risks of the zone, this leads to the conclusion that a
   new method of spatial and temporal risk analysis is required for
   infrastructure planning. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Recent understanding of chemical weathering in glacierized catchments
   has been focused on mid-latitude, Alpine catchments; comparable studies
   from the high latitudes are currently lacking. This paper attempts to
   address this deficiency by examining solute provenance, transport and
   denudation in a glacierized catchment at 78 degrees N in the Svalbard
   High Arctic archipelago. Representative samples of snow, glacier ice,
   winter proglacial icing and glacier meltwater were obtained from the
   catchment during spring and summer 1993 and analysed for major ion
   chemistry. Seasonal variations in the composition of glacier meltwater
   occur and are influenced by proglacial solute acquisition from the icing
   at the very start of the melt season, and subsequently by a period of
   discharge of concentrated snowmelt caused by snowpack elution;
   weathering within the ice-marginal channels that drain the glacier,
   particularly carbonation reactions, continues to furnish solute to
   meltwater when suspended sediment concentrations increase later in the
   melt season. Partitioning the solute flux into its various components
   (sea-salt, crustal, aerosol and atmospheric sources) shows that c. 25\%
   of the total flux is sea salt derived, consistent with the maritime
   location of the glacier, and c. 71\% is crustally derived. Estimated
   chemical denudation, 160 meg m(-2) a(-1) sea salt-corrected cation
   equivalent weathering rate, is somewhat low compared with other studied
   glacierized catchments (estimates in the range 450-1000 meg m(-2)
   a(-1)), which is probably attributable to the relatively short melt
   season and low specific runoff in the High Arctic. A positive
   relationship was identified between discharge and CO2 drawdown owing to
   carbonation reactions in turbid meltwater. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{A distributed, dynamic, process-based model for interrill overland how
   that has previously been shown to predict accurately both total runoff
   and runoff hydraulics for a site on semi-arid shrubland is assessed in
   terms of (i) its portability, (ii) its sensitivity to the quality of
   data inputs, and (iii) its sensitivity to the size of cell used in the
   model. It is found that the model can be used at another site, but only
   after modifications to take account of the local controls of runoff
   routing. The model is portable, but not readily so. The model is
   sensitive to both the quality of data input and the size of cell. Data
   input cannot be reduced by use of stochastic distribution of model
   parameters without significant loss of accuracy in model predictions,
   particularly of runoff hydraulics. Larger cells produce poorer
   predictions of the runoff hydrograph. It is concluded that process-based
   modelling of interrill runoff may not be a realistic tool for predicting
   soil erosion, but is one that may be useful for identification of our
   present poor understanding of erosion processes. Such models help to
   define the research agenda for soil erosion studies. (C) 1997 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The main objective of this study has been to test the theories
   describing the pathways and the processes generating runoff from
   rainfall. A small forest catchment in south-eastern Norway has been used
   as a research area. The results of this study agree with previous work
   (Myrabo, 1986), suggesting that the response area concept gives a good
   description of the behaviour of the processes in small catchments in
   moraine terrain in Norway. Maps of the areal distribution of groundwater
   levels at different stream discharges are used, derived from
   measurements at more than 100 observational sites.
   The saturated area and response area in the catchment are controlled by
   the position of the groundwater level. The variations of the measured
   groundwater level, obtained automatically each hour, and at various
   stream discharges, are therefore thoroughly investigated. Correlation
   analysis and comparisons of discharge-groundwater level relationships,
   show distinct hysteresis effects. Threshold groundwater levels that
   indicate the limit for quick runoff from particular parts of the
   catchment have been identified. The behaviour of the
   discharge-groundwater relationship is dependent on location, antecedent
   conditions and size of response area before each precipitation event.

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional non-linear diffusion wave equation is derived from the
   Saint Venant equations with neglect of the inertia terms. This
   non-linear equation has no general analytical solution. Numerical
   schemes are therefore employed to discretize the space and time axes and
   convert the differential equation to difference form. In this study, the
   mixing cell method is used to convert the diffusion wave equation to
   difference form, in which the difference term can be eliminated by
   selecting an optimal space step size Delta x when time step size Delta t
   is given. When the time step size Delta t --> 0, the space step size
   Delta x = Q/(2S(0)BC(k)) where Q is discharge, S-0 is bed slope, B is

Abstract = {{Hydrological models simulate the land phase component of the global
   water cycle and provide a mechanism for evaluating the effects of
   climatic variation and change on water resources, Evapotranspiration
   (ET) is a critical process within such models, This study evaluates
   three different methods for estimating ET in the simple lumped reservoir
   parametric model (SLURP), over a five-year period in the Kootenay Basin
   of eastern British Columbia. The three ET methods were the Morton
   implementation of the Bouchet complementary relationship, the Granger
   modification of Penman's method and the Spittlehouse energy-limited
   versus soil moisture-limited method. We evaluated the three ET methods
   indirectly, based on the ability of the SLURP hydrological model to
   simulate daily stream flow over several annual cycles. Although the ET
   methods affected simulated stream flow differently, the Spittlehouse
   method had more physical significance and gave better agreement between
   simulated and recorded stream flows. The results showed that using an ET
   method that included a soil moisture limitation to ET produced a
   worthwhile improvement in hydrological performance. (C) 1997 John Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper examines geomorphological and botanical changes on the outer
   low elevation portion of the Slave River Delta prior to and after
   impoundment of the Peace River at Hudson's Hope, British Columbia. The
   Slave River Delta deposits are approximately 8300 km(2), about 5\% (400
   km(2)) is defined as the active delta which progrades into Great Slave
   Lake through an active system of distributaries. This active portion of
   the delta is the area studied.
   The Peace River provides approximately 65\% of the annual flow of the
   Slave River. Alteration of the natural flow regime and suspended
   sediment load of the Slave River has resulted from the upstream
   impoundment. Calculations indicate that the annual suspended sediment
   load in the Slave River has decreased by 33\%. Using aerial photographs
   of the Slave Delta taken in 1946 and 1966, prior to damming the Peace
   River, geomorphological change and the spatial changes in plant
   assemblages have been recorded using GIS software. Aerial photographs
   taken in 1977 and 1994 were used in similar fashion to document
   geomorphological and botanical change and rates of change after
   impoundment, The Outer Delta is most susceptible to hydrological and
   suspended sediment changes in the river system. As such it is shown that
   geomorphological development in these Outer Delta landforms has been
   notably reduced since impoundment and changes in plant assemblage
   distribution indicates a drier, less productive environment, Results of
   aerial photo analysis show that the rate of development of distinctive
   cleavage bar islands on the Outer Delta has been notably reduced since
   impoundment. Changes in plant assemblage areas on these islands
   indicates both an autogenic and allogenic change to a drier, less
   productive environment and actual loss, by erosion, of some of the most
   productive Equisetum assemblages. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Snowmelt can be estimated by applying an energy balance to a control
   volume of snow. A major problem with this method is the difficulty of
   obtaining accurate estimates of the turbulent transfers of sensible and
   latent heat. This paper uses a modified form of the Penman-Monteith
   equation, a combined aerodynamic-energy balance approach for calculating
   evaporation from vegetative surfaces, to estimate the energy available
   for snowmelt during large-scale advection. The modification requires
   knowledge of k, the ratio of the energy used for melting to the net
   energy available for phase changes (vaporization and melting).
   Comparisons between the melt flux determined by the Penman-Monteith
   equation and estimates derived from field measurements suggest a value
   of k in the range of 0.90-0.99.
   The modified Penman-Monteith equation is used in a detailed simulation
   of melting of a shallow prairie snow cover. This simulation incorporates
   the effects of a small-scale advection of energy from bare ground to
   adjacent patches. It is demonstrated that the contributions by large-and
   small-scale advective energy transfers to melt depend on the
   interactions between snow-covered area and meteorological variables. (C)

Abstract = {{The stability of water flow in an englacial conduit is examined with
   particular reference to catastrophic outbursts of water. Quasi-steady
   flow of water in a conduit is considered, the conduit being
   simultaneously enlarged by frictional heating and compressed by plastic
   deformation in response to the pressure difference across the tunnel
   wall. The conduit is fed by an ice-dammed reservoir. With the aid of
   simplifying assumptions, we have devised a mathematical model consisting
   of two time-dependent, non-linear, dimensionless ordinary differential
   equations, which describe the time evolution of the conduit
   cross-section and the water depth in the reservoir. The conditions
   leading to different types of time-dependent flow behaviour are
   examined. Regions of the parameter space where the water flow is stable
   and unstable have been identified. In the unstable regime, the process
   of emptying the reservoir has either an oscillatory or an exponential
   character. In the stable regime, the system's return to equilibrium,
   following a perturbation, also exhibits an oscillatory or exponential
   character. Examples of this time-dependent behaviour are presented. The
   model has also been used to study the influence of the glacier, conduit
   and reservoir geometries on the system's stability. The results show
   that an increase in the horizontal area of the water reservoir or an
   increase in the slope of the conduit enhance the likelihood of a sudden
   outburst. However, an increase in the glacier thickness or the conduit
   length stabilizes the equilibria. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   soil samples were divided into four classes: subtalus dry, subtalus wet,
   surface vegetated and surface bare. The size of the individual talus
   soil patches ranged from 0.5 to 12.0 m(2) in area, with bulk density
   ranging from 0.98 to 1.71 kg m(-3) and soil texture ranging from sandy

   values for KCl-extractable NH4- of 3.2 mg N kg(-1), and NO3- of 1.0 mg N
   kg(-1), were comparable with developed alpine soils on Niwot Ridge.
   Average microbial biomass in subtalus soils of 5.4 mg N kg(-1) and total
   N of 1000 mg N kg(-1) were about an order of magnitude lower than alpine
   tundra soils, reflecting the reduced amount of vegetation in talus
   areas. However, these measurements in surface-vegetated patches of talus
   were comparable with the well-developed soils on Niwot Ridge. These
   measurements in talus of microbial biomass, total N and KC1-extractable
   NH4+ and NO3- show that there is sufficient biotically conditioned
   `soil' within talus fields to influence the solute content of
   interstitial waters. Mean NO3- concentrations of 20 mu eq 1(-1) from 29
   samples of subtalus water were significantly higher than the 6.7 mu eq
   1(-1) in snow, while NH4+ concentrations in subtalus water of 0.7 mu eq
   1(-1) was significantly lower than in snow at 5.2 mu eq 1(-1) (p =
   0.001). Nitrate concentrations in subtalus water were significantly (p <
   0.0001) correlated with concentrations of geochemical weathering
   products such as Ca2+ (r(2) = 0.84) and silica (r(2) = 0.49). The
   correlation of NO3- in subtalus water with geochemical weathering
   products suggests that NO3- concentrations in subtalus water increased
   with increased residence time, consistent with a biological source for
   this subtalus water NO3-. The high NO3- concentrations in subtalus water
   compared with atmospheric deposition of NO3-; suggests that No-3(-) in
   talus fields may contribute to NO3- in stream waters of high-elevation
   catchments. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper uses a numerical simulation to develop an expression for
   predicting infiltration of water into a frozen soil. The simulation is
   based on the continuity, energy and momentum equations, and uses
   well-known and accepted procedures to define the transport phenomena and
   the thermophysical properties of frozen soil. A parametric equation
   describing the variation in cumulative infiltration with time during
   quasi-steady-state flow in medium-and fine-textured soils is presented.
   The expression relates infiltration to initial soil saturation, soil
   surface saturation, soil hydraulic conductivity, initial soil
   temperature and infiltration opportunity time. Infiltration estimates by
   the expression demonstrate reasonable agreement with those determined by
   field measurement. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrological sensitivities to long-term climate change of a
   watershed in Eastern Canada were analysed using a deterministic
   watershed runoff model developed to simulate watershed acidification.
   This model was modified to study atmospheric change effects in the
   watershed. Water balance modelling techniques, modified for assessing
   climate effects, were developed and tested for a watershed using
   atmospheric change scenarios from both state of the art general
   circulation models and a series of hypothetical scenarios. The model
   computed daily surface, inter- and groundwater hows from the watershed.
   The moisture, infiltration and recharge rate are also computed in the
   soil reservoirs. The thirty years of simulated data can be used to
   evaluate the effects of climatic change on soil moisture, recharge rate
   and surface and subsurface flow systems. The interaction between surface
   and subsurface water is discussed in relation to climate change. These
   hydrological results raise the possibility of major environmental and
   socioeconomic difficulties and have significant implications for future
   water resource planning and management. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Estimation of groundwater recharge to an unconfined aquifer is studied
   using analytical and numerical techniques and results are compared with
   field observations. There is an acute need for such estimation in water
   balance studies in arid climates, and the case study in this paper is
   for such a region. The wetting front movement in the unsaturated zone
   depends on antecedent soil moisture, the ponded water depth and its
   duration, and on the position of the water table and the hydraulic
   properties of the unsaturated zone. A hydraulic connection between the
   recharge basin and the aquifer is not immediately established because
   the wetting front is unsaturated.
   A numerical model is applied to estimate recharge in an arid-zone wadi,
   and its validity is tested by comparing it with an analytical solution
   of the equations. The calculated recharge values matched the piezometric
   levels observed at a well site at the edge of the wadi channel. The
   total recharge depths found by integration in the time domain provided a
   good estimate of the transmitted volume of water per unit length of wadi
   channel. The findings were confirmed by runoff volume measurements at
   gauging stations located in the basin. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Stream bed temperature profiles were monitored continuously during water
   year 1990 and 1991 (WY90 and 91) in two New Mexico arroyos, similar in
   their meteorological features and dissimilar in their hydrological
   features. Stream bed temperature profiles between depths of 30 and 300
   cm were examined to determine whether temporal changes in temperature
   profiles represent accurate indicators of the timing, depth and duration
   of percolation in each stream bed. These results were compared with
   stream flow, air temperature, and precipitation records for WY90 and 91,
   to evaluate the effect of changing surface conditions on temperature
   profiles. Temperature profiles indicate a persistently high thermal
   gradient with depth beneath Grantline Arroyo, except during a
   semi-annual thermal reversal in spring and autumn. This typifies the
   thermal response of dry sediments with low thermal conductivities. High
   thermal gradients were disrupted only during infrequent stream flows,
   followed by rapid re-establishment of high gradients. The stream bed
   temperature at 300 cm was unresponsive to individual precipitation or
   stream how during WY90 and 91. This thermal pattern provides strong
   evidence that most seepage into Grantline Arroyo failed to percolate at
   a sufficient rate to reach 300 cm before being returned to the
   atmosphere. A distinctly different thermal pattern was recorded beneath
   Tijeras Arroyo. Low thermal gradients between 30 and 300 cm and large
   diurnal variations in temperature, suggest that stream flow created
   continuous, advection-dominated heat transport for over 300 days,
   annually. Beneath Tijeras Arroyo, low thermal gradients were interrupted
   only briefly during periodic, dry summer conditions. Comparisons of
   stream dow records for WY90 and 91 with stream bed temperature profiles
   indicate that independent analysis of thermal patterns provides accurate
   estimates of the timing, depth and duration of percolation beneath both
   arroyos. Stream flow loss estimates indicate that seepage rates were 15
   times greater for Tijeras Arroyo than for Grantline Arroyo, which
   supports qualitative conclusions derived from analysis of stream bed
   temperature responses to surface conditions. (C) 1997 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of source areas and associated residence times
   of water in the catchment are significant factors controlling the annual
   cycles of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in Deer Creek
   (Summit County, Colorado). During spring snowmelt (April-August 1992),
   stream DOC concentrations increased with the rising limb of the
   hydrograph, peaked before maximum discharge, then declined rapidly as
   melting continued. We investigated catchment sources of DOC to
   streamflow, measuring DOC in tension lysimeters, groundwater wells, snow
   and streamflow. Lysimeter data indicate that near-surface soil horizons
   are a primary contributor of DOC to streamflow during spring snowmelt.
   Concentrations of DOC in the lysimeters decrease rapidly during the melt
   period, supporting the hypothesis that hydrological flushing of
   catchment soils is the primary mechanism affecting the temporal
   variation of DOC in Deer Creek. Time constants of DOC flushing,
   characterizing the exponential decay of DOC concentration in the upper
   soil horizon, ranged from 10 to 30 days for the 10 lysimeter sites.
   Differences in the rate of hushing are influenced by topographical
   position, with near-stream riparian soils hushed more quickly than soils
   located further upslope. Variation in the amount of distribution of
   accumulated snow, and asynchronous melting of the snowpack across the
   landscape, staggered the onset of the spring flush throughout the
   catchment, prolonging the period of increased concentrations of DOC in
   the stream. Streamflow integrates the catchment-scale flushing
   responses, yielding a time constant associated with the recession of DOC
   in the stream channel (84 days) that is significantly longer than the
   time constants observed for particular locations in the upper soil. (C)

Abstract = {{The shape, timing and peak flow of a stream flow hydrograph are
   significantly influenced by spatial and temporal variability in rainfall
   and watershed characteristics. Depending upon the size and shape of a
   watershed, its hydrological response is closely linked with storm
   dynamics. On an urban watershed a rain storm moving in the direction of
   flow produces a higher peak than it would if it were moving in the
   opposite direction. The effect of storm speed on peak discharge is much
   less for rapidly moving storms than for storms moving at about the same
   speed as the flow velocity. In a relatively homogeneous watershed the
   most important effect of spatial variability of rainfall occurs in the
   timing and shape of the runoff hydrograph. Temporally variable rainfall
   leads to higher peak flow than does constant rainfall. Significant
   errors in the prediction of runoff occur when an equivalent uniform
   hillslope is used to represent a heterogeneous hillslope. When average
   soil properties are used instead of spatially variable properties,
   significant differences are observed in infiltration. Spatially variable
   roughness alters the flow dynamics significantly. (C) 1997 by John Wiley

Abstract = {{An automatic calibration scheme for the HBV model (ACSH) was developed.
   The ACSH was based on the physical significance of the model parameters
   and structure. The inference of hydrologists in the manual calibration
   was adopted as the guideline. A slight modification of the model
   structure of the soil routine was suggested to avoid interdependence of
   the parameters. In total nine parameters, except the snow routine, Fc
   and MAXBAS, were calibrated automatically in two stages; first the soil
   moisture routine and then the others. There are six sets in two stages
   in total. Using the Powell method, the parameters in each step were
   calibrated simultaneously with carefully selected objective functions,
   and in particular a powerful objective function for the soil moisture
   routine. The steps were in a fixed order in the ACSH according to the
   model structure. The optimal values of the model parameters were stable,
   with the different initial values varying in considerable ranges. The
   automatic calibration gave the same model performance as the manual
   calibration when the ACSH was tested in two basins. The automatic
   calibration can thus be used as a reference or as an alternative
   solution of the model. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Transportation, sublimation and accumulation of snow dominate snow cover
   development in the Arctic and produce episodic high evaporative fluxes.
   Unfortunately, blowing snow processes are not presently incorporated in
   any hydrological or meteorological models. To demonstrate the
   application of simple algorithms that represent blowing snow processes,
   monthly snow accumulation, relocation and sublimation fluxes were
   calculated and applied in a spatially distributed manner to a 68-km(2)
   catchment in the low Arctic of north-western Canada. The model uses a
   Landsat-derived vegetation classification and a digital elevation model
   to segregate the basin into snow `sources' and `sinks'. The model then
   relocates snow from sources to sinks and calculates in-transit
   sublimation loss. The resulting annual snow accumulation in specific
   landscape types was compared with the result of intensive surveys of
   snow depth and density. On an annual basis, 28\% of annual snowfall
   sublimated from tundra surfaces whilst 18\% was transported to sink
   areas. Annual blowing snow transport to sink areas amounted to an
   additional 16\% of annual snowfall to shrub-tundra and an additional
   182\% to drifts. For the catchment, 19.5\% of annual snowfall sublimated
   from blowing snow, 5.8\% was transported into the catchment and 86.5\%
   accumulated on the ground. The model overestimated snow accumulation in
   the catchment by 6\%. The application demonstrates that winter
   precipitation alone is insufficient to calculate snow accumulation and
   that blowing snow processes and landscape patterns govern the spatial
   distribution and total accumulation of snow water equivalent over the
   winter. These processes can be modelled by relatively simple algorithms,
   and, when distributed by landscape type over the catchment, produce
   reasonable estimates of snow accumulation and loss in wind-swept
   regions. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   Evaporation estimates were found to be particularly sensitive to vapour

   temperature. A quantitative analysis showed that: (1) systematic errors
   in vapour pressure data influenced evaporation estimates inversely to
   more or less the same magnitude for both monthly and daily cases; (2)
   systematic errors in wind speed and temperature data influenced
   evaporation estimates inversely to the magnitude of about a half and a
   quarter of the magnitude of the influence of vapour pressure errors,
   respectively; and (3) evaporation estimates were much more sensitive to

Abstract = {{Development of hydrological models for seasonal and real-time runoff
   forecast in rivers of high alpine catchments is useful for management of
   water resources. The conceptual models for this purpose are based on a
   temperature index and/or energy budget and can be either lumped or
   distributed over the catchment area. Remote sensing satellite data are
   most useful to acquire near real-time geophysical parameters in order to
   input to the distributed forecasting models. In the present study,
   integration of optical satellite remote sensing-derived information was
   made with ground meteorological and hydrological data, and predetermined
   catchment morphological parameters, to study the feasibility of
   application of a distributed temperature index snowmelt runoff model to
   one of the high mountainous catchments in the Italian Alps, known as
   Cordevole River Basin. Five sets of Landsat Multispectral Scanning
   System (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) computer-compatible tapes (CCTs)
   were processed using digital image processing techniques in order to
   evaluate the snow cover variation quantitatively. Digital elevation
   model, slope and aspect parameters were developed and used during
   satellite data processing. The satellite scenes were classified as snow,
   snow under transition and snow free areas. A second-order polynomial fit
   has been attempted to approximate the snow depletion and to estimate
   daily snow cover areal extent for three elevation zones of the catchment
   separately. Model performance evaluation based on correlation
   coefficient, Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient and percentage volume deviation
   indicated very good simulation between measured and computed discharges
   for the entire snowmelt period. The use of average temperature values
   computed from the maximum and minimum temperatures into the model was
   studied and a suitable algorithm was proposed. (C) 1997 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The chemical inputs by rainfall, throughfall and stemflow were studied
   in a pine plantation located in Pierces Creek Forest, Canberra,
   Australia. Three treatments were included in the study: a control (C)
   and two fertilizer treatments. The first fertilizer treatment (F)
   involved two applications of mixed fertilizers at high rates, the second
   (IL) involved application of a complete liquid fertilizer with
   irrigation, so as to remove nutrient and water restrictions to growth.
   The application rates of nutrients were higher for IL than F. Net inputs
   of elements in throughfall and stemflow, obtained by subtracting the
   amounts in the rainfall, were compared for different treatments.
   For cations (the sum of Ca, Mg, Na and K), the treatment effect on
   leaching by throughfall and stemflow was IL > F > C; but the F to C
   differences were greater for throughfall than stemflow. The effects were
   almost entirely due to increases in concentration, rather than the
   amount of rainfall becoming throughfall or stemflow.
   The concentration of nitrogen (as NH4 or NO3) in throughfall or stemflow
   could be lower or higher than in rainfall, indicating net removal or
   leaching, respectively. Net removal occurred for most rainfall events
   for the control treatment, for a substantial number of events for
   treatment F, but for few events for treatment IL. The ammonium ion was
   preferentially removed from throughfall, and nitrate from stemflow.
   Transfers of potassium and total nitrogen by litterfall, throughfall and
   stemflow were also studied. The proportions of potassium and nitrogen
   being transferred by these processes showed little difference between
   treatments; the overall values for potassium being 60\% by throughfall,
   4\% by stemflow and 36\% by litterfall. In contrast the transfer of
   nitrogen was dominated by litterfall (81\%), with 18\% by throughfall
   and 1\% by stemflow. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In this first paper of two, a numerical simulation model capable of
   simulating the spatial variability of rainfall partitioning within a
   canopy is presented. The second paper details how the model is
   parameterized, and some testing of its capabilities.
   The first stage of the model is to derive the mature canopy structure.
   This is achieved through simplified individual tree structures and a
   random placement routine based on a modified Poisson distribution.
   Following this the spatial discretization for throughfall is attained as
   a series of layers of triangles with a tree trunk at every apex. The
   number of layers is derived from the leaf area index through a modified
   Poisson distribution. Seasonal variation in the deciduous canopy is
   simulated through a time vector routine. The rainfall partitioning
   section of the model is based upon the Rutter model which has been
   modified to each individual triangle layer. The main feature of this
   model is that it offers a method of simulating rainfall partitioning at
   a scale that is a function of the size of the elementary physical
   components (tree and leaf scale). This can be used to investigate soil
   moisture variations under a canopy, or to study the variations within
   the forest hydrological processes themselves. (C) 1997 John Wiley \&

   Process., 11, 1509-1523], is parameterized, and the testing of its
   capabilities. A majority of the input parameters required for running
   the model can be derived from physical measurements. The remainder can
   be derived from previous forest interception studies. The measured
   values used in model testing were from a mixed oak and sweet chestnut
   plantation on the outskirts of Bristol, UK. A sensitivity analysis of
   the model has been carried out. The importance to throughfall of
   potential evaporation rate, storage capacity and gap area within the
   canopy is highlighted. For stemflow the proportion of tree crown area
   generating stemflow is the most important parameter. This is largely a
   reflection of the model structure.
   The model has been tested with field data to evaluate its ability for
   predicting: total throughfall and stemflow for individual events;
   spatial variability in rainfall partitioning; and temporal dynamics of
   throughfall. The model was able reproduce these data sets; however the
   field data (from an intensive plot study) was not adequate to allow
   complete validation of the model. The novel feature of the model
   (spatial variability of rainfall partitioning) was shown to be quite
   well simulated. Suggestions are given for using this type of model in
   future research. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Six drip waters, which were actively depositing stalagmites in Lower
   Cave, Bristol, were analysed both for discharge and luminescence
   properties. Drip discharges were determined for two different years, and
   show a complex response to surface precipitation variations. Inter
   annual variability in drip discharge is demonstrated to be significantly
   higher than intra-annual variability, and discharge was demonstrated
   both to increase and decrease non-linearly with increased precipitation.
   Drip waters demonstrate a correlation between their luminescence
   intensity and drip discharge, with increased luminescence in winter as
   more organic matter is flushed through the aquifer. The strength of the
   relationship between luminescence intensity and discharge increases with
   increased discharge. The results presented here have implications for
   the palaeoenvironmental interpretation of annual growth laminae and the
   growth rates of stalagmite samples. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares various ways of quantifying the importance of
   land-atmosphere feedback. A widely used land surface hydrology model is
   used in coupled (to a planetary boundary layer model) and uncoupled
   modes to compare the adequacy of different feedback indices. It is found
   that existing feedback indices are primarily based on `one factor at a
   time' sensitivity analysis and cannot adequately capture the interaction
   between land and atmosphere. A new index is used which combines
   factorial design concepts and traditional sensitivity analysis. This
   index is shown to capture and quantify the strength of interaction
   between land surface parameters and atmosphere. To assess the effects of
   forcing characteristics on the stand alone model sensitivity, several
   ways to specify near-surface atmospheric conditions are evaluated. It is
   found that commonly used forcing conditions (e.g. model generated or
   observed time-series of nearsurface atmospheric variables) may not be
   adequate to mimic the coupled model environment for evaluating the land
   surface representations. The partially coupled model sensitivity is
   shown to capture a major feedback loop related to water holding
   capacity, surface fluxes and near-surface atmospheric processes. These
   results suggest that sensitivity from the stand alone model should be
   interpreted with caution and future evaluations should strive to
   incorporate land-atmosphere feedback, at least within a partially
   coupled model. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of FLOODNET is to provide a communications and data distribution
   facility specifically designed to meet the demanding temporal
   requirements of flood monitoring within the European Union (EU).
   Currently, remotely sensed data are not fully utilized for flood
   applications because potential users are not familiar with the procedure
   for acquiring the data and do not have a defined route for obtaining
   help in processing and interpreting the data. FLOODNET will identify the
   potential user groups within the EU and will, by demonstration,
   education and the use of telematics, increase the awareness of users to
   the capabilities of earth observation (EO) and the means by which they
   can acquire EO data. FLOODNET will act as a filter between users and
   satellite operation planners to help assign priorities for data
   acquisition against previously agreed criteria. The network will
   encourage a user community and will facilitate cross-sector information
   transfer, particularly between `flood experts' and administrative
   decision makers. The requirement for two levels of flood mapping is
   identified: (1) a rapid, `broad-brush' approach to assess the general
   flood situation and identify areas at greatest risk and in need of
   immediate assistance; (2) a detailed mapping approach, less critical in
   time, suitable for input to hydrological models or for flood risk
   evaluation. A likely networking technology is outlined, the basic
   functionality of a FLOODNET demonstrator is described and some of the
   economic benefits of the network are identified. (C) 1997 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{In hydrological modelling of runoff processes, including water balance,
   various input data and parameters can be acquired or estimated by the
   use of remote sensing (RS) techniques. The acquisition and use of
   synoptic RS areal information rather than traditional point information
   is an important issue in hydrology. Hydrological models allow
   runoff/water balance in catchments to be calculated and flow routing
   within flow channels to be done. For runoff and water balance
   computations land use, soil moisture, detection of snow and ice, digital
   terrain models (DTM), as well as hydrometeorological information and
   discharge are important. For flow routing, water level information,
   geometric-topographic information such as cross-sections for normal and
   flood conditions, coefficient of roughness and velocity of flow and its
   cross-sectional distribution are required. In addition, water level
   information (lower and upper level) is needed for shipping and for
   design purposes.
   In the German part of the River Rhine catchment, several focus areas in
   the December 1993-January 1994 and January 1995 floods were covered with
   RS data {[}ERS-1 and airborne SAR. both C-band VV, passive microwave
   (18.7, 36.5, 89 GHz), TIR, UV, aerial photographs (bw PAN, b/w NIR)I,
   giving a good opportunity for a comparison of methods. Evaluation is
   still continuing. The importance of soil saturation for flood generation
   and, therefore, for flood monitoring, was shown on this occasion. The
   use of ER SAR data for soil moisture estimation is currently being
   investigated by the Federal Institute of Hydrology. Also, the need for
   emergency schemes for data acquisition and easy, quick and affordable RS
   data dissemination was demonstrated. The assimilation of RS data with
   GIS information such as DTMs, including relevant topographic features
   like dams. which is omitted in currently available raster digital
   elevation models, is promising. RS altimetry techniques can be a step
   towards high resolution DTMs for hydrological purposes. Ground truth
   reference data are still needed. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study, undertaken by Geoimage, was the setting up of a
   fast and precise location method of flooded areas over two sites in
   southern France. The use of satellite imagery seemed to be the
   appropriate tool for this study.
   Two types of flood had to be distinguished: (i) an oceanic flood, of
   long duration characteristic, and of low intensity on the Rhone Valley,
   (ii) a torrential flood, of short duration characteristic, but of high
   intensity, on the Var Valley. As we distributed of ERS-1 images over
   both sites, during the floods, we could test our methodology. A
   multitemporal approach using ERS-1 images in PRI mode, acquired before,
   during and after the flood, was set up. In the case of oceanic flood,
   the radar images characteristic answers, enabled us to extract and
   identify areas under water at each date of acquisition of the images.
   Therefore, if we distribute images at each step of the flood, its
   evolution can be precisely reconstituted (in terms of time and surface).
   In the case of torrential flood, it is more difficult to localize the
   flood with precision. This can be explained by the change of water
   surface, which has a large swell in this case. Radars are sensitive to
   these changes in the turbidity, an interaction occurs and thus the
   results were `turned off. Nevertheless, simulation studies from other
   satellite data make possible the location of more or less strong
   hydrological risk accident areas. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{GAF examined, under contract to DARA (German Space Agency), the
   applicability of ERS-1 SAR data for flood mapping under operational
   conditions. The flood event investigated was the flooding in the Rhine
   valley in winter 1993-1994.
   In order to carry out an examination close to the end-user needs, the
   specific user requests concerning information about flood events were
   identified. The mapping accuracy in view of the flood extent and the
   flood level, the production of flood maps as well as the demonstration
   of the runoff turned out to be the most interesting points. The specific
   user information needs were considered in the project objectives to
   define the applicability as well as the deficits of ERS-1 data
   concerning an operational use for flood mapping. After a detailed
   analysis of the time aspects of the traditional mapping method and a
   satellite data analysis, a visual interpretation as well as an automatic
   classification were applied, including various filter steps to derive
   the flood boundary. As a result, the visual interpretation proved to be
   the more accurate method. Crucial domains for both the visual
   interpretation and the automatic classification turned out to be
   settlements, forests and bushes as well as regions with layover and
   foreshortening effects. The comparison between the flood level derived
   from satellite data and the flood level registered by the water
   authority boards brought a height difference which ranged between 0.5
   and 2.0 m. The relatively coarse resolution and problems with correct
   interpretation of the flood line proved to be the reason for this
   difference. In general the results are convenient, but in relation to
   field measurements of the water level they are too inaccurate. A cost
   and benefit analysis as well as a proposal for an operational GIS system
   using ERS-1 SAR data are still under investigation. (C) 1997 John Wiley

Abstract = {{The growing availability of multi-temporal satellite data has increased
   opportunities for monitoring large rivers from space. A variety of
   passive and active sensors operating in the visible and microwave range
   are currently operating, or planned, which can estimate inundation area
   and delineate flood boundaries. Radar altimeters show great promise for
   directly measuring stage variation in large rivers. It also appears to
   be possible to obtain estimates of river discharge from space, using
   ground measurements and satellite data to construct empirical curves
   that relate water surface area to discharge. Extrapolation of these
   curves to ungauged sites may be possible for the special case of braided
   rivers.
   Where clouds, trees and floating vegetation do not obscure the water
   surface, high-resolution visible/infrared sensors provide good
   delineation of inundated areas. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors
   can penetrate clouds and can also detect standing water through emergent
   aquatic plants and forest canopies. However, multiple frequencies and
   polarizations are required for optimal discrimination of various
   inundated vegetation cover types. Existing single-polarization,
   fixed-frequency SARs are not sufficient for mapping inundation area in
   all riverine environments. In the absence of a space-borne
   multi-parameter SAR, a synergistic approach using single-frequency,
   fixed-polarization SAR and visible/infrared data will provide the best
   results over densely vegetated river floodplains. (C) 1997 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Recent years have been marked by a continuous availability of spatial
   SAR data since the launch of the European remote sensing satellite
   (ERS-1) in 1991. Consequently, remote sensing techniques now offer an
   opportunity to map flood inundation fields caused by river overflow or
   waterlogging in environments characterized by frequent cloud cover.
   Indeed, inundation fields can clearly be seen on ERS-1 SAR images taken
   during flooding periods. However, such an identification can be
   constrained by the similarity in behaviour between water surfaces and
   other features of the landscape such as extended asphalt areas,
   permanent water bodies and less illuminated slopes. For consistent flood
   inundation extent mapping a more robust approach is required. This is
   provided by a conceptual flood inundation index that is physically sound
   in relation to radar imaging. Moreover, this index has proved to be
   useful for highlighting soils located within inundation fields and
   having significantly different internal drainage. The results achieved
   in the frame-work of the research must be seen in the context of
   intensive use of remote sensing data to support decision methods for
   sustainable management of land and water resources. Such decision
   support methods could be provided by river hydraulic models aimed at
   assessing environmental effects of inundation floods and at early flood
   warning systems. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   together with conditions under which they can or cannot be relaxed. It
   is concluded that it may be necessary to move towards spatially explicit
   solutions of the governing equations if the underlying q-D relationships
   are to be modified.
   The simplicity of TOPMODEL invites its use as a submodel within a range
   of geomorphological and ecological models that are driven by hydrology.
   Some example applications are outlined for both soil erosion and

Abstract = {{This paper analyses the significance of the entropy concept in the
   topography parameterization within the model TOPMODEL proposed by Beven
   and Kirkby (1979), by means of the hydrological behaviour of an
   experimental basin in southern Italy. For a significant number of flood
   events recorded at the basin outlet, the performance of TOPMODEL for
   different spatial distributions of the topographic index, 1n(a/tan
   beta), has been observed. Performance is related to the information
   content estimated as an entropy measure, corresponding to each of the
   spatial distributions of the topographic index, with the aim of
   identifying the procedures most suitable to represent the hydrological
   process of rainfall-runoff.
   The results obtained have shown that for flood events corresponding to
   brief, heavy precipitation, some procedures provide better performances
   than others. Moreover, these improvements are justified by greater
   information content in the corresponding spatial distributions of the
   topographic index.
   Finally, TOPMODEL performances for some procedures have been analysed,
   varying the resolution scale of the topographic index. For analogous
   hydrological performances, scale change produced variations in some of
   the subsurface hydraulic parameters. These variations were proportional
   to a spatial variability measure of the topographic index distribution,
   derived from the corresponding information content. (C) 1997 by John

Abstract = {{The MATLAB SIMULINK programming language is applied to the TOPMODEL
   rainfall-runoff model. SIMULINK requires a good recognition of model
   dynamics, which has been achieved here in a version based on the first
   TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979). Introducing the topographic index
   distribution in a vector form allows the generalization and
   simplification of the SIMULINK structure. The SIMULINK version of
   TOPMODEL has a very easy to understand graphical representation, which
   shows, in a straightforward way, all the physical interactions that take
   place in the model. Moreover, owing to its modular structure it is easy
   to add new and/or develop old submodels, depending on the available data
   and the goal of the modelling. In the example given here TOPMODEL was
   extended by two submodels representing the soil moisture and evaporation
   distribution in the catchment. Preparation of the data and presentation
   of the results is done in MATLAB. Discharge predictions and spatial
   patterns of hydrological response are demonstrated for a separate
   validation period. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{TOPMODEL was calibrated to a small catchment using precipitation and
   runoff data. Acceptable fits of simulated and observed runoff were
   obtained during both the calibration and validation periods. Predictions
   of groundwater levels using this calibration did not agree well with
   observations at the 37 points within the catchment where groundwater
   levels were measured, including three locations with continuous
   recordings. Groundwater level observations at one single point in time,
   however, sufficed to calibrate new topographic-soil indices that
   improved the prediction of the local groundwater levels at the observed
   tubes. This suggests that spatially distributed calibration data are
   necessary to exploit reliably TOPMODEL's ability to predict spatially
   distributed hydrology. The mean or recalibrated transmissivity values at
   these 37 points differed from the catchment mean as determined by the
   precipitation-runoff calibration. Thus, while groundwater information
   can help in predicting groundwater levels at specific locations,
   increasing the number of local groundwater level measurements is not
   sufficient to improve the spatially distributed representation of
   subsurface flow by TOPMODEL for the catchment as a whole, as long as the
   groundwater information is not integrated in the precipitation-runoff
   calibration. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A simple, generalized saturated zone formulation is presented in this
   paper to relax the assumption of an exponential function originally made
   in TOPMODEL. This saturated zone model is based on the concept of a
   `discharge : relative storage' (Q Delta S) function which is derived
   empirically, using recession curve analysis, and may be of arbitrary
   form. The generalized formulation is applied to the Seternbekken
   MINIFELT catchment in Norway, where detailed distributed water table
   data have been measured. These water table data are used to suggest an
   empirical, power law modification of the topographic a/tan beta index.
   Results for the simulation through time of discharges and water table
   depths at a few locations show that the generalized saturated zone
   formulation is as efficient a simulator of the observed data as a
   conventional TOPMODEL, but requires one parameter less to be calibrated.
   The simulation of detailed water table distributions is only approximate
   in both cases. The modified power law index shows only a small
   improvement but provides a basis for a discussion of possible sources of
   error in the TOPMODEL assumptions for this site. (C) 1997 by John Wiley

Abstract = {{Increasing pressure on the tropical environment requires a more thorough
   understanding of hydrological processes as part of reconciling the
   conflicting demands of economic development vis-a-vis sustainable land
   management. Using TOPMODEL, a physically based semi-distributed
   topohydrological model, we test its validity in modelling the stream
   flow dynamics (hydrograph) in a 1 ha tropical rainforest catchment in
   French Guiana. Another objective is through field validation of TOPMODEL
   to ascertain possible runoff generation mechanisms. The field validation
   of the temporal and spatial hydrodynamics across a rainfall-runoff event
   reveals that TOPMODEL may be suited for applications to this particular
   tropical rainforest environment; in fact, this is possibly the first
   successful application of such a model within the humid tropics. The
   main reasons why the model was successful are the presumed low hydraulic

Abstract = {{The hydrological recovery of watersheds from disturbances such as fire
   and harvest can change the magnitude and distribution of flow paths as
   the canopy regenerates. The spatial distribution of net water input to
   the soil-topography system is mediated by vegetation patterns through
   the processes of interception, evapotranspiration and snowmelt. We have
   previously described RHESSys, a distributed model of water and carbon
   flux with a prescribed canopy cover. Although the canopy structure
   varied spatially it did not change through time. We present an expanded
   model in which carbon and nitrogen are dynamically coupled with
   distributed hydrology. The model fixes and allocates canopy carbon
   annually to reflect changes in climate forcing. We test the interactions
   of the forest ecosystem to distributed hydrology through controlled
   experiments. In the first experiment, we prescribe canopy cover and
   examine the sensitivity of the hydrological outputs to the distribution
   of vegetation. The canopy distribution is found to have significant
   effects on simulated hydrological outputs where evaporative demand
   exceeds available water. In a second experiment we simulate the canopy
   leaf area index (LAI) across the topography and through time. The model
   is executed over 100 years using repeated 10-year meteorological records
   to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of LAI. Annual
   precipitation and temperature differences result in temporally
   fluctuating LAI about a reasonably stable long-term mean. The
   topographical position has a strong effect on local forest canopy
   characteristics. As expected, simulated ecosystem processes are found to
   be sensitive to rooting depth in more water limited environments. (C)

Title = {{Seasonal modelling of catchment water balance: A two-level cascading
   modification of TOPMODEL to increase the realism of spatio-temporal
   processes}},

Abstract = {{A general problem of hydrological modelling is parameter identification
   for the driving processes. To examine the longterm dynamics of the water
   balance of a small (4.2 km(2)) forested catchment in south-east Germany
   (Lehstenbach), TOPMODEL has been adapted as a two-level cascading
   approach. Only the lower cascade is allowed to respond dynamically. This
   modified TOPMODEL version accounts for the observations that surface
   runoff only takes place in a small portion of the catchment and that
   water flow in large portions of the catchment occurs through groundwater
   aquifers with a lateral recharge to the downslope regions, Water from an
   upper catchment region is transferred to a lower storage. The border
   between the two areas is represented as a topographic index (ATB)
   threshold that can be varied in the model. The best fits are obtained if
   only 60\% of the catchment area is allowed to react dynamically. A
   substantial improvement of the runoff description has been achieved by a
   moderate increase of model complexity. Results of a Monte Carlo
   simulation showed that the model structure has a flat global optimal
   solution.
   In order to quantify the boundary conditions, we combined direct
   estimates of tree and understorey transpiration, maps of tree age and
   understorey cover to estimate empirically the total catchment
   evapotranspiration. The context of a dynamic hydrological model allows
   an evaluation of ecological data in the context of catchment scale
   dynamics. Vapour pressure deficit can be assumed to be the major driver
   of vegetation-atmosphere water transfer. Soil moisture does not affect
   tree transpiration in this catchment. The results show that
   transpiration measurements can be scaled to the catchment scale in spite
   of variations between sites of up to 100\%. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{An extension of TOPMODEL was developed for rainfall-runoff simulation in
   agricultural watersheds equipped with tile drains. Tile drain functions
   are incorporated into the framework of TOPMODEL. Nine possible flow
   generation scenarios are suggested for tile-drained watersheds and
   applied in the modelling procedure. In the model development, two
   methods of simulation of the flow in the unsaturated zone were compared:
   the traditional, physically based storage approach and a new approach
   using a transfer function. A regionalized sensitivity analysis was used
   to determine the sensitivity of parameters and to compare the behaviour
   of the transfer function with that of the simple storage-related
   formulation. The number of accepted combinations of parameter values, on
   average, was higher for the transfer function approach than when using a
   Monte Carlo method of parameter estimation. Since the rainfall-runoff
   response pattern tends to vary seasonally, seven events distributed
   throughout a year were used in the sensitivity analysis to investigate
   the seasonal variation of the hydrological characteristics. (C) 1997 by

Abstract = {{The Vallcebre research catchments are located in the south-eastern
   Pyrenees, in an area of diverse land use and varying levels of
   degradation, including forested hillslopes, abandoned agricultural
   terraces and badland areas. Outside the badlands, the hydrological
   response is controlled by saturation mechanisms. Between September and
   June the spatial patterns of saturated areas and soil moisture are
   determined by subsurface flow, modified by the premature saturation of
   the inner parts of agricultural terraces, and the negative soil moisture
   anomalies induced by forest patches overgrown in grassland areas. During
   summer, this behaviour ceases because of soil moisture depletion and
   badland surfaces are the only hydrologically active areas, producing
   excess runoff in response to the intense rainstorms. During the
   beginning and the ending of the wet season, the saturation of active
   areas shows a hysteretic behaviour that breaks the linearity between the
   mean water reserve of the basin and the relative saturated area. (C)

Abstract = {{The effects of basin size on low-flow stream chemistry and subsurface

   in southern New York State. Acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), the sum of
   base cation concentrations (SBC), pH and concentrations of total

   measured during low stream flow at the outlets of nested basins ranging
   in size from 0.2 to 166.3 km(2). ANC, SBC, pH, Al and DOC showed
   pronounced changes as basin size increased from 0.2 to 3 km(2), but
   relatively small variations were observed as basin size increased beyond
   3 km(2). An index of subsurface contact time computed from basin
   topography and soil hydraulic conductivity also showed pronounced
   changes as basin size increased from 0.2 to 3 km(2) and smaller changes
   as basin size increased beyond 3 km(2). These results suggest that basin

   an attempt to modify the topographic index approach to reflect the
   expansion of the effective area of subsurface flow during the wetting-up

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a variable bucket capacity (VBC) representation
   of TOPMODEL (Beven and Kirkby, 1979), generalizing the Manabe `simple
   bucket' scheme widely used in climate models. In doing this, we have
   been motivated by the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model
   presented by Wood et al. (1992). For catchments, or for parts of the
   land surface, whose hydrology fits the TOPMODEL assumptions, this lumped
   version offers an alternative representation that can be used as the
   building block for land surface hydrology models at large spatial
   scales. The model is first applied, with satisfactory results, to a
   small catchment near Canberra in Australia. Next, using the same model,
   the effects of random spatial variability of rainfall are studied, but
   in the context of land surface hydrological parameterizations for global
   climate models. Sub-grid rainfall variability, especially the partial
   coverage that characterizes rainfall events at such large scales, is
   found to cause significant biases in the estimation of land surface
   fluxes. Other manifestations of the effects of the spatial variability
   of rainfall are also investigated, also by means of model simulations,
   but with a view to gaining insights for developing simple
   parameterizations of land surface fluxes at large scales. This includes
   the investigation of the dynamics, i.e. spatial and temporal
   variability, of the soil moisture state variable during and after a
   rainfall event. In addition, empirical relationships linking the
   variable contributing area, subsurface runoff and evaporation, to a soil
   moisture state variable (e.g. soil moisture storage), are derived based
   on model simulations, and the effects of the sub-grid rainfall
   variability on these relationships are examined. Because of the strong
   non-linearity inherent in the process descriptions within the model, the
   above `constitutive' relationships are strongly affected by rainfall
   heterogeneity. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The recent widespread availability of digital terrain data has resulted
   in increasing use, in a variety of hydrological models, of different
   degrees of complexity. Previous experience suggests that neither model
   results nor effective parameter values are independent of the resolution
   of the digital terrain data used. Calibration of parameter values can
   compensate for lack of resolution in the digital terrain data. This
   paper will show, for one particular model, TOPMODEL, how an analytical
   link can be established between the grid size of a raster digital
   terrain model and the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity value
   used in the model. The work generalizes the results of the recent study
   by Franchini et al. (1996) and allows the change in effective
   conductivity to be estimated on the basis of keeping a realistic
   simulation of saturated contributing areas as the DTM grid size changes.

Abstract = {{The region studied includes the Laurentian Great Lakes and a diversity
   of smaller glacial lakes, streams and wetlands south of permanent
   permafrost and towards the southern extent of Wisconsin glaciation. We
   emphasize lakes and quantitative implications. The region is warmer and
   wetter than it has been over most of the last 12000 years. Since 1911
   observed air temperatures have increased by about 0.11 degrees C per
   decade in spring and 0.06 degrees C in winter; annual precipitation has
   increased by about 2.1\% per decade. Ice thaw phenologies since the
   1850s indicate a late winter warming of about 2.5 degrees C. In future
   scenarios for a doubled CO2 climate, air temperature increases in summer
   and winter and precipitation decreases (summer) in western Ontario but
   increases (winter) in western Ontario, northern Minnesota, Wisconsin and
   Michigan. Such changes in climate have altered and would further alter
   hydrological and other physical features of lakes. Warmer climates, i.e.
   2 x CO2 climates, would lower net basin water supplies, stream flows and
   water levels owing to increased evaporation in excess of precipitation.
   Water levels have been responsive to drought and future scenarios for
   the Great Lakes simulate levels 0.2 to 2.5 m lower. Human adaptation to
   such changes is expensive. Warmer climates would decrease the spatial
   extent of ice cover on the Great Lakes; small lakes, especially to the
   south, would no longer freeze over every year. Temperature simulations
   for stratified lakes are 1-7 degrees C warmer for surface waters, and 6
   degrees C cooler to 8 degrees C warmer for deep waters. Thermocline
   depth would change (4 m shallower to 3.5 m deeper) with warmer climates
   alone; deepening owing to increases in light penetration would occur
   with reduced input of dissolved organic carbon (DOG) from dryer
   catchments. Dissolved oxygen would decrease below the thermocline. These
   physical changes would in turn affect the phytoplankton, zooplankton,
   benthos and fishes. Annual phytoplankton production may increase but
   many complex reactions of the phytoplankton community to altered
   temperatures, thermocline depths, light penetrations and nutrient inputs
   would be expected. Zooplankton biomass would increase, but, again, many
   complex interactions are expected.
   Generally, the thermal habitat for warm-, cool- and even cold-water
   fishes would increase in size in deep stratified lakes, but would
   decrease in shallow unstratified lakes and in streams. Less dissolved
   oxygen below the thermocline of lakes would further degrade stratified
   lakes for cold water fishes. Growth and production would increase for
   fishes that are now in thermal environments cooler than their optimum
   but decrease for those that are at or above their optimum, provided they
   cannot move to a deeper or headwater thermal refuge. The zoogeographical
   boundary for fish species could move north by 500-600 km; invasions of
   warmer water fishes and extirpations of colder water fishes should
   increase. Aquatic ecosystems across the region do not necessarily
   exhibit coherent responses to climate changes and variability, even if
   they are in close proximity. Lakes, wetlands and streams respond
   differently, as do fakes of different depth or productivity. Differences
   in hydrology and the position in the hydrological flow system, in
   terrestrial vegetation and land use, in base climates and in the aquatic
   biota can all cause different responses. Climate change effects interact
   strongly with effects of other human-caused stresses such as
   eutrophication, acid precipitation, toxic chemicals and the spread of
   exotic organisms. Aquatic ecological systems in the region are sensitive
   to climate change and variation.
   Assessments of these potential effects are in an early stage and contain
   many uncertainties in the models and properties of aquatic ecological
   systems and of the climate system. (C) 1997 by John Wiley B Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Region 2 comprises arctic and subarctic North America and is underlain
   by continuous or discontinuous permafrost. Its freshwater systems are
   dominated by a low energy environment and cold region processes. Central
   northern areas are almost totally influenced by arctic air masses while
   Pacific air becomes more prominent in the west, Atlantic air in the east
   and southern air masses at the lower latitudes. Air mass changes will
   play an important role in precipitation changes associated with climate
   warming. The snow season in the region is prolonged resulting in
   long-term storage of water so that the spring flood is often the major
   hydrological event of the year, even though, annual rainfall usually
   exceeds annual snowfall. The unique character of ponds and lakes is a
   result of the long frozen period, which affects nutrient status and gas
   exchange during the cold season and during thaw. GCM models are in close
   agreement for this region and predict temperature increases as large as
   4 degrees C in summer and 9 degrees C in winter for a 2 x CO? scenario.
   Palaeoclimate indicators support the probability that substantial
   temperature increases have occurred previously during the Holocene. The
   historical record indicates a temperature increase of >1 degrees C in
   parts of the region during the last century. GCM predictions of
   precipitation change indicate an increase, but there is little agreement
   amongst the various models on regional disposition or magnitude.
   Precipitation change is as important as temperature change in
   determining the water balance. The water balance is critical to every
   aspect of hydrology and limnology in the far north. Permafrost close to
   the surface plays a major role in freshwater systems because it often
   maintains lakes and wetlands above an impermeable frost table, which
   limits the water storage capabilities of the subsurface. Thawing
   associated with climate change would, particularly in areas of massive
   ice, stimulate landscape changes, which can affect every aspect of the
   environment. The normal spring flooding of ice-jammed north-flowing
   rivers, such as the Mackenzie, is a major event, which renews the water
   supply of lakes in delta regions and which determines the availability
   of habitat for aquatic organisms. Climate warming or river damming and
   diversion would probably lead to the complete drying of many delta
   lakes. Climate warning would also change the characteristics of ponds
   that presently freeze to the bottom and result in fundamental changes in
   their limnological characteristics. At present, the food chain is rather
   simple usually culminating in lake trout or arctic char. A lengthening
   of the growing season and warmer water temperature would affect the
   chemical, mineral and nutrient status of lakes and most likely have
   deleterious effects on the food chain. Peatlands are extensive in region
   2. They would move northwards at their southern boundaries, and, with
   sustained drying, many would change form or become inactive, Extensive
   wetlands and peatlands are an important component of the global carbon
   budget, and warmer and drier conditions would most likely change them
   from a sink to a source for atmospheric carbon. There is some evidence
   that this may be occurring already. Region 2 is very vulnerable to
   global warming. Its freshwater systems are probably the least studied
   and most poorly understood in North America.
   There are clear needs to improve our current knowledge of temperature
   and precipitation patterns; to model the thermal behaviour of wetlands,
   lakes and rivers; to understand better the interrelationships of cold
   region rivers with their basins; to begin studies on the very large
   lakes in the region; to obtain a firm grasp of the role of northern
   peatlands in the global carbon cycle; and to link the terrestrial water
   balance to the thermal and hydrological regime of the polar sea. Overall
   there is a strong need for basic research and long-term monitoring. (C)

Abstract = {{The Rocky Mountains in the USA and Canada encompass the interior
   cordillera of western North America, from the southern Yukon to northern
   New Mexico. Annual weather patterns are cold in winter and mild in
   summer. Precipitation has high seasonal and interannual variation and
   may differ by an order of magnitude between geographically close
   locales, depending on slope, aspect and local climatic and orographic
   conditions. The region's hydrology is characterized by the accumulation
   of winter snow, spring snowmelt and autumnal baseflows. During the
   2-3-month `spring runoff period, rivers frequently discharge > 70\% of
   their annual water budget and have instantaneous discharges 10-100 times
   mean low flow.
   Complex weather patterns characterized by high spatial and temporal
   variability make predictions of future conditions tenuous. However,
   general patterns are identifiable; northern and western portions of the
   region are dominated by maritime weather patterns from the North
   Pacific, central areas and eastern slopes are dominated by continental
   air masses and southern portions receive seasonally variable atmospheric
   circulation from the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. Significant
   interannual variations occur in these general patterns, possibly related
   to ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) forcing.
   Changes in precipitation and temperature regimes or patterns have
   significant potential effects on the distribution and abundance of
   plants and animals. For example, elevation of the timber-line is
   principally a function of temperature. Palaeolimnological investigations
   have shown significant shifts in phyto- and zoo-plankton populations as
   alpine lakes shift between being above or below the timber-line.
   Likewise, streamside vegetation has a significant effect on stream
   ecosystem structure and function. Changes in stream temperature regimes
   result in significant changes in community composition as a consequence
   of bioenergetic factors. Stenothermic species could be extirpated as
   appropriate thermal criteria disappear. Warming temperatures may
   geographically isolate cole water stream fishes in increasingly confined
   headwaters. The heat budgets of large lakes may be affected resulting in
   a change of state between dimictic and warm monomictic character.
   Uncertainties associated with prediction are increased by the planting
   of fish in historically fishless, high mountain lakes and the
   introduction of non-native species of fishes and invertebrates into
   often previously simple food-webs of large valley bottom lakes and
   streams. Many of the streams and rivers suffer from the anthropogenic
   effects of abstraction and regulation. Likewise, many of the large lakes
   receive nutrient loads from a growing human population.
   We concluded that: (1) regional climate models are required to resolve
   adequately the complexities of the high gradient landscapes; (2)
   extensive wilderness preserves and national park lands, so prevalent in
   the Rocky Mountain Region, provide sensitive areas for differentiation
   of anthropogenic effects from climate effects; and (3) future research
   should encompass both short-term intensive studies and long-term
   monitoring studies developed within comprehensive experimental arrays of
   streams and lakes specifically designed to address the issue of
   anthropogenic versus climatic effects. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Numerous freshwater ecosystems, dense concentrations of humans along the
   eastern seaboard, extensive forests and a history of intensive land use
   distinguish the New England/Mid-Atlantic Region. Human population
   densities are forecast to increase in portions of the region at the same
   time that climate is expected to be changing. Consequently, the effects
   of humans and climatic change are likely to affect freshwater ecosystems
   within the region interactively. The general climate, at present, is
   humid continental, and the region receives abundant precipitation.
   Climatic projections for a 2 x CO2 atmosphere, however, suggest warmer
   and drier conditions for much of this region. Annual temperature
   increases ranging from 3-5 degrees C are projected, with the greatest
   increases occurring in autumn or winter. According to a water balance
   model, the projected increase in temperature will result in greater
   rates of evaporation and evapotranspiration. This could cause a 21 and
   31\% reduction in annual stream flow in the southern and northern
   sections of the region, respectively, with greatest reductions occurring
   in autumn and winter. The amount and duration of snow cover is also
   projected to decrease across the region, and summer convective
   thunderstorms are likely to decrease in frequency but increase in
   intensity.
   The dual effects of climate change and direct anthropogenic stress will
   most likely alter hydrological and biogeochemical processes, and, hence,
   the floral and faunal communities of the region's freshwater ecosystems.
   For example, the projected increase in evapotranspiration and
   evaporation could eliminate most bog ecosystems, and increases in water
   temperature may increase bioaccumulation, and possibly biomagnification,
   of organic and inorganic contaminants. Not all change may be adverse.
   For example, a decrease in runoff may reduce the intensity of ongoing
   estuarine eutrophication, and acidification of aquatic habitats during
   the spring snowmelt period may be ameliorated.
   Recommendations for future monitoring efforts include: (1) extending and
   improving data on the distribution, abundance and effect of
   anthropogenic stressors (non-point pollution) within the region; and (2)
   improving scientific knowledge regarding the contemporary distribution
   and abundance of aquatic species. Research recommendations include: (1)
   establishing a research centre(s) where field studies designed to
   understand interactions between freshwater ecosystems and climate change
   can be conducted; (2) projecting the future distribution, activities and
   direct effects of humans within the region; (3) developing mathematical
   analyses, experimental designs and aquatic indicators that distinguish
   between climatic and anthropogenic effects on aquatic systems; (4)
   developing and refining projections of climate variability such that the
   magnitude, frequency and seasonal timing of extreme events can be
   forecast; and (5) describing quantitatively the flux of materials
   (sediments, nutrients, metals) from watersheds characterized by a mosaic
   of land uses. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The south-eastern United States and Gulf Coast of Mexico is
   physiographically diverse, although dominated by a broad coastal plain.
   Much of the region has a humid, warm temperate climate with little
   seasonality in precipitation but strong seasonality in runoff owing to
   high rates of summer evapotranspiration. The climate of southern Florida
   and eastern Mexico is subtropical with a distinct summer wet season and
   winter dry season. Regional climate models suggest that climate change
   resulting from a doubling of the pre-industrial levels of atmospheric
   CO2 may increase annual air temperatures by 3-4 degrees C. Changes in
   precipitation are highly uncertain, but the most probable scenario shows
   higher levels over all but the northern, interior portions of the
   region, with increases primarily occurring in summer and occurring as
   more intense or clustered storms. Despite the increases in
   precipitation, runoff is likely to decline over much of the region owing
   to increases in evapotranspiration exceeding increases in precipitation.
   Only in Florida and the Gulf Coast areas of the US and Mexico are
   precipitation increases likely to exceed evapotranspiration increases,
   producing an increase in runoff. However, increases in storm intensity
   and clustering are likely to result in more extreme hydrographs, with
   larger peaks in flow but lower baseflows and longer periods of drought.
   The ecological effects of climate change on freshwaters of the region
   include: (1) a general increase in rates of primary production, organic
   matter decomposition and nutrient cycling as a result of higher
   temperatures and longer growing seasons: (2) reduction in habitat for
   cool water species, particularly fish and macroinvertebrates in
   Appalachian streams; (3) reduction in water quality and in suitable
   habitat in summer owing to lower baseflows and intensification of the
   temperature-dissolved oxygen squeeze in many rivers and reservoirs; (4)
   reduction in organic matter storage and loss of organisms during more
   intense flushing events in some streams and wetlands; (5) shorter
   periods of inundation of riparian wetlands and greater drying of wetland
   soils, particularly in northern and inland areas; (6) expansion of
   subtropical species northwards, including several non-native nuisance
   species currently confined to southern Florida; (7) expansion of
   wetlands in Florida and coastal Mexico, but increase in eutrophication
   of Florida lakes as a result of greater runoff from urban and
   agricultural areas; and (8) changes in the flushing rate of estuaries
   that would alter their salinity regimes, stratification and water
   quality as well as influence productivity in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Many of the expected climate change effects will exacerbate current
   anthropogenic stresses on the region's freshwater systems, including
   increasing demands for water, increasing waste heat loadings and land
   use changes that alter the quantity and quality of runoff to streams and
   reservoirs. Research is needed especially in several critical areas:
   long-term monitoring of key hydrological, chemical and biological
   properties (particularly water balances in small, forested catchments
   and temperature-sensitive species); experimental studies of the effects
   of warming on organisms and ecosystem processes under realistic
   conditions (e.g. in situ heating experiments): studies of the effects of
   natural hydrological variation on biological communities; and assessment
   of the effects of water management activities on organisms and ecosystem
   processes, including development and testing of management and
   restoration strategies designed to counteract changes in climate. (C)

Abstract = {{The region designated as the Pacific Coastal Mountains and Western Great
   Basin extends from southern Alaska (64 degrees N) to southern California
   (34 degrees N) and ranges in altitude from sea level to 6200 m.
   Orographic effects combine with moisture-laden frontal systems
   originating in the Pacific Ocean to produce areas of very high
   precipitation on western slopes and dry basins of internal drainage on
   eastern hanks of the mountains. In the southern half of the region most
   of the runoff occurs during winter or spring, while in the northern part
   most occurs in summer, especially in glaciated basins, Analyses of
   long-term climatic and hydrological records, combined with
   palaeoclimatic reconstructions and simulations of future climates, are
   used as the basis for likely scenarios of climatic variations. The
   predicted hydrological response in northern California to a climate with
   doubled CO2 and higher temperatures is a decrease in the amount of
   precipitation falling as snow, and substantially increased runoff during
   winter and less in late spring and summer. One consequence of the
   predicted earlier runoff is higher salinity in summer and autumn in San
   Francisco Bay. In saline lakes, the incidence of meromixis and the
   associated reduction in nutrient supply and algal abundance is expected
   to vary significantly as runoff fluctuates. In subalpine lakes, global
   warming will probably will lead to increased productivity. Lacustrine
   productivity can also be altered by changes in wind regimes,
   drought-enhanced forest fires and maximal or minimal snowpacks
   associated with atmospheric anomalies such as Fl Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO) events. Reduced stream temperature from increased
   contributions of glacial meltwater and decreased channel stability from
   changed runoff patterns and altered sediment loads has the potential to
   reduce the diversity of zoobenthic communities in predominately
   glacier-fed rivers. Climatic warming is likely to result in reduced
   growth and survival of sockeye salmon in freshwater, which would, in
   turn, increase marine mortality. Further research activities should
   include expanded studies at high elevations and of glacier mass balances
   and glacial runoff, applications of remote sensing to monitor changes,
   further refinement of regional climatic models to improve forecasts of
   future conditions and continued analyses of long-term physical, chemical
   and biological data to help understand responses to future climates. (C)

Abstract = {{The Great Plains landscape is less topographically complex than most
   other regions within North America, but diverse aquatic ecosystems, such
   as playas, pothole lakes, ox-bow lakes, springs, groundwater aquifers,
   intermittent and ephemeral streams, as well as large rivers and
   wetlands, are highly dynamic and responsive to extreme climatic
   fluctuations. We review the evidence for climatic change that
   demonstrates the historical importance of extremes in north-south
   differences in summer temperatures and east-west differences in aridity
   across four large subregions. These physical driving forces alter
   density stratification, deoxygenation, decomposition and salinity.
   Biotic community composition and associated ecosystem processes of
   productivity and nutrient cycling respond rapidly to these climatically
   driven dynamics. Ecosystem processes also respond to cultural effects
   such as dams and diversions of water for irrigation, waste dilution and
   urban demands for drinking water and industrial uses. Distinguishing
   climatic from cultural effects in future models of aquatic ecosystem
   functioning will require more refinement in both climatic and economic
   forecasting. There is a need, for example, to predict how long-term
   climatic forecasts (based on both ENSO and global warming simulations)
   relate to the permanence and productivity of shallow water ecosystems.
   Aquatic ecologists, hydrologists, climatologists and geographers have
   much to discuss regarding the synthesis of available data and the design
   of future interdisciplinary research. (C) 1997 by John Wiley gi Sons,

Abstract = {{Variability and unpredictability are characteristics of the aquatic
   ecosystems, hydrological patterns and climate of the largely dryland
   region that encompasses the Basin and Range, American Southwest and
   western Mexico. Neither hydrological nor climatological models for the
   region are sufficiently developed to describe the magnitude or direction
   of change in response to increased carbon dioxide; thus, an attempt to
   predict specific responses of aquatic ecosystems is premature. Instead,
   we focus on the sensitivity of rivers, streams, springs, wetlands,
   reservoirs, and lakes of the region to potential changes in climate,
   especially those inducing a change in hydrological patterns such as
   amount, timing and predictability of stream flow.
   The major sensitivities of aquatic ecosystems are their permanence and
   even existence in the face of potential reduced net basin supply of
   water, stability of geomorphological structure and riparian ecotones
   with alterations in disturbance regimes, and water quality changes
   resulting from a modified water balance. In all of these respects,
   aquatic ecosystems of the region are also sensitive to the extensive
   modifications imposed by human use of water resources, which underscores
   the difficulty of separating this type of anthropogenic change from
   climate change. We advocate a focus in future research on reconstruction
   and analysis of past climates and associated ecosystem characteristics,
   long-term studies to discriminate directional change vs. year to year
   variability (including evidence of aquatic ecosystem responses or
   sensitivity to extremes), and studies of ecosystems affected by human
   activity. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwaters in different regions show many similarities and differences
   in their responses to climatic warming. Bases for comparison include
   reports from regional committees, long-term records for several sites
   where climate has warmed in the past two decades and other human
   alterations to freshwaters that simulate some of the expected results of
   climatic warming, such as reservoir construction. Palaeoecological
   studies of freshwaters under climatic warming and differences in
   communities under different climatic regimes are also considered. Major
   changes in the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of
   lakes occur. Many of the changes to lakes and streams are the result of
   strong effects of climatic warming on terrestrial catchments. Inputs
   from catchments can be either dampened or amplified by in-lake
   processes, in some cases causing counter-intuitive responses, such as
   the acidification of streams but alkalinization of lakes in areas where
   supplies of base cations are limited. Consideration of land-water
   interactions and interactions between climatic warming and other human
   stresses are important for the accurate prediction of the effects of
   climatic change. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Single collection stations for wet or bulk deposition are generally
   inadequate to describe atmospheric inputs to watersheds in complex
   terrain. Atmospheric deposition is delivered by wet, dry and cloud
   deposition processes, and these processes are controlled by a wide range
   of landscape features, including canopy type and structure, topographic
   exposure, elevation and slope orientation. As a result, there can be a
   very high degree of spatial variability within a watershed, and a single
   sampling point, especially at low elevation, is unlikely to be
   representative. Atmospheric inputs at the watershed scale can be
   calculated from the whole watershed mass balance if the outputs and
   within-watershed sources and sinks are known with sufficient accuracy.
   Alternatively, indices of atmospheric deposition such as Pb accumulation
   in the forest floor and SO42- flux in throughfall can be used to
   characterize patterns of total deposition, and these indices can be used
   to model deposition to the entire watershed based on known landscape
   features such as elevation and canopy type. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Six methods were compared for calculating annual stream exports of
   sulfate, nitrate, calcium, magnesium and aluminum from six small
   Appalachian watersheds. Approximately 250-400 stream samples and
   concurrent stream flow measurements were collected during baseflows and
   storm flows for the 1989 water year at five Pennsylvania watersheds and
   during the 1989-1992 water years at a West Virginia watershed.
   Continuous stream flow records were also collected at each watershed.
   Solute exports were calculated from the complete data set using six
   different scenarios ranging from instantaneous monthly measurements of
   stream chemistry and stream flow, to intensive monitoring of storm flow
   events and multiple regression equations. The results for five of the
   methods were compared with the regression method because statistically
   significant models were developed and the regression equations allowed
   for prediction of solute concentrations during unsampled storm hows.
   Results indicated that continuous stream flow measurement was critical
   to producing exports within 10\% of regression estimates. For solutes
   whose concentrations were not correlated strongly with stream flow,
   weekly grab samples combined with continuous records of stream flow were
   sufficient to produce export estimates within 10\% of the regression
   method. For solutes whose concentrations were correlated strongly with
   stream flow, more intensive sampling during storm hows or the use of
   multiple regression equations were the most appropriate methods,
   especially for watersheds where stream flows changed most quickly.
   Concentration-stream flow relationships, stream hydrological response,
   available resources and required level of accuracy of chemical budgets
   should be considered when choosing a method for calculating solute
   exports. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to test the utility of a geographical
   information systems (GIS) approach to problems of watershed mass
   balance. This approach proved most useful in exploring the effects that
   watershed scale, lithology and land use have on chemical weathering
   rates, and in assessing whether mass balance calculations could be
   applied to large multilithological watersheds. Water quality data from
   52 stations were retrieved from STORET and a complete GIS database
   consisting of the watershed divide, lithology and land use was compiled
   for each station. Water quality data were also obtained from 7
   experimental watersheds to develop a methodology to estimate annual
   fluxes from incomplete data sets. The methodology consists of preparing
   a composite of daily flux data, calculating a best fit sinusoid and
   integrating the equation to obtain an annual flux. Comparison with
   annual fluxes calculated from high resolution data sets suggests that
   this method predicts fluxes within about 10\% of the true annual flux.
   Annual magnesium fluxes (moles km(-2) yr(-1)) were calculated for all
   stations and adjusted for fluxes from atmospheric deposition. Magnesium
   flux was found to be a strong function of the amount of carbonate in the
   watershed, and silica fluxes were found to increase with the fraction of
   sandstone present in the watershed. All fluxes were strongly influenced
   by mining practices, with magnesium fluxes from affected watersheds
   being 6-10 times higher than fluxes from comparable pristine watersheds.
   Mining practices enhance chemical weathering by increasing the surface
   area of unweathered rock to which water has access and by increasing
   acidity and rate of mineral weathering. Fluxes were also found to
   increase with watershed size. This scale dependence is most likely
   caused by the sensitivity of weathering fluxes to even minor quantities
   of carbonates, which are likely to be found in all lithologies at larger
   scales.
   Mass balances were carried out in watersheds where gauged sub-watersheds
   made up more than 95\% of the area. The calculations show large
   magnesium flux and water balance discrepancies. These errors may be a
   result of significant groundwater inputs to streams between gauges. The
   results suggest that improvements in how we measure discharge and
   estimate fluxes may be required before we can apply mass balance
   techniques to larger scales. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The simulation of weathering, solute distribution or acidification at
   the catchment scale is predominantly done with either a mass balance or
   process level model. The former redistributes total elemental
   concentrations between known points with measured total concentration,
   but does not explicitly include catchment hydrology. The latter includes
   compartmental hydrological models and detailed descriptions of spatially
   averaged chemical reactions. Interestingly, the model applications tend
   towards hydrologically different watershed structures: mass balance
   modelling favours bare rock watersheds similar to the Apache Leap
   Research Site, whereas process level models are applied most often to
   forested watersheds, among which the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest
   is an example. Although constrained either by mineral or water
   compositions on the one hand, or calibrated against stream or lake water
   chemistry on the other, both approaches basically fit parameters to the
   geochemical circumstances of the specific watershed of interest. Limited
   success is attained if the hydrological conditions remain within the
   circumstances of the parameter fitting. The principal differences in
   model formulation and approach to mass balance modelling are discussed.
   Without advancements in model calibration and rigorous model testing,
   and the development of methods for optimizing the important reactions
   and pathways, the transportability of models between watersheds or the
   simulation of extreme events will continue to be inadequate. (C) 1997 by

Abstract = {{The importance of mineral weathering was assessed and compared for five
   mid-Atlantic watersheds receiving similar atmospheric inputs but
   underlain by differing bedrock. Annual solute mass balances and
   volume-weighted mean solute concentrations were calculated for each
   watershed for each year of record. In addition, primary and secondary
   mineralogy were determined for each of the watersheds through analysis
   of soil samples and thin sections using petrographic, scanning electron
   microscope, electron microprobe and X-ray diffraction techniques.
   Mineralogical data were also compiled from the literature. These data
   were input to NETPATH, a geochemical program that calculates the masses
   of minerals that react with precipitation to produce stream water
   chemistry. The feasibilities of the weathering scenarios calculated by
   NETPATH were evaluated based on relative abundances and reactivities of
   minerals in the watershed. In watersheds underlain by reactive bedrocks,
   weathering reactions explained the stream base cation loading. In the
   acid-sensitive watersheds on unreactive bedrock, calculated weathering
   scenarios were not consistent with the abundance of reactive minerals in
   the underlying bedrock, and alternative sources of base cations are
   discussed. (C) 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The use of mass balances in the investigation of the biogeochemical
   cycle of sulfur is reviewed for three systems: 1) upland catchments, 2)
   wetlands, and 3) lakes. In upland catchments, the major inputs of sulfur
   are via wet and dry atmospheric deposition, whereas outputs or losses
   occur primarily through volatilization and/or runoff. In addition,
   sulfur may be stored in vegetation and in the forest floor. In wetlands
   (particularly peatlands), a large proportion of the sulfur inputs are
   derived from surface and groundwater originating:in the upland system.
   Because of the fluctuating water table in wetlands, they can act as a
   source or sink for sulfate, depending on the redox conditions. Wetlands,
   therefore, can significantly affect input-output budgets for lakes. In
   most lakes, only a small portion of the sulfate input is retained, (i.e.
   not lost from the lake via outflow), indicating that there is an excess
   of sulfate relative to biological needs. Seepage lakes are exceptions to
   this generalization. Although the reactivity of the sulfate input to
   many lakes is low, sulfate levels, especially in regions receiving
   substantial atmospheric sulfur deposition, are high enough that the
   portion reduced results in substantial in-lake alkalinity production; in
   fact, in many cases, alkalinity production from sulfate reduction is
   greater than that resulting from not only other in-lake processes but
   from external sources (the catchment) as well.
   The importance of mass balance investigations in elucidating the
   biogeochemical cycling of sulfur is stressed and the need for additional
   studies on a whole-system basis stressed. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Measured, calculated and simulated values were combined to develop an
   annual nitrogen budget for Loch Vale Watershed (LVWS) in the Colorado
   Front Range. Nine-year average wet nitrogen deposition values were 1.6
   (s = 0.36) kg NO3-N ha(-1), and 1.0 (s = 0.3) kg NH4-N ha(-1). Assuming
   dry nitrogen deposition to be half that of measured wet deposition, this
   high elevation watershed receives 3.9 kg N ha(-1). Although deposition
   values fluctuated with precipitation, measured stream nitrogen outputs
   were less variable. Of the total N input to the watershed (3.9 kg N
   ha(-1) wet plus dry deposition), 49\% of the total N input was
   immobilized. Stream losses were 2.0 kg N ha(-1) (1125 kg measured
   dissolved inorganic N in 1992, 1-2 kg calculated dissolved organic N,
   plus an average of 203 kg algal N from the entire 660 ha watershed).
   Tundra and aquatic algae were the largest reservoirs for incoming N, at
   approximately 18\% and 15\% of the total 2574 kg N deposition,
   respectively. Rocky areas and forest stored the remaining 11\% and 5\%,
   respectively. Fully 80\% of N losses from the watershed came from the
   68\% of LVWS that is alpine. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Sulfur and nitrogen input-output budgets were estimated for five
   forested Appalachian Plateau basins in Pennsylvania for the period
   October 1988 to March 1990. Wet and dry deposition inputs were
   determined on a weekly basis from data collected at atmospheric
   deposition monitoring stations located near the study sites. Stream
   export was estimated from intensively sampled stream chemistry and
   continuous discharge data collected on all five basins. On four of the
   five basins, deposited sulfur was essentially in balance with stream
   flow export of sulfur (92-120\% exported) for the 1989 water year. The
   fifth basin had net retention of deposited sulfur, with only 42\%
   exported. All five basins retained the vast majority of deposited
   nitrogen(only 3-18\% exported). The fraction of atmospherically
   deposited sulfur exported in stream flow was greater by a mean factor of
   14 versus nitrogen, implying that sulfur dominates base cation leaching
   processes on these non-carbonate-based catchments; Although basins in
   the study were relatively homogeneous in terms of topography, climate,
   geology and land use, local basin conditions caused significant
   differences in input-output budgets, pointing to the need for replicated
   basin studies in a region. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A wildfire in an afforested research catchment presented the rare
   opportunity to compare the hydrological effects of wildfire with the
   effects of clearfelling in the same catchment in the Jonkershoek Valley,
   in the south-western Western Cape Province of South Africa. The timber
   plantation, which occupies 57\% of the 2 km(2) catchment, had been
   clearfelled and re-planted to Pinus radiata roughly five years before
   the fire. The effects of the two treatments on total flow, stormflow and
   quick-flow volumes, peak discharge and storm response ratio were
   determined by means of multiple regression analysis, employing the dummy
   variable method to test for the significance of treatments. Both
   clearfelling and wildfire caused significant increases in all the
   stream-flow variables analysed. But the clearfelling effect was
   dominated by large increases in total flow (96\% over three years), of
   which storm-flow and quick-flow volumes formed only minor parts. After
   the wildfire, by contrast, increases in total flow were small (12\%) but
   the storm flow increases were three- to fourfold in the first year and
   roughly double in the second year. The wildfire caused fire-induced
   water repellency in the soils which led to overland flow on mid-slope
   sites, where soil infiltrability normally far exceeds local rainfall
   intensities. It is argued that these results support the hypothesis that
   stream-flow generation processes were changed by the wildfire in that
   overland flow made a direct contribution to storm flows, but that
   clearfelling had no such effect. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous monitoring of conservative and non-conservative tracers in
   streamflow offers a valuable means of obtaining information on the age
   and flow paths of water reaching the basin outlet. Previous studies of
   stormflow generation in a small forested basin on the Canadian Shield
   used isotopic (IHS) and geochemical hydrograph separations (GHS) to
   infer that some event water during snowmelt reaches the stream via
   subsurface pathways, and that surface water runoff is generated by
   direct precipitation on to saturated areas (DPSA) in the stream valley.
   These hypotheses were tested for rainfall inputs using simultaneous IHS
   (O-18) and GHS (dissolved silica) of basin stormflow, supplemented by
   hydrochemical and hydrometric data from throughflow troughs installed on
   basin slopes. Comparison of pre-event and subsurface water hydrographs
   did not provide conclusive evidence for subsurface movement of event
   water to the stream, owing to the appreciable uncertainty associated
   with the hydrograph separations. However, IHSs of runoff at the
   soil-bedrock interface on basin slopes indicated that event water
   comprised 25-50\% of total runoff from areas with deep soil cover, and
   that these contributions supplied event water flux from the basin in
   excess of that attributable to DPSA. The surface water component of
   stormflow estimated from the GHS was also largely the result of DPSA.
   GHS assumes that dissolved silica is rapidly and uniformly taken up by
   water infiltrating the soil and that water moving via surface pathways
   retains the low dissolved silica level of rainfall; however, neither
   assumption was supported by the hillslope results. Instead, results
   suggest that the observed depression of silica levels in basin stormflow
   previously attributed to dilution by DPSA was partly a function of
   transport of dilute event water to the channel via preferential
   pathways. Implications of these results for the general use of
   simultaneous IHS and GHS to infer hydrological processes are discussed.

Abstract = {{Evidence for the functioning of macropores and the presence of
   preferential flow in forest soils is equivocal. This is partly because
   many workers use only one diagnostic technique to indicate whether or
   not macropore flow occurs. In this paper three lines of evidence are
   used to suggest that preferential flow does not occur in the percolating
   waters of a coniferous forest soil under the range of hydrological
   conditions that prevail in the field. To simulate field conditions,
   realistic rainfall intensities were used in conservative solute
   transport experiments on four undisturbed soil columns.
   A method is described in which breakthrough data can be used to
   calculate the percentage of antecedent water displaced from a soil
   column during frontal-type breakthrough experiments. Calculations based
   on this method using the experimental data show that as little as five
   percent of the antecedent water was immobile, The simple form of the
   functional advection-dispersion equation, based on a single value for
   linear velocity and the dispersion coefficient was fitted to two of the
   breakthrough curves with reasonable accuracy, further suggesting that
   preferential flow did not occur in the experiments. Finally, soil
   moisture characteristic curves were determined for replicate soil
   samples from the forest soil. The operational water contents of the
   columns during the breakthrough experiments were compared with the soil
   moisture characteristics and it was found that pores exerting pressure
   heads greater than -0.5 kPa did not appear to contribute to flow through
   the columns, again suggesting an absence of preferential flow. (C) 1997

Abstract = {{Since the development of the entropy theory by Shannon in the late 1940s
   and of the principle of maximum entropy (POME) by Jaynes in the late
   1950s there has been a proliferation of applications of entropy in a
   wide spectrum of areas, including hydrological and environmental
   sciences. The real impetus to entropy-based hydrological modelling was
   provided by Amorocho and Espildora in 1972. A great variety of entropy
   applications in hydrology and water resources have since been reported,
   and new applications continue to unfold. This paper reviews the recent
   contributions on entropy applications in hydrology and water resources,
   discusses the usefulness and versatility of the entropy concept, and
   reflects on the strengths and limitations of this concept. The paper
   concludes with comments on its implications in developing countries. (C)

Abstract = {{Reliable quantification of suspended sediment (SS) and particulate
   phosphorus (PP) transport, and identification of the various delivery
   pathways at the catchment level, is an important and necessary aid to
   appropriate catchment management. In this study we measured storm event,
   seasonal and annual losses of SS and PP from a Danish arable catchment,
   Gelbaek Stream, using a multisampling strategy. SS losses for the study
   years May 1993-April 1994 and May 1994-April 1995 ranged from 71 to 88
   kg ha(-1), while PP losses ranged from 0.32 to 0.36 kg P ha(-1). In both
   cases losses mainly occurred during infrequent storm events. In
   comparison with intensive storm sampling, infrequent (fortnightly)
   sampling underestimated annual transport during the two study years by
   -24 and -331\%, respectively, for SS, and by -86 and -151\%,
   respectively, for PP. Reliable estimation of the transport of sediment
   and sediment-associated nutrients and other substances thus necessitates
   the use of an intensive monitoring approach. Turbidimeters proved to be
   a good substitute for direct measurement of SS, especially during storm
   events, although careful calibration is needed at the seasonal and storm
   event levels.
   Experience shows that in artificially drained and geologically complex
   catchments such as Gelbaek, simultaneous comparative monitoring of
   different sources (e.g. subsurface drainage water) is an important means
   of reliably discriminating between the various diffuse sources of
   sediment and phosphorus. Subsurface drainage water was found to account
   for 11-15\% of the annual SS export from the catchment; the
   corresponding figure for PP being 11-18\%. Surface runoff was only a
   source of SS and PP during the first study year, when it accounted for
   19\% of SS and 7\% of PP catchment export. Stream bank/bed erosion must
   therefore have been the major diffuse source of SS and PP in both study
   years. The study also revealed that analysis of the trace element
   content (e.g. Cs-137, (210)pb) of the SS transported in subsurface
   drainage water and stream water during storm events is a useful means of
   discriminating between diffuse losses of SS delivered from topsoil and
   subsoil compartments. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, several attempts have been made to relate the hydrological
   response of a catchment to its morphological and topographical features
   using different hypotheses to model the effect of the drainage network.
   Several transfer functions were developed and some of these are based on
   the theory of a linear model, the geomorphological unit hydrograph. The
   aim of this paper is to present a methodology to automatically identify
   the transfer function, using digital elevation models for applications
   in distributed hydrological modelling. The transfer function proposed
   herein is based on the Hayami approximation solution of the diffusive
   wave equation especially adapted for the routing hydrograph through a
   channel network. The Garden d'Anduze basin, southern France, was
   retained for applications. Digital elevation models were used to extract
   the channel network and divide the basin into subcatchments. Each
   subcatchment produces, at its own outlet, an impulse response which is
   routed to the outlet of the whole catchment using the diffusive wave
   model described by two parameters: celerity and diffusivity functions of
   geometrical characteristics of the channel network. Firstly, a
   geomorphological unit hydrograph obtained by routing a homogeneous
   effective rainfall was compared with the unit hydrograph identified by a
   lumped model scheme, then the distributed model was applied to take into
   account the spatial variability of effective rainfall in the catchment.
   Results show that this new method seems to be adapted for distributed
   hydrological modelling; it enables identification of a transfer function
   response for each hydrological unit, here subcatchments, and then
   simulation of the contribution of each unit to the hydrograph at the
   outlet. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Four high mountain glacial basins of the northern and southern periphery
   of central Asia were studied to determine their interaction with the
   external hydrological cycle over the Eurasian continent. Two of them
   located in the northern periphery are closed drainage basins with
   continental climate and the other two are open basins located in the
   southern periphery. Calculations of mass energy exchange, glacial runoff
   and components of the hydrological cycles were conducted. For glaciers
   with a continental climate, the calculations of snow-ice melt and runoff
   were based on solar parameters. For glaciers with a marine climate
   regime, glacier melt and runoff were based on air temperature. The
   relative errors of simulated annual flows were, on average, 8-14\%. The
   components of the regional hydrological cycles (precipitation,
   condensation, runoff and evaporation) were quantified for each glacial
   system and their share in total atmospheric moisture was determined. The
   closed basins of the northern periphery in central Asia stored annually
   about 0.1-2.4\% of the total external atmospheric moisture in the
   Aralo-Caspian and Tarim hydrographic systems. About 0.22-0.24\% of the
   external water cycle is transferred annually in open glacial basins of
   the southern periphery. The glaciers of these regions return 0.25-0.30\%
   of the external water cycle per year to the Pacific and Indian oceans,
   0.03\% and 0.06\% of this external moisture is taken from the glacial
   resources of the Gongga and Xixibangma glaciers. (C) 1997 by John Wiley

Abstract = {{In this paper, the feasibility of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   to study water infiltration into a heterogeneous soil is examined,
   together with its difficulties and limitations. MRI studies of ponded
   water infiltration into an undisturbed soil core show that the
   combination of one- and two-dimensional imaging techniques provides a
   visual and non-destructive means of monitoring the temporal changes of
   soil water content and the moisture profile, and the movement of the
   wetting front. Two-dimensional images show air entrapment in repetitive
   ponded infiltration experiments. During the early stages of filtration,
   one-dimensional images of soil moisture profiles clearly indicate
   preferential how phenomena. The observed advance of wetting fronts can
   be described by a linear relationship between the square root of
   infiltration time (root s) and the distance of the wetting front from
   the soil surface. Similarly, the cumulative infiltration is also
   directly proportional to root t. Furthermore, from the MRI infiltration
   moisture profiles, it is possible to estimate the parameters that
   feature in infiltration equations. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial and temporal distribution of sulphate (SO4) concentrations
   in peat pore water and the outlet streams of two forested swamps was
   related to variations in the magnitude of upland runoff, wetland water
   levels and flow path. The swamps were located in headwater catchments
   with contrasting till depths typical of the southern Canadian Shield.
   Inputs of SO4 from shallow hillslope tills and streams showed little
   seasonal variation in either source or concentration in both swamps.
   Sulphate dynamics at the outlet stream reflected hydrological and
   biogeochemical processes within the valley wetlands, which in turn were
   partly controlled by catchment hydrogeology. During high runoff, maximum
   water table elevations and peak surface flow in the swamps resulted in
   upland inputs largely bypassing anoxic peat. Consequently, SO4
   concentrations of 8-10 mg/l at the swamp outlets were similar to stream
   and groundwater inputs. During periods of low flow, concentrations of
   SO4 at the swamp outlets declined to less than 3 mg/l. At this time
   lower water table elevations resulted in increased interaction of input
   water with anoxic peats, and therefore, SO4 reduction. Contrasts in till
   depth and the nature of groundwater flow between catchments resulted in
   differences in SO4 dynamics between years and swamps. In dry summers the
   absence of groundwater inputs to the swamp in the catchment with thin
   till resulted in a large water table drawdown and re-oxidation of
   accumulated S, which contributed to maximum SO4 concentrations (up to 35
   mg/l) during storm runoff. Continuous groundwater input to the swamp in
   the catchment with deeper till was critical to maintaining saturated
   surfaces and efficient SO4 retention during both dry and wet summers. A
   conceptual model of wetland SO4 retention and export, based on catchment
   hydrogeology, is developed to generalize the SO4 dynamics of valley
   bottom wetlands at the landscape scale. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Monthly actual evapotranspiration (AET) for four humid catchments in
   Kenya, East Africa was evaluated using the Morton and Grindley models.
   The area of each catchment was less then 100 km(2) and all catchments
   lie around the equator. Three of the catchments are chiefly vegetated
   with pasture, annual and perennial crops, whereas one is largely under
   forest. The AET estimates from the aforementioned models were compared
   with those based on a water balance analysis. A total of 34 data years
   for daily rainfall and run off for all. the catchments were used for
   analysis. The results indicated that both models tended to overestimate
   AET in relation to the water balance-based values. The Grindley model
   (AET(G)) overestimated such that the estimates were either equal or
   close to the Penman potential evapotranspiration (PET) values in all the
   catchments. The Morton model (AET(M)) performed better, and AET
   estimates by this method, although marginally higher, were closer to the
   water balance-based estimates. The overall overprediction by the
   Grindley model on a monthly basis was of the order of 32\% whereas by
   the Morton model it was only 8\%. Although the mean values from the
   Morton model are only 8\% higher than the water balance values on a
   monthly basis, values of the RMSE (root mean square error) range between
   25 and 47 mm. The additional merit of the Morton model lies in its
   ability to provide estimates of AET based solely on meteorological data,
   which are readily available in Kenya, East Africa. (C) 1997 by John

Abstract = {{Errors in the kinematic wave and diffusion wave approximation for
   time-independent (or steady-state) cases of channel flow with momentum
   exchange included were derived for three types of boundary conditions:
   zero flow at the upstream end, and critical flow depth and zero depth
   gradient at the downstream end. The diffusion wave approximation was
   found to be excellent agreement with the dynamic wave approximation,
   with errors of less than 1\% for KF02 greater than or equal to 7.5 and
   up to 12\% for KF02 less than or equal to 0.75 for the upstream boundary
   condition of zero discharge adn finite depth, where the K is the
   kinematic wave number and F-0 is the Froude number. The kinematic wave
   approximation was reasonably accurate except at the channel boundaries
   and for small values of KF20 (less than or equal to 1). The accuracy of
   these approximations was significantly influenced by the downstream
   boundary condition both in terms of the error magnitude and the segment
   of the channel reach for which these approximations would be applicable.

Abstract = {{Detailed modelling of the hydrological setting of fen meadows appears to
   be possible provided that detailed information on geomorphology,
   hydrochemistry and piezometric heads is available fcr a number of years.
   In the Laegieskamp, a small wetland reserve located in the central part
   of The Netherlands, a piezometric monitoring network was sampled for
   water quality analysis and piezometric heads between 1986 and 1992.
   Average yearly discharge and recharge periods were used for FLOWNET
   calculations. First, the models were used to determine, with the help of
   information on water quality, the hydrological systems in the study
   area. Secondly, they were used to define the present and past
   hydrological setting of a fen meadow in the reserve. The hydrological
   systems and water quality in the study area have changed considerably
   over the past 65 years. At present the fen meadow is mainly fed by
   precipitation. The mineral-rich conditions favouring the fen meadow
   vegetation are thought to be maintained thanks to a clayey peat layer
   and an oscillating shallow water body that prevents rapid leaching of
   minerals. The sulphate content in the fen exhibits a pattern of temporal
   variation, which is related to the severity of the annual drought. Our
   study showed that groundwater flow is mainly lateral, instead of the
   assumed vertical infiltration of groundwater in previous regional
   studies. This led us to the conclusion that conservation and restoration
   perspectives are much better than previously expected. The polluted
   middle, deep groundwater is not a major threat to this fen at the
   moment. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the method of identification of the drainage network on
   its geomorphological characteristics and on its hydrological response is
   analysed. Blue lines, photo-interpreted networks and networks generated
   from digital elevation models (DEMs) by an automatic algorithm are
   compared with field observations for two small alpine catchments. The
   comparisons are carried out in quantitative terms by using several
   geomorphological indices and functions and by calculating the
   hydrological response of the networks as represented by their
   geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph (GIUH). The results show
   that the effect of the identification method on the geomorphological
   indices and on the hydrological response is significant, and that the
   threshold area for channel initiation is not constant. Moreover, the
   available data show a poor correlation between local slope and threshold
   area. Finally, the influence of the threshold area on the shape of the
   GIUH is larger when the residence time on the hillslopes is of the same
   order as the residence time in the network. In the opposite case, the
   variability of the flow velocity along the network seems to play an
   important role. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Maximum rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves are commonly
   applied to determine the design rainfall in water resource projects.
   Normally, the IDF relationship is derived from recording rain gauges. As
   the network of non-recording rain gauges (daily rainfall) in Taiwan has
   a higher density than recording rain gauges, attempts were made in this
   study to extend the IDF relationship to non-recording rain gauges.
   Eighteen recording rain gauges and 99 non-recording rain gauges over the
   Chi-Nan area in Southern Taiwan provide the data sets. The regional IDF
   formulae were generated for ungauged areas to estimate rainfall
   intensity for various return periods and rainfall durations larger than
   or equal to one hour. For rainfall durations less than one hour, a set
   of adjustment formulae were applied to modify the regional IDF formulae.
   The method proposed in this study had reasonable application to
   non-recording rain gauges, which was concluded from the verification of
   four additional recording rain gauges. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {{Recognition of a biofilm at the sediment-water interface of an acid mine
   drainage-contaminated stream, and its role in controlling iron flux}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Material collected over a month on plates attached to the bed of the
   Afon Coch, Anglesey, a stream highly contaminated by acid mine drainage
   (AMD), was either examined intact by electron microscopy or suspended
   and cultured to reveal the presence of microbiota. Certain of the
   aerobic microbiota were identified, the genus Pseudomonas formed the
   commonest isolate and cultures of Serratia plymuthica were grown in
   order to compare the biofilms formed with the material collected in the
   Afon Goch. The material at the sediment-water interface of the Afon Goch
   was of similar underlying morphology to that of the cultured biofilms.
   However, the former had a superficial granular coating of
   equidimensional (60-100 nm) and evenly spaced iron rich particles
   (determined by X-ray microanalysis). The sediment-water interface of
   this AMD-contaminated stream is therefore best described as a highly
   contaminated biofilm. Evidence from previous work suggests that the
   streambed is active in iron removal from the water column. The intimate
   association of iron with microbiota at the streambed, therefore, implies
   that iron flux prediction may not be possible from physical and chemical
   data alone but requires knowledge of biofilm physiology and ecology.
   Microbially mediated metal precipitation, both by single bacteria and by
   biofilms, has been reported elsewhere but mass balance considerations
   suggest that this explanation cannot hold good for the large amounts of
   iron hydroxide depositing from waters of the prevalent pH and redox
   status. Filtered stream water analyses indicate the presence of
   colloidal iron hydroxide and also its removal downstream where ochreous
   (iron hydroxide rich) material accumulates. The process of iron
   immobilization is likely to be the attraction and physical trapping of
   colloidal iron hydroxide by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)
   which constitute the matrix of biofilms. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Following the Painted Cave Fire of 25 June 1990 in Santa Barbara,
   California which burned 1214 ha, an emergency watershed protection plan
   was implemented consisting of stream clearing, grade stabilizers and
   construction of debris basins. Research was initiated focusing on
   hydrological response and channel morphology changes on two branches of
   Maria Ygnacio Creek, the main drainage of the burned area. Research
   results support the hypothesis that the response of small drainage
   basins in chaparral ecosystems to wildfire is complex and flushing of
   sediment by fluvial processes is more likely than by high magnitude
   debris flows.
   During the winter of 1990-1991, 35-66 cm of rainfall and intensities up
   to 10 cm per hour for a five-minute period were recorded with a seasonal
   total of 100\% of average (normal) rainfall (average = 63 cm/year).
   During the winter of 1991-1992, 48-74 cm of rainfall and intensities up
   to 8 cm per hour were recorded with a seasonal total of 115\% of normal.
   Even though there was moderate rainfall on barren, saturated soils, no
   major debris flows occurred in burned areas. The winter of 1992-1993
   recorded total precipitation of about 170\% of normal, annual average
   intensities were relatively low and again no debris flows were observed.
   The response to winter storms in the first three years following the
   fire was a moderate but spectacular flushing of sediment, most of which
   was derived from the hillslopes upstream of the debris basins. The first
   significant storm and stream flow of the 1990-1991 winter was
   transport-limited resulting in large volumes of sediment being deposited
   in the channel of Maria Ygnacio Creek; the second storm and stream flow
   was sediment-limited and the channel scoured. Debris basins trapped
   about 23 000 m(3), the majority coming from the storm of 17-20 March
   1991. Sediment transported downstream during the three winters following
   the fire and not trapped in the debris basins was eventually flushed to
   the estuarine reaches of the creeks below the burn area, where
   approximately 108 000 m(3) accumulated.
   Changes in stream morphology following the fire were dramatic as pools
   filled with sediment which greatly smoothed longitudinal and
   cross-sectional profiles. Major changes in channel morphology occur
   following a fire as sediment derived from the hillslope is temporarily
   stored in channels within the burned area. However, this sediment may
   quickly move downstream of the burned region, where it may accumulate
   reducing channel capacity and increasing the flood hazard.
   Ecological consequences of wildfire to the riparian zone of streams in
   the chaparral environment are virtually unknown, but must be significant
   as the majority of sediment (particularly gravel necessary for fish and
   other aquatic organisms) entering the system does so in response to
   fires. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The morphology of suspended sediment particles reflects the origin of
   the suspended load and any modifying processes that may have occurred
   during transport and storage in the aquatic system. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the use of four fractal dimensions to
   quantify visually observed changes in the morphology of fluvial
   suspended sediment particles during baseflow conditions. Samples were
   collected during summer low flow in a small stream on the Canadian
   Prairies. Particle morphology data were obtained with a transmitted
   light microscope, a CCD camera and an image analysis system. The
   morphology of the particle population was characterized using four
   fractal dimensions (D, D-K, D-1 and D-2). D was derived from the
   area-perimeter relationship and showed an increase from 1.26 +/- 0.02 on
   30 June, to 1.34 +/- 0.02 on 4 July, to 1.42 +/- 0.01 on 7 July.
   Visually, the increase in D represented the formation of large particles
   with intricate shapes and increased perimeters. D-K was determined from
   the area-rank relationship and varied from 1.86 +/- 0.01 on 30 June, to
   1.90 +/- 0.00 on 4 July, to 1.74 +/- 0.00 on 7 July. The decrease in D-K
   between 4 July and 7 July would indicate a greater concentration of the
   particle area over a small number of large particles. Although the
   decrease in D-K is consistent with observed changes in the particle size
   distributions, D-K should be used with the considerable caution because
   D-K varied more than one standard error between replicates. D-1 and D-2
   were determined from the length-perimeter and length-area relationships,
   respectively. D-1 proved to be of little value for quantifying changes
   in particle morphology as it showed little change with time, despite
   considerable visual changes. D-2 however, was useful, despite some
   variation between replicates. Over the sampling period, D-2 for the
   composite data sets showed a steady decrease from 1.74 +/- 0.02 on 30
   June, to 1.68 +/- 0.02 on 4 July, to 1.60 +/- 0.01 on 7 July. This
   change in D-2 indicates that, through time, the larger particles became
   longer and thinner relative to the smaller ones. This study shows that
   temporal changes in D, D-K and D-2 were consistent with, and allow
   quantification of, observed changes in particle morphology. D-1 did not
   reflect observed morphological changes, and is therefore of little value
   for this type of study. The changes in particle morphology coincided
   with an increase in primary production in the form of algae. (C) 1997 by

Abstract = {{Eight one-dimensional steady-state models with different complexity,
   which describe the phosphate concentration as a function of the distance
   along a river, were examined with respect to accuracy and uncertainty of
   the model results and identifiability of the model parameters by means
   of combined calibration and sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo
   simulations. In addition, the models were evaluated by the Akaike
   information criterion (AIC). All eight models were calibrated on the
   same data set from the Biebrza River, Poland. Although the accuracy
   increases with model complexity, the percentage of explained variance is
   not significantly improved in comparison with the model that describes
   the phosphate concentration by means of three parameters. This model
   also yields the minimum value of the AIC and the parameters could be
   well identified. Identification of the model parameters becomes poorer
   with increasing model complexity; in other words the parameters become
   increasingly correlated. This scarcely affects the uncertainty of the
   model results if correlation is taken into account. If correlation is
   not taken into account, the uncertainty of model results increases with

Abstract = {{Distributed hydrological models are becoming increasingly complex with
   respect to spatial phenomena, and with the widespread availability of
   spatial data from GIS, this trend is likely to increase. In all such
   models the spatial arrangement of phenomena, such as soil properties and
   land-use categories is fundamental, and so the arrangement should have
   an influence on the model output. Testing for this influence we term
   spatial sensitivity analysis. Here, we report on the spatial sensitivity
   of two widely used models, AgNPS (agricultural non-point source
   pollution model) and ANSWERS (areal nonpoint source watershed
   environment response simulation). The input spatial data were subjected
   to spatially random mixing to varying degrees, such that the organized
   landscape became disorganized. The chemical discharge from AgNPS, and
   the sediment and water discharge from ANSWERS, are examined. In both
   cases most outputs exhibited little or no sensitivity to the spatial
   distribution of most input data. Only infiltration-related inputs
   produced large variations, but these changes were not in the sense that
   might have been predicted. Although the analytical methods used require
   further refinement, there must now be some doubt as to the validity of
   the models, and whether they repay their computational complexity.
   Furthermore, it is felt that spatial sensitivity analysis should become
   a fundamental part of the verification of all such models. (C) 1997 by

Abstract = {{Conservative solute injections were conducted in three first-order
   montane streams of different geological composition to assess the
   influence of parent lithology and alluvial characteristics on the
   hydrological retention of nutrients. Three study sites were established:
   (1) Aspen Creek, in a sandstone-siltstone catchment with a fine-grained
   alluvium of low hydraulic conductivity (1.3 x 10(-4) cm/s), (2) Rio
   Calaveras, which flows through volcanic tuff with alluvium of
   intermediate grain size and hydraulic conductivity (1.2 x 10(-3) cm/s),
   and (3) Gallina Creek, located in a granite/gneiss catchment of coarse,
   poorly sorted alluvium with high hydraulic conductivity (4.1 x 10(-3)
   cm/s). All sites were instrumented with networks of shallow groundwater
   wells to monitor interstitial solute transport. The rate and extent of
   groundwater-surface water exchange, determined by the solute response in
   wells, increased with increasing hydraulic conductivity. The direction
   of surface water-groundwater interaction within a stream was related to
   local variation in vertical and horizontal hydraulic gradients.
   Experimental tracer responses in the surface stream were simulated with
   a one-dimensional solute transport model with inflow and storage
   components (OTIS). Model-derived measures of hydrological retention
   showed a corresponding increase with increasing hydraulic conductivity.
   To assess the temporal variability of hydrological retention, solute
   injection experiments were conducted in Gallina Creek under four
   seasonal flow regimes during which surface discharge ranged from
   baseflow (0.75 l/s in October) to high (75 l/s during spring snowmelt).
   Model-derived hydrological retention decreased with increasing
   discharge.
   The results of our intersite comparison suggest that hydrological
   retention is strongly influenced by the geologic setting and alluvial
   characteristics of the stream catchment. Temporal variation in
   hydrological retention at Gallina Creek is related to seasonal changes
   in discharge, highlighting the need for temporal resolution in studies
   of the dynamics of surface water-groundwater interactions in stream
   ecosystems. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Export coefficient modelling was used to model the impact of agriculture
   on nitrogen and phosphorus loading on the surface waters of two
   contrasting agricultural catchments. The model was originally developed
   for the Windrush catchment where the highly reactive Jurassic limestone
   aquifer underlying the catchment is well connected to the surface
   drainage network, allowing the system to be modelled using uniform
   export coefficients for each nutrient source in the catchment,
   regardless of proximity to the surface drainage network, In the Slapton
   catchment, the hydrological pathways are dominated by surface and
   lateral shallow subsurface flow, requiring modification of the export
   coefficient model to incorporate a distance-decay component in the
   export coefficients. The modified model was calibrated against observed
   total nitrogen and total phosphorus loads delivered to Slapton Ley from
   inflowing streams in its catchment. Sensitivity analysis was conducted
   to isolate the key controls on nutrient export in the modified model.
   The model was validated against long-term records of water quality, and
   was found to be accurate in its predictions and sensitive to both
   temporal and spatial changes in agricultural practice in the catchment.
   The model was then used to forecast the potential reduction in nutrient
   loading on Slapton Ley associated with a range of catchment management
   strategies. The best practicable environmental option (BPEO) was found
   to be spatial redistribution of high nutrient export risk sources to
   areas of the catchment with the greatest intrinsic nutrient retention
   capacity. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A limitation of existing models of water and solute movement in fen
   peats is that they fail to represent processes in the unsaturated zone.
   This limitation is largely due to a lack of data on the hydraulic
   properties of unsaturated peat, in particular the relationship between
   hydraulic conductivity (K) and pressure head (psi). A tension
   infiltrometer was used to measure K(psi) of a fen peat in Somerset,
   England. It was found that macropores could be important in water and
   solute movement in this soil type. It was also found that (i)
   variability of K in this peat was less than that reported for other
   peats and mineral soils, and (ii) the K data were better described by a
   log-normal distribution than a normal distribution in accord with
   findings from other peat and mineral soils. Recommendations on improving
   the understanding of water and solute movement in the unsaturated zone
   of this soil type are made. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons. Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic models offer an objective and quantitative method of
   analysing the behaviour of discrete hydrological variables. For the
   Algeciras semi-arid stream in south-east Spain, homogeneous first- and
   second-order Markov chains were applied to rainfall and runoff series in
   order to establish the length of the rainy sequences using probability
   as well as the beginning and duration of runoff. At the same time, a
   stochastic process was devised based on two subsystems, one for
   rainfall, modelled as a four-state n-order Markov chain, and another for
   transition of runoff depending on the former subsystem. By considering
   the median rainfall obtained in each season as a class threshold, the
   possible number of states in the first subsystem is raised to nine,
   giving more complicated stochastic matrices which, without using an
   excessive number of parameters, allow better description and prediction
   of the transition from rainfall to runoff. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Thirteen equations based on the mass-transfer method for determining
   free water evaporation were expressed in seven generalized equations.
   These seven equations were then compared with pan evaporation at four
   climatological stations in north-western Ontario, Canada. The
   comparisons were based on monthly evaporation. Equations were compared
   by calibrating them on the entire data sets as well as by calibrating on
   part of the data and then verifying them on the remainder of the data.
   The results of comparison showed that all equations were in reasonable
   agreement with observed evaporation, and that the effect of wind
   velocity on monthly evaporation was marginal. However, when an equation
   with parameters obtained at one site was applied to compute evaporation
   at another site, the computed evaporation was not in good agreement with
   observed values. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides the first detailed estimate of riverine organic
   carbon fluxes in British rivers, as well as highlighting major gaps in
   organic carbon data in national archives. Existing data on organic
   carbon and suspended solids concentrations collected between 1989 and
   1993, during routine monitoring by the River Purification Boards (RPBs)
   in Scotland and the National River Authorities (NRAs) in England and
   Wales, were used with annual mean flows to estimate fluxes of dissolved
   and particulate organic carbon (DOG and POC) in British rivers. Riverine
   DOC exports during 1993 varied from 7.7-10.35 kg ha(-1) year(-1), with a
   median flux of 31.9 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the 85 rivers for which data
   were available. There was a trend for DOC fluxes to increase from the
   south and east to the north and west. A predictive model based on mean
   soil carbon storage in 17 catchments, together with regional
   precipitation totals, explained 94\% of the variation in the riverine
   DOC exports in 1993. This model was used to predict riverine DOC fluxes
   in regions where no organic carbon data were available. Calculated and
   predicted fluxes were combined to produce an estimate for exports of DOC
   to tidal waters in British rivers during 1993 of 0.68 +/- 0.07 Mt. Of
   this total, rivers in Scotland accounted for 53\%, England 38\% and
   Wales 9\%. Scottish blanket peats would appear to be the largest single
   source of DOC exports in British rivers. An additional 0.20 Mt of
   organic carbon were estimated to have been exported in particulate form
   in 1993, approximately two-thirds of which was contributed by English
   rivers. It is suggested that riverine losses of organic carbon have the
   potential to affect the long-term dynamics of terrestrial organic carbon
   pools in Britain and that rivers may regulate increases in soil carbon
   pools brought about by climate change. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of quantifying real world catchment
   response using a distributed model and discusses the ability of the
   model to capture that response. The rainfall-runoff responses of seven
   small agricultural catchments in the eastern wheatbelt region of
   south-western Australia are examined. The variability in runoff
   generation and the factors that contribute to that variability (i.e.
   rainfall intensity, soil properties and topography) are investigated to
   determine if their influence can be captured in a mathematical model.
   The spatially distributed rainfall-runoff model used in this study is
   based on the TOPMODEL concepts of Beven and Kirkby (1979), and simulates
   runoff generation by both the infiltration excess and saturation excess
   mechanisms. Simulations with the model revealed the highly complex
   nature of catchment response to rainfall events. Runoff generation was
   highly heterogeneous in both space and time, with the runoff response
   being governed by the spatial variability of soil properties and
   topography, and by the temporal variation in rainfall intensity.
   Although the model proved capable of simulating catchment response for
   many events, the investigation has demonstrated that not all aspects of
   the variability associated with agricultural catchments (particularly
   the effects of land management) can be captured using this relatively
   simple model. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Monthly mean data from a 90 year period relating to a small catchment
   (1424 . km(2)) in north-central Austria were used to provide a long-term
   perspective on the nature of the air-water temperature relationship.
   Annual mean values of air and water temperature were related in a
   relatively insensitive and scattered way (r(2) < 55\%, b < 0 . 65),
   whereas the relationship for monthly mean values was closer and steeper
   (r(2) > 95\%, b > 0 . 65). A separate regression equation was needed to
   describe the behaviour of monthly mean water temperatures as the air
   temperatures fell below freezing. Analysis of air-water temperature
   regressions for individual months revealed a series of relations which
   were generally more scattered and less, but variously, sensitive than
   the ensemble relationship of monthly mean values. Monthly mean water
   temperatures could be predicted from the ensemble air-water temperature
   relationship and from the relations for individual months with root mean
   square errors of > 1 . 0 and < 0 . 8 degrees C, respectively.
   Segmentation of air-water temperature regressions according to air
   temperatures above and below freezing did not significantly improve
   water temperature prediction. Hysteresis in, and the relatively low
   slope of, the air-water temperature relationships in the study catchment
   reflected the importance of snowmelt in the flow regime.}},

Abstract = {{Under winter conditions, stemflow drainage in forested ecosystems is
   often assumed to be a negligible component of the hydrological cycle.
   This paper reports on mid-winter stemflow drainage from the broadleaved
   deciduous tree species Populus grandidentata. Stemflow volumes from this
   species at air temperatures of < 0 degrees C were found to be comparable
   to rainfall-generated stemflow during summer. Over the three-month
   period January-March 1993, stemflow ranged from 5.4 to 9.9\% of the
   incident gross precipitation. Expressed as depth equivalents per unit
   trunk basal area, these stemflow inputs ranged from 1.8 to 4.9 m. These
   concentrated mid-winter inputs of liquid water to the bases of canopy
   trees were attributable to: (1) snow interception by the leafless woody
   frame of each tree; (2) snow retention by glazed ice precipitation
   associated with the snowfall event; (3) increased temperature at the
   bark/snow interface caused by the low albedo of the bark tissue; and (4)
   convergence of snowmelt drainage from steeply inclined upthrust primary
   branches. The hydrological and ecological significance of liquid water
   inputs to the forest floor under sub-zero conditions are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Previously unpublished water quality data are used to explore the
   potassium chemistry of a small upland stream following the 1976 drought
   in England. The behaviour of potassium is a complex response to several
   factors: hydrological pathways operating during periods of storm runoff;
   sediment inputs; and the chemical properties of the transporting water.
   Analyses of `hysteresis loops' for a series of storms show that the
   relationship between suspended sediment and potassium concentrations is
   not simple; spatial and temporal variations in surface and subsurface
   stormflow add complexity. In addition to the specific discussion of
   potassium, data are presented to show the recovery of stream discharge,
   and of sediment and solute concentrations during the immediate
   post-drought period.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of water content in time and space at the soil surface
   has been investigated on a small farmland catchment (1 . 3 km(2)) from
   four held surveys corresponding to different moisture statuses. For each
   survey, about 400 samples were collected at the soil surface at a depth
   of 5 cm along ten axes parallel to the greatest slope. The relationship
   between the measurements and the topography has been analysed. The
   structure of the data is well explained by a topographic index referring
   to the downslope conditions and defined as the elevation difference
   between the sample point and the stream point corresponding to the
   outlet of the water pathway derived from the digital elevation model
   (DEM). This index can be considered as an hydraulic head, at least for
   saturated conditions. A threshold for this index allows two domains
   within the catchment to be distinguished; an upper domain where the
   water content is nearly constant and varies slowly, and a lower domain
   where moisture status increases and is highly variable. The spatial
   distribution of these two domains is well correlated to the spatial
   distribution of the soils. Thus, both topography and the spatial
   distribution of soil appear to control the spatial distribution of
   surface water content at the 1-km(2) scale.}},

Abstract = {{A GeoVision Micro(R) colour video camera was used to investigate the
   internal structure of 11 boreholes at Haut Glacier d'Arolla,
   Switzerland. The boreholes were distributed across a half-section of the
   glacier, with closest spacing towards the glacier margin. The boreholes
   were used to investigate the hydrology of the glacier through automatic
   monitoring of borehole water level and electrical conductivity (EC) at
   the glacier bed. EC profiling was undertaken in several boreholes to
   determine the existence of water quality stratification. Temporal
   variations in EC stratification were used to infer borehole water
   sources and patterns of water circulation. Borehole video was used to
   confirm the conclusions made from these indirect sources of evidence,
   and to provide an independent source of information on the structure and
   hydrology of this temperate valley glacier. The video showed variations
   in water turbidity, englacial channels and voids, conditions at the
   glacier bed and down-borehole changes in ice structure. Based on the
   video observations, englacial channels accounted for approximately 0 .
   1\% of the vertical ice thickness, and englacial voids for approximately
   0 . 4\%. Overall, the video images provided useful qualitative and
   semi-quantitative data that reinforce interpretations of a range of
   physical and chemical parameters measured in boreholes.}},

Abstract = {{Models based on gridded maps provide a simple and flexible way of
   modelling hydrological processes at the catchment scale. Such a model is
   described for humid temperate regions where no regional aquifer is
   present. The catchment is represented by a grid of 50 x 50 m
   interconnected cells. These are characterized by the depth and porosity
   of the soil layer, the slope and direction of drainage, the possible
   presence of a stretch of river and the presence or absence of forest
   canopy. Three types of hydrological processes are modelled: throughflow
   (described by a modified version of Darcy's law); channel how (described
   by Manning's equation); and the interception-evaporation process as
   dependent on the presence or absence of forest canopy. The model
   predicts the hydrograph at the catchment outlet and the location of
   rivers in the catchment. These are compared with the observed river
   network, thus providing an additional means of assessing the model. (C)

Abstract = {{The use of digital elevation models (DEMs) allows the automatic
   derivation of channel networks and the quantitative description of the
   geomorphic characteristics of basins. A common method of channel network
   extraction from DEM data is based on the specification of a threshold
   area (A(t)) that is the minimum support area required to drain to a
   point for a channel to form. Usually, an arbitrary constant threshold
   area value is chosen for channel network extraction. In this study the
   effects of threshold area selection, both on the morphometric and
   scaling properties (such as drainage density, total channel length,
   Horton laws and fractal dimension) of a channel network and the
   associated hydrological response function are analysed. The response is
   obtained following the geomorphological instantaneous unit hydrograph
   theory. Two different probabilistic models are used. They both relate
   the characteristic response function of the basin to its DEM data
   derived networks: one is derived assuming a Strahler stream ordering
   system and the other is obtained by averaging a flow equation with
   respect to the network structure (described by the width function).
   Applications are shown for three mountainous basins in the Italian Alps.
   A sensitivity analysis is performed to study the influence of the
   variability of morphometric properties, with respect to A(t), on the
   hydrological response obtained. It is shown that the model based on the
   width function is able to reduce the effects of this variability on the
   simulated response. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Subsurface lateral flow has previously been identified in dune areas
   where the average annual rainfall exceeds 200 mm. Very little is known
   about subsurface flow in sandy deserts with less than 100 mm of rainfall
   per year. The present study deals with the water regime in a system of
   longitudinal dunes in the Negev desert. Sixteen boreholes were dug, down
   to a depth of 6 m, across a sandy ridge and the adjacent corridor. Soil
   moisture and water movement were monitored with a neutron probe during
   two consecutive years. The first year had been relatively wet and in the
   following year the rainfall was slightly lower than the long-term
   average. The data obtained show that in an average year water
   percolation is limited to 60 cm with no lateral water movement. Deeper
   percolation, in the range 180-400 cm, occurs in response to rainy spells
   with about 100 mm of cumulative rain within two months. The process
   involves subsurface lateral flow and water movement by the piston
   effect. The lateral flow, on the flanks of the dune, is explained by
   differences in hydraulic conductivities within the sloping layers. (C)

Title = {{Variability in the chemical composition of in situ subglacial meltwaters}},
Journal = {{HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-77}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Meltwaters collected from boreholes drilled to the base of the Haut
   Glacier d'Arolla, Switzerland have chemical compositions that can be
   classified into three main groups. The first group is dilute, whereas
   the second group is similar to, though generally less concentrated in
   major ions, than contemporaneous bulk glacial runoff. The third group is
   more concentrated than any observed bulk runoff, including periods of
   flow recession. Waters of the first group are believed to represent
   supraglacial meltwater and ice melted during drilling. Limited solutes
   may be derived from interactions with debris in the borehole. The
   spatial pattern of borehole water levels and borehole water column
   stratification, combined with the chemical composition of the different
   groups, suggest that the second group represent samples of subglacial
   waters that exchange with channel water on a diurnal basis, and that the
   third group represent samples of water draining through a `distributed'
   subglacial hydraulic system. High NO3- concentrations in the third group
   suggest that snowmelt may provide a significant proportion of the waters
   and that the residence time of the waters at the bed in this particular
   section of the distributed system is of the order of a few months. The
   high NO3- concentrations also suggest that some snowmelt is routed along
   different subglacial flowpaths to those used by icemelt. The average
   SO42-: (HCO3- + SO42-) ratio of the third group of meltwaters is 0.3,
   suggesting that sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution (which
   gives rise to a ratio of 0.5) cannot provide all the HCO3- to solution.
   Hence, carbonate hydrolysis may be occurring before sulphide oxidation,
   or there may be subglacial sources of CO2, perhaps arising from
   microbial oxidation of organic C in bedrock, air bubbles in glacier ice
   or pockets of air trapped in subglacial cavities. The channel marginal
   zone is identified as an area that may influence the composition of bulk
   meltwater during periods of recession flow and low diurnal discharge
   regimes. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed hydrometeorological measurements have been used to establish
   the components of the river heat budget for 495 days covering 18 study
   periods and 11 study reaches in the Exe Basin, Devon, UK. Averaging the
   results across the whole data-set indicates that net radiation,
   friction, sensible heat transfer, condensation and bed conduction
   contributed 56.0, 22.2, 13.2, 5.8 and 2.8\%, respectively, to the
   non-advective energy gains, whereas net radiation, evaporation, sensible
   heat exchange and bed conduction accounted for 48.6, 30.4, 10.6 and
   10.4\%, respectively, of the non-advective heat losses. Precipitation
   falling on the river channel had little impact on the river heat
   budgets, but energy advected in groundwater accounted for an average 5\%
   of the heat storage in the river. The magnitude and importance of the
   river heat budget components were found to be variable in space and
   time. The influence of channel morphology, valley topography, riparian
   vegetation, substratum nature and hydrological conditions, especially
   the effects of river regulation, promoted inter-reach variability in the
   make up of the heat budget and caused significant differences in energy
   fluxes at a local scale. Heat budget components also exhibited
   considerable differences between seasons and varied from day to day for
   individual reaches. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons.}},

Abstract = {{Piezometric head data from various depths were examined at two peatlands
   in Ontario, Canada and one peatland in Sweden influenced by small-scale,
   shallow groundwater systems. Data from different hydrogeological
   settings show reversals in groundwater flow leading to discharge in
   topographically high regions of peatlands in isolation from large-scale
   groundwater flow. It is suggested that subsurface flow within peat can
   reverse in direction in response to water deficit and water-table
   drawdown. The data presented here refute the assumption that local
   groundwater flow in peatlands is unidirectional and further illustrate
   the fact that measurable subsurface water flow can occur at depth in
   peat isolated from large-scale groundwater flow systems. In the light of
   implicit assumptions made by many workers on water movement in
   peatlands, especially when connected to small-scale groundwater systems,
   the consequences of such reversals are paramount in understanding the
   hydrology and biogeochemistry of peatlands. (C) 1997 by John Wiley \&
